INEW YORK: STRINGER &amp; TOWNSEND, 222 BROADWAY. 1857.  &#xD;<pb n="" xml:id="VAC7492-00000003"/> Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1857, by STRINGER &amp; TOWNSEND, in the Clerk's office of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. R. ORAIGHEAD, PRINTER AND STEREOTYEB, CSa.3ton 3utifbLinqg,- 81, 83 8 85 Centre Sreet.   PREFACE. WHEN   Shakspere said, "What's in a name?" he certainly evinced his total ignorance of the American people in general, and the New York- ers in particular. Nor had he the slightest idea of the trouble it has given the editor of this volume to find a title to suit the taste of his excellent publishers. The first we suggested pleased one of them, but did not come up to the mark of the other. The next threw him into a state of rapture, while it perfectly disgusted his partner. A third attempt of ours provoked them so exten- sively that we narrowly escaped a trip to Canada. "( What do you say to Otto of Roses?" we meekly inquired. "Not worth a cent," rejoined they. We ventured a pun upon otto of roses being a very decided scent, but without pro- voking a laugh. After many important meetings, at which lager bier was sometimes called for to stimulate 'our inven- tion, a happy idea struck all three simultaneously, and we concluded to advertise. "WANTED A NAME," therefore, headed an advertisement in the daily papers, and numerous were the replies we received. Had we advertised for a wife we could not have received more attention. Twelve  &#xD;<pb n="iv-v" xml:id="VAC7492-00000004"/> IV         PREFACE. correspondents insisted upon A"PUNCH ;" seventeen chose "TODDY FOR THE MLLION ;" not a few boldly proposed "LUNCH ;" while one modest female handwriting advised us to adopt "LOVE WHSPERS." A western man, who evi- dently wrote with the butt-end of his revolver, said "STREAKS OF LIGHTNING' was the thing; and a Connec- ticut lady thought that nothing was so expressive as "PUMPKIN PIE."   "MNCE-MEAT" was the chosen cog- nomen of a down-east beauty; while an Englishman roundly ordered us to call the book "PLUM PUDDING," under the threat of a British squadron bombarding our city. Our esteemed friend, John Smith, the acknowledged head of that numerous family, promised us the patronage of all the Smiths if we would only call it the -"SMTHY ;" while the czar of all the Jones threatened us with his indignation if we did not name it "TOM JONts," after his favorite novel. An old salt recommended us to hail it "THE COMMODORE'S OWN ;" while a deputation came from Cin- cinnati to- advise the propriety of heading it "PORK AND BEANS," '"MUSH FOR THE MLLION" had its advocates, as also had "MY VALISE ;" while "SOFT SOAP," "PRO- VENDER FOR A JOURNEY," "THE STEAM WHSTLE," ' THE BOWIE KNIFE," and ("TAKE MY HAT," had their sugges- tfers. Some; in their communications, said they wanted a book' full of philosophy-others went in strong for fun. Some -worthy correspondents declared that there was nothing like facts. A Fifth Avenue lady implored us, if we wanted to preserve her affections, to condense the choice romances into one page apiece, and thus make our volume the pem- mican of fiction. Our reason was almost sinking beneath this avalanche of good advice, when a friend cut the Gordian knot, by-telling us how he got the best wife in all   PREFACE.            V creation, at a time when the numerous virtues of sixteen rival Californian widows distracted his choice--by writing their names on. slips of paper, putting them into his hat, shaking them up, and, trusting to Providence, dipped in and selected one. We adopted his plan, and have drawn the name of "CHT-CHAT," which we think most expressive of that mixture of fact, fun, fancy, philosophy, and freaks of adventure, so calculated to while away the tedium of a journey, that-like the Frenchman, who had invented a sauce so piquant that a man might eat his own grandmother with relish--so we modestly opine our book is so enter- taining that its perusal will make even the bursting of a boiler agreeable, and reconcile the timidest of travellers to the most frightful railroad catastrophes.

IT was pretty well known that Grimaldi, the   celebrated clown, was in the habit of receiv- ing  his salary every Saturday night from the treasurer of Sad- letrs-Wells theatre, and driving home with it in his gig to Finch- ley, about midnight. One night he saw, as he rode along, sitting on a mile-stone, on the London side of the Finchley turnpike, an old woman, with a basket. She seemed to be so fa- tigued that Grimaldi pulled up, and said, "What's the matter, mother "   "Oh!" said the old woman, in a   feeble voice, "I am ill, and am afraid I cannot walk to Finchley." "Jump in," said the good-na- Actors have sharp eyes, and it struck Grimaldi that the manner in which she got into the gig was not the wayr in which a woman does that " kind of thing." - When she was in she put the basket, which had 'a coverto it, down at her feet. Grimald, having-his suspicions aroused, resolved to draw her out in conversation.  Hier voice was evidently a man's voice, dis- guised. "Hollo!" thought Grimaldi, , I am doomed to be robbed, and perhaps murdered; this is a  pretty go. I cannot attack this mIan or  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7492-00000008"/> C H T-O CHAT, woman on mere suspicion, while he can choose his own time to over- power me." In this uncomfortable state h6 drove for a few minutes, when an expedient presented itself, which he resolved to put in practice. In appearing to whip his horse he flourished his whip over his head, and managed so as to knock his own hat off. Pulling up his horse, he. cried, "Mother, I am sorry to trouble an old lady, but my horse is restive and I dare not trust the rein out of my own hand. Just get out, and pick up my hat for me." The woman, after some little hesitation, complied, but the very minute she had got out Grimaldi whipped his horse, and dashed off at full speed. A volley of oaths, in a most unmistakable manly voice, con- vinced Grimaldi that his conjectures were right, and that he had just had a very narrow escape. Upon examining the, basket, a pair of pistols, ready loaded and primed, was found. Grimaldi thus exchanged his hat for the pistols. TE LOST FOREIFINGER.-On another occasion when the famous clown was walking home one evening from a friend's house, at Enfield, he was stopped by a footpad, who, presenting a pistol to his head, de- manded in a fierce voice " his money or his life!'"Grimaldi was com- pelled to surrender his purse, but strange to say, ithe robber left him his watch, although there was quite sufficient light to see the glittering seals at the fob. Grimaldi noticed when the man held the pistol up, that he had lost his forefinger. Some three months afterwards, as he was sit- ting one evening at the Tiger's Head, Highgate, a laboring man came in, and sitting down at the next table called for a mug of ale. The voice arrested Grimaldi's attention. "Where can I have heard that voice," thought he; " it seems connected with a very unpleasant me- mory!"  At last he came to the conclusion that it was the robber's voice; he therefore watched him as he took out the money to pay, and sure enough, " the man had no forefinger." As they were- the only two in the 'room, Grimaldi rose and sat down opposite to him. The man seemed uneasy, and was about rising to go, when Joe said, "I want to say a word to you. You are the man -who stopped me on the road lately, and robbed me. Why should I not give you into custody?" The poor fellow seemed ready to drop, as he said, "For God's sake, listen first. I was then, and now am, almost starving. I have a wife and three children at home,-nothing but distress drove me to that crime. It was the first and last time I was ever guilty of dishonesty."   1H-IT- CHAT.             8 "How do I know that you are not lying now " said Grimaldi- "Will you come to the end of the village and see where I liveP I swear it will be quite safe; but don't expose me to my wife." "Oh, I don't fear the devil himself " returned Grimaldi, " when I am prepared. I will go with you." In a few minutes he entered the cottage. There he found a poor, genteel, half-starved, miserable woman, and three children.  Sure enough there was misery. Grimaldi sat down on an- old chair, and after looking at the family held out his hand to the unhappy man, and burst into tears. This was too much for the involuntary foot- pad, and he cried too. Grimaldi gave the poor fellow all he had, and also his address, saying, "When you are in distress come to me 1"The man accompa- nied him back to the village to buy some food, and with a faltering voice uttered a few words of gratitude. Some two or three years afterwards, on the morning of Grimaldi's benefit, a gentleman called at his house when he was out, and bought a large quantity of tickets. This was repeated four several times- whenever the great clown had a benefit. Grimaldi's curiosity was raised, and he resolved to watch, when his next benefit came. The morning passed, but no mysterious stranger came, and Grimaldi was obliged to go out. He had not left the house long ere the stranger came, bought his usual number of tickets, and went away. On his return in the afternoon he cross-questioned his servant closely, as to the personal appearance of the gentleman. "Oh," said the servant, "the only thing I noticed about him was that he had no forefinger--it seems to have been cut off." "That will do," cried Grimaldi. "I know who my mysterious friend now, is!" Some years ago Grimaldi received a letter from the honest robber in- closing a bank note for a hundred pounds, and announcing his emigra- tion to America-he stated that he had -prospered, and that some money had been left him by a relative. He thanked Grimaldi most fervently, and bade him farewell by letter, not daring again to look him in the face.  Grimaldi often quoted this as a proof of the superior efficacy of judging gently of our fellow creatures.

Paying down his subscription for three months, he walked away. Being on the eve of going into the country he did not take any books then, but on his return to London, nearly four months afterwards, he called and asked for the work in question. The clerk looked over the names, and said, "Your subscription has expired, sir; I cannot let you have any books until you have paid another quarter in advance." The wrath of the Irish dramatist was roused, so he soundly rated the clerk, declaring that "Saunders &amp; Otley were a couple of swindlers!" One of the partners hearing this came forward, and reproached Mr. Knowles for his personal insult. , aPersonal, my dear sir," said the wit, "not a bit of it-rif you are Mr. Saunders, damn Mr. Otley; if you are Mr. Otley, damn Mr. Saun- ders; I would not be personal for the world 1" The partner smiled at the felicitous retort, and put Knpwles on the free list.

Among other extravagancies he hired the whole of, a thea- tre, paid down the money, and having ordered the performance, just as he would a dinner, arrived at seven o'clock with his sweetheart. When they had entered, he told the doorkeeper to lock the door, as he had paid for all, and he meant to keep it all for Sally and himself. Taking a central position in the pit, he turned his back to'the stage, as the curtain rose, saying, "Now, Sally, you see that all's fair on your side" (meaning the stage), " and I'll take care that the lubbers don't cheat me, by letting anybody in." Spying the doorkeeper putting his head in during the performance, Jack turned round to the performers and cried, "Douse the curtain--there's some fellow looking;" then turning to the doorkeeper, he bawled out, "Sheer off, you land-lubber, or I'll pour a broadside into you." In this manner there sat Sally facing the stage, and Jack the boxes during the whole performance. GnmI are of age at twenty-one, and cease to be of age when they are married.

The Bashful Man.-WASHNGTON IRVING at a party in England, one day playfully asserted, that the love of annexation which the Anglo- Saxon race displayed on every occasion, proceeded probably from its mauvaise honte rather than its greediness. As a proof he cited the story of a bashful friend of his, who being asked to a dinner party, sat down to the table next to the hostess in a great state of excitement, owing to his recluse life. A few glasses of wine mounting to his brain, completed his confusion, and dissipated the small remains of his presence of mind. Casting his eyes down he saw on his lap some white linen. "My heavens," thought he, " that's my shirt protruding at my waisthand." He immediately commenced to tuck in the offending portion of his dress, but the more he tucked in, the more there -seemed to remain.- At last he made- a desperate effort, when a sudden crash around him, and a scream from the company, brought him to his senses. He had been all the time stuffing the table-cloth into his breeches, and the last time had swept everything clean off the table. Thus our bashful friend annexed a table-cloth, thinking it the tail of his own shirt.   Cl I T - CHA T.

( How rapidly they build houses now," said Cornelius to an old ac- quaintance, as he pointed to a two-story house: " they commenced that building only last week, and they are already putting in the lights."

It was at Croydon fair, a place about ten miles from London. Great was the wonder of the chawhacons, as they saw the mysterious booth, which had spunqg up like a mushroom in the night. The leader of the band, a sort of Max Maretzek, was an orchestra in -himself, for he performed on four instruments, all -at once. He had a peal of bells fastened to his hat, which jingled whenever he nodded; a row of reeds was fastened to his chin, which he played on as he rolled his head from side to side; with' his hands he scraped a fiddle; while to one knee and a foot he had two drumsticks tied, with which he beat the drum before him. After enjoying the overffire, which was made up of the fag ends of various tunes, finishing off with the beginnings of others, I paid a penny, and entered the inner temple. What was in it will be best described by the lecturer, who said: "Ladies and gents-this here is a menagerie so called, because it takes a man of hintellect like me to manage the critters. That ere hanimal is a hallegory; it grows on tip banks of the Nile, and is amphibilious, which is the French for saying, ' it can't live on land, and dies in the water '-a painful proof of the delicacy of its constitution, and the unsartainty of human life. The next hanimal is a cammylion. Ht's a regular box of colors. The ancients took their idea of the rainbow, and a woman's dress, from it: when it's black it's green, and when it's yellow it's blue, ail d wise woarsa. Thus affording a salutary example of the fallowhiliowness of the human senses, for there has been more hard swearing in the. courts of law about the exact color of this here animal than has ever been heard, except in New York, the capital of the Chocktaw Americans. The next critter is a hyenas It imitates all the;vartues of man; for instance, it has the agreeable smile of a young woman, and can. imitate the crying of a child. so naturally, that it inweigles unsuspectous people into the woods, and then dewours them-a shocking,proof of human ingratitude. "That ere animal in the corner is a hape, of the monkish kind. Some of its habits are so werry disgusting that it has been considered as be- longing to the human species itself. ".The critter with a long nose is a helephant. It is a native of a land whose name is so long and outlandish that it takes a man a month to pronounce it, three weeks to hear it, and eight years to understand it. 1   ;  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7492-00000012"/> 10            OHT-OHAT.

Ah, you don't want to wait a month, then please pay a penny all around, children half- price. Barney, collect the money, and point out the gemman what wont pay to the bull-dog; he's very hungry, not having been fed for a week, he'd relish a mean fellow now amazingly. (Money is easily collected.) That ere animal, ladies and gents, is, as I said before, the elephant. It's so big in its natural state that it takes two ships to bring one whole to this island, and then its trunk is obliged to be sent by post. It's an nanimal of great sagacity, being addicted to squirt upon tailors, who are sure enough, ladies and gents, the most obstopu- lous of mnankind. I give you my sacred honor, that only last night I ordered a snip of this place to send me a new pair of pantaloons home, and he would not leave them without the money. A dreadful proof of the depravity of tailors I And if the ninth part of a man be so great a waggabond, what must not an entire human critter be?

Pretty Incident.--We heard a very pretty little incident the other day, which we cannot help relating. A young lady from the South, it seems, was wooed and won by a youthful physician, living in California. When the engagement was made, the doctor was rich, having been very: successful at San Francisco. It' had tnot existed six months, however, when, by an unfortunate investment, he lost his entire "heap." This event came upon him, it should be added, just as he was making ready to come and claim :hisbride. - What does he do I Why, like an honora- ble, chivalrous young fellow, as'he is, he sits down, and writes the lady every particular of the-ithhappyyturn which had taken place in his for- tunes, assuring her, that if the fact produced bany change in her feelings towards him, she is released from every promise she had made him. And, what does the dear, good girl do? Why, she takes a lump of pure gold which her lover had sent to her while in prosperity, as a'keepsake, and having it manufactured into a ring, 'forwards it to him, with 'the following bible inscription, 'engraved -in distinct .characters on 'the inside: "Entreat me not to leave thee-or-to return from following after thee; for whither:thou goest,iI will go; and where thou lodgest, will I lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest will I die; and there will I be buried; the Lord do so to me and more also, if aught'but death-part thee and me." The lover'idolized'his sweetfheart more than ever when he received this precious evidence of her devotion to him both in storm and sun- shine. We may add, that fortune soon again smiled upon the young ,physician, and that he subsequently returned to the North, to wed the sweet girl he loved, and who -loved'him with such undying affection. Nay, more, the happy bride and bridegroom passed 'through 'our city, not long since, on their way to :the home of the 'latter in the 'Golden State. 'Reader,'this is all true. Young ladies who read the :bible as closely as the heroine of our incident seems to have done, "are pretty sure to make good sweethearts, and better wives. THE other day an Irishman applied at the New York Railway sta- tion, asking the fare to'Harlem, how far:it was off, and what time the next train would leave-when he received an answer:to each question.

New Jersey Judges.--There is a scriptural simplicity about the following which is quite refireshing, and carries one back to antedilu- vian times. A distinguished member of the New York- bar was retained on one occasion by a friend, also a New Yorker, to attend to a complaint made against him before a New Jersey Justice, for an alleged assault and battery upon one of the residents of the "Old Jersey State." "I appear for the prisoner," said the counsellor to the modern Dogherry.   "You abbers for de bris'ner, do you; and who den be you?" inter- rupted the justice, eyeing him from head to foot, with marked curiosity. "I ton't knows you; vair be's you come from, and vot's yer name@" The counsellor, modestly gave his name, and said, I . "I am a member of the New York bar." "Vell den," replied the justice, "you gan't bractis in dis here gort." "I am a counsellor of the Supreme Court of the State of New York," reiterated the attorney. "Dat makes not'ing tifferent," said the inveterate justice. "Well then," said the baffled lawyer, "suppose I show to your honor that I am a counsellor of the Supreme Court of the United States?" "It ton't make a pit petter," replied he of the ermine; " you ain't a counsellor von de State of New Jersey, and you gan't bractis in dish gort." This decision accounts for the fact that New Jersey is not in the United States!

The attorney of the opponent pestered her with so much of chicanery and legal subtleties that she lost all patience, and interrupted him thus: "My lord, the case is simply this : I bespoke of my opponent, the carpet-maker, a carpet with figures which were to be as handsome as my lord the judge, and he wants now to force me to take one with horrible caricatures, uglier even than his attorney? Was I not right in breaking off the bargain?" The court laughed at the comparison; the attorney was stupified;' and the woman 'Won her suit. PERSEVERANCE will do more than we may at first be aware of; if it will not remove every difficulty, it will certainly remove many; the most persevering may sometimes be disappointed; but those who are careless and indifferent are; doubtless, disappointed much oftener. The Marriage Ceremony.--An anecdote is related by Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, in one of his Free Soil speeches, to this effect- A couple came to me one night, and wished me to join them in wedlock. I consented to perform the ceremony, and said to the man- "Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife?" "Certainly," he replied. "Do yotu take this man to be your lawful husband?" "Yes, I do." "Then you are man and wife-that's all." Both looked at me with great astonishment, and the lady asked- "Is that all!" "Yes, that's all." "Well," she remarked, " taint such a mighty affair after all."

A lady remarked, "If the prizes were awarded by vote, this picture would certainly gain the first prize; for the' eyes' would have it"  A PLAIN CASE.-A learned Serjeant being lame of one leg, and plead- ing before Judge Fortescue, who had little or no nose, the Judge told him he was afraid he had but a lame cause of it.

WONDERS OF MESMERM.--At a recent mesmeric lecture, in Exeter, one of the experiments most signally failed, to the chagrin of the lec- turer. Having, as he fancied, mesmerised a table and a man's hand, and by some means held the two so effectually together that it all de- pended on his single will whether they should ever again be parted, he placed a shilling in tempting proximity to the hand "in a fix," and ex- claimed, "There now, my man, if you can take up that shilling you may have it."

CHT-CHAT,              1 Honesty -of a 'Roaitu Servant.--An Englishwoman who held ,an appointment in the Emperor's winter palace delivered to a carrier five hundred rubles-(a ruble is about seven pence English money)- to carry to her daughter, who lived at some distance. Next day the man came back to the lady, kissed her hands, and said, "Forgive me, I am in fault; I have lost your money, I know not how, and have search- ed everywhere, but cannot find it. Do with me what you think proper." The lady, who had no wish to ruin the poor fellow, put up with the loss, said nothing about the matter, and some time afterwards entirely lost sight of the man, on his removal to another part of the palace. At length, six years after the ccurrence just related, he went to her one day, with joyous countenance and in the most cheerful mood, and count- ed out upon the table the five hundred rubles which he had lost by his carelessness. On her inquiring how he had raised such a sum, he told her he had denied himself every indulgence, and saved so much of his monthly wages, till he had at last scraped together three hundred rubles. As -he had lately obtained a better situation, and higher wages, he had found himself in a condition to marry-his wife had brought him one hundred rubles and other little valuables. He had persuaded her ,to give up these articles, and disposed of them among his comrades; and the iproduce of these made up the sum, which he now repaid, as a debt which had weighed heavily upon his mind for six yeara As the honest fellow was not to be persuaded to take back his money, the English lady, whose head and heart were likewise in the right place, put the money out to interest, and made it her gift ,to their first child.

Nelson's Heart.-Human nature is very frail No man ever had a stronger sense of it, under the influence of a sense of justice, than Lord Nelson. He was loth to inflict punishment, and when he was obliged, as he called it, " to endure the torture of seeing men flogged," he came out of his cabin with a hurried step, ran into the gangway, made his bow to the officers, and, reading the articles of war which the culprit had infringed, said, "Boatswain, do your duty." The lash was instantly applied, and consequently the sufferer exclaimed, " forgive me, admiral, forgive me." On such an occasion, Lord Nelson would look round with wild anxiety, and as all his officers kept silence, he would say, "What! none of you speak for him Avast, cast him off!"And then added to the culprit, "Jack, in the day of battle, remember me;" he became a good fellow in future. A poor man was about to be flogged-a landsman -and few pitied him. His offence was drunkenness. As he was being tied up, a lovely girl, contrary to all rules, rushed through the officers, and, falling on her knees, clasped Nelson's hand in which were the articles of war, ex- claiming, "Pray forgive him, your honor, and he shall never offend again." "Your face," said Nelson, "is a security for his good beha- vior. Let him go; the fellow cannot be bad who has such a lovely creature in his care." This man rose to'be lieutennant; his name was William Pye.  TEX AS COURTSHIP. "Hullo, gal, how's your Ma l" "Hain't got none here-reckon she's dead by this time."

He was in his first comfortable snooze, when a clicking noise in the direction of the door awoke him. He listened intently for a moment-the noise was still going on--very like the raps of the spirits on the table, indeed. "Who's there?" There was no answer, and the queer noise stopped. "Anybody there!" No answer. "It must have been a spirit," he said to himself. "I must be a medium. I will try." (Aloud) "If there is a spirit in the room it will signify the same by saying aye-no, that's not what I mean. If there is a spirit in the room it will please rap three times." Three very distinct raps were given in the direction of the bureau. "Is it the spirit of my sister 8" No answer. "Is it the spirit of my mother!" Three raps. "Are you happy!" Nine raps. "Do you want anything 8" A succession of very loud raps. "Will you give me any communication if I will get up." No answer. "Shall I hear from you to-morrow?" Raps very loud again in the direction of the door. "Shall I ever see you l" The raps then came from the outside of the door. He waited long for an answer to his last question, but none came. The spirit had gone; and after thinking about the extraordinary visit he turned over and fell asleep.

Among others he cherished one against the Reverend Robert Montgomery, the author of Satan, f&amp;e., &amp;c. In a work he edited, he had most ruthlessly attacked the popular preacher, who was, however, somewhat of a charlatan. Although they had never seen each other, they cherished a reciprocal detestation. A mutual friend resolving to bring them together, got up a dinner party, to which the poet preacher and his savage assailant were invited. Upon entering the house with Montgomery, he was told by his servant in a low tone that Mr. Horne was in his little writing-room. He therefore very coolly took the reverend rhymster into the room where Horne was alone, and introduced them to each other under the assumed names of Jones and Brown. Begging permission to be excused while he dressed for dinner, he left the two belligerents alone. When the door closed, Mr. Horne said, "Sir, as my name is not Jones, perhaps yours is not Brown." "Certainly not," replied the divine, smiling. "I am the Rev. Robert Montgomery." "And I, sir, am Mr. Horne." They looked at each other, broke into a fit of laughter, shook hands, and when their host came down, he found the Kilkenny cats, instead of having devoured each other, up to their tails laughing at the tales they had been entertaining each other with. BEAU BRUMMEL. IN the palmy days of George, Prince of Wales, there was a club cele- brated for its fashion and exclusiveness, numbering among its members the prince, Brummel, Sheridan, &amp;c.; indeed, all were men of the first wacer in fashion, politics, or literature. A vacancy occurring, Lord Deloraine, the famous duellist, applied for admission. Suspecting that his quarrelsome propensities might militate against him, he called upon every member the morning before the ballot, and very plainly intimated that he should consider his rejection as a personal affront, and demand satisfaction from every, one severally, except the Prince of Wales, whose position as heir to the throne pro- tected him. On the night in question, Lord Deloraine went to the club, sent up his card, and requested to know if the balloting was over. As he had been blackballed, an 'answer was sent by the waiter that he had not 2  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7492-00000020"/> 26           OHT- O0H  T. been, there being unfortunately a black ball in the box. He sent the waiter up again to say that as it must be a mistake, he wished to see the chairman of the club. The Prince was about rising to comply with this outrageous request, when Brummel volunteered to satisfy the incensed duellist. Telling the waiter to show Lord Deloraine to a pri- vate room, he followed in a few minutes afterwards. Upon entering the room, he advanced in his blandest manner, and said, "My dear Deloraine, it's truly unfortunate; but you are blackballed." The other replied, "Quite a mistake. You had better try again." "No use," returned the fop, " for there was not a white ball in the ballot; but pray wait. Allow me to ring." When the waiter appeared, Brummel said, "Charles, bring me a pis- tol and coffee for two." Lord Deloraine stared in silence. When the waiter brought the articles, Beau Brummel said, "I beg your pardon, Charles, but I have forgotten a dice-box."

"No, certainly not," said Jones. "Well, did you ever hear why he was separated from his wife V" "Yes; he beat her once." "But do you know what for!" "' No; I suppose he was jealouas. "Not a bit of it. It was all about his breeches." "What-she wore them!" said I. "No; she sent them to him one day at a lecture. It happened thus: You know old Potts was dismally eccentric. He was the most absent man in all New York, especially when called upon to pay anything. Well, he thought nothing of going without his dinner or his gloves. He was a very stingy man, and never had but one suit of clothes at the same time. However, meeting his tailor one day, he gave him an order for a new pair of breeches, which were sent home unknown to the doctor's wife. Having to lecture that morning, he put his new ones on, and left the old ones on his library chair. Soon after he had gone out, Mrsl Potts entered the library; she saw the breeches, and at once concluded the doctor had gone to lecture ' sans culottes.'  Putting the breeches up in a parcel, she, to prevent the possibility of a mistake, took it herself to the lecture-room; giving the parcel to the porter, she told the man to give it to the doctor immediately. She herself then went home. The doctor was lecturing to a fashionable assembly on the wonders of chemistry, when the parcel was put into his hand. As his wife was often in the habit of sending him diagrams, &amp;c., which he left behind him, the doctor concluded, this was something connected with his lec- ture, which he had forgotten. He therefore opened it before the audi- ence, and to his astonishment and indignation, displayed to them all his cast off inexpressibles. The roar of laughter which followed, compelled him to conclude his lecture immediately. Rushing out, he went home and beat his wife.

I did not intend it when I began the letter. They came into my mind as the only women in the world worthy of being compared with those of France. I shall not presume to determine whether in the important article of beauty, form and color are to be preferred to expression and grace, or whether expression and grace are to be con- sidered preferable to complexion and shape. I shall not examine whether the piquant of France is to be thought superior to the touchant of America; or whether deep sensibility deserves to be preferred to animation and wit. So important a subject requires a volume. I shall only venture to give a trait. If a goddess could be supposed to be formed, compounded of Juno and Minerva, that goddess would be the emblem of the women of America. Venus, as she is, with all her amia- bleness and imperfections, may stand justly enough for an emblem of French women. I have decided' the question without intending it, for I have given the perfections to the women of England. One point I had ' forgotten, and it is a material one. It is not to be disputed on, for what I am going to write is the opinion and sentiment of the universe.

Having got the box, he gave a certain number of taps on the lid, and went through the other forms of snuff-taking, in imitation of what he observed the elder do, saying, as he went on: "That is what you did, sir, and what is more, you (taking a pinch) did that, too." A LETTER OF YELLOW PIGS. AN ingenious gentleman, who had the marvellous gift of shaping a great many things out of an orange peel, was displaying his abilities at a dinner-party before Theodore Hook and Mr. Thomas Hill, and suc- ceeded in counterfeiting a pig to the admiration of the company. Mr.  Hill tried the same feat; and after destroying and strewing the table with the peel of a dozen oranges, gave it up with the exclamation, "Hang the pig! I can't make him." "Nay, Hill," exclaimed Hook, glancing at the mess on the table, "you have done more; instead of one pig, you have made a litter." ROWLAND HLL was always annoyed when there happened to be any noise in the chapel, or when anything happened to divert the attention of his hearers from what he was saying. On one occasion, a few days before his death, he was preaching to one of the most crowded congre- gations that ever assembled to hear him. In the middle of his discourse he observed a commotion in the gallery.

One of his brethren, observing it, inquired of him what had induced him to make the change.

St. Just lived in a small lodging in the Rue St. Anne, not far from the house of the joiner Duplay, where Robespierre resided. Talk- ing over the events of the day and what was threatened for the mor- row, the two friends reached the door of the house.

"Do you not know that this. night will probably be the last for thousands of our fellow-creatures, who are men at the moment you go to sleep, and will be corpses when you wake?" St. Just answered with one of the common-places of the day, and went to sleep. Early the next morning, when he woke, he saw Robes- pierre pacing up and down the room, and every now and then pressing his face close to the window, to watch the daybreak, and listen to the sounds of the street. St. Just asked him what had brought him back so early, and found to his astonishment that he had not left the spot all night. "Sleep!" said Robespierre; "what while hundreds of assassins were cutting the throats of thousands of victims, and while blood, whether pure or impure, was running like water in the gutter. O, no," he continued, in a deep voice, and with a sarcastic smile on his lips, "I have not been to bed, but have watched, like remorse of crime; ay, I have been guilty of the weakness of not sleeping; but Danton, he has slept" " A Fight for a Kiss.-"Ah, Sally, give me a kiss and be done with it."

His most often quoted repartee has been so mutilated by various retailers, that we think it our duty to state it as it really happened. After his quarrel with the Prince of Wales, he was walking with the Marquis of Salisbury, when they met the Prince, who was attended by several of their mutual acquaintance. The Prince, in order to mortify, the beau, stopped to converse with the Marquis, not taking any notice of Brummel, except by a stare. Brummel, who had hold of Salisbury's arm, slowly raised his glass to his eye, and taking advantage of a pause in the conversation, deliberately drawled out, "Salisbury, who is our fat friend!" The Prince, who was as touchy on the point of his corpulency as Byron himself, hurried off to conceal his chagrin. Upon one occasion having a slight misunderstanding with the Prince,  who was then in hostility to the king, his father, Brummel threatened "to cut the Prince, and bring the old chap into fashion." There is so much doubt of the truth of the anecdote of his telling the Prince "to ring the bell," that we do not relate it, for it is not a good story, being one of those which are not good enough to be true. Nor is there much fun in his asking with a smile of contempt of a nobleman, who called attention to a garment, "Do you call that thing a coat 8" When stopped by two highwaymen on Hounslow Heath, he merely said that "if they insisted upon taking his life, he requested as a per- sonal favor that they would not disarrange his cravat."

Meeting his wife one evening at a ball, she said, "Well, George, is not it near time to go home-when did you order our carriage!"

OHT-OHAT.             41 A GENTLEMAN was promenading a fashionable street with a bright little boy at his side, when the little fellow called out, "Oh, pa, there goes an editor " "Hush, son," said the father, "don't make fun of the poor man-God only knows what you may come to yet."  SCENE in the Kitchen.-A woman making bread. Enter little boy. Little Boy.-"Mother, it strikes me you are very lazy just now." Indignant Mother.--"How dare you say so B why, don't you see I'm making bread " " Little Boy.--"True, but that's neither more nor less than loafing." [The juvenile punster got no hot cakes for several days thereafter. The mother is slowly recovering.] NAVAL TACTICS A CAPTAIN of the royal navy, one of the old school, being at a ball at Portsmouth, had been accepted by a beautiful partner, a lady of rank, who, in the most delicate manner possible, hinted to him the propriety of putting on a pair of gloves. "Oh!" was the elegant reply; "never mind me, ma'am: I shall wash mny hands when I've done dancing." CROOKED WORDS.-A poor man, who had a termagant wife, after a long dispute, in which she was resolved to have the lastword, told her, "If she spoke one more crooked word, he'd beat her brains out." "Why then, ram's-horn, you rogue," said she, " if I die for it." A GENTLEMAN making a morning call upon a very stingy, but rich old widow, was asked by her in desultory conversation, pour passer le temps- "Do you draw, Mr. Larkins 8" "Oh, in my way I do," replied that gentleman. "I should really like to see a specimen," said the widow. "Well," replied the amateur, "just order a bottle of claret, and rll see what I can do at a cork, and you may as well tell John to bring up a biscuit, for it's about lunch-time I fancy." The widow did as requested, and gave John orders for a perpetual "not at home," to Mr. Larkins's morning calls for the future.  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7492-00000028"/> ^42          Ot IT-O HATi. PUlMONARY PaAErCE-Curran's ruling passion was a joke. In his last illness, his physician observing in the morning that he seemed to cough with more difficulty, he answered, "That is rather surprising, as I have been practising all night." Old Maids.--I love an old maid-I do not speak of an individual but of the species; I use the singular number, as speaking of a singu- larity in humanity. An old maid is not merely an antiquarian, she is an antiquity; not merely a record of the past, but the very past itself; she has escaped a great change, and sympathizes not in the ordinary mutations of mortality. She inhabits a little mortality of her own. She is Miss from-the beginning of the chapter to the end. I do not like to hear her called -Mistress, as is sometimes the practice, for that looks and sounds like-resignation of despair-a voluntary extinction of hope. I do not know whether marriages are made in heaven; some people say they are, but I am almost sure old maids are. There is  something about them which is not of the earth, earthy. They aDe spectators of the world, not adventurers or ramblers-perhaps guar- dians,-we say nothing of tattlers. They are evidently predestinated to be what they are. They owe not the singularity of their condition to any lack of beauty, wisdom, wit, or good temper: there is no ac- counting for it but on the principle of fatality. I have known many old maids,: and of them all not one that has not possessed as many good and amiable qualities as ninety and nine out of a hundred of my mar- ried acquaintances. Why, then, are they single? It is their'fate. An Heroic Nurse.-A servant-maid, at Munich, signalized herself by her admirable presence of mind. She was in a garden, with a child of nine months old, and had set it down on the ground, when suddenly an eagle darted from the air to seize upon it as a prey. This young wo- man, who was fortunately close by, with extraordinary courage and presence of mind, threw a shawl at the bird, which covering his eyes, not only prevented him from seizing the infant, but even from escaping;  she boldly caught hold of the robber, and, in spite of his struggles, held him fast, till some persons came to her assistance. The king amply rewarded the heroine, who received some wounds in the contest, and sent the prisoner to the menagerie at Nymphenberg.

Truth.-To have no concern for the truth, to be false and fallacious, s a character which no person who is not utterly abandoned would 3hoose to bear; it is a character from which we expect nothing but evity and inconsistency. Truth seems to be considered by all mankind Is something fixed, unchangeable, and eternal. IT is related of George IV., when Prince of Wales, that he was once observed to bow to every one in the street who saluted him, till he 3ame to the man who swept the crossing, whom he passed without lotice. The question whether he was right in making this exception las been gravely discussed by one of these lawgivers, who finally de- 3ides in the prince's favor:-"To salute a beggar without giving him anything would be a mockery, and to stop for the purpose of bestowing sixpence would wear the semblance of ostentation in a prince." The Qualification of a Wife.-The ancient historian of Brittany Icquaints us with the opinions of John, surnamed the Good and Wise, as ;o the qualifications of a wife. On inquiring from the ambassadors, mmediately after the return from Scotland, their opinion regarding the ady, he received for answer that she was beautiful, elegantly formed, md in the bloom and vigor of health, but so remarkably silent-not so nuch, as it appeared to them, from discretion as from extreme simpli- city. "Dear friends," said John, " return speedily, and bring her to me; ihe is the very woman I have long been in search of. By St. Nicholas 1 a wife seems to my mind sufficiently acute if she can tell the difference between her husband's shirt and his shirt-ruffles." Female Society.-By all means mix as often as you can with re- ined society. A dignified social intercourse with intelligent female soeiety has a happy effect upon the character. It tends to soften down asperities, promote cheerfulness, refine the feelings, and to save a young nan from vicious company. It should be more reserved than we gene- rally allow with our own sex, but never more trifling.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7492-00000029"/> OHT-OHAT. Rum and Water.-A. certain Scotchman, not a member of any temperance society, being asked by a dealer to purchase some fine old Jamaica, drily answered, "To tell you the truth, Mr. - , I canna say I'm very fonal of rum; for if I tak mare than six tum'lers, it's very apt to gi'e me a headache." A Light-Headed Lady.-A lady of rank, dancing one evening, approached so near to a chandelier that the fluttering plume of feathers waving to and fro on her forehead came in contact with the flame, and the whole was instantly in a blaze. The illimination, however, was quickly and happily extinguished without harm; when her husband, seeing the danger avoided, and the thoughtlessness of the act that urged it, peevishy and half-angrily exclaimed, "Surely your ladyship must be absolutely mad " "No, no," replied her ladyship, " only a little light-headed."  Foresight.-,A mother said one dayto her daughter, "When you are of my age, you will be dreaming of a husband." "Yes, mamma," replied the young lady, "for the second time." Accent Right.-"Ah, my good fellow, where have you been for a week back!" "For a weak back I I have not been troubled, I thank you." "No, no: where have you been long back?" "Long back l Don't call me long back, you scoundrel 1" "All Flesh   is Grass."-Bishop  Hughes, in a sermon to his parishioners, repeated the quotation that "all flesh is grass."  The Season was Lent, and a few days after he encountered Terrence O'Cul- lins, who appeared to have something on his mind. "The top of the mornin' to your riverence,"  said Terrence. "Did I fairly understand your riverence to say that 'all flesh is grass,' last Sundayl" "To be sure you did," replied the Bishop, "and you are a heretic if you doubt." "Oh! not the bit did I doubt anything your riverence says," said the wily Terrence; "but if your riverence plazes, I wish to know whether in this Lent time I could not be after having a small piece of pork by way of a salad."   OHT  HOHAT.           45 A PORLfE young lady recently asserted that she had lived near a barn-yard, and that it was impossible for her to sleep in the morning- on account of the outcry made by a gentleman hen.

Western  Etiquette.-The Yankee traveller who saw the live Hoosier, has again written to his mother, giving his experience as follows. Western people are death on etiquette. You can't tell a man he lies, here, without fighting. A few days ago a man was Itelling a pretty large story, in my hearing. Says I, "Stranger, that's a whopper." Says he, "Lay there, stranger." And in less than no time I found myself sprawling in the ditch. At another time, says I to a man I never see afore, as a woman passed- "That isn't a specimen of your Western women is it t" Says he, "You're afeard of the fever and ager, stranger, ain't you." "Very much," says I. "Well," says he, " that was my wife, and if you don't apologize in two minutes, by the honor of a gentleman I swear to you that these two pistols shall cure you of the disorder entirely. So don't fear, stranger." So I politely apologized. I admire the Western country very much, but darn me if I can stand so much etiquette; it always takes me unawares. SOME girls, in kissing, purse up their mouths as if they were about to perform on the flageolet. This is wrong.

Paddy, never at a loss for an expedient, thrust the poker into the fire, and soon made it red-hot; then, seating himself astride the barrel, he commenced to burn his way to the coveted " potteine." The story goes that the barrel contained gunpowder, and that Paddy and his companion took an astonishing flight upwards, and were never seen afterwards.  Dodging the Responsibility.--"Sir," said Fieryfaces, the lawyer, to an unwilling witness, "Sir, do you say upon your oath, that Blimp- kins is a dishonest man " . "I did not say anybody had ever accused him of being an honest man, did I?" replied Pipkins. "Does the Court understand you to say, witness, that the plaintiff's reputation is bad?" said the Judge, merely putting the question to keep his eyes open. "I didn't say it was good, I reckon." "Sir!" cried Fieryfaces, "Sir-rl upon your oath-mind, upon your oath-you say that Blimpkins is a rogue, a thief, and a villain." ,( You say so," was Pipkins' answer. "Hav'n't you said so!" inquired the lawyer. "Why, you've said it, and what's the use of myrepeating it?" replied Pipkins. "Sir-r," thundered Fieryfaces, the Demosthenean thunderer of Thumbtown, "Sir, I charge you upon your sworn oath, do you or do you not say Blimpkins stole things " "No, sir," was the cautious reply of Pipkins, "I never said Blimpkins stole things, but I do say he's got a way of finding things that nobody has lost!" "Sir, you can retire," said Fieryfaces; and the Court adjourned. Anecdote of Charles Lamb.-Lamb was once invited by an old friend to meet an author who had just published a volume of poems.

Elia that it possessed very little merit, being a feeble echo of different authors. This opinion of the poetaster was fully confirmed by the ap- pearance of the gentleman himself, whose self-conceit and confidence in his own book were so manifest as to awaken in Lamb that spirit of mis- chievous waggery so characteristic of the humorist. Tlamb's rapid and tenacious memory enabled him during the dinner to quote fluently several passages from the pretender's volume. These he gave with this introduction-"This reminds me of some verses I wrote when I was very young." He then, to the astonishment of the gentleman in ques- tion, quoted something from the volume. Lamb tried this a second time; the gentleman looked still more surprised, and seemed evidently bursting with suppressed indignation. At last, as a climax to the fun, TLmb coolly quoted the well-known opening lines of "Paradise Lost," as written by himself ' This was too much for the versemonger. He immediately rose to his legs, and, with an impressive solemnity of man- ner, thus addressed the claimant to so many poetical honors--"Sir, I have tamely submitted all this evening to hear you claim the merit that may belong to any little poems of my own: this I have borne in silence; but, sir, I never will sit quietly by, and see the immortal Milton robbed of 'Paradise Lost."' Captain Kidd's Vision.-Lord Byron used to mention a strange story which the commnander of a packet related to him. This officer stated that, being asleep one night in his berth, he was awakened by the pressure of something heavy on his limbs; and, there teing a faint light in the room, could see, as he thought, distinctly the figure of his brother, who was at that time in the same service in the East Indies, dressed in his uniform, and stretched across the bed. Concluding it to be an illusion of the senses, he shut his eyes, and made an effort to sleep. But still the same pressure continued; and still, as often as he ventured to take another look, he saw the figure lying across in the same position. To add to the wonder, on putting his hand forth to touch the figure, he found the uniform in which it appeared to be dressed dripping wet I On the-entrance of one of his brother-officers, to whom he called out in alarm, the apparition vanished; but, in a few months after, Captain Kidd received the startling intelligence that on that night his brother had been drowned in the Indian seas. Of the supernatural character of this appearance, Captain Kidd himself did not appear to have the slightest doubt.

"Well," said Jake, drawing a long breath, " ef I must I must, for I deu love yeu, Sal;" and so Jake commenced sidling up to her, like a male porker going to battle. Laying his arm gently upon Sal's shoulder, she was heard to exclaim- "That's the way teu deu it, old hoss-thats acting like a white man orter." "Oh!

We are all finite creatures!"

It is stated that his dispatch, announcing the victory, was written to rival the celebrated  I   a H T-H   T a .          51 dispatch of Clesar, "Veni, vidi, vici," and consisted of one word, and that "Peccavi"--"I have sinned" (Scinde). Almost, or quite as good a one, is fathered upon Sheridan, who must groan in his grave under the loads of such faceting that are piled on him. He was going with a friend to church, and found, what many have found since, a row of inhospitable pews, but none open to receive him. He was a little embarrassed at standing in the aisle with his friend behind him, and bolted at an empty pew, but the door was locked. "Why don't you go in!" whispered -his friend over his shoulder. "Pudor vetat," said Sheridan in reply, as he strode out of the church. A DARK-COLORED man once went to Portland, Maine, and attended church.

Effects of Superstition.-The following   anecdote of Alexander Smith, one of the finest of the young British Poets, is a striking evi- dence of the mischievous results of all ultra doctrines  How many a young mind has been weaned from   religion by the pertinacity with which his parents compelled him to attend church, without reference to his feelings. Indeed, divine worship is so great a privilege that it ought not to be forced upon the young, till they are made sufficiently aware of its elevated character. While yet a very little boy, working in a factory, he, being brought up in "( the straitest sect of our religion," was stricken with something he had learned from  tract or sermon, to the effect that every act or feeling was valueless, nay, sinful, if it had not for its sole object " the glory of God," or if it was accompanied by personal satisfaction.

"What!" you ask, " had he killed a cat, or stolen a marble, or pummelled a playmate!"Not at all: the little peni- tent bore an excellent character among his elders, but he could not dis. cover that he did all things for the glory of God, and he could not resist a sense of pleasure in the performance of a benevolent action. "Miserable wretch," moaned the childish conscience, "there is no good in you; you can't so much as give a penny to a beggar without feeling pleased to see him look happy." A desperate resolution seized him. He would daily do some good thing, and try with his whole might and feel no  satisfaction in it. Perhaps at last he might be so blessed as to succeed. An expedient occurs to him. Working all day in the factory at a dis- tance from home, he is allowed one penny per diem with which to purchase a cake at noon, It is the only cash that ever reaches him. He will forego the cake and give the daily penny away exclusively for the glory of God. Firm in his resolve, he issues into the streets fasting,  and with his penny in hand. A wounded sailor approaches; the child feels his heart ready to dance with anticipated pleasure at the coming gift; he strives by a strong effort to feel unhappy, and sturdily says over and over to himself, "The glory of God." The sailor is here; the child thrusts the penny into his hand, but in the excitement looks up, sees the beggar's look of thanks, feels his little bosom overflow with ir- resistible joy, and runs back sobbing with humiliation and misery. Has he not lost both his penny and his virtue? Shall he not starve to-day for nothing-nay, for worse than nothing? Day by day, week after week, the same struggle continued with varying success, till happily his pale face and emaciated look led to stringent inquiries as to the nature and amount of his food, and the sacrifice was stayed, though the cause of it was never discovered.  ENGLISH AND IRISH SAILORS.-Two sailors, one Irish and the other English, agreed reciprocally to take care of each other, in case of either  being wounded in an action about to commence. It was not long before  the Englishman's leg was shot off by a cannon-ball; and, on his calling to Paddy to carry him to the doctor, according to their agreement, the  other very readily complied; but he had scarcely got his wounded corn- panion on his back when a second ball struck off the poor fellow's head.  Paddy, who, through the noise and disturbance common in asea engage-  ment, had not perceived his friend's last misfortune, continued to make Il   OHT-OH1AT*             68 the best of his way to the surgeon. An officer observing him with a headless trunk upon his shoulders, asked where he was going. "To the doctor," says Paddy. "The doctor!" says the officer; "why, you blockhead, the man has lost his head."  On hearing this, he flung the body from his shoulders, and, looking at it very attentively: "By my soul," says he, " he lold me it was his leg." A STRONG OPINION AGAINST PROOF.-A person meeting with an ac- quaintance after a long absence, told him that herwas surprised to see him, for he had heard that he was dead. "But," says the other, "you find the report false." "'Tis hard to determine," he replies, "for the man that told me was one whose word I would sooner take than yours." A LAME SAmoB.-"As you do not belong to my parish," said a clergyman to a begging sailor, with a wooden leg, "you cannot expect that I should relieve you." "Sir," said the sailor, with a noble air, "I lost my leg fighting for all parishes." HABrr.-"I trust everything, under God," said Lord Brougham, "to habit, upon which, in all ages, the lawgiver as well as the schoolmaster has mainly placed his reliance; habit, which makes everything easy, and casts all difficulties upon a deviation from a wonted course. Make sobriety a habit, and intemperance will be hateful; make prudence a habit, and reckless profligacy will be as contrary to the child, grown or adult, as the most atrocious crimes are to any of your lordships. Give a child the habit of sacredly regarding truth; of carefully respecting the property of others; of scrupulously abstaining from all acts of im- providence which involve him in distress, and he will be just as likelyto think of rushing into an element in which he cannot breathe, as of lying, or cheating, or stealing." Hamlet and Guilderstein.-Macready's arrogance is well known to all who have had any dealings with him. Neafie tells a capital story, in which an actor carried his obedience to the great dramatic bully to a retributive extent. Hackett, the manager of the Astor House Opera-house-where Macready performed his last American  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7492-00000034"/> 4o a HT-OHAT. engagement-had requested the company, that what the great Mr. Macready told them to do, they were to follow his instructions im- plicitly. A simple-minded actor, of the name of Wemyss, performed the part of Guilderstein, and thus carried out the tragedian's commands. IAMLET.--I prithee, sir, play on this pipe.

GUILDERSTEIN.-- Well; since you insist upon it, I will do my best, though I am but a poor hand at the flageolet. Then, to the utter dismay of Macready, and the merriment, of the audience, Wemyss played "Yankee -Doodle," and was going to give them "Bobbing Around," when Macready wrested the pipe from Guilderstein's mouth, and glared like a tiger. A Delicate Insinuation,-Delapierre, the courteous attendant at Barnum's Museum, has a pleasant wit, which he now and then exercises very agreeably. A sub-editor of the New York press, rather famous for his supercilious manner, was leaving the Museum the other day, when Delapierre, whom he had treated very rudely on several occa- sions, went up to him and said, in a very mild tone, "Pardon me, sir, I cannot let you go till I have counted the monkeys."

Paov;ass are as different as light from shade; for while some are full of wisdom, others are either the dulness of pomposity, or the essence of commonplace. Nothing is more dreary than a large col- lection. The next point of interest is the characteristic which every nation possesses. Browning asserts that he could detect the birth- place of every proverb, as easily as that of a man. We doubt this as a general rule. Although there are certainly many which "smell of their country," still we think they rather "smell of the lamp," or, in other words, of human experience condensed into the most epigrammatic form. We give a few, exemplifying the different phases of life. What can be more prudent than "Advice to all, security for none." We can well fancy this the production of some John Jacob Astor of the olden time when the Jews were shepherds and kings, and not pawnbrokers. How coldly cautious is, "Affairs, like salt fish, ought to be a good while soaking," and how terribly true is the celebrated maxim of Rochefou- cauld, "There is something in the misfortunes of our best friends not altogether displeasing to us." Surely this is a bold exposure of the envy of the human heart. Never was truth hit off better than by the Spanish proverb of "A grand eloquence has always a little conscience." A glance at all the greatest orators of the world proves this con- clusively, from Demosthenes, Eschines, Cicero, down to the days of Sheridan, Fox, and to that most insufferable egotist, Kossuth. Surely Wall-street merchants should engrave over their stores this whisper of the uncertainty of riches, "A merchant's happiness hangs upon chance, winds, waves, and wars;" and the subserviency of man is equally well put forth in--"A very little wit will save a fortunate man." Pierce Pungent remembers dining at the Napoleon Hotel, one day, where at the table sat a landed proprietor and a well known author. There also was present the editor of the little village paper, who seemed to hang upon the lips of the wealthy Logan, as though he scattered pearls. Indeed, so far did this New Jersey scribe carry his admiration of his Solomon, that he actually cried " hush " if he saw any- body else going to open his mouth, even though it were to put into it a bit of potato. The Spaniards were very severe upon some of their trades. Witness their saying, "A hundred tailors, a hundred millers, and a hundred weavers, are three hundred thieves." Pierce Pungent is afraid that every   CHT-OHAT.              57 trade, profession, or calling, has a spice of roguery in it; for without charging a profit, which is cheating, commerce could not exist. Indeed, if a merchant were to charge too little, he cheats that dearly beloved person himself; so, as the lesser evil, he cheats his neighbor. By the way, how delicately the Spanish proverb touches that sore spot in human nature, its sycophancy, when it boldly asserts that, "An ass covered with gold is more respectable than a horse with a pack- saddle." Carlyle often quotes the proverb of, "'A wonder lasts but nine days, and then the puppy's eyes are open," as a model of profundity, as all wonder is the effect of ignorance. "Beware of vinegar made of sweet wine," is a sound bit of advice; for nothing is so enduring and malignant as the hatred of a woman who has once loved you. We really think that a man might easily go through the world with safety, if he were to select about a dozen pro- verbs, and act up to them consistently. We have remarked that proverbs are seldom complimentary to the fair sex, plainly proving they have been written by crusty old bachelors, or worn-out debauchees. What could have induced any other to say, "A mill, a clock, and a woman, always want mending," or "A widow should be either married, buried, or shut up in a convent." And what would our American ladies say to this, "A woman is to be trusted out of her house but three times in her life-when she is christened, married, and buried." The following are also not very favorable to our fair readers, and we quote them to advise the ladies not to put their faith in princes or proverbs: "Advise no one to go to the wars, or marry." "A good occasion for courtship is when the widow returns from the funeral." "Commend a wedded life, but keep thyself single." What will the women say at the Italian cynic, who put a woman down as of less value than a farthing, which is implied by his saying- "He that loseth his wife and a farthing, has a great loss in his farthitng." The author of the saying that "He who marries a widow will often have a dead man's head thrown into his dish," had an experience no doubt to found it on. It is much akin to that of, "Never marry a widow, unless her husband has been hanged," but, aoording to the fol- lowing verses, even this is not altogether safe. 8*  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7492-00000036"/> 58           OHT-0HAT. "Widows, like two-edged swords, are dangerous things, And lead men by the nose as pigs with rings. Their chief delight is digging up the first, 'The best of men,' to prove 'you are the worst.'

A YANKEE has taken out a patent for leather tanned with the bark of a dog. As the coach was about to leave a village inn, a modest limb of the law approached the landlady, a pretty quakeress, who was near the fire, and said he could not think of going without giving her a kiss. "Friend, thee must not do it," said she. "Oh, by heavens, I will!" replied the young lawyer. "Well, friend, as thou hast sworn, thee may do it, but thee must not make a practice of it." A MAN FOR ALL OCCAsIONS.-Captain Wilson, of the steamer Illinois, on the Upper Lakes, is proverbially a man for all occasions, and is always equally at home in a horse-race or a dance. During a recent excursion of his beautiful boat to Lake Superior, he happened to arrive at a place on Sunday where several tribes of Indians were assembled to receive their annuity from the general government, and where a large number were already present. As soon as the breakfast table was cleared, Captain W. commenced arrangements for religious services in the ladies' cabin,-   CHT-CHAT.              59 agreeably to the request of a preacher on board. Chairs and sofas were placed across the hall, and the piano, with a large Bible on it, re- presented a pulpit. The large bell of the boat was tolled, and in a short time quite a respectable congregation occupied the seats. As soon as service had fairly begun, the captain came upon the forward deck, where a number of gentlemen were enjoying their cigars and meerschaums, and thus addressed them: "I come to let you know that meetin' is now going on in the aft cabin, where all of you in need of prayers, and who wish to hear a good ser- mon, had better retire. I would also state, that in accordance with the desire of several passengers, I intend to get up an Indian foot-race on shore for a barrel of flour. You can make your own selection of the two amusements." The foot-race did come off, and it was fortunate that all the lady pas- sengers were at "meetin'," as one of the Indians, who started with nothing on him but a calico shirt, came in minus that! iHe won the flour, however. THE following anecdote is said to be " founded." It is certainly too good to be lost: A few miles below Poughkeepsie there lived some years ago, if he does not now live there, a very worthy clergyman, but very short in stature. On a certain Sunday, about eight years ago, this clergyman was invited by the pastor of a church in that village to " fill his pulpit" for the day. The invitation was accepted: and Sunday morning saw Mr. -- in the pulpit. Now it happened that the pulpit was a very high one, and accor- dingly nearly hid the poor clergyman from view. However, the con- gregation managed to keep their countenances, and seemed religiously anxious for the text. They were not obliged to wait long; for a nose and two little eyes suddenly appeared over the top of the pulpit, and a small piping voice proclaimed in nasal tones the text: "Be of good cheer: It is II Be not afraid 1" A general smile pervaded the whole, church at this announcement; and the clergyman himself became confused, and "turned all sorts of colors." It was a long time before he could proceed with his sermon, so abruptly broken off. ,      &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7492-00000037"/> 60          COHT-OHAT. The Dra  .-The  e-  is a good theatre, probably the finest in the country. The boxes are commodious and elegant, the parquette neat, and adapted for a good view of the stage, while in the dress circle and upper tiers one is sure to get the worth of his money. The gentle- men attached to the doors, and the box-keepers, are very gentlemanly. They always let Jonathan in for nothing, and find him a seat, even if they turn somebody else out I That Jonathan calls very handsome. Jonathan lately went to the    to see Miss Charlotte Cush- man. The play was "Guy Mannering." In the first act there was a dialogue between a shop-keeper in the hardware line and Mr. Manner- ing. There was an old widow in the scene, a wonder of a widow, who remembered her husband, who had been dead for sixteen years. There was also a handsome young lady in black, Miss Bertram, and her old schoolmaster, who knew all the foreign languages in the world, but only enough of the English to say "Prodigious." And there was a drunken lawyer whose neck and legs were like those of a sick crane, and he offered Miss Bertram his hand and fortune, but she refused him; and he grew very angry, and was going to strike her, or kiss her, or something of the sort, when up came Mr. Mannering, who rolled up his shirt sleeves, and told the drunken lawyer to slope, or he'd make him. And the lawyer sneaked off, vowing vengeance, and so ended that act. In the second act there was a couple of travellers lost in the woods, Mr. Brown, of the Fusiliers, and Dandie Dinmont, of the Bruisers, a kind of old-country Tom Hyer. Dandie had on a great many coats, and saw trwo lights where Mr. Brown only saw one. In the next scene was a lot of gipsies lying on the ground. In came the two travellers, and the gipsies wouldn't help them find the way home, so Dandie was about to introduce one of them to the middle of next week; but he didn't, but ordered supper, which was brought him. At that moment Jonathan heard a terrible racket, a clapping of hands, and stamping of feet, in all parts of the house. He looked up on the stage, and there stood an old woman, leaning on a stick in the strangest way in the world. And the more noise the folks in front made, the more the old woman didn't notice 'em, and the more she did notice Mr. Brown. But Mr. Brown didn't seem to hear the noise, and didn't seem to see the gipsy, though she was quite near him, and staring at him like sin. In three or four minutes the old woman shifted her position, and then Mr. Brown saw her, but wasn't a bit frightened. And then she sang a song for him, a lullaby which she used to sing over his cradle when he was a baby.   OHT-OHAT.              61 Who on airth is that old woman?" said Jonathan. "She an't no actress, she an't. Why do they let crazy folks come on the stage in that way? It's some old crazy woman. Look at her now I She wants to tell Mr. Brown's fortune. Don't you let her, old feller, she can't do it a bit. Look at her now. She's going to cry over Captain Brown; she must be his mother; poor cretur I vow, I shall cry too." And cry Jonathan did all the rest of that scene, and all the rest of the evening he was so wrapped up in the old woman that he couldn't remember the rest of the play. And who do you think the old woman was? Jonathan was never so sucked in all the days of his life, for what do you think? That old woman was Miss Cushman herself, play- ing "Meg Merrilies!" A WrrIER in Harper's Magazine for the current month, seems to find his Dutch blood dancing to a new tune in the delight he experiences at a discovery, in recent researches into American literature, concerning the much-disputed origin of Yankee Doodle. Of course we cannot find it in our hearts to criticise the song in use among the Dutch laborers, "which trolls out thus:" "tanker didel, doodel down, Didel, dudel, lanter, Yanke viver voover vown Botermilk thd Tanther." BARGAIN hunters generally get bit. Mrs. Squeeze walked a mile the other day to save sixpence on that sweetmeat sugar. She effected her purchase, but we can't see that she made much by it. What she bought for nice St. Croix, proved to be nothing but New Orleans, made lively with saw-dust. Such sugar is very good to look at, but, as Mrs. Harit observes, " it don't sweeten." IN North Carolina, it is frequent, among her forests of fat pine, for a lover in distress to send the fair object of his affections a bit of its staple vegetable production, with an eye painted upon it. This signi- fies, "I pine." If favorable to him, the young lady selects from the wood pile the best and smoothest specimen of a knot-this signifies, "pine not." But if, on the other hand, she detests him (there is no middle ground between detestation and adoration, with young women), she burns one end of his message, and this generally throws the young man into despair, for it means, "I make light of your 'pining."'  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7492-00000038"/> 62            H IIT- CHAT. Dancing Furniture.-Sir Walter Scott relates a story of a rich libertine who, whenever he was alone in his drawing-room, was so haunted by a spectral corps de ballet that the very furniture was, as it were, converted into phantoms. To relieve himself from this unwelcome intrusion, he retired to his country-house, and here for a while obtained the quiet which- he sought. But it chanced that the furniture of his town-house was sent to him in the country; and on the instant that his eyes fell-on the drawing-room chairs and tables, the illusion came afresh on his mind. By the influence of association, the greenfigurantes came frisking and capering into his room, shouting in his unwilling ears, "Eere we are 1 here we are!" Sheridan and Lewis.-Sheridan never gave Lewis any of the pro- fits of the "Castle Spectre." One day, Lewis being in company with him, said, "Sheridan, I will make you a large bet." Sheridan, who was always ready to make a wager, however inconvenient he might find it to pay, if lost, asked eagerly, "What bet?" "All the profits of my ' Castle Spectre,"' replied Lewis. "I will tell you wLhat," said Sheridan, who never found his match at repartee, "I will make you a very small one-what it is worth." HKissing in America.-When a wild spark attempts to steal a kiss from a Nantucket girl, she says, "Come, sheer off, or I'll 'split your mainsail with a typhoon." The Boston girls hold still until they are well-kissed, when they flare-up and say, "I think you ought to be ashamed." When a young chap steals a kiss from an Alabama girl, she says, "I reckon it is my turn now," and gives him a box on the ear that he don't forget for a week. When a clever fellow steals a kiss from a Louisiana girl she smiles, blushes deeply, and says nothing. We think the girls of our village have more taste than those of down-east and Alabama. When a man is smart enough to steal the divine luxury from them, they are perfectly satisfied. When a female is here saluted with a buss, she puts on her bonnet and shawl, and answereth thus. "I am astonished at thy assurance, Jedediah; for this indignity I will sew thee up." The ladies in this village receive a salute with Christian meekness; they follow the Scripture rule-when smit on the one cheek, they turn the other also.

B IN one of the police courts of a neighboring city, lately, a fair dam- sel made her appearance before the magistrate and asked for a warrant against a lady acquaintance, whom she charged with having designs upon her life. The magistrate inquired the particulars, when he was somewhat astonished to hear the following from the lips of the appli- cant: "Why,- you see, Judge," said she nervously and confidentially, "the truth is that Mr. John Sm--th has for two years been very atten- tive to me-and-and-but no matter.

"No, ma'am: I am a living man, but I will dye for you," promptly replied Neil. If Neil was not a married man, this frank avowal might appear in a different color; but as such is the case, we presume that although he may dye for all the young ladies in town, yet he lives for " the gudewife at home." A LrrrLw boy of our acquaintance recently attended church, and after listening attentively to the parable of the wise and foolish house- builders, said to his mother on the way home, "I don't think that man was so wise after all."

"If the song-sparrow had died, or the little wren, or even the robin," replied Ada, sadly, "my heart would not have felt the pain that oppresses it; but to look upon a dead dove touches my feelings deeply." "But why should you feel more pain because a dove has died I  Its life is the same as the life of a robin, a sparrow, or a wren." "No, not the same, Henry." "Wherein lies the difference?" "Are not their bodies different f" "Oh, yes."

"I cannot believe otherwise," said Ada, as she lifted her eyes from the bird in her hand, and looked tenderly at her lover. "And this dove-to what affection does it correspond, and why are you so deeply touched by its death!" "Need you ask, Henry?

"Never shall her heart feel the pangs of neglect, never, no, never " said the lover, in earnest self-communion. May his words prove a true prophecy; and if, in after life, his heart swerve, even for an instant, from its affection, may the form of the dead dove present itself, and warn him of the ruin his infidelity would occasion.

To this the clergyman boldly asserted that the address was written by himself the week previous to its delivery, and therefore the assertion could not be correct. The next day he received a splendid copy of "Webster's Dictionary." JENINS says that the " drift" of a speaker's remarks he heard the other night, was higher than any snow bank he ever saw. Probably the speaker was " some."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7492-00000042"/> 70           Oi1IT-0HAT. JosEPr was a bad boy. He had succeeded in blinding his mother for some time as to his imbibing propensities. One night Joseph came in before the old lady had retired. He sat down, and with a look of semi-intoxicated wisdom, began conversing about the goodness of the crops and other matters. He got along very well until he espied what he supposed to be a cigar on the mantel-piece; he caught -it up, and placing one end in his mouth, began very gravely to light it at the candle. He drew and pulled until he was getting red in the face. The old lady's eyes were opened, and she addressed him: "If thee takes that tenpenny nail for a cigar, it is time thee went to bed." IF you observe a gentleman with his arm around the waist of a young lady, it is morally certain that they are not married. Goes of Liquor.-The tavern called the Queen's Head,- in Duke's- court, Bow Street, was once kept by a facetious individual of the name of Jupp. Two celebrated characters, Annesley Shay and Bob Toddington, a sporting man, met one evening at the above place, went to the bar, and asked for half-a-quartern each, with a little cold water. In course of time they drank four-and-twenty, when Shay said to the other, "Now we'll go." "Oh, no 1" replied he," we'll have another, and then go." This ' did not satisfy the Hibernians, and they continued drinking on till three in the morning, when they both agreed to GO; so that under the idea of going, they make a long stay, and this was the origin of drinking or aIling for GOEtS. TELLuIO THE BaGGEST LIE.-We received on Saturday last, says the Washington Commonwealth, the name of an individual who directed us to enter it upon our subscription list, on condition that we would -"tell a bigger lie than either of the other town papers." We have accordingly entered the name, and, in compliance with the condition, have only to say that our new subscriber is a perfect gentleman. PROMOTIO.--Two freethinking authors proposed to a bookseller that was a little decayed in the world, that, if he would print their works, they would set him up; and, indeed, they were as good as their word, for in six weeks' time he was in the pillory.      .   H I T - H T.           71 Macready's Dying-Spot.-Mr. Macready was never popular with stock actors. He annoyed them exceedingly at rehearsals by giving every man his particular place on the stage, so that in the picture presented he should be the centre. This actor must stand here. that actor there-it was his will. On one of the nights of his last engage- ment in New Orleans, when he was to play Hamlet, he was very, particular at rehearsal in the disposition of characters at the fall of the curtain. He had selected the most commanding place on the stage, well down to the lights, and declared that there he intended to die. It so happened that as the fatal moment was approaching, just after Hamlet had stabbed the king, his majesty took it into his head to die on the spot selected by the philosophic Dane. The poison was burning in Hamlet's veins; he was in the agonies of death; but still he found time to say, sotto voce, to his stepfather, "Back, back!--I'm going to die there." The blood of outraged royalty was up, and the stabbed monarch replied, "I'm king, and I'll die where I please--pick out a place for yourself!"  And Hamlet was compelled to let his soul out farther up the stage. SELF-CONVICTION.-A gentleman writing a letter to a friend at a coffee-house, perceived an impertinent fellow was looking over him as he wrote it. He, therefore, concluded his letter in these words:- "I. should say more things, which ought only to be known to our- selves, if it were not for an impudent fellow who is looking overjpe." "Upon my honor, sir," said the man, who could not refrain from speaking, " if you will believe me, I have not seen a word!" UNLUCKY NUMBERS.-Some people, even in very high quarters, it is said, have an objection to thirteen at dinner. Dr. Kitchener happened to be one of a company of that number at Dr. Henderson's: and on its being remarked and pronounced unlucky, he said, "I admit that it is unlucky in one case." "What case is that "V"When there is only dinner enough for twelve." A RIDDLE.-The following riddle is said to be the last production of Sheridan's witty pen:--"Sometimes with a head, sometimes without a head; sometimes with a tail, sometimes without a tail; sometimes with head and tail, sometimes without either; and yet equally perfect in all situations.

FraST BooK AuorN. -The first book auction in England of which we have any record is of a date as far back as 1676, when the library of Dr. Seaman was brought to the hammer. Prefixed to the catalogue is an address, which thus commences:- "Reader, it hath not been usual here in England to make sale of books by way of auction, or who will give the most for them; but it having been practised in other countries, to the advantage of both buyers and sellers, it was therefore conceived (for the encouragement of learning) to publish the sale of these books in this manner of way." A PROUD HEART.-Mathews, whose powers in conversation, and whose flow of anecdote in private life, transcended even his public efforts, told a variety of tales of the Kingswood colliers (Kingswood is -near BristoD, in one of which he represented an old collier looking for some of the implements of his trade, exclaiming,- "( Jan, what's the mother done with the new coal sacks!" "Made pillows on 'em," replied the son. "Confound her proud heart 1" rejoins the collier, " why could she not take th' ould ones!" THE VERDICT.-A notorious thief, having to be tried for his life, confessed the robbery,he was charged with. The judge hereupon directed the jury to find him guilty upon his own confession. The jury having laid their heads together, brought him in not guilty. The judge bade them consider of it again; but still they brought in their verdict not guilty. The judge asked the reason. The foreman replied, "There is reason enough, for we all know him to be one of the greatest liars in the world." AN AWKWARD MSTAKE.-A fine stone church was lately built in Missouri, upon the faCade of which a stonecutter was ordered to cut the following as an inscription:-'"My house shall be called the house of prayer." He was referred, for accuracy, to the verse of Scripture in which these wlordr occur; but, unfortunately, to the scandal of the society, he transcribed the whole verse-"My house shall be called the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves."

"I don't know what you mean by not being an Irishman," said the gentleman who was about hiring him; "but this I know, you were born in Ireland." "Och, your honor, if that's all," said the boy, " small blame to that. Suppose I had been born in a stable, would I have been a horse!" The Princess Royal of England.-George W. Kendall, in a letter to the New Orleans Picayune, giving an account of Queen Victoria's visit to Paris, says:- "I have heard a story of the Princess Royal, who accompanied her august parents on 'their recent trip here, which is by no means bad; it shows that she has a spice of mischief in her composition, and that she has a will of her own withal She is now some fourteen years of age, but appears older-is almost a woman, in fact. Our lady readers may ask if she is handsome I Not by any means. On the contrary, she is a fat, chubby, and coarse specimen of a girl-a homely likeness of her mother, who never set up any pretensions for beauty that I am aware of. Her nose, in particular, is faulty; but I am forgetting my story. When about ten years old, her mother entered her study-room, just as her tutor, whom I will call Birch, came in at an opposite door. The little princess, not aware that her anxious maternal relative was within hearing, broke out bluntly with 'How are you, Birch?' Astonished and shocked at this freedom and familiarity of her daughter, the Queen proceeded to give her a sound scolding. She told her that she must always be civil and respectful to her teachers, and to all the servants; and if she ever heard the like again coming from her mouth, she would send her straight to bed--a very severe punishment for children, and one which it would seem is fashionable in the royal palaces of England. But it appears that tie children of imperial or queenly households are no more obedient than those of common people; for on the very next morning after she was so distinctly told that she must treat her tutor with courtesy and politeness, and without in the least caring for the threat of being sent out of the way, she again, as he came into the room, broke out with' How are you, Birch 7 Good nigt : Im going to bed I' Tolerably sharp, that, for a little girl of ten, and who was the heiress apparent of the throne of England until a brood of brothers stepped in the way." 4  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7492-00000044"/> 74           aoHT-OHAT.* As we are in court now, let us relate a good one we read lately of a lawyer in Nureniberg, Germany. A young man who had no fortune came to him for advice in a matter of matrimony and a matter of money too; for, as in too many other cases, his fair one was willing, but  he feared the parents would refuse their consent. The lawyer called on the father, and proposed the match as one in all respects suitable. The father had an eye to the money, and at once asked what property the young man had. The lawyer said he did not know, but he would inquire. The next time he met him he asked him what property he was worth, and was told, none at all. "Well'," said the lawyer, " would you suffer any one to cut off your  nose if they would give you twenty thousand dollars for it " "No, not for the world."    -                 ; "All right," said the lawyer, "I had my own reason for asking.', The lawyer goes to the girl's father and says:-- "I have inquired about that young man!s circumstances. He has indeed no ready money, but he has a jewel for which, to my knowledge, he has refused twenty thousand dollars." This induced the old man to consent, and the young folks were married. But the old man always turned up his nose when he thought of the jewel and of the manner in which the cunning lawyer had taken him in. Vampires.-A German paper relates the following curious instance of the belief of the peasantry of Hungary, Croatia, Poland, and Turkey,  in vampires, who, according to the popular superstition, descend into their graves with their eyes open, and rise at dead of night to suck the blood of their victims, leaving no trace behind except a little spot on the neck or throat of their victim. A young and beautiful girl, the daughter of wealthy peasants, had numerous suitors, from among whom she selected one of her own station of life. The betrothal was celebrated by a grand feast, given by the bride's father. Towards midnight the girl and her mother retired to their chamber, leaving the guests at table. All at once the two women were heard to shriek dreadfully, and the moment after the mother, pale and haggard, tottered into the room, carrying her daughter senseless in her arms, and crying in a voice of indescribable agony, ", A vampire - a vampire I My daughter is dead!"The village doctor happened to be among the guests, and believing that the girl had only fainted, adminis-   -OH IT-OHAaT.                   l tered a cordial which speedily restored her to consciousness. On being questioned, she stated that while undressing, a pale spectre, dressed in a shroud, glided in by the window, and rushed upon, her, biting her throat. She added she recognised him as one Keysnewsky, a rejected suitor, who died a fortnight since. The doctor ia vain attempted to persuade her she was laboring under some delusion. The next day the body of Keysnewsky was disinterred, and twenty guns were fired at its skull, which being shattered to fragments, was, amidst yells and dances, burnt to ashes. The girl, however, died within the fortnight, persisting to the last that she had been bitten by a vampire, though she would not suffer the wound to be examined. After her death the doctor took off the bandages from her neck and discovered a small wound, which had the appearance of having been made by a harness-maker's awl and poisoned. The doctor then learned that one-of the poor girl's rejected suitors was a harness-maker of an adjacent village, and he did not doubt that it was he who stabbed the hapless bride. He gave information to the authorities, but the young man, hearing that he was to be arrested, fled to the mountains, and committed suicide by plunging into a cataract. Nothing like an incredulous doctor for converting a spirit into flesh and blood A FvL-BLooDzEDA m    rAX   .-Tim   Mullowney, a  jollylooking tar, with the richest of brogues, applied at the Custom-11ouse the other day, for  "protection" s an  American citizen.

"Now, madam," said he playfully, "pray keep it out." The hint was taken. He rarely-met his match; but on one occasion fairly owned that he had. He was sent for by an inn-keeper, who had had a quarrel with his wife, who had scored his face with her nails, so that the poor man was bleeding, and much disfigured. Mr. Abernethy considered this an opportunity not to be lost for admonishing the offender, and said, "Madam, are you not ashamed of yourself, to treat your husband thus-the husband, who is the head of all-your head, madam, in fact?" "Well, doctor," fiercely returned the virago, " and may I not scratch my own head?" Upon this, her friendly adviser, after giving directions for the benefit of the patient, turned on his heel and owned himself beaten for once.   OHT-OHAT.

THEY tell a capital story of Horace Vernet, the eminent French painter, recently; but before we quote it, let us mention a single occur- rence and a similar, which happened on one occasion in one of the tun- nels on the Hudson River Railroad. A very pretty lady was seated opposite to a good-looking gentleman, who was probably accompanying a party to Saratoga Springs. It was observed that this exceedingly handsome young woman had the smallest bit of court-plaster on a slight abrasion of the surface of her red upper lip. As the cars rum- bled into the darkness of the tunnel, a slight exclamation of "Oh!" was heard from the lady, and when the cars emerged to the light, the little piece of court-plaster aforesaid had become in some mysterious manner transferred to the upper lip of the young gentlemanl Curious, was it not? But now to the story of Vernet. The artist, so runs the anecdote, was coming from Versailles to Paris  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7492-00000046"/> 78           O H IT-CHAT. in the cars. In the same compartment with him were two ladies whom he had never seen before, but who were evidently acquainted with him. They-examined him very minutely, and commented upon him quite freely-upon his martial bearing, his hale old age, his military panta- loons, etc., etc. The painter was annoyed, and determined to put an end to the perse- cution As the train passed under the tunnel of St. Cloud, the three travellers were wrapped in complete darkness. Vernet raised the back of his hand to his mouth, and kissed it twice violently. On emerging from the obscurity he found that the ladies had withdrawn their atten- tion from him, and were accusing each other of having been kissed by a man in the dark! Presently they arrived at Paris; and Vernet, on leaving them, said, "Ladies, I sliall be puzzled all my life by the inquiry, ' WMich of these two ladies was it that kissed me ' " EMEMSON TRANSLATED BY A B'HOY.-Two B'hoys were reading Emerson the other day: upon their coming to this passage, '(Anglo-Saxonize your heads, my friends--think simply!"One says, "Wall I that's some punkins, I guess-but wot on airth does it mean, Bill " "Oh it's the gallus way of saying' Put your head in a bag 1'  Misanthropy.-Misanthropy is born of conceit, and expresses itself in morose ill-will, in the restlessness of suspicion, the severity of a rude censoriousness, the bitterness of envy, and the unscrupulousness of pride. It is eminently a selfish principle. It combines the arrogance of vanity with the peevishness of habitual ill-temper. It is not only predisposed to exaggerate the miseries of men; it is indisposed to con- tribute anything to their mitigation. If it weeps, it is from the sorrow of self-pity, rather than from a tender sympathy with others; and it more frequently indulges a cruel joy over the griefs it delights to depict. Its laugh is hoarse with malice. It blasphemes God, whilst it maligns mankind. Its pleasure is to give others pain. Instead of administering a salutary reproof to the wayward, it taunts him into persistency, and then mocks his folly. Its weapon is satire, its habits scandal. It leers, and grins, and croaks. It is heartless, remorseless, hopeless.

His mother, a quiet, elderly lady, he has left behind long ago, as well as two old maiden aunts. A aERTATN wise man said, "There was but one good woman in the world," and his advice was, that every married man should think his own wife was she, as being the only way to live content. MOOSE HUNTING. "EUTENANT HARDY, who has spent some time in the North American forests, gives, in a book he has recently published, some graphic pictures of the life of a moose hunter. He says: "The moose deer is the monarch of the North American forests, which boast of no lions, tigers, or elephants At full growth, the bull-. moose looks tall on the legs, with short neck and disproportionate long head, with massive and palmated antlers, large black expressive eyes, and with a dark. brown or glossy black bristly coat. He stands about seventeen hands high, and weighs from a thousand to twelve hundred pounds. Though very shy and wild, they are easily tamed if caught yonng, and speedily become the most domestic of pets. The author was fortunate enough to obtain one young calf, which was so tame that he would come into a room and jump several times over chairs, backwards and forwards, for a piece of bread. He had a great penchant for tobacco smoke, which, if puffed in his face, would cause him to rub his head with great satisfaction against the individual. "His gambols were sometimes very amusing. Throwing back his ears and dropping the under paw, he would gallop madly up and down on a grass plot, now and then rearing up on his hind legs, and striking ferociously with his fore-feet at the trunks of trees, or anything within reach, varying the amusement by an occasional shy and kick behind at some imaginary object. No palings could keep him from gardens, in which, when not watched, he would constantly be found, revelling on the boughs of currant and lilac bushes; in fact, tasting fruits and flowers most indiscriminately. On being approached for the purpose of being turned out, the cunning little brute would immediately lie down, from which position, his hide being as callous as that of a jackass, he could be got up with difficulty." The Lieutenant and an Indian companion go moose hunting, and after many unsuccessful efforts, hit upon a good track. Hear him:  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7492-00000047"/> 80           OH IT-ORAdT. "We turned into the woods, and soon found the fresh track of an immense herd of moose. "The wind now blew steadily, and made melancholy music among the branches of the lofty hemlocks through which the chase led us, drowning the crackling of the frozen snow under our moccasins. Still our utmost caution was necessary, for the fine ear of the moose will, even in a gale of wind, detect the snapping of the smallest twig, or any noise foreign to the natural sounds of the forest, at a great dis- 'tance. "Now is the time to see the Indian in his element and on his mettle. See how his eyes glisten, as he bends down and scrutinizes the tall, slea- der stem of a young maple, the red, juicy top of which has been bitten off at the height of some nine or ten feet from the ground. Now he stops and fingers the track, crumbling the lumps of snow dislodged by the huge foot, to tell the very minutes that have elapsed since the animal stood there. "On we go, every foot stepping in the track of the leading Indian, our arms employed in carefully drawing aside the branches which impede our progress, and preventing the barrels of our guns from noisy contact with the stems or boughs of the trees. The dense shrubbery of stunted evergreens, through which we had been worming our way for the last twenty minutes, appeared to be getting thinner, and we were about to emerge into an open space, with clumps of young hardwood interspersed through a lofty grove of pines and hemlocks, when Williains suddenly withdrew his foot from a step which would have exposed him, and stepped behind a young spruce, his excited face beaming with delight as he beckoned me to advance. "There stood or reposed the stupendous animals in every variety of posture. Some were feeding, others standing lazily chewing the cud, and flapping -their broad ears, now and then stopping to snatch a mouthful of the pure snow. About fifty yards distant, in a clump of tall dead ferns and briers, stood a huge bull, with a splendid coat. Levelling at him, I discharged both barrels of my smooth bore, one at, and the other behind, the shoulder,. He dropped, and the rest of the herd, discovering their foes, plunged off through the bushes, knocking over the dead trees in their way as if they had been ninepins. "(An exciting chase follows, for the bull has yet life enough in him to. lead them a hard gallop for some miles. But the most interesting phase of moose shooting is 'calling' the moose, and hearing the noble beast   OHT-OHAT.              81 crush through bush and brier, grunting and roaring in answer to the call. "Paul commenced operations by cautiously ascending a tall spruce fir which stood a few yards from the camp, and seated himself on a con- torted branch near -the top. Breaking off a dead bough with a loud snap, to imitate a moose walking through thick cover, he applied the call to his lips, and gave a short, low ' quoh.' "A few minutes' pause, and he'broke two or three branches in sharp succession, uttering another ' quoh' louder than the first. Then draw- ing a long breath, he commenced the plaintive cry, gradually increasing in intensity and force, which the lonely cow-moose is supposed to utter to attract the attention of her consort. "Away went the' call,' reverberating through the stems of the forest trees, and left us restraining our breath, and listening for the slightest sound in return. Nothing came, however, till a gust of wind, gathering in the distant hills, came rushing on through the forest, making the tall pines bend as it passed over us. "Suddenly Paul and I look at each other. We had both heard it. I hear it again, and this time quite plain. "' Quoh I Quohl Quoh I' "It is an answer. Paul at once drops his call into the laurels, and rapidly descends the tree. "'How far is he off, Paul  How far is he offf' whispered I, fum- bling, in my excitement, for a fresh cap. "'Quite handy, not more than quarter mile away.  Come here, and no move till I tell you," said the Indian, dragging me quickly to a clump of young spruces behind, in which we crouched for shelter from the quick sight of the wary brute. "We heard the twigs snap, and the rustling of his feet in the laurel&amp; He seemed to be making a detour.- Suddenly he uttered a roar, the counterpart of the sound uttered by the moose I had wounded, and crashing through the thicket, left us no hope of obtaining,a shot at him.

A college friend did himself the honor of becom- ing a customer of one of these superfine scientific tailors, who made him a pair of morning trousers. They did not fit with that mathematical exactitude which was expected from an artist of such high pretensions. There was a twist in one of the legs. Our friend expostulated. The tailor was grieved and even moved to find his reputation so imminently jeopardized. He laid the dreadful garhient on his counter, he measured and remeasured, he drew a diagram of the original projection by which the material had been cut, and yet he could not find a hair's-breadth of error. He was extremely puzzled. At length, in "going over" the knees he perceived that the cloth had been stretched. The mystery was solved, and he turned upon his 1" client" a look of piercing severity. "I beg your paidon," he said, in accents of subdued displeasure, "I hope when you gave the order-I understood you aright; you intended these as morning or walking trousers." "I did." "Why, Mein Gott I sir," exclaimed the schneider, no longer able to control his feelings, "you've been actually sitting down in them r' A YouNG lady, who, perhaps, was better acquainted with French than farming, was recently-married to a farmer.

'I '1 -U J A T . "A Wictim."-- Mr. Russell formerly resided in Schoharie. He how lives in Albany. Russell appears to be the victim of unpropitious circumstances Russell has an unhappy faculty of doing business contrary to law.  On Tuesday, Mr. Russell was arrested for the eleventh time since autumn set in. We give his examination: "Well, Russell, you are here again, I perceive." "Yes, sir. The fact is, squire, I'm a wictim. Blowme if I care what Bobby Russell does, he is sure to wiolate some law or other. When I comes to Albany, I says tomyself, Russell, my boy, we'll take a hunt to- morrow, and try them fox-hounds. Well, sir, out I goes, and what do you think I Before I got to the next corner, Barney Whalen tapped me on the shoulder, and says, ' Old feller, that's agin the law I' ' What's agin the law,' I replies; and he says, 'having dogs in the street without muzzles.' He accordingly arrested me and brought me to the police court. The result of that piece of fun was a fine of five dollars. Well, what did I do then I'" "Can't say." "Well, listen and I'll tell you. I sold the fox-hounds to one of Aunt Put's friends for twenty dollars. With the proceeds, I bought a sow and five pigs. I took them home, built a pen in the back yard, and thought all my troubles were at an end; but I was mistaken. Officer Bradwell called npon me the very next morning, and says, 'Russell, keeping hogs in the yard is agin the law.' I doubted it. This riled officer Bradwell, who had me arrested again. This time I was fined five dollars." "Well, what did you then 8" "I sold my sow and pigs, and bought a horse and cart, and undertook to draw wood. The very first load I put on drew the attention of policeman Sickles, who said that driving a cart without a license was 'agin the law.' He arrested me for that offence, which caused me another fine of five dollars." "Well, what did you do next!" "I sold the horse and cart, and bought the half of a charcoal wagon." "Well, what success did you meet with after that!" "The same old luck, sir. The first day I commenced peddling, policeman Snooks took me by the collar, and says, 'Russell, that's agin the law, old feller.' ( What's agin the law?' I said. He replied, ' selling charcoal in a wooden measure.' That cost me a fine of three dollars." "Did that drive you out of the charcoal business?"   Ht-OHAT.              86 "Yes, sir. I sold out, and thought I would try my fortune in carry- ing baggage between the steamboats and railroads. But what's the use? I only commenced work to-day, and yet here I am again." "What for now!" "For soliciting luggage without a permit from the mayor. As I said before, I'm a wictim. If I should save a man from drowning by jump. ing into a whirlpool, dash my vig if I don't believe the first policeman I met in coming ashore would up and say, 'It's agin the law, Russell, to go overboard without a license from the coroner.' The justice having heard Mr. Russell to the end, admitted that he was a " wictim," and let him off this time without paying a fine. Russell left the office, saying that he would go and kill himself " if it were not for one thing." On being asked what that was, he replied that some policeman would discover it was " agin the law to commit suicide," and undertake to collect the fine from his " misfortinit children." Russell's case calls for sympathy. We hope it will meet with it. "WHAT'S the matter, there, Cora? have you got afit!" "No, papa-they don't fit me at all," said she. And then she enume. rated all the faults of the shoes in set terms; and reached the climax thus: , They are the meanest shoes I ever saw; why, they won't even squeak when I walk out!" Early Times in Idi lana.--Said Major Oudesley, as he casually drop- ped in on us yesterday morning and commenced talking away in his usual quiet, chatty, and peculiar manner- "I'm sick aid tired of this artificial way of doing things in these latter days." "Why so, Major?" "There is an eternal sight too much parade about everything that is going on. I was at a wedding last night; the daughter of an old and much esteemed friend was to be married, and I was so urgently invited that I couldn't help going. "There was so much fuss and parade that I was perfectly disgusted. I could not help comparing the proceedings where a couple was married in Lawrenceburgh many years ago, when Indiana formed a part of the great north-western territory. At the time the settlements of the emi- grants were mostly confined to the rich bottom lands of the water- courses  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7492-00000050"/> bo           CHT-CHAT. "Lawrenceburgh was a small village, of a few log cabins. My father was acting magistrate for the district, and very promptly at- tended to all the various duties of that office, in addition to which he was in the habit of doing a great deal of manual labor on his own hook." "That was when you wasn't big enough to do much, Major." "Exactly; I was a tow-headed brat of some eight or ten years old, when the incident I am about to relate took place, but I remember all the particulars as well as if it had occurred yesterday. You see it was about dinner-time one day, in the fall of the year, when, the old man being engaged in laying in a supply of wood for the winter, drove up his ox-team, with a pretty solid load of fuel. "Just then a young and unsophisticated couple entered the village, hand in hand, inquired for the squire, and were duly directed to the house. The youth was barefooted, and wore a coarse but clean tow linen shirt and pants, and rough straw hat of home manufacture. His fair companion was dressed in a blue cotton frock, pink cotton apron, coarse bonnet, and brogan shoes, with stockings. "These were their wedding dresses, and their severe simplicity, and the thorough independence they manifested, made an impression upon my mind that will never be effaced. "'We have come to get married,' said the young man to the old lady, my mother, who was properly busy among the pots and kettles. "'That's very good, business,' said she, smiling graciously, 'though you appear to look very young; but there's the squire, just drove up; he'll splice you in less than no time.' "So out she bolted to give the fortunate functionary due notice of the important business in hand. "' I can't stop till I unload this wood,' said the old man; ' tell them to come out here.' "Out they went. "The old man was on the top of the cart, and every time he threw off a stick he asked a question. Before he was fairly unloaded, he had the youth's whole story, having ascertained the names, ages, and residence of the parties, how long he had known the young woman, if he really loved her, and was willing to labor honestly to promote her happiness, etc. "The youngster gave simple and satisfactory answers to all the ques- tions propounded.   OH IT-OHAT.              87 "In the meantime, the old lady, perfectly understanding dad's way of doing things, had sent out to say to the people that a wedding party was coming off at the house, and by the time the wood was unloaded, quite a crowd had collected to witness the ceremony. "The old fellow, havingpitched out the last stick, and picked up his long goad, stood up in the cart, and commenced the performance. "' Jest jine hands,' said he, to the young couple.         rr "It was done accordingly." "' I am satisfied with both of ye,' he continued: 'youv'e a perfect right to get married,' and he united 'em in short order. "' As the rafters on this house are joined together, so I jine you-you are wnan and wife-salute your bride. I don't charge you anything for the operation. Whoa haw, Buck-get along, BrightI' "With an elegant flourish of his long stick, he started for another load of wood, leaving the newly-wedded pair amid the villagers, kissing each other with a very distinct and particular evidence of satisfaction. "That was a wedding worth having," continued Major Oudesley; "I knew the couple afterwards and know them yet, for they are both living in a high state of prosperity. And I know their children after them; too, and mighty fine children they are, for one of them is at this very time Governor of Indiana." A   msRT-y. old farmer, who had lost one of his best hands in the midst of hay-making, remarked to the sexton, as he was filling up the poor fellow's grave: i"It's a sad- thing to lose a good mower at a time 'ike this-but, after all, poor Tom was a dreadful great eater." DURING the recent elections in Great Britain, one of the candidates for Edinburgh called upon a tradesman to solicit his vote. "I would rather vote for the devil than for you," was the reply..  "But, in case your friend should not come forward," said the candidate, "might I then count upon your assistance?" THE umbrella seems to be a doomed article. Every man's hand, ap- parently, is raised against it. Its fate is uncertain enough in America, but in Germany it seems to be much worse.

"Psi UPSILON" writes, that happening to be travelling in Connecticut last summer, he stopped at the city of Bridgeport; and while there, fell upon the following epitaph on a dog, in an adjoining field, where he was "fetching a walk:" IN MEMORY OF LEO. A FArrrtrL DOG; WHO WAS SHOT AaUGOST 80, 1886. Sic transit gloria mundi. ]Every dog must have his day, /e had his, and passed away. Poor fellow I little had he thought His dog-days were to be so short; He did not drain life's bitter cup- Death took him when he was a pup, And laid him here beneath this sod, As good a dog as ever trod. He sought for happiness in vain, But found all pleasure mixed with pain; And when his joy gave way to sadness, He groaned--and people deemed it madness; He had the stomach-ache so bad He howled, and then they said--' He's mad," And shot poor LEO by mistake, Because he had the belly-ache; He died without a fault-he left no foes, And one fierce struggle closed his earthly woes. New  England Hrumor.-As a specimen of many examples brought forward in a recent lecture upon the characteristics of New England humor, the Boston Post quotes the following:-       o "The lecturer was enforcing the idea that the sense of contrast and opposition of idea was often reached through the effect of total and embarrassing disappointment in the expected point of a story. Of this kind, he said, was a question which was once elicited from a grave matter-of-fact old man in the town of Andover," by an animated account of a fire in the neighborhood. As the usual occupants of the bar-room were sitting about the fire in the evening, each with his cigar and glass of suspicious-looking liquor in his hand, there entered a farmer from i  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7492-00000052"/> 90           CHT-OHA T, the' North Parish,' with the air of a man who had much on his mind to communicate. 4 Ye'd ought to a ben over to the North Parish this morning,' said he, ' there was a little the wost fire, I guess, that they havehad for twenty years in Essex county.

When this circumstantial narrative was concluded, there was a general silence -the result, probably, of sympathy for Mr. Pettingell, and of specula- tion, perhaps, upon the singularity of the accident which had led to his loss. After the lapse of- several minutes, however, the pause was broken by a dull, frosty-faced old fellow, who had been staring intently at the coals ever since the speaker had finished. Looking up with an as yet unsatisfied expression of face, he inquired:--' Well, did they kill the owl I'" WE know of nothing in Mrs. S. C. Hall's "Tales and Sketches of the Irish Peasantry" (one of the most natural and characteristic of all the books which describe the peculiarities of the Irish, in the "lower walks" of that unhappy country, that we have ever encountered), that excels the following specimen which some months ago found a place in our receptacle, cut from an American paper printed at the South. -It is a striking illustration of "The Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties." A round-faced, curly-haired Hibernian inquires at-the post-office for a letter for himself.

A FRIEND tells a good story of "Old Hays," when he was crier of the Court of Sessions. The room was usually warm, and he was very apt in the afternoon to drop away into a doze. On one occasion, while the Recorder was charging a jury, the old man snored quite audibly. An officer immedi- ately whispered in his ear, "Uncle Jacob, some one is snoring, and disturbing the court." Up jumped Hays, and with his stentorian lungs cried out-' "Silence I there must be no snoring in court!" And then, turning to the Recorder, he said- "You can go on now, without interruption!" The story is sometimes told of him, that on being awakened one day by a peal of thunder, he cried out, "Silence!" "Do you," said Fanny, t'other day, "In earnest, love me as you say? Or are those tender words applied Alike to fifty girls beside?" "Dear, cruel girl," cried I, "forbear, For by those eyes--those lips-I swear---" She stopped me as the oath I took, And cried, "You've sworn, now kiss the book!" Speedy Promotion.-One day, on the field, Napoleon's hat having fallen off, a young lieutenant stepped forward, picked it up, and pre- sented it to him. "Thank you, captain," said the Emperor inadver- tently. "In what regiment, Sire?" inquired the sub, quick as lightning. Napoleon smiled, and forthwith promoted the witty youth to a cap- taincy. Nonchalance..--An Englishman is not only fond of seeing sights, but he is also fond of expressing himself in his own peculiar and independ- ent style. One of that country applied, when at Berlin, to the lord- marechal to present him to the king, Frederick the Great. His lord- ship told him that it was not such' an easy matter, and that many great noblemen had been refused. "Faith," said the Englishman, " it is not that I care much about it; but as I have already seen five kings, I should have been glad to make up the half dozen."   CH IT-OHAT.             98 Don't do it Again.-St. Gregory the Great affirms that a little monk got into such a habit of working miracles, that at length the prior for- bade him to exercise his supernatural talent. The monk conformed to the order; but one day seeing an honest bricklayer falling from the roof of a house, he hesitated between the monastic obedience and charity in saving the poor man's life; and only ordering him to remain in the air till he got orders, he ran to acquaint the prior with the case. The prior gave him absolution for the sin of beginning a miracle without leave, and allowed him to go through with it, but never to do the like again. Moliere's Physician.-Though an habitual valetudinarian, Moli6re relied almost upon the temperance of his diet for the re-establishment of his health. "What use do you make of our physician 1" said the king to him one day. "We chat together, Sire," said the poet. "He gives me his prescriptions: I never follow them, and so I get well." One Shilling Each.--An attorney in Dublin having died exceedingly poor, a shilling subscription was set on foot to pay the expenses of his funeral. Most of the attorneys and barristers having subscribed, one of them applied to Toler, afterwards Lord Chief Justice Norbury, ex- pressing his hope that he would also subscribe his shilling.

The steamboat train, with a heavy passenger freight, came in about midnight, when the first tramp of travellers upon the stairs started the fair one from her maiden slumbers. More asleep than awake, and more anxious to see that all was right than either, the first motion of her arm brought down table, chairs and cricket, making a wreck of the looking-glass, and breaking a five-dollar comb into more than forty pieces I Folks thought the house was coming down. Everybody rushed to the entries, while the girl screamed, the parson prayed, and the women went into hysterics.

To the party most interested, the lesson, on the whole, was rather dearly bought.  We never meet prudish people without thinking of the very modest old maid who visited a newly married friend of hers for the-irst time after "the ceremony."

THERE is a large black-faced monkey to be met with throughout Bengal, which is denominated by the natives Hanneman, and which forms a very prominent feature in the extensive catalogue of their nurterous divinities. When Lieutenant-Colonel Wilkinson commanded the 22d regiment of 6  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7492-00000056"/> 98            OHT-OHAT. Native Infantry at the station of Minnapore, a large and aged banian tree grew on a spot adjacent to his dwelling which had been from time immemorial colonized by a tribe of the monkeys, who, by long right of usage, seemed to have claimed it as their freehold inheritance. Beneath this treestood a Hindoo temple, occupied by a Brahmin prlest, who was in the practice of feeding this negro fraternity with rice, fruits, and other dainty offerings, From long encouragement, these monkeys had become so daring that no portable article could be left safely within the sphere of their locomotive agency, and whatever object they got hold of, they invariably mounted the tree with it, and discussed its merits in comparative self-security, for they regarded this arborescent fastness as their sanctuary. Among some scores of these impudent marauders, was a remarkably robust, grey-bearded, active monkey, who had sustained a severe gash in his upper lip at some former period of his career, doubtless while engaged in some combative affray, which wouldhave ultimately become cicatrized; and upon this account, the Colonel, by way of contradistinc- tion, very appositely designated him Cutlip. This audacious trespasser was sure to be the very first and foremost in every furtive and mischievous encounter; and, indeed, so notorious had he become, that the word Cutlip, with the' whole of the native domestics, was as . "Familiar in their mouths as household words." Upon one occasion, the babauehee (cook) had carelessly left his turban suspended upon a peg behind the kitchen door, whilst he turned his back for a minute, to procure some necessary article, when, upon his return, he discovered, to his utter dismay, that his head-furniture was missing, and easting his eyes instinctively, as it were, up towards the tree, he observed autlip, to his no small mortification, busily occupied in unfolding the rolls of muslin, and intent upon ascertaining what might be at the bottom of the multiplied mystery. After having satisfied him- self to the full extent of his inquiries, he commenced rending the flimsy material asunder, which fell - piecemeal under the tree, like a shower of Bank of England notes; he then twice and once patted his posteriors, ascended one of the loftiest branches of the banian, and leisurely took a survey of the surrounding scenery with the most unaffected compla- cency. Upon this occasion he escaped with a few anathemas bestonwed upon his uninvited carease, by the indignant and provoked hireling of   CHT-OHAT.              99 the kitchen. Time rolled on, and Cutlip'as notoriety kept pace with its progress. One morning the Colonel, feeling himself unwell, indulged in bed longer than it was usual for him to do, and the door of his apartment being partially open, he fancied he caught a glimpse of some person approaching a conversation table in the room, upon which he had but a minute previously deposited a valuable family gold snuff-box. He instantly directed his attention to the furniture, and missed his box. Leaping out of bed, and seizing the chamber utensil in his hand, he gave immediate chase to the hairy felon, shoutinoutut at the top of his voice, ,( Bunder puckerhu" (stop the monkey), "Choor puckerhu" (stop thief). There was a wall, six feet high, which separated a court on the Colonel's premises, on which the temple was situated, and the monkey was in the act of attempting to surmount this barrier, when the chasseur dismissed the bed-side weapon he had in his hand at the fugitive, which operated as so many shrapnel shells exploding about his head and shoulders, as the vessel fell in shattered fragments from lthe side ot the wall, which the thief was in the act of ascending. Cutlip dropped the valuable relic from his paw, uttering the most piercing screams; but he eventually succeeded in clearing the fence and reaching his sanctuary in safety. The Hindoos will upon no account whatever destroy the animal- holding it sacred; nor will they readily forgive those- whose religious persuasions may entirely differ from their own, who take away the life of a monkey; upon this latter'account, it is deemed consistent with right policy for Europeans sojourning in India to abstain from adopting a practice which is viewed in a light of irreverence by the Hindoo population. The Colonel, however, with a view to obviate any further annoyance on the part of this arrogant intruder, proceeded, after he had finished his breakfast, to the bazaar, and procured a large iron-toothed rat trap, which he brought home with him, and tying the tail of the trap to the leg of a table in the room, he carefully baited it with a fresh-plucked irresistibly tempting morsel in the character of a custard apple (surruff. nur). Leaving the parlor door partly ajar, he betook himself to the stables, to inspect his nags. in less than ten minutes after he had quitted the room, the bag-pipes struck up the old well-known air- "'There's nae luck about the house." The Colonel readily recognised the music, as well as the source whence it proceeded; and hastening back to the chamber, he there found Mr. Cutlip a prisoner in durance  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7492-00000057"/> 100            H I T - H a' T . vile. How to release his unlucky paw out of purgatory, was now a grave question. Whilst the tortured limb wrung forth from its owner the most over- whelming accents of throbbing agony, the creature's incessant screech- ing summoned to the spot some scores of other monkeys, who came to   . see what was the matter; and although they could not assist him, they ; evinced their hostile intentions towards the Colonel by exposing their phalanxes of dentition, and chattering the most ill-fraught menaces, inso- much that he was, in self-defence, necessitated to handle his Joe Manton, at the sight of which they speedily decamped. With the aid of two of the servants, the Colonel, with some difficulty, succeeded in getting the i captive free, who went limping away like a ricketty tripod set in clumsy motion; but from that day, the person of Cutlip was never more recog- nised. It is a well known fact that a dead monkey is a circumstance seldom witnessed in India; and it is upon this account that the natives attribute to this animal the peculiar faculty of interring its dead: but it is far more probable that when a monkey sickens unto death, the crea- ture retires into some secluded bush in the jungle, there to discharge the last functions of life; and Cutlip, there can be little doubt, died in the above obscure manner, having pined away to death with pain and exhaustion.  For three successive nights following, the Colonel and two of the officers of the 22d Regiment, stormed this monkey fortress by throwing among the branches a plentiful stock of ignited squibs and crackers. Some of the inhabitants were to be heard screeching in despair; others fainted and fell beneath the tree; and the effects of the siege were so woful in the issue, that on the fourth day after opening the assault, not a monkey was to be seen within a mile of the premises. A Bold and Ingenious Swindle.-A scamp in Baltimore recently succeeded in getting a pair of new pants in the following novel man- ner: A gentleman residing in this city had ordered a valuable pair made of the finest cassimere, at one of the most fashionable stores in the city. Upon their being finished, they were sent home to him. Imme- dintely on their delivery, a well dressed young man applied at the door for them, stating they had been sent in by mistake, and were not the ones designed for him, but that he had called to procure and change them, and would at once, if they were delivered to him, send the proper ,   COIT-nHAT.             101 ones home. Thinking all right, the gentleman ordered his servant to deliver them up, but no others coming to hand, he called upon the tailor, who was astonished at his inquiries, inasmuch as his boy had been sent home with them, and upon the boy being called, he verified the statement, stating further that he had been met on the way by a man who endeavored to get possession of the pants upon a plea of being the man who ordered them, but that he had refused to give them to him, knowing that he was not the party for whom they were made. From this it appears that the man then followed him to the house, and in the manner stated succeeded in accomplishing his object, notwith- standing his first failure. Mrs. Partington.-, So they have denominated Dr. Shirtless," said Mrs. Partington, as she heard of the selection of Dr. Shurtleff by the Know-Nothings.   She had known the doctor for many years, and had admired his excellence as a man, and his ability as a physician. "Well, he is a good man, and I dare say the city will become better by a change  i of doctors, if he is electric. I hope he will give it a good purgatory, and work off all its corruption, for heaven knows it needs it enough. I wonder what doctor they will have next, if he don't do no good-Dr. Barker, I guess; he that gives his patience the syllabub omnibus decanter, as they call it, and cures 'em by hellbroth and deadly nightshade, done up in sugar plums." The noise of an omnibus rendered her remarks inaudible, but her mouth kept on moving, like a wheel, from its own impetus, after the belt of the engine has been removed, while Ike was trying to twist a nervous dog's tail in the crook of his hawkey.  "HERE'S your money, dolt. Now, tell me why your scoundrelly master wrote me eighteen letters about that contemptible sum?" said an exasperated debtor.

Good Character.-The late Lord Eldon had occasion to discharge a coachman whom he suspected of purloining his corn. In a few days he received a letter from a merchant, inquiring into the man's character, and his lordship's reply was that he was sober, and a good coachman, but he entertained suspicions that he had cheated him. The man came the next morning to return thanks to his lordship for procuring him so excellent a place: "My master," said he, " was contented to find I was sober, and a good coachman; but as to cheating your lordship, he thought that the devil himself could not do it." DR. WALL once, at a dinner party, very unwisely persisted in play- ing with a cork, in such a manner as displayed a hand long divorced from soap and water. One guest expressed his surprise to another, and, in too loud a whisper, exclaimed, "Heavens, what a dirty hand " The doctor overheard, and turning sharply round, said, "Sir, I'll bet you a guinea there's a dirtier one in company." "Done," replied the first, sure of winning. The guineas were staked, and the doctor showed his other hand. He was judged to have won without a dis- senting voice.

"WE are going to Australia," said a somewhat pompous gentleman  of narrow means, to a friend of ours, the other day. "Why so?" was the rejoinder.

The Tomb of Pizarro.--In the crypt under the high altar at Lima, are deposited the remains of the celebrated Pizarro, who was assassi- nated in the palace. A small piece of- silver which I dropped into the hand of the attending sacristan, procured me admission into the crypt. Descending a few steps, I entered a small place, some twenty feet long, quite light and white-washed, and which smelled and looked so much like a comfortable ,wine cellar, that I caught myself more than once looking round for bins and bottles. The first object that I saw was a large, square tomb, surmounted by the erect figure of an abbot; and close by, in a narrow opening in the wall, I noticed what appeared to me to be a collection of dusty rags; but a closer inspection proved that this was all that remained of the great conqueror of Peru. He had still on him the clothes and shoes which he wore at the time of his assassination. Of course his body is nothing but a skeleton, covered with dried flesh and skin, so that no features are discernible. The body was covered with what was once white linen, swathed round him; but the dust of centuries had collected on it, and turned it into a light brown color, and it almost pulverizes when touched. The body is placed on a narrow piece of plank, in a sloping position, and has been placed in this hole merely to put it out of the way. The folks in Lima do not think anything of the remains of poor Pizarro; and I dare say that a little money judiciously invested, would procure for any curiosity hunter the whole of his remains.

ON Wednesday se'nnight a scene took place in the Champs Elys6es, almost unrivalled in the annals of romance. The tenor Borsari, who has had a most magnificent success, and in Italy in particular, has taken advantage dof a conge, to visit Paris. Yesterday evening he was walking upder the trees in the Champs Elysees, near the Seine, when he caught the sight of an old man, neatly dressed, dragging forth from an old fiddle some faint sounds, to which none listened. Borsari started, struck his hand upon his forehead to collect his thoughts, and then, leaving the ladies, rushed up to -the poor musician. "Ecco mi: it is me," said he, in a ringing voice. The old man raised his head in astonishment. "Don't you recognise me, Giacomo? I am Borsari; your pupil; he to whom you opened up the musical career-he who owes to you his reputation and his fortune." "Borsari " said the vocalist "Ah! now I remember. You have fulfilled my predictions-you have collected gold and fame. I am pleased at it in the midst of my misfortunes a" ("My poor master, what has reduced you to this extremity?" Then the old man told his history. He had, at the head of a troop of singers, gone through the Isles of Greece; but misfortune had every- whllere been his fate.  After a miraculous escape from shipwreck, he got sick. Incompletely cured, he came to Paris to an old pupil, a lady, who was kind to him, but who suddenly died. Giacomo then went into the orchestra of a little theatre, but at last, reduced to the last ex- tremity, he came to play in the Champs Elysees. While the old man spoke, Borsari was feeling his pockets. All he found was a couple of pounds. Suddenly he took a bold resolution. "Giacomo, do you recollect the great air of la Calonnia " "Yes." "Can you execute the accompaniment " "Somehow 8" "Begin." At once in a ringing and splendid voice, Borsari commenced this magnificent piece. A crowd collected-the singing cafes were deserted -carriages drew up-and a fashionable audience descended from them. At the sight of such an audience the old man roused himself; his bow, directed by a firm hand, drew forth delicious sounds. The audience were struck with admiration, and the setting sun seemed to transport 6*5" 1i  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7492-00000060"/> 106          CHT-CHAT. every one to Italy. When he ended, the tenor took round his hat. No one refused. Gold poured in as well as silver: and when he had emptied his own purse amongst the heap of gold, he gave it to the old man, exclaiming- "Giacomo, this is on -account. I shall see you again" The Duke of Wellington.-Some years since, the Duke was sitting at his library-table, when the door opened, and, without any announce- ment, in stalked a figure of singularly ill-omen "( Who're you?" asked the Duke, in his short dry manner, looking-up without the least change of countenance upon the intruder "I am Apollyon." "What want?" "I am sent to kill you." "( Kill me-very odd."  "I am Apollyon, and I must put you to death." "'Bliged to do it to-day?" "I am not told the day or the hour, but I must do my mission." "Very inconvenient-very busy-great many letters to write-call again and write me word-I'll be ready for you." And the Duke went on with his correspondence. The maniac, appalled, probably, by the stern unmovable old man, backed out of the room, and in half an hour was safe in Bedlam.

That friend is long since dead; but his son, now in the vale of years, lives, and I doubt not, from the reverence felt to the great author of Paradise Lost, that he has religiously preserved the precious relic. It might not be agreeable to him to have his name published; but from his tastes-he being a person of some distinction in literary pursuits-he is likely to be a reader of Notes and Queries, and if this should catch his eye, he may be induced to send you some particulars-I know he is able to place the matter beyond a doubt.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7492-00000061"/> 108           OH I T - C II A T. CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS. ENGLAND Was always famous among foreigners for the celebration of Christmas, at which season they admitted sports and pastimes, not known in other countries. "At the feast of Christmas," says Stowe, " in the King's court, wher- ever he chanced to reside, there was appointed a Lord of Misrule, or master of merry disports; the same merry fellow made his appearance at the house of every nobleman and person of distinction; and among the rest, the lord mayor of London and the sheriffs had their lords of misrule, ever contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make the rarest pastime to delight the beholders." The society of Lincoln's Inn had an officer chosen at this season, who was honored with, the title of King of Christmas Day, because he presided in the hall on that day, with his marshal and. steward to attend him, The marshal, in the absence of the monarch, was permitted to assume his state; and upon New-Year's day he sat as king in the hall, when the master of the revels, during the time of dinner, supplied the marshal's place. The custom of going a-begging, called hagmena, a few nights before Christmas, singing Christmas carols, and wishing a happy new year, is still followed in the north of England. They get, in return, apples, nuts, refreshments, and money. Mumming is another Christmas droll- ery, which consists in men and women changing clothes; and, so dis- guised, going from one neighbor's house to another, partaking of Christ- mas cheer. On the night of Christmas Eve, it was formerly the practice to light up candles of an uncommon size, calledl Christmas candles, and lay a log of wood on the fire, called a yule log, to illuminate the house, and turn, as it were, day into night. In the Latin, or western church, Christmas was called the Feast of Lights. The forms of the Twelfth Day vary in different countries, yet all agree in the same end, to do honor to the Eastern Magi, who are sup- posed to have been of royal dignity. It is in the south of England where the customs of this day are most prevalent. They are thus de- scribed by Brand:-After tea a cake is produced, and two bowls, con- taining the fortunate chances for the different sexes The host fills up the tickets, and the whole company, except the, king and queen, are to be ministers of state, and maids of honor, or ladies of the bedchamber. Often the host and hostess, more by design than accident, become king and queen. The twelfth cake was made formerly of plums, with a bean   OH T -  H A T.            10 and pea-who found the former was king, who got the latter was queen. The choosing of a king and queen by a bean in a piece of divided cake, was formerly a common Christmas gambol in both the universities. Christmas boxes are derived from a custom of the ancients, of giving new year's gifts. In papal times, the priests had their Christmas box,  in which were kept the sums they levied on the people for prayers and granting absolution for sins. Decking houses and churches with evergreens is another custom of pagan origin. The ancient Druids decked their houses with holly and ivy in December, that the sylvan spirits might repair to them, and re- main unnipped by the frost and cold winds, till a milder season had renewed the foliage of their favorite abodes. But for a more particular account of Christmas customs and festi- vities we must refer the reader to Mr. Brand's large work, or to Wash- ington Irving.  I shall conclude with a good old Christmas carol from Poor Robin's Almanack, for 1695, and preserved in Brand's Popular Antiquities. A CHEISTMA  SONG.

It is an error that the scorpion stings itself when surrounded by fire, and that music has power over persons bitten by it; that the mole has no eyes, nor elephant knees; that the hedge-hog is a mischievous ani- mal, particularly that he sucks cows when they are asleep, and causes their teats to be sore. It is said the porcupine shoots out its quills for annoying its enemy, whereas it only sheds them annually, as other feathered animals do. The jackall is commonly called the lion's provider, but it has no connex- ion with the lion. The bite of the spider is not venomous-it is found, too, in Ireland, plentifully-has no dislike to fixing its web on Irish oak, and has no particular aversion to a toad. The ass was vulgarly thought to have had a cross on its back ever since Christ rode on one of those animals. It was also believed the haddock had the mark of St. Peter's thumb, ever since St. Peter took the tribute penny out of a fish of that species. It was anciently believed, says Brand, that the barnacle, a common shell-fish, which is found sticking on the bottom of ships, would, when broken off, become a species of goose. Nor is it less an error that bears form their cubs by licking them into shape; or that storks will only live in republics and free states. "The Rose of Jericho," which was feigned to flourish every year about Christmas eve, is famous in the annals of credulity; but, like the no less celebrated "Glastenbury Thorn," is only a monkish imposture. It is commonly believed, and even proverbial, that puppies see in nine days, but the fact is, they do not see till the twelfth or fourteenth.   OHT- IIAT.

That the forbidden fruit, mentioned in Genesis, was an apple, is gene- rally believed, confirmed by tradition, perpetuated by writing, verses, and pictures, but without authority. The umbilical cord is known to appertain only to the foetus, and as Adam and Eve never were in that state, Sir Thomas Browne notices the vulgar error of exhibiting them in pictures with navels. The same writer also remarks the common practice of picturing Moses with horns on his head, for which there is no authority-and it does not appear he was ever married. Errors on Man.-It was formerly believed (Browne's Works, folio, p. 66) that Jews stink naturally; but this is a prejudice on a parl with Mr. Cobbett's notion, that negroes do not smell like other men. It is also an error, with respect to the latter, that they are not a part of the human race, which Fovargue calls a "Creolian error;" and that they are the descendants of Cain, bearing his mark. It is commonly believed that men float on the ninth day after sub- mersion in the water; but the time is uncertain, and depends on the habit of body; fat men undergo a chemical change much sooner than lean men, and consequently float sooner. The analogy does not hold, that men naturally swim like other animals; the motion of animals in the water is the same as on land; but men do not swim as they walk. It is more correct that women, when drowned, lie prostrate in the water, and men supine; it arises from the different conformation of the two sexes. That a man has one rib less than a woman is a vulgar error, both men and women have each twenty-four ribs. It was an opinion formerly, that it was conducive to a man's health to be drunk once a month. The age of 63 was called the "great climacteric," and considered peculiarly dangerous, because it was the product of the two odd num- bers 7 and 9. That a man weighs more fasting than full; that he was anciently larger in stature; that love and lust are the same thing; that he is bet- ter or worse for being of a particular profession, have been classed by writers among vulgar errors.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7492-00000063"/> "2           cH IT -HAT. EIistorical Errors.-Slr Thomas Browne says, it is an error that Tamerlane the Tartar was a shepherd; he was of noble birth. The popular story that Belisarius was blind, and begged publicly in the streets, is without foundation; he suffered much from the envy of the court, but contemporary writers do not mention his mendicity or blindness. .The stories of Scsevola, of Curtius, of the Amazons, and of Archimedes burning the ships of Marcellus, are, doubtless, historical- lies, or monstrous exaggerations. It is related that Crassus, the grandfather of Marcus, the wealthy Roman, never laughed but once, and that was at'an ass eating thistles. That Jesus never laughed, because it is only mentioned he wept; though, as Browne observes, it is hard to conceive how he passed his childhood without mirth. Many vulgar errors prevail respecting gypsies, and counterfeit Moors. They are said to have come originally from Egypt, and their present state to be a judgment of God upon them, for refusing to entertain the Virgin Mary and Jesus, on their flight into Egypt. They existed in Egypt long before this occurrence, where they were considered strang- ers. They were called Bohemians in France, where they first-appeared from Germany, and spoke the Sclavonian language. They were at one time countenanced by the Turks; suffered to keep stews in the suburbs of Constantinople, and employed by them as spies among other nations, for which they were banished by the Emperor Charles the Fifth. Miscellaneous Errors.--From the rising of the dog-star the an- cients computed their canicular days; concerning which there is an opinion, that during those days all physic should be declined, and the cure committed to nature. This season is called the .Physician's vaca- tion. It was formerly believed, that the, tenth wave was more dangerous, and the tenth egg larger than any other. The ring was formerly worn on the fourth finger of the left hand, from a supposition that a particular nerve in that part communicated with the heart. Fovargue includes in his "Catalogue of Vulgar Errors," the notion of Londoners, that they have wit enough to impose on countrymen. "This Error," says he, " chiefly proceeds from the outward appearance of countrymen, when they arrive at the metropolis. They are struck with the grandeur of this place, and on that account keep their heads   OHiT-OHAT.            113 up in the air, as if they were contemplating some phenomenon in the heavens. Then, their clothes being calculated for strength and wear, or spun thick, which gives them a stiff awkward gait, and 'this is not a little augmented by the robust labor they undergo. This awkwardness, joined to an absence which the contemplation of anything fine is sure to beget, makes high diversion for the Londoners, who are apt to put tricks upon them, and tax them with want of apprehension." The same author also reckons among Vulgar Errors, that, the Italian opera consists of effeminate music; that nothing is poetry but what is in rhyme; that kicking up the heels behind, and twisting rount on one leg, is fine skating; that the more ammunition is put into a fowling- piece the more execution it will do; and that using. hard words and long sentences is a proof of scholarship. AN amusing colloquy came off recently at the supper table on board of one of our Eastern steamboats, between a\ Boston exquisite, reeking with hair-oil and Cologne, who was " demming" the waiters, and other- wise assuming very consequential airs, and a raw Jonathan, who sat by his side, dressed in homespun. Turning to his "vulgar" friend, the former pointed his jewelled finger, and said: "Butter, sah!" "I see it is," coolly replied Jonathan. "Butter, sah, I say!" fiercely repeated the dandy. "I know it-very good-a first-rate article," provokingly reiterated homespun. "BUTTER, I tell you!" thundered the exquisite in still louder tones, pointing with slow unmoving finger, like scorn's, and scowling upon his neighbor, as-if he would annihilate him. "Well, gosh-all-Jerusalem, what of it'" now yelled the downeaster, getting his dander up in turn--"Yer didn't think I took it for lard?"

The Wrong Way to Cork.--Mr. Kenny, the popular dramatist, in drinking a glass of wine, inadvertently swallowed a small substance which nearly choked him. A friend, seeing his distress, and anxious to proclaim to his companion the sad state of the case, exclaimed: "It is a cork gone the wrong way." "I don't know whether it is the way to Cork," said a wag, who was present, "but it seems a very likely way to kill Kenny."

Singular Phenomenon.--Two of our lady friends were reading the other day, Byron's Prisoner of Chillon. We intended to say that one lady was pretending to read aloud to the other lady.

So that at the very commencement, when the reader read the passage- , Now grew it white, In a single night, As man's has grown from sudden fears-- " the listener interposed as follows: "White How odd, to be sure I Well, I know nothing about men's hair: but there is our friend Mrs. G---, of Twelfth Street, the lady who has just been twenty-nine years old for the last fifteen years-her husband died, you know, last winter, at which misfortune her grief was so intense that her hair turned completely black within twenty-four hours after the occurrence of that sad event." Caution for the Kitchen.--If you cut horseradish, ten to one you get into a scrape. AN old maid is like an odd boot-of no use without a fellow. A BLACKSMrH was lately summoned to a county court as a witness' in a dispute between two of his workmen. The judge, after hearing the testimony, asked him why he did not advise them to settle, as the costs had already amounted to three times the disputed sum. He replied, "I told the fools to settle; for I said the clerk would take their coats, the lawyers their skirts, and if they got into your honor's court you'd skin 'em." AT a church in Scotland, two candidates offered to preach, whose names were Adam and Low.

Portrait of Bulwer the Novelist.-Of his personal appearance we need say little. For in the true orator, all personal peculiarities are soon forgotten. He is somewhat tall, and very spare, almost attenuated. He has a fine head and face, of which the portrait by Maclise gives a good representation. His nose is large, sharp, and prominen't-fulfilling Napoleon's requirement of a man with a large nose for great enterprises. His action in speaking is good, though not perfect. Sometimes it is a little "wild;" as when he draws back his head and slim body, and * extends his arms, making one feel uncomfortable lest he should lose ba- lance and upset. His voice is good,-strong, but not musical; and per- haps he is wanting in that delicate inflection of tone-that variety, and light and shade, which the great orator is so careful to cultivate. Had Bulwer's practice been greater, doubtless he would have remedied such defects; for we must not forget that his life has been that of a student and a literary man, rather than that of a man of action and of public enterprise.

TmE old proverb, "There is nothihg new under the sun," may be trans- lated into " there is nothing new, but what may be found in old Shak- spere." A thought-torturing friend has claimed for Coleridge the in- ventions of the steamship and of the atmospheric railroad, and brings this verse to prove it:- "She steadies on with upright keel, Without a sail or wind, For the air is cut away before, And closes fast behind." He contends that the two first lines prophesy the Steamer, which moves against tide, and without sail, while the principle of the atmo- spheric Railway is clearly defined in the last two lines. Charles Lamb was very fond of ridiculing these far-fetched analogies, and one evening undertook to prove that the Chinese Fo was the same as the Hebrew Noah, which he did thus: "You have only to take the F away from Fo and put N and you have No, and if you add to NO-Au, which is very easily done, you have NOAH, which proves my case com- pletely." Pierce Pungent, however, has no such necessity to prove the heredi- tary descent of Shillibeer from Shakspere, we mean of Mrs. Parting- ton from Dogherry, the intervening link being Mrs. Malaprop. We are convinced our excellent friend Mrs. Partington will not object to be the granddaughter of Dogherry, and the daughter of Mrs. ]Malaprop, for she must necessarily have the mental blood of Shakspere and Sheridan in her veins. It is something for the letter s to boast that they are the initial of Shakspere, Sheridan, and Shillibeer: a trinity sufficient to console it for being the beginning of SMTH. Never were these natures more distinctive than those of the parents of Dogherry, Mrs. Malaprop, and Mrs. Shillibeer. Shakspere's child was full of pompous humor; Sheridan's, of affectation; and Shillibeer's, of honest faith in her own pronunciation. We don't believe in the claim which another DOUBLE s, namely, Sidney Smith, has to the merit of Mrs. Partington's birth, although shovelling back the Atlantic with her broom was worthy of another's, our old friend Mother Shipton. It is difficult to judge of architecture from a brick, even though car- ried in the hat of an Editor; but as Dogherry is a regular BRICX himself, perhaps a few specimens may give an idea of his quality as exactly as reading the entire play of "Much Ado about Nothing."        ,                .  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7492-00000066"/> "8           CHT-OHAT. VERGES has a slight attack of the complaint (the natural result of ass- ociating with Dogherry) when he talks about " suffering salvation," but this incipient symptom is completely crushed by Dogherry's saying "that were a punishment too good for such villains;" and it is really dif- ficult, pending the Branch, ,Briggs, and Matsell inquiry, not to believe but -that Shakspeare had his prophetic eye on New York when he makes Dogherry inquire, "Who think you the most desartless men to be Consta- ble?"Pierce Pungent is afraid that Shakspere is at the bottom of all the police arrangements of Gothamn  When a man is really fond of this peculiar order of genius, whose writing and reading are considered va- nity, how gloriously he is told that consequently he is considered the most senseless and fit man to be Constable of the Watch. After this, he is commissioned " to comprehend all the vagrom men," and we are strongly of opinion that some of our judicial authorities might have saved themselves the annoyance of an indictment if they had called Shakspere to their aid, who advised them to "let all cul- prits escape, and thank God they had got rid of a knave." Allowing for the difference of tastes, how admirably Shakspere has hit off our New York Police, when he makes the SECOND WATCHMAN say, "We would rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a Watch," and could Solomon himself have given better advice than Dogherry does when he advises his policemen!" not to meddle with a drunken man till he is sober; and that the less he meddles with a thief, the betterfor his honesty." Surely our Chief of Police must have founded his system upon that of Dogherry, and hence the marvellous escapes of notorious criminals lately, who have been acquitted on the Shaksperean maxim of " always allowing a thief to steal out of their company." We must not, however, dwell too long upon Dogherry; we will, therefore, only request the public to remember how truly he realizes his own nature when he tells Verges to write him down an Ass. At-this' stage of Zoology, we leave our friend Dogherry, and introduce his daugh- ter Mrs. Malaprop, who makes a most creditable exhibition of her know- ledge when she affirms, that "Allegories grow on the banks of the Nile." "The Rivals" is full of Mrs. Malaprop's good things, and we refer to that for more of them, leaving only space for her daughter Partington, trusting that our readers may not think us as tedious as a King; which being "tolerable and not to be endured," naturally led the thirteen colonies in 1776 to throw off the yoke, which is thus proved to be a perfectly Shaksperean move.   OC I I T-o a I A T.          119 It ought to be understood, that a mere mis-pronunciation is not a joke. The wrong word must suggest an idea so grotesquely in antago- nism to the right thought, that the sense of humor, which exists in every man, should at once be taken by storm by it, as when Dogherry openly vows, he " wants a senseless and desartless man," in order to promote him. PIERCE PUNGENT, therefore, considers that two thirds of the Partington jokes are so far-fetched, that the cost of carrying them into print is far more than they are worth; still, there are a few which have the true ring in them, and vindicate their claim to the Dogherry family. Mrs. Partington offers this great distinction from the Shakspere and Sheri. dan blood, that she is fonder of quibbling than either of them; but this may be owing to the latitude and longitude, or else to the " parallax of centuries." This, however, is clear that the pun which turns upon such verbal or rather grammatical equivocation as that of Adam- and Eve, and their Tea Pot, is not of the true metal.- Nor is there any fun, that is, perceptible to us, in calling halibut haulabout. Here is the grand blunder of Mrs. Partington, that instead of laying her fun on very thick, as Shakspere did, she chooses to spread it like gold-leaf over a vast extent of territory, and, consequently, it is so very thin that it breaks. As a proof of the difference between these persons, we may mention that of Partington, who says that "poor old Mrs. Hays has TWO BUCKLES on her lungs"--and her regret that retirement or hermitage of the lungs kills, 'as well as " tonsors about the throat," saying nothing of her regret of the man who died from getting a tough bit of beef in his scarcofagus, which is worse than cutting his jocular vein. We   must, nevertheless, confess to a great admiration of her theolo- gical attainments when she openly says, that "Miss Prude is determined to monopolize all the religion she can, and much good may it do her." Pierce Pungent feels that selfishness never was better hit off, for we know that PIETY disagrees with all persons as terribly as mince pie-ty does with children in Christmas-time. Possibly, her offer to send a Turkey to Russia, to put an end to the war, rather than they should fight about it, is rather of the Punch or- der than the Partington; but sh8 so clearly carries out the notion by bringing in the Ostriches, and the Rushing Bears-saying nothing of the Ice-Cremian Tartars at Sebastopol; for, as she confesses, there is a great difference between sea bass to pull, and having to pull SEA BASS, although perhaps our friend C. Bass of Laura Keene's Varieties may object to being pulled. ,               #   #  i    '                .  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7492-00000067"/> 120          O ITT-HAT. The Two Robins.--Many years Since, being at my country resi- dence, at Broomfield, in Somersetshire, I met with the following strange occurrence?--Attached to a house just opening into a pitched court- yard, is a room furnished with two windows, one of which is grated and open, and the other is glazed; through this open window, robins and other small birds were in the habit of passing into the room, which being generally undisturbed, and the door locked, afforded them an occasional refuge from the inclemency of the weather. At times you might see two robins, one of them being within, and the other without the room, pecking at each other, with the glazed window between them, and seemingly much amused with their play. One day in the summer time I had occasion to look for something in this room, and accompanied by one of my sons, I unlocked the door, with the intention of entering, when two robins, which were both within the apartment, being disturbed, fled out through the open grated window, and then making a circuit through the air, pitched together on the ground of the court on which we were standing, and at about ten yards' distance from us. They then, apparently, commenced a most furious fight with each  other,- and shortly one of them fell on his back, stretched out his legs, and seemed perfectly dead. The other instantly seized him by -the back of the head, and dragged ltim several times round and round a circle of about seven or eight feet in diameter. My son, with a view to stop their savage amusement, was about to spring forward, when I gently arrested him, to see the issue. Much to my astonishment, after being dragged a few rounds, the fallen and apparently dead bird sprang up with a bound, and his antagonist fell in his turn upon his back, and stretched out both legs, with consummate adroitness, in all the mock rigidity of death, and his late seemingly dead opponent, in like manner, seized him by the head, and after dragging him a few rounds in imita- tion of Achilles dragging Hector around the walls of Troy, they both sprang up and flew away. I have seen strange sights in my life, in which birds and beasts have been the actors, but none equal -to this. How little do we know of their habitudes, and more especially of those who sport together during the night, when their tyrant masters are at rest!

I!artin Luther's Wedding ing.--A correspondent of the -e York Times States that Lieut. D., an officer in the United States Navy recently met an aged German in a jeweller's shop, near Broadway, who had an old gold ring, which he offered for sale. The ring attracted the attention of Lieut. D., and he purchased it at an advance of its nominal value. On inspection it was found to be the wedding ring of Luther. It is in good condition, bearing little mark of chafing or extraordinary wear. It is by no means massive-but, on the contrary, slight and de licate in form. Previous to its being shaped to the finger, the plate was chased into a figure of th crucifixion, most delicately and beautifully wrought, so that the cross and the paraphernalia appertaining are disg tinctly visible. On the centre of the body of the Saviour is inserted a ruby. The inside of the ring bears this inscripti0n, in bold letters, in German Text:-"MAITIN LUTER,   CATIR   DE BORE,  13th Jan, 1525."              AN English gentleman possessing-a keen wit, was at a brilliant as- sembly of the elite at Vienna, where a distinguished lady of that city freluently amused herself and immediate circle of friends, by saying smart and uncourteous things to annoy him.

We shall quote the letter entire, as every line has interest: "Gore-house, January 29th, 1889. "MY DEAR MADAM,-Indisposition must plead my excuse for not having sooner given you the sad particulars I promised in my last; when that cause for my silence had subsided, the dangerous illness of Lord Canterbury threw me into such alarm and anxiety, that it is only to-day, when letters from Paris assure me that he is recovering, that I feel equal to the task of writing. "Poor, dear L. E. L. lost her father, who was a Captain in the army, while she was yet a nild. He had married the widow of an army agent, a woman not of refined habits, and totally unsuited to him, On his death, his brother, the late Dean of Exeter, interested himself for his nephew and niece, the sole children left by Captain Landon; and deeming it necessary to remove them from their mother, placed the girl (poor L. E. L.) at school, and the boy at anotheir. At an unusually early age she manifested the genius for which she afterwards became so deservedly popular. On leaving school, her uncle placed her under the protection of her grandmother, whose exigence rendered the life of her gifted grandchild anything but a happy one. Her first practical effusions were published many years ago, and the whole of the sum they produced was appropriated to her grandmother. "Soon after, L. E. L. became acquainted with Mr. --, who, charmed with her talents; encouraged their exertion by inserting her poems in a literary journal, with all the encomiums they merited. This notice 'drew the attention of publishers on her, and, alasI drew also the calumny and hatred of the envious, which ceased not to persecute her through her troubled life; but absolutely drove her from her native land. There was no slander too vile, and no assertion too wicked, to heap on the fame of this injured creature. Mr. --, a married man, and the father of a large family, many of whom were older than L. E. L., was said to, have been her lover, and it was publicly stated that she had become too intimately connected with him. Those who disbelieved- the calumny, refrained not from repeating it, until it became a general topic of conversation. Her own sex, fearful of censure, had not courage   OR IT-0HAT.             123 123 to defend her, and this highly gifted and sensitive creature, without having committed a single error, found herself a victim to slander More than one advantageous proposal of marriage was made to her; but no sooner was this known, than anonymous letters were sent to the persons who wished to wed her, filled with harges against her hon or. Some of her suitors, wholly discrediting these calumnies, but thinking it due to her to refute them, instigated inquiries to trace them to the original source whence they came; not a single proof could be had of even the semblance of guilt, though a thousand were furnished of per- feet innocence. Wounded and humiliated, poor L. . L refused to wed those who could, however worthy the motive, seem to doubt her honor, or instigate inquiry into her conduct; and, from year to year, dragged on a life of mortification and sorrow, Pride led her to conceal what she suffered, but those who best Snew her were aware that for many months sleep could only be obtained by the aid of narcotics, and that violent spasms and frequent attacks of the nerves left her seldom free from acute suffering. The effort to force a gaiety she was far from feel- ing, increased her sufferings, even to the last. The first use she made of the money produced by her writings, was to buy an annuity fo her grandmother-that grandmother, whose acerbity of temper and  weary- ing exigence had embittered her home. She     the n wen t to reside in Hans-Place, with some elderly ladies, wh o kep t a school, and here again calumny assailed her.

Beset by inquiries from all her friends as to where Mr. Maclean was?--when she was to be married? &amp;c. &amp;c.-all indicating a strong suspicion that he had heard the' reports, and would appear no more--a serious illness assailed her, and reduced her to the brink of the grave; when her -- wrote and demanded an explanation from Mr. Maclean. "He answered, that fearing the climate of Africa might prove fatal to her, he had abandoned the intention of marrying, and felt embarrassed at writing to say so. "She, poor soul tI mistook his hesitation and silence for generosity, and wrote to him a letter fraught with affection; the ill-starred union was again proposed, but on condition that it should be kept a secret even from the friends she was residing with. From the moment of his return from Scotland to that of their departure, he was moody, mysterious, and ill-hunmored-continually sneering at literary ladies-speaking slightingly of her works-and, in short, showing every symptom -of a desire to disgust her. Sir - remonstrated with her on his extraordi- nary mode of proceeding; so did all her friends; but the die was cast. Her pride shrunk from the notion of again having it said that another marriage was broken off; and she determined not to break with him. Mystery on mystery followed; no friend or relative of his-though an uncle and aunt were in London-sanctioned the marriage; nay more, it is now known that, two days previous to it, he, on being questioned by his uncle, denied positively the fact of his intention to be married. "The marriage was a secret one, and not avowed until a very few days previous to their sailing for Africa; he refused to permit her own maid, who had long served her, to accompany her, and it was only at the eleventh hour that he 'could be induced to permit a strange servant to be her attendant. His conduct on board ship was cold and moody; for her broken-hearted --, whom I have seen, told me that the cap- tain of the ship said that Mr. Maclean betrayed the utmost indifference towards her. This indifference continued at Cape Castle, .and what was worse, discontent, ill-humor, and reproaches at her ignorance of house- keeping met her every day, until, as she -writes- to her---, her nerves became so agitated,- that the sound of his voice made her tremble. She was required to do the work of a menial; her female servant was dis- charged, and was to sail the day that the hapless L. E. L. died. She has come to England. L. E. L. thus writes to her --:-'There are   IIc IT-OA[ T.           125 eleven or twelve chambers here empty, I am told, yet Mr. Maclean refuses to let me have one of them for my use, nor will he permit me to enter the bed-room from the hour I leave i, seven in the morning, until he quits it at one in the afternoon. He expects me to cook, wash, and iron; in short, do the work of a servant. I never see him until seven in the evening, when he comes to dinner; and when that is over, he plays the violin until ten o'clock, when I go to bed. He says he will never cease correcting me until he has broken my spirit, and com- plains of my temper, which you know was never, even under heavy trials, bad.' "This was the last account Mr.--- ever receive Judge, then of his wretchedness          everreceived   Judgethenof "It is now known that Mr. Maclean had formed a liaison at Cape Castle with a woman of that country, by whom he has a large family; such liaisons are not considered disreputable there, and the women are treated as wives. This person lived in the Castle as its mistress, until the arrival of Mr. Maclean and poor L. E L., when she was sent off up the country. This woman was the niece of one of the merchants who sat on the inquest All the servants, with the exception of the man and his wife brought out by I EF L., were the creatures of the former mis- tress. The whole of the female natives detest English women, because the presence of one there banishes them from the society where they are tolerated in their absence. "Mr. Maclean admits that indisposition and mental annoyance must haverendered him far from being a kind or agreeable companion to poor Letitia; but adds, that had she lived a little longer, she would have found him very different, as he was, when not ill and tormented by various circumstances which he does not explain, easy and good-tem- pered to a fault. He says, that never was there so kind or so faultless a being on earth as that poor, poor girl, as he calls her, and that he never knew her value until he had lost her. In fact, his letter seems an answer to charges preferred against him by the departed, and, what is strange, the packet that brought the fatal news br;ught no letter of recent date for her '---, though she never missed an opportunity, and they occurred rarely, of writing to him. Her letters, all of which have breathed the fondest affection for him, admit that she had little hope of happiness from her stern, cold, and morose husband.

We cull a few pas- sages from the most noticeable names. WALTE S AVAGE LANDOR. "I did not believe such kind things would be said of me for a centu- ry to come. Perhaps, before we meet, even fashionable persons will pronounce my name without an apology, and I may be patted on the head by dandies, with all the gloss on their coats, and unfrayed straps to their trousers." ' It occurs to me that authors are beginning to think it an honest thing to pay their debts; and that they are debtors to all by whose labor and charges the fields of literature have been cleared and sown. We have been a rascally gang hitherto. Few writers have said all the good they thought of others, and fewer have concealed the ill. They praise their friends, because their friends, it may be hoped, will praise them. As these propensities seem inseparable from the literary charac- ter, I have always kept aloof from authors where I could." "Southey stands erect, and stands alone. I love him no less for his integrity than his genius. , No man, in our days, has done -a twentieth part for the glory of literature." "The opium-eater calls Coleridge -the largest and most spacious intel- lect, the subtlest and most comprehensive, that has as yet existed among men. Impiety to Shakspeare I treason to Milton I I give up the -rest, even Bacon.  Certainly, since their day, we have seen nothing at all comparable to him Byron and Scott were but as gun-flints to a granite mountain.

If you do, I shall oly answer in the cries that you are likely to hear at, this moment from your window-Ground ivy I ground ivy I ground ivy 1" One would like to quote every line that Landor has written, but as that is impossible, we must content ourselves with plucking and setting down a stray thought here and there ; and refer the reader to the cor- respondence itself, where he may wander in a wilderness of thought which we must leave unexplored :- "Do not be angry with me for my sincerity as regards Byron. The bosom of Byron never could hold the urn in which the muse of Tragedy embalms the dead. There have been four magic poets in the world. We await, the fifth monarchy, and like the Jews with the Messiah, we shall not be aware of it till it comes." "The Rhine, exclusive of its castles and legends, will bear no compa- rison with the Lake of Como. It wants majestic trees, it wants Italian skies, it wants idleness and repose. The two most heavenly of heaven- ly things, the most illusory of illusions-- "'Most things are real to me except realities." "I detest the character of Rousseau, but I cannot resist his eloquence. He had more of it, and finer than any man. Demosthenes was a con- tracted heart, and even Milton's was vitiated by the sourness of theo- logy." "I have this instant sent your note to poor . It has made him very ill. He is about to publish a drama on the Deluge, on which he tells me he has been engaged for twenty years You cannot be surpris- ed that he is grievously and hopelessly afflicted, having had water on his brain so long." ",I find that Coleridge has lost the beneficent friend at whose house he lived.' George IV, the vilest wretch in Europe, gave him 100 a year. Enough in London, to buy three turnips and half an egg a day. Those men surely were the most dexterous of courtiers who resolved to show William that his brother was not the vilest, by dashing the half egg and three turnips from the plate of Coleridge. No such action as this is recorded of our administration in the British annals." "The author of the ' Arabian Nights' was the greatest benefactor the East ever had, not excepting Mahomet.

"I am sorry you sent my ' RxaTmination! by a private hand. I never in my life sent even a note by a private hand. Nothing affects me but pain and disappointment.  Hannah More says, ' There are no evils in the world but sin and bile.' They fall upon me very unequally, I would give a good quantity of bile for a trifle of sin, and yet my phi- losophy would induce me to throw it aside.

"When I was at Oxford, I wrote my opinion on the origin of the re- ligion of the Druids. It appeared to me that Pythagoras, who settled in Italy, had engrafted, on a barbarous and blood-thirsty region, the humane doctrine of the Metempsychosis. It would have been vain to say, Do not murder.  No people ever minded this doctrine; but. he frightened the savages by saying, if you are cruel even to beasts and in- sects, the cruelty willfall upon yourselves; you shall be the same." "{ Pardon me smiling at your expression, going to the root of the evil. This is always said about the management of Ireland. Alas I the root of the evil lies deeper than the centre of the earth." "The surface of Wordsworth's mind-the poetry-has a good deal of staple about it, and will bear handling; but the inner, the conversa- tional and private, has many coarse, intractable, dangling threads, fit -only for the flock-bed equipage of grooms. I praised him more before I knew more of him, else I never should; and I might have been unjust to the better part had I remarked the worse sooner.

Picture of Elizabeth B. Browning.-- MrS Browning is in many respects the correlative of her husband. As he is full of manly power, so she is a type of the most sensitive and delicate womanhood. She has been a great sufferer from ill-health, and the marks of pain are stamped upon her person and manner. Her figure is slight, her countenance ex- pressive of genius and sensibility, shaded by a veil of long brown locks; and her tremulous voice often flutters over her words, like the flame of a dying candle over the wick. I have never seen a human frame which seemed so nearly a transparent veil for a celestial and immortal spirit She is a soul of fire inclosed in a shell of pearl  Her rare and fine ge- nius needs no setting forth at my hands. She is also, what is not so generally known, a woman of uncommon, nay, profound learning, even measured by a masculine standard. Nor is she more remarkable for genius and learning than for sweetness of temper, tenderness of heart, depth of feeling, and purity of spirit. It is a privilege to know such beings singly and separately, but to see their powers quickened, and their happiness rounded, by the sacred tie of marriage, is a cause for peculiar and lasting gratitude. A union so complete as theirs-in which the mind has nothing to crave nor the heart to sigh for-is cordial to behold and soothing to remember. Waiving the Subject.-A friend of ours, who is a great Sabbat- "arian," and who enjoys, nevertheless, an airing along the musical seashore, says he loves to see the sea calm on a Sunday, he is so unfond of seeing "Sabbath "- breakers." 6*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7492-00000072"/> 180            H IT-O  AT. The Necessity of Reflection.-It is obvious that the most useful information, the most important instruction will pass readily from the mind, unless the reflective faculties render its impression lasting, and its operation effectual Without the exercise of reflection the mind would be speedily encumbered, not only with what is useless, but pernicious. Reflection may be termed the digestive or 'ssimilatinE principle of the mind, and unless its legitimate operation be allowed the tone of its health and vigor will become impaired, and it will be disqualified, both for happiness and usefulness. The Value of the Young Mind.-It should never be forgotten that it is the young mind in which the principles of virtue will most easily and deeply take root; and, while the thoughts are fresh and the feelings tender, they will entwine themselves around its undecaying beauty and loveliness. It is proverbial, that it is the tender sapling not the sturdy tree, which can be trained to elegance and usefulness. IN the multitude of words, there will be some folly, something that may rather weary and offend than delight and improve. The evil of over-speaking usually comes from an overweening opinion of self Unchastened and unsubdued self is fond of its own display, although it can display nothing. ]Hypocrites.--'Tis not that the hypocrite despises a good charac ter, that he is not one himself, but because he thinks he can purchase i at a cheaper rate than the practice of it, and thus obtain, all the applause of a good man merely by pretending to be so. Society--Those can most easily dispense with society who art most calculated to adorn it; they only are dependent on it who posses -no mental resources; for though they bring nothing to the general mart like beggars, they are too poor to stay at home. KNOWLEDGE will not be acquired without pains and application. I is troublesome and deep digging for pure waters; but when you onec come to the springs, they rise up and meet you.

Let us not dispute with any one concerning the reality of their sufferings; it is with sorrows as with countries--each man has his own. THERE are some people well enough disposed to be grateful, but they cannot hit upon it without a prompter: they must be taught to be thankful, and it is a fair step if we can but bring them to be willing and only offer at it. HE who wishes to comprehend the present, and understand the future, must take his lesson from the past, for it is there that he finds the roots of the present, and the germs of the future. Government.-The surest way of wisely governing both a private family and a kingdom, is for a husband and a prince to yield at certain times something of their prerogative. Suggestion.-"Do you know what made my voice so melodious i" said a celebrated vocal performer, of awkward manners, to Charles Bannister. "No," replied the other. Why, then, rll tell you; when I was about fifteen, I swallowed, by accident, some train oil."  "I don't think,"'rejoined Bannister, "( it would have done you any harm if, at the same time, you had swallowed a dancing-master."

Then they will begin ' along- shore;' then up over the tops of the White Mountains,-up the valley of the Mohawk; and bo on along the Lakes and down the Mississippi, until at last a solemn chime from a thousand steeples, call awhole nation to come up and thank God for the blessings of the .past year-a grand chant of sacred music such as Beethoven and Handel never dreamed of."] The Bells I the Bells I the Nation's Bells  Oh, joyously their anthem swells; At Plymouth's rock they startle first; And now on Allegany burst: And now they wake Ohio's calm; And now they stir the Southern palm; Hurrah I Not o'er one State alone the music swells- Hark! the whole Union shakes beneath the Bells I The Bells I the Bells I the grand old Bells I Majestical their anthem swells; It mingles with Niagara's roar; It breaks on California's shore, And thanks the God who'guards our clime, And plenty gave, in every chime.

We were scrambling up the mountain, through a thick jungle of bushes and low trees, which rises above the east shore of the Dead Sea, when I saw before me a fine plum-tree, loaded with fresh blooming plums. I cried out to my fellow traveller, "Now, then, who will arrive first at the plum-tree?" and as he caught a glimpse of so refreshing an object, we both pressed our horses into a gallop to see which would get the first plum from the branches. We both arrived at the same moment; and, each snatching at a fine ripe plum, put it at once into our mouths, when, on biting it, instead of the cool, delicious, juicy fruit which we expected, our mouths were filled with a dry, bitter dust, and we sat under the tree upon our horses, sput- tering and hemming, and doing all we could to be relieved from the nauseous taste of this strange fruit. We then perceived, and to my great delight, that we had discovered the famous apple of the Dead Sea, the existence of which has been canvassed and doubted since the days of Strabo and Pliny, who first described it. Many travellers have given descriptions of other vegetable. productions which bear analogy to the one described by Pliny; but, up to this time, no one had met with the thing itself, either upon the spot mentioned by the ancient authors or elsewhere. WILLIAM  AGINN, LL D. OF that wonderful genius, and classic know-everything, Maginn, we find the following gossip in Jerdan's autobiography.  He was, perhaps, the most versatile writer in the language. But his genius was not con- fined to the English, but sparkled over the Greek and Latin and French, and almost every ancient and modern tongue, with a brilliancy and faithfulness astounding: "Of Maginn the precocious, the prolific, the humorous, the eccentric, the erratic, the versatile, the learned, the wonderfully endowed, the Irish, -how shall I attempt to convey an idea B There is hardly any species of literature in which he has not left examples as masterly as any in the language.

De Mirecourt, who is writing the history of his literary French contemporaries, gives some of them the credit of having very eccentric habits. Scribe, he says, rises at five every morning, and works till noon without any- interval. Balzac retired to rest every evening at six, rose at midnight, and wrote till nine in the morning, and after breakfasting resumed his pen till three, when a walk of two hours, and dinner at five, brought him again to his bed- time. Alfred de Musset, when asked for " copy " for the Revue des Deux Mondes, would say, "Send me fifty francs and a bottle of brandy, or you will have none."

' DuRNsa the summer, some years ago, an old Quadroon woman came up to the office of one of our hotels rather late one night, when the clerk accosted her with:- "Well, aunty, what do you want " "I'se come to lay out the man in No. 41," replied the old woman. "No. 41!" said the clerk, "you must be mistaken, there is nobody dead here. No. 41 only ate his supper a little while ago." "Go way, massa," said the Quadroon; " don't fool wid me, you know I an't going to tell the people dar is anybody dead in dis house. Make one ob your waiters show me de room." "Well," said the clerk, who was always in for a bit of fun, "here, Tom, show this woman up to number 41."  Tom obeyed and showed her to the room. It being very warm, the door and window were both open, and a candle burning in the grate threw a dim light round the room, giving it that appearance which the apartment of the sick generally presents. The white sheet which was thrown over the supposed corpse filled up the picture, and gave assurance to the old Quadroon woman that all was right. The waiter having left her, she took a candle and approach- ed the bedside. No. 41 happened to be a man of very pale complexion, and breathed almost imperceptibly. The old woman having taken a hurried glance, proceeded to get the washbowl and towel, and filling the former with water, she placed it on a chair, near the bedside. Dipping the towel in the bowl, she said, "I guess de gemman won't want shabin' by de look ob him smooth chin," and swashing the wet towel over his face, she proceeded to wash him. "What the thunder are you about " exclaimed the supposed corpse, rising up in bed. "Who the   are you, and what are you doing here?"The Quadroon screamed in- her fright, overturning the chair and washbowwL "Why, I come'here to lay you out, massa," said the woman, recover- ing from her fright, " bress de Lord, you hab come to life." "Lay me outl" exclaimed the astonished No. 41. "If you don't leave here, you old hag, I will lay you out, to a certainty " And seizing a boot, he made evident demonstrations of putting this threat into execution, whilst the old woman rushed down stairs, and running against 'couple of waiters, tumbled them over very uncere- moniously.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7492-00000076"/> '138          OHT-OHAT.

Worth lPeacdmg.-Yet every lite, however wealk, has something ii it which may teach, either as a warning or a model. It is only in the lives of others, not in our own, that we can study human life as , whole--our own life is fragmentary. We pass blindfold into each sue cessive moment with trembling volition, knowing not what the dictun of our decision may bring forth. Clear vision comes only when it is toc late, and we see then how error and misery came of egoism and blin passion. But in biography, if uttered truly, we trace clearly the in separable connexion between weakness and suffering, error and punish ment, sin and remorse; and we start back warned from the same fata path. While, on the other hand, the records of courage will strength en, and earnestness inspire, long after the heroes or martyrs have beei laid low in their graves. And thus it is that the hands of the dea guide us best through the future A Model Boudoir.--At Mountjoy Forest she found her private sitting-room hung with crimson silk velvet, trimmed with gold. At theie hotel in Paris, the reception-rooms were fitted up with crimson satin and gold. Gold, and marble, and mirrors, abounded everywhere. But he: ladyship's bed-room and dressing-ropm was "a surprise of splendor prepared for her by her gallant husband " (to use her own words). The bed was silvered in place of gilt, and rested on the back of two large silver swans. It was placed in a recess, lined with fluted white silk while pale blue silk curtains, lined with white, fell from the frieze which was supported by columns at each side. A silvered sofa, resting on a velvet carpet of pale blue, rich coffers for jewels and India shawls a silver lamp, and all the ornaments silvered, complete the picture The dressing-room had hangings of blue silk, covered with lace, and the furniture was all silvered like the bed.

OHT-OHAT.             189 Interpretation of Dreams.-There is a new guide to the interpre- tation of dreams. An English paper thus puts it; --To dream of -a millstone round your neck, is a sign of what you may expect if you get an extravagant wife.' To see apples in a dream, betokens a wedding, because where you find apples you may reasonably expect to find pears. To dream that you are lame is a token that you will get into a hobble. When a young lady dreams of a coffin, it betokens that she should instantly discontinue lacing her stays tightly, and always go warmly and thickly shod in wet weather. If you dream of a clock, it is a token that you will gain credit-that is-tick. To dream of a fire is a sigh that if you are wise you will see that the lights in your house are out before you go to bed. To dream that your nose is red at the tip is an intimation that you had better leave off brandy and water. To dream of walking bare-footed denotes a journey that you will make bootless. Popping the Question.-Although ancient custom sanctioned the observance of Leap Year in allowing ladies th " pop the question," we doubt whether many will in the present day avail themselves of the privilege. Questions of this kind should properly proceed from the other side. Toothache-A remedy for the toothache is as follows:-Alum, reduced to an impalpable powder, two drachms; nitrous spirit of ether seven drachms Mix, and apply them to the tooth. Books.--The moral advantages arising out of the love of books are so obvious, that to enlarge upon such a topic might be deemed a gratuitous parade of truism. Lord Bacon says, with his usual discri. mination, "Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested." This short sentence comprises the whole practical wisdom of the subject, and by an extension of the principle, the choice of a library must be regulated. "Few books, well selected, are best," is a maxim useful to all, but more especially to young collectors of a library.

WHY might I say, and truly, that BULWER is a plagiarist and a rob- bert  Because he sent "My Novel" to the publishers, sold it, and pocketed the price thereof. WHEN a young man confidently tells you that. such and such a young lady " has no heart," you may be sure that he has been trying it on, and has failed in making a favorable impression. "CHILDREN," says Mrs. Grant, "are first vegetable, and then they are animal, and sometimes come to be people." But it is sad enough to see how few nowadays get beyond the second stage.

C IT-OHAT.             141 Habits of the late Czar.--The habits of the late Czar are said to have been ostentatiously simple, dramatically soldier-like. The luxuries on his table were not for him. His military form was but upon rare occasions to be seen inclosed within a covered carriage. His industry was as- remarkable as his temperance; to inspect fortresses and review army corps he would travel days and nights. He was a devourer of newspapers, not of the few feeble reactionary journals published in free countries-those he despised-but of such newspapers as he well knew represented the independence and intelligence of the communities where they were produced. A list of the newspapers which the Emperor daily scanned might possibly astonish some persons. The Emperor's death was sudden and unexpected; and such sudden and unexpected fatalities have been too frequent in the line of Romanoff not to suggest grounds of unfavorable suspicion. Four princes have worn the imperial crown of Russia in much less than a century between the death of Peter the Great and the accession of Alexander, viz between the years 1725 and 1801. The following are their names and respective fates:- Peter II. deposed in 1727. Ivan VI. deposed in 1750, murdered in 1762. Peter III. murdered in 1762. Paul, muirdered in 1801. Of four Emperors, one was deposed and three were murdered within 76 years. Facts for the Curious.--Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both died on the 4th of July, 1826. John Adams died in his 91st year, and was eight years older than Thomas Jefferson; Thomas Jefferson was I eight years older than James Madison; James Madison was eight years older than James Monroe; James Monroe was eight years older than John Quincy Adams. The first five of our Presidents-all revolutionary men-ended their terms of service in the 66th year of their age. Washington, born February 22d, 1732; inaugurated 1789; term   of service expired in the 66th year of his age: John Adams, born October 19th, 17365; inaugurated 1797; term of-service expired in the 66th year of his age: Thomas Jefferson, born April 21st, 1743; inaugurated 1801; term of service expired in the 66th year of his age: James Madison, born March 4th, 1751; inaugurated 1809; term of service expired in the 66th year of his age: James Monroe, born April 2nd, 1769; inau- gurated 1817; term of service expired in the 66th year of his age.  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7492-00000078"/> "2           OHT-HA T. Technical Observations.--A few days ago, a couple of men got into a fight, and as a consequence, it being naturally the case, a ring of excited individuals got around the parties, and each, according to his own feelings in the matter, gave his advice. "Peg it into him," said the shoemaker; " hammer his upper leather for him-that's it I wax him, my lad-beat his sole out of him" "Cut into his fat, old fel," said the butcher; "knock him on the head. Say! why don't yer punch his ribs? You're a regular calf, you are I Knuckle him, now yer got him, and make mince meat of him." "Dress him well," said the tailor; "see how he pants; felt him; give him a stitch in his ribs; button up his lip, and knock him bang Tan his hide," said the currier; "peel the bark off his nose-and damage his skin." "This suits me exactly," said the lawyer; " get his head in chancery, and bleed him till he pleads, and then he's a good case." Then advanc- ing to the other one, he said, "He's doing you an injury ; he's perfectly ferocious-; take the law on him, and I'll look out for the remainder." "I saw him strike you first," said the carpenter. "Nail him  Knock his uprights from under him; cross-cut him until he lies dormant. I'll bet a basket of shavings on you, old chap." "Plug him in the eye," said the tobacconist. "Get a double twist on him, and then chaw him up. Don't let him stump you; give him one on his nigger-head." "What's the row?" said the police, coming up after every one had gone. "Show us a chance to have a grabat somebody." AN old fellow, who became weary of his life, thought he might as well commit suicide, but he didn't wish to go without forgiving all his enemies. So at the last moment, he removedlthe noose from his neck, saying to himself: "I never can or will forgive old Noah for letting the copperhead snakes get into the ark. They have killed $2000 worth of my cattle, and when he and I meet there'll be a general fuss." AN expeditious mode of getting up a row is to carry a long ladder on your shoulders in a crowded thoroughfare, and every few minutes turn round to see if any one is making a face at you.   CHT-CHAT.              143 RESULTS. OF A BROWN STUDY. WHAT is earthly happiness I that phantom of which we hear so much and see so little; whose promises are constantly given and constantly broken, but as constantly believed; that cheats us with the sound instead of the substance, and with the blossom instead of the fruit. Like Juno, she is a goddess in pursuit, but a cloud in possession, deified by those who cannot enjoy her, and despised by those who can. Anti- cipation is her herald, but disappointment is her companion; the first addresses itself to our imagination, that would believe, but the latter to our experience, that must. Happiness, that grand mistress of the cere- monies in the dance of life, impels us through all its mazes and meander- ings, but leads none of us by the same route. Arnstippus pursued her in pleasure, Socrates in wisdom, and Epicurus in both; she received the attentions of each, but bestowed her endearments on neither; although, like some other gallants, they all boasted of more favors than they had received. Warned by their failure, the stoic adopted a most paradoxi- cal mode of preferring his suit; he thought, by slandering, to woo her; by shunning, to win her; and proudly presumed, that, by fleeing her, she would turn and follow him. She is deceitful as the calm that pre- cedes the hurricane: smooth as the water on the verge of the cataract, and beautiful as the rainbow, that smiling daughter of the storm; but like the mirage in the desert, she tantalizes us with a delusion that dis- tance creates and that contiguity destroys. Yet, when unsought, she is often found, and when unexpected, often obtained; while those who seek for her the most diligently, fail the most, because they seek her where she is not. Anthony sought her in love; Brutus in glory;- Cwesar in dominion. The first found disgrace, the second disgust, the last ingra- titude, and each destruction. To some she is more kind, blt not less cruel; she hands them her cup, and they drink even to stupefaction, until they doubt whether they are men, with Philip, or dream that they are gods, with Alexander. On some she smiles, as on Napoleon, with an aspect more bewitching than an Italian sun; but it is only to make her frown the more terrible, and by one short caress to embitter the pangs of separation. Yet she is, by universal homage and consent a queen; and the passions are the vassal lords that crowd her court, await her mandate, and move at her control. But like other mighty sovereigns, she is so surrounded by her envoys, her officers, and her ministers of state, that it is extremely difficult to be admitted to her presence-chamber, or to have any immediate communicatibn with her-  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7492-00000079"/> "4           OHT-OHAT. sell Ambition, Avarice, Love, Revenge-all these seek her, and her alone; alas I they are neither presented to her, nor will she come to them. She despatches, however, her envoys unto them--mean and poor representatives of their queen. To Ambition she sends Power; to AvariceWealth; to Love' Jealousy; to Revenge Remorse. Alas! what are these, but so many names for vexation or disappointmentl Neither is she to be won by flatteries or by bribes; -she is to be gained by waging war against her enemies, much sooner than by paying any particular court to herself Those who conquer her adversaries will find that they need not go to her; for she will come to them.

May my particular misfortune be the little seed from which shall spring a birch-tree, big enough to whip all feminine creation into the path of duty. Like most other reformers, my mind has been led to a consideration of the magnitude of the'general evil, by having had a pretty bitter taste of it in my individual lot. Now, understand me, good reader. I do not say that my wife is not a good wife in most respects. She is an excellent little woman--a woman of superior sense and judgment; and as such, is very much attached to me, and thoroughly appreciates my character. She is a very attentive listener whenever I talk upon uncommon subjects, or read aloud any remarkable leader from the newspapers. As I am a great politician, she takes an interest in -politics, and enters into all my views; and it is charming to see the passion she will get into whenever my speeches in the vestry are badly reported. Besides this, she manages the house very well, and does not look as black as a thunder- cloud if I happen to bring in half a dozen friends unexpectedly to din. ner, when there is nothing but a leg of mutton. Then she deserves great credit for her method of bringing up the children, who are decidedly the best behaved I ever saw in my life. Yes, I do not deny that, in many respects, my wife does her duty thoroughly; but-she does not. sew on my shirt-buttons. I can neither coax nor scold her into remembering the matter at the right time. She always says, "Oh, I am very sorry, I quite forgot it;" or, "Well, I never heard of a man who pulls his buttons off at: the rate you- do I It must be done on pur- pose." It was only last month I really lost a capital stroke of business by the want of one of these confounded, beggarly buttons. I went down upon an important affair to Liverpool, to meet a man at nine o'clock the next morning, and was to decide upon a purchase that, if made in time, would secure'me a neat hundred. I was called at eight. Everything I wanted was ready to my hand, for my wife had packed my carpet-bag with her usual care-razors, brushes, my own peculiar soap, clean linen, and all odd minutiae were there. "Good creature she is 1" thought I. "She really is worth her weight in gold;" and I was far gone in a meditation on the economy and convenience of matrimony, when I came to a halt suddenly--" a change came o'er the spirit of my dream." My right hand held between its thumb and forefinger the but- tonless wristhand of the left sleeve. Dismayed, I seized the .other wristhand; there was a button, indeed, but in the last stage of anatomy -one that would not survive a thrust through its destined hole. I   cHT -   AT-.          149 made a desperate dash at my throat, and (crowning point of misery 1) my fingers grasped a wretched button that hung by a thread, which they actually lost the power to snap. You might have knocked me down with that button. As I threw myself on a chair, my eye fell on the watch. Five minutes to nine Shades of Cresus I Great Plutus, hearl I rang the bell furiously. I demanded a chambermaid, with needle, cotton, and buttons, immediately. "Yes, sir; did I not want breakfast!" "Nol no no  Buttons, and a being that can sew them on." Whole centuries did it seem to me, while that young woman kept me waiting. She came at last; and whole decades did it seem while she was operating upon my luckless shirt with her clumsy fingers. I sat like a martyr. Solemnly do I protest that I do not know whether that young woman was pretty or not; though, in sewing the final but- ton on the collar, her face was close enough for me to see (near-sighted as I am) that there was a lurking devil of fun in her eye. Once she gave me a slight prick with her needle, and when I started she begged my pardon, adding, that it was " ill-conweniency to have the button sewed after a gentleman had put on his shirt"I groaned; it was ten minutes past nine. In vain I hurried through the rest of my toilet; in vain I rushed- like the north wind to my rendezvous: I was too late, and a more punctual fellow got my bargain. Since then, my wife has never been allowed to forget that hundred pounds lost; and she does seem a little ashamed. I told the story to a young friend of mine who has lately married, and whom I warned at the beginning of his matri- monial career as to the importance of buttons to his shirts Our friend laughed outright, and said that he and his Fanny had come to a split on that subject already, as I should see, if I would give them the pleasure of my company to an early supper that evening. It was to be a gen- tleman's party, and to consist entirely of married men. My wife did not approve of my going, but I went nevertheless. Never shall I for- get what I saw and heard that evening. I found my friend surrounded by half a dozen other friends, all in the act of sewing buttons on shirts, while his wife sat, in high glee, laughing at them. "Here comes another!" they all cried out, as I entered. "Now D--, my good fellow," said my host, addressing me, and taking up another shirt out of a basket beside him, " sit you down here, and sew the button on that collar." "What's the joke f" asked I, very much amazed "It is no joke at all," said he; "but a very-serious matter.

' Here Mrs. --'s merry laugh attracted my attention, and looking minutely at her, I thought she did not look quite so pleased as she pre- tended to be. :"What does all this absurd scene mean?"I inquired of her. "Why, Mr. D.," she replied with an arch smile, "I think it originates with you" "With me, my dear madam 1" "Yes. You must know that Harry has complained that his buttons are not sewed on properly, and has teased me most unmercifully about woman's duties. This morning he told me that you were always ' great' on the subject of shirt-buttons, and that he had no doubt your wife was a pattern of precision in that matter. Now, he called on you this morning, and you told him to play me this trick; did you not " "I I my dear madam I Why, I only told him a story of my wife's unpardonable negligence about my buttons, and what I lost by it." She looked rather relieved, and glancing at her husband with a smile, in which there was as much affection as fun, she said, "Well, he came home and said you had told him how he could shame me into sewing on his buttons. You had advised him to invite a party of gentlemen (persons with whom I wished to stand welD and that, on their arrival, he was to be discovered with a pile of clean shirts before him, dili- gently sewing on the buttons; and when asked why he was employed in that extraordinary manner, he was to tell them that I never would do it, and, therefore, he was obliged to do it himself after business. He vowed he would -do this on your recommendation, and you see he has done it." "My recommendation I My dear Mrs. --, I beg you to believe"- Here Fanny and her husband laughed heartily; and at last the latter explained that he was the inventor of the joke, which he had intended as a punishment to his wife. "Come, my dear Harry," said Fanny, " you had better all of you lay aside your unaccustomed tools, and come to supper. You have no idea how supremely awkward you all look," and she led the way into the supper-room. As we went down stairs I heard Harry say to one of his friends, "That stroke will tell double. My Fanny will take the hint, and use her needle in future; and D-- will learn not to make such a tremendous fuss as he does about a button more or less."   HUIT-OHAT.               161 Harry is mistaken: I. have not learned yet to take the want of a but- ton quietly. As the only source of discord between my wife and myself is this one of shirt-buttons, I am determined to try and remove it. Private remonstrance is unavailing; the thing occurred again this morning, and now I am resolved to effect a radical reform all over the country. My present object is to form an Anti-Buttonless Shirt League and to agitate the question in every legal way. We will have monster husband meetings at Exeter Hall, that stronghold of female benevolence, where the wives of England will be addressed by Irs. Ellis on the sub- ject. It shall be proved to them that it is a just demand we make. We merely ask, at first, " a fair amount of buttons for a day-shirt." Afterwards, we will assert our right to a due number for our " nightly wearing." In fact, dear reader, this is a question that ought to become national, since it comes home to every man's bosom. I am   so convinced of the great prevalence of this evil, and of the strong feeling of discontent which it has produced, that I entertain no doubt that these few words, feeble as they are to " reach the height of this great argument," will be like the little match which fires a train of gun- powder. HER VOICE, THEE's music over-floating round my brain, Breaking its ripples on my anxious ears; That, like a sceptic, hearing heavenly strains, For the first time honors the grand truth he hear: There is a dreamy joyance in the sound, A cheering warble, as of birds at noon, While all are on a saddened cadence wound; Making a beaded rosary of tune l My soul uptakes it in its misty hands, And counting out the tuneful beads in prayer, Roams through the cloisters of' its thought, and stands A willing holocaust to music there I It longs to leave the body on the notes, And wander upward, as on sounding wings; Yet sighs to think, when it in music floats, It cannot thank her who the glory brings.

"I(GHTNING AND AMBER. Electrol t was the Greek name for amber, and Electricity was the epithet by which Thales and his disciples distinguished the spirit they had learned to raise. We have o10st the history, if one ever existed, of the progress made in tracking out this wonderful spirit in its devious workings and wanderings; we only know that for nearly two thousand years this fact remainied barren of all results, and that the mystery in amber was regarded as one of the unknown things which are dreamt of in our philosophy Eventually an English dreamer, a pensioner of the Charterhouse, called Stephen Gray, in 1720, informed the world that something of the mystery of electricity he had solved; and he showed that the same spirit which dwelt in amber was also found in glass, hair, silk, and feathers. Twenty years passed, and some ingenious men at Leyden thought they could devise a plan for eliminating this spirit of the amber, and of collecting and retaining it when once developed. A large glass globe was fixed on an axis, and turned rapidly; a gun-barrel, suspended by silken strings, was hung near it, a wire fastened to the gun-barrel dropping into a glass of water at the other end. The glass globe was excited, as old Thales excited his amber, by friction with the hands; and the person holding the glass of water, upon applying his finger to obtain the spark from the barrel, received a shock, which convinced the terrified experimenters that the spirit was a giant in its wrath. The most exaggerated statements were published in all the large cities of Europe. The glass globe and the Leyden vial, as it was called, were exhibited in Paris and London, and cro s of spectators flocked to witness the discharge and to feel the 1" fearful' shock. The spirit of the amber was now fairly developed, and its powers were examined by experiment, guided by the new ideas. Men no longer used thought as the only element in the discovery of knowledge; they had begun to employ their senses and to cultivate habits of observation. At length, a great single-minded man, who had made his home "In lcwds which echo further west Than the Greeks' island of the blest," seeing through some of the mystery which enveloped this subtile spirit in amber, resolved on determining by an experiment, beautiful in its simplicity and grand in its danger, the relation which tit bore to the awful spirit of the thunder-storm.   CHT-CHAT.             163 The sculptor has idealized the noble form of the impious Ajax defying the lightning: how much more dignified would be a statue of the philosopher compelling the thunder of the heavens to speak aloud its secrets. Benjamin Franklin stood forth from among men in the bold- ness of his views, and he saw, or thought he saw, in the attractive principle of electron, a power of universal diffusion, and he resolved to examine for himself He had previously made himself acquainted with the laws by which electricity appeared to be guided, and availing him- self of this knowledge, Franklin devised his grand experiment. He mounted a kite into the air, insulated its string, which served as a conductor, and waited to see the result. For some time he waited in vain, the evocator received no answer to his call, the spirit refused to obey his summons. But when man calls on nature in the purity of his soul, and solicits earnestly a development of natural truths, nature rarely fails to vouchsafe a reply. Franklin stood watching his arrangement; presently every fibre of his kite-string was seen to stand on end, and, on applying a pointer to the ball to which it was attached, he was saluted with a discharge of electric fire of precisely the same character as that which had been previously developed from resin and from glass. Here we had a modern Prometheus, indeed, stealing fire from heaven., Thus it was proved that lightning was only a grand manifestation of the same phe- nomena which had first excited the attention of Thales of Miletus. The danger incurred by the illustrious Franklin was Boon fatally proved by the death of a continental philosopher, who repeated his experiment. Professor Rickmann had reared high in air an electrical conductor, and connected it with some, experimental arrangements in his study Proceeding without sufficient caution, the discharge from a passing thunder-cloud flowed through the conductor, and penetrating the body of the philosopher, destroyed his life. Further researches in the same direction confirmed the great result of Benjamin Franklin. Consultation of Physicians.-A man much addicted to drinking, being extremely ill with a fever, a consultation was held in his bed- chamber, by three physicians, how to " cure the fever and abate the thirsty "' Gentlemen," said he, "I will take half the trouble off your hands: you cure the fever, and I will abate the thirst myself." 7'  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7492-00000084"/> 154          O  I T -C H A T MCH.-Pat, my honey, when we take ould Ireland, it'll be some share you'd like to have?

I am fond of the English, and have much cause to be grateful to them, and I will do it with as little bloodshed as possible." He added, "I shall be killed by a musket ball in the streets of London."

Got any change!" THE term Infantry, applied to foot-soldiers, takes its origin from one of the infantas of Spain, who, hearing that the army commanded by her father had been defeated by the Moors, assembled a body of foot-soldiers, and with them engaged and defeated the enemy. In memory of this event, and to distinguish the foot-soldiers, who were not before held in much consideration, they received the name of infantry. Spare Moments.-A lean, awkward boy came one morning to the door of the Principal of a celebrated school, and asked to see him. The servant eyed his mean clothes, and thinking he looked more like a beg- gar than anything else, told him to go round to the kitchen Entrance. The boy did as he was bidden, and soon appeared at the back door. "I should like to see Mr. -.," he repeated          [ , You want a breakfast, more like," said the servant-girl, " and I can give you that without troubling him." "Thank you," said the boy, "I should have no objection to a bit of bread; but I should like to see Mr. B., if he can see me." "Some old clothes, may be, you want," remarked the servant, again eyeing the boy's patched trowsers. "I know he has none to spare;" and without regarding the boy's request, she went away about her ,work. "Can I see Mr. B.!" again asked the boy, after finishing his bread and butter. "Well, he's in the library; if he must be disturbed, he must; but ,i  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7492-00000085"/> 156           OHT-OHAT. he does like to be alone sometimes," said the girl in a peevish tone. She seemed to think it very foolish to admit such an ill-looking fellow into her master's presence; however, she wiped her hands, and bade him follow. Opening the library door, she said:--"Here's somebody, sir, who is dreadful anxious to see you, and so I let him in." I don't know how the boy introduced himself, or how he opened his business, but I know that after talking awhile, the Principal put aside the volume which he was studying, and took up some Greek books, and began to examine the new-comer. The examination lasted some time. Every question which the Principal asked, the boy answered as readily as could be. "' Upon my word," exclaimed the Principal, looking at the boy from head to foot over his spectacles, " you certainly do well. Why, my boy, where did you pick up so much ".-"In my spare moments," an- swered the boy. Here he was, a poor, hard-working boy, with but few opportunities for schooling, yet almost fitted for college by simply improving his spare moments. Truly, are not spare moments "the gold dust of time?" How precious they should be! What account can you give of your spare moments I What can you show for them I Look and see. This boy can tell you how very much :can be laid up by improving them; and there are many, many other boys, I am afraid, in the jail, in the house of correction, in the forecastle of a whale ship, in the tippling shop, who, if you should ask them when they began their sinful courses, might answer, "In my spare moments." Temptation always hunts you out in small seasons like these, when you are not busy; he gets into your hearts, if he possibly can, in just such gaps. There he hides himself, planning all sorts of mischief. Take care of your spare momenta. A vEBY remarkable tree was many years ago discovered growing on the Island of Ferro, or Hiero, one of the Canaries. The island is a dry and barren spot, affording no water except what is supplied in a sur- prising manner by the Fountain Tree, which grows there, and distils water from its leaves in such plenty, as to answer all the purposes of the inhabitants. This tree, according to the history of the Canary Islands, is the only dependence the natives have. One of a similar kind is said to be on the Island of St. Thomas, in the Gulf of Guinea.

THE slaves of the South, when they wish to-be severe on each other, say, "Go 'long, half-price nigger; you wouldn't fetch fifty dollars, and I'se wof a thousand." A RECENT writer asserts, that the less a man knows, the wider he wears his mouth open. He says, "It is as impossible for an ignoramus to keep his jaws closed as it is for a sick oyster to keep his shell closed." A DUTCHMAN being called upon to help pay for a lightning rod for the village church, towards the building of which he had liberally sub- scribed, exclaimed: "I have helped to build a house to de Lort, and if he chooses to donder on it, and knock it down, he musht do it at his own risk." AT a public garden in the suburbs of London, a waiter, observing one of his master's customers bolting before his bill was paid, roared out to another attendant-- "Run, run, Bob, there's two teas and a glass of brandy and water escaped over the fence-catch 'er." A CZELEBATED hangman in England, showing the gallows attached to Newgate, observed to the bystanders that he had hung twenty persons on it at one time. Some one suggested that it was too small.

Our Ancestors.-Cicero relates, that the ugliest and most stupid slaves in Rome came from England. Moreover he urges his friend Atticus "not to buy slaves from Britain, on account of their stupidity, and their inaptitude to learn music and other accomplishments."  Caesar describes the Britons generally as a nation of very barbarous Tnanners. He says--"Most of the people of the interior never saw corn, but live on milk and flesh, and are clothed in skins." In another place, he remarks: "In their domestic and social habits, the Britons are as degraded as the most savage nations." In fact, our ancestors dwelt in caves, like wild beasts, or ' in huts of no better construction than the miserable wigwam of the most savage Indian. SMTR IDAN'S answer to Lord Lauderdale was excellent. On the latter saying he would repeat some good thing Sheridan had mentioned to him: "Pray don't, my dear Lauderdale: a joke in your mouth is no laughing matter."

I was to perform in a new piece, something like those pretty little affecting dramas they get up now at our minor theatres; and in my character I represented a poor friendless orphan girl, reduced to the most wretched poverty. A heartless tradesman prosecutes the sad heroine for a heavy debt, and insists on putting her in prison unless some one will be bail for her The girl replies, ' Then I have no hope, I have not a friend in the world.' 'What I will no one be bail for you, to save you from prison?' asks the stern creditor. ' I have told you I have not a friend on earth,' was the reply. But just as I was uttering the words, I saw a sailor in the upper gallery springing over the railing, letting himself down from  one tier to another, until he bounded clear over the orchestra and foot-lights, and placed himself beside me in a moment.  'Yes, you shall have one friend at least, my poor young woman,' said he, with the greatest expression in his honest, sunburnt countenance; ' I will go bail for you to any amount. And as for you (turning to the frightened actor), if you don't bear a hand, and shift your moorings, you lubber, it will be worse for you when I come across your bows.' Every creature in the house rose; the uproar was perfectly indescribable; peals of laughter, screams of terror, cheers from his tawny messmates in the gallery, preparatory scrapings of violins from the orchestra; and amidst the universal din there stood the unconscious cause of it, sheltering me,' the poor, dis- tressed young woman,' and breathing defiance and destruction against my mimic persecutor. He could hardly be persuaded to relinquish his care of me." SOME one says that the first weeping willow in England was planted by Pope, the poet. He received a present of figs from Turkey, and observing a twig in the basket ready to bud, he planted it in his garden, and it soon became a fine tree.

A PAGE OF AXIOMS. TaRTH is always consistent with itself, and needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, sits upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; a lie is troublesome, and sets a man's inven- tion upon the rack, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good. BEFORE an affliction is digested, consolation ever comes too soon; there is but one mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a comforter to take aim at. How brightly do little joys beam upon a soul which stands on a ground darkened by the clouds of sorrow: so do stars come forth from the empty sky, when we look up to them from a deep well NoNE are so hard to please as those whom satiety of pleasure makes weary of themselves; nor any so readily provoked as those who have been always courted with an emulation of civility. A MAN with great talents, but void of discretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, strong and blind; endued with an irresistible force, which, for want of sight, is of no use to him. GOOD manners is the art of making those people easy with whom we converse. Whoever makes the fewest persons uneasy, is the best bred in the company., PisxEvxsANcE not only goes far to insure success, but also obtains honors for those who, although the least fortunate, have been the most diligent.

OHT-OHAT              161 Dash my Buttons.--Touemng buttons, I may observe that there is a curious law extant with regard to them. It is by Acts of Parliament passed in three reigns--William II., Anne, and George I.,-perfectly illegal for tailors to make, or mortal man to wear, clothes with any other buttons appended thereto, but buttons of brass This law is in force for the benefit of the Birmingham makers; and it further enacts not only that he who makes or sells garments with any other than brass buttons thereto affixed shall pay a penalty of forty shillings for every dozen, but that he shall not be able to recover the price he claims, if the wearer thinks proper to resist payment. Nor is the act a dead letter. It is not many weeks since that honest Mr. Shirley sued plain Mr. King for nine pounds sterling, due for a suit of clothes. King pleaded non- liability on the ground of an illegal transaction, the buttons on the garment supplied being made of cloth, or bone covered with cloth, in. stead of gay and glittering brass, as the law directs. The judge allowed the plea; and the defendant having thus gained a double suit without cost, immediately proceeded against the defendant to recover his share of the forty shillings for every dozen buttons which the poor tailor had unwittingly supplied. A remarkable feature in this case, was, that the judge who admitted the plea, the barrister who set up, and the client who profited by it, were themselves all buttoned contrary to law. A GENTLMAN went in a cab the other day to the Bois de Boulogne, paid his fare, told the driver to wait half an hour, and if he did not return, to deliver three letters, which he would find on the seat of the cab, to their address. He then disappeared.   The cab-driver was frightened, and rushed into the wood after him. He found him hang. ing by his neck to a tree. He cut him down, and ran off to Madrid for a glass of brandy. When he got back the young man had vanished. He afterwards found him sitting at a little green table, drinking a sherry cobbler. He gave him back the three letters, and received ten francs in exchange. He swore never to disclose the secret, and went straight- way to the commissary of police, and told him all that had happened.

Origin of Foolscap.--Every sclhoolboy knows what foolscap paper is, but we doubt whether one in a hundred, that daily use it, call tell why it was so called. When Oliver Cromwell became Protector, after the execution of Charles I., he caused the stamp of the cap of liberty to be placed upon: the paper used by the government. Soon after the Restoration, Charles II having occasion to use some paper, for dispatches, some of this government paper was brought to him. On looking at it and dis- covering the stamp, he inquired the meaning of it, and, on being told, he said, "Take it away, I'll have nothing to do with a fool's cap." Snoring Prevented.-Dr. L. A. Dugas relates the case of a boy, about five years of age, whose respiration during sleep was so bad that his parents feared he might suffocate. He -found the uvula to hang flabby and rest on the base of the tongue, though not paralysed, as it retracted when -touched by an instrument, and sometimes spontaneously. Dr. D. clipped off the uvula, and the child has not snored since. He suggests that it might be advisable to resort to this operation for the relief of snoring adults, or rather for the relief of those annoyed by such bed-fellows hAOARONIO VERSES, Wrra all its license of absurdity, your true Macaronie verse obeys defined and rigid laws. All poems in twelve books are not epics, all funny jumbles of language are not Macaronics. The Macaronic, like the epic, stands on its dignity.    l "Amo, amas, I love a lass," &amp;3. is not Macaronic; nor yet Rormm corm, Bunt Divorum, Harem searmm Dive." O'Keefe was very funny, but he was not Up to the mark in Macaronic verse. The true Macaronic takes a vulgar tongue and makes it classical with Latin endings. It is a jumble of Latin, whether with Italian or French and German Latinized, interspersed with a few words truly Latin and some homely sentences of humor. That is the groundwork, the body   OHT-OHAT.               163 of the Macaronic, but its spirit ought to be true humor, the best quality of wit. Latin and Elnglish, or dog-latin in combination, constitutes simply a burlesque. Person's verses on the alarm of the French inva- sion, of which we quote a few stanzas very apt and to the purpose just now, are a specimen of this: "Ego nunquam audivi such terrible news, At this present tempus my senses confuse; I'm drawn for a miles, 1 must go cum Marte And concinus ense, engage Bonaparte. "Such tempora nunquam videbant majores, For then their opponents had different mores; But we will soon prove to the Corsican vaunter, Tho' times may be changed, Britons never mutantur. "Mehercle I this consul non potest be quiet, His word must be lex, and when he says flat, Quasi Deus, he thinks we must run at his nod; But Britons were ne'er good at running, by God i "Per mare, I rather am led to opine To meet British naves he would not incline; Lest he should in mare profundum be drowned, 'Et cum alga non laura, his caput be crowned. "But allow that this boaster in Britain could land, Multus cum alis at his command, Here are lads who will meet, ay, and properly work 'em, And speedily send 'em, ni fallor, in orcunm." This is not Macaronic. The thing is becoming somewhat rare, as all things thoroughly genuine are apt to become. On the break-up of the constitution of language among men of learning in the middle ages, an extremely comic jumble-whereof there exist traces in our law-books- was produced; and many theological treatises, poems, epigrams, and love-songs were written in a manner pseudo-Macaronic. During the Thirty Years' War, the mixture of nations among the soldiers at work in Germany gave rise among the people to a pseudo-Macaronic language. Shelton is pseudo-Macaronic.   For one of the best true Macaronics in our own day, we are indebted to the wit of Mr. Gilbert Abbott A'Beckett. We may reproduce it as a convenient specimen, though it is doubtless well known to many of our readers:  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7492-00000089"/> -164            o  i T -O If AT.

Our Macaronic heroes in the list of M. Delepierre are Drummond of Hawthornden, Thomas Coryate, George Ruggle, Edward Benlowes, the two William Kings, Alexander Geddes, Felix Farley, and Tom Dishington    Not all of them quite so famous as Homer, Milton, and men of, the epic set, but very pleasant fellows notwithstanding. Why this kind of verse is entitled Macaronic seems to be a point on which the doctors differ. Because it makes a homely, clumsy jumble of the dignity of Latin, some say that it is named from Maccarone, 4 a pudding-headed lout." Others say that it comes from the good victual Macaroni, because it is a dainty dish to set before a king. Heart-breakers Ahead--Steady, Boys, Steady!-The Boston Post says: "There are thirteen thousand marriageable girls now in the factories of Lowell."

I WAS sitting in my office one afternoon in the autumn of 18-, when a most respectable storekeeper of Broadway was announced. After a little hesitation, he said, *' I have come to you on a most unpleasant business, and one in which I suspect you will not interfere." "What do you mean?"I replied. "Why-a merchant of great wealth and standing has twice purchased goods at my store, and paid for them in counterfeit notes" "Well, we must arrest the merchant." "Yes, but I know you will not." "Why?" "Because he is one of your party, in addition to being of considerable reputation."         , "Who is it?" "Mr.   . "Impossible, there is some mistake." "I told you at first you would not arrest him; Then you refuse to assist me?" "I must be satisfied first-what evidence have you!" "I can swear to him, so can my book-keeper, Iand the clerk." "Are you sure he is the manf " "He has been watched; besides, I know him as well as I do you. Twice he has come to my store. The second time the money was marked, and is counterfeit. Here it is." "Then your book-keeper and your clerk can swear that they received these counterfeit notes from Mr. --- " "Undoubtedly." "Sir, I shall not shrink from my duty when the time arrives." After a few words more he departed. As I walked home, I thought of nothing but the atrocious meanness of this millionaire, and resolved to nerve myself to expose and punish him. In this place let me say that my hesitation did not proceed from any desire to screen the accused, but from a very proper feeling that ought to influence every man connected with the administration of justice-to peril no man's reputation rashy. Some few days afterwards I was told a -person wanted to see me immediately-he was the clerk of the storekeeper. "Sir, the gentleman who has twice passed counterfeit money is now in our store; will you step in and identify him to satisfy yourself!"  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7492-00000090"/> 166           OHT-CHAT. I seized my hat, and in five minutes entered his store. Sure enough, it was Mr: --. As we were old acquaintances, he advanced, and we spoke together for afew minutes. In order to disarm suspicion, I made a trifling purchase, and left him there. In a short time the storekeeper came to my- office, and said, "I hope you ate convinced it was Mr. --, but your coming put him on his guard. He paid his bill in these notes, which are perfectly genuine." "Are you sure that was the person who passed the other notes " "Perfectly." "Well, I am now convinced; get your evidence ready, and I will do my duty." The next morning he returned seemingly agitated. "Mr. --  has come back, and has made another purchase; he is dressed somewhat differently, but he is the same person, and has again paid in these coun- terfeit notes. I have detained him in my shop. I now demand that you send an officer with me." Requesting one of our most trusty stars to accompany the storekeeper, I awaited the result in a most unpleasant state of mind. I had known him for years, he had done me many services, and I felt as grieved as though it had been my own brother. They soon returned with the suspected man in custody. I noticed the different dress, but the man was undoubtedly my old acquaintance. Upon my regretting to see one I had so long esteemed in such a painful situation, and expressing my hope that he would be able to explain how he became possessed of the forged notes, he boldly declared that he had never seen me before, that his name was --, and that he had only been in New York three weeks. After some examination, perceiving the evidence so strong against him, he confessed to the fraud, but laid the blame on another who had tempted him. He was tried and sen tenced to the State Prison. What is still more singular, my friend Mr. -- walls about Broad- way, deals at that very store, and dines occasionally with me, without the slightest suspicion that he has ever been suspected of any offence. HERE is another Irish story An Irishman, who had jumped, into the water to save a man from drowning, on receiving a sixpence from the person as a reward for his services, looked first at the sixpence and then at him, -and at last exclaimed, "I am over-paid for the job."

In looking over a collec- tion: of prints, I find Wickliffe, William Tyndale, Dean- Donne, George Herbert, Robert Herrick, Robert Burton, Bishop Jeremy Taylor, Arch- bishop Spottiswood, Thomas Fuller, Usher the Primate, and Robert Southey, all using the moustache; as did Knox and Bunyan. The Jesuits in India, I believe, still wear it. I have been unable to trace the latest instance of a clergyman wearing his gown and cassock in the streets; the custom apparently died out in the reign of one of the early Georges.  IT is within the observation of all of us, that those who retire from a long and active business life, soon fall into disease and die; and scarcely a day passes in which the observant physician does not see that the difference to many between health and disease, is the distance between the drawlng-room and the wash-tub-the distance between the quill and the crow-bar-while the instructive fact with its terrible warning stares us in the face, that " the average duration of the life of men after retiring from business' is less than three years." A ROMAN ecclesiastic, in reply to whatever question might be pro- posed, began by saying, "I make a distinction." A cardinal having invited him to dine, proposed to derive some amusement for the com- pany from the well known peculiarity of his guest. Saying to him that he had an important question to' propose, he asked, "Is it under any circumstances lawful to baptize in soup!" "I make a distinction," said the priest; " if you ask, is it lawful to baptize in soup in general, I say no I if you ask, is it lawful to baptize in your excellency's soup, I say yes I for there is really no difference between it and water." A Great Ass.-A fellow went to the parish priest, and told him, with a long face, that he had seen a ghost. "When and where V" said the pastor. "Last night," replied the man, "I was passing by the church, and up against the wall of it did I behold the spectre."!"In what shape did it appear?" replied the priest. "It appeared in the shape of a great ass."

Mr. Goldsmith, a merchant of London, has been killed on a mountain near Geneva, and Mr. Richard Clark, son of Mr. Clark, of Doncaster has been badly hurt. The gentlemen ascended the mountain from Geneva; they rashy attempted to descend on the other side, where there is no road. When the route became dangerous, Mr. Clark halted, but his companion pushed on-he fell into a chasm and was killed. After a time, Mr. Clark advanced to look for his friend: he, too, had a fall, and became insensible. On recovering, he found that his. left thigh-was broken, and his right ankle crushed; and his hat, shoes, and walking-stick were gone. As it was near nightfall, Mr. Clark deter- mined to abide where he was until morning, and then to signal for assistance. Early on the following morning he succeeded in attracting the attention of some peasants, two of whom came to his assistance; but, finding him incapable of moving himself, and also much exhausted, they procured other help, anid some bread and brandy, which the suf- ferer said was most welcome. With great difficulty he was got safely to the foot of the mountain. Subsequently, Mr. Goldsmith's body was found. This was not the first accident to tourists in the same place; yet there is no warning notice erected on the summit of the mountain. WHEN Sully, the celebrated composer, was once dangerously ill, his friends sent for a confessor; who, finding his situation critical, and his mind much agitated and alarmed, told him there was only one. way by which he could obtain absolution, and that- was by burning all that he had composed of an unpublished opera. Remonstrance was in vain. Sully burned the music, and the confessor withdrew. On his recovery,' a nobleman, who was his patron, calling to see him, was informed of the sacrifice which he had made. "And so," said he, " you have burnt your opera; and you are really such a blockhead as to believe in the absurdities of a monk " "Stop, my friend, stop," said Sully, whisper- ing in his ear, "I knew very well what I was about--I have another copy."'

The purpose of these beds is to prevent a person from oversleeping himself, or, if he does not awake at the time the alarm is sounded, the machinery operates in such a manner as to chuck him out upon the floor, much to his astonishment. For instance, when a person wishes to retire to bed, he winds -up an alarm clock attached to the bed, and sets it at the hour he wishes to get up. At the appointed hour-the alarm sounds, and, if the sleeper is awakened, he may arise; but, if he does not awake, the machinery of the clock, operating on a lever, upsets the bed-frame, and the occupant is tilted out upon the floor. This bed is worthy the inspection of heads of families, who have the care of sluggards and sleepy-heads. We have a good story to tell in connexion with one of those beds (says the Uncle Sam, a "Bosting" paper). A friend of ours recently got married to a lovely and interesting young woman. In the house of the bride's father, where the wedding took place, one of the " alarm beds" had just previously been introduced. The wedding party was very large and fashionable, and everything went off with the utmost merriment, the entertainment being of the most generous kind. At length, the feasting over, and the hour of midnight past, the guests began to retire, and the lights to grow dim in the house. The s" old folks" hinted gently about sleep, and the bride and her lord grew weary and impatient. It was easily seen that they wished to be alone, and the lady was accordingly escorted to her chamber, to which blissful haven the blushing bridegroom soon-followed her. We will not attempt to draw a picture of what ensued, but suffice it to say, that a click, click, was heard, and the astonished couple, the, next instant, found themselves launched upon the floor in the middle of the room, fast locked in each other's arms, holding on like good fel- lows, in momentary expectation of an earthquake. They survived the shock, however. WrY is a pig in a parlor like a house on fire I Because the sooner it is put out the better.

A new cantatric was to make her first appearance, and he had decided to see her. His physi- cian informed him that the attempt to go would be useless, and the priest admonished him to serious thoughts. "AR very good, monsieur," said the dying man; " but I had made up my mind to,go, and it is pro- voking that I cannot." He was dead before the first note of the over- ture had been played. We find another characteristic anecdote in the same paper from which we have translated the above. A second man was on his death-bed. He had been a bon-vivant, rich, well-dressed, and a pleasure-seeker. Perfectly collected, he took leave of the world with the exclamation: "At,last the farce is over." Philosophy like this is to be found only in France.

Idlenes--Its Dangers.-There is an old proverb that tells us, "Idleness is the devil's pillow;" and well may it be so esteemed, for no head ever rested upon ic but the lips of the evil spirit were ever at his ear, breathing falsehood and temptation. The industrious man is sel- dom found guilty of a crime, for he has no time to listen to the enticings of the wicked one, and he is content with the enjoyments his honesty affords. It is the vicious idler, vexed to see the fortunes of his indus- trious neighbor growing, while he is lounging and murmuring, who robs and plunders, that he may get unlawful gain. It is the merry, thoughtless idler who, to relieve the nothingness of his days, seeks the wine cup and the gaming table. It is the sensual idler, whose licentious ear is opened to the voice of the tempter as often as his track crosses the path of youth and inflbcence. Anecdote of Sheridan.-Holland's theatre, the handsomest in the kingdom, was destined to a short existence, being totally burned down on the night of February 24, 1809, when it had stood only fifteen years. The following authentic anecdote in connexion with the building has not before, as we believe, appeared in print. Holland could never obtain a settlement, or an interview on the subject, with Sheridan. He hunted him for weeks and months, at his own house, at the theatre, at his usual resorts, but he was nowhere to be seen. At last he tracked him to the stage door, rushed in, in spite of the opposition of the burly porter, and found the manager on the stage, conversing with a party of gentlemen whom he had invited, to show them the theatre. Sheridan saw Holland approaching, and knowing that escape was this time impossible, put a bold face on the matter. "Ah I my dear fellow," exclaimed he, "you are the very man I wanted to see; you have come most apropos. I am truly sorry you have had the trouble of calling on me so often, but now we are met, in a few minutes I shall be at liberty; we will then go into my room and settle our affairs. But first you must decide an important question here.. Some of these gentlemen tell me there are complaints, and loud ones, that the transmission of sound is defective in your beau- tiful theatre-that, in fact, the galleries cannot hear at all-and that is the reason why they have become so noisy of late." "Sound defective! not hear!" reiterated the astonished architect, turning pale and almost staggering back; " why, it's the most perfect building for sound that ever was erected; rll stake my reputation on it, the complaint is most groundless." "So I say," retorted Sheridan; " but now we'll bring the   OHT-OHAT.             178 question to issue definitively, and then have a paragraph or two in the papers. Do you, Holland, go and place yourself at the back of the upper gallery, while I stand here and talk to you."  "Certainly," said Holland, " with the greatest pleasure." A lantern was provided, with a trusty guide, and away went the architect through a labyrinth of dark and winding passages, almost a day's journey, until he reached his distant and elevated post. "Now, Mr. Holland," cried Sheridan, "are you there, and ready " "Yes," was the immediate answer. "Can you hear me?" "Perfectly, perfectly, Mr. Sheridan." "Then I wish you a very good morning." So saying, Sheridan disappeared, and was two or three miles off, before Holland could descend. Another long interval occurred before he was able to chase the fugitive to his lair again.

The Prime Cost of a Broken Heart.-A New York paper says the late Robert C. Sands sued for damages in a case of breach of pro- mise of marriage. He was offered two hundred dollars to heal his broken heart. "Two hundred," he exclaimed, "two hundred dollars for ruined hopes, a blasted life I two hundred dollars for all this I No, never I Make it three and it's a bargain!" A Preacher Surprised.--A few Sundays since there occurred rather a curious scene in the parish church of Campsie. A reverend gentleman proceeded to the pulpit to officiate for the Rev. Thomas Monroe, the minister of the parish. Mr. -- had gone through the usual routine of singing, prayer, &amp;c., had just given out the text, and was commenc- ing his discourse, when a woman got up, and, at the top of her voice, exclaimed: "Gae hame wi' you, sir, an' learn your lesson (a slight pause); gae hame, I say, an' learn your sermon afore ye come here  We're nae accustomed wi' a man readin' a sermon tae us--we can read ane at hame oursels.

PARODY ON LONGFLIOW'S LINES ON TE DEATH OF WELLINGTO4. ONE of the most felicitous parodies we have met with is from the Lan- tern. It is a quiz on the poem of the Warden of the Cinque Ports: THE WATCHMAN OF THE FIVE POINTS. BY PROFESSOR LILTLEOHAiP. A CRowD was driving down the New York Bowerie, The day was growing night, And through the windows-for the eve was showery- Glared strong the pale gas light.

WE hoped, At all events, that the exhibition of one extreme would rouse us to a sense of the folly of another. We might abridge the robes of our ladies without cutting them off at the knees. The garments of our women are on the whole graceful and becoming: but they are certainly unfavorable to the free use of the limbs. The length of the gown, as now worn, was surely never intended to promote pedestrian exercise. It is inconvenient and often unseemly. Even the plea of modesty fails; for women are compelled to hold up their gowns, and do so often with a liberality of exposure. which would be quite unnecessary if the dress- maker cut them a little shorter. But it is not a question of modesty at all. 'We never could understand the immodesty of a woman showing her feet. The lady who, being rebuked on this score by another who was decolletee after the fashion of Kneller's pictures, answered, that she thought modesty would not suffer, if her friend pulled up her own dress a little, or cut a piece off the bottom to fasten on the top, laid bare by one of the most absurd of modern conventionalities. Modesty assuredly does not require that our women should sweep the floors, or play the scavenger in the streets, with the bottoms of their gowns. So far at least it is clear to us that Bloomerism, which would abridge the length of our female garments, has the best of the argument. But our women still go on. draggling, from year's end to year's end, and a lamentable spectacle they present in dirty weather, which in England is the rule and not the exception. Our female modesty seems to begin at the toes. What the code of decency is-by what considerations it is regulated-it is impossible to determine.

But no one is well dressed who is not bien chaussee. Even a man well-gloved and well-booted may carry off a seedy suit of clothes. With women it is essential to any- thing like success in costume, that they should pay attention to the decoration of their hands and feet. The latter may be little seen; but they are seen. As to the extremities themselves, the real state of the case may generally be gathered from inference and association. It. sel- dom happens that a woman with large, mis-shapen, or flat feet, moves gracefully and well Dissipation.-The life of the gay man is a system of self-indulgence, of self-gratification, and of self-worship. The miser, m his despised and isolated sphere, has'no power upon the happiness of society. The priva- tions he imposes extend no further than himself; and if no other indi- vidual shares in what he gains, he is alone in the punishment he inflicts; but the dissipated man has a wider influence, because he is the hero of society in its worst state. He has, therefore, the power to disseminate evil in a degree proportionate to his popularity; and in the same mea- sure as he is beloved he is capable of inflicting misery. He knows that he is the cause of floods of burning tears, and while he weighs them against one intoxicating draught, it is self-love that prompts him again to hold the sparkling poison to his lips, and to let the tears flow on. A aonm out West, who had become tired of single blessedness, thus wrote to her intended: "DEAR JIr,-Cum rite off if you're cumin' at all, as Sile Holmes is insistin' that I shall have him, and he hugs and kisses me so continually, that I kan't hold out much longer.

When we were little children and sang or whistled in a manner inde- pendent of the rules of harmony, our nurses told us that "The old cow (what cow I whqose cow?) died of such a tune;" and it often struck us that there must be some curious or fantastic legend connected with the phrase so commonly heard, ' That's the tune the old cow died of" Anxious to solve this mystery, we instituted a rigorous search into a collection of ballads, and the following fragment,-though it does not speak of the actual death,-yet infers a suffering so intense on the part of the cow, that we may very well imagine the poet drew a veil over her final agony, and left it to the fancy of the reader. We give the lines without further preamble: "There was a Piper had a Cow, And he had naught to give her, He pulled out his pipes and played her a tune, And bade the cow consider. "The cow considered very well, And gave the piper a penny, And bade him play the other tune, Corn rigs are bonny." There is a great deal of truth and feeling manifest here, and probably a sad personal history; undoubtedly the " piper " was a poet, and not only a poet, but the very poet who wrote these lines. Observe that the lines contain neither praise nor blame of the music. The piper was the cow's " unhappy master," and yet had naught to feed her with: under the circumstances, therefore, he pulled out his pipes and played her a tune, and bade her consider what in his circumstances she could do more for him. We know that the piper himself is the poet here, from the simplicity with which he describes his own conduct, and as it were seeks. to smother his own heroism in our admiration of the cow's endurance. This piper is poor--probably driven up into the mountain solitudes by a tyrant who feared the songs of freedom. He is so poor as even to receive a penny with gratitude (" and gave the piper a penny"); yet he sits down opposite his dying cow, whose milk had nourished him so long, and to soothe her last agonies offers to play a tune. The poor animal is not formed for spiritual hope; her wants are confined to this world--and just as the breath of life is about to leave her, she asks her poor poet-owner to change this tune (" to play the other tune") and let 8*    &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7492-00000096"/> '178          OHT-CHAT. the blest assurance that "Corn rigs are bonny" usher her into the sleep that knows no waking. There is a touching history here, and one on which the moralist could well dilate.

Parlor Pastime--'Vraglc Milk.-Lime water is quite as transparent and clear as common spring water: but if we breathe or blow into it, the bright liquid becomes opalescent, and as white as milk. The best way to try this simple experiment is to put some powdered quicklime into a wile bottle full of cold water, shake them well together now and then, then allow the bottle to remain quiet till the next day, when the clear lime water may be poured off from the sediment. Now fill a wine glass or tumbler with the lime water thus made, and blow through the liquid with a glass tube, a piece of new tobacco pipe, or a clean straw, and in the course of a minute or so, as the magicians say, "The water will be turned into milk." By means of this pastime " wise men" can ascertain which young ladies are in love, and which young gentlemen are not. With a shrewd guess, they present as a test, a glass of lime water to the one and of pure water to the other, with unerring effect.

How to Treat a Wife.--First, get a wife: secondly, be patient. You may have great trials and perplexities-in your business with the World; but do not, therefore, carry to your home a cloudy or contracted brow. Your wife may have many trials, which, though of less magnitude, may have been as hard to bea;. A kind, conciliating word; a tender look, will do wonders in chasing from her brow all clouds of gloom. You encounter your difficulties in the open air, fanned by heaven's cool breezes; but your wife -is often shut in from these healthful influences, and her health fails, and her spirits lose their elasticity. But oh! bear with her; she has trials and sorrows to which you are a stranger, but which your tenderness can deprive of all their anguish. Notice knidly her little attentions and efforts to promote your comfort. Do not take them all as a matter of course, and pass them by, at the same time being very sure to observe any omission of what you may consider duty to you. Do not treat her with indifference, if you would not sear and palsy her heart, which, watered by kindness, would, to the latest day of your existence, throb with sincere and constant affection. Sometimes yield your wishes to hers She has preferences as strong as you, and it may be just as trying to, her to yield her choice, as to you. Do you find it hard to yield sometimes? Think you it is not difficult for her to give up always? If you never yield to her wishes, there is danger that she will think you are selfish, and care only for yourself; and with such feelings she cannot love as she might. Again, show yourself manly, so that your wife may look up to you, and feel that you will act nobly, and that she can confide in your judgment.

IN order to ascertain the height of an object, a peculiar method of measurement is in use among the Isthmus Indians. In measuring the height of a tree, for instance, a man proceeds from its base to a point where, on turning the back towards it, and putting the head between the legs, he can just see the top; at the spot where he is able to do this he makes a mark on the ground, and then paces the distance to the base of the tree: this distance is equal to the height.   OU Ir- OIAT.            181 WE heard a friend relate the accompanying incident the other day with not a little zest, and to the amusement of a good many by- standers. "Jumping into an old-fashioned stage-coach last month, in company with nine others, to jostle over ten miles of unfinished road between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, I was very much amused with the follow- ing characteristic dialogue between a,regular question-asking Down- Easter' and a high-heeled Southerner. We were scarcely seated, before our Yankee began: "' Travelling East, I expect I' "' Yes, sir.' "' Goin' to Philadelphia, I reckon ' I' No, sir.' "'Oh, ah: to New York, maybe {" "' Yes, sir,' "' Calc'latin' to buy goods, I presume V' "' No, sir.' "' Never ben there before, I wouldn't wonder I' "No, sir; never.' "' New York is a wonderful place.' "' Such is my impression, sir.' "' Got letters, I expect I' "'Yes, sir; I am provided with letters of introduction.' "' Wouldn't mind showin' you round myself a spell, if you wanted' "' I thank you, sir; but I shall not require your assistance.' "This last remark of the polite but reserved stranger was a poser; and the 'inquisitor' fell back a moment to take breath, and change his tactics. The half-suppressed smile upon the faces of the other passengers soon aroused the Yankee to still further exertions; and summoning up more resolution, he began again. "' Stranger, perhaps you are not aware how almighty hard it is for a Yankee to control his curiosity. You'll please excuse me, but I really would like to know your name, and residence, and the business you follow. I expect you ain't ashamed of either of 'em; so now won't you just oblige me?' "This last appeal brought out our Southern friend; who, rising up to the extremest height allowed by the coach, and throwing back his shoulders, replied: "' My  name is General Andrew Washington.

THE following anecdote, said by a London journal to be entirely true, would seem to indicate a high state of intelligence in certain parts of "enlightened England:" "The Bishop of Oxford sent round to the church-wardens in his diocese a circular of inquiries, among which was the following: "'Does your officiating clergyman preach the Gospel, and are his conversation and carriage consistent therewith?" "The church-warden near Wallingford replied: "' Our officiating clergyman preaches the Gospel, but he doesn't keep a carriage of any kind!" Now this reply may have been intended as a joke, to which there was a strong temptation in the word " carriage," but that it was intended as such, does not seem to have been the opinion of the London editor who relates it By-the-by, we remember a similar joke once perpetrated by an office-holder in Alabama, if we recollect rightly, which resulted in rather serious consequences to the perpetrator.  The Postmaster- General had written him a letter somewhat like the following: "DEAs BnS--You will please inform this Department how far the Tombighee River runs up. "Respectfully, ac., Postmaster-General." The return mail brought to the Department the annexed curt reply: *"SIR--In answer to yours of the -- instant, I have to state that the Tombighe0 River doesn't mrn up at aU 1" This brief epistle was followed by one equally terse and equally effective. It ran as follows:   , "SIn-You are hereby informed that this Department has no longer any occasion for your services. ("Respectfully, &amp;c., Postmaster-General."

THE following anecdote affords an amusing specimen of simplicity and ignorance of common things in two eminent literary men: Cottle the publisher drove Wordsworth from Bristol to Alfoxden in a gig, calling at Stowey by the way, to summon Coleridge and Miss Wordsworth, who followeds swiftly on foot. The Alfoxden pantry was empty--so they carried with them bread and cheese, and a bottle of brandy. A beggar stole the cheese, which set Coleridge expatiating on the superior virtues of brandy. It was he that, with thirsty impa- tience, took out the horse; but, as he let down the shafts, the theme of his eloquence rolled from the seat, and was dashed to pieces on the ground. Coleridge, abashed, gave the horse up to Cottle, who tried to pull off the collar. It proved too much for the worthy eitizen's strength, and he called to Wordsworth to assist: Wordsworth retired baffled, and was relieved by the ever-handy Coleridge. There seemed more likeli- hood of their pulling off the animal's head than his collar, and they marvelled by what magic it had ever been got on.   "La, masterl " said the servant-grl, who was passing by, " you don't go the right way to work;" and turning round the eollar, she slipped it off in an instant, to the utter confusion of the three luminaries. IIow Silas Comberbatch could have gone through his cavalry training, and Wordsworth have spent nine-tenths of his life in the country, and neither of them have witnessed the harnessing or unharnessing of a horse, must remain a problem for our betters.

A CERTAIN steamboat captain had become popular on the river as a commander, and was about to take charge of a new boat, one of the handsomest that was ever built in the' West. On the evening preced- ing the morning she was to leave port, he was induced by one of the owners to visit his house, where there was to be a party of ladies some of whom were to be his passengers to New Orleans. The captain felt a little queer about going; he was more at home on the hurricane deck, or the social hall of his boat, than in the drawing-room among ladies. He summoned up courage, however, went, and was introduced to the com- pany. "Captain D.," said one of his lady passengers, " you must be a happy man, to be master of so beautiful a boat." "She is a beautiful boat, madam; sits on the water like a duck." He was " in town" as long as the conversation was about steamboats. "Captain D."' said another lady, a bluestocking of the Lydia Languish tribe, "what do you think of the immortal Shakespeare?" "Think, madam I think I I think she burns too much wood, draws too much water, and carries too little freight." We never learned whether the captain stayed any longer or not.

Newsboy Wit.--A gentleman crossing the Fulton ferry not long since, was accosted by one of those peripatetic venders of cheap litera- ture and weekly newspapers, who are to be found in shoals about all our public places, with "-Buy Bulwer'8 last work, sir Only two shilling." The gentleman, willing to have a laugh with the urchin, said-- "Why, I am Bulwer, myself." Off went the lad and whispered to another at a little distance, excit- ing his wonderment at the information he had to impart. Eyeing the pretended author of Pelham with a kind of awe, he approached him timidly, and, holding out a pamphlet, said modestly, "Buy the Women of England, sirI You're not Mra Ellis, are you?" The proposed sale was effected. A Christmas Tale.-While the last century was flourishing, there dwelt in what is now a famous city not a mile from 'Boston, an opulent widow lady, who once afforded a queer illustration of that cold com- pound of incompatibles, called " human nature." It was a Christmas Eve, of one of those old-fashioned winters which were so bitter cold. The old lady put on an extra shawl; and as she hugged her shivering frame, she said to her faithful negro servant: "( It's a terrible cold night, Scip. I am afraid my poor neighbor, Widow Green, must be suffering. Take the wheelbarrow, Scip. Fill it full of wood. Pile on a good load; and tell the poor woman to keep her- self warm and comfortable. But before you go, Scip, put some more wood on the fire, and make me a nice mug of flip.' These last orders were duly obeyed; and the old lady was thoroughly warmed, both inside and out. And now the trusty Scipio was about to depart on his errand of mercy, when his considerate mistress interposed again. "Stop, Scip. You need not go now. The weather has moderated." THEODORE Hoox was walking, in the days of Warren's blacking, where one of the emissaries of that shining character had written on the wall, "Try Warren's B----," but had been frightened from' his propriety, and fled.

"No Use Talring."-A young enthusiast was talking to his intended a few evenings since, urging her to consent to a speedy marriage, and a  start to spend the honeymoon in California.

"Bad luck to ye, Mike, you have taken me in. Didn't you say it never desaved you?", "Sure an' I did-nor did it-for I never depinded on it." THAT wasa good one of a man who stopped at a tavern to' pass the night. In the room were two beds; and when safely ensconced, alnd about to fall into a pleasant slumber, the landlord taps gently. "What's the matter 7" says the traveller. "I wish to put a man in one of those beds" "Nobody can come here. Please put the bed in the bill," says he. "That wont answer my purpose," says the host; "I don't wish to put the bed into the bill, I want to put Bill into the bed!" A LADY, who, though in the autumn of life, had not lost all dreams of its spring, said to Douglas Jerrold: "I cannot imagine what makes my hair turn so grey: I sometimes fancy it must be the essence of rose- mary, with which my maid is in the habit of brshing it. What do you think?" "I should rather be afraid, madam," replied the distinguished dramatist, dryly, " that it is the essence of Time!" Benevolence and Happiness.-A life of passionate gratification is not to be compared with a life of active benevolence. God has so con- stituted our nature, that a man cannot be happy unless he is, or thinks he is, a means of good. Judging from our own experience, we cannot con- ceive of a picture of more unutterable wretchedness than is furnished by one who knows that he is wholly useless in the world. Give a man what you please, surround him with all the means of gratification, and yet let the conviction come home to him, clear and irresistible, that there is not a being in God's universe a whit the better or happier for his existence; let him feel that he is thus a blot upon, because a blank in   CHT-PHAT.             189 the universe, and the universe will not furnish a more unhappy being. Herein lies the solution of that, to many, inexplicable fact, that the schemes of mere selfishness, however wisely laid, however successfully and energetically prosecuted, never add to the joys, but always to the paias of those who originate and are engaged in them. It is not so with a man of opposite characteristics. Take from him what you please, and you do not take from him the elements of his joy, if you leave him the conviction that in any way he is useful. If you contract the circle, and diminish the sphere of his influence, you detract from his joy only as you detract from his means of doing good. And, as we cannot conceive of a more wretched being than one who feels himself to be the slave of an uncontrolled selfishness, so we cannot conceive of, a happier being than a man of truly benevolent heart, whose wishes describe the circle and bound the sphere of his, influence, and whose means are ample to give those wishes a full expression. Music and Mental Exertion.-Alfieri often prepared his mind by listening to music. "Almost all my tragedies were sketched in my mind either in the act of hearing music, or a few hours after,"--a cir- cumstance which has been recorded of many- others. Lord Bacon had often music played in the room adjoining his study. Milton listened to his organ for his solemn inspirations; and music was even necessary to Warburton. The symphonies which awoke in the poet sublime emo- tions, might have composed the inventive mind of the great critic in the visions of his theoretical mysteries A celebrated French preacher, Bourdaloue or Massillon, was once found playing on a violin, to screw his mind up to a pitch preparatory to his sermon, which, within a short interval, he was to preach before the court, Curran's favorite mode of meditation was with his violin in his hand; for hours together would he forget himself, running voluntaries on the strings, while his imagination, in collecting its tones, was opening all its faculties for the cunning emergencies of the bar. Truth.--He that finds truth without loving her, is like a bat; which, though it have eyes to discern that there is a sun, yet hath so evil eyes, that it cafinot delight in the sun MY notions about life are much the same as they are about travel- ling; there is a good deal of amusement on the road, but, after all, one wants to be at rest.  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7492-00000102"/> 190            HT-C H T.

AN Irishman was once indulging in the very intellectual occupation of sucking raw eggs and reading a newspaper. By some mischance. he contrived to bolt a live chicken. The poor bird chirped as it went down his throat, and he very politely observed, "Be the powers, my friend, yer spoke too late." A LADY being about to marry a man who was very low of stature, was told -that he was a very bad fellow. "Well,"' says she, " if he's bad, there's one comfort-there is very little of him."

How  the Dutchman gave a Promissory Note.-There were two early German settlers in the western part of Pennsylvania, whose 'names were Peter -- and John --. Peter had increased the size of his farm by annexing to it a small tract of land adjoining, and he lacked about a hundred dollars of the sum which it was necessary to pay for his new acquisition. He called upon his neighbor John to borrow the amount. John consented at once, and, going into another room, he brought out an old bread-basket, and counted down the desired number of dollars; and then the two sat down to two large earthen mugs of cider, and as many pipes of tobacco. After smoking over the matter for a while, it occurred to Peter that in similar transactions he had seen or heard something like a note passing between the borrower and lender, and he suggested as much to John. The lender assented -to the pro- priety of such a course. Paper, pen, and ink, were produced; and between the two a document was concocted, stating that John had loaned Peter one hundred dollars, which Peter would repay to John in (" tree mont's." This Peter signed, and thus far the two financiers made the thing " all regular and ship-shape."  But at this point a difficulty presented itself They both knew that notes were drawn in the opera- tion of borrowing and lending, which they had witnessed; but neither of them had observed what disposition was made of the document; neither could tell whether it was for the borrower or the lender to take charge of the paper. Here was a dilemma I At last a bright idea struck John: "You haves de money to pay, Peter, so you must take dis paper, so as you can see as you haf to pay it." This was conclusive; the common-sense of the thing was unanswerable; and Peter pocketed the money and his own note, so " as he could see as he haf to pay it." Three months passed over, and punctually to the day appeared Peter, and paid over the promised sum to John. This being- done, the mugs and pipes were again brought out.. After puffing awhile, Peter pro- duced the note, and handed it to John, with the remark: "Now, John, you must take the note, so that you can see the money haf been paid " A witty auctioneer was trying to sell an old hand-organ. To that end he was grinding out the music, and the crowd, in sport, began to throw out pennies, when a dandy standing by said, "Sir, you ought to have a monkey."-"My good fellow," replied the auctioneer, "so I had; step right up here."

He bid adieu unto the scenes of never-ending storm, And travelled forth to seek some land where he might keep him Warm. He trudged two years his weary way, far from the land of snow, Inside the walls of China, whither strangers seldom go.' When, wearied with hbis pilgrimage, he halted at Ko-Whang, And there fell in with old Ski-Hi, the father of Che-Bang. by The old man heard his wondrous tale of sights that he had seen, Where nature wore a winding-sheet, and shrouded all things green, And pond'ring o'er, within his mind, if wonders such could be, At last engaged poor Chi-Chil-Bloo to cultivate his tea. * Vulgarly called Aurora-Borealia t Laplandscheo for fever and ague.                                   .

CANTO V. HE gazed transfixed with' wonder-to him sur- prising fair, Were her rounded-up proportions and her salmon colored hair. - He lingered in a dreamy trance, nor woke he from f  his bliss, Till her loving arms entwined him and her lips      I  imprint a kiss.- She led him to a bower, and beside the dwarf she kneeled, And sighed like Desdemonaat his " scapes by flood  Sts^     tJ and field."

WA  oING down Broadway yesterday, I met that most admired and amiable man, General Jaunty. But what a change! It seemed as though he had suddenly grown twenty years younger since our last meeting, the week before. His whiskers were twice their usual size- his locks were more redundant-his moustaches more military. "What has happened to you, General?" said we. He gave his usual good-tempered smile, as he uttered, Ah! you mean my wig?--wall, 11i just tell ye. I went into a barber's, the other evening,- as I was on my way to my favorite California widow, when I thought I would have a shilling's worth done to my hair. Being the only customer, the barber grew talkative as he clipped the ends of my hair.

"Indeed, sir," cried the honest barber, " then I dare not recommend my patent original. I would not swindle any gentleman, even though he were the Queen Victoria; and I don't think it swindling to do the Britishers, sir--I call it spoiling the Philistines." "A noble and highly patriotic sentiment," said I. "Yes, sir; but you are evidently a full-blooded American, and I feel that I am bound to do my duty to you. Let me recommend one of my Apollo invisible wigs, sir; they would really make you look twenty-five years younger. Do you know Mayor Jones, sir?" "Certainly I do," was my response. "He's the handsomest ,and youngest-looking man, sir, in all the Union." "True as an advertisement," I replied. "He looks now, sir, as you know; but you should have seen him be- fore he put himself in my hands, sir-he looked a perfect scarecrow, sir. I give you my sacred honor, he did not know himself when he looked in the glassl 'Who the devil am I ' says the Mayor. I bowed, and said,. ' You are the Honorable -' Then all I can say, Briggs,' (that's my name, sir,) answered the Mayor, ' is, that I am a good-looking fellow-that is to say,' continued his Honor, ' when I have got one of your patent invisible Apollo Beautifiers on.' Sir, he paid me on the spot, and when he got home, his own cook-maid did not know him." "What do you charge for one of your invisible Beautifiers!" said L "Ten dollars, sir-dirt cheap," quoth the barber. "Let me look at one," I unfortunately said. The barber-ous Briggs called to his man to bring some of the invisible wigs. Taking one that was a decided carroty color, he put it on my head, and held a glass for me to look at myself.

The barber was about selecting another, when I said, "Don't trouble yourself; I don't intend buying one to-day. I'll think about it as the weather grows colder." The pertinacious barber returned to the charge, by saying:- "No harm done, sir. I mean no offence. But just permit me to try this on--merely out of curiosity." As he said this, he clapped one on which certainly fitted like a glove. The whiskers, however, were too redundant. "Now, sir, this is an incomparable fit. You really look like- Mr. Willis, the poet, sir. It does not quite sit easy on the top of the head; there's too much of your own natural hair, sir. Permit me--" As he said this, the infernal fellow lifted the wig up, and, in an instant, before I knew what he was about, by a mere clip of his shears, laid my crown nearly Mild. "Confound you!"I roared, jumping up and looking at the glass; "what the deuce did you do that for? I am not going to buy a wig, sir." "Well, sir, there's no harm done; no offence, sir. The hair on the top of your head will grow in a month. You can remain in your own room, and use my renovator. Demosthenes, sir, when he wanted to study, used to shave half of his hair off. Demosthenes was rather clever, sir; don't you think so0 " "Dash Demosthenes," I bellowed. "I suppose I cannot help myself now. I must take your rascally wig." "No must in the case, sir." "How the deuce can I go about with that patch of bald on the top of my head I My friends will think I've got the ring-worm." "Or had your head partially shaven for insanity," observed the im-. pudent rascal. Reseating myself, I submitted to him as he fitted on the wig. It cer- tainly looked well. SThe whiskers were a little too large, but the bar- ber said he could trim them down to a natural size. As he said this, he very coolly lifted up one of the false whiskers, and deliberately, at one stroke of his razor, shaved off the entire of one of my own natural whiskers. 9r,   OIT-O IIAT.            209 "Now," said he, " the whole thing fits to perfection." My rage was great. Up I jumped; blowed him up. But he declar- ed there was no harm done, and that it was done all for the best; in. deed, that I could not possibly miss one whisker out of four, since the usual allowance was only two. I, therefore asked him what I had to pay, when the fellow went to his desk, and presented to me a bill, which ran thus:- For one Patent Invisible Wig, extra splendid, ........ $15 00 -  " "   pair D'Orsay Whiskers, .. .   .60 $22 G0 No charge for cutting Hair, or fixing Wig and Whiskers. Indescribable was my rage. "Why," I exclaimed, "you said that your wigs were only ten dollars." True, sir; that's the red wig, sir. You can have a red wig for that sum." "Confound your red wigs I what use would a red one be to a man with black hair @" "Well, sir, there's no harm done; you need not take my wig at all." "Why, you impudent rogue; you have compelled me to buy one of your cursed things by nearly making me bald, and shaving off one of my whiskers. How can I walk about with only one whisker 1" "Very well, sir; better than with only one leg." "None of your wit, sir," I roared; "( but I'll not pay extra for the whiskers-they belong to the wig. You never said anything [about the whiskers being extra," "No harm done, sir," returned the imperturbable barber; "I don't compel you to buy the whiskers. Allow me, I'll detach them from the wig in a minute." 'Yes, you have compelled me to take them," I retorted, "by shaving off one of my whiskers." "I can easily shave off the other, sir; I won't charge you for that little job." "I go without whiskers altogetherl"I said; "what should I be with- out my whiskers i" "Can't possibly say," returned the barber, in a vex pompous tone. Finding I was in the hands of a Philistine, I paid the money, and when I had got his bill receipted, I said, "You are a most impudent swindler, and I'll never enter your store again."

As I walked away, I heard a peal of laughter follow me down the street. The Ever Presence of Mind.--Where dwells the man that hath ever measured the power of hope, and tracked her to one abiding-place and home? Hope enters unchallenged the portals of the great, and un- invited the threshold of the poor; persuaded by her sister Charity, she "suffereth long," and for days, and months, and years, doth she tarry amid disease, neglect, and want. Wherever there beats a human heart doth she build herself a home, doth she make herself a shrine, and beam forth light, and life, and bliss, and trace upon the dark clouds which surround the future prophecies of blessing and of peace. In childhood is she not our joy,in manhood is she not our strength, in old age is she not our youth again I Whence came she I We cannot tell, save that she met the first man in his fall, and was content to wander forth with him from paradise, and live with him upon a ruined earth, and on earth hath she in mercy ever stayed. Monopolize, ye rich men, wealth! Monopolize, ye great men, honorl Monopolize, ye fair ones, admiration, and ye intellectual ones the voice of praise; but he who hath made all, and feedeth all, and hath mercy upon all, forbids that there should be any monopoly of Hope. No- man can say concerning Hope, that she liveth here or liveth there. Hope is light, and like light is she everywhere to be found. Over the pallid forms of the sick does she stoop, and whispers to them of health and strength again; in their ears sings she Fancy's sweetest songs of sunlit streams and waving trees, and oftentimes nurses once more into a flame the fading spark of life; by fireless hearths she sits, and there is heat; by uncovered boards, and there is bread; by terror- shaken hearts, and there is peace; the morn of life she gilds for all, the eventide of life for some; and forecasting the future for the most deso. lated, for the most sad, she hath been known to stand beside the grave, and with more than magic power turn the heart's dirge into a song. Such is Hope, streaming in upon the soiled world of labor and sin; even as the sunbeam through the shutter's chink into the dusty room, she connects us with the skies by a band of light--she uprears a bright ladder from earth to heaven, and thereon pass to and fro the messen- gers of peace, while we lie pillowed on the hard stones beneath.

"I scarcely expected, dear Frederick," said she, " that you would have remained constant; I thought perhaps the news of the dreadful occur- rence might have induced you to retract; and that you might have considered it a perfect justification of your withdrawal." "What accident?" said L "Tell me, my beloved." "Don't you know, Frederick!" said my affectionate companion., "Indeed I do not," said I; and at that moment I heard the same noise which so frequently attracted my attention, and interrupted her for a moment by asking her if she did not hear that thumping, as I thought, of the chariot on the perch. "Oh, Frederick l" sobbed the agitated girl; "that's it." It 1" said I; " what, my angel? Do you really know what it is?" "Don't be alarmed, Frederick," said Adelgitha, "I wish you had known it before." ' Known what!"I exclaimed. "Known it, dearest," said she, crying afresh. "What is the noise " said I, " and what has it to do with our destinies?" "I feared it would have a serious effect upon you," replied Miss Row- bottom; " but no your mind and feelings soar above it." "It!" cried I, impatiently, " but what is it? what does it mean? what is the noise " "My leg, Frederick," said Adelgitha, dropping her lovely face upon my shoulder; which I declare upon my word, gentlemen, was as wet through with her tears as if I had been caught in a shower of rain. "Your leg, dearest?" said I. "Yes, the result of that dreadful fall from my horse, of which you were, of course, aware," said Adelgitha. "The torture of amputation was nothing to the dread I felt lest it should alter your affection for me; but I thought I knew you better." "I thought, gentlemen," said Lackington, "I should have died.

Shortly after, Providence was pleased, in its mercy to the young woman, to call the old man to another and a better world. But ere he took his final departure from this, he summoned his young wife to his bedside and announced to her that he was dying; whereupon she wept bitterly. Wycherly lifted him- self up in the bed, and gazing with tender emotion on his weeping wife, said:-"My dearest love, I have a solemn promise to exact from you i    before I quit your side for ever here below. Will you assure me my wishes will be attended to by you, however great the sacrifice you will !    be called on to make f" Horrid ideas of suttees, of poor Indian widows being called on to ex- pire on funeral pyres, with the bodies of their deceased lords and masters, flashed across the brain of the poor woman. With a convulsive effort and desperate resolution, she gasped out an assurance that his commands, however dreadful they might be, should be obeyed.  *    Then Wycherly, with a ghastly smile, said, in a low and solemn voice: l     ' My beloved wife, the parting request I have to make of you is-that when I am gone--(here the poor woman sobbed and cried most vehe- mently) when I am in my cold grave-(Mrs. Wycherly tore her hair)- when I am laid low--(the disconsolate wife roared with grief)-when I am no longer a heavy -burden and a tie on you-(' Oh, for Heaven's sake!' howled Mrs. W., ' what am I to do?')--I command you, my dear young wife-(' yes, y-e-s, love,' sobbed Mrs. W.)-on pain of incur- ring my malediction--(' y-e-s, dear,' groaned the horror-stricken wife) -never to marry an old man again!" Mrs. Wycherly dried her eyes, and, in the most fervent manner, pro- mised that she never would-and that faithful woman kept her word for life.

THERE was an old and wretched man, Who swept a crossing where It was my wont each morn to passe In weather foul or fair. And in the rain, or scorching sun, Or 'neaih the blast so keen, In tattered garb, and wretched shoes, This aged man was seen. He seemed-so bent with misery, I thought as I passed by, That it must be a happy thing For such a man to die I And when I chanced to meet his eye, He looked so wan and pale, I never read in any book So piteous a tale I And then, again, I inly said, Wit4 many a rising sigh: Great God, oh! what a happy thing, For such a man to die I It was upon that joyful day, When sabbath bells do ring, And call us all, both old and young, To praise our Heavenly King: That as, with contrite steps and sad, To prayer I slowly trod, This poor old man was also bent To go and praise his God. But what a change I his look was glad, And he was cleaner drest, His face was bright with thankfulness: He seemed so truly blest I It was my chance that morn to stand Near him in the church aisle, And in each pause to catch his voice, And see his happy smile. His eye was lit with light from heaven- Praise came with every breath- And in his face-I saw the hope. That triumphs over death.

MANY a good story is spoiled in the telling, at times, to the great sur- prise of the teller, who forgets the point, or, by the blunder of a word, blunts it so as to kill its effect. That old story of Jones and Brown's coat-tail is a fair specimen. Jones had told Brown that his coat was too short. "Ah!" said Brown, "it will be long enough before I get another," at which the bystanders laughed applaudingly. Jones tried it on-the joke, not the coat-the next day in another company. "Oh l' says he, " did you hear what a good joke Brown made yesterday? I told him his coat was too short, and he said it would be a great while before he got another." Nobody laughed; but some one remarked that he didn't see the wit of it exactly, and Jones said he could now hardly see it himself.

The friend was a wag, and stopping the wagoner, he said to him, as he laid his hand on the tire of one of the wheels, "My friend, you must have come a long distance to-day i" "Yes, I have; but how do you know anything about it, I should like to know@" "Oh, I know you must, because your wheels are so shockingly tired!" The wagoner laughed and drove on. The Professor, to whom jesting was not familiar, ventured a few days afterwards to repeat the conver- sation, and was mortified to perceive that the story was received with profound silence, as he concluded by saying that his friend replied to the wagoner's demand, "How do you know anything about it?" "Oh, I know you must, your wheels are so completely exhausted." We had a sad accident here last spring when we were getting down our lumber. It turned out better than it threatened at one time, for we had very nearly lost one of our cleverest fellows. Jim and Sam Robert- son were brothers and partners in business. It is a mighty ticklish business to go down the rapids of the Delaware with a raft-very par- ticularly so, if one's head is dizzy from the imbibition of too much spirituous liquor Jim was always afraid of getting the water into him, never of getting into the water himself. "Water," he would say, "is well enough for logs to float in, and in a drought may do upon a pinch for occasional drink; but for a steady drink give me rum." I have heard of others who held to the same opinion. There was a will case tried out here at the county court, where a hard, old customer had made his testament on his dying bed. The question to be determined referred to the old man's being in his right mind. One of his neighbors appeared as a witness, and swore that he was sensible to the last. "How do you know that?" asked the counsel. "'Cause his last words was,' Give me some more rum l' and that's what I call being sensible to the last." Jim Robertson, of whom I was going to tell you a story, was in the tavern at Lackawaxen last fall, and was shocked at the miserable milk- and-water stuff they gave him for rum. He drank a glass of it, and with a big oath demanded, "Do you call that rum?" Thle tavern-keeper knew it was more than half water, and inquired, "Do you find it too weak, Jim?" "Weak, weak!" roared Jim, "I should say it was almost a fortnight!"  OHT-OHAT.             221 But I was to mention a disaster by which he nearly lost his life. He and his brother Sam were on their way down the river, on a raft, and Jim was just a little too drunk for safe navigation in bad water, when he slipped through, and would have been drowned but for the energy of his sobered brother, who rushed to the end of the raft and seized him by the hair as he came out. But the current was strong, and the strength of Sam was fast giving way; he was just thinking of letting go his hold and leaving his brother to that most unfitting of all burials fo, him-a watery grave--when the drowning man got his mouth out of the water, and now for the first time opened it, shouting, "Hold on, Sam! hang on! I'll treat, I vow I will!" f The appeal and the pledge were stimulating. Sam made one mor pull and brought his brother on the raft. THrE Rev. Dr. B-- was what was commonly termed a " popular preacher;" not, however, by drawing on his own stores, but by the knack which he possessed of appropriating the thoughts and language of the great divines who had gone before him, to his own use, and by a  skilful splicing nd dovetailing of passages, so as to make a whole. For tunately for him, those who composed his audience were not very deeply skilled in pulpit lore, and with such he passed for a wonder of erudition. It happened, however, that the doctor was detected in hit literary larcenies. One Sunday, a grave old gentleman seated himself close to the pulpit, and listened with profound attention. - The doctor had scarcely finished his third sentence before the old gentleman said, loud enough to be heard by those near him, "that's Sherlock." The doctor frowned, but went on. He had not proceeded much further, when his grave auditor broke out with, " that's Tillotson." The doctor bit his lips and paused, but went on. At a third exclamation of ,' that'c Blair," the doctor lost all patience, and leaning over the side of the pul- pit, he cried, "Fellow, if you do not hold your tongue, you shall be turned out." Without altering a muscle, the old gentleman, looking the doctor full in the face, said, " that's his own."

COLD JANUARIES. 1792.-From the 6th to the 30th of January, both days included, the temperature did not rise above the freezing point for twenty-five con- secutive days. The lowest temperature was two degrees above zero. The cold filled one circle of 360 hours, and twenty-one sections of a second circle. This cold term was immediately preceded and succeeded by rain. On the 19th of the month, ice lodged in the East river, and people crossed upon it to and from Brooklyn. 1810.-A cold term commenced on the 18th of January, and continued to the 24th. Lowest temperature zero. The cold filled twelve sections of the circle. The term was immediately preceded and succeeded by rain. The temperature on Thursday, the 18th, at 2 P M., was at 40 degrees above zero, and next morning at sunrise was at'zero-a fall of "degrees in nineteen hours, and one of the most extraordinary changes noted in the United States in the present century. The 19th was known as " the cold Friday.' I was in camp in a northern forest at that time. The snow was six feet deep, and the mercury in the thermometer solid. All the night of the 18th, the trees in the forest kept up a continued detonation, like the discharge of volleys of musketry, cracking and splitting with the sudden and great change; and the ice of a neighbor- ing lake, about midnight, was burst from one extremity to the other by the cold producing a crack of miles in length. The sound from this rupture was like-the discharge of heavy ordnance continued, and the ground was violently shaken for a great distance. Many trees were killed by the frost. 1820-21.-A cold term commenced on the 30th of December, 1820, and continued to the 27th of January, 1821-more than twenty-eight consecutive days, and filling one entire circle and twenty-eight sections of a second circle. The lowest temperature was seven degrees below zero. There was a perturbation on the 13th of the month, when a misty rain fell while the temperature was three degrees below the freezing point, and became ice ad it fell. The wind was easterly.

On the 26th, thousands of persons crossed the North river to and from New York to Paulus Hook. The ice was crossed at the Narrows, to and from Staten to Long Island, and from Staten Island to New York. The ice broke up at the Narrows on the 30th of January, when the ice embargo on vessels was removed. Rain fell on the 29th of December, immediately preceding the com- mencement of the cycle, and it closed with rain on the 27th Janual which commenced falling when the temperature was eleven degrees below the freezing point of Fahrenheit, and continued for hours while it remained below that line. The Threat and no Threat-A frolicsome youth who had been riding out, on approaching Merton College, which he had never before visited, alighted, and, sans ceremonie, put his horse into a field thereto belonging. Word was immediately sent to him that he had no right to put his horse there, as he did not belong himself to the college. The youth, however, took no notice of the warning, and the master of the college sent his man to him, bidding him say, if he continued his horse there, he would cut off his tail. "Say you sol" said the wag; "go tell your master, if he cuts off my horse's tail, I will cut off his ears.' The. servant returning, told his master what he said. Whereupon he was sent back to bring the person to him; who appearing, the master said, "How now,'sir, what mean you by that menace you sent me?" "Sir," said the other, "I threatened you not: for I only said, if you cut off my horse's tail, I would cut off his ears." "PETER, my poy, does you understands de seventh commandments ' "Yaw."

"Why, thou ninny," replied the man, "thou canst not be such a simpleton; look at me again, what likeness canst thou see I'll show thee a horse's trick, however." And giving him a sudden kick, and a well applied blow, he left him sprawling- in the gutter, and ran off, amidst the laughter of the bystanders.

The Advantages of Art.--In Europe the world of art is second only to the world of literature, a mighty domain, divided into several vast provinces: and it has an advantage over literature in its universality- that is to say, in this important circumstance, that its productions are equally intelligible to men of all languages, and when a Roman or Swede produces a fine statue, its beauty needs no translation to make it speak to the minds and the hearts of people of other lands. 10' .  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7492-00000120"/> 226           C  I T-C n A T. A BUNCH OF SAYINGS, PASSION evaporates by words, as grief does by tears. He that swells in prosperity, will shrink in adversity. It is a maxim of prudence, to leave things before they leave us. As a great body is not without a like shadow, neither is any eminent virtue without eminent detraction. None should despair, because God can help them; and none should presume, because God can cross them. Wisdom is always satisfied with its present enjoyments, because it frees a man from all anxious cares about futurities. Hopes and disappointments are the lot and entertainment of human life; the one serves to keep us from presumption, the other from despair. The best kindness of a proud man has often such a mixture of arro- gancy, that his greatest obligations are rendered ungracious to a worthy receiver. There is a medium between an excessive diffidence and too universal a confidence, If we have no foresight, we are surprised; if we are too nice, we are miserable. That man hath but an ill life on't, who feeds himself with the faults and frailties of other people. Were not curiosity the purveyor, detrac- tion would soon be starved into a tameness. There is seldom anything uttered in malice, which turns not to the hurt of the speaker. "WHY do you look so sad, Laura, dear " " Because, love, they say pink bonnets will be worn this season, and you know they are so very unsuitable to a girl of sentiment."

DOUGLAS JERROLD is the kingof grim fun-his laugh is sardonic-his playful pats are dislocators. Some of his most successful retorts were made at the Museum Club, for it required whiskey-toddy to make him human. He always gave us the idea of a jesting Moloch, since the im- molation of a human humbug was necessary to his complete enjoyment. A great egotist himself, he would endure " no brother near his throne." One evening, John Abraham Heraud, the poet, was boring the company with his wonderful epics, among which the Judgment of the Flood, and the Descent into Hell, were conspicuous. Turning to Jerrold, who was chairman of the Club, he said, "Jerrold, did you ever read my Descent into Hell!" "No," retorted the other, "but I should very much like to see it!" Upon another occasion, when Albert Smith, the Mont Blanc traveller, had been boasting of his intimacy with the most celebrated French authors, he told his grim listener that ".Lamartine and he rowed in the same boat." "  Indeed (retorted Jerrold) but I should say," pointing to his head, "  with very different sort of sculls." James, the novelist, came one night in the way of his repartee, for, upon the pompous owner of the Two Horsemen saying, that "He was the Victor Hugo of England," Jerrold exclaimed, "The Victor Nogo, you mean, James!" His criticism on Browning was equally characteristic. When recover- ing from a fit of severe sickness he had been prohibited reading, or in any way exercising his mind. While Mrs. Jerrold was away on some visits a parcel arrived from London. Jerrold opened it and commenced reading Browning's Sordello. When his wife returned, he placed the mysterious volume in the hands of his wife, saying, "Here is a new poem by Robert Browning. Read this page." Mrs. Jerrold took the book, and after going over a page several times threw it down on the table, exclaiming, "Why, Douglas, it's all gibber- ish 1 I can't understand a line of it!" "Thank heaven!" cried the delighted wit, "then I am not an idiot!" The alarmed author, not being able to understand the poet, had till then been under the idea that during his illness his intellect had perished. As a set-off to this joke at Browning's peculiar style, we ought to mention, however, that Mrs ra Marston, the dramatists wife, has declared to us " that Sordello was not half difficult enough to please her!"But who ever yet did please a woman I  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7492-00000121"/> 228           ol IT - C 1 h T'. Jerrold once went to hear the Rev. Robt. Montgomery preach. -Ie never tired of repeating the commencement of that strange parson's ser- mon. It was in these words: "My beloved brethren, why did the Almighty create Satan?" This being a poser far above his congrega- tion's power to answer, he answered for them by saying, "To place Himself in a moral dilemma I Why, then, did the Almighty create our Saviour? To release Himself from this dilemma 1"Jerrold waited for no more-this was enough to last him all his life.  BEFORE you commit suicide, take an emetic.

Why, the grief which bowed Stubbs to the ground for two long weeks has fled and gone.

On Sunday last, a gentleman, accom- panied by his little girl of some five years of age, strayed into one of the aforesaid churches, and his fine voice materially assisted the choir in getting through "Winchester."  Just before the benediction, the little girl, observing the fine effect produced by her parent on the occu- pants of the surrounding pews, cried out in an audible voice, "Papa, please sing ' Villikins and his Dinah!"' It is needless to add that the benediction was unheeded.

A LETTER writer from Cincinnati, Ohio, says that the common people of that city are those who kill pigs now.

MArrEl:W MALONEY, better known by the boys of the mill as "Father Mat," on returning from work one evening, was met at the gate by Biddy, his better half, in a high state of excitement. "Mat," says she, " there's a strange cat in the cabin." "Cast her out thin, an' don't be botherin' me about the baste.' "Faix, an' rI've been sthrivin' to do that same for the matther of ten minits past, but she's jist beyant me rache, behint the big rid chest in A?   the corner. Will yez be afther helpin' me to dhrive her out, Mat?" Xi! "To be sure I will, bad luck to the consate she has for me house; show her to me, Biddy, till I tache her the rispict that's due a man in his own house-to be takin' possission widout as much as by yer lave, the thafe o' the world 1" Now Mat had a special antipathy for cats, and never let pass an opportunity to kill one. This he resolved to do in the present case, and instantly formed a plan for the purpose. Perceiving but one mode of egress for the animal, he says to Biddy-- "Have yez iver a male bag in the house, me darlint " "Divil a wan is there, Mat. Yez tuk it to the mill wid yez to bring home chips wid, this mornin'." "Faix, an' I did, and there it is yit, thin. TWell, have yez nothing at all in the house that will tie up like a bag, Biddy?" : "Troth, an' I have, Mat, there's me Sunday pitticoat-ye can dhraw the strings close at the top, an' sure it will do betther nor lettin' the cat be lavin' yez." "Biddy darlint, yez a jewel to be thnnkin' o' that same; be afther bringin' it to me." Biddy brought the garment, and when the strings were drawn close it made a very good substitute for a meal bag, and Mat declared it was "illegant." So holding it close against the edge of the chest, he took a look behind and saw a pair of bright eyes glaring at him. "An' is it there ye are, ye devil Be out o' that now; bad luck to all yer kin, ye shavin' vagabone ye. Bedad, an' ye won't lave me house thin at all wid perlite axin'? Yer self-will bates a pig's intirely. Biddy, have yez any hot wather in the house!" "Yis, I've a plinty, Mat; the tay-kettle's full uv it."

"Hould 'im close, Mat; here goes the wather." Dash went the water, and out jumped the animal into Mat's trap. "Arrah, be the howly poker, I have 'im in, Biddy," says Mat, draw- ing close the folds of the garment; " now, bad cess to yez, ye, thafe, it's nine lives ye have, is it Be afther axin' me forgiveness, for the thavin' ye have been doin' in me house, for I'm thinkin' the nine lives ye have won't save ye now, any way. Biddy, saize hoult of the poker, an' whin I'll shoulder the haythen ye'll bate the daylights out of'imL" Mat threw the bundle over his shoulder, and told Biddy to play "St. Patrick's day in the morning" on it. Biddy struck about three notes of that popular Irish air, and suddenly stopped, exclaiming- "What smills so quare, Mate It's takin' me brith away wid the power uv it. Och, murther, Mat; sure an' ye have the divil in the sack" "Bate the ould haythen, then; yez 'ill niver have a betther chance. Bate the horns off 'im; lather 'im like blazes, me darlintl" "Augh!" says Biddy, "I'm faintin' wid the power uv 'im. Cast 'im off yez, Mat!" "Howly St. Pather!" says 'Mat, throwing down the sack; "Biddy, the baste is a pole-catl Lave the house or yez 'ill be kilt intirely. Murther and turf, how the haythen smills. Och,-Biddy Maloney, a purty kittle o' fish yez made of it, to be sure, to be mistakin' that little divil for a harrumless cat!" "Mat, for the love o' God, if yez convanient to the door, be afther openin' it, for I'm narely choked wid 'im. Och, Biddy Maloney, bad luck to yez for leavin' ould Ireland, to be murthered in this way. Howly Mary, pertiet me! Mat, I'm clane kilt intirely--take me out o' this!" Mat drew her out-doors, and then broke for the pump like a quarter- horse, closely followed by Biddy. I "Shure, that little villain bates the divil intirely; he's ruined me house, an' kilt Biddy, an' put me out o' consate wid mesilf for a month to come.- Och, the desaivin' vagabone, bad luck to him," and Mat plunged his head into the horse-trough up to his shoulders. "Get out o' that, Mat, I'm narely blind," and Biddy went under water. "Och, the murtherin' baste," says Biddy, sputtering the water out of her mouth, " me best petticoat is spoilt intirely. Mat Maloney, divil a trap will I iver help yez to sit for a cat agin." "Don't throub!e yersilf, Mistress Maloney, ye've played the divil as it is. Niver fear me axin' a hap'orth o' yer assistance.

Things were turned out of doors, Biddy's petticoat buried, the bed, which fortunately escaped, moved to a near neighbor's, the stove moved outside, and for a week they kept house out of doors, by which time, by dint of scrubbing, wash- ing, and airing, the house was rendered once more habitable, but neither lat nor Biddy has forgotten the " strange cat."

"Yes, Mas'r Tom." A few days after, Massa Tom was provided with a fine Newfoundland Not long after he took the dog out for an airing, and chanced to meet your friend G. The dog became the subject of conversation, and extol- ling his new acquisition's good qualities, Tom said: "Just see, G., how he fetches and carries," throwing his hat-one of Genin's best-on the grass, which there is green all the year. "There, Boatswain, take it 1" Boatswain did take it, and without wagging his tail even, leaped the iron railing of the square and disappeared. Since that time Tom has heard neither of dog nor hat.

C H'T-CHAT.             235 QUr=s A ROMANTIC STORY. A w4I'rzs for an Indiana paper relates the followipg as true, and states that the affair occurred at Cincinnati: "About twenty years ago--as the story goes-a man and wife, of prominence by fashionable position, who had been wedded long enough to be blessed (?) by a female babe, discovered that they did not love one another as they should, and therefore separated for ever. The wife took the child and sought a home in an Eastern city, where her parents resided, resuming her maiden name, and giving to her child the same. After a divorce had been agreed upon and obtained by due course of law, the lady married, and the little girl was sent to a relative in the interior of New York State, where her education was attended to, and where she lived until a few months since. The man has continued to reside in the West, and being young when separated from his wife, of a hale constitution, and particularly careful to remove from his countenance all traces of time's foot-prints, has kept up a very youthful appearance, considering his age. Being in affluent circumstances, of good address, and decidedly agreeable in all the niceties that combine to stamp the gentleman of fashionable life, he was always regarded as a desirable prize by designing mammas. Never- theless, he had escaped all their snares, to the great annoyance of pretty girls and charming widows, who really thought it was the duty of Mr. --- to get married.  It might have been a settled aversion to the sex, or it might be attributed to his early lessons--yet it was a fact, he did not marry. "But, not to be too prolix, we'll cut off some of the little unimportant items, and proceed to the story. During last June, a Miss J---- arrived here from the East, on a visit to a relative, who had been a resident of the Queen City but a few months. The second week of her Western sojourn threw her in company with the grass widower of twenty years' standing, who showed by his attention that he was more than usually impressed by the charms of the fair stranger. Every evening found him at her side, and she was thought not to be entirely insensible to his charms of person and mind.  A month glided away-a month of court- ship, which was carefully noted and meaningly winked at by her rela- tive. At length her hand was asked in marriage, and the matter referred to her connexion. "He seemed to favor the project, and appointed an interview for the trio the same evening. They met in the parlor, when a more formal  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7492-00000125"/> 236           a I I T - aI X T. solicitation for her hand was made, and while the ardent suitor was waiting with breathless anxiety for the answer that was to seal his fate, the young lady was led forward and presented to her own father --the lover. "It is needless to add that-both were astounded; however, it resulted in good. The father has settled a liberal fortune upon the daughter, and ere this both are in Paris, preparatory to making the tour of Europe. This romance of everyday life is but another instance of truth oftentimes being stranger than fiction." THB Alabama "Skeeter;" thus wickedly speaks of reporters for the press: "( If you want to rejoice the internal soul of a reporter, tell him that six women and seven children have just been torn asunder limb from limb in a house around the next corner-that blood is gushing from all the windows and doors-that a steamboat has just' bust' and killed all on board-that the Rev. Dr. Exegesis has cut his own throat -and that an awful and impenetrable mystery surrounds everything." A SmOOR, who had hired a violin player to perform him some airs, on being asked what tune he preferred, replied--"( Nep-tune, you lubber, and so does every jolly tar." The Little One's Welcome.-Passing down town the other even- ing as the stars were beginning to blink, we saw a hard-toiling merchant enter his cheerful home. He was met at the door by a fairy little orea- ture, who threw herself into his arms and exclaimed- "Oh, I love you" - What sweet words, thought we. , Thousands have spoken them; but none, we trust, more sincerely. Yes, spoken them, some only to deceive. "I love you." What heart would not throw off its weight of sadness at such sweet words? And who would not feel well repaid after years of weary toil and trouble, to have them spoken himI Oh I who would not  "I love you." ' Sweet words, fresh from a child's young heart-the expression of a sunny young spirit's affection. Angels record them, and witness their sincerity.

A MEMBEr elect of the lower chamber of the Legislature of Arkansas, was persuaded, by some wags of his neighborhood, that if he did not reach the State House at ten o'clock on the day of assembling, he could not be sworn, and would lose his seat. He immediately mounted, with hunting-frock, rifle, and bowie-knife, and spurred till he got to the door of the Capitol, where he hitched his nag. A crowd was in the chamber of the lower house, on the ground floor, walking about with their hats on, and smoking cigars. These he passed, ran up stairs into the senate chamber, set his rifle against the wall, and bawled out: "Strangers, whar's the man that swears me in " at the same time taking out his credentials. "Walk this way," said the clerk, who was at the moment igniting a real Principe, and he was sworn without inquiry. When the teller came to count noses, he found that there was one senator too many present. The mistake was soon discovered, and the huntsman was informed that he, did not belong there. "Fool who with your corn bread 9" he roared; " you can't flunk this child, nohow you can fix it-I'm elected to this ere legislature, and I'll go agin all banks and eternal improvements, and if there's any of your oratory gentlemen wants to get skinned, jest say the word, and I'll light upon you like a nigger on a woodchuck. My constituents sent me here, and if you want to floor this two-legged animal, hop on, jest as soon as you like, for though I'm from the back country, I'm a little smarter than any other quadruped you can turn out of this drove." After this admirable harangue, he put his bowie-knife between his teeth, and took up his rifle with, "Come here, old Suke, stand by me 1" at the same time pointing it at the chairman, who, however, had seen such people before. After some expostulation, the man was persuaded that he belonged to the lower chamber, upon which he sheathed his knife, flung his gun on his shoulder, and, with a profound congee, remarked: "Gentlemen, I beg your pardon.  But if I didn't think that lower room was a groggery, may I be shot." Keen.-That was a keen reply of the buxom lassie to the little pigmy of a man who solicited a matrimonial connexion--"Oh no," said the fair lady, "I can't think of it for a moment.

What Attracts Young Men.--Men are not attracted by highly accomplished women, so much as by truly natural and artless women- women sufficiently well educated to be able to speak and write accu- rately, and free from fashionable follies and vices--women, in brief, who are beautiful in their simplicity. - AT a marriage ceremony, celebrated in the M. E. Church in Balti- more, a few days since, the bride was dressed in snow-white satin, the first bridesmaid was attired in deep blue, and the second in red silk. AT a hotel, the other evening, a young and fully moustached dandy, from a certain city, was seated at the tea-table, at rather a late hour, when a bar-keeper came in and took a seat opposite. The dandy dropped his knife and fork, tipped back his chair, gazed at the bar- keeper, and exclaimed: "Fellah, does the servants sup with a gentle- man in this house " "No, sir," was the reply. "Are you not the bar-keeper " '; Yes, sir.' "Well, a bar-keeper is a 'help,' as much as the scrub girL" "True?" replied the man of the toddy-stick, " but I did not enter the hall until I looked in and saw there was not a gentleman at the table;. Ahem f' A  ,ASHmNGTON letter-writer tells the following, in speaking of the presence of Philosopher Greeley at the Federal Capital: A trio of Irish servants were busy talking politics in the corner of the reading-room (Irish servants are great politicians here) when one of them suddenly exclaimed- "Be jabers, boys, an' there's ould Greeley!" "Where!" exclaimed his companions, with as much interest in their looks as they would naturally exhibit on being told that St. Patrick or Bishop Hughes was before them.

The Hibernians gazed curiously and intensely at Horace for an instant, when the youngest of them, apparently a late importation, with wonder in his voice, observed; "Sure an' he's a white man." "Av eoorse he's a white man," said the first speaker, in a patronizing :tone, as though Horace and he were the greatest of cronies. "Well, be me sowl, I've been desaved in the owld fellow intirely," continued the other, "I thought he was a nagur."

A WELL known Providence sporting character tried his luck in that city the other day, and found it bad. The bank refused to discount for him, and his deposits were exhausted. On turning his back upon the scene of operations, a sympathizing friend said to him--"Tom, you are broke." "Yes," said Tom, with a sigh, " and so dead broke that if steamboats were selling at a cent apiece, I couldn't buy a gangway plank." PERHAPS, after all, says Punch, there is no great absurdity in the notion of female physicians. All physicians, except those who practise gratuitously, may be designated by the word female spelt with another e on the first syllable; and there are not a few of whom that is all that can be said. If the head of woman is not calculated for the formation of diagnosis, she can, at least, shake it in a difficult case as effectually as a man can; and having a softer and more musical voice than the masculine, she is better qualified than the most of men are for that large part of medical practice which consists in whispering comfort to invalids. "s ABOUT the time Pierce was nominated," said Douglasa, "I was in New Hampshire, and, with a great portion of the American people, I felt curious to know who Franklin Pierce was.

I asked him if he could tell me who this General Pierce was. He replied: "Oh, Frank Pierce--Oh yes, I know Frank.

He did not discover his mistake till he received a stinging box on the ear from the hand of the offended lady, and the whole jury burst into a roar of laughter. A LADY brought a child to a physician to consult about its precarious state of health. Among other things, she inquired if he did not think the Springs would be useful. "Certainly, madam," replied the doctor, as he eyed the child, and then took a pinch of snuff. I have not the least hesitation in recom- mending the Springs, and the sooner you apply the remedy, the better." "You really think it would be good for the dear little thing, don't you 8" ( Upon my word, it's the best remedy I know." "What Springs would you recommend?" "Any will do, madam, where you can get a plenty of soap and water!" "Is your house a warm one, landlord!" asked a man in search of a tenement., "It ought to be; the painter gave it two coATs recently!" -was the reply.

You must know, then, that it is the most important-epoch in a young lady's life, and is often deferred till a late period, because mammas are unwilling to be eclips- ed by the more youthful graces of 'their offspring.  Another reason is this, that the period in which they figure among their rivals (all striving to reach the goal of matrimony) is dated from the time of coming out,or first introduction. But to make amends for this cruel banishment, they are taken as children to balls, theatres, and concerts, and anywhere else that their fancy and inclination may lead them. It was my fate a few nights since to be present at a children's ball; and more vanity, airs, and graces, were displayed amongst these pigmy performers than I ever saw in any assemblage of full-grown veterans of fashion. One instance particularly struck me. An interesting little girl, about eight years old, who seemed extremely anxious to join the dancers, was sitting near me : a little fellow about her own age was brought up to her as a part- ner; she refused dancing with him; the lady of the house tried to per- suade her, but she continued obstinate, nor would she assign a reason for her refusal: she colored violently, and the tears stood in her eyes. At last the lady took her by the hand and led her from the room, deter- mined to ascertain why she had objected to the partner allotted her. And what do you think it was, my dear Theresa I She declared she could not dance with such a baby, who had a frill round his throat; she would have a bigger boy, with a collar Thus you see that vanity springs from the very cradle; and can it be surprising that deceit of all sorts is practised, when girls are formally ushered into society with the avowed intention of securing a husband.

She was dug out of her snowy encrust- ment, and, shaking her feathers, amused them at home by a vivid account of what an exciting and delicious time she had had. The next day her sleigh ride terminated without any accident.

A gentleman, who was in the habit of larding his discourse with the expression "I say," having been informed by a friend that a cer- tain individual had made ill-natured remarks upon this peculiarity, took the opportunity of addressing him in the following amusing style of rebuke:- "I say, sir, I hear say you say, ' I say,' at every word I say.

It is when we are perfectly convinced of our being in the right that we are the most incorrigible in our mis- deeds." ANOTHER SELL---MADNESS WITH A METHOD IN IT. ON Wednesday last, a neatly dressed, very prepossessing, and pretti- ly spoken woman, somewhere between sixteen and twenty-five years of age, drove up to the door of the Tnsane Hospital, over which Dr. presides, and inquired for that gentleman. She was ushered into the reception room, and awaited the coming of the Doctor, with an air of nonchalance which rather fascinated the servant, who looked upon her with eyes of admiration and unfeigned pleasure. When left alone she amused herself-a woman always will-in gratifying her curi- osity by inspecting the various articles in the room critically and tho- roughly. The Doctor being announced, she received him with one of those bewildering smiles which some women know   so well how to bestow, and whose influence no man of feeling could possibly resist. The doctor welcomed her with more than usual cordiality, and soon learned the object of her visit. She had come, she said, with a glance full of melancholy, and a tone of more than usual tenderness, to ascertain of the doctor in person, whether she could secure private quarters for her husband, who was subject to intense fits of aberration of mind, but whose conduct towards her, " bitter cruel as it was," could not alienate her love for him, which was the all-pervading passion of her soul. He had grown so violent of late that she wished to have him secured from violence to himself as well as to her (and here the charming creature-wept for some moments), and if she could make an arrangement with the doctor, she urged that it should be kept as private as his most secret thoughts, and her hus- band beyond the scrutiny of visitors.  And then she said her heart would break, she knew it would, and wept bitterly and long. The doctor, as all who know his kind and tender disposition will readily imagine, was not insensible to the touching recital of his visitor, and with that frankness which always characterized him, he promised  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7492-00000130"/> 246 0-         I IT-O  AT. to comply with her wishes, to- give her husband a private apartment and his special care-and also to shield him from the gaze of curiosity- seekers who run down public institutions. The lady was not long in arranging terms; she was not long in ex- pressing her thanks, intermingled with tears; she was not long in set- tling the details of her husband's confinement; she was not very long, in short, in taking her leave. And as she stepped into her carriage, aided by the kind hand of the doctor, she turned her beautiful face to- wards him, and cast upon him a glance that was full of tenderness and solicitude,and inspired him anew with- Admiration and pity. - The carriage drove away, the doctor's eyes followed amid the clouds of dust which gathered in its wake, until it was nearly lost to view. Down the bridge, along the crowded thoroughfare, over the pebbled way of Chestnut street, to a fashionable, if not the fashionable jewelry establishment of the city, the carriage paused, -its sweet and solitary inmate glancing out and smiling within, and growing radiant with a brilliant thought which requires another paragraph to learn. She alighted and glided into the bazaar of gold and precious stones, with all the statelhness of- a queen. One or two of the gentlemanly attendants ran to-learn her wish. She wanted to select a set of silver-ware, not too plain, something neat, tasteful, and beautiful The various patterns were shown, and a set valued at $500 was selected by the lady of stately tread. She de- sired the articles put up, a bill made out, and she would settle it. Her wishes were complied with, and the lady took out her elegant porte-mon- naie, but, alas! there were only about $40 in it. She had picked up the wrong porte-monnaie, she said, with bewitching sweetness, and she was vexed at her stupidity. She, however, could arrange it. She was the wife of Dr. --, the principal physician of the Insane Hospital, and she desired her attendant to accompany her to that place, where she would pay him the $500 at once. Who could resist such a request from a beautiful woman-a request spoken as much with the eyes as with the voice? Not the clerk, cer- tainly. The two got into the carriage together, and back it whirled to the hospital. The lady jumped out, and was warmly greeted by the doctor, who was at the entrance. "Doctor, this is my husband," said she, assuming an air sweet and sorrowful   -    CHT-COHa T.          247 The poor attendant started. He was struck aghast. He could not fathom her meaning. "What did you say!" B "Doctor, this is my husband; please take him in charge." i"The devil, ma'am, I'm not your husband! What do you mean." Bursting into tears she sobbed aloud, " he has another spasm-he has another attack. Oh! doctor, if you have pity in your soul, secure him, and save yourself and me from violence." In vain the poor fellow attempted to explain. He was hurried along the corridor and into a room, and confined securely-the woman all the while following close behind, weeping as though her heart would break. The doctor and the lady returned to the reception-room, and the latter, after giving the other an outline of the peculiarities of her alleged hus- band's attacks, together with some directions in reference to the care which she desired to have bestowed upon him, left, promising to return again in a few days. And away whirled the carriage, the silver ware and the lady, none of whom have been heard of since. The poor attendant was confined for three days before any one about the establishment could be induced to convey a letter to his employers, who all the time were suspecting his honesty, and preparing to adver- tise him. Upon the receipt of the letter, it did not take them long to discover that he had been sold decidedly; the poor attendant was satisfied upon his arrival at the hospital, that he had been sold most sorrowfully in- deed. And here, we think, we will end the story, which was talked over in fashionable circles for four days after with many a hearty laugh. A Live Clothes-Horse..-A green servant girl was told by her mistress, to wash her clothes and hang them on a horse to dry. Biddy O'Flanagan having washed the articles, suddenly disappeared, and in about an hour returned, leading a donkey. "What on airth," says the lady. "1 do you want that for?" "Oh, sure," cried Biddy, "I could not find a horse, but I've got a donkey, and won't that do as well?"

A DREAM OF FIRE. A LADY who was "subject to eating pork chops" for supper, having one night eaten rather more than usual, woke up after her first nap, and cried "Fs mE," at the top of her voice. It unfortunately happened that a fire company was passing at the time, and hearing the shout they commenced playing upon the window where the sounds came from. When the lady awoke there were six inches of water in her bedroom! A terrible warning to the eaters of pork! By the way, Mrs. Radcliffe, the celebrated authoress of "The Myste- ries of Udolpho," "The Romance of the Forest," and other spectral romances, invariably eat underdone pork chops when she wanted to compose anything of a startling character. Who would believe that there was such inspiration in rare porkl It reminds us of the epitaph, "Oh, rare Ben Jonson!" That digestion has a great influence upon the mind is evident. We have the confession of Dryden, that when. he wished to be more than usually poetical he took aperients, and was bled some ten or twenty ounces, as the case might be. Some of our best poems owe their spirit to brandy and water. Byron drank so much gin and water during the composition of "Don Juan" that Leigh Hunt declares the verses smell of that vulgar, but, it must be confessed, rather popular beverage. An excellent, but still rather poor joke, is related of Sheridan Knowles, who dips into Scotch ale whenever he is writing a drama. These " alecyon days" are, however, all over now, for he is a Methodist parson, and damns his congregation with as much nonchalance as the public used to condemn his worst plays. While he was writing "John of Procida," his demands for more ale were so incessant that Macready   CHT-OHAT.             249 grimly said, {"Knowles,. one would think you were going to write a more ale drama!" Dickens has a fling at the expense of the men who, when they are put hors de combat by too much champagne, always lay it upon the salmon. A recent experiment on Billecart's salmon champagne has convinced us that the excuse, so much quizzed by the famous Boz, is a genuine one. "MLUONS of money for an inch of time," cried Elizabeth, the gifted but vain and ambitious queen of England, on her dying bed. Unhappy woman!--reclining upon a royal couch, with three thousand dresses in her wardrobe, a kingdom upon which the sun never sets at her feet- all is now valueless, and she shrieks in anguish, and shrieks in vain, for a single "inch of time." She had enjoyed threescore and ten years. Like too many among us, she had so devoted them to wealth, to pleasure, to pride, and to ambition, that her whole preparation for eternity was crowded into her final moments; and hence she who had wasted more than half a century, would now barter millions for an " inch of time." A Rope's End.-A Yankee Yarn.-It has been decided by Boston authorities, and no doubt to the satisfaction of all Yankee sailors, that "whipping a seaman with a rope's end is not within the meaning of the act," however it may be, we presume, within the. physical appre- hension of the sailor's flesh. That to use a rope's end is not to flog is, certainly, to draw the line very fine somewhere. "Flogging," say the Boston authorities, " is a technical naval act:" just as hanging is mere- X ly a legal formality. Flogging must be " inflicted with an instrument known as a ' cat.'"Now, a rope's end is not a cat; it is not-and any Philadelphian lawyer will prove it--it is not even a kitten.

WE hear so much about women's rights that we feel inclined to say a few words on that subject ourselves, and consequently settle the question for ever. Charles Lamb was a most determined stickler for the fair sex, and went so far as to declare, that the man who permitted a woman to clean his boots could not possibly claim any credit for gallantry. This may appear putting too fine a construction upon it, but it really does seem something of too rough a character to make females do all the hard work, from the lighting the fires to the putting them out. "A woman's work is never done," is an old proverb; and when we consult our own experience we must admit its truth. Our artist has made a couple of sketches, which place in strong con- trast the two states. In the former we have the, domestic servant, fr l:J i                        L ..-f   ..t.--. -, surrounded by her numerous implements of occupation-saucepans, coffee-pots, gridirons, coal-skuttles, blacking bottles, tea-kettles, dish covers, boots cleaned and uncleaned. Surely no slave can be in a worse    .iLj   CHT-CHAT.             251 plight than this I We are almost inclinea to the belief, that it would be better to adopt the alternative of carrying baggage after effaminate sanctities, for there would be a rest, and open air exercise. The fact is, no question is more misunderstood than that of woMAN's TRUE POSITION. While we cannot see the expediency of women mingling in the busy scenes of commerce, politics, and war, we at once admit the conventional oppression under which they labor. The injustice of man was never more exhibited than in the distribu- tion of employments What can be more detestable than the men milliners who drawl their lives away behind counters, selling lace and linens to their lady customersI Surely 'here is an -opportunity for women to earn a livelihood. Indeed, we consider it highly indecorous in any woman to buy articles of essentially female dress of a man. We now and then are met with the argument, that the objection comes from the ladies themselves, as they cannot get courteous attendance in a store from one of their own sex I We will not credit so diabolical a reflection upon the civility of one part of the fair sex, and upon the woma nly sympathy of the pther.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7492-00000133"/> 252           "I I T - TOII A T, Job Sass' Advice to Young Ladies.-Job Sass, of the Boston He- rald, has recently been addressing himself to young ladies. We have thought a few extracts from his opinions and reflections might be relish- ed by the reader, and we accordingly present them.

Railroad Poetry.-A correspondent of the Broome County Republi- can, describes his jaunt over the Syracuse and Birmingham Railroad, from Courtland, in the following poetical strain: "So much I wrote in Courtland's bounds-and would have finished there, had not the down train's whistle loud resounded through the air. So shaking Fairchild by the hand, who said come up again, I bid fare- well to every fear, and jumped upon the train. Rushing round the hill side, darting o'er the plain, over the rivers under roads, Van Bergen drove his train. The moon threw bright effulgent rays on each small ripple's crest; the river seemed a ribbon stretched across the meadow's breast; the evening wind came stealing through the car with gentle sigh, and brought a cinder from the engin spang into my eye; few and short were the prayers I said, and I spoke not a word of sorrow, but I rubbed my eye till I made it red, and knew 'twould be sore the morrow. We soon got home at the rate we ran, at an hour just right for retiring, and down from his post came the engine man, and the fireman ceased his firing. And thus I too will cease, with this moral to the tale-be always sure to 'mind your eye' when riding on a rail.'  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7492-00000134"/> 254           o ni T IC HAT. Rogarth-His Absence of Mind.-The celebrated Hogarth was one of the most absent-minded of men. Soon after he set up his car- riage, he had occasion to pay a visit to the Lord Mayor. When he went, the weather was fine; but he was detained by business till a violent shower of rain came on. Being let out of the Mansion-House by a different door from that at which he had entered, he immediately began to call for a hackney coach. Not one could be procured, on which Hogarth braved the storm, and actually reached his house in Leicester-fields without bestowing a thought on his carriage, till Mrs. Hogarth, astonished to see him so wet and hurried, asked him where he had left it.  Don't Stay Long.-"Don't stay long, husband," said a young wife tenderly, in my presence one-evening, as her husband was preparing to go out. The words themselves were insignificant, but the look of melting fondness with which-they were accompanied, spoke volumes. It told all the whole vast depths of a woman's love-of her grief when the light of his smile, the source of all her joy, beamed not brightly upon her. "Don't stay long, husband " and I fahcied I saw the loving gentle wife, sitting alone, anxiously counting the moments of her husband's absence, every few moments running to the door to see if he were in sight, and finding-that he was not, I thought I could hear her exclaim- ing in disappointed tones, " not yet-not yet." "Don't stay long, husband." And I again thought I could see the young wife, rocking nervously in the great arm-chair and weeping as though her heart would break, as her thoughtless "lord and master" prolonged his stay to a wearisome length of time. Oh, you that have wives to say--"Don't stay long," when you go forth, think of them kindly when you have mingled in the busy hive of life, and try, just a little, to make their homes and hearts happy, for they are gems too seldom replaced. You cannot find amid the pleasures of the world, the peace and joy that a quiet home blessed with such a woman's presence will afford. "Don't stay long, husband!" and the young wife's look seemed to say--" for here in your own sweet home is a loving heart, whose music is hushed when you are absent-here is a soft breast for you to lay your head upon, and here are pure lips unsoiled by sin, that will pay you with kisses for coming back soon."  ;   o H T-O I a '.          255 A SHORT LECTURE. . "A QUARTER of a century ago," it was sneeringly observed by the Edinburgh Review, " that America had not produced a book." If we had no National literature, it was no matter of surprise, as we have had other things to do. Men in new countries must have bread. To secure that, our ancestors had to wring vast acres from the grasp of 'barbarism. Now, however, it may be said that books, written here, are read with avidity on both sides of the great waters. No labors have our countrymen shrunk from-like Titans have they borne their loads. If this is true of the East, it is not less so of, the West. The only sounds that greeted the ear of the early settlers were the whoop of the savage, the howl of the -panther, and the roar of the tempest. The combined intellect and industry of France were the product of cen- turies of consecration. Our countrymen, through the predilections of Brother Jonathan, have whittled out thirty-one Constitutions, and our twenty-one millions of people are living happily together. The remote sections of our country were to be banded by the railway, -whose iron track cemented us together. The first draft upon an infant nation is upon its muscle, then upon its intellect. We have honored the first, and are diligently exercising the second. At the West, every man, in its early history, had 'to be his own defender, and every enterprise was the pro- duct of individuality. Afterwards organization steps in. The " clear- ing" on the border was the rostrum of the early orator, who, in talking face to face with his audience, became necessarily the embodiment of public sentiment. To maintain himself before the keen, penetrating sagacity, and critical acumen of the backwoodsman, the orator must ever be a man who calls things by their right names. No shuffling or evasion would be tolerated. They are accustomed to a homely range of figures. Their acquaintance with-terminology is limited. They ask every man to do his work thoroughly. Those of us who have been trained in the schools of the East, would be somewhat surprised at their homely method of imparting political information. The orator must give his auditors something beside head-work; he must show that the heart enters into his theory, to be listened to.

Barnum a Century and a half ago.-Pope, the poet, in his farce of "Half an Hour after Marriage," introduced a stuffed alligator, which of course mightily enraged the critics, and frightened the ladies. A young lady once had a beau. He was anxious to enjoy some private conversation with his charmer, but there were two children in the room. The gentleman looked to see them sent to bed, but he was disappointed. The youngest child, a little boy. about three years old, slept with the young lady, and had no idea of retiring without his bed- fellow. Stretching his chubby length upon the carpet, he watched the twain with resolutely wide-awake eyes until the bell rung for nine, when, his patience becoming exhausted, he raised his head, and said to the visitor, ' Nine o'clock is bedtime. Don't you think your mother -wants you now "' The mingling of embarrassment, vexation, and mirth produced by this hint, which was as good as a kick, was curious to be- hold.

HEIT -OEHA T.           257 NOW LITLrE EUROPEAN POLITICIANS UNDESTAND TE RUSSIAN CHARACTER THE Paris correspondent of the Manchester auardian, writing on the 24th ult.,'reports as follows:-I had a long conversation yesterday with a Russian gentleman, who is one of the most highly educated and intelligent persons I almost ever met. He was much employed by the late Czar, and has had several missions confided to him; amongst others, one to Central Asia-rather a scientific than a political one-which was much talked of at the time. I plainly told him what I told you in my letter of yesterday, touching the plans I had heard spoken of as those of the ensuing spring campaign, and the dangers which were likely to threaten Russia from the North. He did not seem either surprised or alarmed; but the substance of his whole answer to me was this;:-"I have always thought as much from the beginning; I have always felt that this war would probably be a war of invasion from one side or the other; either a war of invasion against France, if Russia were victorious, and the Holy Alliance, minus England, recon- stituted; or a war of invasion against us, if the Western allies were successful. I never could believe in any of the attempts made by England and France to persuade the public and themselves that they would stop short of the uttermost; that they would go thus far and no farther. In the first place, war such as this once begun, there is no possibility for the victorious party to place a limit to his enterprise, if the vanquished one obstinately abstains from crying, ' Hold, enough ' A continuance of the war to the extremest verge of international destruction is probably the very fatality of the war, and cannot be prevented; and," my interlocutor added, "I will tell you who firmly believed the struggle would be carried up to the walls of St. Peters- burg-the late Czar Nicholas. He never believed war would breakout at all, and was on that point utterly-blind for a very long while; but when it did in teal earnest break out, he clearly saw its consequences, or, I should rather say, he admitted there were none that it might not lead to." I asked this gentleman if he did not look forward with dismay to the chances of ruin to his country, if he built upon a possi- bility of resistance. At this he smiled and shook his head, and his reply was, "Oh, you short-sighted and from-day-to-day-living people of France and England, how completely impossible it does appear that' you should ever arrive at anything like an accurate knowledge of the Russian character No, to say the truth, I do not build upon any efficacy of resistance; that is, upon any resistance that shall drive out  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7492-00000136"/> 258           CHT-CHAT. of Russia the invading forces, as in 1812. I do not calculate upon this, and I am inclined to fancy that my appreciation of this point is also that of the intelligent majority of my countrymen; but suppose Cron- stadt falls, and 1Moscow, is taken, and St. Petersburg follows; what then f 50 years afterwards the whole will be as though it had never been. Here is the superiority of Russia, and the characteristic you never can comprehend; we do not bargain with time as you do. You count by two, or three, or ten years; we count by fifty, seventy, a hundred years, if required; you think of yourselves--of what you in your own persons will lose or gain or profit by, or enjoy; a generation is to you something very great, whilst to us it is nothing. There is our force. We calculate really on the infinite future, and have always done so. I may not, indeed, pretty certainly shall not, live to see Russia survive from the blow which will probably be dealt her within the next year or two; but that does not make me at all uneasy about her future. I am sorry Providence should have made me live just at. the moment when my country is in misfortune, but I cannot possibly have a doubt of her destinies. Besides, when you have taken Moscow and St. Petersburg, what will you doJ I defy you or any nation upon the world's surface, to occupy Russia-to turn Russia to any account whatsoever. For the moment, conquer us as much as you please, you cannot destroy us, and you cannot prevent us from outliving all our disasters. Russians only can govern or people Russia., we are one of the world's necessities and we shall endure." All this was said with- out any bitterness or pique-without any exultation-but with quiet, cool, deliberate conviction. Another remark made was this:--"Be sure of this, that there are but three countries in the world-Russia, England,-and France. All the rest are as nothing; they do not exist; and," he added, ' I can tell you, with perfect accuracy, that upon this point your Lord Palmerston thinks exactly as I do, and so does Louis Napoleon, though, of the two, Lord Palmerston is the more entirely convinced of it; and, above all, he has been so for a much longer space of time.'? 4LOVE.

TH "Black Art 1"Black- it was indeed, in those worst of days, for they were full of folly, ignorance, cruelty, and superstition, which we misname the A" good old times." In the good old times the magician was looked upon as a being in direct connexion and alliance with the Evil one. The more learned was he, the more certain was he of per- ,dition. The scientific researches of such men as Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, and Cornelius Agrippa, were regarded only as so many diabolical spells and infernal enchantments. The imagination pictured to itself -the magician as a gloomy, long-bearded man in a robe, embroidered with grim cabalistic characters. A staff encircled by serpents was in his hand, spectacles of magic crystal perched on his nose. He sat on a tripod in the centre of a circle of zodiacal signs -traced in blood. He studied out of books of weird and mysterious lore. Skulls, phials of poisons, dried toads and snakes, were on his table; hideous stuffed monsters hung from the ceiling. He was waited upon by a demon dwarf. Shrieks and groans were heard from his dwelling; hideous bats and gigantic spiders flitted about him. He passed all this time weaving maleficent spells, sticking corking-pins into wax figures of persons he wished to injure; distilling love-philters watching the simmering of magic cauldrons, and changing men into beasts and beasts into men. He attended witches' sabbaths, whisking through the air on a broomstick; he appeared unbidden- at banquets; he dropped through roofs and rose through floors; and, some day or other, a gentleman in black, and on a black horse with a long tail, left his card on him, and there was a Strong smell of sulphur -palpable, and the magician was seen no more. - The Black Art I Tempora mutantur: times have vastly changed since then. The professor of the black art now wears a white waistcoat, pays rates and taxes, has a wife and family; and, instead of mystic adjurations of " hocus pocus" and " abracadabra" and "mumbo jumbo," issues invitations for his friends to come and see him at a theatre or an assembly-room. And yet, believe me, the magi- cian's art has in no way deteriorated. The marvels of magic are as feasible now as they were in the days of the Dioseuri and the magicians of King Pharaoh. Nay, more; we can do even more wonderful things nowadays, only 'we are not bold or impious enough to ascribe them to supernatural agency. We are content to hail, shining on our magic works, the pure light of science, chemistry, and natural philosophy.   OHT-OHAT.             261 THE VANIsmaNG PuzzLE.--This famous and historical feat (it has been practised in all ages, and in every country under the sun), and perhaps more familiarly known as the "Doll Trick," is thus performed. You must be provided with the figure of a man made of wood, about the size of a small Dutch doll, the head of which takes off and on by means of a peg in the body which fits into an aperture in the neck. You must also have a cloth cap with a bag within for the purpose of concealing the head; but this must be very neatly constructed, in order that it may not be readily perceived. Now show your little man to the assembled company, saying, "Gentle- men, I call this my bonus genius." Then show  / the cap, saying, "This, gentlemen, is his coat." Add, "lNow look on steadily at him as ever you can, yet, nevertheless, I will deceive you." Then  hold the cap  above your face, and take the , little man in your right hand, and put his head l through the hole of the cap, as represented in the! I   engraving. Proceed to describe the doll's virtues  =   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7492-00000138"/> 262          HRIT-OHAT, as eloquently as you like, saying, "Now he's a great traveller. He is ready to go any message I like to send him on-to France, to Spain, to Constantinople, to the Crimea, or to the North or South Pole, wherever and whichever you like; but he must have some money to pay his ex- penses." 'Tien pull out your right hand from under the cap, and with it the body of the doll privately, plit your right hand into your pocket (as if you were feeling for money), and leave the body there. Then take your hand out Of your pocket and say, "There is a shilling for you, and now be off on your travels, Sir." Then turn the head and say," But he must look about him before he goes;" then say (setting your forefinger upon his head), "Just as I thrust my finger down he shall vanish ;" and immediately with the assistance of your left hand that is under the cap convey his head into the little bag that is within the cap, then turn the cap about, and, knocking it on the palm of your hand, say, "See, he is gone!"Take your cap and hold it up again, drawing the head out of the little bag, and say, "Hei Genius mei velocissimus, ubi," and give a whistle, at the same time thrust the head up through the hole in the cap, and hold the head by the peg, and turn ,it about, You can thus cause the doll to appear and disappear as many times as you like, to the great amaze- ment and bewilderment of the company. -THE PRESTIDIGITORIAL METAMORPHOSIS; OR CARDS WHCH BECOME ANTrHNG.-Having shuffled the pack, select the eight of each suit, and also the deuce of diamonds. Hold the four eights in the left hand, and the deuce in the right; then, having shown them to the company, take in the deuce among the four eights in the left hand, and throw out one of the eights. Give them to be blown upon, they will be turned into four deuces. You will now exchange- one of the deuces for the eight; and, giving them again to be blown upon, they will appear all black cards Again, take in the deuce and discard the ace; blow upon them again, andthey will all turn red. And now, for the last time, take in the eight and throw away a deuce, when they will be found to be four eights and a deuce, as they were at first. To perform this ingenious deception, you procure five plain cards the size of playing-cards, which you paint to resemble the five cards as under :- 1     Q        46                 f , ^    OHT-O H A T.          263 Mixing them with a common pack, you next, under the pretext of selecting the eight of each suit and the deuce of diamonds, take out your false cards (Nos 1, 2, 3, 4), which you hold as under; and, taking No. 5 in your right hand, you show your company ,that there are four eights and the  / deuce of diamonds; you should also hold  tx*   /  XiD  them up to the light to let t em see the at /     X they are not double, which you may do     \ ' without fear of detection, as the lower-parts    t  of the cards will be so opaque that the defi- /l A X . ciency of the pips or spots will not'be per. ceptible. You now place the deuce of dia-  monds between Nos. 3 and 4, the latter of which you withdraw and throw   on the table (but take care not to do so until you  . B have first taken in No. 6) the deuce of dia-  '7 monds), else the deficiency of spots on No. 3 will cause the trick to be dis- covered; you then close those four cards together, and taking them by the top with the fingers and thumb of the right hand, having the thumb on the face of the cards and the fingers on the back, hold them out, their faces turned towards the floor, and desire some person to blow upon them When this has been done give your wrist a turn, so that the top part of the cards will now be the bottoms-in fact, you turn the cards up- side down; hold them up to your mouth, pretending to breathe upon them, which not only tends to mystify the company, but gives you time to arrange your cards, which you do by opening them out of the right hand, when they will appear to be four deuces in the order represented in the following figure. You may again hold them up to the light to show they are single cards.\              /  The next change, though  more difficult  \  to accomplish, is decidedly the best, for the cards are never shut up nor removed for a  moment from sight. Having shown them to be four deuces, you take in the deuce of clubs and place it between Nos. 8 and 5, withdraw No. 6, and, holding it up to the light, you desire the company to observe that the cards are not double, and, while all  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7492-00000139"/> 264          CHT-OHAT. eyes are turned to this card, turn your left hand containing the other four with its back towards the ceiling and the face of the cards towards the door, keeping them  in a horizontal position; throw down the deuce of diamonds, and continue your remarks on the cards not being double-by saying, "You perceive any of them will bear examination;" at the same time take care of the card next but one to your right hand with the finger and thumb of that hand, taking care to have the thumb above and the fingers under- neath the card. Take it out, still keeping it in a horizontal position; and while making the above observation turn it round with the fore- finger of the right hand, until you have got hold of the other end, when, before anybody has taken time to take hold of it, return it to the situation from which you took it, taking care to return it exactly to the same angle. You now hold these cards out, with the backs upward, to be blown upon. But you have no occasion'to shut them up at this change, as, if you turn them over, it will be perceived that they are all black. You now take the deuce of diamonds, as you did at the first change, and discard the eight of clubs; close them up, and, taking them by the top, hold them out to be blown upon; give your wrist a turn as before, open them out yourself while pretending to breathe upon them, when on showing them to the company, they will all be red. You now again take in the eight of clubs, throwing out the deuce of diamonds on the table with- its face downwards, and, taking hold of the card next but one to your right hand, throw it down in the same manner, saying, "Oh, I beg pardon, only one of the deuces!"' at the same time take up the last card you threw out by the opposite end to that by which you formerly held it, and return it to its own place, talking particular care of the angle; let them be blown upon, when they will be found to be four eights and a deuce, as they were in the first instance. Should any person now desire to examine the cards, tell them you can only give them one at a time; breathe upon the deuce of diamonds and present it to them. When they have returned it to you, and before they have time to ask for another, hand them the eight of clubs, mention- ing that perhaps they would like to look at a black card ; and, seeing you so confident, it is not in the chapter of probabilities that they will ask to examine any more. THE JAGIa OF TERPSICHORE; OP, HOW TO TEACH AN EGG TO DANCE.--   HT-O HA T.             265 Three eggs are brought out, and two of them are put on the table and the third in a hat; a little cane is borrowed from one of the company, and it is shown about, to convince the spectators that there has been no preparation. It is then placed across the hat, the hat falls to the ground, and the egg sticks to it as though it were glued. Then ask some one to play on the pianoforte, and the egg, as though sensible of the harmony, twists about the cane from one end to the other, and continues its gyrations till the music stops. The egg is fastened to a thread by a pin, which is put in lengthways; and the hole which has been made to introduce the pin is stopped with white wax. The other end of the thread is fastened to the breast of the person who performs the trick, with a pin bent like a hook; the thread passing under the cane near the egg serves for it to rest upon. When the music begins the performer pushes the cane from right to left, and from left to right. It then appears as if the egg ran along the cane, which it does not: being fastened to the thread, its centre of gravity remains always at the same distance from the hook that holds it; it is the cane which, sliding along, presents its different points to the surface of the egg. To pro- duce the illusion, and persuade the company that it is the egg that moves, the performer should turn a little on his heel. By this means the egg receives a deceptive motion. i THm  A EmmCTONATE CARD.-This trick, if properly managed, will appear marvellous. Having forced a  card upon one of the company, after shuffling it up with one of the-pack, you will know the card by feeling. You then take a small piece of wax and place it under the thumb-nail of your right hand, and by this wax you fasten one end of a hair to your thumb, and the other to the chosen card By these means, when you spread your cards on the table, by drawing about your right hand, the chosen card will follow you all round the table, as though attracted by some magic sympathy. THE PENmATIVz SHMLrNG.-TO perform this trick you must have a handkerchief with a counter the same size as the shilling, sewed up in one corner of it; take your handkerchief out of your pocket, and ask come person in company to lend you a  shilling, which you must seem carefully to wrap up in the handkerchief, but at the same time keep the shilling in the palm of your hand, and in its stead wrap the corner in which the counter is sewed into the middle of the handkerchief, and 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7492-00000140"/> 266           CHT-OHAT. bid the person who lent you the shilling feel that his money is there. Lay the handkerchief under a hat upon the table, take a glass or tea- cup in the hand that holds the shilling, place it under the shilling, under which knock three times, saying "4 Presto! come quicklyl"Then let the shilling drop from your hand into the glass. Take the hand- kerchief by the corner that holds the counter and shake it, and the shilling not being there it will appear to have passed through the table into the glass or teacup. THE MAGICAL WEDDING RING.--This is a feat somewhat akin to the preceding, but far more marvellous in its seeming effects. The trick is, pass a ring from a handkerchief in which it is firmly held on to a cane, the same cane being firmly held at either end. The following is the manner in which the trick is performed.-You must provide yourself with two rings, exactly similar. One ring is suspended by a string, the other end of which is fastened inside the handkerchief. You feign to place the .ring which is to appear on the ieane into the handkerchief, and desire a person to. feel that -the ring is really there, he feeling, of course, the suspended ring. You then desire two persons to hold the cane, slipping the ring adroitly over one end of it to the middle, where you keep it clasped in your hand. You desire the two persons holding the cane to hold it as tightly as ever they can. You then hold the handkerchief over the plate, and allow the suspended ring to drop on it, the sound of its fall being distinctly audible. You then remove your grasp from the cane and flourish' the handkerchief; there is nothing in the plate and apparently nothing in the handkerchief, and lo and behold the ring is found on the cane, to the utter amazement of the persons who have been holding it so tightly. THE most original spelling we have ever seen is the following. It beats phonetics: 80 you be-a tub. 80 oh! pea-a -top. Be 80-bat. See 80-cat. Pea 80-pat. Are 80. -rat. See oh I double you-cow See you be-cub. See a bee-Cab. Be you double tea-butt. Be a double ell-2ball Iufoination not to be Sneezed at.-If you wish to avoid sneezing, or stop a fit of that unpleasant act, press the finger on the upper lip, just under the nostrils, and the power to indulge in that nasal frailty is nipped in the bud.   aHrT-CHAT.             267 THE PRICE OF BATMLE AT the battle of Arcola the Austrians lost, in killed and wounded, 18,000 men; the French, 16,000.

RELATIVE POWER OF ENGLAND AND RUSSA A CORRESPONDENT of the London Times furnishes the following singular calculation:- As any contribution towards a correct estimate of the relative powers of the contending parties may not be without some interest, I venture to communicate the following simple deductions from recent statistics for the middle of the year 1855 :-- 1. Population of Great Britain in round numbers . . 28,000,000 Population of Russia ........... 62,000,000 That is the respective populations, speaking roughly, are as 15 to 7 men in favor of Russia. 2. Persons to one geographical square mile:- Great Britain ..                   310 Russia                      ..  89 Or in other words, the densities of population are respectively as 31 to 9 nearly in favor of Great Britain. 3. Number of towns over 50,000 inhabitants:- Great Britain . .  ............... 32 Russia .  ................              8 That is, the numbers of great towns in both countries are as 32 to 8 in favor of England. 'And finally- 4.

BITS OF BACON. FEW works in the range of philosophy possess so many claims to an attentive study as the writings of Lord Bacon: these are, however, too recondite and voluminous for the every-day reader, and we have taken a few of the most prominent thoughts of his essays as an agreeable exer- cise for the mind, TUTzu "What is Truth?" said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer. (It has surprised P. P. that Bacon has missed here the opportunity of pointing out the fact that Pilate addressed the question to the only being who could answer the question satisfactorily.) "Truth," continues Bacon, "may come to the price of a pearl that fheweth best by day, but it will not rise to the price of a diamond or carbuncle that sheweth best in varied lights. A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure. Doth any man doubt that if there were taken out of men's minds, vain opinions, flattering hopes, false valuations, imongin-  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7492-00000142"/> 270           CHT-OHAT ations as one would, and the like, but it would leave the minds of a number of men poor shrunken things full of melancholy and indisposi- tion, and unpleasing to themselves. Clear and round dealing is the honor of men's nature. There is no vice that doth so cover a mati with shame as to be found false and per- fidious. Lying is being brave towards God, and a coward towards men. DEATH. Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark. Cer- tainly the contemplation of death as the wages of sin and passage to another world is holy and religious, but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto nature, is weak.              - It is worthy the observing that there is no passion in the mind of man 80 weak, but it mates and masters the fear of death. Revenge triumphs over death; love slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief fleeth to it; fear preoccupieth it; and pity sometimes provoketh many to die out of mere love for some dear friend. Seneca says that satiety often tends to suicide. It is as natural to die as to be born, and to a little infant perhaps the one is as painful as the other. REVENGE. Revenge is a kind of wild justice, which the more a man's nature runneth to, the more ought law to weed it out, for as for the first wrong it doth but offend the law, but the revenge of that wrong putteth the law out of office. Certainly in taking revenge a man is but even with his enemy, but in passing it over he is superior. There is no man doth a wrong for the wrong's sake, but thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or honor, or the like: therefore why should I be angry with a man for loving himself better than me. The most tolerable sort of revenge is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy. This is certain, that a man who studieth revenge keeps his wounds green, which otherwise would heal and do well. DISSIMULATION. Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy or wisdom, for it asketh a strong wit and a strong heart to know when to tell truth, and to do it: therefore it is the weaker sort of politicians that are the great dissemblers. Certainly the ablest men that ever were, have had an openness and frankness of dealing, and a name of certainty and veracity. There be three degrees of this hiding and veil- ing of a man's self: the first, closeness, reservation, and secrecy when a   CHT-OHAT.             271 man leaveth himself without observation, or hold to be taken, what he is: the second, dissimulation in the negative, when a man lets fall signs and arguments that he is not that he is: and the third, simulation in the affirmative, when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pre- tends to be what he is not. These carry their disadvantages; the first shows fearfulness; the second perplexes his coadjutors, and makes a man walk almost alone to his own ends; the third that it deprives a man of the principal instruments of action, that is, trust and belief MARRTAGE AD SINGLE LFE. He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune. Unmarried men are best friends, best masters best servants, but not always best subjects. Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity; and single men are good to make severe inquisitors, because their tenderness is not so oft called upon. Chaste women are often proud and froward, as though presuming upon their virtue. Wives are young men's mistresses-. companions for middle age, and old men's nurses. ENVY. A man that hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others, for men's minds will either feed upon their own good, or upon others' evil, and who wanteth the one will prey upon the other; and whoso is out of hope to attain to another's virtue, will seek to come at even hand by depressing another's fortune. A man that is busy and inquisitive is commonly envious. Deformed persons are commonly envious, for he that cannot possibly mend his own case, will do what he can to impair another's. LovE. This passion hath its floods in the very times of weakness, which are, great prosperity, and great adversity, though this latter hath been less observed, both which times kindle love, and make it more fervent, and therefore, show it to be the child of folly. I know not how, but martial men are given to Jove; I think it is, but as they are given to wine; for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasure. Nuptial love maketh mankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it. ATHEISM. I had rather believe all the fables in the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than that this universal frame is without a mind., And there- fore God never wrought miracles to convince Atheism, because his  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7492-00000143"/> 272           C H IT- H AT. ordinary works convince it. It is true that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to Atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.  SUPERSTITION. It were better to have no opinion of God at all than such an opinion as is unworthy of him, for the one is merely unbelief, the other contumely, arid certainly Superstition' is the reproach of the Deity. Plutarch saith well to that purpose. "Surely," saith he, "I had rather a great deal men should say, there was no such man at all as Plutarch, than that they should say, that there was one Plutarch who eat his children as soon as they were born, as the poets speak of Saturn. Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an out- ward moral virtue, though religion were not, but superstition dis- mounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the minds of men, CUNNING. Cunning is a sinister or crooked wisdom. I know one that, when he wrote a letter, he would put that which was most material in the postscript, as if it had been a bye manner. SUSPICION. Suspicions amongst thoughts are like bats amongst birds, that ever fly by twilight. They are defects, not in the heart, but the brain. In a fearful nature they gain ground very fast. ANGER. TO know how absurd a thing anger is, let a man reflect the day after on the occurrence that made him so, and he will straightway condemn his own impulse. ADVERSITr. The virtue of prosperity is temperance; the virtue of adversity is fortitude; which in mortals is the most heroical virtue. Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes; and adversity is  not without comforts and hopes. Certainly virtue is like precious odours, most fragrant when they are crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue.

A GENTLEMAN, a few evenings since, while taking a swim in the lake at Buffalo, N.

'Pursuit was in vain, and the denuded one was compelled to make up the deficiencies of his wardrobe with blasphemy I In fact, in the language of scripture, " he clothed himself with curses as with a garment."

A simple-minded Hibernian, who had just ar- rived in New York from Tipperary, going into one of the restaurants, called for dinner; when the waiter had brought it, he as usual laid down the metal counter. Paddy astonished, said to himself:- "Be jabers, this is the land for me; when a man asks for some din- ner, they give him a bit of money to buy a sup of whiskey into the bargain." When he had swallowed his meal, the delighted Paddy was leaving, when he was stopped by the waiter, with, "Hallo I where's your money-are you going without paying!" Paddy stopped, and taking the metal counter from his pocket, said, "Boderation take ye all, ye spalpeens, why would ye be after giving me the bit of money at all at all, if ye meant to take it away again ' Take your dirty money I  Perhaps ye'll be after wishing me to return my dinner to ye again " So saying,-he threw the metal ticket down on the counter, and march- ed off in a state of virtuous indignation.  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7492-00000144"/> 274          cOHT-CHAT.

Agnes SoreL--An anecdote has been transmitted to us, which illus- trates her playful yet judicious interference in the military measures of Charles the Seventh. An astrologer, in whose predictions the monarch placed much reliance, was closeted with him on one occasion when Agnes was present. Charles, discouraged by some recent failures, and the predictions of the soothsayer; was more than ordinarily disheart- ened, and disposed to inaction-Agnes interrupted the conference by extending her hand to the magician: "I also would read my destiny," she said. "Madam, you will be beloved by the greatest monarch in Europe," readily replied the flattering astrologer, well aware of her re- lation to the King. Charles smiled at the implied compliment to him- self; but Agnes rose, and playfully addressed him--"Will your Majesty grant me your royal safe-conduct, for I would not willingly run counter to my destiny," she said, archly. "I must go to the King of England, for I see clearly he is the greatest monarch, since he retains, in addition to his own dominions, the richest provinces of France, from which its sovereign makes no effort to dislodge him, fearing, it would seem, to assert his legitimate claim." Charles blushed under the merited, though sportive rebuke. Such a persuasive Mentor seldom spoke in vain: but her influence was most practically felt by bringing, as with extraordi- nary sagacity she did, under the notice of the King, brave knights and skilful warriors, whose courage and prudence achieved many a victory for the national cause.   -OHT-OHAT.       .     275 SHAOPERTAN WOMEN. IN nothing does the genius of Shakspere appear more marvellous than in his delineations of the female character. We can understand that a man of observation and reflection may be able, by diving into his own nature, and by constant association with his fellow men, to depict with tolerable accuracy various descriptions of his own sex; but only that wonderful intuition which so remarkably distinguishes the poet of Ham- let, of all others, could have enabled him to call into almost actual being such creations as Ophelia, Desdemona, Isabella, and his other female characters. Woman, that strange enigma, seems to throw aside her mystery, and reveal her subtle motives to the high priest of the Human Heart. Lamb had such a reverence for these children of Shak- spere's brain, that he told Hazlitt one day, that he intended to marry when he could find one of "Shakspere's women!" Mrs. Cowden Clarke has, in her very graceful work, the Girlhood of Shakspere's Heroines, amplified the great poet's plan, and endeavored to elaborate their existence. DESDEMONA.-We have always been of opinion that this lady has been vastly overrated, for it seems that both as a daughter and a wife, she brought disaster upon her father and her husband. Her father says, very significantly, "Look to her, Moor, She has deeived her father, and may thee 1" At the very best, she can only be considered as a very weak woman; indeed, we almost feel inclined to add, half-witted. Witness the injudi- cious pressing of Cassio's suit with her husband, when she saw it annoy- ed him, and her want of candor respecting the handkerchief. That she was not a woman of any refinement, is evidenced by her overlooking the difference of color in Othello, who, although not so black, perhaps, as a " nigger," must have carried enough soot upon his countenance to have disgusted any well regulated damsel. Her want of veracity is shown even in her dying hour by her asserting that she killed herself; and however we may allow it to. escape our utter condemnation by placing it to the account of conjugal self-devotion, it shows that disre- gard of Truth, which is the grand defect in her character. Trusting that none of our American ladies will fall in love, or make runaway' matches with niggers, although they sing as well as George Christy, we take our leave of Mrs. Othello.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7492-00000145"/> 276           C- II T-O c HA T. PORTIA.-We confess to a great respect for this strong-minded wo- man, but should prefer her for our counsellor-at law than love. Indeed, for a wife, she knows too much law to plehe us We should always be suspecting she was accumulating evidence to hang or divorce us, and consider- our tenderest conversations as so many depositions filed upon oath. Nevertheless, if a man were to get into a scrape, she would be an excellent wife to help her husband out, provided she had the dispo- sition. One of her peculiarities, is her intense' fondness for similes, of which she is a complete mistress. Her mind is essentially logical, and in a nation of Amrnazons, she would undoubtedly have made an excellent Attorney General. It is remarkable that the daughters of Shakspere with whom we are most acquainted, Desdemona, Juliet, Jessica, Hero, Miranda, Rosalind, Celia, and Portia, have neither brother nor sister. Each of them is the only child of her parents. Ophelia has no sister. With the exception of Juliet, they are all motherless. Although Lady Capulet talks of her old age, being warned to a sepulchre, she was but twenty-eight when- she proposed to her daughter the acceptance of Paris' hand. There is no confiding love nor affectionate intercourse between Juliet and her mother. 'On the contrary, she is reserved and secret, keeping her stranger to her thoughts. Lady Macheth stands distinctly apart from the other females of Shakspere, knowing no kin, as if authoress of her- self, yet she is restrained by reverential awe, when, intent on evil, she casts her eyes upon the image of her sleeping father. Jessica is insen- sible to any such touch of natural tenderness. The daughters of Lear, with their deformity, scarcely surpass her in cruelty and filial impiety. She betrays her father, plunders his house, bears off his family remem- brances; elopes with his enemies and the enemies of her race. Even the ring of Leah, on which she knew his old age doted, she profanely exchanges for a monkey, and, in the end, consorts and feasts amidst ex- ultations over his overthrow and ruin. Desdemona is an unkind daugh- ter. She deceives, and clandestinely, in the night, deserts her- father's house for the " sooty bosom of a Moor." The match was mortal to him, grief -of it broke his heart. In all her subsequent career, in sunshine and storm, and even in the last memorable evening in her bed-chamber, alone with Emilia, when her thoughts recur to her childhood and the memories of her mother and her mother's maid Barbara rise up before 'her, she has not a tear, nor word of pity or tenderness, or even a thought for her. neglected and languishing father.

THE MEIST WIFS BFTFTROT G. AN IRISH LEGEND. It is a popular superstition in Ireland, that if a parent, knowingly, omits blessing a child when it sneezes, the unlucky object is sure to die. JUDITH died in middle life; So Michael took another wife; For without a mother true, What could his poor children do? Two sweet boys were left alive, They'were aged twelve and five. Phelim was the first born son: Patrick was the younger one. Phelim was a gentle chile, Like his mother, fair and mild, But, poor boy, he was not strong, So he could not labor long. He would often sadly stray, To some forest far away, And beneath its shadow lie With the dark tears in his eye; Since he could not earn his bread. No harsh word his father said; For he loved his darlings two, As much as Father's heart could do. So he often cheered the lad, When he saw him pale and sad: Saying with a pleasant smile (Though his spirit bled the whilex Y You will soon grow strong and bold, And work for me when I am old." But, alas I he pined away, Hour by hour, and day by day. IL Michael's wealth was very small; One good cow, and that was all, But it fed, and clothed the four, Grazing near the cottage door:   CHT-CH   AT.             279 To poor Michael's deep dismay, The cow fell sick one autumn day; And the winter time at hand, Would not let him till the land. If their sole support should die, What but death, or beggary? To a gipsy Michael bent His footsteps, groaning as he went. She replied with mystic breath, "Naught can save, the cow from death, Save one charm, which you must swear;-- To obey with studious care." Michael, then, though very loath, Swore in solemn words the oath. Then the haggard gipsy said, Bowing thrice her matted head: 4"You will hear this very night, Your boy Phelim sneeze outright: You must check the wish to speak The blessing, or the spell will break l Then the cow will surely die, And ruin seize your family." With a soul o'erwhelmed with pain, Michael sought his home again. To his wife he told the tale, "God," she said, " will never faill" As around the evening meal They were sitting, sad tears steal Down his face, for his poor child With a pallid sickness smiled, And then sneezed with hollow sound; Michael groaned, and looked around, But the usual blessing died On his lips, now horror-tied, For he thought of his dear wife, And his little Patrick's life   &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7492-00000147"/> 280            CHT-HIAT. And he'felt, that if be said A blessing, they were surely dead. ' Again, poor Phelim sneezed--no word f'   Was in Michael's cottage heard. While an anguish seemed to brood, Like a mist upon a wood. But, when again he sneezed, his wife Blessed the boy, and saved his life. As these kindly words she said, Lo I the spirit of the dead, Judith's shadow from the tomb, Slowly glided through the room. And in tones, as clear as life, Blessed by name the second wife. Blessed her in her cottage home; Blessed her in the world to come. Blessed her in the moonlight fair, Blessed her in the sun's bright air. From that hour the boy became Bold and vigorous in his frame-; And the cow was ill no more, But gave twice her usual store; And on that solemn eve, ieach year, Did the sainted dead appear-- Passing sweetly through that room, In a shape half light-half gloom-- Blessing all who sat around, In her sweet familiar sound. "FUSION."--Under this head, Ohio papers now place marriage notices. We clip the following from the Chillicothe Gfazette:-- FUSED.-Mr. R. Van Slyck with Miss Abbey Scott, all of this town.

"I know that what you say is true," replied the repentant belle, "but what shall I do to reduce our expenses?" "Why, ma chore," replied the husband, delighted with her submis- sion, "you ride a great deal, why not take an omnibus occasionally, instead of a carriage I that would save something." The wife agreed, and when her husband was gone, she rang for her maid. "Marietta, call me a coach, that I may get to the omnibus to go to the Madeleine. I am going to economize." CARLYE says: "When I gaze into the stars, they look down upon me with pity from their serene and silent spaces, like eyes glistening with tears over-the little lot of men.

Not to perpetuate a name, Which must endure while the peaceful arts flourish, But to show That mankind have learned to know those Who best deserve their gratitude, The King, His ministerS, and many of the nobles And commoners of the realm Raised this monument to James Watt, Who, directing the force of an original genius, Early exercised in philosophic research, To the improvement of the Steam Engine, Enlarged the resources of his country, Increased the power of man, And rose to eminent place Among the most illustrious followers of science, And the real benefactors of the world. There is something very significant in the " label" on the great Earl of Chatham. There is nothing said of the people of England in it. Erected by the King and Parliament, As a testimony to The Virtues and Ability of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, During whose administration, in the reigns of George II. and George IIL., Divine Providence Exalted Great Britain To a height of Prosperity and Glory Unknown in any former age.

Jonson is celebrated for his epitaphs upon two high-born ladies, but they partake, we think, of more conceit than poetry Underneath this stone doth lie As much virtue as could die; Which, when alive, did vigor give To as much beauty as could live. If she had a single fault, Leave it buried in this vault. Underneath this sable hearse Lies the subject of all verse, Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother, Death, ere thou hast slain another, Fair, and wise, and good as she, Time shall throw his dart at thee. From this let us turn to Pope's lament over Gay the Poet. Of manners gentle, and affections mild; In wit a man, simplicity a ch/ld. Pope, however, had no real tenderness in his nature; even his dirge over his particular friend, Craggs, is a mere labored piece of versifica- tion. Statesman, yet friend to truth t of soul sincere, In action faithful, yet in honor clear  ;Who broke no promise, served no private end, Who g lined no title, and who lost no friend; Ennobled by Himself, by all approved, Praised, wept, and honored by the Muse he loved. There is some fun in this. Here lies the body of Sarah Sexton, Who as a wife has never vext one; We can't say that for her at the next stone. But perhaps incongruous images were never forced together-more absurdly than in that of Sir Robert Boyle, whose monumental inserip- tion is- SACRED TO TEM MEMORY OF ROBERT BOYE, THE FATHER OF S0IORmE AND BROTHER TO THE ]CABL OF COB.

EPITAPH ON HOGARTHs Farewell, great painter of mankind, Who reached the noblest point of art; Whose pictured morals charm the mind, And through the eye correct the heart I If genius fire thee, reader, stay; If nature touch thee, drop a tear :- If neither move thee, turn away, For Hogarth's honored dust lies here. ONE ON SIR JOHN VANBRTUGH THE ARBOHTECT. Lie heavy on him, Earth, for he Laid many a heavy load on thee. Having said all this about epitaphs, let us add a few lines as to where we wish to be buried :--"Give us, whenever the appointed hour arrives, no other monument than a parterre, six feet by two, not hung about with trumpery dyed wreaths of eternelles and fragile amaranths, but planted with humble, homely, low-growing favorites-the aconite and the snowdrop, to mark a resurrection from the dead of winter; the violet and the lily of the valley, to join cheerfully in the sweetness of spring; the rose, to sympathize with the beauty of summer; and the Japan anemone and the chrysanthemum, to carry a smile into the fading light of autumn. So best may the corruptible body be rendered up to Nature." A Punster on Puns.-Sydney Smith discourses thus on puns:- "They are, I believe, what I have denominated them-the wit of words. They are exactly the same to words as wit is to ideas, and consist in the sudden discovery of relations in language. A pun, to be perfect in its kind, should contain two distinct meanings; the one common and obvious, the other more remote; and in the notice which the mind takes of the relation between these two sets of words, and in the sur- prise which that relation excites, the pleasure of a- pun consists. Miss Hamiltor, in a book on education, mentions the case of a boy so very neglectful that he could never be brought to read the word patriarchs;  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7492-00000151"/> 288           CH T- O HAT. but whenever he met with it, he always pronounced it partridges. A friend of the writer observed to her, that it could hardly be considered as a mere piece of negligence, for it appeared to him that the boy, in calling them partridges, was making game of the patriarchs. Now, here are two distinct meanings contained in the same phrase: for to make game of the patriarchs is to laugh at them; or to make game of them is, by a very extravagant and laughable sort of ignorance of words, to rank them among pheasants, partridges, and other such delicacies, which the law takes under its protection and calls game; and the whole pleasure derived from this pun consists in the discovery that two such meanings are referable to one form of expression." Milton-,Symmons, in his Life of Milton, says that Napoleon Bona- parte declared to Sir Colin Campbell, who had charge of his person on the Isle of Elba, that he was a great admirer of Milton's "Paradise Lost," and that he had read it to some purpose, for that the plan of the battle of Austerlitz he borrowed from the sixth book of that work, where Satan brings his artillery to bear upon Michael and his angelic host with such direful effeet- "Training his devilish enginery, impaled On every side with shadowing squadrons deep, To hdme ft"cq.' This new mode of warfare appeared to Bonaparte so likely to succeed, if applied in actual use, that he determined upon its adoption, and succeeded beyond expectation. A reference to the details of that battle will be found to assimilate so completely with Milton's imaginary fight, as to leave no doubt of the assertion. When Paradise Lost was published, the celebrated Waller wrote this passage:--"The old blind schoolmaster, John Milton, hath published a tedious poem on the fall of man; if its length be not considered as merit, it hath no other." The Avarcious Man.--Four more truthful lines than the follow- ing, are rarely written. The figure which "it", involves is eminently suggestive: ,That man may breathe, but never lives, Who much receives, but never gives; "Whom none can love, whom none can thanl, Creation's blot, Creation's blank."   -OHZITOHAT.               2189 Oux idea is, says a fellow that got a shrew for a wif^ that.- "Woman's love is like Scotch snuff, We get one pinch and that's enough."

"My dear," said an affectionate spouse to her husband, " am I not your only treasure?" "Yes," was the cool reply, "and I would will- ingly lay it up in heaven."

Clure for a "Dreadful Cold." --How often it is that a young lady, when pressed for a song, is afflicted with a sudden cold. The best cure for this is to ask her sister to sing. AN English tombstone bears the following inscription:- "Sacred to the remains of Jonathan Thompson, a pious Christian and an affectionate husband. His disconsolate widow still continues to carry on the tripe and trotter business at the same place as before her bereavement." The Doctor'l Welcome.-Down east there resides a certain M. D. One very cold night he was aroused from his slumbers by a very loud knocking at his door. After some hesitation, he went to the window and asked- "Who's there?" "Friend," was the answer. "What do you want?" "Want to stay here all night." 'Stay there, then," was the benevolent reply How does it happen that the most superficial orators generally make the longest speeches? The answer to this question (which is not a co- nundrum) appears to be, that those gentlemen endeavor to give their orations in length that which they want in depth. Truth.-To have no concern for the truth, to be false and fallacious, is a character which no person who is not utterly abandoned, would choose to bear; it is a character from which we expect nothing but levity and inconsistency. Truth seems to be considered by all mankind as something fixed, unchangeable, and eternal.

AT the breaking up of a dinner party, two of the company fell down stairs; the one tumbled on the first landing, the other rolled to the bot- tom. It was observed that the first was dead drunk. "Yes, but he is not so far gone as the gentleman below," answered a wag. A paper asks very innocently, if it is any harm for young ladies to sit in the lapse of ages. Another replies that it all depends on the kind of ages selected. Those from eighteen to twenty-five, it puts down as extra hazardous. DOEsTcxs has indented a patent medicine, which he calls the "Four Horse Power Balsam," and the following is one of the many certificates which he has received, setting forth its merits:--"I had the pleasure of participating in a gunpowder explosion, on which occasion my arms and legs were scattered over the village, and my mangled remains pretty equally distributed throughout the entire country. Under these circum- stances my life was despaired of, and my classmates had bought a pine coffin and borrowed whole shirts to attend the funeral in; when the invincible power of your Four Horse Power Balsam, which I happened to have in my vest pocket, suddenly brought together the scattered parts. of my body, collected my limbs from the rural districts, put new life into my shattered frame, and I was restored uninjured to my friends with a new set of double teeth.

TMmBEz clergymen, one of whom-naturally a red-haired man--re-, joiced in the name of Salter, met at a book-store.

BUTLEB   was one of the earliest Poets who delighted in flavoring his verse with eccentric rhyming. Byron has no doubt eclipsed all in this peculiarity; and although Barham, in the Ingoldsby Legends, has car- ried it to a more laborious extent, there is an apparent ease in the author of Don Juan, which places him above all competitors. A few instances will demonstrate their particular styles. i Butler's Hudibras abounds in the most apparently dissimilar sounds so strangely forced together by his hymeneal yoke of rhyme, that they involuntarily raise a laugh. Who can refuse a smile at such termina. tions as these- He measured out the moon by inches, And just as though it were mere green chees. And There was an ancient sage philosopher, Who had read Alexander. Ross over. Or And other deleterious medicines, Which those who took 'em have been ad since. And The Pulpit, drum ecclesiastic, Was beat with fist instead ofastick. Or No Indian Prince has to his palace More followers than a Thief to the gallows. And at the risk of being called profane, we cannot forbear quoting- And straight another with his flambeau, Gave Ralpho o'er his eyes a damned blow. Or That deals in Destiny's dark counsels, And sage opinions of the moon sells. Again Those wholesale critics that in coffeo Houses cry down all philosoph y.   C H I T- a H A T.            295 It is a mistake to suppose that Byron, or Whistlecraft, was the first who wrote in what is familiarly called the Don Juan Stanza. Berni, an Italian Comic Poet, wrote some poems full of vivacity, and Byron un- doubtedly caught the (" infection" from his sprightly verses. Byron, whose mastery over the English language is unrivalled, has certainly achieved several triumphs in his Don Juan, the greatest of which we consider the couplet- But oh! ye lords of ladies inteectual, Inform us truly, have they not henpece you a f  We cannot allow that Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem, As if she deemed that mystery would ennoble 'em, is equal to the previous. Of a different kind are such couplets as- They whispered he'd a mistress-some said two, But for domestic quarrels one will do. Or Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded, That all the Apostles would have done as they dd,. Or And Coleridge has explained all to the nation, I wish he would explain his explanation. We always thought that some verses written by a gentleman of New Jersey for a wager, were almost as good as anything in either Halleck or Ingoldsby.. A critic once declaring that he could find two words our Jersey friend could not rhyme to, the latter betted a bottle of Tomp- kin's Billecarte Salmon that he could.   The words were Sennacherib and Jehosaphat.  To the disappointment of the critic the lager-bier poet wrote, after a few minutes' study-- There was a monarch called Sennach/rb, Who boasted loudly that he could crack a rib Of any man, except Jehosaphat, He could not his, he weas sofat.

CASE of kid-napping-catching a juvenile goat asleep. A Mild Rebuke for Murder.-A- subordinate actor was once, on a sudden emergency, called' out from the ranks to play the part of an injured uncle. He looked upon this chance as the turning point of his professional career, and determined to make the most of it Though he had no more than some twenty lines to repeat, he insisted on throwing as much action, energy, and significance into them as if he had been a Kean or a Hicks. One passage ran thus, and was addressed to a dissolute nephew who had tried to murder him: ".For stealing my money I forgive you; but for the attempt upon my life, I cannot." The aspirant mouthed the sentence after this fashion, giving to the last words a voice of thunder: i"For stealing my money I forgive you; but for the attempt -upon my life I can't." Religions and Sauces.-When Ude first came to England, two peculiarities he met with struck him--a Frenchman, be it remembered, and a cook-with astonishment: the number of churches and chapels in London, and the frequency with which melted butter appeared on the table.

You Don't Lodge Here.-In Spain it is the ambition of grandees to unite in themselves'as many grandeeships as possible by the marriage of heiresses, whose names and titles are assumed by their husbands; whence the old story of a benighted grandee, who knocked at a lonely inn, and when asked as usual, "quien es?"

Things went on very comfortably until, the other day, the new servant was found to have hung himself in his room, and to be quite dead. Instead of using an easier means for the accomplishment of his purpose, the suicide had hung himself with a cambric handkerchief, which circum- stance was explained by a note found in his pocket, and which read somewhat to the following purport: "Mr. X--, my real name is ----, and I am, as you may readily ascertain, of family equal to your own.

The day came, the rain fell, and the people maddened, not believing the words of the seers, nor sheltering themselves from the predicted shower.

It clings to him through life-from the cradle to the grave-and cannot be rubbed out, or worn off, by any bleaching or triturating pro- cess whatever. A thoroughly vulgar person, it has been truly said, " is, like the poet, born, not made." He is vulgar in his baby-clothes--as a schoolboy--a young man-all through life. No matter how he may rise in the world-no matter how lofty the pinnacle of success to which his intellect .or good fortune may carry him-no matter how elegant, polished, or refined the society in which he mingles-the original, inherent taint always remains with him-vulgar he is doomed to be for ever. As well might you expect to see a hempen bag made into a silk purse, as such a one become refined by intercourse with good society. Keese's Retort to Gowans.-Mr. Gowans has been among books from his boyhood. He knows when to attend an auction, and what to buy. Many an Irish retort has he dealt to Keese the auctioneer, who does not every day meet such a match as Gowans, nor always suffer even then. When Keese was once selling prayer-books, Mr. G., who sat somewhat back in the company, wishing to " put upon" the rattling auctioneer slightly, interrupted the rapid vocalization with-"Are they in English?"As quick as gunpowder Keese replied--"Of course they are; do you suppose a man is going to pray in Irish?' The preceding is from the Evening Mirror, to which we may add another which came off in our presence, and has not yet got into print: One day there was in the long wareroom one of those monotonous drones of well-trained beggar-boys harping on a single string, against all questions and comers, to the tune of "Give me a penny-give me a penny-give me a penny."   There was no making any impression on him short of kicking him down stairs. A book-worm or two at the tables were getting vexed and impatient.

ONE of the very pleasantest men I ever met was William Davidge, the celebrated actor. With the sole exception of Burton, he is undoubtedly the best low comedian in America. Brougham is his equal in burlesque, but then he does not sing as well as Davidge, so that, taken " for all in all," he may be considered the first extravaganza performer of our day. Burton is not good in burlesque-he makes it buffoonery. But good as he is in burlesque on the stage, we question if some of our country managers do not beat him out of the field. He mentioned a case, which we think justifies our opinion. During his first star tour in the States, he stopped at Toledo, in Ohio, where he had an engagement to play for a week. When the rehearsal was through, the manager asked Davidge if he would like to take a drive with him in the afternoon through the town, to have a look at it. "Certainly," said the unsuspecting Roscius, "most happy."  As he was sitting after dinner at his. hotel, waiting for his friend to call with his wagon, he heard a loud blowing of horns, and immediately after, a huge caravan, containing a dozen trumpeters, with flags and banners, inscribed with "Davidge, the World renowned Comedian," "The American ZEagle for ever!" 1"Every night this Week!" &amp;c., drove up to the hotel and stopped. There sat as driver the nlanager, with a vacant seat at his side for the unfortunate Davidge, who was evidently to be tooted around to the tune of "Yankee Doodle" and other popular melo- dies,. as a sort of Fejee mermaid or boa-constrictor. Taking one despairing glance at the triumphal pyre on which he was to be burnt alive for the amusement and wonderment of the Toledoians, Davidge rushed up-stairs, jumped into bed, and had a severe attack of illness, which lasted till the great advertising Juggernaut car drove away. In the evening the manager told Davidge what a treat he had missed, for, said the Western Crumrnmles, " all the boys in the town ran after us, and shouted like mad for you to sing a comic song, so I had to palm one of the brass band off on them as the celebrated Davidge, and hang me if they didn't make him stand on his head and sing ' Villikins and his Dinah I' I shouldn't be at all surprised if they make you do the same in the course of the evening!"

The Fat-Man--Every New Yorker is no doubt aware that there are men who go about with a pail to buy the kitchen grease, and that. he is known by the name of the "Fat Man." One morning, a lady living in Houston street told her help, a raw Irish girl, to stop the first "Fat Man" shef saw, and tell him she wanted to see him. Biddy there- fore went to the window and watched, Unfortunately, Mr. B. hap- pened to be passing- on his way to the theatre, and his attention was arrested by the Irish girl calling on him to stop. The door- imme- diately opened, and Biddy rushed out, and begged Mr. B. to step in as her mistress wanted to see him. With that habitual courtesy which always distinguishes that eminent tragedian, he entered the house, and Biddy ran up-stairs to tell her mistress, who was dressing. In a minute, she came down, and said to the astonished actor, "Oh fait', missus says, what will ye be after giving her a pound?--and ye must not be after cheating her in the weight, as ye did this the last time!" B. stood astonished, and was about making some reply, when the lady herself made her appearance. She saw at a glance the blunder, -and began scolding Biddy, who cried out, "Fait', it's no mistake on my part-did not yer tell me to call in the first ' fat man' I saw --and sure here he is fat enough to be surel" The lady was profuse in her apologies, and persuaded the amused actor to take a glass of Marasching and a sardine, as a peace-offering. - WHEN a young man confidently tells you that such and such a young lady "has no heart," you may be sure that he has been trying it on, and has failed in making a favorable impression. "Tmmrt s our Gershom," said Mr. Shelton, "he must go off to the city to get his living by his wits." "Well, how did he make out f" asked a friend. "Ah!" said the old man, with a sigh, tapping his fore- head significantly, " he failed for want of capital!" CAsH helps courting along amazingly.

He accused his wife of trying to give him the scarlet fever because she had a cloak of that color, and lets the gamblers off for fear of the croup-ier. A well known publisher, who has an itching palm for the author's profit, lately got off serving on a jury, by a judi- cious appeal to the old judge's phobia. When his name was called he made his appearance and his bow, but when he was about being sworn, he whispered to the judge, "Yo r honor had better excuse me." "Why " said the judge. "Because," replied the publisher, "I've got the itch." "Scratch him off," roared the judge, as he waved the infectious man away. Titles.-Several years ago there was a young English nobleman figuring away at Wahington. He had not much brains, but a vast number of titles, which, notwithstanding our pretended dislike to them, have sometimes the effect of tickling the ear amazingly. Several young ladies were in debate, going over the list-he is Lord Viscount So-and- so, Baron of such a county, &amp;c. "My fair friends," exclaimed the gal- lant Lieutenant N--,1 " one of his titles you appear to have forgotten." "Ah!" exclaimed they eagerly, "what is that"   "He is Barren of Intellect," was the reply . What Literature Is.-Poetry is said to be the flower of literature; prose is the corn, potatoes, and meat; satire is the aquafortis; wit is the spice and pepper; love-letters are the honey and suggar; letters con- taining remittances are the apple-dumplings. A MTrrIA officer wanted to compliment a negro by drinking with him.  "Well, captain, Ize berry dry, so I won't be ugly 'bout it. Some niggas is too proud to drink with a milishy ossifer--but I think a mili- shy ossifer, when sober, is just as good as a nigga-'specially if the nigga is dry." A Comparison.-- A pleasant, cheerful wife is a rainbow set in the sky, when her husband's mind is tossed with storms and tempests; but a dissatisfied and fretful wife, in the hour of trouble, is like one of those fiends who delight to torture lost spirits.  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7492-00000160"/> 806          c0HxIT- OH  T.

Idleness is the murderer of time and the destroyer of comfort; it is the rich man's bane, the tradesman's ruin, and the poor man's curse. Genius, like an exotic plant, is rare; and requires not only the same care and attention to bring it to perfection, but also a shelter from the squalls of fortune and the frosts of adversity, without which it will wither and die. CAN'T HELP HMSELF. A CLEBRATED American tragedian relates -an incident in his life which is well worth remembering, not alone as affording hope to the despair- ing, but as a caution to the arrogant. On arriving at Philadelphia, he put up at Jones's Hotel, where he was shown to a room in which there were two beds. Not wishing that. the scanty nature of his wardrobe, which boasted only one shirt, and that was out at wash, should be discovered by his room-mate, he undressed before his unknown companion arrived, and he was fast asleep when he came. Morning dawned-there in the bed at the other end lay the other occupant of the room, and who was in a similar predica- ment himself   Roscius lay patiently for some time expecting his unconscious spy would get up, and leave him an opportunity to dress without his shirtless condition being perceived; but there the fellow lay, as though on purpose to irritate the other. At length his impa- tience got the better of his manners, and he said--"Sir, it's getting late." "I know it is," replied the other, "'but I am not an early riser. I am fond of my morning's nap."' Disappointed in this attempt, our friend relapsed into a gloomy silence, and mentally sent, free of all travelling expenses, the sluggard to the devil. In about half an hour the breakfast bell rang. Seizing this opportu- nity, Roscius cried out, "Hallo, Sir I if you don't get up at once you'll lose your breakfast. There's the bell 1"     I The other merely thanked him for his politeness in telling him, add- ing, "I never eat breakfast." "Confound the fellow," exclaimed the actor, "he's worse'than a cannibaL:. Obstinacy being even then a prominent point in our hero's character,   - HT-OH AT.             807 he lay like another Raglan before Sebastopol, not waiting, however, for his foe to fall, but to rise. Time wore on-faint snoring, like a murmuring cannonading, was heard, but all quiet in his trench lay the obstinate enemy. At last the dinner gong was heard. "Sir," cried our hero, " there's the dinner bell You'll lose your dinner, if you don't get up at once." "The devil 's in it now," thought our friend, "but 'll get him up this time." To his horror and despair his companion said, "Thank you kindly, sir, for your polite attention; but I never dine till six in the evening, and having nothing to do to-day, I may as well lie in bed till then." This was too much. Throwing off the coverlet, the future Metamora sprang out of bed, and glared like a tiger at his tormentor as he cried, "Well, if -I must; I must-here goes; beware how you betray the secret of my soul!" "Oh!" exclaimed the other, " that 's why you wanted me to- get up first-how funny I I have no shirt also-and have been wishing you at the devil for your lying in bed." They then both laughed heartily at the fate of genius. Tomb-stone Literature.--In Augusta there are some strange dirges for the dead: among others are these- "Here beneath this stone there lies, Waiting a summons to the skies, The body of Samuel Jenking; He was an honest Christian man, His fault was that he took and ran Suddenly to drinking; Whoever reads this tablet o'er, Take warning now, and drink no more."

Eternity.-4An American clergyman, in one of his sermons, exclaimed to his hearers:--"Eternity I why you don't know the meaning of that word, nor I neither, hardly. It is for ever and ever, and five or six everlastings a-top of that. You might place a row of figures from here to sunset, and cipher them all up, and it wouldn't begin to tell how many ages long eternity is. Why, my friends, after millions and tril- lions of years had rolled away in eternity, it would be a hundred thou- sand years to breakfast-time." Truisms.--Borrowed garments seldom fit well Haste often trips up its own heels. Men often blush to hear what they are not ashamed to act. Pride is the flower that grows in the devil's garden.

The other walrus, with its cubs, rolled into the water; but the younger one of the stricken females remained with its dam; upon these helpless creatures the bear now leaped down, and thus completed the destruction of the two animals, which it would not have ventured to attack openly. The stratagems practised in taking large seals are much less to be admired.  These creatures are remarkably timid, and for that reason always lie to bask or sleep on the very edge of the piece of -floating ice, so that on the slightest alarm they can, by one roll, tumble themselves into their favorite element. They are exceedingly restless, constantly moving their heads from side to side, and sleeping by short naps. As with all wild creatures, they turn their attention to the direction of the wind, as if expecting danger from  that quarter. The bear, on seeing his intended prey, gets quickly into the water, and swims till he is to leeward of him, from whence, by frequent short divest he silently makes his approaches, and so arranges the distance jthat at his last dive he comes up   to the spot where the seal is lying. If the poor animal attempts to escape by rolling into the water,. he falls into the bear's clutches; if, on the contrary, he lies still, his destroyer makes a power- ful spring, kills him on the ice, and devours him at his leisure.

IT is told somewhere in ancient history, and has been somewhat ungal- lantly dug up and repeated in The Spectator by Addison-who, having but little manly force, was little loved by women-that some old father of the Church, soured perhaps by the compulsory isolation of his lot, defined the gentler sex as Zxov 0XoKoaPov, which means, in our Saxon tongue, an animal that rejoices in finery. We question, however, for ourselves, whether this passion is confined to the gentler sex, and whether, while men have, with their usual saucy self-esteem, been satirizing the extravagance and absurdity of female apparel, they have not outstripped them themselves in excess or caprice of fashion. Men have worn in their day just as much fine lace, jewelry, gold, and em- broidery, and such trumpery and tinsel, as did ever women. If women carry even now a little mirror stealthily in their fans, how many fashionable Counts are there who may be found in the ante-rooms at a reception with one slily concealed in their pockets . In these days, however, we are bound to admit that men cannot be accused of any over-indulgence in extravagance in dress With the exception of. some vulgar snobs who plant in their shirt-breasts a plot of paste which they jocularly call a diamond, not an article is left in man's wardrobe which can lend to him even a fictitious brilliancy for a moment. The staunchest Puritan could not have- desired anything more horrible than men's modern costume. But in women the instinct of dress, and sometimes, we fear, of extra- vagance, is still strong; and as he who lounges may read, as we some- times walk down Broadway and meet occasionally a lady in large pattern and gaudy colors, with rich flounces in the morning, shoals of sham laces, mock furs, and paste jewels, we are half driven out of our gallantry, and tempted to believe there was some truth in the splenetic   OHT-OHAT.            8" saying of the old father: "That woman is an animal who delights in finery." Such a class of women are doubtless essential to milliners, as, having no taste of their own, they usually submit to carry the forlorn hope of last year's finery under the delusive title of " the very latest fashion."' Doubtless for such the celebrated St. Nicholas bridal-chamber was clad in such gaudy vulgarity; though we are glad to record that- save on one occasion by a magnificent golden parvenu from San Fran- cisco--its serenity has never been disturbed. With such ladies price is everything, becomigness of little moment. The other day we saw it mentioned that a lady of New Orleans had given at the Crystal Palace of Paris no less a sum than 16,000 for her bridal dress. We are ashamed to own that we had hitherto believed that this tawdriness was a vice of our young country, which a more refined taste would gradually correct. But in the last Paris journals we learn that, whether from the spirit of excited competition or national vanity wounded by the gay recklessness of expenditure of our New Orleans belle, we have been completely outstripped by Paris, hitherto the great autocrat of fashion, at least in the extravagance of "sheets" and " man- chettes." By the fashionable journals of that delightful capital we are informed that the Marchioness De Hallory, "n6e Princesse de Chimay," who had been a " pratique" of Madame Bunel-Marechal, expended on her sheets the "prix fou" of $221 a pair. The article on which this "n6e Princesse" expended her extravagant caprice is slightly singular; and as its perfections could only be appreciated by one, or at best two persons, displays a singular disinterestedness of character. We have not inquired the cost of the sheets in the bridal chamber of the St. Nicholas Hotel, as we deemed such inquiry might be looked on as a prying impertinence, but ,we rather fancy the Marchioness De Hallory, " n6e Princesse de Chimay," has fairly thrown that magnificent institution into the shade. When will women learn that to; beauty and perfection of attire cost is but a small essential. A really well dressed lady pays no attention to milliners' and shopmen's suggestions. She studies her own nature and points, and what is becoming to them. You do not say, on seeing her, '; What a charming bonnet 1" "What a splendid shawl!" "How much did it cost?" but without resting the eye on any one particular, whisper to yourself, "What a lady-like looking person!"About her is no tinsel or trumpery, velvet bands, diamonds on the- head and cameos on the stomach; but everything, to the smallest beading and most  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7492-00000163"/> 812           O H IT-, cE A T. peeping border, is neat, delicate, and fresh.

Seriously speaking, there is no worse used class in existence than the publishers Every author, whether prose or con, verse or reverse, hysterical or historical, has had a dig at their ribs; indeed, we believe that publishers by this time are all bachelors, not being able to afford the torturing luxury of a rib. simply because of the poking. Let us record some of the hard things authors have said against pub- lishers  Coleridge called them "the cormorants that sat on the tree of knowledge, gobbling up all the fruit, and defrauding the owner thereof." ' Byron would have it that the Divine condemnation written against Barabbas was much severer in the original than we are aware of since the exact words were-"Now Barabbas was a   publisher;" but some friend  of the fashionable Murray, Bentley, Longman, Harpers, or Stringer of that day, getting hold of the original MSs, altered it to "robber,' which is certainly a far milder form of expression.

When publishers, like other gentlemen, quarrel, then the truth comes-out, and Dickens relates, in those manuscript memoirs, his din- ner-table conversations, an illustrative anecdote of B. and C. These two eminent and, it must be confessed, most liberal men, were partners for some years. A  slight misunderstanding between their wives led to an estrangement, which soon,became an open rupture. The real matter in dispute was perfectly alien to their interests, turning upon that celebrated author, Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer. The publishers' wives differed upon the relative merits of Bulwer, male, and Bulwer,female. Another case of Bull and Cow.  The result was, as might be expected, a fierce war between the hus. bands, for when bull-dogs quarrel, the husbands are coa-ards. Pierce Pungent, who is a jolly old bachelor, with the chill off, says that he has doubts upon the man-ufacture of women.   He, like every full-blooded man, believes that Heaven made man, but that another state made woman, and, like all imitations, she was a long way behind the great original.   ,  Let us give a specimen of the conversations that resulted from this quarrel between the wives of these Barabbi: B.-Ah I Jones, how do ye do I Do you see that desk I Jrones.-Certainly.

One of the seraph ,band I feel beside me stand, Tripping beside me as in days gone by : Once more his little feet, With my long steps compete- I pace along, nor dare to turn mine eye.

Facts like these prove, unquestionably, that poetry is a gift, not an art; that poeta nascitur nonfit; that genius, like the will of that Being of whose breath it is a minor inspiration, iv sovereign, and, like the wind, blow- eth where it listeth. Shakspere might have been a chimney-sweep, instead of a stage- player; Burns might have been a hind, instead of a farmer-holding his own plough; and Bunyan a camp-sutler, instead of a soldier, in the Parliamentary army.                ; Let, then, the stage-player, the tinker, and the gauger, appear for a moment together upon our stage. The first is a swarthy and Spaniard- looking man, with tall forehead, sharp sidelong eyes, dark hair curling over his lips and chin, and firm, deep-cut nostril. The second has a fresh complexion, auburn locks, round brow, hair on his upper lip after the old English fashion, and sparkling, glowing eyes, not the least like those of a dreamer, but resembling rather the eyes of " some hot amourist," as John Woodvil hath it.  The third has a broad low brow, palpitating with thought and suffering, eyes shivering in their great round orbs- with emotion, like the star Venus in the orange west, nostril slightly curved upwards, dusky skin, black masses of hair, and dimpled, undecisive chin and cheek. All three have imagination as their leading faculty, but that of the player is as wide as the globe; that of the tinker is intense, almoststo lunacy; and that of the gauger is narrow and vivid as a stream of forked lightning. All three have strong intel- lect, but the intellect of the one is capricious, that of the other casuistic, and that of the third clear.. All are partially educated, but Shaklspere's culture is that of the society of his age, Bunyan's that of solitary read- ing, and Burns' of a compound of both. All are men of " one book," Shaklapere's being the universe, Bunyan's the Bible, and Burns' the ballad poetry of Scotland. All are men of intensely ardent tempera- ment, which in Shakspere is subdued by the width of the mind in which the furnace glows, which in Bunyan becomes a purged flame, but which in poor Burns bursts out of all restraint into a destructive conflagration. In the works of all, materiem superat opus, the genius of Shanlspere flaming out of mean structures of farce and tragi-comedy, Bunyan's power overflowing the banks of narrow controversial treatises, and the great soul of Burns o'er-informing the tenement of fugitive poems, jeux  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7492-00000165"/> 816  -O HT-OHAT. d'esprit, satires, and -semi-scandalous ballads. All sprang from the people, but while Shakspere and Burns belonged to its upper stratum, Bunyan appeared amid its lowest dregs, like a new creation amid the slush of chaos. -'All had something of a religious tendency, but while in Shakspere it takes a vague diffusive form, and in Burns never amounts to much more than what he himself calls " an idiotic piety," in Bunyan it becomes a deep burning principle of thought and action, at. once swallowing up arid sanctifying his native genius. The fate of the three was curious and characteristic. Shakspere, the sublime stage-player, outliving his early self, with those mysterious errors which are partially revealed in his sonnets, subsided into a decent, retired, self-indulgent gentleman, like a dull, sleepy, soaking evening following a day of blended storm and splendor.  Burns, after many a vain attempt tfo rally against the isfortunes and sins of his life and temperament, fell down at last their proud recalcitrating victim, dying and making but dubious signs; while John Bunyan, strong in supernal might, victorious over his tendencies, having bound his very madness in chains, and turned his tears and tortures into the elements of hope and triumph, crossed the black river, singing in concert with the shining'ones, and passed into eternity, perfect through suffering, and resembling rather one of its own native children than a poor bur- deled sinner from the City of Destruction. Philosophers might specu- late long and vainly on the causes of those very different destinies. Our theory is the simple Christian one-God endowed the three with almost commensurate powers, but one only, through patient struggle and solemn search, reached the blessed hope and new life of Christianity.  THE HABP AND THE POET. THE wind, before it woos the harp, Is but the wild and tuneless air; But as it passes through the string%, Changes to music there. E'en so the poet's soul converts The cobmmon things that round him lie, Into a glorious stream of song-- Divinest melody. Sweet harp and poet framed alike By God as His interpreters, To breathe aloud the silent thought Of everything that stirs.   o IIIT-HAT.    ,          817 CHAUCER. GEOFFREY CHAUCER, the father of English poetry, was born in 1328, and. died in 1400. His works are a complete picture of the times, as he described English nature with wonderful minutice in his Canterbury Tales. Indeed, in his prologue to those exquisite productions, he has classified the nation as it then existed, as though he were making out a catalogue for a Barnum's museum. Among others, we have the knight, the squire, the scholar, the wife, the nun, the prior, the monk, the ser- jeant at law, the sumptner, the pardonere, the merchant, the host, the miller, and various other distinct denominations of society. All these portraits are inimitably painted, and evidently to the life. What can be sweeter than his picture of the Nun?- "There was also a nun, a prioress, That of her smiling was full simple and coy; Her greatest oath was by the Saint Eloy: And she was called the Madame Eglantine. Full well she sang the services divine Entuned through her nose full sweetly: And French she spake full faire and fetisly After the school of Stratford of Bow Town-- For French of Paris was to her unknown!" This last line is a sly sarcasm at the queer pronunciation taught at the nunneries-just as though our Halleek were to!" pitch" into the accent taught at Madame Chegary's, or any other fashionable ladies' seminary of New York. 'How charmingly the old Britisher, then in the full swing of his Anglo-Saxon-Norman blood, discourses of this type of pious womanhood. Her gentility at the dinner table is thus hit- "At meat she was most well behaved withalL She let no morsel from her fair lips fall, Nor dipped her fingers in her saucer deep." Think of that, ye fair of the nineteenth century, and be taught by a well bred lady of five centuries ago. ChauCer winds up his inventory of her perfections with one of the sweetest lines in the whole range of poetry-- And ill was conscience and a tender heart." In bold relief to this exquisite picture-which we should like to see transferred into colors by that admirable artist, Charles Loring Elliott, the greatest portrait painter America has produced, and far superior to  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7492-00000166"/> 818             H' T-OHAT. the boasted Sir Thomas Lawrence, -of England--we turn to the Monk in whose likeness old Geoffrey has revelled-- "A monk there was- A manly man, to be an abbot able, Full many a dainty horse had he in stable: And when he rode men might his bridle here, ARl jingling in the whistling wind as clear, And eke as loud as doth the chapel bell, There as this lord was keeper of the cell." How finely the poet paints the Abbot's disbelief in those parts of Scrip- ture which condemn his favorite pastimes; such as- "He cared not for the text a pullet hen, Which says; ' Tat hinters be not holy men.' I saw his sleeve was purfiled at the hand, With lace, and that the finest in the land: And to keep fast his hood beneath his chin, He'had of finest gold a curious pin: A love-knot in the larger end there was: His head was bald, and shone like any glass, And eke his face as it had been anoint: He was a lord full fat, and in good point. His eye was deep, and rolling in his head, He was not pale as is a famished ghost: /     A fat swan loved he best of any roast." Who does not recognise; in the- jolly man of God of the fourteenth, the well paid, well fed parson of the days of Franklin Pierce? : The sejeant at law, whose, bones have been -dust four hundred years, is also alive in his descendants of the present day-in the Dick Mounts, O'Connors, Bradies, J. Wades, Wilsons, Dunn Littells, and other eminent counsellors--- "Nowhere so busy a man as he there n'as: And yet he seemed busier than he was." If old -Dan Chaucer" had-Bailie Watson in his eye he could not have hit him off better. As Chaucer seems to have had compunction about the manner in which he had treated the Monk, he makes the amende honorable in his "poure parson."  This, however, is too long to quote entire, and it would be "murder" to mangle it by making extracts.      Suffice it that Pope's Man of Rosm is a feeble imitation of Chaucer's magnificent   OH IT-OH AT.             8'19 picture. Nor can there be a finer full length daguerreotype than his Franklin and Reve--" that slender, cholerick man." What gives a greater interest to these characters is the fact that they are undoubtedly painted from the life, as men actually met with and seen by the great narrative poet of England. As a specimen of his power in another department, we quote his Address to Death- , Not even Death, alas I will take my life. Thus walk I forth like a restless caitiff, And on the ground, which is my mother's gate, I knock with this old staff both early and late. And say to her, 'Dear mother, let me in I Lo! how I wither flesh, and blood, and skin I Alas! when shall my old bones be at rest? Mother, with you would I might. change the chest, That in my chamber a long time hath been, Yea, for a linen shroud to wrap me in.' But yet to me she will not vouch that grace, For which full pale and haggard is my face." It is needless to point out to the poetical reader the simple majesty and profound pathos of this passage. The readiness with which he would give his money chest, so long hoarded in his chamber, for " a linen shroud," is full of meaning; while the total absence of all " attempt to be grand" makes old Chaucer positively sublime. Some years ago, a volume of some of his finest poems was published in London under the title of Chaucer Modernized.   Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt, Mrs. Brown- ing, Pierce Pungent, Robert Bell, and R. HL Horne were the modernizers, and did their best in all reverence to dust away some of the cobwebs oftime.                       ' "You say, Mrs. Barkins, that you are 4 widow-is that so  The court supposed that you married last ranth." "Sho I did, but my hus- band is all der time sick mit der typhus, so I am no better ash a vidder, only vorse."  The court ruled .' Mrs- Barkins' favor, and allowed the case to proceed.

PMSONAL SEETCH OF LEtG HMNT THE personnel of John Henry Leigh Hunt-for such was he christened, and such was the name' under which he tpublished his first volume of poems--is very:prepossessing. Invariably dressing i' black, his tall figure gives him the appearance of an Italian nobleman. Margaret Gillies has done an excellent portrait of him on ivory, which has not yet been engraved. The boyish face, which disgraced his foolish and malignant volume called Byron and his Contemporaries, is a mise- rable abortion, and justified the saying of Talfourd, that it looked more like a man who had. a stolen tankard concealed under his cloak than an author. His hair, which was once black, is now quite grey, and grows low on his forehead; this he wears parted in. the front, and somewhat hanging down on his shoulders; having discarded whiskers, his face, which is really very small,. looks: well proportioned. :His chin is feeble; but his nose, though somewhat small, is delicately chiselled. The chief feature is the eye, which is a fine hazel-large, and full of thought-as a friend said one day, " you can see it thinking." His voice is peculiar --full, soft, and musically subdued ; his manner of reciting a joke or anecdote is very'charming-even a commonplace word sounds plea- santly in his mouth. His courtesy is extreme; we never heard him intentionally wound the feelings of any one, although we have seen him sometimes unsparingly attacked to his face. We especially recollect one occasion when a young lady whom he had annoyed by some remarks on Byron, give him a newspaper containing Moore's celebrated- verses on the "PuppyrDog and Dead Lion," wherein Leigh' Hunt is held up to execration, and ridiculed in that witty poet's best manner. ,He saw the I whole intent in an instant, and after reading them to himself, cried out --"These are the beat verses of the kind I ever read; even I can enjoy them; they are so witty that I forgive hin." He then read them aloud to the :company with great gusto. An evening with Leigh Hunt is not to be soon forgotten. He is fond of talking, and as he talks admirably, no one thinks him tedious. First you have an anecdote, then a quotation from some poet, charmingly given and explained; after a while he will stroll to the piano or sera- phine, and play some Italian barcarolle, singing the words with wonder- ful expression. From this he will rush into one of the "Beggars' Opera") favorite songs; he often stops at the end of "a beautiful passage, and plays it over again with a lingering affection,; as though he could not break away from the fascination. When that is finished, he will turn   OH I T - HA T.           -821 round on the music stool, and relate some little,interesting fact con- nected with music, and this will remind him of some other tune, and so on for a couple of hours. When he rises you are surprised to find he is a tall old man of seventy. His voice is very sweet and effective, although he humorously expresses astonishment when he grows a little husky. Notwithstanding that he is a very temperate man, he enjoys with high Christian relish a good glass of wine, and delights in quoting Walter Mapes's drinking song, the first verse of which he has thus rendered: ' I devise to end my days in a tavern drinking, May some angel hold for me the glass when I am shrinking, That the cherubim may cry when they see me- sinking, ' Heaven be merciful to a soul of this gentleman's way of thinking.?" He is somewhat too fond of puns, but there is a lightness about them which will render them excusable even in Sam Johnson's estimation. As a dramatist he is not so well known as his genius deserves; he has been judged by the "Legend of Florence," which, although a beautifully conceived and written play, is not so dramatically carried out as it might have been-even as it is, the denouement was altered to suit the absurd conventional taste of the English public. As the. author wrote it, he made the Pope pronounce the separation of the husband from the wife.           "   .. Odd enough, the author prophesied that his drama would not be very successful The writer of this accompanied him to the theatre, on the first night of the performance, and was much amused at the solemn tone in which, after having surveyed the house, he said, just as the cur- tain rose-"This play will not do; there are too many husbands in the house!"Our readers may remember that the thing turns upon a tyran- nical husband, who, however is. a most respectable man otherwise, although he does oppress his wife. It was performed fifteen times, and brought the author 195 (about $1,000), which at that period was a great god-send to him.- Leigh: Hunt has a large family, with whom he lives in great har- mony; his eldest son, Thornton, is of considerable attainments, and edited the "Spectator" newspaper for some years; he is also the author 'of "The Foster Son," a novel which has been reprinted here. His second son, Henry, is in a Government office. His youngest, Vincent, is devoted to a literary life. He has three girls-Marian (married), "*  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7492-00000168"/> 822            a I T - HA'T. - Jacyntha, and Julia. Mrs. Hunt is devotedly attached to her husband, believes him to be the greatest of living poets, and heartily hates Lord Byron's memory/ Dickens has immortalized the author of Rimini in his character of E Harold Skimpole, in the novel of Bleak House. It is certainly the most skilful of his malignant caricatures. Dying upon the French Stage.-The French have such an aversion to any of their Dramatis Persona dying on the stage, that in the opera of "Artaxerxes," when Artabanes falls lifeless in the arihs of the at- tendants, he usually gives a little kick with his foot, as the curtain drops, to show that he has not violated the rules, by dying upon the stage. EARTH AND HEAVEN. MORTALS i why thus toil away, Even to your dying day, For the meat that perisheth? Wist ye not that your first breath Is the beginning of your death, And that the path of king and slave Are but straight roads to the graveP Who, gazing on a gentle bride, With the loved one by her side, Can read in her delighted eye, The tears she shed in infancy? And e'en as little can we trace The death-calm stealing o'er that faco, Which, whatsoever now its bloom, Soon will moulder in the tomb. REPITAPHS. Taz Rose of Utica, by which title a young lady of that city is known, on account of her virtues and beauty, told us, some days since, an epi- taph, which carries grave fun to its last limit: ON A Pam OP TWINr. Here lies two twins, as dead as nits, One died of measles--t'other of fits. While we are on this subject, we may as well relieve our memory of   OHT-CHAT.               828 some execrable verses our friend Davidge, the eminent comedian, wrote upon this self-same belle. Meeting her one morning in the Hoboken Ferry Boat, he told her, "She really looked the Rose of Utica." Our fair friend, Helen, frown- ingly said, "Don't flatter; I dislike it." We ought to mention that she generally wears a very handsome pink satin bonnet. Anxious to be restored to her good graces, he scratched his head, and wrote in a book, which he presented her with as a sort of excuse for his billet-doux : TO THE WEARER OF ROSY CHEEKS AND A ROSY-COLOBED NAT. In ca ling you the Rose of Utica, It can't be said, fair Helen, that I flatter, For as you wear the head, as well as hat, I merely praise Great Nature, or your Hatter. Robert Montgomery, the well known fashionable preacher of Percy Chapel, author of Satan, Woman, Omnipresence, &amp;c., when asked to write some verses under his own portrait, which an admirer of his had placed in her album, actually penned, in sober earnest, the following: UNDER MY OWN PORTRAIT. Ardent, enthusiastic, gentle, wild, Too soon a man, and yet too late a child. Beloved by some, misunderstood by more, And rich in talent, though in fortune poor. This coming to the ears of Dr. Maginn, that incorrigible enemy of all humbug parodied it thus, for Maclise's portrait of Satan Montgomery, which was published in Fraser's Magazine. Ardent, enthusiastic, gentle Bob; Too soon a parson, yet too late a snob: Laughed at by some-not read at all by more, And rich in rubbish-though in talent poor: These verses that so neatly trips o, Were written by Bob Montgomery de e/peso. Perhaps of all mock epitaphs, that on Charles the Second, by Lord Rochester, is the best: Here lies our Sovran lord, the King, Whose word no man relies on: Who never said a foolish thing, Or ever did a wis one. For severity, however, this is matched by an epigram upon a well known Brooklyn clergyman, who, from being an actor, full of the tricks of that mimic trade, became a preacher of considerable eminence.  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7492-00000169"/> 824           OHT-COH   T. Many circumstances combined to make his conversion rather doubtful, and his being a very bad actor led our poet to write- ON A BEVEREND RosCIvs. Tompkins, the actor, failed in every part, Lacking at once all genius for his art, But in the pulpit all who see him, swear, Tompkins indeed's a perfect actor there. We call him Tompkins, although that is not his real name, which is Smith, but this we withheld-to avoid wounding his feelings. THE JEALOUS DOG. TmE following singular' story is related by Judge Halliburton, in his re- cent work entitled "Nature and Human Nature:" Last summer, my duties sent me to George's Island&amp;  I take it for granted you know it. It is a small island, situated in the cenitre of the harbor of Ha;lifax-has a powerful battery on it, and barracks for the accommodation of troops. There was a company of my regiment stationed there at the time. I took this Newfoundland dog and a small terrier, called Tilt, in the boat with me. The latter was a very active little fellow that the General had given me a few weeks before. He was such an amusing creature that he soon became an universal favorite, and was suffered to come into the house, a privilege which was never granted to this gentleman, who paid no regard to the appearance of his coat, which was often wet and dirty, and was therefore excluded. The consequence was, Thunder was jealous, and would not associate with him, and if he ever took any liberty, he turned on him and punished him severely. This, however, he did not do in my presence, as he knew I would not suffer it, and, therefore, when they both accom- panied me in my walks, the big dog contented himself with treating the other with perfect indifference and contempt. Upon this occasion Thun- der lay down in the boat and composed himself to sleep, while the little fellow, who was full of life and animation, and-appeared as if he did not know what it was to close his eyes, sat up, look'ed over the gunwale, and seemed to enjoy the thing uncommonly. He watched the motions of the men, as if he understood what was required of them, and was anxious they should acquit themselves properly.' After having made my inspection, I returned to the boat, for the purpose of recrossing to the town, when I missed the terrier. Thunder   OH I T-  I .          826 was close at'my heels, and when I whistled for the Her, wagged his tail and looked up in my face, as if he would say, nev, mind that foolish dog, I am here, and that is enough; or is there anyv4g you want me to do                    .  After calling in vain, I went back to the barracks, and inquired of the men for Tilt, but no one appeared -to have seen him or noticed his motions . After perambulating the little island in vain, I happened to ask the sentry if he knew where he was. "Yes, sir," said he, " he is buried in the beach." Buried in the beach," said I, with great anger, "who dared to kill him  - Tell me, sir, immediately." .  , That large dog did it, sir.- He enticed him down to the shore, by playing with him, pretending to crouch and then run after him; and then retreating, and coaxing him to'chase after him; and when he got near to the beach he throttled him in an instant, and then scratched a hole in the shingle and buried him, covering him up, with the gravel. After that he went into the water, and with his paws washed his head and face, shook himself, and went up to the barracks. You will find the terrier just down there, sir.". And sure enough there was the poor little fellow, quite dead, and yet warm. -In the meantime, Thunder, who had watched our proceedings from a distance, as. soon as he saw the body exhumed, felt as if there was a court-martial holding over himself, plunged him into the harbor, and swam across to the town, and hid himself for several days, until he thought the affair had blown over; and then approached me anxiously and cautiously, lest he should. be condemned. As I was unwilling to lose both my dogs, I was obliged-to overlook it, and take him back to my confidence. A QUAKER JUMPING A DITCH HEZEKIAH Broadbrim was a fat Quaker who sold molasses, od-fish, china, earthenware, lothes-and all sorts of liquors. We like the Quakers, in deed as well as in name, and Hezekiah was a Hickory Quaker. He was somewhat of an old bachelor, and had a sister that wao somewhat of an old maid. But she was the best creature alive; straight as a candle, blooming as a rose, and smiling as charity. Her name was Dorcas.            .       .     -  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7492-00000170"/> 826           OHT-OHAT. Hezekiah anfi0oreas walked one Sunday afternoon, in the blooming month of MAY, to breathe the fresh air and view the meadows. The walking was smooth and delightful, with no manner of obstructions, eyeept here and there a ditch, full;of water, spanned by a few bridges, and too wide for a man of ordinary jumping capacity to cross at a single bound. But Hezekiah valued himself as fat people generally do, on his agility, and, instead of walking a few rods for the sake of a bridge, he must needs leap every ditch he came to. "Thee'd better not try that, Hezekiah," said the kind and considerate sister. "Never thee mind, Dorcas," replied Hezekiah, "there's no danger; Ive jumped a bigger ditch when I wasn't half my present size." "All that's very likely, but recollect thee's grown exceedingly pussy since thee was a young man." "Pussy! Well, if I have, that's no reason why I shouldn't be as agile as before; I tell thee, Dorcas, I can jump this ditch without as much as touching a finger." "Aye, but thee'1 touch thy feet, to the bottomr" ' Thee's but a woman, Dorcas, and thy fears magnify this ditch even to a river. Now stand thee aside, that I may have a sweep, according to my abilitiea" "Nay, brother Hezekiah, thee'd better not. The ditch is wide and the bottom muddy--and thee'll assuredly spoil thy Sunday clothes, if no worse." "Oh, fudge for your fears, girl; they shall not stay me a jot. Nay, do not hold me, for I am resolved to jump this ditch, if it were merely to convince thee of my agility." Accordingly, Hezekiah went back a few yards,- in order that he might have a fair run, and that the impulse thereof might carry him over. Having retraced far enough, he came forward with a momentum pro- portioned to his weight and velocity--and found himself in the ditch. The water splashed around on all sides, and bespotted the Sunday clothes of Dorcas, who could not, with all her Quaker sobriety and kind feeling, help bursting into a loud laugh. There was Hezekiah showing his agility, and floundering in -the mud like a whale I The water was not so deep as to be dangerous, and the seene was too irresistibly comic for even a saint to abstain from laughing, though on the Lord's day. At length, when her risibility would allow her power of speech,   OHT-OHA T.            827 Dorcas kindly held out her hand, and said, "Come hither, Hezekiah, and I'll help thee out." "Well, well," returned the flounderer, in a tone of vexation,-" thee does well, Dorcas, to stand there and laugh at me-as though it were mere sport to see me stick in the mud and water up to my very middle 1' "Nay, nay, Hezekiah, thou hast shown thy agility so marvellously that I could not help being pleased, for the life- of me--and now I take to shame myself for opposing thee so strenuously, or having doubted thy capacity for jumping. But if thee's satisfied with thy exploit, and ready to come forth, I will lend thee a hand to help thee out." Thus saying, Dorcas drew near the ditch, but Hezekiah, having got himself in by his unaided power, declared he would get himself out in the same way. But the mud was deep and adhesive; and as he got one foot out he got the other in,; and thus he continued to labor and plunge till he was satisfied his own ability was better calAoulated to help him in than to help him out of the ditch. He grew wroth, and so far forgot the plain language that he exclaimed, "By-- "Don't thee swear, brother Hezekiah," interrupted Dorcas. "Swear!" roared Hezekiah, "thee'd sweear, too, if thee was in here!" "Swear not at all, Hezekiah, but even lend me thine hand, and I'll use my ability to pull thee out, according to the Scripture, which sayeth -If thine ox or thine ass fall into a ditch on the Sabbath day-" "Now, sister Dorcas, thee is-too bad. Verily, thee should not make me so heavy as the former animal, nor so stupid as the latter." "As to thy weight," returned Dorcas, "thee must be pretty well satisfied by this time; and, as to thy stupidity, it were indeed unsisterly to liken thee to the long-eared animal. But if thee is satisfied on these points, and will forthwith reach me thine hand, rI' do as much as in me lieth to bring thee safe on land." Hezekiah was pretty well convinced by this time that his own ability would never fetch him out; wherefore, humbly reaching his hand to Dorcas, he said--"Verily, sister, I will accept thine aid, inasmuch as my own ability hath deceived me." Dorcas kindly lent her assistance; and pulling vigorously, Hezekiah at 1ngth came to land. Shaking off the mud and water like a spaniel, he returned home; but charged his sister by the way never to mention how he came to his catastrophe. Dorcas promised, of course, and as she was a girl of truth and kind feeling, she was as good as her word. But once or twice, when they were in company with sundry other ,  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7492-00000171"/> 828            H IT- H AT.

It is in this aspect alone that we consider Rogers so remarkable. As a poet he is merely a graceful versifier-he is a dilution of Goldsmith, Pope, and Akenside. As a conversationist he was rather anecdotical than philosophical; and above all he delighted in literary on dits, sometimes verging on the confines of scandal. .       M A good-tempered, liberal man in his personal dealings with mankind, he was fond of bitter and sarcastic repartees, sometimes sacrificing the humanities of life in their gratification; . His " good-tempered " joke about the Cushmans is a case in point. Miss Susan Cushman one day remarking that she did not think she could marry an Englishman, was asked by Rogers the reason. The lady replied, "Oh, they are not masculine enough for me." "Then, why, if you want something very masculine, why don't you marry your sister Charlotte?" Indeed, so famous was the old banker for his retorts, that the John Bull newspaper used to attribute all the floating repartees of the day to the tongue of ." Old Sam," as they somewhat profanely called the Patri- arch of Letters and Ledgers. ,Some years ago considerable curiosity was created in the literary   O t HT-O HAT.           829 circles of London, by the whisper that an unpublished poem of Lord Byron's was in the hands of Lady Blessington. It also leaked out that it was a most merciless satire upon Samuel Rogers, who had been for so many years his companion and friend. The public curiosity was soon gratified by its publication in Fraser's Magazine. It certainly is the bitterest thing ever written, and nothing but the reputation of Mr. Rogers for being an unsparing satirist him- self, prevented the bard, thus, as it were, assailed from the grave, from receiving " a large crop " of gleneral sympathy. The verses were known to have been written, but Byron, when asked for a copy, always said that he had destroyed them   It however appears that he gave them to Lady Blessington, who, for some slight shown to her by Rogers, gave them to Fraser. Leigh Hunt told me that Byron gave a dinner-party to a few of his friends, among whom present was Rogers, who, having an engagement, left early in the evening. When he had gone, Byron said to one of them, "Be so good as to lift up the cushion of the chair in which our dear friend Rogers has been sitting." The nearest did as their host had requested, and drew forth a manu- script poem of Byron's. "Ask Hunt to read it," said the noble "Childe." Leigh Hunt took the paper, and read aloud to the astonished circle the verses alluded to. When Leigh Hunt had finished, he handed the poem back to their host, and instinctively lifting the cushion from his own chair, looked to see if he, as well as Rogers, had been sitting on a manuscript barrel of gunpowder all the evening. Byron laughed heartily at the Bard of Rimini's suspicious move, and advised his other guests to do the same. :He then said, with a most genial, air: "If our dear friend Rogers knew what he had been sitting upon, he would not have relished his dinner so heartily."  We only remember a few of the lines, but the whole poem can be found in Fraser's Magazine for (we think) the year 18838. It commences with "Nose and chin to form a knocker Wrinkles that would puzzle Cocker; With an eye whose spectral light Would frighten goblins in the night; Face sepulchral-just as tho' ' He'd been galvanized to go.  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7492-00000172"/> 880           OHT-OHAT. While his mouth, a noisome hole, As though the man had swallowed whole, That leprous, loathsome mass--his soul."' After about a hundred lines of kindred nAmiability, the amiable Byron says that "His heart in vice is deeply sodden, Form, that the Devil would take to frighten God in." In the course of this Christian diatribe, Byron says, that if he is asked who this singular vampyre is, "My reply is shorter-franker- He's the Bard, the Beau, the Banker." We do not see why the editors of Byron should omit these lines-from his collected works; for however much their unchristian spirit may be deprecated, their power cannot be disputed-and were this objection to apply, half of the great poet's writings would be expunged. We conclude this little sketch with some of the more genial sayings of the departed poet. Sir Thomas Lawrence and Mr. Phillips have both very great merits as painters of female portraits When Rogers was asked to distinguish their different excellences, he replied, "Phillips shall paint my wife, and Lawrence my mistress." Of the late Lord Holland, whose face was full of sunshine, he observed most happily, "Lord Holland always comes down to breakfast like a man on whom some sudden good fortune has just fallen." On another occasion he exclaimed, alluding to some nobleman- "His was the smile that spoke the mind at ease,"-- a line, I believe, of his own composing, though not included in his works. "I envy no man of my time any saying so much as I envy Lord John Russell that admirable definition of a proverb- The wisdom of many and, the wit of one.'" "Lady Holland was always lamenting that she had nothing to do- that she did not know what to be at, or how to employ her time. She was one day worse on this subject than ever, and I could not resist re- commending her to 'try a  novelty-try and do a little good. " Of Sydney Smith, he observed--"Whenever the conversation is get- ting dull he throws in some touch which makes it rebound and rise again as light as ever.

"I was pleased with what I saw you about this morning," he observed once at Broadstairs to an artist, who naturally expected from such a commencement some reference to the labors of his pencil; "I was greatly pleased; I saw you brushing your coat. A gentleman who can brush his own coat is very independent." i"Whenever Lady Holland hears that a person of any consequence has said an ill word of her, she immediately invites him to dinner." "Lord Holland came to Lord Lansdowne, a short time before his death, and showed him the epitaph he had written on himself It ran in this way: ' Here lies Henry Vassall Fox, Lord Holland '-with all his titles--' who was drowned sitting in his elbow chair.' This was in some degree true; he died of water in the chest." "There is a couplet in Cowper which I admire exceedingly- 'Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much, Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. When I am at Fine Arts Commissions, where good paper and pens abound, I copy out these lines for the people who trouble me for my autograph- Oh, if the selfish knew how much they lost, What would they not endeavour, not endure, To imitate, so far as in them lay, Him who his wisdom and his power employs In making others happy.' 'How much he improves,' was the remark of one who mistook them for mine." "I was observing one day to Sydney Smith that I should not sit again for my portrait unless I was taken in an attitude of prayer. 'Yes,' said Sydney, who was even readier than Luttrell, ' yes, with your face in your hat.'"  The biographical sketch of, the poet Rogers, in the London Times, was written some five years since, in anticipation of his death, then ex- pected. His biographer has been three years in the grave I The per- sonal property of Mr. Rogers was about 25,000.  The pictures and books are possibly worth 40,000.  In his latter years, Rogers lived on an annuity from the bank in which he was a partner. J  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7492-00000173"/> 882           OHT-OCHAT.

GABBCK AND THE MASTIFF. ONE very sultry evening in the dog-days, Garrick performed the part of Lear. In the four first acts he received the accustomed tribute of applause; at the conclusion of the fifth, when he wept over the body of Cordelia, every eye caught the soft infection. At this interesting moment, to the astonishment of all present, his face assumed a new character, and his whole frame appeared agitated by a new passion; it was not tragic; it was evidently an endeavor to suppress a laugh. In a few seconds the attendant nobles appeared to be affected in the same manner, and the beauteous Cordelia, who was lying extended on a crimson couch, opening her eyes to see what occasioned the interrup- tion, leaped from her sofa, and with the majesty of England, the gallant Albany, and tough old Kent, ran laughing off the stage. The audience could not account for this strange termination of a tragedy in any other way than by supposing that the dramatis personae were seized with a sud- den frenzy; but their risibility had a different source. A fat Whitechapel butcher seated on the centre ofthe front bench of the pit, was accompanied by his mastiff, who being accustomed to sit on the same seat with his mas- ter at home, naturally supposed that he might here enjoy the like privilege: the butcher sat very far back, and the dog finding a fair opening, got on the seat, and fixing his fore paws on the rail of the orchestra, peered at the performers with as upright a head and as grave an air as the most sagacious critic of the day. Our corpulent slaughter- man was made of melting stuff, and not being accustomed to the heat of a play-house, found himself oppressed by a large and well powdered Sunday periwig, which, for the gratification of cooling and wiping his head, he pulled off and placed on the head of the mastiff. The dog being in so conspicuous a situation, caught the eye of Mr. Garrick and the other performers. A mastiff in a churchwarden's wig was too much-- it would have provoked laughter in Lear himself, at the moment of his deepest distress: no wonder then- that it had such an effect on his representative.

"Go ahead if you burst your boiler!" is the motto of every age-and he succeeds the best in every line of business who has the most of " do or die" in him. Strive, boys, to catch the spirit of the times; be up and dressed always, not gaping and rubbing your eyes as if you were half asleep; but be wide awake for whatever may turn up, and you will be somebody be- fore you die. Think, plan, reflect as much as you please before you act, but think quickly and closely, and when you have fixed your eye upon an object, spring to the mark at once. But above all things be honest. If you intend to be an artist, carve it in the wood, chisel it in the marble-if a merchant, write it in your ledger. Let honesty of purpose be your guardian star.

AccOrDING to the French journalists, the passion for gambling has reached almost the same heights as when, under the Regent, so many were ruined by this profligate practice; and it has extended its domi- nion over that sex who should be least subject to its influence, because its exhibition in woman seems to be so disgusting and so thoroughly opposed to all the gentle and delicate attributes which give her her peculiar charm. If we may believe accounts which are said to be drawn from the most authentic sources, a very effective lesson has lately been taught by a husband to a wife who was busily engaged in the satisfactory employment of ruining her husband's estate by enormously high play. M. X., the son of a general of the empire, left with the title of baron and a handsome fortune, had married a young and charming wife. After three or four years of happy wedded life, Mdme. la baronne X., who' had hitherto exhibited a gentle disposition, clouded by scarcely a single fault, changed all at, once: her humor became fitful, and quiet pleasures possessed no charm for her. Arrived at the prime of her youthful years, at a period when all the powers fully develope them- selves, a restless and ardent disposition manifested itself; she betrayed an undue fondness for admiration, and a passion for play displayed itself in her character with a violence not often met with. The husband suf- fered and trembled in silence. Mdme. X. had already lost large sums of money, and had sold her diamonds and replaced them with false brilliants. Great was the perplexity of the poor husband, when a lucky inspiration or a happy suggestion of a friend came to his aid. Amongst the elegant saloons of the world of fashion devoted to the worship of cards, there was one more dangerous than all the rest, where the play was ruinously high, and the company anything but select. M. X. con- sented to be presented, and, in company with his wife, walked reso- lutely into this abyss. Madame hastened to secure a seat at the table where the largest pile of gold was glittering; immediately, as she took her place, a gentleman of respectable age and appearance, carrying at his button-hole a ribbon of many-colored stripes, seated himself opposite to her. - At the first turn of the cards this adversary won twenty-five louis, and soon the loss of the gambling beauty amounted to twenty-five thousand francs. "Double or quits!" said the respectable gentleman. "Done," said she, endeavoring to look unconcerned. Again she lost. "Double or quits 1"This refrain, and the same unlucky result, were  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7492-00000177"/> 840           HT-OHAT, several times repeated. At first frightened, Madame X. next thought that she was playing with a gallant adversary, who, from motives of generosity, was-playing until the luck should turn in her favor. But when the debt amounted to one hundred thousand crowns, the gentle- man declined playing any longer, under plea of sudden illness, and rising, said: "We will stop here, if you please, madame; I believe you owe me just three hundred thousand francs." There was a sensation produced among the crowd by this announce- ment, and madame retired with despair in her heart.- For the first time she feared her husband. Still, the terrible avowal must be made, and she made it, pale, trembling, and on her knees. "Rise, my dear," said the husband, in a sad but kind voice. "The evil is done-all that is left is to pay the debt; it is true we shall be nearly ruined, but our honor will be safe." The adversary soon made his appearance, and was accompanied to the notary's office by M. X., who, on his return, said to his wife, "There is left us now only my small farm in Auvergne; I can be well content there, but you will find it a dull abode, and that is my only grief." Touched by so much kindness, Mdme. X. left Paris without a regret for its ruinous pleasures After so many stormy emotions, her soul found the rest in the country calm and sweet, and she soon acquired a love for its tranquil pleasures, and was perfectly happy. They lived there ten years, "Those were the happiest years of my life," said Mdme. X, " and no- thing ever gave me trouble except the thought that I had caused you to pay so dearly for them." "Console yourself, my dear," said her husband, " our savings would more than pay your loss, but you really lost nothing, and our fortune is doubled The gentleman who played with you'was one of those re- spectable persons who can always win if they please-and he played for the husband!"  THE "MERICAN ALADDIN. G. W. CtUmns is responsible for the following exceedingly clever sketch :  - When we go out on Saturday afternoon to moralize and see new houses, we usually fake our young ones by Aladdin's palace. Aladdin was a Yankee. He started life by swapping jack-knives, then putting   aOIT-OHAT.             841 the halves of broken marbles together and passing them off for whole ones. When he gathered some brass, he went to school all the summer to learn the golden arithmetic--addition to himself, and subtraction from his neighbor. At an early age Aladdin was considered to be good at a bargain- which meant that he could always succeed in changing a worse for the better-always keeping the blind side of a horse to the wall when he had to sell it; and the village said that certainly Aladdin would suc- ceed. When he left, "he will be rich" said the village, with more approval than it would say " he would be generous and true." To Alad- din the world was but a market, in which to buy cheap and sell dear. For him there was no beauty, no history, no piety, no heroism. Vainly the stars shone over him; vainly the south wind blew. In the wake of the great ship Argo, in which Jason and his companions sailed for the Golden Fleece, over the gleaming Mediterranean-where the ships of Tyre, Rome,and the Crusaders have been before him-through the Pil- lars of Hercules, through which Columbus sailed to find fame in a new world--now sails Aladdin to find fortune. To him all lands are alike. No Homer sang for him in the Egean; he only curses the wind that will not blow him into Odessa. No syrens sing for him, but he loves the huge oath of the lively boatswain. With the Bible in his hand and a quid of tobacco in his mouth, he goes about the holy places in Jerusalem and " calculates" their exact site. He sees the land of the Rameses and Ptolemies; and the reverent echoes of the Lybian desert, whose echoes have slumbered since they were tramped over by Alexander's army, are now awakened by the shrill whistle of Old Dan Tucker. He insults the Grand Titnma, hobnobs with the Grand Mogul, turns his back upon emperors, and takes a pinch out of the Pope's snuff-box. He chews with the Arabs, smokes opium with the Turks, and rides for a bride with the Calmuck Tartars. Aladdin comes home again, and the admiring village points him out to the younger generation as a successful mian.: "My son" does see, and beholds him owning a million of dollars-of all societies of which he is not president, a director. Hies name is as good as gold--he has bought pictures and statues-he has also bought a Mrs. Aladdin and housed her in luxury; but he picks his mouth with a silver fork. He has a home for a poet, but he makes it his boast that he reads nothing but his news- papers. He goes to church twice on Sundays, and only wakes up when the preacher denounces the sinner of Sodom. and Gomorrah, and those  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7492-00000178"/> 342           O H I T- O H A T. "tough old Jews" of Jerusalem. His head is bald and shiny with the sermons which hit it and glanced off. He clasps his hands in prayer, but forgets to -open them when the poor-box is passed around; and he goes home like a successful man, thanking God that he is not as other men are. And after dinner he sits before the fire in his easy chair, lights a cigar, and looks languidly at Mrs. Aladdin through the thick smoke. By and by, old Aladdin dies. The conventional virtues are told over as the mourning carriages are called out. The papers regret they are called upon to deplore the loss of a revered parent, generous friend, public-spirited citizen, and pious man; and the precocious swapper of jackknives, and the model set up to the young generation, is laid in the dust. Above his grave the stars he never saw now burn with a soft lustre, which no lamp about a king's tomb can emulate; and the south wind, for whose breath upon his brow he was never grateful, strews his ,lonely last bed with anemones and violets that his heel crushed when living; and we who are to be formed upon that model, carelessly re. mark, as we stir our toddies; "So old Aladdin is gone at last; and, by the way, how much did he leave!" Tahna and Bonaparte.-Talma had, in early life, been intimate with Bonaparte; and the ex-Emperor (who never forgot the friends of the young engineer officer) accorded the petites-entrees of the palace to the sovereign of the The'atre FranVais. Talma saw him constantly; not, however, to give him lessons, an invention at which Bonaparte and Talma both laughed - but to discuss his favorite topic, tragedy, of which he was passionately fond. On this subject, however, the actor frequently differed with the emperor; while the emperor as frequently dictated to the actor, greeting him with, "Eh bien Talma, vous n'avez pas soin de vos moyens hier au soir." Napoleon always disputed the merits of comedy, and observed to a gentleman, from whom I had the anecdote, "Si vous preferez la comedie, c'est parceque vous vieillissez." -"Et vous, Sire," replied Monsieur  , "vous aimez la trag6die parceque vous ftes trop jeune."

One morning, coming from re- hearsal, she called in at a shop, to purchase some article of -dress Wholly absorbed in the part she was to perform, whilst the shopman was displaying his muslins, &amp;c., Mrs. Siddons took one in her hand, and fixing her eyes full on the man, exclaimed in a solemn voice, "Said ye, sir, this would wash!"The poor fellow, in great alarm, began to think the intellects of his customer were not right; but Mrs. Siddons, recalled to recollection by his astonishment, with a smile, apologized for her absence of mind, and repeated the question in a voice better suited to the occasion. Blue Beard.-As this extraordinary personage has long been the themeonot only of children's early study and terror, and as no afterpiece had ever a greater run than that splendid and popular musical enter- tainment, our readers will, I have no doubt, be gratified in perusing the character of that being who really existed, and who was distinguished, in horror and derision, by the strange appellation of a"Blue Beard." He was the famous Gilles, Marquise de Laval, a marshal of France, and a general of uncommon intrepidity, and greatly distinguished himself in the reigns of Charles VI. and VII. by his courage, particularly against the English, when they invaded France.   He rendered those services to his country which were. sufficient to immortalize his name, had he not for ever tarnished his glory by the most horrible and cruel murders, blasphemies, and licentiousness of every kind. His revenues were princely; but his prodigality was sufficient to render even an emperor a bankrupt. Wherever he went, hte had in his suite a seraglio, a band of players, a company of musicians, a society of sorcerers and magicians,  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7492-00000179"/> 844           OHT-oHAT. an almost incredible number of cooks, packs of dogs of various kindsr and above 200 led horses. Mezerai, an author of great repute, says, that he " encouraged and maintained men, who called themselves sor- cerers, to discover hidden treasures, and corrupted young persons of both sexes to attach themselves to him, and afterwards killed them for the sake of their blood, which was requisite to form his charms and incantations." These horrid excesses may be believed when we reflect on the age of ignorance andbarbarism in which they were certainly too often practised He was at length, for a state crime against the Duke of Brittany, sen- tenced to be burnt, alive in a field at Nantz, in 1440; but the Duke of Brittany, who was present at his execution, so far mitigated the sen- tence, that he was first strangled, then burnt, and his ashes buried. Though he was descended from one of the most illustrious families in France, he declared previous to his death that all his horrible excesses were owing to his wretched education. BOISSY. BomISSY, the author of several dramatic pieces that were received with applause, met the common fate of those who give themselves up en- tirely to the arts of the Muses. He labored and toiled unremittingly-- his works procured him fame, but no bread. He languished, with a wife and child, under the pressure of the extremest poverty. But melancholy as his situation wast he lost nothing of that pride which is peculiar to genius, whether great or small; he could not creep and fawn at the feet of a patron. He had friends who would have administered relief to him; but they were never made acquainted with his real con- dition, or had not friendly impetuosity enough to force their assistance upon him. Boissy became a prey to distress and despondency. The shortest way to rid himself at once from all his misery seemed to him to be death. Death appeared to him as a friend, as a savior, and deliverer, and gained his affection. His tender spouse, who was no less weary of life, listened with participation when he declaimed with all the warmth of poetic rapture, of deliverance from this earthly prison, and of the smiling prospect of futurity; and at length resolved to accompany him in death. But she could not bear to think of'leaving her beloved son, of five years old, in a world of misery and sorrow : it was therefore agreed to take the child along with them on their passage into another and a better. They were now firmly resolved to die. But what mode of death   CHT-CHAT.             845 should they adoptI They made choice of the most horrible-of starv- ing: accordingly they waited, in their solitary and deserted apartment, their dear deliverer, death, in his most ghastly form.-Their resolution and their fortitude were immovable. They locked the door and began to fast. When any one came and knocked, they fled trembling into the corner, and were in perpetual dread lest their purpose should be dis- covered. Their little son, who had not yet learned to silence the calls of hunger -by artificial reasons, whispering and crying, asked for bread, but they always found means to quiet him. It occurred to one of Boissy's friends, that iftwas very extraordinary he should never find him at home. At first, he thought the family were removed; but, on being assured of the contrary, he grew more uneasy. He called several times in one day; always nobody at homel At last he burst open the -door, -Oh, what a sight I He saw his friend, with his wife and son, lying on ' a bed, pale and emaciated, scarcely able to utter a sound. The boy lay in the middle, and the husband and the wife had their arms thrown over him. The child stretched out his little hands towards his deliverer, and his first word was-bread I It was now the third day that not a morsel of food had entered his lips  The parents lay still in a perfect stupor; they had never heard the bursting open of the door, and felt nothing of the embraces of their agitated friend. Their wasted eyes were directed towards the boy, and the tenderest expressions of pity were in the look with which they had last beheld him, and still saw him dying. Their friend hastened to take measures for their deliverance; but could not succeed without difficulty. They thought they had already done with all the troubles of the world, and were suddenly terrified at being forced into them again I Void of sense and reflection, they submitted to the attempts that were made to restore them to life. At length their friend hit upon the most efficacious means. He took the child from their arms, and thus called up the -last spark of paternal and maternal tenderness. He gave the child food, who with one hand held his bread, and with the other alternately shook his father and mother; his piteous moans roused them at length from their death-like slumber. It seemed at once to awaken a new love of life in their hearts, when they saw that their child had left the bed and their embraces. Nature did her office. Their friend procured them strengthening broths, which he put in their lips with the utmost caution, and did not leave them till every symptom of restored life was fully visible,  Thus were they saved. This transaction made much noise in Paris, and at length reached the 15^  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7492-00000180"/> B46           ( aHT-c I AT. ears of the Marchioness de Pompadour. Boissy's deplorable situation moved her. She immediately sent -him a hundred louis d'ors, and soon after procured him the profitable place of controlleur de Mercure de France, with a pension for his wife and child, if they outlived him. "LADY COOK," said Smith, " was once so moved by a charity sermon, that she begged me to lend her a guinea for her contribution. I did so; she never repaid me, but spent it on herself." AT one time, when I gave a dinner, I used to have candles placed all round the dining-room, and high up, in order to show off the pictures. I asked Smith how he liked that plan "Not at all," he replied, " above there is a blaze of light, and below nothing but darkness and gnashing of teeth." SPEAKING to me of Bonaparte, the Duke of Wellington remarked, that in one respect he was superior to all the generals who had ever ex- isted. "Was it," I asked, " in the management and skilful arrangement of his troops?" "No," answered the Duke; " it was in his power of con- centrating such vast masses of men--a most important point in the art of war."                   -  "I have found," said the Duke, "that raw troops, however inferior to the old 'ones in manoeuvring, are far superior to them in downright hard fighting with the enemy; at Waterloo, the young ensigns and lieutenants, who had never before seen a battle, rushed to meet death as if they had been playing at cricket."

PROGRESS, innovation, improvement, are the watchwords of the day. Mr. Peripper Peeps has a thing or two in his head, and, as he says, it is bound to come out. So it is. His first eruption upon a startled world is to be in the dramatic line of authorship. "What kind of plays are yours to be?" asked a friend. "Oh, great, great. Nothing like 'em going now, I assure you. It is to be all consisting of expressive dumb show." "Dumb show; what, pantomime?" "No, no. That's old. My idea is new. I can only give you an idea by a case in point. For instance-curtain rises-we will call the play the ' Bloody Courtship, or the Fatal Snuffers.' First scene brings on- it is rural-a churn, moved across the stage by unseen machinery." "A milk-churn!" "Yes. Churn stops in the middle of the stage-pauses a few moments as if waiting for somebody, and then moves its handle up and down rapidly, as if very impatient for the arrival of some one. Then moves off slowly." "What does that mean?" "The audience are to trust to imagination to explain every scene. The churn is to represent a milk-maid in love. The moving of the han- dle her anguish at her not meeting her lover, whom she expected. The slow exit signifies her belief that she is deserted." "It will be a great compliment to the audience, to think they have imagination enough to understand that." "Certainly, and that will insure their approbation." "Who is the churn's lover?" "A farmer's man-Hodge, the ploughman. Enter plough-that's Hodge-advances to centre of stage where churn stood, drops some soil, and then retires up the stage." "What does that mean?" "The soil is a letter which he leaves for the milk-maid, declaring that the match is broken, and he no longer loves her." "And is that so?" s No, he only intends to try her. He is on the watch to see if she will mourn his departure. Enter churn sees the soil-hastens to it- whirls round and falls." "What is that for?"  "The milk-maid has read the letter and fainted at the supposed trea-  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7492-00000181"/> 848          CnI T- n A T. chery. Plough now advances, drops more soil-sand, this time-churn wriggles a little-gets up-and then goes between the plough-handles."' "And that means----" "That Hodge has brought her to, with a pinch of snuff-that's the sand-aand the handles represent an embrace of reconciliation and con- fiding love." "Buf why do you call it the' Bloody Courtship,' and so forth i" "' Bloody Courtship and Fatal Snuffers, "I said. "That's easily ex- plained. Hodge is a snuffer, else he wouldn't have snuff about him, and she is a snuffer, else it wouldn't have been in her nose. When they embrace, a sound of sneezing is heard, and at that instant' some blood falls upon the stage. The sneezing is to make the idea of snuff more plain; and blood means that the shock of joy has broken a blood-vessel in the churn. After the embrace, the churn falls again-' that means the milk-maid's dead, and now comes the great triumph of the whole. The plough keels over--that means remorse-and suddenly the stage is lit up with red and blue fire and a pair of mammoth snuffers, wide open and as big as a derrick, come slowly down, from Heaven-representing the shears of revengeful Fate-and seizing the plough, descend through the stage-meaning that Hodge is taken to the place of punishment, for trifling-with the affections of the churn-and the churn is drawn up through the ' flies' --meaning, of course, that the broken-hearted milk- maid has gone to Heaven. What do you think of it " "Splendid idea-if the style can be understood. But isn't this some- thing like Lord Burleigh's nod, in Sheridan's play of he Critile " "It does proceed upon that idea-only immensely enlarged and im- proved upon, you see. It was a spark of genius in Sheridan In me it is a whole 'conflagration." ANECDOTES OF CHDREN. THE best trait about Knickerbocker Clark is his love for children. That covers a " multitude of virtues" in our eyes. We take a page from his most excellent magazine. The anecdote of the late Daniel Webster, the expounder, is very characteristic. "Talking of children, reminds me of another childish anecdote, which I have lately heard in these New England 'parts.' You no doubt know what a Yankee ' muster' was in the olden time.

Their father met them, and, addressing the first, said:-- "' Well, DAN, what have you done with your money V' "' Spent it I' was the sturdy reply "' And what have you done with yours, ZE tE' "' Lent it to DAN I' "A little boy, blind from birth, aged about four years, died in this village a few days ago, with scarlatina. About an hour before the lit- tle sufferer departed, he exclaimed: "' Pa! I see now! Darkness is all gone! Day is come P' "His father inferred from the incident that he was better,and would probably recover. But an hour passed, and he was with the angels. "LrrrTLE EDDY, on his way to school, frequently loitered by a small stream which he was' obliged to pass, to witness the gambols of his play- mates while bathing; the water being of sufficient depth in some places for that purpose. Fearing some accident might befal him, his mother had told him never to venture near, and in strong terms, not to go into the water. One day, however, being overcome by temptation, and the urgent solicitations of boys older than himself, he yielded to their im- portunities and his own wishes; and for an hour entered into their aquatic sports right heartily. But as ill luck would have it, while dressing himself, by some mismanagement, he put on his little shirt wrong-side out, entirely unnoticed by him at the time: but the quick eye of his mother saw it, and divined the reason at once.. Before retir- ing for the night, it was customary for the little boy to kneel by her side and repeat his little prayer. While on his knees, she took the op- portunity to reprove him for disobeying her commands.

However, the satisfactory explanation, as he thought, soon occurred.

They have marked the manners of the crocodile, as the torero has studied the manners of the bull. When ::    they are assailed they put in practice with that presence of mind and that resignation which characterize the Indians, the Zamboes, and copper- colored men in general, the counsels they have heard from their infancy. In countries where nature is so powerful and so terrible, man is constant- i     ly prepared for danger. We have mentioned before the answer of the young Indian girl, who delivered herself from the jaws of the crocodile:-- "I knew he would let me go, if I thrust my fingers into his eyes." This girl belonged to the indigent class of the people, in whom the habits of physical want augment energy of character; but how can we avoid being surprised to observe, in the countries convulsed by terrible earthquakes, on the table-land of the province of Quito, women belong- ing to the highest classes of society display, in the moment of peril, the same calm, the same reflecting intrepidity I I shall mention one exam- ple only, in support of this assertion. Onu the 4th of February, 1797, when 35,000 Indians perished in the space of a few minutes, a young mother saved herself and children, crying out to them to extend their arms at the moment when the cracked ground was ready to swallow them up. When this courageous woman- heard the astonishment that was expressed at a presence of mind so extraordinary, she answered, with great! simplicity: "I had been told in my infancy, if the earth- quake surprise you in a house, place yourself under a doorway that communicates from one apartment to another; if you be in the open air, and feel the ground opening beneath you, extend both your arms, and try to support yourself on the edge of the crevice.7' Thus, in savage regions, or in countries exposed to frequent convul- sions, man is prepared to struggle with the beasts of the forest, to deliver himself from the jaws of the crocodile, and to escape from the conflict of the elements. A   ysiouIAN, passing by a grave-stone cutter's shop, called out,- "Good morning, neighbor; hard at work, I see. You finish your grave-stones as far as ' In memory of,' and then wait, I suppose, to see who wants a monument next." "Why, yes," replied the old joker, " unless somebody's sick, and you are doctoring 'em, then I keep right on." ^ '   CHT-OHAT.             861 FIouncing.-In Guernsey, when a young man offers himself to a young lady, and is accepted, the parents of the parties give what is termed a flouncing; that is/they invite their friends to a feast, the young lady is led round the room by her future father-in-law, and introduced to his friends, and afterwards the young man is paraded round in like Pmanner by his future father-in-law; there is then an exchange of rings, and some articles of plate, according to the rank of the parties. After this it is horrid for the damsel to be seen walking with any other male person, and the youth must scarce glance at anything feminine; in this way they court for years. After this ceremony, if the gentleman alters his mind, the lady can claim half his property; and if the fickle lass should repent, the gentleman can demand half of hers.  The natives of Guernsey keep themselves very secluded; they have three classes of society--the sixties, the forties, and the twenties. The Cost of Oleanliness.-We drove into Chambery, the capital of ancient Savoy, about 9 A. M. We were allowed twenty-five minutes for breakfast, which would have been very well, but that the time required for cooking most of the breakfast had to come out of it. There was enough and good enough to eat, and (as usual throughout all this re- gion) wine" in abundance without charge, but tea, coffee, or chocolate, must be ordered and paid for extra. Even so, I was unable to obtain a cup of chocolate, the excuse being that there was no time to make it. I did not understand, therefore, why I was charged more than others for breakfast, but to talk English against French or Italian, is to get a mile behind in no time, so I pocketed the change offered me, and came away. On the coach, however, with an Englishman near me, who had travel- led this way before, and spoke French and Italian, I ventured to expose my ignorance as follows:- "Neighbor, why was I charged three francs for breakfast, and the rest of you but two and a half " "Don't know-perhaps you had tea or coffee." "No, sir-don't drink either." "Then,. perhaps, you washed your face and hands!" "Well, it would be just like me." "O, then, that's it 1 The half franc was for the basin and toweL" "Ah, oui, out."

A Dog Story.-A gentleman, residing in Chelsea, owns an English terrier, who has a:remarkably intelligent face, but is otherwise undis. tinguishable from the " common order" of dogs. The gentleman visited Somerville a short time since, and the dog accompanied him. There the dog made the acquaintance of another dog, and was so fascinated with the sociability of his new companion that he missed the cars, and his master came away-without him. But the dog was at the station early the next morni.;'g, and came home in the first train of cars. Since that time, the gentleman noticed that his dog was absent about once a week, during the entire day, and has discovered the fact that on these occa- sions he goes direct to the Lowell depot, takes his place in the passen- ger cars, jumps out at Somerville, spending the day with his canine friend, and returns at night.  The same dog will, if his master leaves home without him, run down to the coach-office, jump into the omnibus, and come down to the city in search of him, and if he does not succeed in finding him, returns by the same conveyance.  He appears to- prefer the omnibus to the ferry-boat, and his fidelity insures him " a free pas- sage." A  Man of Bones.-Here is a curious fact for. you. The flesh of a liv- ing man once grew into bone. It seems hard to believe, but I suppose it was so;, for, in the Museum at Dublin, Ireland, there is, or was, the skeleton of one Clerk, a native of the city of Cork, whom they call the Ossified Mian, one of the greatest curiosities of nature. It is the carcass of a  man entirely ossified in his lifetime, living in that condition for several years  Those who knew him before this surprising alteration, affirm that he had been a man of great strength and agility. He felt the first symptoms of this surprising change some time after a debauch. till, by slow degrees, every part grew into a bony substance, except his skin, eyes, and intestines; his joints settled in such la manner that no ligament had its proper operation; he could not lie down or rise up without assistance.  He  had at last no bend in his body, yet when he was placed upright, like a statue of stone, he could stand, but could not move, in the least. His teeth were joined, and formed into one entire bone; therefore a hole was broken through them to convey liquid sub- stance for his nourishment. The tongue lost its use, and his sight left him, some time before he expired.

It is this:-When an error has arisen from any transposition of figures, the difference between such transpos- ed number of figures is uniformly a multiple of the numeral nine. For instance, suppose an error occurs in bringing out a trial balance or cash settlement of the amount in question, or that the sum short or over can be divided by nine without any remainder, there is a strong probability that the mistake has been made by transposing figures; at any rate, if such mistake takes place by reason of transposition, the sum. in question will divide by nine without remainder. To illustrate this further: If 97 has been put down 19, the error will be 18, or twice 9 exactly; if 322 be set down 223, the error will be 99, or eleven times 9, and so on between any transposed numbers. This class of errors is veryv common. Get Homes.-Get a home, rich or poor, get a home, and learn to love that home and make it happy to the wife and children by your beaming presence; learn to love simple pleasures, flowers of God's own planting; and music of his own; the bird, the wind, the waterfall. So shall you help to stem the tide of desolation, poverty, and despair, that comes upon so many through scorn of little things. Oh, the charm of a little home; comfort dwells there that shuns the gilded halls of revelry. IT is told of Charles X., that after his abdication he endeavored, for amusement, to make two watches go exactly alike. Failing after nu- merous attempts, he exclaimed, "Behold, not even two watches can I bring to agree with each other, and yet, fool that I was, I thought that I should be able to govern, like the works of a watch, so many nations, all living under different skies, in-different climes, and speaking differ- eint languages."

Blundering Actor.-An actor in Ireland, who was never trusted with more than a message, on account of the extreme propensity he had to drinking, was one day at a public-house enjoying himself, when the prompter's boy brought him a part, written as follows:--" Act L Scene II. at Behold he comes,--go -on to King, P. S., shake head, and come off." The actor thought he certainly could do that, although he should be never so drunk, as there was nothing to say. He attended at the side -heard his cue-then ran on the stage to the king--caught him by the collar-shook the king's head until his hat and wig fell off, and then retired. The actor following could not smother his laughter. The prompter abused him for his error; but he contended he was right, according to the words of the part;--"for," said he, "as it only expressed shake head, I surely had a right to my choice, which head I should make use off" School for Scandal-When the School for Scandal was performing at Drury-lane theatre, with uncommon applause, the first season, C-d sat in the stage-box, and was observed never to smile at any of the good things which the author had put into the mouths of the scenic personages.

As there are social traitors in every circle, this sarcasm was conveyed to Sheridan, who very coolly observed, "that C-d was truly ungrateful for not smiling at his comedy as he had seen a tragedy of C-cd's at Covent-garden theatre, but a fortnight before and had laughed from the beginning to the end I" A damsel in Ayrshire, having two lovers, and not knowing which to prefer, settled the matter by marrying one and immediately eloping with the other.

Foote, ever ready to oblige his guests, ordered the fishing apparatus to be got ready, and a chair to be placed at the pond side for the accommodation of the learned sportsman. Two hours did the Baron throw the line with as much patience as he could: at length Foote and his company came out; "Well, Baron, do they bite!" ' No, I have only  had a nibble or two." By G-,d, you have not," says Foote. "What do you mean 7" says his lordship. 'l I mean that there is not a fish in the pond, for the water was only put in yesterday.' Lord Chesterfield and Foote.-Lord Chesterfield, in a very sickly state, was taking the air in Hyde-park one morning, when Foote rode up to inquire after his lordship's health. "Well, Sam," says the witty earl, "what part do you play to-night " "Lady Dowager Whitfield,"' replied the wag. "I am going to cut a figure myself," said his lordship. ] "You have long cut a splendid figure, my lord," says Foote. "It may be so," says his lordship with a smile, "but I am now rehearsing the principal part in the Funeral." AN old man and his son, neither of them very well informed as to the railroads and their uses, chanced one day to be at work in a field near a railroad track. Railroads were a novel " institution" to them; and when a train of cars shot by, a thought was suggested to the lad, who said to his parent-"Dad, why don't you take a ride in the cars some day'" - "Take a ride in the cars T why, I haint got time, my son."

I rAVE often noticed in prisoners a desire to sleep while laboring uni deep affliction. The condemned, the night before execution, are ve apt to sleep soundly, if left alone. I have seen men enter a prison c for the first time, pale and trembling with fear, or weeping with terr and soon after fall asleep. The propensity to sleep under difficulties not always the result of grief and sorrow.   The serenity of mind p: duced by philosophy or religion may sometimes enable men, under t most trying  circumstances, to lose themselves in sleep.  -Profess Webster, of  Boston, while in prison, appeared to  be cheerful a happy.  He  desired his family, when they visited him, to be as cheerf lively as possible, and they were so.

At this time one of the lords of the council came to the castle with a message, and demanded admittance to the earl; It was announced that the earl was asleep. The privy councillor thought that this was a subterfuge, and insist- ed on entering. The door of the cell was softly opened, a;d there lay Argyle on the bed, sleeping in his irons the placid sleep of infancy. The conscience of the renegade smote him. He turned away sick at heart, ran out of the castle, and took refuge in the dwelling of a lady of his family, who lived hard by.. There he flung himself on a couch and gave himself up to an agony of remorse and shame. His kins- woman, alarmed by his looks and groans, thought he had been taken with some illness, and begged him to drink a cup of sack. "I No, no'" he said, " that will do me no good." She prayed him to tell her what had disturbed him. "I have been," said he, "in Argyle's prison; I have seen him within an hour of eternity, sleeping as sweetly as ever man slept.

"Why, he married a squaw lady of fashion and turned Hingian, which event was noted in all the papers of that time."  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7492-00000187"/> 860           COHT-OHAT. PROBLEM.

To any one who believes in taking things easy, early rising is a great bore. You are never in such a delightful state of composure, as when lying just near enough awake to know the luxury of sleeping, and sufficiently asleep to be insensible to the cloggings of daily cares; Much better is this than rising before the sun these cold mornings, with one eye open, and putting off your patience as you put on your clothes. The snoozing mortal, who, on being informed that day was breaking, replied-", Let it break, it don't owe me anything," was a philosopher-- he had an eye to the enjoyments of lfe1 , and an enlarged soul capable of a snooze.

THE SOCIAL TYRANTS OF THE WORLD. THERE are small as well as great tyrants in the world. There are oppressors in social life, not less than in political. It is not only the subjects of the Czar or the vassals of the Russian king, who turn pale at a frown and tremble when the anger of their master is aroused. In thousands of domestic circles, even in this free and enlightened land, the hearts of women and children turn chill at the footsteps of hus- bands or fathers whose misgoverned passions, intense selfishness, or brutal character, make tyrannies of the hearth-stone of home. So common is this species of tyranny, indeed, that- many are guilty    C OHT-OHAT.            861 of it who would not only resent the imputation, but sincerely believe themselves innocent The. uncontrolled authority which the master of a household enjoys, naturally tends to foster habits of self-will and imperiousness. It needs not only the restraining influence of the strongest affection, both as, partner and as parent, but the constant remembrance of the old Greek's motto, "Know thyself," to avoid degene- rating in this respect; and where these are neglected, neither education, nor refinement, nor wealth, nor position, nor official authority, is always sufficient to avert family tyranny. In some of our most splendid man- sions, not less- than in dirty cellars, is domestic oppression to be found. The wife of the millionaire is often not less oppressed than the helpmate of the beggar. For it is not of physical tyranny that we speak, as much as of that which is keener and more subtle-of that which cuts to the soul-of that moral despotism which is exercised by harsh words, by cruel neglects, by unkind acts, by petty insults. Husbands go home and vent, upon unoffending wives, the irritation which the events of the day have pro- duced. Would they dare to vent it on their partners, clerks, or custom- ers who originated it? Fathers push innocent children angrily aside, or even strike them, because annoyed by their noise. Would they venture to lay hands on those who try their patience, a hundred times worse, in the constantly occurring vexatious occurrences of the dayf Too often the household is made to expiate all that the husband and ? father has had to endure abroad, till wife or children learn to watch for storm or sunshine on his face, with eager palpitating hearts. Too often the frown on the father's brow banishes the smile from the mother's lips, hushes the prattle of the little ones, and throws a gloom and con- straint ove6r the whole domestic circle. Oh! in how many homes, there reigns a silent, crushing tyranny of which the world knows nothing, which destroys everything like happiness there, and which pervades the moral atmosphere in which the children grow up, as miasma taints the air. Hypothetically, every man is willing to admit that tyranny, thus exercised over the innocent and 'helpless, is as cowardly as it is cruel l Hypothetically, all will acknowledge that, to be a tyrant at home, makes a man, so far forth, as much the oppressor, as to crush a Poland or Hungary, or to hertd slaves on the coast of Afica. But how few will concede, even to their own consciences, that they are themselves such despots! It is the curse of selfishness, more than of most other 16   &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7492-00000188"/> J!     862 -          CHT-HAT. vices, that it conceals the sin from the sinner, and that the worse the man becomes, the less apt is he to see his error. - There are tens of thousands of oppressed women and children, all the way from Maine to Texas, who have no one to speak for them, unless the hearts of the tyrants themselves could be softened. This, alas would be almost a miracle. FIRESIDE AMUSEMENTS. 1. Take a tumbler, and fill it nearly full of water. Then insert a lump of sugar in the water, and continue to stir it. In a few minutes thesugar becomes invisible. 2. Place a candlestickr, with a lighted candle in it, in the middle of a table. Mahogany is best, but deal will answer the purpose. Place an extinguisher upon the candle, and the apartment will be left in dark- ness, unless there are other lights in it. 3. Take a kitten (one of a kindly disposition is preferable), and place it in your lap. Stroke it gently for a few moments, and the animal will be distinctly heard to purr. This experiment may be varied by pinching its tail, in which case it will spit and jump down. 4. Let the cinders be thrown upon the fire, and then take a common hearth-broom, and carefully sweep every particle of ash and dust under the grate. Hang up the broom and sit down, and a pleasing display of tidiness will be made. 5. Take a pair of scissors-the size is immaterial. Obtain a piece of white or brown paper, six inches long, and a yard and a half across Snip it in two. You will find that no exertion of strength will enable you to join the several parts together again. 6. Place the palms of your hands together crosswise, and holding them pomewhat loosely, strike them on your knee. A sound will be produced somewhat resembling the chink of money. This is quite as good as having money itself, which only leads to outlay and extrava- gance. " I ImE to see the dear little creatures amusing themselves," said Mrs. Brown, when her elder boy took the vrisitor's new bonnet, and affixed it to the tail of his kite.

Amongst an uncommonly ugly medley, I spied the second clerk about one hun- dred and fifty feet above my own level. I recognised him at once; for ten minutes before I had been sucking a sherry-cobbler with him out of the same rummer. Well, I watched him. He came down through the roof of a shoemaker's shop, and landed on the floor close by the shoemaker, who was at work. The clerk being in a hurry, jumped up to go to the assistance of the other sufferers, when the 'man of wax demanded five hundred dollars for the damage done to the roof. ' Too high,' replied the clerk; ' never paid more than two hundred and fifty dollars in my. life, and l've done the same thing often 1"' A RHYME--AND A REASON; OR THE WAKEL ARRAH I why did you leave us, thin, Paddy, my joy.

FAMILY SECRETS. In Coles county, there lived a man named Isaac Dudson and his wife, who were firm believers in the prophecy of Father Miller; and not doubting for a moment the correctness of their prophet's calculations, they set about making active -preparations for the eventful day that was to terminate the existence of all- sublunary things  After having "set their house in order," the following conversation took place: HUSBAND.-My dear wife, I believe I have made every preparation for to-morrow. I have forgiven all my enemies, and prayed for the forgiveness of my sins, and I feel perfectly calm and resigned. WIE.--Well, husband, I believe I am ready for the sound of the trumpet. H.-I am rejoiced to hear it. But my dear wife, I have no doubt there are many little domestic secrets which have been kept hidden from each other, which, had they been known at the time of their occurrence, might have produced unpleasant feelings; but as we have but one day more to live, let us unbosom ourselves freely to each other. W.-Well, husband, you are right; there are some little things that I never told you, and which I intended should remain between me and my God; but as we have but one day left, I reckon it's right to make a clean breast to each other. I am ready; you begin, husband. H.-No, dear, you begin. W.-No; husband, you begin-I can't.  H.-No; you know, my love, Paul says husbands have a right to command their wives. It is your duty, too, as a Christian woman, to obey your husband, and, the father of your children. So begin, love. W.-In the sight of God, I reckon it's right; so I will tell you, dear husband, our oldest son, William, is not your child. H.--Great God! I Mary! I never dreamed of your being untrue to me I    Is that so I  W. (in tears)-Yes, Heaven forgive me, it is true. I know that I did very wrong, and am sorry for it; but in an evil hour I fell, and there is no help for it now. H.-William not mine I    In the name of God, whose child is he I W.-He's Mr. Graham's, the constable. The Lord be near your poor wife I H.-So then, Mary, William ain't my child?  Go on.

For a long time after the discovery of that island, many, people really believed that the leaves of a certain tree which flourishes there could walk about the ground. The story arose in this way: "Some English sailors landed upon the coast one day; after roaming about until they were tired, they sat down under a tree to rest themselves. A puff of wind came along, and blew off a shower of leaves, which, after turning over and over in the air, as leaves generally do, finally rested upon the ground. As it was midsummer, and everything appeared quite green, the circumstance puzzled the sailors considerably. But their surprise was much greater, as you may well suppose, when, after a short time, they saw-the leaves crawling along on the ground towards the trunk of the tree. They ran at once for the vessel, without stopping to examine into the matter, and. set sail away from the land, where everything seemed to be bewitched. One of the men said that he 'expected every moment to see the trees set to and dance a jig,' Subsequent explorations of Aus- tralia have taught us that these walking leaves are insects. They live upon the trees. Their bodies are very thin and flat, their wings form- ing large leaf-like organs.&amp; When, they area disturbed their legs are folded away under their bodies, leaving the shape exactly like a leaf with its stem and all complete. They are of a bright green colorlin  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7492-00000190"/> /866          O H IT - a &amp;tA T. summer, but they gradually change in the fall, with the leaves, to the brown of frost-bitten vegetation. When shaken from the tree they lie for a few minutes upon the ground, as though they were dead, but presently they begin to crawl along towards the tree, which they ascend again. They rarely use their wings, although they are pretty well supplied in this respect" N the beginning were armies--for, Milton tells us, legions of angels were engaged in the war with Satan. In the future, there will be armies, no doubt. At the present moment there are, we will not call them "soldiers," but militia-men. On a certain public celebration, at which one of these regiments  was reviewed, a  stumpy, plethoric, undersized Major, who unques- tionably was a minor in stature, put his men through a preliminary drill. They were tall-l-e was low. To exalt himself, he stood on a plateau or platform some eighteen inches from the ground. Even then  he was undersized. Immediately opposite (" right fornenst him," as Paddy has it), stood a grenadier, six feet four against the major's four feet six' "Eyes right," said the major. "Take the move- ment from  me," was the next command. The tall grenadier looked downr, to catch his major's eyeas "Stand at ease," cried the major. "Plase your honner," said the grenadier, who was a real Milesian, "that seems unpossible, It ain't in the nature of things, that I can bend my back to peep into your good-looking eyes, and ' stand at ease' in doing that same." The Major incontinently evaporated, and threw up his com- mission that very day. Odd Titles of Books in Former Times.-In 1686, a pamphlet was published in London, entitled "A most Delectable Sweet Perfumed Nosegay, for God's Saints to Smell at." About the year 1649, there was published a work entitled '"A Pair of Bellows to blow off the Dust cast   OUIT-O1AT.             867 upon John Fry'," and another, called "The Snuffers of Divine Love." Cromwell's time was particularly famous for title-pages. The author of a work on charity entitles his book "Hooks and Eyes for Believers' Breeches." Another, who wished to exalt human nature, calls his labors "High-heeled Shoes for, Dwarfs in Holiness." And another, ( Crumbs of Comfort for the Chickens of -the Covenant." A Quaker, whose outward man the powers that were thought proper to imprison, published "A Sigh of Sorrow for the Sinners of Zion, breathed out of the Hole in the Wall of an Earthly Vessel, known among men by the name of Samuel Fish." About the same time there was also published, "The Spiritual Mustard-pot, to make the Soul sneeze with Devotion; Salvation's Vantage Ground, or a Louping Stand for Heavy Believers." Another, "A Shot aimed at the Devil's Head-quarters through the Tube of the Cannon of the Covenant." This is an author who speaks plain language, which the most illiterate reprobate cannot fail to understand Another, "A Reaping-hook well tempered, for the Stubborn Ears of the Coming Crop; or, Biscuits Baked in the Oven of Charity, carefully con- served for the Chickens of the Church, the Sparrows of the Spirit, and the Sweet Swallows of Salvation." To another we have the following copious description of its contents: "Seven Sobs of a Sorrowful Soul for Sin, or the Seven Penitential Psalms of the Princely Prophet David; whereunto are also added, William Humius's Handful of Honeysuckles, and Divers Godly and Pithy Ditties now newly augmented." A MAN who was notorious for the healthy and safe size of his under- standings, went to a shoemaker, once upon a time, to get newly shod. The worthy son of Crispin saw him trying to come in at the door, though his efforts were vain, and called out to him--"What will you have, sir!" "Have! I want to get a pair of boots made." "Oh, well then, don't try to come in here, for you can't do it, possibly. Just step round the corner of the building, and you shall have your foot mea- sured. The fact is, sir, we shall be obliged to build a boot over your foot; haint got no last that would come anywhere near it!"

After he had examined it minutely, I asked him how he liked XY BEAUTY (a fool- ish name it goes by among my friends), when he very gravely assured me that ' he had very considerable respect for my character and talents' --so he was pleased td say--' but had not given himself much thought about the degree of my personal pretensions.'" "I was present not long since," continues our much-loved Elia, " at a party of North Britons, where a son of Burns -was expected, and hap. pened to drop a silly expression (in my South-British way) that I wished it were the father instead of the son, when foureof them started up at once, to inform me that that was impossible, because he was dead." A  South Briton, with an unfortunate propensity to be funny-for in Scotland it i8 a misfortune-was dining one day at a dinner table in Edinburgh, when the conversation--as it almost always does on such oecasions-was turned in a strong and very cold stream upon the sub- ject of etymology. In the course of it some one remarked on the singu- lar inaccuracy which was perpetuated in continuing the name of the "Grass-market" to a place in which nothing but cattle and horse-flesh were sold-a most absurd mistake. "Not at all," ventured the English. guest, "for we have it on the best authority that ' Allflesh is grass.'" The joker was solemnly commended for his acuteness, and much grati- tude was expressed to him for having explained away with so much ingenuity an apparent absurdity which could now-thanks to him Hbe no longer laid to the charge of the public authorities of the "' Modern Athens." At a later stage of the conversation, which now turned on   O HT -  HAT.             869 Liebig's system of animal chemistry, a professor showed how true it is that grass is made into beef by the operations of the animated labo- ratories which " chow the cud."   Upon this the jester, seeing an open- ing, and having failed once, tried again; adding that of course "all winter-fed mutton must be turnijps"  "Unquestionably," replied five -men all in spectacles, and then whispered amongst themselves their sur- prise that a mere Englishman should have studied science so deeply.

At the expiration of the time the ink inven- tor called for payment, but on unfolding the scrip, found nothing but a piece of blank paper. The note had been written with his own ink.

THE LIGHT BRIGADE AT BALAKLAVA. BY ALFRED TENNYSON, OF ENGLAND. HALF a league, half a league, Half a league onward, All in the valley of Death Rode the 8ix hundred.

" Forward, the Light Brigade I Take the guans, Nolan said: Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred. " Forward the Light Brigade I" No man was there dismayed, Not though the soldier knew Some one had blundered: Theirs not to make reply, Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die- Into the valley of Death Rode the six hundred, Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them Volleyed and thundered: Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of Hell, Rode the six hundred.

THORavBURN BUYS A M-ooxRn-BIxD. X   T OBNBURND is a bird-fancier whose admiration for feathered song- sters equals a hundred pounds to the square inch. Foir the past eight months, Mr. Thornburn has had his eye on a mocking-bird belonging to his friend Van Orden of this city. In, October last, Mr. Thornburn offered thirty dollars for the bird. Mr. Van Orden refused, saying that the sale of the bird would kill his wife and eldest daughter. In Janu- ary, he advanced from $30 to $40, but Mr. Van Orden still remained firm; he could not consent to kill hs wife and child, even to gratify the zeal of a bird-fancier. On Monday last, Mr. Thornburn met, Mr. Van Orden in State street, and again opened the bird question: "Have you made up your mind to sell that mocking-bird yet " "Not at your price" "Well, if not at my price, at what other price P" "The fact is, I don't want to sell him at all My wife and eldest child are so attached to him, that I cannot bear the idea of parting with him on any terms." Nonsense-get up a counter-irritant. Buy a pair of canaries, and -in- less than a week the mockng-bird will be entirely forgotten. Birds are like husbands-the attachment existing for either is easily re- placeM" "What did you say you would give me for the bird 8" "Forty dollars-I buy him, not for myself but for a gentleman in Lansinghurgh; otherwise I could not afford to make you any such offer."    / "Say fifty, and you can have him" After a good deal of eloquence about matters and things in general, bird-lime  included, a bargain was struck  Mr. Thornburn was to have M r. Van Orden's moclng-lbird "Napoleon" on paying forty-seven dol- lars and a  half. Mr. Thornburn went into Little's book store, counted out the money, and handed it to Mr. Van Orden. Mr. Van Orden folded up the same, and placed it in his pocket. Having done this, he asked for an inch or two of white paper and gave Mr. Thornburn an order on Mrs. Van Orden for the mocking-bird Napoleon-the winged flute that "a gentleman in Lansinghurgh' had set his heart on. Mr. Thornburn took the order and a cage, and left for Mr. Van Orden's residence. He pulled the door bell, and asked for Mrs. Van Orden. Mrs. Van Orden appeared and invited Mr. Thornburn into the parlor. Having taken a  seat, Mr. Thornburn produced the order. - Mrs. Van /    C I T - H aT.           875 Orden said "Certainly." Having said this, she went into the back- room, and soon returned with the "mocking-bird Napoleon." "What's that?" "The bird you've bought." "That one's stuffed l" "I know that-he has been stuffed for more than three weeks. That horrible cold night that we had m January killed not only him, but all my g&amp;aniums."              j "But I bought a live mocking-bird, Mrs. Van Orden." "The order don't say." "If it don't say so, it means so. You can't for a moment imagine that I would pay $50 for a dead mocking-bird, do you!" "I know nothing about it, Mr. Thornburn. The order says, hand Mr. Thornburn the mocking-bird Napoleon. Whether you will take him away depends altogether upon yourself." "I will not take him away, madam. Your husband has been guilty of duplicity, and shall sweat for it." Mrs. Van Orden allowed that a sweat would do him no harm-on the contrary, it would be of advantage to the family, as it would save on fuel. Mr. Thornburn rose from the chair, and left,.not only the house, but the mocking-bird Napoleon. He sought Mr. Van Orden, and asked for " $47 60." Mr. Van Orden laughed at him, and allowed that the money had been invested in a set of furs and an overcoat-the former for Mrs. Van Orden, to prevent the loss of Napoleon from breaking her heart. As Mr. Thornburn could n'ot make an impression on Mr. Van Orden, he repaired to the police office, and asked the advice of the jus- tice. The justice informed Mr. Thornburn that it was a case of sharp practice, but, as it did not amount to a crime, he could not aid him in any manner. Mr. Thornburn then left the court, and commenced a civil suit to recover back the purchase money. If we are not mistaken, the lawsuit entitled "Thornburn v. The Mocking-bird Napoleon," will establish a new list of precedents for our judiciary. How to 1 ll Owls.--"If you find an owl looking at you from a tree," says the Doctor, " and you wish to bring him down without the expense of powder and shot, you have only to keep your eye steadily fixed upon him, and move slowly round the tree; in his eagerness to watch your movements-owls are wise-he forgets to turn his body, and his eyes following yours, his neck is soon twisted off."  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7492-00000195"/> 876 OR-IT-cHAT.

SOMETHNG ON SONN=TS    , "-I WOULD I had my book of sonnets here," cried Slender: most fortu- nate for his hearers they were not on hand. Somehow or other there seems an absurdity about sonnets. It implies love-sickl nonsense: never- theless, there are some splendid instances of this peculiar form of verse. At a dinner, one day, Wordsworth happened to say, Thah Shakspere meant nothing by his famous sonnets: they were merely the flourishes he made in trying his pen before he began a drama. Leigh Hunt, who was present, very adroitly flattered the old bard by saying, "And yet the greatest of living poets has said,' With this key Shakspere unlocked his heart,' alluding to a poem by Wordsworth. The old beadle of Par- nassus (as Dickens called the Sage of Rydal Mount) chuckled at the compliment, as he said, "Ha, hal you have me therel" We do not believe there are above a dozen perfect poems of this kind in the language. Sbakspere has done fine lines; but there is a want of condensation in them fatal to their character. The thought in a sonnet should be orbicular: a perfect gem: the very Pemmican of a poem. Wordsworth has an excellent one on Milton, commencing- "Milton I thou shouldst be living at this hour;" and one still finer to the Tyrolese- "This land we from our fathers had in trust, And to our children must transmit, or die: This is our motto-this our piety, And God and Nature tell us it is just." The finest of all, however, is one that Keats was never tired of repeat- ing. We quote it in extenso: "The world is too much with us: late or soon, Getting and spending we lay waste our powers: Little we see in Nature that is ours. We have given our heart away; a sordid boon ;" and then how grandly the old Christian recognises the poetry of Pagan- ism, and proclaims his brotherhood with Homer, Hesiod, Anacreon, Sappho, and the glorious old Greeks, when he says "Great Heaven, I'd rather be A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn I So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn-- Have sight of Venus rising from the sea, And hear old Triton blow-his wreathed horn!"  &#xD;<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC7492-00000196"/> 378            OH ITO HAT.

The sonnet of Keats, upon first reading Chapman's Homer, is very fine, more especially the closing lines.- "Then felt I like some watcher of the skies, When a new planet swims into his ken: Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes He stared at the Pacific, and all his men Looked at each other with a wild surprise,-- Silent upon a peak of Darien." "EGIBLE HANDS. WE question if one thousandth part of the -malaproposisms resulting from " a villanous handwriting" have ever come to light. Coleridge, in his Biographia literaria, relates one sufficiently amusing. When he was secretary to Sir Alexander Ball, the Governor of Malta, a gen- tleman of Peckham, who wrote a somewhat mysterious hand, requested, in a letter to a merchant there, "that he would send him one or two monkeys." About three months after, as the "( owner of the curious handwriting" was sitting at the window of his Peckham villa, he was astonished by observing several outlandish sailors coming up his garden path, leading a regiment of monkeys, dressed in the usual grotesque fashions. Rush- ing to the door with a sort of frantic presentiment, the foremost of the monkey leaders handed him a letter, in which his Maltese agent ex- pressed his profound regret that he could not send him the full number of monkeys ordered, but had, at a great expense, bought up 57, which ,          oeta   he  rdder   noerue    ot  eln   a  ecn   879 OHT-OHAT- 'et               so he 'he woulia receive herewith, and that the balance of the 102 (for o he h'ad read the 1 or 2) would follow by the next vessel." While we are on this theme, we, may as well cull one from that venerable author, Mr Miller. A gentleman having received a favor from a friend, wrote to express his thanks, and t o beg his acyeptanse of an equivalent, which he intended forwarding in the course of i few days. Unfortunately, the handwriting was so defective, that his friend read it unfortunately. the handi ng           n  dation of elephant.

This, however, will answer for prose as well as poetry. Cnr- lyle hns improved upon it by saying, "The best eord in the best place." Browning told us that "4 it was the inspiration of Broangua while Horne calls it "the paion of  thought."

But while poets themselves diffo.-as Xto the definition, there can be no doubt as tothe effeot Whibhbpoetry hes upon the human heart. Let us give a few blasts from our poetic horn. Shakspere carries simile to its height when he advises a lover to for- get his adored... .. "Rouse but yourself, and the weak wanton CUpid Will from your neck unloose his amorous fold, And like a dew-drop from a lion's mane, Be shook to air." The ladies no doubt excuse Shakspere for advising lovers to forget their lasses in so cavalier a fashion by reason of the delicate compliment he pays them in calling them " dew-drops." Suckling has a pleasant verse upon a lady's lip, that "mouth of Hea- ven," as General Morris calls thiem.  Her lips were red, and one was thin, Compared with that was next her chin, Tpome bee had stung it newly. Spenser makes Una call the Red Cross Knight "The God of all her life;" We cannot define this: we feel its poetry. What husband can read Coleridge's verses to his absent wife without a "sighing groan." O Mary,'make thy gentle'lap otr pillow,  Bend o'er us, like a bower, my beautiful green willow. While we are in the spiritual presence of Coleridge, we will ask him for another glimpse of his poetical transfiguration.  His Christabel abounds in that fine madness of thought, which finds language a sort of strait-waistcoat to its inspired proportions.  What a charming apparition is this--   .   OHT-OUAT.               881 There she sees a damsel bright, Dressed in a robe of silken white, That shadowy in the moonlight shone, The neck that made that white robe wan; Her stately neck and arms were bare. Her blue-veined feet unsapdalled were, And wildly glittered here and there, The gems entangled in her hair. I guess 'twas frightful there to see A lady so richly clad as she, Beautiful exceedingly,. What lover of rural retreat can fail to long to hire the hermitage Spenser has described I Why, even a fashionable lady would send an upholsterer to furnish it without having paid the quarter's rent in ad vance.           . A little lowly hermitage it was Down in a dale hard by a forest's side, Par from resort of people that did pass In' travel to and fro: a little wide There was a holy chapel edified, Wherein the hermit duly went to say His holy things each morn and eventide; Thereby a crystal fount, did always play, Which from a sacred fountain welled forth alway What a different sensation this leaves on the mind from the misan- thropical verse of Cowper, when he cries out in the very anguish ofj his soul-- ,Oh! for a Ddge in some vast wilderness, Some boundless continuity of shade, Where rumors of oppression and deceit, Of un   successful and Successful war, Might never reach me more." Mark the difference.  Spenser loves a country retreat for its own inherent quiet and abstraction, while the other loves it merely to avoid the evils the he world. In short, Cowper always seems to us as he is generally drawn,!" a poet in his night-cap." Michael Drayton (one of the jolly fellows who persuaded Shakspere to go " on a bust" b efore he recovered from' his fever, and consequently helped to kill the sweet swan of Avon) says of Marlowe, what may be called a good dash at poetry. Next Marlowe bathed in the Thespian Springs, Had in him those brave, translunary things  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7492-00000198"/> 382             H IT-OCHAT. is That the first poets had; tis raptures were All air and fire, which made his verses clear, For that fine madness still he did retain, Which rightly should possess a poet's brain. It is a singular -fact that Shakspere has only named two of his contem- poraries in the whole range of his multifarious works. Marlowe is thus alluded to: "Dead shepherd-now I know thy law of might, Who ever loved that loved not at first sight!" This verse is in Marlowe's poem of Hero and Leander, a poem fin- ished by Geo. Chapman, the eminent translator of Homer. By-the- bye, what was Homer's Christian name    William, Thomas, John, or Jacob?, Talking of Christopher Marlowe reminds us of one of the mightiest lines in the whole range of thought. When Faustus, the great necromancer, pants for Beauty, he demands that the devil should gratify his desires thus: "Bring me, Through the thick millioned catacomb of ages, Helen's unsullied loveliness to these arms." And in his invocation to the beauty of Troy how fine is the line: "Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss!" And how clearly-he describes her- "O thou-art fairer than the evening air, Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars!" We must close this chit-chat of poetry by singing with Keats, "A thing of beauty is a joy for ever." This is also the best description of a Millennium we have met with-- let us therefore hope that the Millennium is the Poetry of the World.

ORMORI MoRuls, like Sir Philip Sidney, has preferred writing the songs of his native land to making its laws. His ballads are consequently " the household words" of America, for they inevitably wind their way to the heart. Indeed, for a simplicity very unusual, they possess a fund of genuine pathos, which will for ever keep them alive in the public rmin&amp; Many believe that it is a very easy thing to write: a song, when, the fact is, a true song is one of the rarest achievements of the poet. It is almost a gift as distinct as that of poetry itself. How very few good songs we have in the English language. And the reason is plain. A song should contain a definite idea, so tersely expressed, that, like a strain of music, it should leave the sense of com- pleteness. It must appeal to some great element of the heart, and be either patriotic, pthetic, or tender. Every word should be familiar without being commonplace. A good song is an Iliad in a nutshell. Its author requires a refined, sen- sitive, and critical mind, thoroughly conversant with the human heart, both in its aspirations and its regrets. His soul must not soar like the eagle, but brood like the dove. He must not roam through the world like Shakspere and Dante, but sit and sing by the Fireside of the Million. Every nation has its favorite song-writer, and every popular minstrel reflects the leading peculiarity of the national heart. Beranger reflects the grace, polish, vivacity, and satire of France; Burns breathes of the heaths, the hills, and the mountain rills of Scot- land; while Moore has all the sparkling sentiment of the highly cultured nature. Morris is purely Saxon,--his phraseology has a neat homeliness, which is the7 pure simplex mundtitii of domestic life, Dibdin, notwithstanding his occasional pathos, power, and patriotism, pitched his note too much in a party key. His songs, famous as they were in their time, will therefore float away with the war spirit that inspired them. Wolfe's Burial of Sir John Moore can hardly be called a song in the strict acceptation of the term. Although full of fine poetical feeling, it is the celebration of a man, and not the comnbination of a familiar thought, so delicately wrought that, like a beautiful melody, it becomes dearer every time it is heard. Tennyson's Lord of Burleigh, although it evidently contains the senti- ment of a guileless girl withering beneath the glare of a splendor to  &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7492-00000199"/> o CIT-CHAT. which she was not born, and which was moreover foreign to her nature, is more a Greek lyric, worthy of Simonides or Musmus, than a song.

MaE head-dresses of the ladies, during my youth, were of a truly pre- posterous size. ,I have gone to Ranelagh ,in a coach with a lady who was obliged to sit upon a stool placed in the bottom of the coach, the height of her head-dress not allowing her to occupy the regular seat. Their tight lacing was equally absurd. Lady Crewe told me, that, on returning home from Ranelagh, she has rushed up to her bed-room, and desired her maid to cut her laces without a moment's delay, for fear she should faint. Dr. FoRDYcE sometimes drank a good deai at dinner. He was sum- moned one evening to see a lady patient, when he was more than half- seas-over, and conscious that he was so. Feeling her pulse, and finding himself unable to count its beats, he muttered, "Drunk, by God!" Next morning, recollecting the circumstance, he was greatly vexed: and just as he was thinking what explanation of his behavior he should offer to the lady, a letter from her was put into his hand. "She too well knew," said the letter, c" that he had discovered the unfortunate condition in which she was when he last visited her; and she entreated him to keep the matter secret in consideration of the inclosed (a hun- dred-pound bank-note)." SmR GEORGE BEAUONT. once met Quin at a very small dinner-party. There was a delicious pudding, which the master of the house, pushing the dish towards Quin, begged him to taste. A gentleman had just before helped himself to an immense piece of it. "Pray," said Quin, looking first at the gentleman's plate and then at the dish, " which is the pudding!"

Aston. Various persons were seated at different tables. Among others present, there was an Irishman who was very celebrated as a duellist, having killed at least half-a-dozen antagonists. Aston, talking to some of his acquaintance, swore that he would make the duellist stand bare- footed before them. "You had better take care what you say," they replied; "he has his eye upon you."-"No matter," rejoined Aston. "I declare again that he shall stand barefooted before you, if you will make up among you a purse of fifty guineas." They did so. Aston then said in a loud voice, "I have been in Ireland, and am  well acquainted witi the natives." The Irishman was all ear. Aston went on, "The Irish, being born in the bogs, are every one of them web- footed; I know it for a fact."-"Sir," roared the duellist, starting up from his table, "it is false!"Aston persisted in his assertion, "Sir," cried the other, "Iwas born in Ireland; and I will prove to you that it is a falsehood." So saying, in great haste he pulled off his shoes and stockings, and displayed his bare feet. The joke ended in Aston's shar- xng the purse between the Irishran and himself, giving the former thirty guineas, and keeping twenty. Sir George assured me that this was a true story. TOPHEM  BEAUCLERK (Johnson's friend) was a strangely absent person. One day he had a  party coming to dinner; and, just before their arri- val, he went up-stairs to (hange his dress. He forgot all about them; thought it was bed-time, pulled off his clothes, and got into bed. A servant, who/presently entered the room  to tell him that his guests were waiting for him, found him fast asleep. WmEN Lord Erskine heard that somebody had died worth two hun- dred thousand pounds, he observed, "Well, that's a very pretty sum to begin the next world with." "A FMREND of mine," said Erskine, " was suffering from a continual wakefulness; and various methods were tried to send him to sleep, but in vain. At last his physicians resorted to an experiment which suc- ceeded perfectly: they dressed him in a  watchman's coat, put a lan- tern into his hand,  placed him into a sentry-box, and-he was asleep in ten minutes.  HERE'S an epigram by Erskine which is far from bad (I know not if it has ever been printed): .

DuiINo Sheridan's last illness, the medical attendants apprehending that they would be obliged to perform an operation on him, asked him if he had ever undergone one. "Never," replied Sheridan, "except when sitting for my picture, or having my hair cut." SHERIDAN had very fine eyes, and he was not a little vain of them. He said to me on his death-bed, "Tell Lady Besborough that my eyes will look up to the coffin-lid as brightly as ever." I sAW Lunardi make the first ascent in a ballooh which had been witnessed in England. It was from the Artillery Ground. Fox was there with his brother General F. The crowd was immense. Foxt, happening to put his hand down to his watch, found another hand upon it, which he immediately seized. "My friend," said he to the owner of the strange hand, "you have chosen an occupation which will be your ruin at last."- "Oh, Mr. Fox," was the reply, "( forgive me, and let'me go 1 I have been driven to this course by necessity alone; my wife and children are starving at home." ' Fox, always tender-hearted, slipped a guinea into the hand, and then released it. On the con- clusion of the show, Fox was proceeding to look what o'clock it was. "Good God," cried he, "my watch is gone l"--"Yes," answered Gene- ral F., "I know it is; I saw your friend take it"-"Saw him take it! and you made no attempt to stop him "--"Really, you and he ap- peared to be on such good terms with each other, that I did not choose to interfere." THERE was no end to Foote's jokes about Garrick's parsimony. "Gar- rick," said Foote, "lately invited Hurd to dine with him in the Adel- phi; and after dinner, the evening being very warm, they walked up and down in front of the house. As they passed and repassed the dining-room windows, Garrick was in a perfect agony; for he saw that there was a thief in one of the candles which were burning on the table: and yet Hurd was a person of such consequence that he ould not run away from him to prevent the waste of his tallow.", AT the Chapter Coffee-House, Foote- and his friends were making a contribution for the relief of a poor fellow (a decayed player, I believe),  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7492-00000201"/> who was nieknamed the Captain of the Four Winds, because his hat was worn into four spouts. Each person of the company dropped his mite into the hat, as it was held out to him.

The middle-aged lady replied, "I 'annot see any particular beauty in her."--Ah, madam," he rejoined 'to us oldtmen youth always appears beautifula (a speech with which rordsworth, when I repeated it to him, was greatly struck).-The fact S, till we are about to leave theworld, we do not perceive how much b contains to excite our interest and admiration: the sunsets appear to ae far lovelier now than they were in other years; and the bee upon h1e flower-is nowan object of curiosity to me, which it was not in my arly days.                  i w i .       -    .

Speaking of something which he would not do on any inducement, he exclaimed vehemently, "I had rather be hanged upon twenty gibbets."--"Don't you think, sir, that one would be enough for you " said a girl, a stranger, who was sitting at the table next to us. I wish yolu could have seen Curran's face. AFTRa Legge was appointed Bishop of Oxford, he had the folly to ask two wits, Canning and Frere, to be present at his first sermon. "Well'" said he to Canning, " how did you like it?--" Why, I thought it rather -short."--"Oh, yes, I am aware that it was short; but I was afraid of being tedious,"-"You were tedious." A LADY having. put to Canning the silly question, "Why have they made the space in the iron gate at Spring Gardens so narrowS" he replied, "Oh, ma'am, because such very fat people used to go through" (a reply concerning which Tom Moore said, that " the person who does not relish it can have no perception of real wit"). I ONCE mentioned to Canning the anecdote, that, while Gray was at Peter House, Cambridge, some young men of the college having learned that he had a fire-escape in his rooms, alarmed him in the middle of the night by a cry of " fire,"-and that presently Gray descended from the window by a ladder of ropes, and tumbled into a tub of water, which the rogues had placed there;-upon which, Canning added, " they had made a mistake in calling out 'fire,' when they meant to cry ' water. " LoRD SHBLBuE:Nz could say the most provoking things, and yet appear quite unconscious of their being so. In one of his speeches, alluding to Lord Carlisle, he said, "Thenoble lord has written a comedy." "No, a tragedy."-" Oh, I beg pardon; I thought it was a comedy." AFTER she had left the stage, Mrs. Siddons, from the want of excite- meat, was never happy.

During the first day's journey, Lord Ellenborough, happening to stretch his legs, struck his feet against something below the seat. lie discovered that it was a bandbox His indignation is not to be described. Up went the window, and out went the bandbox. The coachman stopped; and the footmen, thinking that the bandbox had tumbled out of the window by some extraordinary chance, were going to pick it up, when Lord Ellenborough furiously called out, "Drive on!"The bandbox accordingly was left by a ditch-side. Having reached the county-town where he was to officiate as judge, Lord Ellenborough proeeded to array himself for his appearance in the court-house. "Now," said he, "where's my wig,-where is my wig!"-"My Lord," replied his atten. dant, ' it was thrown out of the carringe-window."

LABOR..--A  bar of iron valued at $5, worked into horseshoes, is worth $10 50; needles, $356; penknife blades, $3,285; shirt buttons, $29,480; balance springs of watches, $250,000.

Rochefoucauld goes so far as to say that there is something in the misfortunes of our best friends not altogether displeasing to us. We don't mean to say that' this is the next thing to "relishing a murder," but it is akin to it. Leigh Hunt tells a .story which exemplifies it. One day at Pisa, when Shelley, Trelawny, and himself, were dining with Lord Byron, the latter had a sudden and violent attack of colie, a complaint to which he was subject. He was assisted to a sofa, where he lay writhing in agony, and crying out vehemently that he was dying. - After one of his loudest ejaculations, Trelawny approached the " sick man,". and said, "Hush, hush I my dear fellow; "don't make so much 'fu48' about dying, if you please." The excessive coolness of this made even Byron laugh. A Tar's Idea of a Locomotive.--"Why," says he, i" there's nothing manly about it. Watch a ship, now, with her canvas bellying out, laying down to it just enough to show she feels the breeze, tossing the spray from her bows, and lifting her head over the seas, as if she stepped over 'em. There's something like life there. There's some- thing noble about a horse; he steps as if he knew he was going, and proud of his duty, and able to do it. But the lubber-bahll! that there concern comes insinivating, sneaking along, crawling on his belly like a thundering long snake, with a pipe in his mouth." More of Dr. Johnson's Table-Talk.-I asked him whether, as a moralist, he did not think that the practice of the law, in some degree, hurt the nice feeling of honesty. Johnson.-Why, no, sir, if you act properly. You are not to deceive your clients with false representations of your opinion; you are not to tell lies to a judge. Boswell.-But what do you think of supporting a cause which you know to be bad  Johnson.-Sir, you do not know it to be good or bad till the judge determines it. I have said that you are to state facts fairly; so that your thinking, or what you call knowing a cause to be bad, must be from  reasoning, must be from your supposing your arguments to be weak and inconclusive. But, sir, that is not enough. An argument which does not convince yourself may convince the judge to whom you  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7492-00000204"/> urge it; and if it does convince him, why, then, sir, you are wrong, and he is right. It ishis business to judge; and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cause is bad, but to say all you can for your client, and then hear the judge's opinion. Boswell.-But, sir, does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth, and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion, does not such dissimulation impair one's honesty Is there not some danger that a lawyer may put on the same mask in common life, in the intercourse with his friends? Johnson.-Why, no, sir. Everybody knows you are paid for affect- ing warmth for your client; and it is, therefore, properly no dissimula- tion: the moment you come from  the bar you resume your usual behavior. Sir, a man will no more carry the artifice of the bar into the common intercourse of society, than a man who is paid for tumbling upon his hands will continue to tumble u-on his hands -hea he should walk on his feet. Xro-C to get Clear of a Crying Infant.-Tom Dibdin relates, in his Reminiscences, that a pompous actor, by the name of Newton, playing one evening at Tunbridge Wells, was very much annoyed by the crying of an infant in the pit. Walking forward to the front of the stage, he gravely took off his hat, and with great solemnity, addressed the astonished mother as follows:- "Ma-dam, I  assure you, upon the veracity of a man aind a gentle- man, that unless you instantly adopt some method of keeping the play quiet, it will be morally impossible for the child to proceed." The mistake set the house in a roar of laughter, which frightened the unhappy infant into a  scream  , o80 loud and dread," that the disap. pointed mother was of necessity obliged to retire with her offspring, and resign the expected pleasureof the evening. A    QUAINT PERMON. ME. DODD was a minister who lived, many years ago, a   few miles from Cambridge; and having several times been preaching against drunkenness, some of the Cambridge scholars (conscience, which is sharper than ten thousand witnesses, being their monitor) were very much offended, and thought he made reflections on them. Some time after, Mr. Dodd was walking thwards Cambridge,- and met some of the gownemen, who, as soon as they saw him at a distance, resolved to make   U 11 'T - U n A T.    ;Y5 some ridicule of him. As soon as he came up, they accosted him with, "Your servant, sir 1"He replied, "Your servant, gentlemen." They asked him if he had not been preaching very much against drunkenness of late I He answered in the affirmative. They then told him they had a favor to beg of him, and it was that he would preach a sermon to them there, from a text they should choose. He argued that it was an imposition, for a man ought to have some consideration before preach- ing. They said they would not put up with a denial, and insisted upon his preaching immediately (in a hollow tree which stood by the road- side) from the word MALT. He then began:- "Beloved, let me crave your attention. I am a little man-come at a short notice-to preach a short sermon-from a short text-to a thin congregation-in an unworthy pulpit.  Beloved, my text is Malt. I cannot divide it into sentences, there being none; nor into words, there being but one; I must, therefore, of necessity, divide it into letters which I find in my text th be-M, A, L, T.
