NEW YORK: GARRETT &amp; CO., 18 ANN STREET. 1853.    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6833-00000002"/> EVA MAY. THE FOUNDLING OF THE POOR-HOUSE   CHAPTER I,   THE MOTHER AND HER SIN. IT was the month of May, that beautiful and fresh season of the year when the trees and fields clothe themselves with blossoms, and when balmy gales whisper gently of a coming and more fervent heat which shall change the blossoms both of tree and field, into golden grain and fruit. Bright and glad-hearted May! Time's angel of hope and promise! standing on the confines of the chill snows and bleak winds of winter, and,  with the living green of earth's verdure for thymantle, and the diamond drops of the  sunny showers-of the skies for thy falling and clustering locks, pointing to the warm  and growing summer, and the mellow and  ripening autumn, when the hope and prom-  ise of thy verdure and thy showers, shall be fulfilled to man in his garner-house, well stored with the rich produce of the earth!  Can it be, Oh joyous May, that amid qo   'flowers and verdure, beneath thy blue skies and with thy gentle breath upon the cheek, there can be such a thing as despair in the heart of man or woman? Can either, in such a season raise the head, and cursing the day in which they were born, welcome nay, seek with outstretched arms, the em-, brace of death? Alas! all this can be, is, has been, and ever will be. There is a des- pair which no smiles of earth or sky, nor gentle voices of the air can drive away-a blank despair which burns like fire into the soul, and over which even hope itself with leaden knell drops the black pall of eternal night. There was such despair, in the smiling month of May, 18-, on one of the high roads leading out of the city of New York, and within the boundaries of a town- ship which we shall call by the assumed name of Greenburgh. It was night, calm, Deaceful, and cloud-    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6833-00000003"/> less, the air filled with the perfume of flow- ers, and grove and meadow bright with the silver radiance of the moon and stars.- One solitary figure was alone to be seen, as far as the eye could reach on the road to which we have above referred. The figure was that of a woman bearing a child in her arms, and toiling painfully and wearily, now through the heavy sand, and now, over the rough and stony hillocks, which marked the character of the pathway before her. The woman was evidently not more than twenty years of age, but the lines of care and suffering visible in her countenance, gave to her the appearance of being much older. The infant which she carried could scarcely have been three months old. Her own dress, together with that of her child, was wretched in the extreme. A frock of dark woolen stuff, tattered and much soiled with dirt, was partly covered with an old fashioned, red cloth clcak, with a hood lined with silk which had once been of a bright green color, but which age and use had changed to a dingy yellow hue. A straw bonnet also much the worse for wear, and a pair of half worn out morocco shoes, through which her bare feet could be seen, completed the main articles of her apparel, while that of her child can only be des- cribed by calling it a bundle of soiled white rags. And yet there was beauty in this poverty, grief stricken woman and her puny child- beauty in her which many a proud daugh- of wealth and luxury, might have envied- beauty in the child which many a rich and high-born mother would have rejoiced to have seen in the face of her own offspring. The hair of the woman was jet black, un- combed, disheveled, but falling down on her shoulders in glossy and silken luxuri- ance; her forehead was high, clear, and white as Parian-marble; the nose was Gre- cian, chiseled in faultless outline, while through the delicate curve of the lips there run a line of ruby red in strong and beau- tiful contrast with the paleness of the rest of the face, and which neither care nor suf- fering had dimned at all in the freshness of   its color. But her most striking feature, and one in which a strange, wild, and al- most unearthly beauty, shone out, was the eye. It was large, black and lustrous, and although now downcast, and heavy, beneath its long silken eyelashes, except when at intervals it flashed with indignation as she seemed to dream of some remembrance of the past, or melted into tenderness as she looked down upon her child, was still an eye which, one glance sufficed to show, must have had in its dark, slumbering depths, in her days of joy, an irresistible power of fascination. It possessed that power now, even in the day of her evident despair. Such was the woman traveling wearily over the uneven road, now gazing wildly, behind her, now hopelessly forward, now tenderly down upon her child, when the lit- tle wan face that met her gaze, wore a smile, and a white and attenuated little arm was feebly lifted as if in play. But there is no fondling in return for thee, poor wretch- ed infant, for the heart against which thou art pressed is throbbing madly with its mighty despair, and although it loves thee wildly, sickens at thy smile. And there is no time to chuckle thy dimpled chin, for far and far beyond stretches the road, with no dwelling yet in sight, and the shadows of the moon are growing longer on the ground. Onward and onward, is there no pause or rest for the failing footsteps? Whither thy journey. weak, fainting, crazed and des- pairing woman, with the wan but smiling child? Is thine the old story of the woman with her sin, driven as an outcast from the parental roof, rejected and spurned by the author of thy ruin, starving because thou wilt sin no more, flying from the crowded and stifling city of thy shame, far into the country, striving to escape from that which thou canst not, and journeying thou know- est not, carest not whither, attended in all thy footsteps by two grim spectres of terror -Infanticide on the one hand, with his grasp upon thy child-Suicide on the other with his grasp upon thyself? Is this, poor woman, thy story, a story as [d as sin itself, full of horror and of pity,   and of the waters of a grief that might fall in tears from an angel's eyes? Come rest here on this grassy knoll, just where a little stream crosses the road under the shadow of a thick wood-rest here and whisper to us thy story. Yes, the weary frame can endure no more, thou sinkest on the bank with thy little burden; but thy breath is short and thou hast no voice to speak. But hark, there is a feeble cry in thy arms, and there is the clutch of a little hand upon thy breast. How thy own hand trembles as uncovering the alabaster fountain of life thou strainest to it convulsively thy in- fant's lips. But alas, the fountain is dry, and the big tear is silently falling down thy cheek. Weep not, thou hast naught to give, but some angel has whispered in the ear of thy child, and see, it closes its eyes in sleep, and its little lips are curved in a smile of content even on the exhausted source from which it has in vain striven to draw the stream of nourishment. And thine own eye too is heavy, it droops, it closes, and thou too sleepest, feverishy and uneasily, for thou art dreaming in the cold light of the moon as it falleth down on thee and thy child on the bank by the road- side stream. What is thy dream? In the vision of the sleeper, the veil of the past rolls up and the dream is this. The sleeper is again standing, a lovely and innocent maiden in her childhood's home, far away over the ocean, in one of the greatest cities Europe. That home is hum- ble but there is joy and competence within it, and she is the centre of that joy, the pride of her parent's eyes and the object on which that competency, humble as it is, is lavished with an unsparing hand. And her life passed happily onward, admired, loved, and bringing many a worthy swain to her feet to sue for her hand. But she turns a deaf ear to all, and listens but to one voice which alone has power to charm her. That voice belongs to a proud, cold- hearted man, far above her own rank in life, who worships his monby as his God, and serves his own sensuality as his only master. To gain and keep the one he would   sacrifice any principle of right, to gratify the other and then throw aside the instru- ment of his gratification when satiated with its enjoyment, there was no art too subtle for him to employ and no act too base for him to commit. A father's and a mother's tears and prayers, for they see through the designs of the evil spirit that would pluck and destroy the flower of their home, are of no avail with the maiden, who rushes with the wildness and trust of an infatuated pas- sion into the arms of the spoiler. And now come the cloud and the darkness over the maiden's life. A withering curse from her father's roof rings in her ears; coldness and cruel desertion soon afterwards, on the part of her seducer, follow, and the fallen one is alone with poverty, despair and the evidence of her sin. She hears that her de- stroyer has emigrated to America; she sells her rich dresses and trinkets and has- tens after him. In her dream, the sleeper is again on board of the crowded emigrant ship, in the confined, foul, and hot cabin into which neither the light nor air of Heaven penetrates, insulted by the brutal captain and his savage crew, knocked and shoved about, and in sufferings and priva- tions, which bring her to the doors of death, she gives birth to the fruit of her sin and shame. And then follow the landing of the wretched mother and her child in a strange land ; the finding of her faithless lover and the terrible result. She is spurn- ed from his door with a curse, as an impos- tor, and then- The dreamer starts from her sleep with a half smothered shriek of horror and fear, for the child has dropped from her arms and is tumbling slowly down the slightly in- clined bank towards the swift rolling stream. Woman of sin, of sorrow, and of despair! why is thy shriek of fear suppressed in its utterance, and why that strange gleam, half of horror, and half of insane joy, in thy eye? Has the Demon of Child Murder taken pos- session of all thy being I Is not the feeble wail of thy infant falling nearer and nearer to the river of death, on thy ear, and why is not thy hand, with the speed of lightning    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6833-00000004"/> outstretched to snatch thy child from a watery grave? Will not holy Nature. stirred within thee by some good angel, plead with a voice of mighty power for thy innocent offspring? It will, it does, a moment more, and the Demon has vanished from thy side and thy Guardian Angel holds thee in his unseen embrace. There has been a rush of thy dark garments through the moonlight, thy little, guiltless child, its head already wet with the waters of the stream, is again nestling on thy bosom, and thou art kneel- ing on the green sod with thy eyes upturned to Heaven in prayer. Pray on, pray on, thon hast been saved from a damning crime, and thy prayer shall be balm and strength to thy soul. Onward and onward, by the fast waning light of the moon, under the thick and over- hanging trees through which the road now,   Ileads, the woman with her child is again journeying, her steps more firm and her lcountenance more calm and hopeful. The 'wood is passed, and emerging into an open and a fertile plain, the wanderer beholds, gleaming before her, the lights of a spacious mansion which rises proudly and grandly in the centre of a wide lawn tastefully laid out in the greenest of grass-plots, and thick with flowering shrubs and trees of luxuriant foliage. She reaches the door and knocks, not timorously but with a bold and confi- dent stroke. Certainly it is a rich man's house in a christian land, and food and shelter will surely be given, at this hour of the night, to the wanderer and her child. Before we listen to the answer to that knock on the door of that spacious mansion in the lovely lawn, we will look within and learn ,the character of the inmates.   CHAPTER II.   THE INSIDE OF THE RICH MAN'S HOUSE, AND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE OF THE POOR. THE room in the mansion of the lawn, to which we will now introduce the reader, is a comfortable, cozy apartment, plainly but richly furnished with massive mahogany furniture, and forming at once, as was com- mon in country houses at the period when the events of our story took place, the com- mon sitting and dining room of the family. A square mahogany table, with a green baize cloth underneath to protect the car- pet, stands in the centre of the room and on it two sperm candles are burning. Two men are seated at the table, the one consid- erably advanced in years, his hair thin and white, his features regular; nose slightly arched; lips thin, compressed, and blood- less; eyes small, grey, and deeply sunken behind heavy and bristling eyebrows; com- plexion pale and rather inclined to a sallow look; figure portly and of full height. Alto- gether he is an unpleasing looking man, rather repulsive than otherwise, and all owing to that little grey eye of his far back in his head. That eye has the expression P of a hawk, it says as plain as words could speak it, "I am ready to pounce upon you." No one, regarding that eye attentively, would ever dream that there was connected with it any soul or heart, to which pity could find an entrance, or in which any thing like noble and generous feeling could have a resting place or existence. The old man with the hawk-eye is engaged in tumb- ling over a bundle of papers from which he has just removed the piece of red tape by which they had been bound. From this lat-   ter circumstance and from the manner in which they are folded and labeled. the pa- pers are evidently of a legal nature. The old man's companion at the table is apparently about thirty-five years of age, with bushy black hair, features heavy and pock-marked, and eyes large, shaped very much like those of a cat and wearing very much the same expression. The man with the cat-eye is attentively watching the man with the hawk-eye. The pair are well matched -a master and his imp of evil, ready ait all times and in all places to pounce upon a a victim, and ever watching to gain, each from the other, anything and everything except the small quantity of soul between the two, which each by tacit consent seems to think is not of enough value to form the object of the smallest game or the subject of the slightest mention or attention. There are three other occupants of the room beside the two which we have just mention- ed. One is an elderly lady with a thin and wiry face, immense false curls, a remarka- bly fresh and deep color in remarkably well defined spots on each cheek, a black and glittering eye, and a prim carriage of the neck and head, meant to represent a proud and stately bearing, but breaking down in the attempt and exhibiting only a palpable and very poor imitation. The lady is seated in a large rocking chair, and while her fingers are plying her knitting needles in the formation of what appears to be a silken purse, she looks over approving- Iv and proudly at the old man by the table. At her feet a boy and girl, the one about six and the other four years old, are play-    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6833-00000005"/> ing. The head of the boy is a perfect mass or black and clustering locks,his eyes also black intelligent, full of fire, but mingled with a scarcely perceptible sinister expression.- The little girl is a perfect model of meek infantile beauty. Guilessness of heart and sweetness of disposition are written in legible characters on her fair and open countenance, and to look upon her light au- burn hair already falling in luxuriant curls down her neck, and her mild blue eyes so soft and saint-like in their expression, is but to have the heart drawn strongly towards her with the irresistible power of an invol- untary love. Such is the description of the different persons in the group in the sitting room of, the mansion to which we have introduced our readers. But who are they? The old man with the hawk-eye, is Hold- fast Sharp. Esq., Attorney and Counsellor at Law and Solicitor in Chancery, of the village of Greenburgh. The lady is Mrs. Holdfast Sharp, and the two children are Frederick and Mary, the sole offspring of the union of Mr. and Mrs. Sharp. The man with the cat-eye is Runyon Dooall, with no Esq. to the end of his name, but acting in the capacity of chief running clerk and mall of all-work to Holdfast Sharp Esq., and contenting himself for lack of title on his own part, in the reflected light of the title of his augut employer. Holdfast Sharp was born in the state of Connecticut. His father Seth Sharp was a very worthy cooper and one of the keenest of men to be found in a state whose reputa- tion for the general keenness of all its citi- zens has long since become a proverb.- Seth Sharp was always proud of this great feature of his character which all his neigh- bors gave to him the credit of possessing in a remarkable degree, and when his first and only heir was born, he looked with great complacency on the twinkling grey little eyes which were staring very curiously around at the new sights on which they just opened, and turning to his wife he said: "Jemima Sharp, if there is one thing more than another that I do like to see in   man and child, and woman too, Jemima Sharp, it is cuteness: Now look, Mrs. Sharp, at them eyes of that 'ere child, they're cute atd no mistake, he must make a cute boy, or I'll lick him like thunder to know why. It's in him and I'm darned if it shant come out!" How much farther Mr. Seth Sharp might have dilated on this favorite subject of his, it is impossible to determine, for he was in- terrupted by Mrs. Jemima Sharp, who in no very musical tone remarked: "Seth Sharp, I rayther guess you're a leetle too quick about licking my child; if he wants licking I calculate I can lick him myself, but I reckon that just now he wants more 'lasses than licking." Seth Sharp made no answer to his wife, but quietly put on his white wool hat and walked out to his cooper shop. Time passed on, and the vision of the young Sharp grew more comprehensive and observing, his limbs waxed stronger, and undeniable evidence was daily given of the power of his lungs and the force of his will. It became also, at length, in the natuial course of events, necessary to give young Sharp a christian name. This formed a sub- ject of some argument and consultation be- tween Seth Sharp and his wife. The former however finally settled it by remarking: "Jemima Sharp, I've made up my mind  you see my last name is good-very good- Sharp-that means cute, and cuteness, as I've told you a thousand times, is what I do like all-fired well, I've alvays been glad that my last name is Sharp; but my first name. Seth, aint much. Dad liked it be- cause it was scriptur. Scriptur is good, but Seth ain't a handsome name for all that. Now, I want our boy to have his first name to fit his last jist as I make my staves fit together in a cider barrel. Therefore, as the law papers say, Jemima Sharp, I shall name our boy Holdfast Sharp-ain't that a beauty of a name-be sharp', git all you can, have your staves all right, Jemima, but your cider barrel ain't good for nothing without your whoops is all right to hold the staves fast. Holdfast Sharp-Jeminy,   what a name! you know the old saying, Jemima, 'keep what you've got and git what you can.' Now, Jemima, that's jist the meaning of Holdfast Sharp, and there- fore Holdfast Sharp is the name for that 'ere young 'un." And IIoldfast Sharp the boy was named. It is unnecessary for us to follow him through his boyish days. He early devel- oped that cuteness, in which his father so much delighted, in various ways, trading marbles, jack-knives, &amp;c. But as years rolled on, hiscuteness aspired to a higher range than his father ever dreamed of. His father had sent him to the district school, (and an excellent one it was, far better than any his father, himself, had hlad the oppor- tunity of enjoying) and young Holdfast had improved his advantages well. He looked, however for something higher, and at the early age of fourteen years, he be- gan to beg his father to send him to college. He wished, he said, to be a lawyer. The very flourishing condition of an attorney in the village, filled the eye of young Sharp, and he longed to have his wishes realized. The nature of the business seemed natural- ly to assimilate itself even to his youthful mind, while the example before him, of the rich profits it could be made to produce, filled his head with dreams of wealth.- Seth Sharp had laid up money, and both he and his wife being very proud of their son, they consented to gratify him. To Yale College, therefore, he was sent, and graduated with an established reputation for great talent and great meanness. In due course of study, he obtained his diplo- ma as an attorney, and immediately re- moved to the thriving little village of Greenburgh. Success attended him from the very start. He had a plausible manner, was a great and adroit flatterer, a regular attendant at the village church, and the old men said he was a " wonderful honest young lawyer," while the young girls and old ,liLe, ex- claimed, that he waq "' a wonderful nice youngman." With two such forces in his favor, his success could be no marvel. The   quality of his honesty and niceness was not discovered until many years afterwards, when it was too late for his career of pros- perity to be checked, for he had then near- ly half the county in his power, and wealth to back the stability of that power. In the very beginning of his career he exhibited a small specimen of his cuteness by marrying the daughter of one of the wealthiest families in the county. She was of the same tastes and disposition with himself, and possessed much of his own keenness, and thus thinking and acting to- gether, with one heart and soul, abund- ant wealth was the result before either had attained the age of fifty years. Prior to the time when we introduce them to the reader, they had only four children, two of whom alone survived more than a month after their birth. With these survivors we have already made the reader acquainted. The kind of legal practice which Hold- fast Sharp adopted for the accumulation of money did not consist in forensic dis- plays at the bar. This did not accord with his chlaractr of mind nor with his ability. Both his talent and his inclination were il a different direction. For the reputation of being a great lawyer he cared nothing, for the reputation of being a very rich man he cared everything. His great aim and practice was, by the machinery and business of the law. of which he was a perfect mas- ter, to et his clients and others together wtih their property, in his power. This in ninety nine cases out of an hundred required not much talking in court, and his first capital once made the rest afterwards became easy -he became what is called by the legal profession an office lawyer. We do not mean to say that he was not ready to, and didnot actually practice in every line of his profession; he did do so, but nevertheless his office was the grand scene of his opera- tions, in some of the grandest of which, as far as nmaking money was concerned, he was never heard of in the open court, how- ever much and painfully he may have been htard of and felt by his victims in their    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6833-00000006"/> homes. In his office he spun a spider's web the ramfications of which extended through all the county, and many were the unfor- tunate flies that fell into the snare. He became the executor of wills which he him- self drew ; the assignee of estates, the as- signments of which he himself drafted, and the property of which he controlled. In all cases he adopted the holdfast principle-he never was known to let go. He bought up mortgages and judgements for the purpose of prosecuting them, and he sold ploperty and took mortgages for it in every case where there was the least possibility of his getting the property again, in addition to the per centage which he always received in cash. The Court of Chancery was his great delight, his weapon of defence and ftlence, for it was a sublime embodiment of the great principle of his father's life and his own-holdfast. At the time we introduce Holdfast Sharp, Esq., to the reader, as he sits in his mansion with his papers in his hand, and Runyon Dooall at the table opposite to him, he has given up almost entirely the practice of the law. lie has grown so wealthy now that it is as much as he wishes to do. to invest his money. He hires an attorney to attend to the business of his office, while he himself employs his whole time in lending money at exorbitant rates of interest on notes or any other good security. In the prosecu- tion of this business Runyon Dooall acts as his runner,- and the tool to do whatever dirty work Holdfast Sharp may not choose to perform himself: Runyon Dooall is ex- actly fitted for his work. There is some mysterious connection between him and Sharp, what it is those who know both par- ties cannot discover. Wherever Holdfast Sharp is, there is also Runyon Dooall. Sharp knows Dooall to be a rascal, and Doo- all has the same knowledge of Sharp-but they trust each other and work together, Sharp growing richer every day, but Dooall remaining the same, always comfortable apparently, but not known to possess any  money of his own. Such were tho pair seated opposite to each   other at the table in the mansion of Hold- fast Sharp. "Dooall," said Sharp, reaching over to him as he spoke, and pointing to a name written on the paper which he held, "Doo- all, bring that man to me to-morrow morn- ing at ten o'clock, I wan't him." Dooall answered with an expressive wink, "Yes, going to put the screws on him, I suppose." "Very probable," was the only reply. At this moment a loud knock on the front door of the house was heard by all in the room. "Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Sharp, " who can that be who knocks soloud. Something must be the matter. Why bless me! there it comes again louder than ever. Some of the neighbors must be sick, or somebody's house must be on fire; bless me! what things servants are, all night coming ;- Dooall, just run to the door, there's a good creature." And Mrs. Sharp tried to look very amiable and patronizing at Dooall. With a slight curve of his lips in the di- rection of Mrs. Sharp, Dooall rose from his seat, but Mr. Sharp interposed with a bland smile in the direction of Mr. Dooall. "No, Dooall," and the expression of the hawk-eye was very soft, on Dooall as he spoke, ' keep your seat, excuse me my dear Mrs. Sharp,-the servant will go to the door in due time, the person can wait, no need of troubling our friend Dooall." Mr. Sharp laid a very flattering emphasis on the word friend. The curve on the lips of Dooall disap- peared as he resumed his seat. The nee- dles of Mrs. Sharp clicked more rapidly for a moment, and from a faint movement in the region of the bottom of her frock, there was evidently a slight disposition on the part of her feet to trot, but she said noth- ing, she never did when Mr. Sharp indica- ted any particular course of action. Mrs. Sharp was a very sharp woman, but Mr. Sharp was more of a General and she knew it. In the meantime, a servant girl had very leisurely made her way to the door,   and opened it. A moment afterwards, the dining room door was also opened, and the servant, who was a tidy looking black girl, appeared in the passage. "Master, there's a beggar woman here that wants to see you." The little hawk-eye of Mr. Sharp was slightly elevated with surprise, as he re- plied  ' Tell her to go off, I've nothing to give." "I did, master, but she won't go." Mr. Sharp deliberately rose from his chair and went to the door. Mrs. Sharp told the girl to take the children to bed, "and then turning to Dooall, remarked that begging was a regular trade, that beggars were coming in droves every day from New York, and that really it was a matter which should be remedied in some way. Mr. Dooall assented to all the remarks of Mrs. Sharp, adding very charitably that beggars were no better than thieves, and should be sent to jail. The light in the hall of the mansion of Holdfast Sharp, Esq., flashed full in the pale face of the woman with the child, whom we left at the end of our first chapter knocking at the door. Her look and the imploring tones of her voice were piteous to behold and hear. "Food and shelter for this night for the sake of my child I beg, I pray you, I am fainting, dying," was the simple but sad appeal. Like a statue of stone Holdfast Sharp, with his hands in his pockets, stood before the suppliant, and his hawk-eyes looked down upon her with as cold and blank a stare as if they were only well shaped eyes of glass fixed tightly in his head. ' My good woman, just one half of a mile beyond this is the Poor-House. It is a large, square, stone building three stories high with three rows of windows in front;   go straight ahead, you can't miss it, you I can get there before the moon sets; go quick now and you will be taken care of, they are paid for doing such business." And Holdfast Sharp, as he thus spoke, shut the door in the woman's face. The wanderer raised her face, pale as death, to Heaven, and pressing her child closer to her breast went onward again in the moonlight. Slower and slower grows her step, whiter and whiter her check, but keep up thy courage and thX heart, poor sinning, suffering woman, for see, as the moon sinks behind the horizon, there looms up in the dark shadows a large, square, stone build- ing with three rows of windows in front-it is the County Poor-House, there they will take care of you and your child i Holdfast Sharp has said it. There is a high stone fence in front of the County Poor-House, and within the fence is a garden full of flowers. The County Poor-House is very pretty outside. The mother with her child reaches the fence, she opens with difficulty the gate, and stands within the flowery garden. She takes a step forward through the flowers and on the gravelled walk, but suddenly she stops, a purple stream gushes from her mouth and nostrils, she throws her arms wildly upward, the child drops into a bed of flowers at her feet, with a low moan she sinks beside it, and then all is silent save the sharp cry of an infant rising clear and distinct on the hushed air of the night. The sufferings of the sinning mother are ended; the fountains of her life, overcharged I with agony and despair, have burst, and she is dead-dead on a bed of flowers at the threshold of the Poor-House, to which the voice of her orphan child of shame is call- ing, in the darkness of the night, for admit- tance and shelter.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6833-00000007"/> CHAPTER III.   A DISCOURSE ON POVERTY-AND A JURY ON DEATH. "Poverty is a nat'ral sarcumstance as is likewise riches, them's my sentiments, Mr. Lanky, and I'm sure I ought to know. Its my bziness to know the difference 'tween them what has got money and them what has not." The above oracular proposition was ad- dressed by Joshua Bull, Captain iu the Mi- litia and keeper of the County Poor House, to Ephraim Lanky, district schoolmaster of Greenburgh. Captain Bull, or Captain Josh Bull as he was generally called, was a bur- ly, heavy featured man with a very red face and eyes somewhat blood-shot. Ephraim Lanky was in person directly the contrary, tall and thin, and branching off at a very great height into a head. Ephraim was, in fact, all head, as far as extent of bulk was concerned. The head, however, although there was a surplus of skull, was not a hand- some head-the face was very pale, the cheek bones high, the nose large ant' irregu- lar, and the forehead receding. Ephraim taught school in winter, and hired himself out to the farmers in summer to work in the hay and harvest field. During his school terms he boarded by turns with his patrons, and he was now boarding out his last month with Captain Josh Bull, who patronised him to the extent of two of the worst boys in the town of Greenburgh. It was about ten o'clock at night when Captain Joshua Bull addressed his sage re- mark to Ephraim Lanky on the subject of riches, and poverty. Captain Josh, when he finished his sentence, finished also his sixth glass of beer, and placing the glass back on   the table by which he and the schoolmaster were seated, and putting his pipe in his mouth, looked over towards his companion for a reply. '-It strikes me," said the schoolmaster, that poverty is directly the opposite of being natural, however, one may naturally like riches. Poverty, I take it, Captain Bull, is very unnatural," and Ephraim Lanky looked as if he felt as he spoke. "I am willing to argify that pint with you, Mr. Lanky. Your opinion is wrong, in toto, as they say in the debating society. Why it is plain as a nose on a man's face that it is jist as nat'ral for some people to be poor and some rich, as for one man tobe a smart man and another a fool. Its nat'ral in every way; nat'ral to git poor and git rich, and git poor agin,"-and Captain Josh replenished his glass, and invited the schoolmaster to do the same. The school- master accepted, but drank very sparingly. He knew the opinions of Captain Bull on the consumption of beer, or any other arti- cle at his expense, by other people. "Still I cannot see the force of your ar- gument," answered the schoolmaster. "I know that some people are rich and others poor, and that the wheel of fortnne is con- tinually turning, often in the case of the same persons, but still, although I see and hear of such circumstances, I do not see the naturalness of them." "That all comes of your not digging down to the bottom of the concern, and learning the first principles. Now, Mr. Lanky, you are a very good schoolmaster, but no poli- 1 ticianer, now afore you can fix this ques- I tion right you must be a politicianer-I'm   one-go the hull figure for my party, up to the hub-got this sitervation because I did; but as I was saying, you must be a politioianer before you can come at the rights of this ere question, you must know the natur of the United States people, and all other people, and how the governments and laws works on the sarcumstances of the people. Now, in England, they keep the hull money in sartain branches of a family by the law of what they call tailments, and they keep it out of other branches by jist the same contrivance, so you see that some of them families is bound to be poor and some to be rich, and then again the peo- ple as is born poor in England, is kept poor, and them as is born rich keep rich; and so riches and poverty in England, are a nat- 'ral sarcumstance according to law. Now, in these United States, this great and glori- ous republic of freedom, and where the star spangled banner waves the same way over rich and poor, riches and poverty is also a nat'ral sarcumstance of the natur of our glorious institutions and the natur of the people. In this ere country every man, woman and child, has an even start accord- ing to law to get money and keep it, I know they don't come out even, and I suppose you'll say that upsets the hull of my argi- ment, but it don't do no such thing. The way the thing works here is jist this. A smart, driving man, pushes ahead to make money, there's nothing to hinder him, the country is big and growing bigge-, well he does make money and gits rich, then he builds a fine house, gits married and has lots of children, and them ere children won't work, cause you see they is rich and they know it, and the upshot of the hull matter is that when they git their daddy's money, they spend it a frolicking around, and git  poor. And then agin, Mr. Lanky, this ere  people is such a go ahead people, go in with  such a thundering dash to make money, i that they make to-day. bust up to-morrow, 1 and git as poor as Job's turkey, but before i you can say Jack Robinson, they jump up I and at it agin, and before you know it are d agin rich, and so you see in this country it's c   up and down and up agin, jist like that pic- ture of the wheel of fortin in the primer. Therefore I say, Mr. Lanky, that riches is a nat'ral sarcumstance, as is also poverty, paupers come jist as nat'raly as rich men, only there's a great many more of 'em; this Poor-House, Mr. Lanky, is, I'm happy to say, full on 'em." Here Capt, Josh Bull paused in his dis- course from the simple fact that he had talked so long that his throat was dry, and Capt. Bull's organization was such that he could not dilate on any subject when he was thirsty. While Capt. Bull was in the act of re- plenishing his thirst, the schoolmaster sug- gested in a very respectful tone, that his, Capt. Bull's, experience on this subject, par- ticularly on that part of it which related to poverty, must have been very great. Capt. Josh. Bull was evidently pleased with the suggestion of the schoolmaster, for he asked him to fill his glass to the brim, and gave the invitation with so much cordi- ality, that the schoolmaster took him at his word and swallowed a full glass of the bev- erage. A moment afterwards his face slightly flushed and he raised himself up on his seat, in a much warmer and more inter- ested manner than he had before exhibited, to hear what further the keeper of the County Poor-House had to say. "Experience! Mr. Lanky!  I believe you. I've had an awful lot of experience in this ere house," said Captain Bull, and his burly figure swelled as he spoke. "I've had all sorts of folks here, them what was rich once and didn't know what it was to be poor, and them what was born poor and didn't know nothing else. I treated them all alike, if they was them as had been rich once, had seen better days as they called it, and didn't know what poverty was, that is to say, if they didn't know the nature on it, I soon larnt 'em. I let 'em know inno time that a pauper was a pauper and noth- ing else. Lord love your soul, they soon git use to it, tit as mild as lambs and hold down their heads like other poor folks; it comes nat'ral to 'em, jist as I've argifyed,    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6833-00000008"/> for poverty is a nat'ral circumstance, jist the same as is riches. As for them born poor and didn't know nothing else, why then it was nat'ral for 'em to be in a poor-. house, and I knocked and shoved 'em about any way and it was all nat'ral to 'em. Now jist cock up your ear and I'll tell you a story. There was a man that lived jist above here some twenty years ago, what had been a great merchant in New York, made heaps of money and thought he would retire to the place where he was born, build a great house and take it comfortably. Well he done it, and a mighty fine house he built, and mighty fine he made everything about it. He had a wife and one son. The wife was a capsheaf of a woman, kind to everybody, but she died soon after the new house was finished. The son was a regular roarer, there want nothing that boy want up to ; his daddy give him a first-rate edi- cation, but it want no use, some folks thought the edication made him worse, made him cute like in cutting up all sorts of shines. Well when he got to be a man all the odds was that he was worse than he was afore. He drank and he gambled and he was mighty gay I tell you among the women. Well, you see all this couldn't be done without money. His daddy shelled out and shelled out, but it want no use, if he got him out of one scrape he was sure to git into another. Well it went on year after year, until one day his daddy, being over excited like about something his son done, fell down dead as a door nail, in a fit. When they came to settle up his estate they found he want worth nothing; cause why, he had spent it all for that ere son of his. So the son had to tramp away from the fine house, and he went the Lord knows where. He staid away some years and then come back a broken down old fellow, but as proud as Lucifer, ugly pride I called it; he wouldn't work and nobody cared anything about him, so he was obleeged at last to come to the poor-house. Such another pauper I never did see; nothing was good enough for him, he stuck up his nose at the vituals, and told me, Captain   Joshua Bull, not to be quite so familiar with him. I soon brought that ere fellow to his bearings. I licked, that ere fellow, I did. He said he'd complain; I told him to do it for nobody cared. He did com- plain, but I was right in more ways than one and he got by his complaint what the  paddy shot at, jist nothing at all. He died at last and the county got rid of the worst pauper I ever see. I've had some paupers here that would make a common man cry, but I didn't, I never cry, it wont do in my bizness. I've had some paupers that had worked hard all the days of their life and yet come to the poor-house. Now a com- mon man would have gone out of his way to make such paupers a leetle more com- fortably than the law allows. I never did, never do, for it wont do, there's only one way to keep a poor-house in order, treat 'em all alike and give 'em jist what the law allows and not a bit more, and not make yourself too bizzy about what the law does allow for fear of raising the taxes. But hark didn't you hear something cry, out in the yard there?" Capt. Bull paused in his discourse and he and the schoolmaster bent forward to listen. A cry in the yard was distinctly heard. "It sounds like that of a baby," said Capt. Bull going to the door and opening it.- "Heavens and earth! Lanky!" he con- tinued, *' come out here; something terrible has happened, there's a dead woman out there as sure as you're alive?" A moment afterwards, Capt. Bull and the schoolmaster were beside the body of the woman whom we left dead by the bed of' flowers in the yard of the Poor-House. While the schoolmaster took the crying in- fant in his arms, Capt. Bull raised the body t of the woman. He saw in a moment that life had departed. By this time the cries of the infant had roused some other inmates of the house, and ill a short time the whole establishment was in commotion. It was with difficulty that Capt. Bull could keep anything like order. The woman was finally laid on a board in the hall, the child given in charge to one of   the paupers who officiated as general nurse to the establishment, and Capt. Bull hast- ened to the house of Holdfast Sharp, Esq., to take his advice in the matter. In answer to the summons of Capt. Bull, Holdfast Sharp, Esq., rose very unwillingly from his bed, and after hearing all the par- ticulars, said he presumed it was the same woman with a child that he had sent up to the Poor-House some hours before, and that as she was dead, nothing could be done before morning, but that perhaps it would be better for the Captain to go after the Doctor, and proceed no further in the affair until morning. Capt. Bull followed the lawyer's advice. With the morning came the usual forms followed on such occasions. A Coroner's Jury was summoned, Holdfast Sharp, Esq., gave in evidence what he knew concerning, the woman, the Doctor testified to his en- deavoring in vain to restore animation, and his belief that the woman died in conse- quence of the bursting of a blood vessel. Capt. Bull and the schoolmaster testified to finding and searching the body, and that nothing was discovered either on the per-' son of the woman or the child, which could   lead to the least conjecture who the woman was or where she came from. The only clues that might possibly lead to some dis- covery at some future time, was a very pe- culiar natural mark on the woman's left arm, and a similar one on that of the child. I There were also the initials E. M., embroid- ered on a handkerchief in the pocket of the woman's dress. The Jury rendered a verdict according to the above circumstances, and the body was put in a pine coffin and buried in the pau- per's grave yard. "What name are you going to give that brat of a girl?" said Capt. Josh Bull, a day after the funeral, to the nurse of the Poor- House, who was fondling in her arms the buried woman's child. "The letters on the mother's handker- vhief are E. M.." answered the nurse, who was a kind creature and had been somewhat poetical in her younger days, "the child was found in the evening and Eva would be a good first name, it is the month of May, and May will be a good last name." And the foundling of the Poor-House was called EvA MAY.    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6833-00000009"/> CHAPTER IV.   THE PAUPER AND HER ANGEL.    C THE occurrence of any event but of the  ordinary monotony peculiar to life in the e country, although it may be of very small t importance in itself, is always enough to t cause a great degree of excitement in a / country town. When, however, the event  happens to be of the extraordinary character  of that recorded in our last chapter, the ex-  citement swells into a torrent of wonder 1 and curiosity, which rushes towards, and u centres in, one spot, with such a raging cur- 1 rent of confluent streams that the sound  thereof is heard far and near. Even when this torrent of excitement reaches its height and subsides, it does not, in the country, as in the hot and absorbing atmosphere of the  crowded life of a city, sink into the ground and disappear; on the contrary it separates itself into numberless little streams which flow back gently in every direction over the country from whence they came, and form, at every door, inexhaustible wells of marvel, on which both youth and age draw, without stint, for a story to enliven the fire- side circle during the evening haurs of the long winter nights. Thus it was in the case of the dead moth- er and the living child found at the threshold of the County Poor-House in the town of Greenburgh. The excitement for some time after the holding the inquest, was great throughout all the country, but it finally died away and resolved itself into a won- derful tale to be told for years at all the firesides around the region where it occur- red, and told with new additions and vari- ations as time progressed. Strange to say, that with all the commotion which the event   caused, and with all the memory of it which remained after the commotion was ovex, no effort was made to unravel the mystery of the affair. The old cloak, the bonnet and the handkerchief of the mother were laid aside in some corner as the sole inheritance of the child, while the little foundling her- self, Eva May, with no kind heart, in all the abodes of wealth where her story had pene- trated. to interest itself in her behalf, was left to the training of the Poor-House, and to the tender mercies of its keeper, Capt. Josh Bull. Time rolls on, and Capt. Josh Bull still rules the Poor-House, and the infant Eva May becomes a pale, thin, sickly looking child, with a slattern dress poor in material and scanty in make, and with feet bare du- ring the half the year. But the large black eye of her mother, full of slumbering intel- ligence and fire, gleams out from a wild mass of raven hair which falls, wavy and silken but tangled and uncombed, down over face and neck and shoulders, and the pale-faced girl even in her Poor-House garb and with her wan featui es, seems beautiful. The limbs of little Eva are weak,very weak, but up the stony and steep path which leads from the spring to the Poor-House, she is compelled to bring the heavy pails of water, and she struggles and totters along as well she is able, but she will sometimes stumble and fall, and then the shrill, sharp, scolding voice of Capt. Josh Bull's wife, Betsey, as with face red with anger she stands in the doorway, falls upon Eva's ear, causing her to spring up with terror, for she knows the weight of the great red hand which is ready t to descend with heavy blows on her head.   The water pails and the falls on the stony path and the heavy blows of Betsey Bull's hands are not all the sum of Eva's misery; there is the bringing in the sticks of wood, and the heavy baskets of chips, under the load of which she can scarcely stand, there is the ceaseless trot of her weary little feet all the day long fron morning until night, now here, now there, waiting on scolding Mrs. Bull, or her rough husband Josh Bull, and their savage sons Jim and Ned, and there are blows from all. And the body of the little Eva grows weaker every day, is in danger of being dwarfed even in the spring-time of its existence, when it should expand into strength and size; and in the mind of the little Eva there i. darkuess. Is there no light in the Poor-House for Eva? Yes a faint glimmer, Ephraim Lan- 'ky still comes to the Poor-House in the last month of his winter school term, and he is Eva's friend. The heart of Ephraim Lanky is in the right place although his figure is ungainly aud his immense head is a crown of deformity to that figure which it is not pleasant to look upon. The friendship oft Ephraim, the only gool thing that Eva knows, she has heard the minister once or wicc when he came to preach at the poor-' house, speak of the good which comes down from the skies, but she has experienced no good hut Ephraim. The kind nurse, who gave to her a name and took care of her in infancy, died and was buried in the pauper's grave, just when Eva b,;au to \wavk, a:nd the first thing she distinctly remembers is Ephraim in his little room, way up in the top-story of the Poor-House, holding her on his lap and telling her about her mother, and bidding her to be a good girl. Capt. Josh Bull and his wife Betsey do not see Ephraim with the pauper child in his lap, or they wonld laugh coarsely, or what is more likely. angrily tell him to drop the pauper brat, and try and find some better business than to fondle and teach it. That litle rcom. in thf top story of the Poor-House, in the last nmona of the winter school term, becomes Eva's Heaven, and Ephraim Lanky is her angel. Few are,   the moments which she has for her Heaven  or her angel-only when her hard task- master and mistress send her to her bed, and when she can snatch a half hour from' the sleep for which her eyes and limbs are already aching. But the voice of Ephraim, although far from a musical one, is yet har- moay enough for her to arrest the heavy eyelid in its leaden close, and to cause the large black eye to look up with wonder and with love into the face of Ephraim, as he tells her again and again the story of her mother's death, or to be strained with eager gaze on the letters of the little primer which he teaches her to read.  "Did my mother when she was a little girl, live in a great stone poor-house, and did they beat her and make her tired V" says Eva. "Alas, my poor child, I know not," and the rough voice of Ephraim is broken as he answers, "Most likely her father and  mother were rich, lived in a fine house and were kind to their little girl, and every one else was'kind to her, for all are kind to the rich." Ephraim is not very skilful in his answer, but his heart is big with pity for the foundling and he thinks that such an answer will make her feel happy. Oh, schloolmalster, how nice it must have been," says Eva, her eyes dancing with joy. "But, schoolmaster, how does rich people's houses look?" Poor Ephraim, his own acquaintance with richi people's houses is extremely limited; but even the incongruous picture of the abode of wealth which he draws before the mind of Eva causes her to clap her little hands and to wish that she could live in such an one. "But, schoolmaster," says Eva again, and her eyes become sad and downcast as she speaks, "who was my father? how queer they never heard of him; wont he ever come here, schoolmaster? shall I never have a father to take me away from this great stone house where they beat and scold ml1e and make me tired? schoolmaster, wont you let me call you father? you're kind to me. I do call you father to myself when I    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6833-00000010"/> am running about for those ugly people 1 down stairs, and when sometimes I can get f away into the woods alone and talk to the 1 trees and the flowers."        f Down the 'bony and sallow cheek of I Ephraim there rolls a big tear, and he lays c his long bony han don the head of the child, s tells her to kneel down leside him and say t after him Our FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN. And Eva kneels and repeats after the c schoolmaster the Lords Prayer. Then tfe I poor schoolmaster kisses the little pauper i and a moment afterwards she is on her bed  of straw, sleeping a sweet and dreamless sleep even under the roof of the great stone  poor-house. But Ephraim Lanky is not al- ways at the poor-house to give to the little pauper her heaven and her angel. Such was the rearing of Eva May in the 1 County Poor-House, in the thwn of Green- burgh. When Eva May was about thirteen years old an event occurred which changed the course of her life and formed the second era in her young existence. It happened in the same month of the year as the first eta of her life when she was brought a help- less infant into the poor-house-the month of May. It was near the close of the day. The air was, mild, the sky was without a cloud, the apple trees were in full blossem, and meadow and hill-side covered with a carpet of the greenest and freshest verdure, lay bright and beautiful in the gold and purple light of the setting sun. Captain Josh Bull was sitting in the porch of the poor-house smoking his pipe. Betsy Bull, his wife was standing in the doorway with her arms akimbo, her eyes fixed generally on the long line of sandy road in front of the poor- house,and particularly on the burly, swelling form of her husband in the porch. In the yard, at the open windows, and on the low long benches in front of the poor-house were to be seen the figures of the old pau- pers, some sitting, some standing, some tot- tering along the gravelled walks, all with shrivelled features and forms bent double with age or disease, and all gazing listless   ly around as they seemed to drink in the fresh air and bathe themselves in the sun- light. Down by the spring a few yards from the house, Eva May was washing some pauper rags, while leaning against a corner of the building stood Ephraim Lanky the schoolmaster, tall, gaunt and awkward, in- tently watching the pauper foundling as with her pale face, slightly flushed by her exertion, she bent herself to her task. The hair of Ephraim Lanky is greyer than it was, but the pity and love in his heart for poor Eva is as green and fresh as ever. "Hey! you there! you Eva May! come open this gate, be quick now you lazy young pauper, or I'll wallop you," cried young Jim Bull, the oldest of Captain Josh Bull's sons, as he drove up a loaded waggon to the side gateway of the poor-house. Eva dropped into the tub the I article she was in the act of washing, and run for the gate. "Faster, you huzzy," screamed Mrs. Betsy Bull, and at that moment Eva, with great effort, and after a trifling delay, swung open the heavy gate. The arms of Eva were not strong and the gate, which was old, had so settled down at. the place where it was fastened that it required to be raised before it could be loosened. "Git up there," yelled Jim Bull to his horses, with a voice more like that of a young savage than a civilized man, as he gave his lash a flourish and dashed through the gate. The lash hit with a shap cut the ' face of Eva. With a low cry she covered her face with her hands and sank down on the ground. Jim Bull when he flourished his long lash might have intended to have hit his horses, he might have intended to hit Eva, perhaps he intended to hit both. e  Ephraim Lanky was watching Jim Bull, v and from the devil that he saw plainly in Jim Bull's eye, he settled the question in - his own mind that Jim Bull meant to hit - Eva May. It was not the firsttime by many a score that he had seen Jim Bull perform a similar manly act. He had often interfered before when he had seen Eva ill-used both   by the parents and the sons, but his inter- ference had been either a subdued remon- strance or a sort, of half petition that they would spare the foundling. Ephraim Lanky was but a poor schoolmaster. Captain Josh Bull was keeper of the poor-house, a great politician and had money, and, therefore, from the knowledge and fear that Captain Bull could and probably would harm him in more ways than one, Ephraim Lankyhad hitherto restrained his hands in endeavor- ing to protect the defenceless Eva. But now the cup was full; that 6ruel cut across the face of Eva caused the blood to tingle in Ephraim Lanky's veins, his hands twitch- ed nervously at his side; there was a fearful light in his big white eyes as they swelled out and glared from beneath the shaggy brows of his mountain of head, and his long legs, with strides like those of the man with the seven league boots, swept over the ground in the direction of Jim Bull. The next moment a long arm, like a bar of iron, reached up into the waggon, a hand, like a vice, grasped the back of the neck of Jim Bull, and down over the wheel and flat on the ground he wrs dragged with a swiftness and force of descent which made the stars fairly dance before his eyes. In vain he kicked and squirmed and yelled; over him and around him was the gaunt form of the schoolmaster bent double like a hoop, with one arm holding him down and with the other raining on him blows, as thick, as fast, and as sweeping in their circuit as those which fall from the long and swinging flail down on the threshing floor. "Wretch, viper, savage cub of a brute of a father, strike with a lash a poor helpless pauper foundling without father or mother, will you? Take that and that and that,"' muttered the schoolmaster between his clenched teeth, and at every word he dealt a blow that seemed to send the breath out of Jim Bull's body. When the lash fell across the face of Eva, it attracted not the slightest notice from Capt. Josh Bull. Although his eye took in the whole scene, he kept on quietly smoking,   his pipe asif nothing had occurred which called for his interference, or which was of sufficient importance to disturb the serenity which he was enjoying. Doubtless his seren- ity was increased to a higher degree of en- joyment by the pain which he saw wantonly inflicted on Eva by his brute of a son. It was consonant with the nature of Capt. Josh Bull, that the affair should afford him the most intense gratification, which he could best feel by calmly looking on the whole performance, in' order that he might not lose the smallest part. Mrs. Josh Ball, with her arms akimbo, seemed not less se- renely satisfied than her husband. Without taking down her arms, she shouted in her shrillest tones: "Sarved yer right, yer lazy huzzy, for not gitting out of the way; shut up yer crying now, and come in here, yer good for nothing pauper brat." When, however, Capt. Josh Bull and his worthy spouse saw the fire in Ephraim Lan- ky's eyes and marked his enormous strides in the direction of their darling son, their serenity received a shock which caused the pipe of the husband to fall and the arms of the wife to drop, and also incited, on the part both of husband and wife, a hot pursuit after the avenging schoolmaster. By the time Mr. and Mrs. Josh Bull reached the scene of action, the schoolmaster had fin- ished his work, and with his arms crossed was looking down with contempt on his prostrate foe, who, with his head slightly raised from the extremely flat position into which the schoolmaster had knocked it, was holding, with all the might of his hand, his nose, in order that no more of the purple c'trrent of his blood might flow from it upon the soil which it had just been so inglori- ously kissing. "Ephraim Lanky 1" shrieked Mrs. Josh Bull, "I'll tear your eyes out," and she sprang like a she-dragon, with all her claws spread, upon the schoolmaster. "Villain!" roared Capt. Josh Bull, as he flung off his coat, and squared himself off for a blow,  I'll let you know what it is to    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6833-00000011"/> take a pauper's part sand strike the son of fe Capt. Joshua Bull," and with the words he t sent his brawny list with tremendous force full on the temple of Ephraim Lanky. m The massive head of Ephraim Lanky was ee a block of marble to the fist of Capt. Josh p Bull, while his gaunt body, which was as m high as she could reach, did not present c] available surface enough for any profitable h hold by the clutches of Mrs. Ball. Ephraim b Lanky, therefore, stood unharmed either by g clutches or by fist. With a slight twist and g shove, he threw off the grasp of Mrs. Bull, for an instant his long arm rose in the air  like an immense lever, was drawn quickly e back, and then, as if it had been a batter-  ing ram of the ancient Romans, forward it a went full between the eyes of Capt. Joshua  Bull. The fight was over; Capt. Bullfell like 1 a log to the ground; his wife with a scream l of terror flew to his side; young Jim Bull, E forgetting his nose and bruises, jumped to c his feet and then clung with affright to one  of the wheels of the waggon; Eva May for-  got her pain, ran trembling up to the school- master, embraced his knees, looked up into  his face as she might have looked into the  face of a Guardian Angel, and asked him to' spare her enemies The paupers at the windows and in the yard, who had witnessed the whole scene, clapped their hands and gave as loud a cheer as age and infirmity could raise. for the champion of the pauper foundling; while towering above all, stood Ephraim Lanky, his face flushed and his eyes gleaming with a righteous indignation, and his ungainly figure and deformed head wearing a look even of sublimity because by the strength of his arm he had so fear- lessly made that indignation felt. Capt. Josh Bull, although stunned by the blow which he had received, was by no means dead. Ephraim Lanky knew this, and therefore surveyed his fallen foe with the greatest calmness. A moment had scarcely passed, when the broad breast of Capt. Bull began to heave, and soon after- wards. assisted by his wife, he regained his   feet. Turning a scowling look of maligni- ty on the schoolmaster, he said: Ephraim Lanky, I owe you, and blast me if I don't pay you with compound inter- est, the sooner now you leave these ere premises the better, for my bile is up and I might do something ugly. Come, Betsey, clinch that brat and come along into the house, this isn't the last of this day's work by a long short," and Capt. Bull turned to go, while his wife reached forth her hand to grasp the child. "Hold," answered the scholmaster, cov- ering the shrinking Eva with his arm. "Let no one touch this child, she goes with me if I have to beg from door to door for her; and hark you, Capt. Bull, I fear you not, you have yourself let me into some of your secrets in the management of this poor-  house, and I have found out others for my- ' self. You say truly that this is not the last ' of this day's work, you'll hear more of it and me depend upon it. Good bye, God ' bless the poor under your management for ' they need it." As the sclioolmaster spoke, he took the hand of Eva, and without giving one look behind led her slowly out of the ) poor-house gate. On the red welt, left on e Eva's cheek by the cutting lash, there glit- tered a tear drop, but she felt no pain, for she was walking beside her Angel. In the meantime, Capt. Bull, his look Of d hate changed somewhat into one of anxiety, walked with his wife and son into the poor- house. The paupers expected an outhreak of passion, but there was none. Ephraim e Lanky's last words troubled Capt. Josh Bull, e and the bull within him was, for the time being, somewhat tamed. e That night Eva and the schoolmaster ,o lodged with a kind, although not a rich s, farmer, who agreed to take Eva and board ;h 'her for a short time until the schoolmaster 4d could find for her a permanent place. Eva, of that night, notwithstanding the pain in her r- cheek, was very happy-her Angel had is found for her a place of re t.   CHAPTER V.   A MODEL FBIEND OF THE POOR. ErPHAIM LANKY kept faithfully the warning promise which he made to Captain Josh Bull on the night when he interfered so manfully in behalf of Eva May, and took her from the Poor House. His sympathies for the ill-treated child were now thor- oughly aroused, and he followed up the personal chastisement which he had inflic- ted on Captain Josh Bull and his son, by laying immediately before the Superin- tendents of the Poor a formal complaint against Captain Bull, in which he set forth that the latter individual had brutally trea- ted not only the foundling Eva, but also all the poor committed to his keeping, that he had been in the habit of giving to the paupers food inferior in its quality to that with which he had charged the County, and for which he had been duly paid; that the quantity of the food supplied had been far less than appeared by the said bills against the County, ar that he was, in fact, in ev- ery way unworthy of being the keeper of the Poor House. So prompt was Ephraim' Lanky in his proceedings, and so ready, were the Superintendents of the Poor to exhibit their willingness to discharge their duty in the affair, that within twenty-four hours after Eva left the Poor House, Cap- tain Joshua Bull heard from Ephraim Lanky, in the shape of a notice from the  Superintendents of the Poor, to the effect, that on an appointed day they would be present at the Poor House and proceed to investigate certain charges against Capt. Bull, touching his treatment of the paupers of the County, aud his general management of the affairs of the County Poor-House.   Capt. Josh Bull trembled when he read the missive sent to him by the Superinten- dents of the Poor, During the many years he had held his office, there had been fre- quent complaints, but they had never be- fore been particularly noticed by the Super- intendents, and the present movement there- fore, looked ominous-looked as if the Su- perintendents thought the present charges had such good foundation in truth, that they could not be passed over slightly even by political partisanship. "Josh," said Mrs. Bull, who had atten- tively watched her husband as he read the note " why, what on arth is the matter with you? you look as if you was scart to death, for gracioussake let me look at that paper;" and rising from her chair, she snatched the note from her husband's hands, and read it over carefully. When she had finished, she threw it down on the floor, placed her arms as usual, akimbo, and looking full in Capt. Bull's face, she continued- "Well, Josh Bull, if you let such a thing as that ere, scare you, you're a bigger cow- ard than I ever thought you was. Why, who cares, let 'em come, and let Eph. Lanky swear till he's blind ; all you've got to do is to keep a stiff upper lip, give the paupers good feed from now till the day of 'zamina- tion, and hire that old devil of a lawyer, Holdfast Sharp, and you'll get along well enough. Pshaw I its nothing." "I rayther think, Betsy," answered Capt. Bull," that you'll find it considerable, for I reckin we live in some such sort of a thing as I once heerd a speaker in County meet- ing call glass houses, and that it would not take fmar bit stuns to break it. Eph-    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6833-00000012"/> Lanky, between you and I, has got a pretty I d big stun to send agin it, and I own I am s a leetle afeerd on it, but howsomever I'll t take your advice, feed up the paupers for once in my life, and be civil to them, and p hire Holdfast Sharp. Perhaps the blasted r pauperswill swear strong enough for me e on full stomachs, and if Holdfast Sharp can't s talk and manage strong enough to git me a out of this scrape, then the devil himself t can't help me." "That's the talk, old man, pluck up, never  say die, ain't you a politicianer, and don't all politicianers live in glass houses?-  Let 'em throw stuns; two can play at that game, and stuns can be throwed backards and forards-let 'em sling any here if they dare; as for Eph. Lanky, the long-legged  varmint, take thelaw on him for 'salt and battery, for he battered you awful, Josh, that I'll swear to." Capt. Josh Bull rather winced at the last observation of his wife ; but recovering his composure and hisusual bull-dog expression of countenance, he left the house and pro- ceeded towards the office of Holdfast Sharp, Esq. A week passed on-such a week as the oldest pauper in the Poor-House had never before known. The food was excellent, Capt; Bull and his wife were not only civil but actually kind. If the Heavens had opened and rained down manna on the Poor-House, the paupers could not have been more as- tonished than they were. It was the third day after this new order of things commenced, that an old pauper, almost drawn double by the rheumatism, sidled up to a brother pauper equally as old as himself, and whose head shook with pal- sy, and whispered with a chuckle in his ear. "It's my belief, Isaac, that the school- master has bin complaining to the Superin- tendents, and that old Bull is only stuffing us to swear for him; how are you going to swear, Isaac?9 "Swear," answered the other, and the anger that seemed to swell within him made his palsied head shake still more fearfully as he spoke," Swear? swear that the old   devil has treated and fed us like dogs, I'll swear the truth to be sure, and that's enough to blast him, God knows." A general consultation among the pau- pers, held, however, in so guarded a manr ner that Capt. Bull did not notice it, follow- ed, and it was resolved that the paupers should act in such a way, that Capt. Bull would be led to think that they swallowed the bait, were highly delighted with his kindness, and were friends to be relied upon in any emergency. The day before the investigation, Capt. Bull, when dinner was over, rapped his knife on the table to call the attention of the paupers, and rising from his chair, with as much blandness in his manner as he could command, he made a speech. "My friends," he said, with an em- phasis on the word friends as if he would atone for the numberless times he had addressed them as paupers, "My friends, poverty as I've often said to the Superin- tendents of the Poor of this county-pov- erty is an awful misfortin and there's no telling who of us may come to it, and there- fore them as is poor and are obleeged to go to the Poor House, ought to be well taken r care of. I've over and over agin, my friends, put this ere fact of the awfulness of poverty, I in such a persuading way afore the Superin- tendents, that they have been obleeged, owing to the very justice of the thing, to * let me do a hundred things for your com- fort which they'd a bin fur enough from r doing if I hadn't talked 'em into it. The ,'Superintendents of this ere county is keen , ones I tell you, and they like poor folks 'just about as much as they like skunks, -Now, my friends, you might sometimes , thought me keen and hash in the way I've - managed this ere establishment, but bless. - your souls, if I'd a bin half as keen and g hash as they'd liked to have had me I should o have been ahyena. You ought to see thei ere Superintendents when I take in my bills e for feed and clothes, why they higgle over e the smallest thing that looks like giving a y pauper the least bit of comfort. Now some d on you has afore this complained of me to   the Superintendents, cause I didn't give you good enough vittals as you thought; well, you got no satisfaction if you did com- plain-cause why you see the Superintend- ents were always complaining to me that I give you too good vittals as they thought. So you see who is your true friends, why I've act'lly lost money some years by keep- this Poor House. I know I've been hash in in my words sometimes to some on you, and I've once or twice hit some on you, but I didn't mean it, we're all mortal as the preacher says, and folks will sometimes git riled and do what they hadn't ought to, but you must forgit and forgive. As I told my wife Betsey yisterday, I mean hereafter to be more careful how I hurt poor folk's feel- ings, and I mean to git vittals as good as I can git 'em if they're to be had for money, and if the Superintendents grumble, I'm going to electioneer to have 'em turned out of office and new ones elapped in their place, jist such sort of men as can feel for the poor, and wont care a fig how much the taxes is .'iz so long as the poor shall be well seen to--een to in jist the manner as they ought to be seen to in a free and enlighten- ed country vhere all men are equal and the poor is jist ab good as the rich. My friends I've only got one word more to say, and skersely think it worth while to say it, only that you might think strange if I didn't mention it aforehand. You see that Eph Lanky, the schoolmaster; whom I've always been so kind to, because I hit him the other day, has bin and complained to the Super- intendents about my beating that little gal and starving you. Now you all saw the hull affair, it was nothing after all, my son Jim didn't mean to hit the gal, and if that gal was back here to-day, I'd treat her like my own darter. Well, the Superintendents are coming here to-morrow to look into the bizness, and I reckon they'll examine some on you, and I'll leave it to you all whether you'll try to swear him as is your friend out of this sitivation or not. You kin go fur- ther,'git a new man to keep this ere Poor- House and fare worse now, mark ty words. What sort of a man, if they turn me out, do   iyou guess the Superintendents will clap in my place? Some fellow you may be sar- tain that will bring in smaller bills than I do; and if smaller bills are made out agih the county than I make out for your feed and clothes, what sort of feed and what sort of clothes do you guess you stand a chance  of gitting? My Friends, I trust my karac- ter in your hands to-morrow, when the Su- perintendents will be poking all sorts of questions at you," and Capt. Josh Bull here wiped the perspiration from his forehead and took his seat amid a cheer from the paupers, in which all the notes of the gamut were fully represented, from the double base to the triple alto, intermixed with a shrill treble as if the gamut itself had been suddenly split into pieces. Capt. Josh Bull, regarding the cheer with which the paupers greeted his speech as a tribute to the power of his eloquence, and an assent to all that he had said, left the room with a feeling of satisfaction that he had not experienced for many days. Had he seen the paupers a few moments after his departure, his satisfaction would not have been so complete-there was unmis- takable evidence in every pauper face, that the owner of the face would, on the mor- row, if he should get a chance, do all in his power to raise a storm about the head of Captain Josh Bull, the keeper of the Coun- ty Poor House. The morrow, thc day appointed for the investigation, came and with it came the Superintendents of the Poor, to the Coun- ty Poor House. Captain Josh Bull and his wife, dressed in their best, received them with smiles and with a cheerfulness that seemed to court an examination into their conduct. The dining-room of the Poor House was the place appointed for the t Court, and the Superintendents when they entered, found it already crowded. There sat Holdfast Sharp Fsq., with his hawk-eye and Runyon Dooall with his cat-eye; there sat Ephraim Lanky with his massive head erect and his look solemn and determined, and by his knees, looking now confidently up into lis face, and now half tremblingly    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6833-00000013"/> around her, stood Eva May,while all around, je some standing and some sitting, were the y most able-bodied of the paupers, whom a Captain Josh Bull had detailed for the oc- h casion. "; Now gentlemen," said a hale, benevo- lent looking farmer, who appeared to be tl the Foreman of the Superintendents. "Now  gentlemen let us proceed to business, this  is a serious affair, we hope friend Bull will come out right, but the matter must be  thoroughly investigated, because the cred- G it of the County and humanity is concerned i in it-the cause of the Poor is sacred." The % voice of the Superintendent was mild and  musical, and his eyes beamed as he spoke- e there could be no doubt concerning the  Foreman's goodness of heart and honesty 9 of purpose.             ' At the words of the foreman of the Su-  perintendents, the paupers, one and all, looked at him with surprised gratification, and down many a cheek a tear was seen to fall. Ephraim Lanky's big white eye kin-  died and seemed to send out a blessing on the Foreman's head, but the hawk-eye of Holdfast Sharp glittered wickedly as he fixed it on the Foreman and said: "Mr. Foreman, I think your'e a Judge in this case, and not the counsel for Ephraim Lanky, and I should think, therefore, any remarks calculated to show sympathy either way, are altogether impertinent." "Mr. Hoidfast Sharp," answered the Foreman with dignity, "I am conscious of the rectitude ot my own intentions, and therefore the gross insult you have put up- on me falls harmless at my feet. We are not a court to try a criminal case, or indeed aregular court of any kind, or we would ' end you at once to jail for contempt of court; we are only a Board of Superin- tendents of the Poor, met here to endeavor to find out if possible, whether or not Joshua Bull is a fit person to keep the Poor of this County, and God helping me, as farsas in my power, I will find out, and if you insult me again, I'll find a remedy for myself that you may not possibly like." The hawk-eye dropped-there was a ma- Lt   jesty and power in the Foreman's honest. yet firm look, that awed Holdfast Sharp. and muttering something like an apology, he said that he was ready to commence the investigation. The first witness who was examined was the foundling Eva. She stood timidly be- fore the Superintendents, but the kind voice of the Foreman soon inspired her with con- fidence, and she told the story of the treat- ment which she had received from the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Bull, in so artless and touch- ing a manner, that Lanky; and all present, with the exception of Capt. Bull and his wife, were much affected. Down the wither- ed cheeks of many of the old paupers, the tears fell fast and unrestrained, a big one glittered in the eye of Ephraim Lanky, and the Superintendents themselves, although they strove to conceal their emotion, looked solemn. "Ever since I renember." saidEva, "They beat me and made me tired with work, and ever so many times I've gone to bed hun- gry, way up in the dark garret where the mice run over me, and cried myself asleep. I've never been happy but when the good schoolmaster would come to the House and talk to me at night of Heaven, and give me a big piece of nice cake which he said he got down in the village-they've often beat me black and blue." As here behold the proof," interrupt- ed Ephraim Lanky, regardless whether he was in order or not, and with his long hand almost tearingdown, rather than undoing the back part of Eva's dress. The exposed : back of Eva's person exhibited conclusively the proof of which the schoolmaster spoke I -the marks of heavy blows were on it with t' a distinctiveness not to be mistaken. ' Were you not a naughty girl, when r they whipped you?"  asked Holdfast t Sharp. r  "I've always tried to be good, because s the schoolmaster told me to be so, but f they've beat me all the time and made me r hungry and tired," was the only answer of the child. There not being much to be made by   Holdfast Sharp out of this witness (for she carried with her in her sickly looks and the marks on her person the proof of her testi- mony) he asked no further questions, and Ephraim Lanky was next called to the stand. Ephraim Lanky told his experience of the way in-which Capt. Bull treated Eva, and the paupers generally, in a clear and straightforward manner; and his conviction of the righteousness of the cause ,in which he was engaged and the intensity of his feelings so inspired him that he was really eloquent. He related minutely all the cir- cumstances of the affair of Jim Bull and Eva at the Poor-House gate, and stated without reservation how he had interfered and knocked down both the father and the son. He then recounted the number of times and the occasions when he had, pre viously to the affair at the gate, particu- larly noticed the most cruel and brutal beatings of Eva by Capt. Bull, hiswife, and their sons. He also stated, and brought facts in his own knowledge to prove it, how the child had been half starved, and he de- scribed the miserable accomodations that had been made for her sleeping. He also described the foul and harsh language habitually used by Capt. Bull and his wife to the child and the paupers generally, and how the latter were shoved about and often struck. He also stated the substance of conversations which he had held with Capt. Bull and in which the latter had let him into the secrets of his, Capt. Bnll's, man- agement of the Poor-House. "And as to the kind of food the paupers actually do receive," said Ephraim Lanky, at the conclusion of his testimony, " and for the strong contrast between that food and the food for which the County pays Capt. Joshua Bull, let these papers be the best witness-three of these papers are copies of accounts rendered to Capt. Bull by certain parties, therein named, for provisions fur- nished for the Poor-House during the last six months of last year, and the remaining paper is the copy of an account rendered to you, the Sunerintendents, by Capt. Joshua   Bull for provisions furnished by him to the Poor of the County during the samb period. By comparing the former with the latter you can easily judge for yourselves of the correctness of Capt Joshua Bull, and of the difference between what he pays for and gives to the Poor, and what you pay him for, presuming that the Poor receive the same from him." And Ephraim Lanky, as he spoke, laid several slips of paper on the table. Holdfast Sharp of course objected to the introduction of these papers as evidence, but the Foreman, 'after consulting with his brother Superintendents, overruled the ob- jection, and the papers were xead. The con- trast between the four bills-was as Ephraim Lanky had intimated, very striking. In the bills rendered by his creditors to Capt. Joshua Bull, the main items were Indian meal, some few-very few-barrels of flour, a large quantity of codfish; a few barrels of pork, an extraordinary quantity of molasses, and extremely little milk, sugar and tea.- The bill, rendered to the Superintendentsof the Poor by Capt. Joshua Bull,'was filled with charges for fine white flour, fresh beef, tea, sugar and milk, while the figures, show- ing the consumption of Indian meal, mo- lasses and other common articles, were ex- tremely few and far between. In Capt. Joshua Bull's bill there was also a good round sum charged for wine and other liquors, which the said bill purported had been used for the sick. In cross-examining Ephraim Lanky, Mr. Holdfast Sharp exerted all his legal cute. ness, but it entirely failed. He could not make it apparent that the schoolmaster had any bad or even questionable motives for the course which he had pursued, and he could not in the least shake the credibility of ; Ephraim's testimony, by the impertinent ' questions he put to Ephraim concerning the history of his life from boyhood up, and by which he sought to create the impression that the schoolmaster was rather a worth- less fellow, very poor and very venal, and , whose evidence was not at any rate entitled , to very great consideration. Ephrim swore    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6833-00000014"/> directly that the papers were true copies  made by himself from the original docu- 1 ments, and he took his seat with his evidence tl as unharmed by the outrageous and base as- n saults of Holdfast Sharp's cross-questions, h as his head and body had a few days pre- viously been unharmed by the assaults of fi Mr. Bull's fist and Mrs. Bnll's clutches. e The persons who rendered the bills a against Capt. Bull, whichhad been produced b by Lanky, were next sworn and verified v their correctness. Several farmers in the a neighborhood also were sworn, who testified c to the brutish manner in which they them- s selves had seen Capt. Bull act towards the f paupers, and also to the complaints of his  treatment of them, that the paupers had at various times made to them, the witnesses. 1 Holdfast Sharp uow commenced the de- fence, 2by calling as a witness, a pauper  about fifty years of age, but whose grey hair feeble attenuated frame and features in which deep red blotches contended with wrinkles and a yellow pinched up skin for the mastery, gave to him the appearance of being much older. There was, however, a look of intelligence in his eyes, and the half sad and half dignified manner in which he took the seat prepared for him in front of the Superintendents, produced the impres- slon that he had seen better days, and had once occupied a respectable position in so- ciety. 'Easy, Squire" whispered Capt. Bull in the ear of the lawyer. "Take the cretur easy, Squire-soap him a little as you lawyers say," and Capt. Josh Bull himself looked very uneasy, as if he feared that Sharp's keen manner with the witness, if exercised in its perfection with the witpess, would not much help his, (Capt. Josh Bhll's) cause. With his ear slightly inclined towards Capt. Bull, and his hand spread open be- tween his own and the face of Capt. Bull in order that he might not take the breath of the latter, Holdfast Sharp answered his cli- ent's whisper by merely removing for an instanthis look from the witness to his cli- ent with a stern cold expression which said as plain as words could have spoken it,   "Don't interfere with me sir, I know exact ly what I am about," Capt. Bull understood the look-felt that he was answered, and with his face extremely red he fell back in his seat behind his lawyer. "Now, my good friend," said the lawyer fixing on the witness his hawk-eyes with an expression meant to be remarkably bland, and assuming an impressive carriage of the back towards Capt. Bull, and meant to con- vey to that person that he was thus mild and polite toward the witness, on the motion of his own wisdom and not at the whispered suggestion of Capt. Bull, "Now, my good friend, will you have the goodness to tell your name?" The witness gazed full into the face of the lawyer and answered, "Miles Miller." "How long have you been in the Poor- House?" ' Three years,'long enough, God knows." Holdfast Sharp slightly winced, Capt; Bull winced a little more than Holdfast Sharp, and Mrs. Bull winced more than either. *' Well, my good friend, how has Capt. Bull treated you?" continued the lawyer. "Like a dog," was the answer, and the f words came out full strong and indignant. Capt. Josh Bull jumped from his chair as I if he had been shot; ahd the word "Liar," - in a voice of rage was half uttered, when a violent jerk from his lawyer, and a severe i look from the Foreman of the Superintend- ,ents caused him to smother the rest of the s epithet and resume his seat. 1 Mrs. Josh Bull, with a similar burst of s feeling, was on the point of sending forth i the word "Wretch," with forcible utter- t ance, but seeing, the sudden discomfiture of her husband, she cut the word short by a s convulsive compression of her lips, and re- !- sumed her composure. a  "There now, my good friend Mr. Miller, ,f keep cool, you're rather warm; and answer i- me how has Capt. Joshua treated you like a n dog?" i- "Every way he has fed me and all the d rest of the poor folks in the house like dogs, t, he has-given us beds to sleep on that wepe   not fit for dogs, and he has spoken to us and knocked us about as if we were no better than dogs." Capt. Bull adt his wife, when they heard this answer of the witness, looked at him as if they would have liked, at that particular moment, to have given with their hands on the person of the witness a striking proof of the truth of the witness' words. More and more disconcerted with the character of the testimony which his wit- ness was giving, Holdfast Sharp continued with no great confidence his questions. c"You must be a little more particular, friend Miller," said Sharp. "For instance, do you remember particularly the food which has been furnished to you?"Hold- fast Sharp when he asked this question ex- pected to receive a general answer like the former one given by the witness-he had no idea that the witness could make any other answer but that the food was bad, without bringing forward any series of facts to prove his words. Holdfast Sharp, how- ever, was mistaken. "If I should live fifty years," answered Miller, "I should remember it very partic- ularly, but partly to be sure that I should not forget the items, and partly for amuse- ment to pass away some of the wretched hours of my life, I have kept a memorandum of the breakfast, dinners and teas I have had in this house for the last six months, and and here it is on a slip of paper, and the truth of it is proved by the signature of some dozen other poor folks in this house who have signed their names or made their marks to it." And Miles Miller laid the singular document on the table before the Superintendents. Holdfast Sharp had tried to stop this last answer of the witness, in its progress, but in vain, and he reached hastily over the table for the paper the moment the witness laid it down, saying that he should not al- low that paper to be given in evidence. But it was too late, the Foreman of the Su- perintendents took the paper up, saying that he should require everything which could throw the least light on the case, and   I he desired that the counsel would proceed, Holdfast Sharp answered that he had no more questions to ask; and as Ephraim ' Lanky, satisfied with the proof already ta- s ken, would make no remarks to sustain the r charges further than the testimony sustained them, Holdfast Sharp commenced a speech in favor of Capt. Joshua Bull, the main ar- gument of which was that it was all a base conspiracy, that Ephraim Lanky had tamp- ered with the 'paupers, and that a worthy citizen, one who had taken care of the poor for many years in a manner never before equalled in the county, for humanity and liberality, was about to be sacrificed to spite and malice.  The Superintendents were not long in coming to a conclusion. On comparing the bills rendered to Capt. Bull, and the articles supplied on the table, as set forth in Miles Miller's memorandum they were fonnd to agree, and the fact that they were sold to Capt. Bull at most extraordinary low prices, proved the fact that they were of the dama- ged and inferior quality, also stated in Mil- ler's memorandum-it was poor mush and sour molasses, stale pork and codfish, and bad rye bread from the beginning to the end of the chapter; all of which was very dif- ferent from that for which they, the Superin- tendents, had paid Capt. Joshua Bull. The proof also of his brutal behavior being fully established, the Superintendents an- nounced at once to Capt. Joshua Bull, that he might vacate the Poor House in two weeks from that date. In the meantime, the custody of Eva was given to Ephraim, who said, until he found a place for her to work at service, the farmer with whom she was now staying, was willing to keep her. Capt. Joshua Bull and his wife received the decision of the Superintendents in dog- ged silence. Holdfast Sharp, Esq., with an undisturbed manner, as if he was used to such things, politely took his leave, accom- panied by his shadow, Runyon Dooall, and the Superintendents soon followed. Capt. Bth had calculated wrongly this time on his influence with the Superintendents of ' the Poor. These officers, especially in the    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6833-00000015"/> ural districts of the United States, gene- rally mean to do what is right in regard to the poor; they may for a time be influenced by potitical considerations to retain unwor- thy men as keepers of the poor, but when the cry of the poor is loud for redress, it is heard and answered as it should be. It was  so in this case, as Capt. Bull found to his cost. "I'll be revenged for this," said Capt. Bull to Epnralm Lankey, as the latter left   the Poor House, accompanied by Eva. "I'll be revenged, blast me." The Schoolmaster kept on his way and made no answer. The next day, however, he was arrested on a warrant for assault and battery, on the person of Capt. Joshua Bull. The case was tried and Capt. Joshua Bull received a verdict of six cents for his dama- ges. The day after the verdict was given, Capt. Joshua Bull with his family, left the County Poor House in Greenburgh, and another took his offiee   CHAPTER VI.   EVA An THE BOOKER.  Five years have passed since the events recorded in our last chapter; the little girl Eva has become a full grown woman, with the flush of health and beauty on her cheek, and her form rounded into an outline of grace which even the humble garments she wears cannot disguise. Her black and lux- uriant hair no longer strays in wild and un- combed negligence over her neck and shoulders, but it is neatly arranged, falling in a graceful knot of tresses'behind, and parted over a brow high, commanding, and white as alabaster, beneath which the long siken eyelashes droop with an exquisite pencilling over the dark depths of her large dreamy black eyes, which give forth now no shade of sorrow. The same small, curved line of ruby red, which' marked the lips of her mother, are reproduced in Eva's mouth, and are rivalled in their tint only by the vermillion of her cheeks. Her swan- like neck, and rounded bust, lost in snowy whiteness beneath her modest kerchief, are such as a sculptor would choose for the mo- del of some faultless statue. Ephraim Lanky has kept his word to the foundling; he has found for her a place in a worthy fa- mily of moderate means, not far from the village of Greenburgh, and here she has done the housework, sewed a little, and been content, for the last five years. In her leisure moments she has studied the few books with which Ephraim has supplied her, and with his assistance at stated inter- vals she has acquired the rudiments of knowledge. And with Ephraim's teachings   and her own natural promptings, she has kept her soul pure in her humble lot. "Eva," said a middle-aged man one eve- ning when she was about eighteen years old, "Eva, I wish you would go to New York and live with my wife. It will be better for you to do so; my wife wants a person on whom she can rely, and you are just the one. I have watched you, and I know you -will suit her. I will give you better wages than you get here, and you had better make up your mind to go." Eva cast down her eyes and answered, "You are very kind, sir. I will ask my friend, Ephraim Lanky ; he's a father to me, and what he says I will do. I must also ask the kind people here with whom I have lived so long." The gentleman said no more at the time, and Eva waited for the advice of the schoolmaster. The person who thus addressed Eva was, as we have before said, of middle age; he was portly in appearance, had a rosy, good- natured face, and the only remarkable features which he possessed were a thick, sensual-lookingd,pair of lips, and a double chin. His whole appearance, however, was pleasing, and such as to inspire confidence. His dress was a perfect model of neatness, coat and pantaloons of the finest black cloth, white vest, and a massive gold chain rand seal depending from his watch fob. His name was John Bearem, and he was evidently a man of wealth and position in society. We will look into his history and read a little of his character. I John Bearem was a broker, one of the    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6833-00000016"/> wealthiest brokers in that celebrated loca-  lity of money changers in the city of New  York, called Wall street. John Bearem's  father before him was a broker and banker combined, in the same street; and when,  full fed, portly and sleek, he fell down dead  in a fit of apoplexy, at the head of Wall  street, just under the shadow of Trinity  Church, and when he was not thinking of the church, but of getting into an omnibus and going home to his dinner, then his son i John Bearem, after giving his father a mag- nificent funeral and a sculptured monu-  ment, stepped quietly in his shoes, walked down to Wall street and took his father's place. He filled it worthily. Through the week he gambled in stocks with a devotion, a skill and a morality that would have done credit to that desperate class of adventu- rers who are known by the name of black- legs, and whom the respectable portion of  the community repudiate, and very rightly, with abhorrence. The respectable portion of the community, however, have no repu- diation for a Wall street gambler in stocks, the latter personage being a large 'opera- tor" in monied securities and not a low card shuffler; let him descend to shuffling cards and his respectability sinks at once below zero. It would puzzle a moral phi- losopher to tell the difference between the stock and the card gambler, but society in the present era of the world, as. in many preceding eras, does not proceed on the principles of moral philosophy when it fixes the position of its members-it proceeds only on the principles of looks and money bags. John Bearem, the broker and banker, was not, therefore, repudiated in society for the gambling which he performed during the week; on the contrary, his money bags swelled larger and larger, and his respecta- bility increased in proportion. On Sundays Mr. John Bearem, satisfied with the opera- tions of the week, occupied with the great-  est punctuality one of the best pews in the  most fashionable church in the city, where  the music and the company were unexcep- tionable. The music came principally from   the opera-house, and the company came principally in carriages. The books in John Bearem's pew were bound in purple velvet and gold and were faultless in their appropriateness with the splendor of the church around them. John Bearem him- self was elegantly bound fi fine cloth ashe sat in his pew, and his outward appearance of devotion was also faultless in its appro- priateness with the character of the place in which it was exhibited. John Bearem, therefore, credited himself with two hun- dred per cent profit made from the world for his Sunday performance, and the world acknowledged and paid the debt. And yet with all this, John Bearem was a sensualist in his appetites and a sharper in his busi- ness operations; he checked his passions only on the boundaries where discovery by the world was likely to ensue; he checked the dishonesty of his business op- erations only on the boundaries where it was probable the law would not check it for him. When we introduce John Bearem to the reader, he was the husband of a beautiful, accomplished and amiable wife, to whom he paid the most profound attention when 'the eye of the world was upon him, but whom he most grossly abused when that eye was withdrawn, A few days before he addressed Eva May, as we have above stated, he came to the town of Greenburgh and took board with the humble family with whom Eva lived. His object was a fishing excursion, for the streams around Greenburgh were fa- mous for the fine trout with which they were abundantly filled. Farmer Peter Robinson and his wife were pleased with their board- er and did every thing in their power for his comfort; he paid them well, and this also contributed to establish him more firm- ly in their favor. Eva May also thought him a very amiable person, and with no guile in her own heart, was far from suspect- ing any in a person in his position. Eva, how- ever, knew nothing of the world, did not know it was full of fiends of men in the shape of John Bearems. From the first mo- ment that he entered Peter Robinson's house   and saw Eva May, John Bearem made in his mind a dark resolve with respect to her. He gained her confidence and esteem, and finally, as we have seen made to her a pro- position to go to New York and better her condition by living inlhis family. She treat- ed the proposition, as we have also seen in the same good faith, in which she supposed John Bearem made it. A week passed on, and Ephiaim Lankey, in compliance with the request of Eva May, made her a visit at Farmer Peter Robin- son's.  The hair of Ephraim Lanky was white, and he was still poor and gaining his bread from day to day, by teaching school, when he again stood before the maiden Eva, whom he had protected in her infancy and girl- hood. But age had dealt lightly with Ephraim and his form was still tall, erect and vigorous. "What would you, Eva, with the old Schoolmaster?" he said, as he impressed a pure kiss on her forehead and waited for the reply. ' Yon have been my friend, my father, in the past, I wish your advice for the future. A rich man named John Bearem has ibeen staying here; he came to catch trout in the streams, he wishes to catch me, for he has ofterad to pay me higher wages tha I ever dreamed of getting, ifI will go and live with his wife, Ephraim, my father shall I go?" and Eva smiled, as she looked into Ephraim's face, and in her turn waited for his answer. For a moment the brow of Ephraim was troubled, he looked earnestly at Eva, and tasked, "Eva, do you wish to go?" "Yes," replied Eva, "if you think best, although I feel very sad at the thought of leaving my kind friends here, Mr. Robinson and his good wife. But perhaps, Ephraim," and Eva's eyes filled with tears as she spoke, "perhaps I shall find out something about my father, dont you think it possible?" "Barely," answered the schoolmaster, his own eyes' glistening with emotion, "but it may be; the thing, however, most to be con- sidered now is your own welfare. and I can-   not decide whether it will best for you to go until I see Mr. John Bearem." Ephraim Lanky did see John Bearem, and with the same winning manner by which he had gained the good opinion of the Robinsons and Eva, he won a place in the open and generous heart of the school- master. And Ephraim gave his consent for Eva to go to the house of John Bearem. The reluctant consent of the Robinsons was also obtained, and a day was fixed for Eva's departure. The appointed day came, and Eva's small chest of clothes was strapped on the stage coach and she was ready. John Bearem had returned to the city some days previ- ously, but had left directions that some of his people would meet Eva at the stage coach office, in the Bowery, and bring her, to his house. There was no railroad at the period of which we write, between Green- burgh and the city of New York. "God bless and keep you, Eva," said Ephraim Lanky, laying his hand on the head of Eva-the next moment, with her eyes blinded with her tears, the Foundling of the Poor-House was in the coach and on her way to new scenes, where another im portant era in herlife was to take place. It was a beautiful afternoon in the month of June that Eva May rode in the stage- coach towards the city of New York. The coach was a fine one and well appointed in every particular. It was mounted on easy springs, gaily painted with a bright red color with a broad border of gilt running around the edges of the panels, and with the name "Red Bird" in large gilt letters on each of the doors. There being but six passengers, two only occupied a seat, and all were comfortable. With four strong and handsome horses to draw them over the road, the travellers proceeded on their jour- ney at the rate of about seven miles the hour. Although the parting with Ephraim Lanky and the Robinsons had left a shade of sadness in the breast of Eva May, she was happy-a promising home. was before her, entirely new scenes were at every mo-    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6833-00000017"/> ment spreading out around her as she looked tr from the windows of the coach, the air was s pleasant and refreshing, and the heart of Eva was big and bounding with a thrilling a delight of a kind which she had never before aE experienced. Over the same road where fr eighteen years before, Eva's mother, with p Eva a helpless infant in her arms, walked y on her weary journey, in wretchedness and a despair, the coach now slowly rolled; but ii it did not mar the gladness in the heart of Eva, for she knew it not. She saw not in M imagination her mother toiling through the e heavy sand and over the stony hills; she a saw not in imagination herself falling into the embrace of death at the edge of the D wayside brook under the shadow of the J wood, she saw not the frantic rush of her mother to save her, and she dreamed not of  the damning sin from which that mother  had there been saved.-The sand and the  hills as Eva passed them were to her only  a natural diversity in the scene; and in the  wayside brook, when she looked down upon I it, she saw only a stream of sparkling  beauty, where the waters danced not more joyously than her own heart. The twilight had passed and darkness was falling on the crowded streets of the city of New York, when the Greenburgh stage-coach drove up to the stage-office in the Bowery. Eva, as she alighted from the coach, was bewildered with the confusion and the strangeness of the scene around her. The stage-office was in the rear of the bar-room of a tavern of the lower class, and the loud voices which came from the drinking saloon, and the jostling against her of the crowd on the side-walk, caused Eva to tremble as she stood on the pave- ment waiting for her trunk to be taken from the stage. "Have a carriage, ma'am?" said a rough looking man, in a drab box-coat, enormous pair of whiskers and remarkably red nose, as he gave his whip a snap and laid hold of Eva's shoulder, 'take you any where you please, best coach on the stand, and only charge you a dollar." "No, sir," timidly answered Eva, as   trembling more violently than before, she shrunk from the man's touch. "You'd better," continued the man with a more urgent and impudent tone of voice, as he perceived that she was a stranger from the country; 'you'd better, its getting pitch dark and the lamps aint of no account, you can't find your way. There, jump in and I'll carry you where you want to go in a jiffy-I'll see to your trunk; come." What further he would have said or done was interrupted by a tall negro, well dress ed, and black as jet, who approached Eva and said- "Miss, if your name is Eva May, show me your trunk and follow me. I'm Mr. John Bearem's man." The man with the box coat moved off with a curse on h's lips, and Eva May fol- lowed the negro, who shouldering her trunk proceeded down Walker street until he came to Church street, when he stopped be- fore a large three story brick house which had every appearance of being the abode of a man of wealth. On entering the house Eva was very gra- ciously received by a showily dressed wo- man, with a pleasing countenance and the , manners of a lady. "Follow the servant up stairs to your I room, my child, I suppose you are tired. I'll see you again after tea," said the lady I kindly, and Eva did as she was directed. 1  The room in which Eva found herself was f a small one in the attic story of the house, , with a dormant window opening on the roof. t  She had not been in the room more than i ten minutes, when the door opened and - John Bearem entered. Eva thought his n coming there was strange, and a presenti- ment of evil took possession of her mind. "Where am I, what would you do with s me? Spare me, I am but a poor girl un- ', worthy your notice," wildly exclaimed Af Eva, and shrinking into the corner of the u room. y  "Calm yourself, dear girl," said John Bearem, "I intend you no harm if you are is kind, but I love you 'madly, and you must   be mine,; I'l give you gold, a fine house, all you can wish, make a fine lady of you, only give yourself to me," and John Bear- em advanced, relentless and with the fire of unholy passion in his eye, towards the shrinking Eva. She gave one frantic look around the apartment, and then quick as the light- ning's flash, she sprung through the low dormant window out on the roof, and down on the dizzy edge of the eaves of the house. John Bearem Was struck with horror as, rushing to the window, he leaned his body half way out, and beheld Eva's perilous situation. "One step further to follow me," ex- claimed Eva, "and-I throw myself down, and my blood be upon your head." .As she spoke, she pointed with her hands to the dark depth below, and stood motionless as a statue, with her eyes fixed on John Bear- em. At that moment the moon, breaking from under a cloud, shone down full upon   her; and with her features pale as marble, and animated into an expression of subli- mity by the firm resolve of her soul, she seemed like some priestess of old at the sa- crifice of the altar. ' She had stood thus but an instant when the fire bells rung loud and clear on the night air, and the street was filled with the flying engines and firemen-the next mo- ment John Bearem was pulled forcibly from the window, and the form of a man in a red shirt and fireman's hat occupied his place.  * Eva looked a moment in the stranger's face, saw honesty of purpose written there as with the finger of heaven, and walking firmly along the eaves, she crept a step or two up the steep roof, gave her hand to the fireman with the confidence of a child, and was drawn by him into the room. The Foundling of the Poor House, in another dark hour of her life, had again found a protector.    <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6833-00000018"/> CHAPTER VII.   THE BLEAR-EYED MAN AND THE LAWYER.  We must leave Eva May for a short time r in the hands of the young fireman, and re- a turn to the village of Greenburg. It was f in the early part of an evening, about a h week before the departure of Eva May for o New York and the occurrence of the events f narrated in our last chapter. The day had l been stormy, and as usual at such times, the g bar-room of the tavern at Greenburg exhi-  bited a full quorum of its frequenters, who b came to counteract the damp they had suf-  fered out of doors during the day, by tak- 1 ing something warm within the stomach at night, and also to relieve the gloom of the evening by a little gossip over their glasses. The bar-room of Caleb, or Cale Smith's ta- vern, as it was called, was a small apart- ment with a sanded floor, a rusty stove in the centre, a dozen cane bottom chairs, and one or two pine benches ranged in regular order around, and a square place partition- ed off on one side, with railings down in front, and two shelves behind graced with segar boxes, liquor bottles, and a row of lemons perched upon the top of a row of re- versed glasses, the color of which on the rim was white, but verged into a sickly green at the bottom. Behind this railed dispen- sary of rum, gin, brandy and tobacco, and at an opening formed by the sliding up of a portion of the rails, stood the landlord, Caleb Smith, a man thin in figure, with a pale, hatchet face, his coat off and his shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbow. Caleb Smith differed from most other landlords. From time immemorial landlords have been represented, and with truth, as portly per-   sonages, with figures well rounded as if well filled with the choicest contents of a rich larder, and with countenances as rosy as if the grape bloomed again in its purple freshness on their faces. Caleb Smith, however, was not of this class. The soul of Caleb Smith was so intently fixed on filling his pockets with money, that he paid very little attention either to his stomach or his mouth-he was no generous patronizer of his own bar or larder, simply because he was too stingy-he was thin be- cause he consumed the smallest quantity of the very plainest and coarsest food, and he was a pale-faced, temperate man, because water was cheaper than liquor. It was also doubtless owing to the cheapness of water, that Caleb Smith's liquors were, like him- self, extremely thin. The company in Caleb Smith's room were in the midst of the jingling of their glasses and a loud confused conversation, when a wagcn was heard to drive up to the door, and a moment afterwards a stranger en- tered the apartment. I'll stop here to-night," said the stran- ger in a blunt voice, " and I wish you would see my horse well taken care of." "We'll try and make you comfortable," was the answer of Caleb as he came out of his bar, and went to the door to give the F hostler some directions with regard to his ,guest's horse. The next moment he was behind the rails again, and with a "What t will you have, sir?" and a low bow, he awaited the stranger's answer. "1 Well, it's cursed damp; I guessI'll take ia glass of brandy." The brandy was poured out, and the   stranger draining the glass at a single draught, placed it down on the bar with an emphatic " humph!" and ordering his sup- per to be prepared immediately, he took a seat, and looked composedly and searching- ly around him. As he did so, all eyes were fixed inquiringly on him, as if to discover if possible, who and what he might be. The stranger, however, was a riddle not easily to be read. He was a short, thick-set man, with black, bushy hair brushed up straight in front, like an impenetrable rank of bris- tles; a low forehead, jutting with thick, red- dish eyebrows over a pair of blear eyes which, with a short, snub nose, a pair of thin compressed lips, and cheeks round and red, were almost completely lost within the embrace of an immense pair of red whiskers which nearly touched each other over his whole face. His dress betokened neither wealth or poverty, and his manner although abrupt and rough, was perfectly self-pos- sessed. The stare, which the company in the bar-room had fixed upon the stranger, and which he returned with compound in- terest, was maintained in silence on both- sides, until the object of it was informed by the landlord that his supper was ready. As soon as the stranger had left the room, the jingling of the drinking glasses recom- menced, and tongues began to move more freely. "Well, who on earth can that queer look- ing fellow be?" said the village blacksmith, a man full six feet in height, and whose hands showed but little of their original color under the thick coating of coal dust, with which they were encrusted. "It strikes me,?' answered the village shoemaker, a little stumpy individual who talked through his nose, "it strikes me, that that ere man with the queer eyes has got some business with Lawyer Sharp. I've always took notice that when such out-of- the-way-looking chaps comes along this town, they always have something to do with Lawyer Sharp-that lawyer is a keen one, if he aint I'm blowed i" Further conversation of a similar nature to the above, followed on all sides, and was   continued until the stranger returned into the bar-room. "Now, landlord," said the man with the blear eyes, who had caused so much curiosi- ty on the part of the tavern gossips of Green- burgh. "Now, landlord,just tell me where I'll find Holdfast Sharp, Esq., and I'll be obliged to you 1" "Right across the way, not twenty steps from here, you can't miss it," was the an- swer; and the man with the blear eyes left the tavern and proceeded in the direction indicated. Holdfast Sharp had not yet left his office for the night, and he was alone. Runyon was out oa some Dooall expedition, and the attorney whom he employed had not yet returned from his supper. Being thus alone, Holdfast Sharp, when he heard a loud knock on the door, started slightly  from his chair as if he felt somewhat afraid. Holdfast Sharp was always timid when he was alone at night, owning doubtless to a varietyof recollections which on such oc- casions would flash unpleasantly across his conscience. He instantly, however, recov- ered himself, and in his usual tone of voice said "Come in." Our acquaintance with the blear eves immediately entered and confronted the lawyerfacetoface, with an expression on his countenance which seemed to invite re- cognition on the part of the attorney. The hawk-eye of Sharp, rested uneasily for a moment on the blear eyes of his visitor, then as if he had determined in his mind what course he should adopt, he reached out his hand with an appearance of great cordiality exclaiming- "Jake Sniffen, as I live! why, my old friend how are you? I have not seen you for an age; and for an instant I hardly re- ollected you, for you have altered consid- erablyand for the better; take a chair, friend Jake and tell us all about yourself but stop, here comes my young man and we may as well retire into my private of- fice." At that moment Lawyer Sharp's attorn- ey, a young man of about twenty-five years    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6833-00000019"/> of age, entered the office, and Sharp h'mself f takiug up a light withdrew with Jake Sniffcn into his private counsel room. "It's all very well, Squire Sharp, said Jake Sniffen, in a low tone as he drew up his chair close beside the lawyer as soon as both had seated themselves at a table in the private room. "Its all very well for you to gammon green ones with your smoth talk, but Blear- eyed Jake as they used to call me and do yet sometimes, knows you like a book, so drop your honey and let's proceed to bus- iness at once. You know, Squire, you did once a very nice little job for me when I lived in this county, and you drew that as- signment which helped me to cheat my cred- itors--" "There, never mind that, now, Jake," hastily interrupted Holdfast Sharp, "that's an old affair and the sooner it is forgotten, the better; and talk lower, Jake, for God's sake!" "But I do mind 'it, Squire," continued Blear-eyed Jake, dropping-his voice lower as he spoke. '"I mind it, because you see I'm willing always to do you a good turn, providing you'll go snacks with me, and because it proves to me you're just the man I want now. Squire, I've got a job on hand now myself that I want you to help me out in legal fashion, and if not that way at any rate help me out so that all shall look open and above board and I shall Ilave a witness that all's right." "Well, speak out at once, Jake, without further circumlocution and let us know ;hat you wish me to do," whispered the lawyer. Eas y, Squire, easy. y:(o ought to be an old enough one not to be in a hurry on important business. the fact is this. I keep an Emigrant boarding-house, and there was an old cove came there a few days since in a dying state. He had just landed from the ship. and from the size of his chest, and other prognoastics as I called it, my runner thought he was worth having and so he got him to my house. Ever since he has been there he has been growing   weaker and weaker, and has always been talking about a daughter whom he says run away from her home in England and whom he has crossed the ocean to find. Squire, I want you to come down to-morrow and see the man. I've kept him close and no one knows anything about his story but myself, perhaps you and I together can make someihing out of this job. I'd rather have yon with me than undertake it alone," and Jake Sniffen leered slightly on the law- yer as he spoke, Holdfast Sharp took no notice of his cli- ents leer, but resting his hand on his chin, he seemed for some moments lost in reflec- tion. "Well, Squire, whatdo you say, will you come and see about it?" asked Blear-eyed Jake, when he thought that the lawyer had had time enough to come to some determi- nation on the matter. "Yes, Jake, I'll be there by six o'clock to-morrow evening, and I think it will be best not to talk any more about this matter until we are under your own roof," "Well, just as you say, Squire, you know best, but I depend on your being there for I don't believe the old fellow will 'last long." And after uttering this parting salutation Blear-Eyed Jake went out through the front office into the street, while the lawyer, tak- ing up an iron bar which stood in one cor- ner of the room, left the apartment in which he had been sitting, by a back door which opened on a graveled walk which led direct- ly up to his house. It seemed singular that for so short a distance, and where the lights from the windows of his own house shone brightly enough to mark distinctly his way, Holdfast Sharp should thus have armed himself as if he were on the point of en- countering some terrible enemy. But it was not less singular than true. The fact that he did thus invariably arm himself every night when he left his office atter dark. was well known in the neighborhood. and public gossips said that he did so be- , cause he feare9 some of those whom he had defrauded would rise up to murder him   even at his own threshold. And thus cau- tiously, on the night of his interview with Jake Sniffen, Holdfast Sharp, with his iron bar grasped firmly in his hand, walked from his office to his house. As Blear-Eyed Jake stepped into the street, or rather road, which led through the village, a man came stealthily around the corner from the rear of the office, and after looking several times up and down the road and discerning that no one was in sight, approached silently behind Blear-Eyed Jake,'laid his hand upon his shoulder, and whispered in his ear- "Don't be afraid; it's only Runyon Doo- al." "Only Runyon Dooal," repeated Blear- Eyed Jake, stopping instantly and trem- bling slightly under the grasp on his shoul- der. "And only Runyon Dooal is enough and to spare; yes, I remember you-Hold- fast Sharp's jackal, always around whenever any one has any thifig to do with him- well, what do you want with me?" "Blear-Eyed Jake, I'm glad you recol- lect me, but you ought to have done so be- fore, Blear-Eyed Jake, who once burnt up his factory and got the insurance, and once made a queer sort of an assignment, and all through the help of Holdfast Sharp and his jackal, Runyon Dooal-Jake, you ought to have remembered me and called me into that consultation you have just had there in the back office with old Sharp. But   never mind, Blear-Eyed Jake, I heard it all, and for fear the old rat will undertake that job without my help, I'll just trouble you, when I come down to your house to-morrow, to put me in some back room or place where I can hear all that takes place between that dying old man, who wants to find his child. and two such hopeful friends as you and Sharp, who want to get the old man's mo- ney. Now, don't refuse, Blear-Eyed Jake, for if you do, I'll be there and put a stop to the whole affair; you know that I can do it, and that I am a man of my word. But come, not to be hard with you, there's ten dollars for doing what I ask you, and you need never fear any harm will come of it, for I suppose you and Sharp intend to do all the business in a legal way," and Run- yon Dooal laid particular emphasis on the two last words. Blear-Eyed Jake took the ten dollars which Dooal slipped into his hand, and promised to perform all that the latter re- quired of him-he felt that he dared not act otherwise. "Good night, my friend Blear-Eyed Jake, and mind, not a word of this to old Sharp," and Runyou Dooal passed like a shadow from the sight of Blear-Eyed Jake. The next morning, at an early hour, Blear- Eyed Jake was on the road to New York. and Holdfast Sharp was but a few hours behind on his track, followed by Runyon Dooal.    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6833-00000020"/> CHAPTER VIIL   THE EIGRANT'S DEATH BED.  At the period of which we write, there, i stood in the neighborhood of Franklin c Square, New York, a large, double, three- g story, brick building, with a sign bearing a the name of "The Emigrant's Home" in c flaring gilt letters, over the door. The sign e also bore the name of Jacob Smiffen in let- M ters hot quite so conspicuous, although pro- I minent enough to be read across the street. t The house itself, from its outward appear- l ance, seemed once to have been the dwel- V ling of some wealthy and important per- sonage, for the tops of the windows were of  curved wood work, and over the door way, which was supported on either side by two  columns with richly carved capitals, a shield and coat of arms were also sculptured in wood. But the whole building presented now a dingy and ruinous look. The lintels of the doors and windows were decayed, and 'in many places sunken ; the carvings were broken off, and the shield and coat of arms over the doorway were so much de- faced, as hardly to be deciphered. The building, in fact, had passed throngh many changes since it was built, and occupied by some English nabob under King George, before the revolutionary war, and now when it was in the possession of Jacob Sniffen, or of the man whom we have introduced to our readers as Blear-Eyed Jake, it present- ed but few tr ces of its former magnifi- cence. If, however, it lacked an imposing exterior, it did not lack in the profit which its interior brought to the pocket of its pro- prietor. Within the "Emigrant's Home" Blear-Eyed Jake reaped a rich harvest by taking in and doing for the many emigrants   who found their way to his doors. And it is not to be supposed that theemigrants came to the "Emigrant's Home" without a guide-Blear-Eyed Jake was too cunning and enterprising a man for that. He had a class of men called runners, who besieged every ship that entered the harbor, and when persuasion would not accomplish their pnrpose, actually took the emigrants and their luggage by force, and before the for- mer hardly knew that they had landed or whore they were, they found themselves in the "Emigrant's Home," receiving the bows and smiles of its proprietor, and re- ceiving his assurance thathe would exert every nerve to make them comfortable.- And Blear-Eyed Jake did make his guests comfortable as long as their money lasted, bnt no longer-when that was gone he turned them adrift, telling them to seek work in the country on the canals and rail- roads. "There's plenty of work to be had," he - would say, " so tramp and get it, and don't be loafing about here, and eating up the liv- r ing of honest folks." y  The singularity of the thing was, that , although many of the emigrants, when they n first arrived, eagerly besought Blear-Eyed r Jake to put them in the way of obtaining o employment, he never knew of any work to t- be had until he knew their pockets were i- running low, and then there was a super- g abundance. h  On the evening after the interview be- D- tween Blear-Eyed Jake and Holdfast Sharp, "as narrated in our last chapter, Holdfast y Sharp walked into the "Emigrant's Home," ts,according to appointment, and was duly 4,   weloomed by his host. "Just step a moment into my private room, until I attend to some new arrivals, and then I'll attend to our business, 'Squire," said Blear-Eyed Jake, as he bowed the lawyer into a small room in the rear of the bar, and then returned behind his counter where with his assistant he was dispensing in large quantities different kinds of liquors to his guests. While thus imployed his eye wandered anxiously to the door, as if he expected the arrival of some person whom he was particularly desirous of seeing. He was not compelled to wait long, for a moment afterwards Runyon Doo- al entered the room. "Quick, follow me," whispered the land- lord, approaching Dooal;"Old Sharp is here and waiting for me." "I know it," was the answer. "Go ahead as quick as you please, I follow," and Blear-Eyed Jake, followed by Runyon Dooal, ascended the main staircase of the building. "This way," again whispered the land- lord, turning into a dark and narrow entry, "Here give me your hand and tread softly." Groping the way with his companion through the dark, Blear-Eyed Jake opened softly a door at the end of the passage and drew Dooal into a small closet, through which a faint light glimmered, as if it came from a crack in the wall. "Do you see that glimmer of light yon- der?" said Jake in a whisper hardly above his breath. "Well, just put your eye up to that hole from which it comes, and which is just about as high as your head, and tell me what you see." Dooal did as he was directed and an- swered, "I see distinctly all the room. I see-  " "There, that's enough," said Jake, inter- rupting Dooal, "let's have no more talk than is necessary: In that room which you see through the hole, all my business with Holdfast Sharp will be conducted."  "Stop a minute," answered Dooal, ' Is there no door leading from this closet into the room?"   "No, but there is a slidingpanel which opens with a spring; no one knows any- thing about it but myself, and there's no danger of Sharp discovering it and coming here to find you." Oh," whispered Dooal, " 'tis not his i coming here I fear, I may want to come ia j there; it will be just as I feel, so friend Blear-Eyed Jake just show me how you open it." Blear-Eyed Jake had no alternative, he was in Dooal's power, and so without a word, and making no noise, he took Doo- al's hand and passed it softly over the wall until it met what seemed to the touch like the head of a large iron naitdriven even with the wall. "There, that's it ; all you have to do is to press it inwards; but for heaven's sake, Dooal, whatever may happen, don't come in." "That will be just as I feel," was the smothered answer of Dooal, and the next moment he was alone in the darkness. Blear-Eyed Jake now hastened down to the apartment where he had left Holdfast Sharp. That individual appeared to be in no good humor, for the length of time that Jake had been absent had begun seriously to tax his patience. "Well, friend Jake, you have been an uncommonly long time in attending to your fresh arrivals, as you call them ; does it al- ways take you so long? you must be an extremely polite landlord," was the law- yer's salutation delivered in a sarcastic tone. "Don't be angry, squire, all in good time, I must attend to my business, and get every thing and every body out of the way before we can undertake such an affair as this, but now come along, I'm ready." Thus l speaking the landlord of the "Emigrant's Home" guided Holdfast Sharp up to the room from which the sliding panel opened into the closet wheie we left Runyon Dooal to wateh proceedings. The apartment into which the lawyer was introduced was a large one, barely fur- nished with a few chairs and an old worn    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6833-00000021"/> out mahogany chest of drawers placed be- E tween the two front windows of the room, and having suspended over it an oval an-;  tique mirror with a gilt frame, once, un- doubtedly, considered quite handsome, but now tarnished and broken in several places,  and the glass itself cracked in the centre. On one side of the room, extended on abed, apparently a comfortable one, lay the figure of an old man of at least seventy years of age. His thin locks, whiter than the pil- low on which they rested, fell from either side of a high, commanding, but pale and wrinkled forehead, on which years of suf- fering, care, and disease, had plainly stamped their story. His eyes were dim and glassy in their expression ; his nose, which was aquiline in its shape, rose up with a painful sharpness from his sunken cheeks, his lips were bloodless, and his whole ap- pearance denoted the near approach of death. The landlord carefully closed and locked the door as he entered, and then approached the bed. Holdfast Sharp, after casting a reconnoitering glance around the room, followed the example of the landlord, and stood by the side of the sick man. "How do you feel to-night, Mr. More- ton?" asked the landlord, gently taking hold of the sick man's hand as he spoke. "I have brought a lawyer to you as you wished; this is my friend Holdtast Sharp, of Greenburgh, my native place; I know him well and can depend upon him. Can you rouse yourself up to speak to him, Mr. Moreton?" The sick man turned his eyes towards his visitors and answered in a remarkably clear tone of voice: "I feel better and stronger than I have for some days, Mr. Sniffen, but it is only the precursor of death-I feel it to be so, and that there remains to me not much time on earth; I must therefore employ that time to the best advantage. Mr. Sniffen, if you have writing materials ready I will leave my last directions in the shape of a will, if that will be valid in this country." "Perfectly, perfectly valid," was the an-   swer of Holdfast Sharp. "Make yourself perfectly easy on that point, your direc- tions shall be sacredly carried out." The eyes of the dying man kindled at the lawyer's words, and he fixed a long searching gaze on the speaker. But the hawk-eye of Holdfast Sharp met the sick man's look with such a mild, sincere and sympathising expression, that the latter re- verted hi3 gaze as if entirely satisfied. In the meantime the landlord had drawn a small ricketty table up to the bedside, and placed upon it some paper, pens and ink, which he appeared to have had in readiness as if in expectation of such an emergency. "Before we proceed to the will," contin- ued the sick man, " hear my story in order that the sacredness of the task which I am about to impose, will be more deeply im- pressed on your minds. My name is John Moreton; I was born in the city of London, have lived there all my life, and once had *here as happy a home as it ever was the blessing of a mortal to enjoy. I had a be- loved wife and an only, cherished daugh- ter named Eliza. I was not rich at this pe- riod, but wus in more than comfortable cir- cumstances. The spoiler entered my Eden and took from it my choicest flower, even the daughter that her father and mother loved, yes idolized, for that is the word which best expresses the feelings which we had towards her. When she fled to her se- ducer's arms I cursed her; yes, notwith- standing the tears and prayers of my dis- tracted wife, I sent to my daughter a letter breathing in awful language a father's curse. My brain was on fire and I knew not what I did. Bitterly have I repented it since, and at no time more fearfully than when on the lips of my dying wife, who sunk into the grave with a broken heart, I heard the murmured blessing and forgiveness on her erring daughter's hea4. I, too, had long before that forgiven her, but had in vain sought to discover her place of ,abode. Years rolled on, I accumulated more money, and at length in my search aL*r my lost daughter, I learned accident   Jake, I made this provision for a very par- ticular reason, for I have now to tell you what will surprise you. I know all about Eliza Moreton and child. The mother is dead and the child is living. There can be no mistake about either. The initials E. M. were found on the handkerchief of the one, and the red diamond mark on the left arm 'of both. The child is now living in Greenburgh; her name is Eva May ; and you, Jacob Smiffen, must put her out of the way for two years at least, and as many more as you please. In a few days I will inform you of her exact place of residence." The lawyer spoke cooly and deliberately, and the landlord raised his hands for a mo- ment in astonishment. "Why, Squire Sharp, what a man you are," at length exclaimed Blear-Eyed Jake, "Why you listened to that old man's story as if you never before heard of his child, and the muscles of your face never moved." "They never do move, Jake, when I am making an important movement," was the  lawyer's answer. "Except in such important movements as you sometimes leave Runyon Doball out of, aud he comes suddenly behind you to put himself into," said Dooal with a low laugh. The lawyer endeavored to, and succeed- ed in, getting up a forced smile, but he made no reply. Blear-Eyed Jake, the landlord, took no notice of the above little sarcasm which Dooal had aimed at Holdfast Sharp, but dropping his head seemed lost for a mo- ment in deep reflection. "I'll do it, Squire," at length,he said, rising up from his chair; "I'll put that girl Eva out of the way."   "I knew you would," replied Sharp, an active mind like yours will not be long in devising the means; of course there is no occasion for you to murder her." The blear eyes of the landlord winced slightly, the cat-eye of Runyon Dooal dropped half way to the floor, but the hawk- eye of Holdfast Sharp looked straight for- ward, calm, piercing, and glittering with a light that seemed at once to flash forth every thing in its meaning and yet to mean nothing-Holdfast Sharp was a sublime ge- nius of villany. Not a word was said in reply to Sharp's last remark, and the money having been put away in a safe place for future distribu- tion, attendants were called and the body decently laid out. The next day the funeral took place, pre- parations were made the day afterwards for proving the will, and then Holdfast Sharp and Runyon Dooal returned to Greenburgh to look after their victim, Eva May. They had for a few years past lost sight of the foundling, and it was not until a day or had elapsed that Runyon Dooal discovered the place of her residence at the house of farmer Robinson. Dooal had been cautious in his inquiries, and this occupied more time than if he had pursued a direct search. On the day of his making the dis- covery where she lived, he also learned that she had departed for New York, her desti- r nation being the house of John Bearem the broker. "Well, then." said Sharp,. iu answer to the above information imparted by Dooal, "we must make post haste to the city and consult with Jake; our next scene of ac. tion must be in the neighborhood Of John Bearem the broker.    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6833-00000022"/> CHAPTER IX.   FALSE JUSTICE AND TRUE VILLAINY. WE must now return to the house in Church street, New York, where at the end of our sixth chapter, we left Eva May in the act of being rescued by the young fireman from the evil designs of John Bearem, the broker, and from her perilous situation on the roof of the house No sooner did Eva, after taking the hand of the young fireman, reach again the inside of the attic room, than her brain reeled and she sunk sense- less into the arms which were extended to support her. Gently the young fireman laid her on the bed and sought to restore life to her inanimate form by bathing her pale brow and temples with water. While he did so the silence of death reigned in the apartment, broken only by the running of footsteps and slamming of doors in the low- er parts of the house as if some unusual commotion had taken place among the in- mates. Within the attic room there were only three other persons beside Eva and her rescuer. These were John Bearem the banker whom the strong arm of the fire- man had just pulled from the window with a force which had sent him spinning into one corner of the room; a police officer who stood by the door; and the same showily-dressed woman who had received Eva on her first entrance into the house, and who now stood at the foot of the bed, gazing with a mingled tremor and assur- ance in her manner alternately on Eva and the fireman. The efforts of the rescuer of Eva were in a few moments successful-her marble buWt, half exposed from the disorder occa-   sioned to her dress by the struggle which she had undergone, again heavec with reg- lar respirations, and she slowly opened her eyes, rolling them at first with a confused and troubled expression around the room, and then fixing them, as her recollection returned more clearly to her, with a look full of gratitude on her deliverer. The next moment she sprang from the bed, flung herself at his feet, and clasping his knees she looked up into his face, her eyes streaming with tears and her bosom heaving with convulsive sobs, as she called down the blessings of heaven on his head. "Poor thing, she often has these turns; and, young man, you had better now let me take care of her; she was only a little crazy-like when she run out onto the roof," and as the showily dressed woman thus spoke, she advanced towards Eva. "Wretch!" exclaimed the young fire- man," back! back! and touch her not!- Mother Driller, I know your reputation and the character of your house of infamy.- There is some devillish villainy at the bot- tom of all this, and I'll find it out before I or you, or any one else leaves this room.- Rise, young woman, and let me hear your story; you shall have protection if you need it!" The attitude, the tone of voice, and the whole appearance of the young fireman, as he uttered these words, were commanding. His form, somewhat above the ordinary size, was muscular and of exact proportions, his features were ruddy with the glow of health, and handsome in the regularity of their outlines his face was shaded by a   profusion of rich auburn curls, which fell  down gracefully from beneath the broad  brim of his glazed hat, and his whole coun- tenance beamed with truth, sincerity, and  good nature-he was a man to be admired under all circumstances, and to be feared  when he stood opposed to conscious and de- tected villainy. At the voice of the fireman, Mother Dril- ler shrunk back abashed, and Eva, rising from her kneeling position and now calm and composed, was about to commence her story, when John Bearem, having recover- ed his effrontery and hastily whispered to the officer, made an attempt to leave the room. The police officer made no resistance to the attempt, and it would have been successful, had not the fireman sprung for- ward and caughtearem by the collar. "Not quite yet, my dashing cove, as long as one of the Etna Hose Company's boys is a- round." was the salutation which John Bear- em received, as the vice-like grasp which had risen from his collar to his throat, held him as if he had been a child, and effectual- ly checked his further egress. "Not quite yet, until I give the word to go ;" and as he spoke the fireman again flung the dignified John Bearem across the room. The broker was extremely red in the face when he ro e from the floor, and ad- justed his dress; but thinking it the part of prudence to smother his indignation, he did not nazard any remonstrance. The police officer put on an important air, and was about to interfere, and had indeed come forward towards the fireman, when the latter waved him back with his hand, saying: "Mr. Police Officer, I advise you as .a friend not to come much nearer to me; I've put my mark on you-I saw that slight of hand trick which you played just now with that old rascal yonder, whose ruffled shirt I've just tumbled, and I give you my word that if you bring your own ugly mug much closer to me, I'll give you a sleight of hand trick worth two of yours, and spoil your beauty. Step back now and keep quiet till   I give the word. There'll be plenty of work for you in half a second." The police officer looked steadily at the fireman for an instant, and then, as if satis- fied that further ,advance was dangerous, he dropped his eyes on the floor and retreat- ed towards his former position. Eva May now told her story as the reader already knows it; and she told it in such an artless manner, that the truth of every word which she uttered went directly to the heart of her defender, the fireman "That's a very pretty story for a girl of the town to tell," said John Bearem, speak- ing up with a bitter sneer, as soon as Eva had concluded. "A very pretty story for an artful girl, who has been endeavoring to to play a trick for the purpose of extorting money. Your valor is all thrown away, my young bravo, on an artful woman, who has been in this house, as Mother Driller will tell you, for months, and is used to such tricks." Mother Driller gave an assenting nod to the brutal speech of the broker, and the police officer screwing up his courage said- "Come, young man, you've displayed bravery enough, but I guess there aint been damage done here, I've seen things of this kind before. I guess we'd better all clear out and leave Mother Driller to take care of the girl." "Wretch," said the fireman, advancing again on the officer, "are you not going to do your duty and arrest that disgrace of manhood there and his vile accomplice, when the truth is as plainly stamped on every word this poor girl has uttered, as villainy is stamped on his face, and the features of a fiend on hers?" "I have no warrant," timidly suggested the officer, "and I fear this case will not 'justify me in arresting without a warrant. If I were to arrest every time there was a muss in such a iouse as this, I should have my trouble for my pains. These girls tell all sorts of stories." The arm of the fireman was raised as if it would have annihilated the officer, but he suddenly lowered it, and turning to Eva,    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6833-00000023"/> who stood trembling with fear and horror, as the character of the house to which she had been lured was thus revealed to her in terms so insulting to herself, he said- "Miss May, trust yourself to me; I will protect you-come, leave this house of in- famy; I'll find a way to get justice for you if there is such a thing as justice to be had in this: make way there you apology for an officer of justice; I'll see to you too as well as John Bearem the broker, and be as- sured Mother Driller, I'll not forget you." Placing the arm of Eva in his, he walked from the room and down the stairs without any opposition from those present, A girl stood at the hall door, which was fastened with both lock and chain, but at a glance from the young fireman's eye, the chain was hastily let down and the lock turned, and a moment afterwards, Eva with her pro- tector stood in the street. "Whither would you lead me V" said Eva, looking up into the fireman's eyes and speaking in a voice choked in its utterance by sobs of emotion. "To a place sacred to me as it will be sacred for you-my home, and to the pro- tection of my mother," and not another word was spoken until they stopped before a small two story house at the upper end of East Broadway, into which they entered by means of the night key which the young fireman carried in his pocket. Before we proceed further in our narra- tive, we will inform the reader more parti- cularly concerning the person under whose protection Eva now was. His name was Frank Noble; he was about twenty years of age, and was the only son of a worthy me- chanic who had died about a year before we Introduce Frank to the reader. Beside his son Frank, the elder Mr. Noble left sur- ving him a widow and one daughter. The widow was old and infirm, and the daugh- ter had passed that boundary of life which leaves a female, in the language of polite- ness, of no particular age; but in the lan- guage of the world, an old maid. But Dora Noble was an exquisite model of an old maid-she was stiff and prim in manner,   but her voice was always gentle and seemed to swell up with a pleasant sound from a heart overflowing with kiidness; her hair was inclined to a silver tinge, and it was was parted with a precise curve behind an antiquated cap; but the brow beneath was clear and placid above a mild blue eye ra- diant with purity and goodness. To hear the voice of Dora Noble, to mark her calm brow and feel the influence of her mild blue eyes, was but to forget her thin stiff figure, her grey hair, and antiquated cap, and to remember only to pay to her an involun- tary tribute of respect-that respect by in- timacy was sure to bring tho addition of affection. Mr. Noble died in debt to no man, but left his family with little or no means of future support. The whole de- pendence of mother and daughter, therefore, fell on Frank, and evenlbung as he was, they leaned on no frail support. Following his father's trade. he attained by industry, energy and skill as a workman, a large cir- cle of customers and friends, and he was enabled to sustain himself, his mother and sister in a comfortable manner. His father had given him a good common school education, which he had himself greatly improved by studying the long winter even- ings, and at the time when we introduce him to the reader he was a far more intelli- gent young man than most of those in his rank of life. In one thing Frank Noble was an enthusiastic-he was a fireman in the fullest sense of the term. At the first stroke of the fire bell he would spring from his bed, as the war horse jumps at the blast of the trumpet, and on through driving rain or cutting hail, through heat and cold, insensible alike to one or the other, he would dash to take his place at the engine's rope or brake ; per- forming his duty manfully and with all his might; and when the flames were at their most fearful point of raging, when burning cinders and stifling smoke and falling beams were thick around him, then his form, like a dark shadow, might be seen, now darting in and out of the blazing pile, and now on the top-most round of some tall ladder, di-   recting the pipe with its whizzing stream c into the roaring furnace which ever and c anon sent forth its forked tongues of fire t above and around him, as if to lap him up, I into their fierce and devouring throat. His q zeal and exploits as a fireman soon raised Frank Noble to be foreman of the Etna  Fire Hose Company, which was eomposed  of some thirty steady, enthusiastic young E firemen like himself. There are two classes 1 of firemen in the city of New York-the ] one class is composed of industrious, steady young men, who work as hard in their daily efforts to make an honest living as they do  at the engine to put out a fire, and who  maintain their characters for sobriety and correctness even in the excitements of a fireman's life; the other class is composed of idle and dissipated rowdies, who work only at a fire, and who make the excite- ment of the fireman's life an excuse and oc- casion for a greater intensity of intempe- rance and rowdyism. Frank Noble belong- ed to the former class. Such were Frank Noble, his mother and sister, at the time when Frank rescued Eva and took her to his home.  It was not later than eleven o'clock at night when Frank Noble led Eva May into the sitting room of his mother's house. The old lady had retired, and Dora Noble was about following her example. She had just put up her sewing, and was regulating the lamps for the night, when Frank and Eva eriteed. It could not be otherwise but that Dora Noble should be surprised at see- ing her brother return thus from a fire which she knew he had but a short time be- fore left the house to attend. Dora showed her surprise on her features, but in a man- ner not offensive or harsh towards Eva. Dora Noble was a woman that never suffer- ed even her looks to condemn, until she knew whether or not there was cause for condemnation. Frank Noble, without giv- ing his sister time to speak, led Eva for- ward, and placing her hand in that of his sister, told briefly the whole story; how that in going to the fire, and before he had reached his engine house, hehad seen Eva   on the roof, had pulled the first police officer he came to afer him, and had has- tened into the house, and all the rest of the particulars as the reader is already ac- quainted with them. ," Enough, brother Frank," was the siF- ter's answer; "I never knew you to deceive me or mother; and this young girl's face is sufficient warrant of her own honesty I take her to my heart, and here beneath thia roof she shall find a shelter." "And now, Miss May," said Frank gaily, "you and sister for the bed, and I for the fire; my comrades will wonder what has become of me. -To-morrow I will go to Greenburgh for your friend Lanky, and he' and I together will try to punish Mr. John Bearem." Eva May looked after Frank Noble as he left the room. Is it wonderful that her eye softened as she looked? In the morning Frank Noble procured a warrant for the arrest of John Bearem, and then started for Greenburgh. On the same morning, at a later hour, John Bearem the broker was seated alone in his private of- fice, evidently in no very pleasant mood of mind, when Holdfast Sharp entered and greeted him with one of his lowest bows and blandest smiles. "Mr. John Bearem, I believe," said Sharp. "The same, at your service," was the an- swer, given with a distant and stately air. Holdfast Sharp gave several introducto- ry "ahems," and then commenced, not quite so fluently, however, as he was in the habit of speaking. "Mr. Bearem, it's a very delicate matter I have come to see you about. A young woman named Eva May left Greenburgh yesterday to come in- to your service. It is necessary I should see her on some business, and my man call- ed at your house this morning but was in- - formed that no such person had been there. or indeed was expected there; nothing * was known about such a person, and think- I ing it very strange, I have taken the liber- ty of calling on you in person. Yiou must    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6833-00000024"/> know something about her, for I understand you engaged her."  The face of the broker for an instant I turned deadly pale, while the hawk-eye of ( the lawyer seemed to pierce into his very  soul. "The fact is," answered the broker, tho-  roughly discomposed; "the fact is I don't know-that is-yes, I do-d-n it, sir," at length he exclaimed, regaining his compo- sure, by working himself into a fit of an- ger. "D-n it, sir, I don't see how it is any of your business whether I know any- thing about the girl or not!" "Pardon me,!' answered Sharp, "it is my business, and I will know!" and the hawk-eye looked sharper and more glitter- ing than before. Mr. John Bearem felt as if he was in a web and the spider was just pouncing on him. Suddenly cooling down he said: "' Well, Mr. Sharp, I do know something about the girl. The fact is she is pretty, and I engaged her, not for a servant, but for something else-you understand-and I've got myself into a fine scrape by it; but as you are a lawyer you happen here at a good time, for I've just been served with a warrant; here it is," and the broker hand- ed a paper to the lawyer. John Bearem suddenly recollected the character which he had heard given to Sharp in Greenburgh, and made up his mind that he was just the man to help him. State your case," said Sharp, looking at the paper; and Johu Bearem told his ver- sion of the story, making very light of the whole affair, and offering the lawyer a large fee if he would carry him safely through. * It is very lucky you have been so frank with me. I'll get rid of the girl without much trouble," was the answer of Sharp.   "Well, do that, and your reward shall not be niggardly, I promise you," said Bearem; and after Sharp had pocketed a check for a considerable sum, the two sepa- rated. The day when the warrant was returnable came, and with it, before the magistrate, came Eva, Ephraim Lanky and Frank No- ble, John Bearem, Holdfast Sharp, Runyon Dooal, Mother Driller and the police officer. The examination was held in the afternoon, and in a private room. By the influence of Bearem's money, the whole affair had, up to this time, been kept secret, and the pa- pers of the day had not contained a word concerning it. Ephraim Lanky, thinking that his sole testimony would be sufficient to establish the character of Eva on a pre- liminary examination, so as to bring Bear- em to trial, had not deemed it necessary to bring the Robinsons with him; but he was astounded, and he trembled for Eva's case, when he saw that Holdfast Sharp and Run- yon Dooal were arrayed with Bearem against her. The examination did not last tlong; the ears of the magistrate seemed to be wide open to all advanced by Sharp, Dooal, Mo- ther Driller and the police officer, while it received with great difficulty all that was brought forward on the part of Eva. Doo- al, Sharp, Mother Driller and Bearem, did not hesitate to asperse the character of Eva, and the issue of the matter was that the magistrate dismissed the case and discharg- e ed Bearem. It may seem strange, that in ethe city of New York, and in the nineteenth century, such should be the result; but k gold is all powerful, and often works won- ders with the administration of justice-it worked wonders in this case.   CHAPTER X.   PL&amp;AN SEWING, PLAIN LOVE, AND A DARK DISAPPEARANCE. "Is it thus that law protects the poor in the city of New York?" said Ephraim Lanky, addressing Frank Noble, and draw- ing the arm of Eva closer into his own, as they walked to Noble's house after the ex' amination before the magistrate had been concluded. "It is thus that it seems to shield the rich at any rate," answered Frank, whose looks had hitherto during the progress home been bent on the ground.  "But don't be cast down, Miss May," continued Frank, now raising his eyes and speaking in an animated and determined tone. "This magistrate only represents one of a class; there are others before whom wealth stands the same as poverty-there are in New York tribunals where justice, strict and im- partial, is administered, and I'll find that tribunal if I have to besiege the door of every court in the city and county." Eva turned a grateful look on her young champion, and Ephraim said, "May God Almighty bless you for your kindness to the fpoor foundling." It was arranged that Ephraim Lanky and Eva should stay a short time at the house of Mrs. Noble, while Frank endeavored to procure an indictment against Bearem, and also to interest some powerful friends in her behalf. Frank was sanguine that in so just a cause he should be able to do both. and he entered into it with his whole heart and soul. In the meantime Eva, who shrunk from the idea of being dependant n the bounty of her new-found friends,   assisted Dora Noble at the :p1sig sewing, which was obtained at the clothing estab- lishments of the city, and which formed the chief occupation of Dora, by which she helped her brother to support the family. "I have heard them talk, even up in the country where I came from, that the sewing women in New York have a hard and try- ing time of it in their endeavors to get a living. Is this true, Miss Noble?" said Eva one day when she was sewing with -Dora on a lot of coarse cloth coat patterns. "Before I answer your question," replied the old maid, with a tender look on Eva, for Eva had won her whole heart as well as that of her mother, " before I answer your question, Eva, I wish to tell you once for all, that you must not call me Miss Noble; call me Aunt Dora, as all my friends call me; or you may call me sister, as Frank does ;" and Aunt Dora, as we shall here- after call her, paused a moment to thread her needle. When Aunt Dora told Eva to call her "Aunt," Eva smiled; but when the per- mission extended to call her sister, Eva blushed. Aunt Dora, however, was busy in threading her needle, and did not see Eva's blush. But Ephraim Lanky, who was in the room, and who, at the turn the conversation had taken, had raised his head up from the book which he had been read- ing, saw the whole of Eva's blush and un- derstood it; and he smiled, for a new and indefinite idea, which took in Frank Noble as a husband for Eva, seemed to strike him Iand give to him considerable pleasure.    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6833-00000025"/> The next moment his great white eyes fell with a fixed and almost ludicrously soft look on Aunt Dora, and another new and ponderous idea, which took in himself as a husband for Aunt Dora, seemed to strike him; but, as if the idea was too ponderous and magnificent for him to entertain, he seemed to relinquish it as suddenly as he had conceived it, for he shook his head as if it could hot be possible, and then resum- ed his reading. Neither did Aunt Dora' notice the smile or the look of Ephraim Lanky, for the needle still occupied her at- tention-Aunt Dora's eye was somewhat hazy, and the passing a thread through the eye of a needle was with her an achieve- ment which required time. When, howev- er, she had at length accomplished it, she continued her address to Eva: "It being. settled, Eva, that you shall call me Aunt Dora or sister--" "I'll call you Aunt Dora," hastily inter- rupted Eva. "Well, then, my child," continued the kind old maid, in the same measured, p'e- cise, but mild tone which she always used, "Aunt Dora let it be, and Aunt Dora has to answer your question by saying that the sewing women do have a soul and body crushing labor to perform-poor pay, wear- ing out the eyes and the frame, and insult and hard usage to wear out the spirit. I myself, have not had so hard a time as oth- ers, for I have had a home, and a mother and a brother to protect me from insult and wrong, and save me from sole dependance on the needle. But I have known others, many others, whose entire reliance for sup- port has been on their needles, and hard has been their fortune. Think, Eva, of a mis- erable garret in the cold winter time, and of the rain and sleet and snow and keen biting air driving in through the cracks and broken windows, scantily stuffed with rags; and think of a young girl, young like yourself, Eva, sitting in that garret through the long nights and days-work, work, work, and stitch, stitch, stitch ; no rest, no pause-her thin and bent body shivering over the few dull coals that mock the re-   semblance of a fire, and the tears falling down pale cheeks on the work, from her her heavy, red and inflamed eyelids-a crust of bread and a cup of the poorest tea, on a broken table beside her for her meal ; and then think of this young girl walking through the streets at all hours and in all weathers, to carry her work to her hard taskmasters or mistresses-standing tremb- ling before them, and fearing that for some excuse made for the purpose, even the small pittance which hardly keeps her from starv- ing, will be denied to her altogether, or detained from her at their convenience. And then too, hardest of all, think of the infamous proposals made to her by her em- ployers or their clerks, even at their coun- ters and in their shops, and by the dissipa- ted young men who meet her in the street or dog her footsteps-these proposals also often tempting in their nature to weak minds with starvation and bitter and end- less toil staring them in the face. If the sewing girl sometimes falls, under these last circumstances, she is more to be pitied, Eva, than hardly censured; if she triumphs, if she braves the starvation and the toil, if she tramples under her feet with scorn and indignation the temptation and the insult, and holds fast to her self respect and virtue, come what may, even death itself, then she , is a heroine, Eva, of the highest order-but the world takes no note of her heroism, for she is only a sewing girl. All what I de- scribe to you, I have known, Eva, of my own knowledge, in the cases of many sewing girls with whom I have been acquainted, and I have known other things, have known the most barefaced frauds to be practised on these girls, and they not able to obtain the least redress-such, for instance, as em- ployees advertising for a large number of hands, some hundred or two girls applying and doing the work given to them, in the best of manner, and then being cheated out of their pay for it by the employers' saying that the work was slovenly done and spoil- ed, and many other frauds of a similar kind. Eva, hard indeed is the sewing girl's lot in New York. There are good and kind and   considerate employers, but where there is one such there are a hundred bad and unfeel- ing ones; and the poor friendless girl who leans solely on her needle for support, leans on a thing sharper than the needle's point to pierce her to the very quick." "Oh, Aunt Dora, you bare drawn a frightful picturc," said Era,dropping her needle and cov(wing her face with her hands, I pity these poor girls from the bottom of my heart." "Why it's worse than the Greenburgh Poor House under the administration of that savage, Capt. Josh Bull," said Ephraim Lanky, suffering his look to fall upon the floor. A week passed on, and Frank Noble was still busy in endeavoring to procure an in- dictment against John Bearem. The case had already become public and created quite an excitment, and Frank worked hard to obtain for Eva justice for the wrong which she had suffered. In thus working for her, and being daily with her, it is not supposed that the heart of the young man did not become deeply interestel. It did; and before Frank Noble himself hardly knew it, he was deeply in love with the beautiful and simple minded girl whose cause he had undertaken. It was twilight. Aunt Dora, attended by Ephraim Lanky had gone out to carry some finished work to the store by the pro- prietor of which she was employed; old Mrs. Noble had retired to herroomn and Frank Noble and Eva were alone in the common sitting apartment of the house. The twilight of a clear mild day always seems an hour formed expressly for all lov- ers; and as the twilight to which we refer was of the above description, it did Siot ap- pear to vary from its usual influence in the case of Eva and Frank. It is true that neither had mentioned the subject of love, but the eye had spoken a language not to be mistaken, although the tongue had re- mained s lent.. Deeper and deeper grew the twilight, and yet the lamp remainled unlighted. Frank and Eva kept the pro- found silence in which both had alternately' 4   regarded each other, and looked out on the pleasant little garden-like yard at the back of the house on which the shadows of night were falling. As Eva mused in the twi- light her whole life passed in review before her, and the form and noble bearing of the young fireman, as he appeared when com- ing to her rescue, was strangely but very pleasantly prominent in all the pictures which rose before her imagination. As Frank also mused by the side of Eva, there was only one image before his imagination as there was before his eye, and that image was Eva May. A long drawn sigh at length broke the stillness between the dreaming parties at the window, and the sigh (ame from the breast of Frank Noble. Frank started at the sound of his own sigh, and as if manhood had whispered to him that looking, and dreaming, and sighing were not the only things required of a man who truly loved, he suddenly drew his chair closer to Eva, and took her hand into his. "Eva," he said, in a voice tremulous and tender, and then he paused. There was no answer; but the hand which Frank held, although it trembled, was not withdrawn, and he felt a hot tear fall on the back of his own. "Eva," continued Fran;, "I can no longer disguise, neither should I do so, that I love you-love you tenderly and with my whole soul; I have not much to offer you, but this love and a pair ofstout hands and a good will to work for you, and make you comfortable and happy. Eva May, we have not known each other long, but can you return my love, and will you be my wife?" The hand which Frank held trembled more violently than ever, and for aninstant Eva spoke not, as with bowed head and fast falling tears, she seemed to sink heavily on the arm of her lover, which had been passed unresistingly around her waist. But recov ering at length, in some degree her com posure, she raised herself up, and looking lull ,liand trustingly in the eyes of her lover, she answered in a calm. low voice, which seemed like music to her listener.    <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6833-00000026"/> "As frankly, Mr. Noble, as you have told be me you love me, as frankly do I answer ai that I love you in return; could I feel other- wise for him who has acted towards me the Ic noble part that you have, H- -"  "Put not your love on the score of grat- b itude, Eva," interrupted Frank; " what I  have done for you I did when I knew you not, and love was far from my thoughts. I s saw you in distress and peril, and the aid s which I gave to you I should have given to  any one else under similar circumstances."  "I do not," answered Eva, "put mylove  on the score of gratitude, and yet, generous  man, the love I feel for you is born of grat- itude, and is none the less intense and last- ing for that reason; as such take it, Frank ;-  but our union must long be deferred.- There is much before me ere I can take upon myself the name of your wife ; it is not that I fear to work with you for our mutual and honest maintenance, or that I fear our labor will not suffice for our wants -it is not this Frank; but my fame must be cleared before all men from the aspersion under which it now rests. I cannot, Frank, do not think hard of me; under present circumstances I cannot become your wife." It was in vain that Frank plead with a lover's earnestness, that she would alter her resolution, but she still told him that ihe loved him and that the time would come when she would acknowledge it at the altar, nevertheless for the present it must be de- fered. She felt, she said, as if her adopted father, Ephraim Lanky, would thus counsel her, and that she was right. The entrance of Ephraim Lanky and Aunt Dora, here prevented further discus- sion between the lovers, and the lighting of the candles showed a pair of tell-tale faces to the old bachelor and the old maid, which   both stared at, but on which neither made any remark. That same night the above passage of love was made known by Frank to his mother and sister, and to Ephraim Lanky by Eva. The engagement of the lovers and the resolution of Eva were approved by all the parties, to whose approval they were submitted; and Frank, animated with the strongest incentive now determined to re- double his energies to procure justice for his future wife. A few nights after the above occurrence, Frank being absent at a fire, Ephraim Lanky accompanied Eva, at rather a late hour, to a store in Cherry street, for which she had for the first time finished work, and which she wished therefore to deliver herself. Frank came home about 2 o'clock in the mnorning and found his sister and mother in a terrible state of alarm, owing to the fact that Eva and Ephraim had not yet returned. Rushing like a madman out of the house, he went directly to the store in Cherry street, the owner of Which, who lived in the upper part of the house, and had retired to rest, he roused from his slum- bers without much ceremony. The infor- r mation he received, was that Eva had been to the store before it was closed for the ^ night, had delivered and been paid for her r work, and further than that nothing was e known of her movements or those of the old e man who attended her. Frank spent the ', rest of the morning until daylight, roaming through the streets, and plunging into all d sorts of places and alleys with the hope of 1 either finding or hearing of the missing ones. But it was all vain; at the dawn of d day he returned home, weary and sick at 3- heart, and his brain and soul racked and of torn with the most forboding fears concern- es ing the mysterious disappearance of Eph- rh raim and Eva.   CHAPTER XI.   THE RIVRJ THE CELLAR, THE SAILOR AND THE JAILER. At abou  six o'clock on the morning when Frank Noble was tossing on his bed in a feverish sleep, and Aunt Dora with her eyes blinded with tears was mechanically and with depressed spirits, employed at her daily work, the bell was rung so violently that it caused Frank to spring from his bed, and Aunt Dora to run with terror to- the street door, at which Frank arrived at almost the same moment with her. A fear- ful sight presented itself to their gaze as soon as the door was opened. Ephraim Lanky, pale and haggard, with a deep cut over his forehead from which the blood was slowly trickling, unable to stand, and sup- ported in the arms of two police officers, was before them. It was but the work of a moment to place the unfortunate man on a bed and send for the physician, while Aunt Dora, who was an excellent nurse and not altogether unacquainted with what was necessary to be done in such cases, busied herself in staunching the blood of the wound and endeavoring to restore the pa- tient to his consciousness and speech. Her efforts were successful before the arrival of the doctor, who paid Aunt Dora a high com- pliment for her skill, and after examining the wound, imparted the pleasing informa- tion that it was not dangerous, but that with the good nursing of Aunt Dora and by following his directions, the patient would be on his feet again in a few days The story which Ephraim had to tell when he recovered his recollection and could speak connectedly, was substantially as follows: *   He and Eva had proceeded to the store in Cherry street, without interruption, Eva had delivered her work and been paid for it, and when both of them, on their return home, had advanced a few steps beyond the point where Roosevelt intersects Cherry street, he, Ephraim, received a blow on lhis head which deprived him of his senses. The first of his recollection after that was a sort of indistinct consciousness of awaking out of a powerful sleep, and receiving another heavy blow on his head, and awaking again to full consciousness, struggling in the wa- ters of the river near the dock and calling aloud for help-after that all was indistinct until on his own bed he came wholly to himself, under the nursing of good Aunt Dora. The information of the police officers sup- plied what was lacking in Ephraim's story with regard to his rescue. It seems that they, hearing his cries, had hastened to his aid, and succeeded in getting him out of the water; that he had just consciousness enough left to tell them where he lived, when he sank exhausted and senseless into their arms, in which state they had brought him home. With regard to the fate of Eva, Ephraim knew nothing. The state of mind, into which this infor- mation, leaving as it did the fate of Eva undetermined, plunged Frank Noble, was fearful, and it required the efforts of the grief-stricken Aunt Dora and Ephraim, to calm him. We must, however, leave for the present the inmates of the house in East Broadway to their grief and fears, and en- lighten the reader with respect to Eva. To do so we must once more change the scene    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6833-00000027"/> to the "Emigrant's Home" in Franklin tl Square, kept by Blear-Eyed Jake or Jacob  Sniffen. It was an apartment or cellibout ten n feet square; the walls of solid stone and c with no loop hole or window for the air, or opening for entrance, except a square trap e door in the ceiling, formed of heavy oak q timber, and from which a flight of rough and a narrow stone steps descended. Two chairs f and a rough looking bed in one corner, com- t pleted the whole furniture of this apparent i dungeon.  Within the cell which we have above des- i cribed, in the early part of the night of the i disappearance of Eva May and the rescue of EphraimLanky from the water, stood Blear- eyed Jake and another man of about his height and figure. The face of Jake's com- panion, however, differed materially from his own, although both possessed brutality and revolting ugliness in common. The eyes of the man by the side of Jake were large, staring and blood-shot, and with, if we may use the phrase, the leer of the devil in their expressions; his features were heavy, and their revolting bloatedness was travers- ed with numerous deep and livid scars, which gave to his appearance astill greater degree of hideousness ; on his forehead, pricked in with India ink, were two small marks in the shape of a cross, and his dress was that of a sailor. "Well, Jack of the Cross," said Blear- Eyed Jake, holding up the candle in his hand so that his companion could see every  part of the cell, "I'm d-d glad to make your acquaintance; I knew the moment I clapped my eyes on you that you were just the man for my purpose, so I opened my mind freely to you and found I was not mistaken. How do like this hole, Jack of the Cross? ain't it a famous one for our use? I've used it afore, Jack, and always found it answered for what I wanted it. But, Jack, how the d-- did you come to have that cross marked on your forehead? I've been so busy in talking with you about getting possession of that girl we're bound to have, that I've forgot to ask you about   that cross of yours, which struck my eye the first time I saw it. Why didn't you have an anchor,or flag, or anything else marked on you instead of that infernal cross?" "Avast there, Blear-Eyed Jake," growl- ed Jack of the Cross, "you've asked more questions than even a landlubber shark of alawyer can answer at once. First, and foremost I don't wonder you knew at first that I was just the boy to help you in this internal business, for I know I carry my : sign in my face. Decent sailors curse and fear me-fear me, that's the word. -I like it-ha! ha!" ", Laugh, old fellow," said Blear-Eyed Jake; "laugh as loud as you please ; noone can hear the sounds in this place if a legion of devils sent up a chorus." ," Now to answer your questions," contin- ued Jack of the Cross. "First,.I like this place, and think no one but a fiend like you or myself could have invented or have F courage to use it. Second, a felon priest,who [ was once my messmate on board a smug- , gling craft, where he had shipped after his - escape from the galleys, marked this cursed , cross on my forehead when we were both r half drunk, and it has burnt there like fire , ever since. I've been called Jack of the 1 Cross from that time. I once murdered an s old man for his money, and when his breath was leaving his body, he pointed to this - cross, and said, 'May that sacred emblem s ever burning into your heart be your pun- y' ishment for this.' The curse has done its e work-I am cursed, and I care not what I I do," and again the fearful laugh of Jack of 4t the Cross rung through the cell. y  Even Blear Eyed Jake was appalled at At that laugh and confession of his master in )f iniquity who stood beside him ; but soon ir recovering himself he said; rs  "Mind, Jack, I'll have no murder in this t. case, except the old schoolmaster I told you to of, should be with the girl, in which case, I i? don't see how we can help it; but we must at if we can; but look outhow you use the girl, id don't hurt her; she's only to be gagged and at brought herepfrom whence you can take   her to some safe place beyond the sea, where , we can get her again at the end of two  years, if that old employer of mine doesn't i do the right thing. Do this, Jack, and you  shall be well paid ; if you fail me, bad as  you are, I'll find a way to be even with  you."  "Never fear ; I'm honest when I pass my word," was the answer. "And now," said Jake, " we must go to our watch in Cherry street, You get the carriage and be ready in ths alley in Rose-  velt street. I saw the girl go in a store in Cherry street yesterday and get some work. I've watched the place ever since ; she has not been back there, but she must come soon, perhaps to night, while we are stand- ing here ; come let's go," and the two wor- thies left the stone dungeon in the cellar of the "Emigrant's  Home" in  Franklin Square, About ten o'clock on the night when Eva May and Ephraim Lanky stood in the store in Cherry street, and Blear-Eyed Jake and Jack of the Cross were pletting evil against them, the streets of New York suddenly be- came enveloped in a thick darkness pecul- iarly favorable for the deeds of all vllains, but extremely unpleasant and unsafe for the out-door walk of all honest citizens.- This sudden darkness was owing simply to the fact that the moon which had been shin- ing bright* during the early part of the evening. had become hidden from sight by the heavy clouds, and not a lamp in the streets emitted a spark of light. In the darkness of the night and before a narrow alley in Rosevelt street, there stood a carriage, and in the black mouth of the alley itself, stood two men, Blear-eyed Jake and Jack of theCross. "Hist," said Jake, scarcely above his breath. "Our game, Jack, is at hand. I've just been round to the store and they're coming this way Iknew they would now be careful, have your gag ready-you take the girl." There was a low whisper of" aye, aye," in answer. and then all again was still. Slowly Eva and Ephraim picked their   away round the corner of the street and up opposite the entrance of the alley. They had not advanced more than two steps beyond when the villains who were watching sprung upon them from their hiding place. It was but the work of a moment-before they could speak or recover from the suddennes of the attack, the unfortunrte victims were overpowered. While Blear-Eyed. Jake threw his arms around Eva like a vice of iron and thrust a gag in her mouth, Jack of the Cross endeavored to follow his exam- ple with respect to Lanky but discovering as soon as his hands touched him that Lanky might be a troublesome customer, he cut 'hi matter short by dealing Lanky a heavy a' ,w with a short club which he carried. 'he blow was effectual, and with the quick- J)ss almost of lightning, each villain drew nia victim into the alley. "Now, young woman," whispered Blear- Eyed Jake, taking a veil from his pocket and throwing it over the bonnet of Eva; "just walk peaceably out with me to that carriage as if you were going to ride with me, no harm is intended you but if you don't do it, I'll stab you and take you there dead." Strange to say that during all this dread- ful scene, Eva had not swooned although her form trembled violently. Eva wis pos- sessed of a strong mind: she had been in many trying scenes, and even in this one, when death and perhaps something worse, stared her in the face, her faculties seemed to rise in clearness with the necessities of the occasion-she saw at once that it was better for her to obey the villain, and she did so. A moment afterwards, Jake drove off with Eva from Rosevelt street, leaving Jack of the Cross alone with Lanky in the alley. And in the darkness of the night, there was no police officer to be seen or heard ; no steps of any kind resounded on the pave- ment, and this bold, vile deed had been committed in silence and security. As soon as Jake had departed, Jack of the Cross, from the depths of the alley, drew forth a small hand-cart, and took from it a    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6833-00000028"/> rope with a stone tied to one end of it; fas-  tened the other end on the neck of the sens- a lessbody of Lanky, threw the body into the S cart, and then covered it up with a piece of 1 old canvass cloth.          t And through the dark night, with no eye upon him, and with no hand upon him, Jack  of the Cross trundled his cart down to the  river and emptied its load into the black and silent waters. But Jack of the Cross had not struck Lanky a mortal blow and he did not tie the stone to the rope with his accustomed skill, for the stone slipped from its fastening, and while the villain took his way towards the " emigrant's Home," the body of Lanky rose to the sur- face of the river, restored to consciousness, by its sudden plunge into the water. For a long time he struggled in the water un- heard by any one, until at length he caught hold of a projecting beam which struck out from the dock, and here with the strength of despair he clung until his strength fail- ed, and with a last despairing shriek he sunk again into the dark still waters.- This last cry of Lanky was heard by the two Police officers, who, as we have before related went to his assistance, and saved him. From a deep and heavy sleep Eva May awakened and looked wildly around her ; a wall of solid stone hemmed her in, and from ahookin the rocky arch above her head, a lamp cast down its dull gloomy light on her; she covered her face with the blank- et of her wretched bed and swooned. Alas! poor Eva! she was in the cellar-dungeon of the"Emigrant's Home." When Blear- Eyed Jake after leaving the alley had taken Eva to his house in Franklin Square he had at first led her, with the veil still over her face, into a large apartment, where after offering her some refreshments which she refused, he secretly dropped some white powder into the pitcher of water on the table, and left the room. Eva drank a glass of water, and immediately afterwards   had sunk into the deep sleep from which she awakened to find herself in the dungeon of stone-it was morning, when Eva awoke, but day and night were both alike in that terrible prison. A dash of water in her face startled Eva from the swoon into which she had fallen on discovering in what a fearful place she was confined. As again she looked, she saw bending above her a form still more fearful than the appearance of the dungeon. It was the form of neither man or boy, but an abortion of each. The figure was about four feet high, with a hump back, a body fat and flabby ; a head small with its fore- head receding abruptly to almost a sharp point at the back of the head, eyes grey, staring and idiotic arms almost as bony as the body, and legs short and crooked. Such was Eva's jailer who had dashed the water into her face; and on whom she now looked with horror. As soon as he saw that the water had taken effect, the dwarf jailor pointed with this long skinny finger to a loaf of bread and a pitcher of water and then shuffled towards the steps as if to go. "Speak, fearful man I in the name of God tell me where I am, why I am here, who have I injured that I should thusbe treated, speak! speak, as you hope for salvation," exclaimed Eva, her despair nting her even to the act of clinging to her jailer's knees. A harsh gutteral sound came from the jailer's lips, but no words, his long fingers made signs in the air, and Eva, ap- palled and trembling threw herself on the floor exclaiming in heart-rendering tones. "- Great God! be thou my help-stone 1 I blank and impenetrable stone for my prison house and the deaf dumb for my jailor! help me! help me! Oh, my God!" As Eva thus called on her God for aid, the deaf and dumb jailer crawled up the nar- row steps 6f the dungeon and disappeared 3 through the trap in the ceiling.   CHAPTER XIL   ATRE SEAROH FOR EVA. - It was about noon of the day when  Ephraim Lanky had been restored to his  friends in East Broadway, and the school-  master, with Aunt Dora to watch over him, had sunk into a deep and heavy slumber, when Frank Noble directed his steps towards Wall street. "Can it be possible," said Frank to him- self, as he pursued his way, " that this Bearem is fiend enough not only to endeavor to ruin Eva, but also to murder her? and yet who else can be concerned in her disap- pearance. Holdfast Sharpj and Runyon Dooal cannot have had anything to do with it, for base as they may be I can see no motive for them to risk so much as they, would by endeavoring to murder or put' her out of the way. I can see why Hold- fast Sharp should appear as Bearem's law- yer or the lawyer of any one else in any cause, but I do not see why he should go as far as this for any client-no, no, John Bearem, and John Bearem only must be the mover in this affair, and the tools he has worked with must be some low villains dif- ferent from Sharp or Dooal. I'll sound' John Bearem and see how he acts ;" and with his teeth set close Frank Noble entered John Bearem's office. "Is the principal of this concern, Mr. John Bearem, within?" sai4 Frank to a spruce dapper-looking man, who, at a ma- hogany counter firnished at each end with polished desks of the same material, was counting a huge pile of bank notes before him. The hands of the man who was count- ing the money were very small and white, and a large diamond ring glittered on one   of his little fingers. Itwas just the kind of looking hand which seemed peculiarly adapted to the handling of money, and the owner of it appeared himself to be conscious of the faet, as with the rapidity of lightning and stopping only occasionally to touch his thumb and forefinger on a moistened sponge before him, he threw the bank notes one after the other into the most even-sized piles imaginable, pinning delicately around each a narrow strip of white paper, on which he marked the amount it represented, and then tossing it behind him on a shelf divid- ed into a number of little bins filled to the brim with gold and silver and all sorts of paper representations of money. "Is Mr. Bearem within?" asked Frank Noble again and in a louder tone, for the dapper man with the white hand and the diamond ring had paid no attention to the first question. "Eh! What?" was the answer to Frank's second question, and the hand paused in its labors, holding a bank note suspended in its grasp in such a manner that the little finger , was turned up to the light and the diamond ring gave out brilliant corruscations full in I the eye of Frank. The fireman for the third time then re- peated his question. and the owner of the hand with the ring then resumed his occu-   pation with the simple answer "Busy in the private office," motioning at the same time his hand towards a pair of closed folding , doors, the lower panels of which were of s polished mahogany, and the upper of thick ground glass, through which it was impos- sible to see what might be passing beyond. Frank Noble looked at the dapper money e changer and again spoke.    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6833-00000029"/> "My friend, busy or not busy I mustth and will see Mr. John Bearem at once, tell to him so."               tr The tone of the speaker was firm and a rather loud, and both its firmness and loud- co ness being of a character not very usual in re the majority of visiters to Mr. John Bearem's I' broker office, the dapper gentleman at the g counter looked up in surprise, and the two other clerks at the desks followed his ex- hi ample, while several persons who had come w in from .the street with the intention of buy- r ing, selling or borrowing money, or trans-  acting other business connected therewith, e also elevated their eyebrows with the evi- dent expectation of seeing a minature edi- y tion of a row. While such was the tableaux d presented in the main office, the folding r doors of the private apartment of Mr. John i Bearem were hastily thrown half way back and the face of that individual himself, very t red and bearing evident traces of anger, l was thrust through the opening.  "What's the meaning of this, who is it I that insists in such a loud and vulgar tone i on seeing me?" exclaimed John Bearem in  a haughty and commanding voice, but with  the last word he uttered his eye fell on Frank Noble, and the retness of his face  paled a little, and hishands trembled slight- ly on the knobs of the doors which he held. Frank Noble did not give the broker time to say any more, but advancing pushed straight forward through the doors, the bro- ker involuntarily making way for him, and closing the doors after his entrance. "To what am I indebted for the honor of this visit?" said the broker in a low voice, his lipsquiveriog and his whole frame shak- ing with the violent efforts which he made to suppress the indignation which he felt, but which prudence suggested to him it would best for him to smother. "Speak low sir," he continued," for I presume I am the only one in this office interested in 'what you have to say." "My business," answered the young fire- man dropping his voice, but speaking. still firmly and looking the broker full in the eyes, "is simply to iuclitire of you where   that young lady, Eva May, whom you sought to ruin a few days ago, now is; answer me truly and without prevarication, or I'll find a way to wring it out of you without re. course to law -yes, John Bearem, without recourse to law; for my blood is up, and I'll move heaven and earth but I'll find that girl." The broker recovered his composure, for he could answer the question with truth without injury to himself. He therefore returned the angry gaze of Frank Noble with one of unfeigned astonishment, as he calmly answered: "Where is Eva May?-is she not with you sir? The last I saw of her she was un- : der your protection; if she is not there now I pledge you my word of h)nor I know i not where she is." Frank Noble was puzzled: he expected the broker would quail when he answered, hesitate and grow confused, but the impress of sincerity was in his look, and there was t not the slightest tremor inhis voice or man- e ner. The broker saw his advantage and n that the fireman at least half if not wholly h believed him, and he continued- n  "Whatever may have been the unpleas- e ant passages between us, Mr. Noble, re- t- specting thls girl, you may take my word i. now that I know nothing about her; you Le may throttle me here in my chair, I am d powerless before you, and if my life depend- o- ed upon my giving you the information Id which you desire, I could not give it." Frank Noble was more puzzled than ever, of the countenance of the broker still remained e, perfectly calm, although Frank kept his k- gaza bent upon him, as if his glance would le pierce down into the lowest depths of his it, soul. it "If he Hes," thought Frank to himself, k '" he's the coolest liar I ever came across. I and it is evident if he does lie, can't scare in him at this time into telling the truth, I'll try what bribing him will do.'r re- "John Bearenm," said Noble, aound, ' the ill, man who has acted the part you acted tc- he i v-rds Eva May, when you enticed her to re the infamous house where y.1a sogh t to   ruin her, is not entitled to be believed by t honest men, under any circumstances, even s under oath, and you are such a damnable villain that I can't believe you although  you speak with such apparent sincerity;  now listen. I've threatened, you know, ( and I am a man who keeps his word, to j bring you before a court of justice, and ex-  pose in its true light the whole of your a conduct with regard to the Church street affair; you know that you tremble for the result, for you have no later ago than day  before yesterday, sent overtures to my law- ( yer, to settle the matter and hush it up. Now, John Bearem, damnable villain as you are, if you will tell me where Eva May is, or restore her to me, and I'll drop all pro- ceedings against you-I'll let you go un- punished for the Wrong you have done, if, you'll make this atonement. Eva May has been forcibly abducted, she may be mur- dered by this time for all I know-will you, I beseech you, nay I, Frank Noble, implore you to speak " and the veins on the young fireman's face swelled almost to bursting, and his whole body trembled with the vio- lence of his emotions. "If you offered me the mines of Golcon- da, Mr. Noble, it would be in vain. I can- not tell you; if I could I would, so help me God!" Frank Noble rose from the chair on which had thrown himself, smothered with a vio- lent effort the feelings which agitated his breast, and with a slight bow left the room and the office. "Strange I strange!" he muttered to self as he returned home, " who can it be, and what the motive?" and the gloom gathered heavier on his brow and despair settled deeper on his soul. Ephraim Lanky awakened fromhis sleep, refreshed in body and clear in mind. "Has Frank returned? ah, yes, there you are my brave friend ; speak quick, do not keep me in suspense. I can bear to hear it if your news be bad," exclaimed the poor school- master, staring anxiously and earnestly at Frank who stood at the foot of the bed, his head bowed on his breast and his whole at-   titude bespeaking the greatest dejection of spirits. "There, be quiet, my dear friend," said Aunt Dora mildly, as she laid her hand gently on Lanky's forehead, " you must be quiet; you have still a great deal of fever, you'll hurt yourself by exertion; keep quiet then, and trust to Frank, he will do all he can lo find poor dear Eva." Two large tear drops fell from Ephraim Lanky's eyes and rolled down his bony cheeks on the pillow, as he turned a look of mingled resignation and reverence on Aunt Dora. He had once been an angel to the little Eva, Aunt Dora was now his angel. "I have learned no tidings of Eva. I have just come from a vain visit to John Bearem, and may God help us, Ephraim," said Frank Noble, as he raised his head slightly, let it fall again on his breast, and then leaned heavily against the bed. Aunt Dora looked very pale and her lips quivered, while old Mrs. Noble rocked herself in her arm chair, and uttered a low sigh. There was darkness, deep darkness on the souls of all-on Ephraim Lanky in his bed and on the grieving group which surrounded him. "Have you had the house in Church street searched yet?" at length said the schoolmaster, breaking the deep silence which had reigned for some moments in the room. "Yes ; Ive been there with the police of- i fleers aad searched it from top to bottom; she is not there. I've put advertisements in the papers and posted handbills offering , a reward for her recovery. I've done all I i ould at present, and we must wait." "I shouldn't wonder," again said the schoolmaster, " if Holdfast Sharp had some , hand in it; he's bad enough for anything, s although I caunot see any motive for him T to commit so vile an act as this." "Nor I either," answered Frank. "Still r it must be either he or Bearem, but we have - no evidence against either, what can we do? t -but stop-yes, I'll make one more trial- s I'll know whether-"Frank did not stop ' to finish the sentence, but with a strange    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6833-00000030"/> expression in his eyes which suddenly wl brightened and flashed. he caught up his en hat and rushed from the room.  It was evening, about seven o'clock, and th John Bearem had just finished his dinner. an He dined at five o'clock. for John Bearem ta would have as soon thought of discounting af a note of hand without security and without tl a slight addition to the regular interest, as al le would have dreamed of dining at an w earlier hour than that on which fashion had cl set the seal of what is called true gentility t and aristocratic custom. So John Bearem b dined at five o'clock, and the eating of the tl whole day seemed with him comprised in s that one mneal. The markets of the city of a New York, are acknowledged by all whose 1 prejudices do not blind them to the truth, b not to be inferior to any in the world, in the r quality and variety of the articles which I they offer for the gratification of the palate.  John Bearem always ransacked the the New York markets through and through, and the  consequence was that the results of his daily t gastronomic researches, after having passed l through the hands of a French cook, whom c he paid at the rate of twelve hundred dol- 1 lars per year for his science, produced  every day, at five o'clock, a feast at  which Mr. John Bearem might, if he felt  so disposed. gorge on every delicacy  which could tempt the appetite, and soar, c if his digestion happened to be good, into the highest heaven of gastronomic pleasure. John Bearem was generally thus disposed to gorge himself, and as his stomach was of the same iron mould as his soul, his digestion was generally in prime order, and he might therefore be said to soar every day into the heaven of the epi- cure, with an eagerness and regularity which would seem to show that it was the only heaven he ever dreamed of, or which it was probable he himself thought he would ever reach. John Bearem had thus gorged himself, and was thus soaring up to his heaven, on the evening to which we re- fer-the evening of the day when Frank Noble had held the interview with him at his office in order to discover if he knew    what had become of Eva May, John Bear. em had eaten turtle soup; he had eaten fish, flesh, fowl and game; he had varied the performance with a number of minor and highly seasoned side dishes; he had taken just one glass of the finest sherry, after his soup; he had finished a whole bot- tle of Champaigne while he was stowing away the heavier part of his dinner ; and he was now leaning back in his chair, with the cloth withdrawn from the table, and a bot- tle of old Madeira, flanked on either side by dried fruit, olives and nuts, standiug on the shining mahogany between him and his solitary guest, who appeared about the same age with himself, and who presented to the light very much the same comfortable, brokerage cast of face. Mrs. Bearem had retired with her lady friends, and John Bearem and his brother broker were alone with their wine and in their glory. It must not be supposed that John Bearem or his companion, although they had through the whole course of the dinner been drop- ping wine into themselves as into bottomless i cisterns, and were still dropping it as slow- - ly but steadily as ever, were either of them I in the slightest degree intoxicated. They t had hard heads as well as large stomachs, t and knew exactly how much they could carry as became gentlemen, without des- , cending to the vulgarity of getting drunk. They never exceeded this quantity, at least "in the early part of the evening, the rule s being that in the later hours of the night, or s rather in the small hours of the morning, s when even gentility is not supposed to be e curiously observing, even gentility itself o Imay lose the centre of gravity, go so faras i- to see double, or sleep in sottish insensibili- y ty, without violating the laws of propriety. e  The bottle was at length empty, the last h drop in the glass of Bearem has disappeared ie with a prolonged smack down his throat, is and the last drop in the glass on the op- to posite side of the table had disappeared in e- like manner and with the like ceremony ik down the throat of his companion. Both at now rose, Bearem's companion, expressing w 'his intention of going to the opera, and   Bearem himself remarking that an engage- ment of a private nature would deprive him that evening of the pleasure of accompany- ing him. Bearem did not state the nature of his engagement, but his guest, with a knowledge, which to men of this kind seems to come by intuition, understood the engage- ment to mean that John Bearem was about to go where he could render his heaven of eating and drinking several degrees more intense by the addition of an exciting draught distilled from the life-blood of fe- male virtue, beauty and modesty, and fla- vored with the concentrated essence of un- alloyed human sensuality. Mr. Bearem's guest, however, was not so impolite as even to hint that he was possessed of the above knowledge concerning the private engage- ment. John Bearem walked complacently down Broadway, smoking a cigar, and not omit- ting to look impudently into the face-of every woman he met who by her form or dress struck his fancy. Onward he thus went until he reached Broome street, round the corner of which he turned. A female of majestic figure and stately bearing, neat- ly but gaudily dressed, with a thick veil drawn tightly over her face, turned the corner after him, and passing hastily before him, then slackened her pace, and looked back coquetishy, as if to invite him to ac- cost her. John Bearem was ready for any adventure of this kind, and being particu- larly struck with the bearing of this wo- man, he accepted the invitation. "Withdraw your-veil; I know you must be beautiful, and I would drink in with my eyes your charms." Bearem's Madeira had made him slightly poetical. "I cannot, dare not, here in the street, where I might be recognized. I am not the common walker of the street as you sup- pose; nevertheless I desire an interview with you; I have followed you for that pur- pose," was the woman's answer, in a voice that puzzled yet fascinated Bearem to such a degree that he determined to follow her wherever she should lead. * Come," she said, "I have my carriage   just below here on the corner, once insid that I will unveil, and we can ride to my own house, where I shall be happy to re- ceive a visit from you." The adventure began to incrase, ;" piquancy ;"My carriage," and "my house," were something out of the usual run of all the street adventures in Bearem's previous street experience; and the lady spoke it in such a lady-lilke, easy sort of manner, that Bearem's curiosity prevailed over his pru- dence, and assailing her with a perfect shower of the small talk of gallantry, which she answered in the same vein, he walked beside her until they reached Varick street, where a carriage, which the woman with the veil intimated was the one which she had mentioned, stood in waiting. With- out a glance at the driver, whose face was well muffled, or an attempt to note the car- riage so that he might know it again, Bear- em, carried away by curiosity, and inflamed by a passion which was increased by mys- tery to a degree almost of madness, handed his charmer into the carriage and then leaped in himself after her. How easy it is for any one in this world to be mistaken, but most especially easy is it for him to be mistaken who first drinks a bottle or two of wine and then takes a jump in the dark after a woman.  John Bearem, broker, found himself, when he leaped into the car- riage, to be unpleasantly illustrating the truth of this latter aphorism of wisdom. Lured in the street by the blandishments of supposed beauty under a mysterious veil, he expected when he gained the inside of the carriage, or very soon thereafter, to have fallen into the soft arms of a real beauty with its veil removed. He was, however, slightly mistaken. Instead of soft arms he fell into a pair of hard ones which enclosed his body as with a vice of iron, and instead of the removal of the veil which concealed the supposed beauty of his deluding companion of the street, he experienced on his own eyes the sudden application of a thick and tight veil which brought real and palpable darkness to him- ,self, while the application of a gag to his    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6833-00000031"/> mouth prevented effectually his expatiat- i ing either in a low or loud voice on the na-ne ture of the prospect before and around an him. The fact was that John Bearem had fen fallen into the snares of a modern DelilahI ha and the only advantage which he felt he wl possessed over old Sampson, under similar circumstances, was that he had saved his en hair. This salvation of his hair might have he been owing to the fact that his Delilah had w not looked upon him quite in the light of a al modern Sampson.            w "Be quiet as a lamb, my old buck, or I'll s blow your brains out," was the pleasant d whisper of a voice directly in front of Bear- t em, ald at the same time he felt on his 1i forehead the impression of a small circle of t cold iron, which he had no difficulty in pic- a turing to his imagination as the end of the  muzzle of a pistol. This last was sufficient i for Bearen ; it was the security for a pro- mise to pay, which he could not dispute, I and accepting it at once he became lamb- ( like in his nature, according to direction, , and suffered without resistance his own l hands to be securely tied by another pair  of hands which evidently belonged to the arms which had captured him. Onward rolled the carriage in the dark- ness, whither Bearem of course could not conjecture. After that first whisper which had been so conclusively enforced, not an- other word was spoken, and in the dread silence terrible fear crept through all the veins of the captured broker. What did it all mean? who were his captors? where were they taking him, and what were they intending to do with him? Was it some victim of his own, whose life-blood he had drained by usury, or whom he had outra- geously cheated in some respectable Wall street fashion, and who was now about to take revenge in some terrible manner, or was it the avenger of some victim of his libertinism, who was about to murder him? Bearem could not answer any of the ques- tions which he put to himself in regard to his situation, with any degree of satisfac- tion, for various transactions of his life rose up before his imagination in such colors, as   involuntarily at the present moment to con- nect themselves with the idea of retribution, and the lips of John Bearem quivered with fear even to the gag in the mouth, and his hands trembled even in the strong fetters which held them together, Suddenly the carriage stopped, and Bear- em, with a cloak thrown over him, was helped from the carriage, and forced for- ward, between two persons, through what appeared to him to be a narrow alley paved with rough stones. After proceeding a short distance in this way, he was then led down a flight of stone steps which seemed to him very uneven and slippery, as if they lormed the exposed and neglected entrance to a cellar. The next thing he became aware of was a sudden pause in their pro- gress, and the voice of one of his compan- ions beside him saying in a low tone- "To JUSTICE and POVERTY against VIL- "AINY and WEALTH, open wide the DooRS of VENGEANCE!"These words were ac- , companied with a light tap on what ap. 1 peared to Bearem to be a broad surface of r iron, and he shuddered as he listened, for e visions of a new Inquisition rolled before his imagination in terrible array. Bearem next heard the sound of bolts t drawn back and doors opened, and then be- 1; ing again forced forward, he heard the doors i- close behind him and the bolts again shoot d to their places. The next moment the fet- e ters which bound his hands were suddenly it taken from them, the bandage torn from his re eyes, the ga ,rom his mouth, and he found My himself standing in a full blaze of light in ne the centre or a paone which struck him id with mingled astonishment and fear. a-  It was a square and moderate sized apart- "ment, with the walls on ali sides together to with the ceiling, thoroughly concealed by or heavy folds of black drapery. A table lis covered also with black cloth, ran along the a? upper end of the room, and behind this, es- three men, clothed in black robes and their to features completely hidden by masks of red ac- velvet, were seated. On one of the sides of mse the room, and not far from the table, there as was an apparatus well calculated to shake   stronger nerves than those of Johu Bearem. is There was, first, a low platform covered e with black, and about large enough for a c man to stand upon, and directly over it, tl suspended from the ceiling and apparently r coming through it, was a rope with a noose f at the end of it-the apparatus was no more or less than a gallows; and Bearem gave e another shudder as he looked at it. A man t also with a red mask and his arms bare, t stood by the platform of the gallows, and c seated on chairs on either side of the room, I were ten more men robed and masked like s those at the table.  Such was the scene in the centre of which  John Bearem found himself, when his hands  were loosed and his bandage was removed.  He was not a coward, but he was mortal,  and his soul sunk within him as he looked  around him in the deep and fearful silence which prevailed, and added to the terror of  the scene. "John Bearem, broker of Wall street," ' at length said in a deep voice, the centre person of those seated at the table, "you  are before the tribunal of the BRETHREN OF r JUSTICE, who administer justice and execute vengeance for the poor and friendless, when the regularly instituted courts of law fail to do their duty. Courts of law, even in this laud of freedom as well as in lands of oppression, do sometimes when Wealth and Influence are opposed to Poverty and Friendlessnes, fail to uphold the Right, and it is then the BRETHREN OF JUSTICE inter- fere to redress the Wrong. In your case, the courts of law have as yet, in one act of villainy perpetrated by you, failed to pun- ish you; and in aid of our own designs we have brought you here-Jolhn Bearem, have you anything to say!" During this address of him who appeared to preside over the proceedings, Bearem had somewhat recovered the strength of his nerve, and even under the threatening and ominous appearance of things around him, he began to grow angry, that he, John Bearem, should thus in the city of New York, be dragged before a secret and self- constituted tribunal, to answer for his act-   ions. Perhaps some of the courage which enabled him to get angry, was owing to the conviction which passed through his mind, that they would not dare to injure however much they might threaten and endeavor to frighten him. "; I have to say," boldly answered Bear- em, "that I recognize in this self-made tribunal of justice, as you call it, no right to question me ou any subiect or take note of my actions, and also to say that you had better drop this mummery, and return me safely to the street from whence you took me; remember, if you dare to injure me, there are those who will avenge me: no such association as this, can long in this free country escape detection, and its members receive terrible punishment for the deeds of violence which they may commit. The days of the Inquisition are passed, remem- ber that, sir," and Bearem's courage, as he concluded, was several degrees higher than when he commenced. "We have nothing to do with the Inqui- sition," answered the President, in the same deep voice as before, "we are here only to redress wrong, and we will do so, for we have sworn it. Brethren, do I say aright?" A solemn " aye!" broke from the mouths i of all present, and the President then con- f tinned: "John Bearem, expect no mercy if you I fail to answer truly the single question I which we shall put-where is Eva May?" Bearem started, his courage evaporated; , and with a trembling voice, he answered: f "I know not." - "Vile man," continued the President, s ' you must know; it is you who committed , the foul wrong against her, you must be the man who committed,the second; answer d then, truly, or we shall proceed to extremi- n ties." s  Bearem still persisted in his ignorance, and d the perspiration rolled in large drops from 1, his forehead, as the conviction came over n him that his judges were in earnest. v  Amid the deep silence which now follow- f- ed, the President made a sign, and the man t- who stood by the gallows came forward,    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6833-00000032"/> holding in his hand a curious looking instru-' f ment, the most striking part of which to p the eye of Bearem, was the screw on which h all its motions seemed to depend. Another sign from the President, and before Bearem F exactly knew what they were doing with a him, he felt his thumb tightly compressed d and a sharp, quick pain, intense in its agony, shot through his whole system. It was  with difficulty that he could suppress a cry, h but he did so, and then the President was E her,rd repeating the question;    U "Where is Eva May?"        t "I know not," was Bearem's answer, and 1 this time the blood forsook his face, and his ( whole frame shook like an aspen leaf.- t Again the relentless screw was turned, and s the agony which followed was insupport- i able-his face turned purple, the veins on E his forehead stood out like ropes, and he l would have screamed with anguish had not c a gag at that moment been applied to his  mouth to prevent it. Again the screw was relaxed and the gag withdrawn, and the deep voice of the President again repeated: "Where is Eva May?" And again John Bearem answered with a feeble voice, "I know not." "Officer! the PLITF)ORM and the ROPE!" now said the President, turning to each of his companions at the table, and then look- ing down the line of masks on either side of the room, as if for approval. "Aye! the PLATFORM and the ROPE!" came in answer, as the knell of death, from behind each mask. Then the blood run cold in the veins or John Bearem; his knees knocked against each other as he threw himself upon them on the floor, and with quivering lips he cried- ' Mercy! mercy! I swear before heaven that I know not where the girl is. Spare my life. I'll give you money-thousands if you ask it, only spare my life, spare-- " "Where is Eva May?   Officer! your duty-the PLATFORM and the RoPE!" rose in the loud and solemn tones of the Presi- dent, interrupting the supplications of'the wretched Bearem, and the hands of the of-   ficer on the person of the latter and the ap- plication of the gag to his mouth cut short his further cries. And now John Bearem stood on the PLAT- FORM, and the ROPE was around his neck, and his fear had given place to passive despair. The President raised his finger; a slight noise, as if of the turning of a crank, was heard behind the drapery in the rear of the gallows, the form of Bearem rose slowly up until his toes were left just touching the platform; the face of the broker turned livid and his toes convulsively scratched on the platform-a half of an instant, and the rope again descended, and Bearem again stood on his feet, supported by the official in the mask-the color slowly returned to Bearem's face, the gag was removed from his mouth, and then again from the Presi- dent, breaking the death-like stillness, came the question: "John Bearem, where is Eva May?" And still the answer was, given in a more feeble tone than before, "I know not." "Give him the GOBLET," said the Presi- dent, "he faints." The official took from the President's ta- 'ble a glass goblet filled, apparently with water, and put it to Bearem's lips. He - drank it eagerly. Another sign from the President, and the rope was again adjusted around the victims ' neck, and this time the gag was not ap- I plied "Let the curtain fall before his DEATH f AGONIES; the BRETHREN OF JUSTICE, wish t not to look upon them," said the Pesident. a  "Let the CURTAIN FALL," was the re- e sponse from under each mask, and scarcely were the words spoken before a heavy black n cloth fell slowly before the PLATFORM and e the ROPE. s  A death-like silence for a moment follow- "' ed, there was heard the same creaking r sound, as of the turning of a crank, then a e half choked exclamation, "I know not-I i- know not," and then all again was the si- e lence of death. &amp;-   *   *   *   e   e   Morning was just beginning to break over  the city, and on the steps of a splendid man- sion, a middle aged man, with disordered dress of the finest materials was holding on to the ornamented rails, and apparently just awaking out of a sleep. He stared wildly around, but his senses did not seem to col- lect themselves into any available shape for bis own use. "Helloa! old fellow, get up, stir around and go home i you're out late," said a man with a star on his breast, taking hold of the shoulder of the man on the steps and giving him a rough shake. "What do you mean, sir? Keep your hands off me, sir!" said the man ou the steps, rising and recovering his senses by means of the rough shake on his shoulder. "Do yau know who I am, sir; but stop, you're a police officer, and you must listen to what I say, sir. I have been dragged be- fore a secret hellish tribunal last night, sir. I've had the thumb screw put on me, sir, and I've been hung, sir-yes, hung, sir!" and John Bearem, for it was no other than he, alive and safe, fairly stamped on the pavement as if he would have broken it, so great was his excitement and rage. The police officer gave a loud laugh, "Hung, hey? Well, come, that's a good one," he said. Now, I shouldn't wonder if you could tell exactly how it felt; that's what I've long wanted to know. The fel- lows they hang in the Tombs never come back to tell; how does it feel any how? You see stars, don't you? You must have seen 'em, for it's my private belief you've been drunk all night. Hung, indeed, that's a good one, d- d if it aint; I've been a officer five years-taken up all sorts of drunken fellows-drunken gentlemen and drunken loafers-there aint much difference between the two when they're drunk; they've all awful stories to tell-have seen all sorts of things and doue all sorts of things; but you're the first one I ever heard say that he had been hung-ha! ha! ha! Why, man,you^ve got the delirium tremens. You must have been awful drunk last night. Come now, let me see you home,   and the sooner you get to bed the better." The broker for a moment was furious; he raved, he stamped and he swore, and acted as if he really had the delirium tre- mens. Suddenly, however, he recovered his self-possession, and his dignity coming to his aid, he cooled down, erected his form toa more stately bearing, and slipping a piece of money into the officer's hand, he said : "There, never mind, my good fellow, I'll get home myself," and giving himself a shake, he left the officer and walked forward towards his own house with a gait in which a straight line seemed to be fighting with a crooked one. Strange to say Bearem found that his house was not far off, and he let himself in as quietly as possible, muttering vengeance on the TRIBUNAL OF THE BRE- THREN OF JUSTICE. The police officer looked after the retreat- ing figure of the man who had been hung  he even followed him, and when he saw him ascend the steps of his own house, he waited until he had entered, and then he went up and read the door-plate. "John Bearem is it?" said he to himself, coming down the steps and returning to his beat. "I've heard of him-rich as thun- der, a real gentleman; but he was awful drunk last night, sure. Hung-ha! ha! ha!" While the above scene wts passing far up Broadway, two persons were standing on the corner of Broadway and Canal street, in earnest conversation. One was Frank Noble and the other was a young man of slim and delicate figure and face, but yet with an air abouthim which showed plainly that he was no effeminate boy. "Well, Frank, I managed that woman with the veil business first rate, didn't I? you ought to have seen old Bearem follow, and how he pressed my hand as I took his arm, oh, it was rich, and no mistake." "Yes, Harry, you did manage it well," answered Frank Noble, " every thing wte managed well, the Etna Hose boys in their red masks did well, and I flatter myself as President of the "BRETHREN of JUSTICE "    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6833-00000033"/> I did well, why I began to grow frightened' ti myself; that sleeping draught you gave er him just before the curtain fell acted like a charm ; he was just waking up at the he right time, when we left him on the steps re not far from his own door. But Harry my he heart is sadder than ever, ithas all amount- tl ed to nothing. John Bearem does not know b where Eva May is ; if he did, he never could e have gone through that ordeal without tel- N ling-no he really thought he was going in to die, and he spoke the truth, I am con- s vinced. What shall I do next t"   sC "Are you not afraid Frank," said the i other, " that Bearem will kick up a muss about this BRETHREN OF JUSTICE busi-  ness." "Not in the least, he will be afraid to, i make any noise about it. The policy of 8 John Bearem is to keep still in all which c relates to Eva May; and besides he has not ths slightest evidence as to who the persons a were who composed that awful TRIBUNAL of the BRETHREN OF JUSTICE, which so nearly fr ghtened him to death.-No, my dear fel- low, the BRETHREN OF JUSTICE have had their first and last meeting in old Nat Bum- her's cellar, and no more will be heard of them except among ourselves, believe me. Bye the bye, that enormous quantity of black muslin that we used had better be taken care of, for it will come in good play the next time the FireDepartment may have occasion to go into mourning; as for the red masks, the Brethren who wore them will doubtless find use for them at balls or in some other way-but come, it's getting broad daylight, and we had better be going home; good-bye ;" and Frank Noble and Jis friend separated. The advertisements in the newspapers, and the handbills offering rewards for the discovery and production of Eva May, were of no avail: the searches of the police of- ficers were equally without any successful result; a journey to Greenburgh by Frank Noble, and an interview with Holdfast Sharp, were entirely unsatisfactory, and a week passed over without bringing any   tidings of Eva or the least clue as to wheth- er she was dead or alive. Darker and darker grew the gloom in the home of the Noble family. Ephraim Lanky recovered but slowly, for the grief at his heart preyed upon his body and retarded the cure of his wound. Aunt Dora's face, hitherto so placidly cheerful, became cloud- ed with a settled shade of sadness; old Mrs. Noble seemed paralyzed, anxiously watch- ing the countenances of her daughter and son, but scarcely giving utterance to any sound except heavy sighs, and seldom mov- ing from her chair; while Frank Noble himself, in the fierce agony which raged in his breast, became moody and restless in his manner, starting at every sound, his eyes at one moment flashing as with the ' kindling of some new hope, and at the next s ettling back into the dull and heavy look of despair. It was night, just one week after the dis- appearance of Eva. The clock had struck. f the hour of eleven, and Aunt Dora and V Frank Noble, who had been for some time ' talking with Ephraim Lanky in his room i previous to bidding him good night, had not ' yet left the apartment. f  "I shall never see that dear child again,  never, never," said the schoolmaster, look- f ing up despondingly into Aunt Dpora's face, lt as she settled the pillow more easily under Y his head and bid him good night. e  "Never despair," was the mild answer; e ", the darkest hours are often the heralds of "the brightest," and whispering of hope n Aunt Dora left the room. g  The schoolmaster gazed steadily and g with deep reverence on her retreating form d until the door closed upon her, and then he shut his eyes tightly as if he would force s, himself into a visionary realization of t he le truth of her cheering words. Frank Noble re also, who at the moment of Aunt Dora's if- departure was looking gloomily out of the ul window into the dark street, pressed his ik hand convulsively to his forehead as if to st strive to compel himself to believe that id. there was s'. me consolation in what she had ly said. And thus while the weak old man on   the bed and the strong young at the win- dow, each in his own way, strove eagerly to catch and retain the gleam of hope kindled by the gentle and ministering voice of a woman, a deep and ringing sound broke abrubtly on the stillness, jarring the win- dows and causing both the sick and weli man to start from the intensity of their thoughts. "Fire! fire!" feebly cried the school- master with a shudder, as he half raised himself in the bed and then sank back mur- muring to himself, "Oh, how fearful to lose any one by fire; but Eva, poor Eva, perhaps she died a more awful death," and the schoolmaster clutched the bed-clothes nervously with his hands and drew them over his face. "Aye, fire fire!" exclaimed Frank, his breast suddenly heaving and his eyes flash- ing with fierce excitement; " perhaps amid its roaring flames, I shall forget my own burning thoughts. But compose yourself, Ephraim, I'll be back soon. Aye, fire! fire! I hail in you a short respite from my- self." With these words he rushed from the room, and in scarcely three moments afterwards, fully equipped in his fire dress, he was runni(ng through the streets with a speed which cleared the way before him, and caused many to pause and look in as- tonishment. Clang! clang! clang! breaking out on the air of night, measured and solemn, ponder- ous and startling, sounds the great tire bell from the watch-tower of the CITY HALL.- Clang! clang! clang! close and jarring on the ear, far off and away over ridge upon ridge of black and huddling' roofs now stretching out in the distance in long flat squares. and now heaving up in peaked and fantastic forms bristling with battle- ments of chimneys, as with grim and ghostly sentinels from among which here and there arches up the smooth and span- ning dome, and here and there shuts up the tall and tapering spire; clang! clang! clang! over broad streets gleaming with myriads of lights, over narrow and foul lanes and alleys, creeping away in the 6   darkness, and still onward and over a thick forest of white masts and furled sails rock- ing silentlyon the waters, and encircling as with a belt this vast panorama of roof and dome, and spire, street and alley  clang! clang! clang! over curtained rooms where on beds of down joyous hearts are beating peacefully, and tearless eyes are tranquilly closed in deep and refreshing sleep, over bare and cheerless garrets and dark damp cellars, where on beds of rags haggard men, women and children are huddled together, groaning and tossing in the uneasy and feverish sleep of squalid penury and hunger, over brilliant abodes of wealth and luxury, where gleaming mirrors are flashing the reflections of gold and silver, of stately forms of men and beauteous forms of women, of silks and satins, lace and glit- tering jewels, where the feast is spread, where the fairy feet are tripping in the giddy whirl of the dance, and where the sound of music and of mirth is high, over dazzling saloons where voluptuous licen- tiousness is reveling in the mad orgies of the wine cup and unholy passion, and where the dice box is rattling, the cards are shuff- ling, and curses of despair as if from the in- fernal world are rising loud and deep, over dark holes reeking with the fumes of rum, where men like fiends are yelling, cursing and fighting, where knives and pistols are gleaming, and blood is flowing, and where * murder stands triumphant above his victim, or skulk;s appalled from the scene of gore, ,over bedsides where heads are bowed and hands are clasped in thanksgiving praise and prayer to Heaven, over secret places where black and scowling brows are bent in consultation on plots of crime, and over darkened halls and storehouses, through which the thief is stealing in search of plunder, over bed-chambers where smiles and low breathed congratulations are around the pale and happy mother at whose breast the new born infant is nestling, and over bed chambers where tears and stifled sobs are around the winding sheet and marble features of the dead-thus clang! clang! clang! measured and solemn, ponderous    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6833-00000034"/> and startling, close and jarring on the ear, yet far off and away over the whole island city of New York, its mingled, calm and raging sea of wealth and poverty, joy and misery, virtue, vice and crime, life and death, sounds the great fire bell from the City Hall, and up in an instant from every street and lane, and alley arise the frantic yells of " fire," "fire," joined with the rumbling noise of heavy engines tearing over the stones, with sepulchral voices coming through the throats of hundreds of brazen trumpets, with the swift clatter of countless iron heeled footfalls on the hard pavements, with the quick sharp ringing of bells in churches and bells in towers-all in one frightful chorus, rending, the vault of   the skies and echoing below as if an army of demons were let loose. And away over yonder black line of roofs and chimneys, broad sheets of flame shoot up amid clouds of smoke, forming an expanded circle of light in the centre of the heavens, andleav- ing the rest of the canopy of the sky hung with a funeral pall spreading dark and heavy over the island city where Fire the Destroyer is sweeping on to ravage and devour. Bend thy feet, Frank Noble, to the race and thy muscles to the rope, shout loud the cheering fire-cry through thy silver trumpet, and let not thy strength or courage fail as the big sweat drops fall like rain from thy brow, for the Fireman is the Saviour.   CHAPTER XIII.   THE DUNGEON AND DESPAIR.-THE KNIFE, THE FIRE, AND THE RESCUE. In her dungeon cell deep in the founda- tions of the "Emigrant's Home" in Frank- lin Square, sat Eva May, pale and haggard,  on the edge of her wretched bed, her hands clasped convulsively together over her knees, and her face upturned with an ap- pealing expression of intense agony, asif in her despair she looked alone to Heaven for aid. IOn the floor beside her was a pitcher of water and an untasted dish of bread and meat, and there was no sound to break the stillness of her agony as it sought relief in the speechless and mental prayer. For hours thus she had sat, and the mo- ments stilled rolled on, end yet she stirred lot. Suddenly she sprang from the bed and walked up and down her narrow prison house, wild with the realities of her awful s;tuation ad it seemed to rush over her soul, burning into it like fire and driving reason to the extreme bounds where it meets and is iost in insanity. "Oh. God," she cried, "I shall go mad, mad, mad. What shall be my fate? I shud- (er and my soul recoils. Frank! Frank! my noble and loved betrothed husband, where are you in these fearful hours. Fly! fly! to save me; but no, you cannot hear my voice-there is no aid. Oh, my God! my God! I shall go mad! mad! mad!" And the unfortunate Eva threw herself again on her bed exhausted with her heart throbbing as if it would break in its fierce struggle, and her wild ravings giving place to low and piteous moans. Thus had it been for six long days with   Eva in that dungeon cell, where she could not mark the time, but where years of ago- ny seemed to have rolled over all her be- beinL, Each day had been like the former -hours of gloomy and moody despair, and speechless prayer, followed by hysterical fits of almost insane raving. At regular intervals came the deaf and dumb jailor, and deposited her food and drink, and she had knelt and appealed to him by signs, but the guttural chuckle or grunt accom- panied by signs which she could not under- stand, and by a shake of the head, which told her there was nothing to hope, were the only answers. And it was now the ear- ly part of the seventh day, just one week from the night on which she had entered her prison. Eva had not lain long in the position in which we have last described her as throw- ing herself, when the trap door above opened and the deaf and dumb jailor enter- ed. It was unusual for him to enter the cell except to bring to her waLer and food, and as he had already but a short time be- fore performed that office, Eva started up with a feeling of new dread and terror creeping over her and turning the blood in her veins into a current of ice. When the deaf and dumb jailor had reached the bottom of the stone steps, he looked cautiously up to the trap door, as if he feared he might be followed, and then he advanced slowly towards Eva. She re- coiled, at first; but something strange in the look of the deaf and dumb jailor-a look which betokened no evil towards her, but softened, as much as his hideous fea- tures could be softened, into a kind and    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6833-00000035"/> encouraging expression, caused her to v pause in her backward step, and her feeling t of terror somewhat to subside into a feeble I ray of hope. When within a pace of Eva, the deaf and dumb jailor paused andt pointed with his long and skinny finger to E a livid welt which run down from his fore- a head, across his cheek, which appeared to l have been freshy made, and which Eva ] now for the first time noticed. As he point- } ed his eyes suddenly glared with a savage - vengeance, he c!enched his fists until the a blood almost started from under his nails,  and he made violent passes in the air as if  he would annihilate some imaginary enemy.  Again Eva:s terror returned, and again  she shuddered and recoiled. In an instant, the deaf and dumb jailor seemed to notice the effect which his looks and actions produced on Eva, and the sav- age glare of his eye vanished as quickly as it came, his fists became relaxed, and he threw himself at Eva's feet which he kissed as if they had been those of a God, while again and again he looked up and shook his head violently and quickly as if he meant to tell her that she had no harm to fear from him.  Then he sprung once more erect, pointed again to the livid welt on his face, then stretching one arm stiffly down in front, as if holding some one firmly in his grasp, he made motions with his other arm as if dealing swift and heavy blows with a whip. Eva understood her jailer to mean that he had been beaten heavily, and that the livid welt was the result. Her fear again left her, and she signified, by bowiug her head, that she knew perfectly his mean- ing. The eyes of the deaf and dumb jailer brightened as he seemed to perceive by Eva's mute answer, that he was understood. Then he threw himself again on his knees, not this time to kiss her feet, but to kneel and raise his eyes exactly as he had often seen Eva do, when he came to bring to her the food. And then again he rose, went up to Eva; caught hold of her arm; pointed up to the trap-door : gave his hand a back-   ward sweep as if he would leave with her the cell behind, and an upward sweep, as if he would carry her out. A wild and tumultuous joy immediately thrilled through all the veins of Eva, as she read these last unmistakable signs of an escape in which he would aid her, so plainly made by her deaf and dumb jailor. Forgetting in the delirium of her joy the hideous and revolting appearance of the deformed being before her, she threw her arms around his neck and burst into tears, then, the next instant, she again recoiled, but with no shudder of aversion ; but bend- ing on him a look of intense gratitude, raising her outstretched hands towards Hea- ven, and then extending them towards him as if she would shower down blessings on his head. The Deaf and Dumb looked steadily at his prisoner, put up his own arms around his neck where those of Eva had rested, and a tear glistened in his eye: a ray of intelligence seemed to flash vividly across his countenance, and the deformed lump of humanity appeared to lose half its hide- ousness in the deep sensibility that had so suddenly gleamed over his nature. Eva, her face bright with the hope of delivery, awakened in her heart, now .ap- proached the motionless jailor, and gently ' drew him towards the stone steps as if to re- i call him to the work before him, and to tell him that she was hastening to go. t  The deaf and dumb jailor felt and under- e stood Eva's touch, but he in his turn drew i her back, and shook his head in token that r tshe could not go. Then he went towards - the bed, laid himself down upon it for an in- stant and closed his eyes as if feigning sleep. r Then he rose again, knelt and worked his y fingers on the floor as if he were piling up sticks, then struck his knuckles together as , if striking a light, then blew on the floor as 1 if he were kindling a flame, then threw his narms wildly above and around him as if the r flames were raging, and then again catching p hold of Eva, he gave towards the trap door i an upward sweep of his hand similar to the - one which he had previously given when he   first intimated that he would aid his prison- er to escape. Again Eva plainly understood the mean- ing of her friendly jailor-understood him to mean that at-a later hour the hour of sleep, he would set the house on fire and make that the ocaasion of her escape. It seemed to her a fearful deed to commit, and that the life of herself and perhaps others might be its result. For a moment she thought she would refuse to go, and endea- vorto dissuade him from his design, but the remembrance of her lover ; of her friends, Ephraim Lanky and Aunt Dora, and the fearful thought of the certainty of the horrible fate which awaited her if she staid, shook her half formed resolution and determined her to brave any risk rather than remain, if she could avoid it, in her dungeon cell. Putting up a mental pray- er, that no harm might come from the deed and that no life might be destroyed in order that her own might be saved, she justsfied to herself the jailor's plan for her deliver- ance, and bowed to him her acquiescence. With more quickness of motion than he had ever before exhibited, the jailor sprang up the stone steps, lifted the trap, and disappeared. While the above scene between Eva and the deaf and dumb jailor was in progress in the dungeon cell, Blear-eyed Jake, Holdfast Sharp and Runyon Dooal were seated in the large apartment of the "Emigrant's Hcme," where Eva May's grandfather had died, and where his will, as we have before related, was fraudulently made by the parties to whom we again introduce the reader. "Well, Jake," said Holdfast Sharp, rub- bing his hands with evident, satisfaction as he spoke, " you have managed this business excellently well; that Jack of the Cross must be a devil of a fellow, almost as bad as you, hey, Jake ; bnt you are sure Jake he never saw me; I don't care that he should, a I have before told you. it is not at all necessary, and might be inconvenient. "All right, Squire. "answered Blear-eyed Jake, "Jack of the Cross has never clapped eyes upon you up to this moment, that is to   know you, take my word for it, Squire, for I'm a man of my word." "Yes, yes, Jake," said the lawyer, "I'll take your word, so the girl is all safe down there." And Sharp pointed with his finger to the floor. "Yes, safe, as stone ana a wood and iron trap door, which is at much as one man can lift when it's unfastened, can make her, never fear." "But, Jake, it seems very strange that you have never, so at last you say, been down to see your bird in her stone cage. How do you know she's safe?" asked the lawyer. "When I said I had never been down to see her," answered Jake, "I didn't mean to say that I had never had a peep at her, of course I have; I've seen her every day, just raised the trap to look at her; but you see, Squire, I've not been down to her-I'm tender hearted, Squire, and I thought it was no use in my listening to her prayers and seeing her tears, until it comes to the last pinch of carrying her off to the ship. It was much as I could do, Squire, to gag her and put her into that cell at first. Besides, there is no occasion for me to visit her. I've got a first-rate jailor to take care of her. He can neither hear nor speak, he's deaf and dumb: it aint the first job of the kind he's done for me by a long way. I took him some years ago from an emigrant wo- man who died soon after landing from the ship. I knew I could make him useful, and so I've fed, and lodged, and clothed him, and I've not been mistaken ; he's as faithful as a dog, although he's sometimes ugly, as all such fools are, and I have to flog him sometimes. I flogged him to-day pretty hard because he made me mad, and he's been good as apple pie ever since." "Well, well, Jake, that is all proper; you know how to manage your own busi- ness, and there is no danger, that I can see, from the deaf and dumb boy; but to-night is the one appointed for Jack of the Cross to take her to that ship, we spoke of, and and I suppose everything is arranged. Here is the money for the Captain," and Hold-    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6833-00000036"/> fast Sharp as he spoke laid a bag of coin o on the table. "Yes, all's ready, and to-night at 12 o'clock she will be safe and sound aboard co the ' Sea Tiger,' bound for some port that th it is unnecessary to mention," was the an- swer of Blear-Eyed Jake. "I will now leave you," said Sharp, ris- e ing, "but will see you to-morrow again.  Come, Dooal, let us be going." "I'm ready," said Dooal; "but I am getting squeamish about this business. It  seems to me that we have got too many fin- gers in the pie."  "Pshaw, Dooal," returned the lawyer, "don't show your white feathers now, for it happens to be a little too late. You should have thought of it before you put  your finger in. Remember, Dooal, I did not ask you."  The cat-eye of Dooalrested a moment on  the hawk-eye of Sharp with a peculiar ex- pression as he answered.  "Don't be alarmed, my squeamishness was only a passing feeling, I shall be on hand, you may depend to the end of this business." Having uttered these words, Dooal bid Jake good night, and Sharp hav- ing followed his example both left the room, and Blear-eyed Jake was alone. Blear-eyed Jake did not rise from his chair until some moments had elapsed, but kept his gaze steadily fixed on the bag of money before him on the table. When he did rise, he took up the bag, opened it, ab- stracted therefrom about a handful of the coin which was gold, and put the handful into his pocket, and then proceeded to count the remainder, muttering to himself as he did so: "All this kind of yellow corn that passes through my mill, must pay toll. It's no more than fair." Jake had not been long engaged in count- ing the money, when a band was laid on his shoulder, and the hand was heavy and firm. Jake started to his feet as if a thunderbolt qad fallen by him, and turned to grapple with the intruder, but he met only the face   of Jack of the Cross, and, sinking down on hls chair, he said faintly : "Where in the name of the devil did you come from, Jack, and how did you get into this room?" Jack pointed with a smile to the panel through which Runyon Dooall, as the read- er will recollect, once had made a similar entrance to the same room. "Oh-yes"' stammered Jake, "I remem- ber-but how did you find it out?" "I always find out what I want to, my hearty," answered Jack. '; I'm an old hand at traps and springs and secret panel doors; I've been in old castles and all such places as well as on board of ships. I'm up to snuff, Mr. Blear-Eyed Jake; I'm an old salt, as the sailors say, in more ways than one: I found that panel door out in a way that it is none of your d-d business to know, but I'll tell you. I'se got an odd way of cruis- ing about on land just as I cruise about at sea, and I always cruise about whatever house I happen to be in. I've cruised about B the 'Emigrant's Home' considerable; I should have found out sooner or later that i dungeon cell down below there, even if you 3' hadn't told me about it and showed it to r me. Now you see I was on a cruise about , the 'Emigrant's Home" this evening, for you see that knowing this to be the night is we are to take that gal to the ship, I knew it that you would be after having a talk with )f our lawyer friend, whom you have never ie introduced me to, and who was exactly the b-man I wanted to see for future reference. he So you see I dogged you, Blear-Eyed Jake; "I saw you and Sharp enter this room, and I nt cruised around to see if I couldn't hear what eyou said. I stumbled into that little dark closet yonder by merely opening it with an ;es instrument I always carry about me, and no looked through the little hole there because I couldn't help seeing it, and I saw and nt- heard all you did, and in fussing about his there I found a knob that I knew must open m. a secret panel door, for I knew no man olt would be fool enough to make such a hole ple without having a door to match it, and be- ice ing used to such springs, why, I merely   opened the door as easy as can be, came in, s and here I am-Blear-Eyed Jake, you can't n get ahead of me, Jack of the Cross." tl "I swear I believe I cant," was Blear- fi Eyed Jake's answer.          a "And, therefore, Jake," continued Ja li of the Cross, "I'll follow your example f and take a handful of toll out of that yel- d low coin, which is passing from lawyer E Sharp's mill to the hands of the Captain of e the Sea Tiger; it's no more than fair play, t Blear-Eyed Jake," and Jack of the Cross  scraped up a handful of gold from the e table.  "It'scoming it rather strong on the Cap- a tain's pile," said Blear-Eyed Jake, hesita-  tingly, but yet not daring to offer any re-  sistance.  "Then you must make it up out of your own pocket, Blear-Eyed Jake," said Jack of the Cross, putting into his own pocket e what he had taken up. "Well, I suppose there's no help for it,"  answered Jake, resignedly; " but come, Jack, it's time for me to run down town and give this to the Captain, and get him ready. I'll be back in an hour, and then  we'll both go down to the cellar, give the gal a sleeping draught and off with her to the ship," and the ,two worthies separated. Blear-Eyed Jake Aeft the house and the. deaf and dumb jailor watched him from be- hind the door, and remained there until he saw him returning, and saw him go up with Jack of the Cross to the apartment next to the closet of the panel door. Then the deaf and dumb jailor entered the closet as if it was a place familiar to him, looked through the same hole through which had looked Dooal and Jack of the Cross, and saw the latter enter an adjoining and secret passage which he knew led to the dungeon cell. The mute minister of vengeance, quickly drew a match from his pocket, lighted it, and applied it to a strange little heap of combustibles which he had evidently prepared beforehand. It caught slowly at first, and when satisfied that it had, he pushed back the panel, advanced into the room, closed the panel again quickly, and   stood still in the centre of the large apart- ment. A few moments passed, the eyes of the deaf and dumb jailor remained steadily fixed on the panel, when suddenly there was a crackling noise, smoke issued through the little hole and filled the room, and a bright flame followed through the hole. Then the deaf and the dumb man laughed, his eyes glared again with the same savage expre- sion which they had before flashed forth to the sight of Eva in the cell, and with a bound and hideous guttural cry he bound- ed into the secret passage, gained the trap door of the cell, lifted it as if it had been a feather and descended. Our scene changes to the interior of the cell into which we left the deaf and dumb dwarf just on the point of entering. Eva is standing in one corner of the cell, her eyes staring wildly, and her whole form quivering and shrinking before the advance of Blear-Eyed Jake and Jack of the Cross. Blear-Eyed Jake holds in one hand a glass, while the other is extended towards Eva as if he intends to enforce whatever he may wish her to do. Jack of the Cross is passive beside Jake, but evidently ready to assist Jake in the scene about to be enacted. "Drink this, foolish girl," said Blear-Eyed Jake. "It won't hurt you, it will do you  good; you've got a long journey to go to- night, and there's no use resisting, drink." "Oh spare me, fearful men!" cried Eva, i dropping on her knees; "Spare me, and "Heaven w;ll bless you. What have I done e to injure you that thus you should seek my ,3 life. Spare me! spare me! spare me!" a  "Why no one's a going to hurt you, gal, d I swear it; drink, and make no more fuss i about it." t "Never," answered Eva, rising from her n knees, and the despair which was falling in' ;, thick darkness around her, giving to her a t, strength to overcome her fear and assume a e more calm and firm demeanor, "Never!- y murder me, do with me what you will, I1l y pray for strength, but I will not drink." e  "Come on then, Jack of the Cross," said ie Jake, with a fiendish determination flashing kd up the natural dulness of his bleared eyes    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6833-00000037"/> "Come on, we've got rough work here to  do, and we must do it, by h-11, we've gone j  too far to stop; you hold her down, Jake, while I pour the liquor into her throat: she must be quieted, or we can't get along." Jack of the Cross growled out a savage "aye! aye!" and advaneed towards Eva.* The unhappy girl did not shrink ; did not move ;but summoning up allher resolution bhe extended her left hand towards her as-  sailant with a commanding gesture, while she clasped her right tightly over her breast. Every particle of blood had forsaken her face, but there was not the slightest tremor in her frame, there was no quiver in her lips, and the expression of her large black eyes was one of sublime resignation ming- led with a determined resolve to prevent her fate if possible; but in any extremity to meet it courageously. "Back! back! men of crime and blood,  if you would avoid the vengeance of Hea- ven which will most surely fall upon you, if thus you harm  the innocent. Hea- ven has thunderbolts, and here, if die I must, I call them down on your heads, they will come, as sure as there is a God whose laws you thus outrage; they will come! they will-" "Ha! ha! ha!" yelled Jack ot the Cross, preaching hey! my pretty bird, but it won't do with me-here goes," and with both his arms stretched out, he sprang upon Eva. With a movement quick as thought, Eva' drew with her right hand, from the bosom of her dress, a small hammer rusty with age, but still perfect and capable of being made to give a heavy blow if rightly wielded. The hammer had dropped by accident from the pocket of the deaf and dumb dwarf, as he ascended the steps of the cell after his last interview with Eva, and she had picked it up and concealed it in her bo- som, with the iaint hope teat it might at some time prove of-service to her. The time had come sooner than she expected, and with the cry of *' May Heaven help me," she raised the little weapon, and at the sanie moment when she felt the hands of Jack of the Cross upon her, she brought the hammer with a   well directed blow full upon his temple. It was a woman's feeble hand which had struck, but the strong man was conquered-Jack of the Cross fell on the floor dizzy and stunned. The above scene occupied but a moment, and in an instant afterwards, Blear-Eyed Jake, throwing the glass from his hand, had rushed on Eva. In vain she struggled in his grasp, in vain she strove once more to strike with her weapon-she was an infant in the giant grasp of Blear-Eyed Jake, who wrenched the hammer from her hand, and bore her with resistless force on the bed. Pressing his knee upon her breast, and clutching her throat with one hand in such a manner as to hold her hand firmly down,  he drew with the other hand a coil of rope from his pocket and a gag. He raised the gag, and was in the act of thrusting it into her mouth, when a smell of smoke aud fire caused him to turn his face behind him.- But he was too late. A misshapen form with eyes red and gleaming like two balls of fire, was on his back with the crushing pounce of a tiger, a knife glittered for an instant ubove his head, and then descended full, straight, keen and piercing into the back of his neck. He sprang up convul- sively, but the misshapen form still clung to him and fell headlong with him to the floor, but fell uppermoet. Then once again the knife glittered in the light of the cell, and again descended into the back of Blear- Eyed Jake, where it was turned and twisted for an instant as if to make the wound sure in its deadly-effect. A slight quiver passed over the body of Blear-Eyed Jake, and then with a convulsive bite of his mouth into the pool of his own blood where his face had fallen, he died. With an unearthly sound, half way be- tween a shriek and a guttural chuckle, the deaf and dumb dwarf jailor, for it was he' who had dealt the avenging blow, sprang from the body of Blear-eyed Jake and rushed towards Eva. She had fainted.- Pausing not an instant, for the cell wasfast filling with smoke, and the sound of the crackling of the flames above, mingled with the shout of voices, was distinctly' heard   through the open trap door, he dashed the'  whole pitcher of water into the face of Eva, I and then throwing her insensible body on  his shoulder, he staggered up the stone 1 steps with his burden, casting only a hasty  glance on Jack of the Cross, who at that  moment rose bewildered and unsteadily to to his feet.  "A thousand devils," yelled Jack of the Cross, as the smoke, sound of the fire, and the sight of the pool of blood around the dead body of Jake brought him completely to his senses, " a thousand devils are the demons of the infernal pit let loose? Jack of the Cross save yourself or you're lost- how that cursed cross burns into my fore- head." With these words Jack of the Cross rushed up the stairs of the cell after Eva and her rescuer. Meanwhile the fire kindled in the "Emi- grant's Home," was performing its work of destruction. The whole upper part of the dwelling was in ablaze, and already the flames were curling up amid clouds of smoke from the roof. Within all was con- fusion and dismay. Frantic men and wo- men, many of them half dressed, were rushing down the stairs through the stifling smoke, screaming with fear, or shouting for help, and the firemen, in their red shirts and glazed hats, with cheers of encourage- ment were forcing their way fearless of danger into the very teeth of the roaring flames, and rescuing and aiding the terri- fied inmates and their property, as far as they were able. Outside the building, the scene was fear- ful, but possessed of that awful sublimity which fascinates the attention, while it causes the beholder involuntarily to shud- der as he gazes. Revealed with a startling distinctness in the light of the burning flames, a vast crowd of men, women, and children, pressed and surged and heaved, around the "Emigrant's Home," blocking up the streets, trampling over the long black lines of hose which crossed the pave- ments at every turn, and now and then sent up jets of water from some rent or joint,   wedging in the engines where the firemen with measured strokes forced the water with whizzing streams into the roaring furnace, and yelling and shouting as some blackened beam or portions of the roof fell in with a crash and sent up from the fiery abyss sheets of flame to the heavens. And to the crowd without, the inside of the building was revealed with the same vivid clearness. At one moment, forms of fire- men like dark shadows might be seen pass- ing and repassing through the rooms, or mounted on the tall ladders, leaning into the windows, and directing hose pipe, with its stream of water, full into the midst of the flames, and at the next moment, out from every window darted forked tongues of fire, curling up and licking the outer wall, and seeming in spiral columns to embrace into destruction both ladders and firemen. At one of the intervals when the blazing was confined to the inside, and when what was passing within could be distinctly seen, two shadows approached one of the win- dows of the second story. The vast crowd for a moment held their breath, stricken and paralyzed with dread and fear, for in the light of the flames, the two forms were seen to be those of a deformed dwarf, staggering and fast sinking, and of a female resting in the arms of the dwarf, her limbs relaxed, and her face ghastly pale as that of the dead. The death-like stillness, of the terror- stricken crowd was broken by a loud cry of "Eva May," and the ,next moment the figure of a fireman rushed forward, willing hands were at his back, and in an instant afterwards a ladder scaled the wall, rested against the window, and Frank Noble was on topmost round. As a giant would take a child in his arms, Frank took the insensible form of Eva from the shoulders of the dwarf, and with a firm step descended in safety to the pavement. The dwarf follow- ed with difficulty, but he also safely reached the bottom round, and then the crowd re- gained their breath ahd sent up a deafening cheer for the rescued and the rescuer. It was but the work of a few moments to    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6833-00000038"/> convey Eva into a neighboring drug store and to bar the doors to the entrance of all  except the deaf and dumb dwarf, and a few  of Frank's friends belonging to the Etna l Hose Company.             t Frank Noble bent over Eva in breathless  suspense as restoratives were applied and v every means were employed to bring her to consciounless. He called her by every en- dearing name that his deep love for her could summon to his lips and implored her for a that great love to live once more. Slowly, and with a struggle of the coming breath, as if death was fighting fiercely for the victim which he had already considered his own, the pulses of life returned to Eva, her breathing became regular and audable, and she opened her eyes. The sight which met her wild gaze of bewilderment was an elec- tric shock ofjoy to send the stagnant blood bounding with strength through her veins. With a loud cry of "Frank! Frank! thank God! thank God!" she sprang up, threw her arms tightly around his neck, and sob- bed and wept upon his bosom. There were few dry eyes among those who witnessed the scene. It seemed, how- ever, to have the strongest and at the same time a strange effect on the deaf and dumb dwarf. His eyes dilated to their utmost tension, his misshapen figure shook as it under the influence of some deep emotion, and when Eva uttered the cry with which she threw herself on the neck of Frank Noble, he started as if a faint sound had fallen on his ear. When Eva had in some measure recover- ed her composure, and while with maiden modesty she was disengaging herself from the embrace of Frank, the dwarf rushed up to the latter, clasped his knees, and I joked up, first at Eva and then at Frank, with an appealing look for protection.   "Who are you, my brave, unfortunate fellow, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude, for without you this maiden would have perished," said Frank, now for the first time addressing the dwarf. Eva laid her hand on Frank's arm and whispered, "He is deaf and dumb, Frank, and my preserver from a fate worse than fire-he must go home with us-I will tell you all about it when we reach home." A carriage having been procured, Eva, together with her two rescuers, soon reached the house of Mrs. Noble, in East Broadway. As they entered within the door, all invol- untarily lookedup to the sky in the direction of the "Emigrant's Home," and from the small dull circle of light which they beheld over the spot which had so lately with its columns of raging flames, illumined all the heaveqs, they knew that the fire had spent its force, and that the "Emigrant's Home," was a pile of smouldering ruins. "Heaven be praised that I once more see and hold you in my arms," said Aunt Dora, folding Eva tightly in her embrace, and looking upward with the tears trembling in her eyes, and a gentle smile of mingled joy and thankfulness irradiating all features. "Yes, Heaven be praised," cried Eph- raim Lanky, repeating Aunt Dora's words, and springing up half erect in his bed, while in the fever of his excitement the color rushed glowing into his wan cheek, "Heav- en be praised, Aunt Dora is always right;  ,he bright hour, heralded by the darkest, has come! Eva-Eva is here-thank- thank-" but the weak frame of the school- master could bear no longer the excess of I joy which had come so suddenly upon him, and he swooned in the arms of Eva, who rushed forward to support him.   CHAPTER XIV.   REMORSE AND REPARATION.    de OTR scene changes to a spacious brown co stone house in the upper part of the city of we New York. The building, although merely co a square one, was not wanting in architec- fa tural beauty and grandeur. The caps and ar lintels of the windows presented handsome to carvings in stone, the entrance was under a o lofty portico supported by four Corinthian o columns, and on the entablature of the por- o( tico there was carved a coat of arms. Al- cl together it bore unmistakable evidence of it being the abode of a man of great wealth; 1e and probably, from the shield over the door b a foreigner. To an apartment in this man- tl sion, furnished on all sides with oak book 1 eases filled with books, and elaborately carved in the Gothic style, we introduce t the reader on the second morning after the v night of the burning of the "Emigrant's 1 Home." In a large morocco covered arm- chair, by a rosewood writing-table in the a centre of the room, the owner of the man- c sion, an elderly man, was seated, his head c bowed on his breast, his eyes listlessly fixed i on the carpet, and his whole attitude one of  complete abstractionfrom all that was pass- ing around him. His countenance, as he thus sat musing, was not pleasant to look upon. His face was long and thin, his com- plexion sallow, his eyes grey, cold, and deeply sunken in his head; his nose hooked, and his lips wearing a bitter and forbidding curve in their expression. Deep wrinkles ploughed his cheeks and fore- headand his whole look was dark and gloomy. He might have been a hand- some man in his youth, for there was noth- ing in the outlines of his features to ren-   der such a supposition improbable; on the contrary, his face seemed one where the workings of fierce passion through a long course of years, rather than any inherent fault of feature, had left harsh, care-worn, and disagreeable traces behind. Opposite to him, in a deep bay-window of the library opening on a flowery garden, a young man or rather boy of about fifteen years of age, occupied another morocco covered arm- chair, and was engaged in carelessly look- ing over the morning newspaper. The si- lence which reigned for some moments between the man musing at the table and the boy reading in the window, was at length broken by the latter. "Father! just listen to this," exclaimed the boy, and then from the newspaper which he held in his hand, he read as fol- lows: "Our readers will recollect that in the  account which we gave yesterday morning -of the fire which, on the previous evening, consumed the building known as the 'Emi- 1 grant's Home,' in Franklin Square, we t' gave a description of the rescue of a young - girl from the flames by the heroic exertions e of a fireman named Frank Noble, the fore- k man of the Etna Hose Company. We have - since learned that the name of the girl is d Eva May, and that she is the same person e whose mysterious abduction some short d time since created such excitement in this p city. She is a foundling, and was found e- when an infant by thi side of the dead body d of her mother at the door of the County - 1 Poor House in the town of Greenburgh not h- far from this city. She had already passed n- through a number of surprising adventures    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6833-00000039"/> before this ast one of her abduction, wtich is the most strange and surprising of all. She is represented as being very beautiful, I and as brave and virtuous as she is hand- some. There is a deep and impenetrable mystery connected with her abduction, and foul play of no ordinary degree of atrocity is expected to have been resorted to, for what purpose there is yet no clue to disco- ver. In digging under the ruins of the 'Emigrant's Home' yesterday, the work- men found, crushed aud mangled, under the stones in the cellar, the remains of what is supposed to have been the body of Jacob Snifen, or Blear-Eyed Jake ashe was called, the landlord of the hotel. We have not yet been able to ascertain full particulars, but we hope for the sake of justice the mat- ter will not be suffered to sink into oblivion, and that the authorities will take the most energetic efforts to discover the villany, if there has been any, and bring the offenders to justice. We look for strange develop- ments in this affair, and if any should be made we shall place them before the reader at the earliest moment." "Well, there, father, that's odd enough, isn't it?" said the boy in the window when he had finished reading the above account. "Very odd, quite as bad as anything we read of in the London papers; only to think a handsome girl stolen, and the next place she turns up at is at a fire at an Emigrant boarding house kept by an awful fellow, no doubt, for he has the horrid name of Blear-Eyed Jake-and then there's a touch of romance in it, too, because she is saved just in the nick of time by a brave young fireman. Why, father, it's as good as a new novel; how I long for the " further developments," as the newspapers say, and by Jove I should like to see the girl too." The elderly man at the table whom the boy addressed as father, had only slightly elevated his eyes when his son had at first begun to read. As, however, the boy pro- ceeded, the attention of the father had be- come intently fixed, his eyes flashed with a strange eager expression, his breast heaved, his whole frame seemed agitated with some   powerful emotion, and at the conclusion of the reading of the account in the newspaper, he had remained gazing fixedly on the read- er without heeding apparently the light re- marks which the latter made by way of comment on what he had read. In making these comments, the boy did not look up from the paper which he held, until he had uttered the last word of his speech, when he threw down the paper, and jumping up as if to leave the room, then noticed for the first time the strange appearance of his fa- ther.  "Father! father!" he exclaimed, running up to him as he spoke and taking hold of his hand; "what is the matter, you seem agitated, speak, shall I ring the bell, are you unwell?" and with a frightened air the son moved hastily towards the bell handle. "Stop, my son," said the father in a firm voice, recovering in a moment his compos- ure, "it is nothing, I had a slight rush of blood to my head, which you know I often have, but it is over now. I am perfectly well -there, go and take your morning's ride, as there is no recitation, in your college to- day-go, I wish to be alone," and the father very deliberately turned, as if nothing had happened, towards the table, arranged a sheet of paper and prepared to write. The son, as if he knew the man exactly with whom he had to deal, left the library with a simple " good morning." "The Governor is in one of his queer spells to-day," said the boy to himself as he took a seat in a handsome light wagon, behind a full blood horse, and drove off to get one of his college chums to take a ride with him. "I wonder what is the matter with the old fellow anyhow-for a year past he's had just such queer fits-I hope my father isn't getting poor, for it's a horrid thing to be poor, and I could never stand it-but no matter, there's plenty of money on hand yet, so go it "Two-Twenty," hur- rah for a little bit of a spree out at Bloom- ingdale this blessed day, when a fellow hasn't got any recitations to bore him," and with these words, the young man gave, after the most approved jockey style, a loud   "heigh," to his horse, whom he had address- ed by the title of "Two-Twenty," and "Two- Twenty" whirled him and the wagon out of sight at a rapid rate, but not quite per- haps at the speed of a mile in two minutes and twenty seconds. Two fine specimens of boy-men dined that day at one of the many fashionable hotels on the Blooming- dale road, imbibed, much to the elevation of their spirits and the sinking of their wis- dom, an excellent bottle of inspiring cham- pagne, from the celebrated French vine- yards in the State of New Jersey, and then dashed back to the city with ' Two-Twen- ty" clearing the road before them, and in a two-twenty state ofjollification, which found its crowning joys and honors in the third tier of the theatre, and in a general cruise about town until near daylight. Of these two specimens of riding, frolicking and drinking boy-men, the son of the elderly owner of the brown stone mansion was un- doubtedly the finest. In the meantime, the elderly man, whom we left in the library of the brown stone mansion, did not proceed to write, as he ap- peared to be on the point of doing when his son left the room. His head relapsed again on his breast. and he murmured to himself: "Strange! strange! strange! can it be? it may-I hardly dare hope, but I will solve the doubt, and if it should be, accept, oh my God, my heartfelt thanks, and help me to show my gratitude by endeavoring to make some atonement for the sin I have commit- ted. It was an awful-awful sin-remorse gnaws my heart-can it be that the bliss of making some atonement will be vouchsafed to me? I feel, that he who sins must even in this life bear the penalty of his deeds- oh, how the remembrance of that cruel deed eats into my heart, and turns all this wealth and grandeur around me into bitterness and gall." 4s he thus spoke, he rose and passed out of the room with a slow and heavy step, nrd soon afterwards left the house in his carriage. On the same morning there was a scene of happiness in the house of Mrs Noble, in East Broadway. Eva May wasseated in an   arm chair between Ephraim Lanky and Aunt Dora. Frank Noble still lingered from his work, although the morning was fast waning. He was sitting on a low stool looking up into the face of Eva, and listen- ing with wrapt attention to the story of her sufferings, which she again for the third or fourth time was repeating. Old Mrs. Noble also rocked herself contentedly in her chair and listened with a pleasant smile illumining ' her aged features. The face of Eva was pale, but joy danced in her large and lus- trous black eyes, and joy, full complete and perfect, was in the hearts and glowing on the countenances of all in the fireman'u home, to which the lost and rescued one had been brought back in safety to those whom she loved and by whom she was be- loved. Eva was the magnet which attract- ed the undivided attention 'of all present but Ephraim Lanky, who seemed to be in a quandary which to look at the longest and with the most tender glances, Eva or Aunt Dora-he loved Eva with all his heart, but Aunt Dora, when he looked at her, seemed to him to take up his heart with Eva in it off he did not know exactly where. We believe that very few persons, whether young or old, who are in love have any more wisdom on this subject than the poor schoolmaster. The scene of happiness which we have above disclosed was broken by a loud and impatient knock at the door, the cause of which Frank Noble hastened to ascertain. A few moments afterwards, Frank return- ed into the room, accompanied by the eld- erly man whom we introduced to the reader in the beginning of this chapter as the owner of the brown stone mansion in the upper part of the city, and whom Frank now in- troduced into the circle of his home as Mr. Eustace Delany, who wished to speak with Eva on a subject of importance. Mr. Delany gave but one glance at Eva, and before he could utter the usual saluta- tion of politeness, his face became deadly pale, asd he sunk, completely overcome by some sudden emotion, on a chair which Frank hastened to place for him.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6833-00000040"/> The agitation of Mr. Delany was but mo- a mentary, and recovering himself, he said: i "Excuse this emotion, its cause I will  explain at once, for I have come here on a  solemn business, which requires a plain ( straight-forward course. My name, as Mr. Noble has already told, is Eustace Delany. I have wealth far beyond my desires, at my  command, and I hold a high position in the society of this city. I am, however, not an American by birth, but an Englishman. I  was born in the city of London, born to wealth and high rank in society. In early life I became acquainted with a beautiful girl named Eliza, daughter of a wor-  thy man named John Moreton. I wronged that girl, deserted her, and emigrated to this country. I here married into one of the first families of this city, and for some time, in the new scenes by which I was sur- rounded, forgot even the existence of her against whom I had sinned. Even al- though Eliza Moreton, the victim of my deceit, followed me across the ocean with a love and devotion which my treatment of her, atrocious as it was, could not diminish or destroy, although in poverty and despair, with the fruit of my sin, a helpless infant, at her breast. she claimed shelter and protec- tion at my door, I closed that door against her with the spirit of a fiend and a heart of iron. The remembrance of that night comes over me now, burning into my soul like fire and crushing me to the earth be- neath ,he heavy weight of a just and re- tributive vengeance-but to my story. I turned Eliza Moreton and her child-my child, from the door, and went onward in the race of ambition which I had marked out for myself in the new country which I had made my home. Money I had in plen- ty, but I wished to be a leading spirit in a land of freedom. I was successful; I hae - taken my seat in the Legislative Halls of this nation, and I am now looked up to as one of the men of mark in the land. And with all this my wealth also has increased; but all my increase of wealth and all my fame have brought with them naught but misery. It may have been that the high   and ennobling pursuit of studying and identifying myself with the sublime princi- ples of freedom as developed and carried out in this country, has had the effect to change my once hard, proud and unfeeling nature-it may have been this, it may have been the death of my wife, it may have been the direct finger of heaven softening a guilty conscience and stubborn nature, or it may have been all of these-which I know not, but this I know, remorse has seized me, and the one great object for which I now live is to find Eliza Moreton if she be living, or her child if she herself be dead, in order that I may make what atonement I can for my sin. I have read this day in the paper that you, Miss May, are a found- ling; a strange hope sprung in my heart that you might be my child. I have come here to know the iru'h, and I feel that I am right: the eyes of Eliza Moreton are now looking from you on me-one question and all doubt will be resolved into certainty- have you a red mark in the shape of a diamond on your left arm-if so you are my child and I own and acknowledge you before all men. H-" The further speech of Mr. Delany was here interrupted by a faint shriek from Eva, who the next moment swooned in her chair. While Aunt Dora threw her arms around her and Frank Noble rushed forward to her assistance, Ephraim Lanky, although still weak from the effect of his wound. rose firmly on his feet, and stretching out his long arm between Eva and Mr. Delany who also advanced towards the latter, said in a tone of mingled solemnity and command: "Stop, Eustace Delany, touch her not.- She is your child-Eva May is your daughter; the mark you speak of is on her arm as it was on that of her mother; the resemblance between you and her is suffi- cient without the mark to establish the iden- tity-Ifeel that she is your daughter, but yet you must not touch her, for she is also my child-mine by adoption, mine by long years of a father's love which I have felt for her, and a father's care I have extended over her in poverty and suffering. It isnot I   enough that you acknowledge her, for al- though she is the child of shame she is noble and virtuous, and until she acknowledges you I shall not give my consent for you to embrace her as your daughter. She must first forgive you for the awful wrong you committed against her mother, and which has cast the dark shadow of suffering over her young life." "Sir," answered Delany, falling back, "Sir your gray hairs and the position in which I find you with regard to my daugh- ter are sufficient to tell me that you are right; I am justly rebuked-behold me, I kneel to the daughter of my shame and ask her forgiveness-can remorse and sincere repentance do more?"And Eustace De- lany, the proud man of wealth, utterly sub- dued by the better and nobler feelings which had taken possession of his heart, threw him- self on his knees before the Foundling of the Poor House, and asked her to remem- ber no more the wrong he had committed; but speak the word of pardon and own him as her father. The eyes of Eva slowly opened, she had heard the petition of her father, and in an- swer she fell weeping on the neck of the kneeling form before her. And Ephraim Lan- ky, his ungainly form and plain features as- suming a look of sublimity from the act in which he was engaged and the emotions which glowed in his countenance, stretched out his hands over the father and his child, and his lips quivered as with a blessing too deep and sincere for utterance. And Aunt Dora leaned on the back of Eva's chair and she too wept, while Frank Noble turned 1aside to hide the tear which he felt trickling down his cheek. And in the midst of all. with noiseless step the deaf and dumb dwarf, now cleanly and nicely dressed, glid- ed into the room, and clinging to the school- master's knee, looked on the scene with a half startled, half inquiring gaze of won- der. It is needless for us to dwell on the story of Eva, as related by Ephraim Lanky to Mr Delany as soon as all had recovered their composure after the above affecting scene.   He related all the particulars of Eva's life, from the time of finding the infant Eva by the dead body of her mother on the threshold of the County Poor House up to her rescue from the fire. At the conclusion of the nar- rative Delany said: "' As for John Bearem's villainous act to- wards my child, in the Church street affair, although my anger is strong enough to cause me to take the laws into my own hands, yet under present circumstances, as I can throw the shield of my position around Eva, I think we had better suffer all legal proceedings against him to drop-I shrink from exposing my child to the gaze of a public court-room, and the insolence of law- yers, and there only receive for her justifi- cation a verdict of so much money-if the law would put John Bearem into state prison the case would be different; but I am sorry to say, that I believe that John Bearem Is too rich for the law to inflict on him any such penulty, although his crime had been murder. But there is one thing that weighs heavily on my mind-I mean this abduction business. It is evident from what you say, that Bearem has no hand in this-but who has, and what could have been the motive -and what could this Blear-Eyed Jake have to do with my child, that he should thus seek, I fear, her life. Mystery, all Imystery-oh that thathrave deaf and dumb dwarf who preserved you, could speak; for you yourself tell me you have not the slight- est clue to unravel the mystery-well, we must wait; there is some dark villainy be- hind all this, that time alone can reveal. But come, my child, I have opened my heart to you, I now open my house to your adopt- ed father and to this poor speechless unfor- tunate. Henceforth my home and yours shall be theirs. As for you, Mr. Noble, and your worthy sister and mother, you have a home of your own, but my most sincere gratitude is due; you will alwrys be wel- come guests in my house, and your fortunes, Frank Noble, will be one of my chief cares." It was arranged that Eva May, together with Ephraim Lanky and the deaf and dumb dwarf, should that afternoon take up their    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6833-00000041"/> abode in the mansion of Eustace Delany, as heir f'uture home, and with this understand- ung, Mr. Delany left the house of Mrs. Noble, a happier and a better man than when he entered it-his remorse had given place to   'joy, and in the sublimty of penitence and act of reparation, he rose to that true dignity of manhood which neither mere wealth or social rank can either give or take away.   CHAPTER XV.   TWO NEW MOVES IN THE GAME OF VILLAINY- THE MOVE OF A VILLAIN LAWYER, AND THE MOVE OF A LAWLESS VILLAIN.  "Tins business of Eva May, it strikes me is getting rather complicated; don't you think so, Dooal?" As Holdfast Sharp addressed these words to Runyon Dooal, he stripped, with a rather nervous motion, the feathers from a quill which he held in his hand, and fixed his hawk-eye very intently on his companion. It was late at night, and Sharp and Dooal were alone in the private office of the former, at Greenburgh.  "Yes, I should rather say it was," an- swered Dooal, returning with his cat eye the gaze of Sharp and not winking in the least. ' I should say that the business had become very complicated; that it has, to use a legal phrase, a vast quantity of sur- plussage about it which could be very well dispensed with without in the least injuring the case. The case. asI take it, now stands as follows:-Eva May is found, and she is found under very unpleasant circumstances, not only to herself but possibly for us; Blear-Eyed Jake is dead, but Eva May has seen him, and can describe him, and she can tell that he and that Jake of the Cross were the ones who abducted her and who were going to use violence to her on the very night of the fire; and then the ques- tion may come up, what were their motives? and then somebody in the Surrogate's office may read in the papers all about Eva May, how -she wa ,s a loundlinig, &amp;c., and then thely maly tih'n to tao l:t cnr:(d will of old Mar .:"' s .. : ] 1 1.' ,4r'.,ttc's books and   find Holdfast Sharp s name, and then they may put the story in the newspapers and the will and Holdfast Sharp's name togeth- er, and then possibly they may find out something like very strong motives and something like a very strong clue to un- ravel the whole mystery, all of which will not be very pleasant to Holdfast Sharp, Esq., nor to your humble servant, Runyon Dooal; and then there's that infernal deaf and dumb dwarf who has been saved and who if he cannot speak may make signs if he should ever happen to see Jack of the Cross and Holdfast Sharp, and there is also Jack of the Cross himself who may turn up suddenly and unpleasantly, although it is to be hoped he was burnt up, too-the business is very complicated and full of surplussage." "Bah!" exclaimed Sharp, and his lip curved in a scornful smile and his hawk-eye twinkled bright and keen, "Bah! you are not quite so smart as I thought you were- Rnnyon Dooal, have you lived so long with me and not know me better? the case is rather complicated, I acknowledge, but it is nothing to a man of science. Now I sup- pose you think I have had that will of old Moreton's recorded, that all the world who might take the trouble to look into the Sur- rogate's office might read it-no such thing; that will is not recorded; I am not quite such a fool. If Blear-Eyed Jake had lived, if the ' Emigrant's Home had not burned down, and Blear-Eyed Jake had taken the girl out of the way, I might then, because Blear-Eyed Jake was in the business and for many other reasons, have proved the will regularly; but Blear-Eyed Jake is dxil^,    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6833-00000042"/> and no one but you and myself know any- li thing about the will, and therefore the will S1 goes by the board and none but you and I D will ever know anything concerning it. I se am hot at all concerned about this matter, except perhaps with reference to this Jack g of the Cross; but even if he is alive, you w remember that Blear-Eyed Jake gave us his Il word, that he, Jack of the Cross, has never a seen and does not know either of us. No, o no, it is all right, depend upon it-Eva May d and her fireman lover have not the slightest a clue to connect me or you with this busi- a ness. But, Runyon Dooal, so far from be-  ing afraid in this business of Eva May, I am  going ahead in it on another tack-listen to my plan. You know that Eva May, although she never heard or dreamed of her grand- 1 father, John Moreton, has found her father  in the person of no less a man than the wealthy and well known Eustace Delany, . of New York, who has acknowledged his own bastard, (for she is nothing but a bas- tard) and has taken her to his house, and is making a lady of her as fast as music teach- ers and all other kind of teachers can do it. Well, Dooal, my son Fred is in Columbia College, New York, and he is a classmate of Delanv's son, who is rather dissipated, but very intimate with my son. I told my son to be intimate with young Delany and all rich men's sons-lend them money if ne- cessary ; he has lent some to young Delany. Now you can see what I am driving at-I mean to strike up a match between my son Fred and Eva May. Fred once married to her has position in society, and wealth, and if anything should come out in the will business, why I'll pay the money, and as it will be a family matter, the affair will be hushed up and never known in the world and to the law, which two places are the only ones I am afraid of as regards my ac- tions. Perhaps you think that my plan is a bold one and that I cannot carry it out. It is a bold one, but I am famous for bold moves, and I think I have science enough to carry this one through." The cat-eyes of Runyon Dooal dilated beyond their usual circumference as he   listened to this long harangue of Holdfast Sharp, and when the latter had concluded, Dooal slapped his hand on the table and said, "I have always thought that you were a good specimen of a keen lawyer, mixed with a slight dash of the villain, but this last touch of yours convinces me that you are sublime--sublime in all the ins and outs of deviltry--you are a Napoleon of deviltry, and it strikes me that you're just about now making a push to cross the Alps, and have laid your plans so much like a Napoleon that I am rather inclined to be- lieve you will get over safely." "Runyon Dooal," answered Sharp quick- ly, "I would thank you not to apply such language as villain and deviltry to me; re- member, sir, to whom you are talking." "Bah!" returned Dooal, "Bah!-I use your own favorite expression, Mr. Sharp, s and I say, bah! There was a time, Sharp, - when I was afraid of you-when you first s got me in your infernal toils and held the - power over me to send me to the state  prison; but I have been something of a Na- a poleon myself in the same line with you, e and I have so managed it that you are as much in my power as I am in yours; and. y therefore, I say again, bah! I am not d afraid of you, so just get down from that - high horse and let us talk together on busi- r ness like just two such villains as we are." I  Holdfast Sharp bit his lips, and as if no- n thing had occurred to interrupt the good to feeling between him and Dooal, said: d  "Of course, Dooal, I shall not fail in "that matter; although, take it all through, it it is the toughest job I have ever had on be hand. But I shall come out all right; and id now let us proceed to burn old Moreton's he will-this burning of his will is the neces- c- sary consequence of the burning of the is "Emigrant's Home," and I have deferred ,t. the burning until you could see it." ld  With these words Sharp drew from his ,h pocket the will and was about to hold it to the flame of the candle when a loud knock ed on the outer door of the office caused both he him and Dooal to start from their seats,   Sharp at the same time thrusting the will' hastily back into his pocket. Before, however, we inform the reader of the nature of this sudden interruption of the proceedings of Sharp and Dooal, we must go back a little in our story, and fol- low the steps of another of one of the char- acters of our tale. On the same night when Sharp and Dooal were holding the interview which we have above described, a solitary traveler was trudging on foot over the post-road leading from the city of New York to the village of Greenburgh. He had reached a point of the road not more than two miles from the village, and the road led through a thick wood. It was a lonely spot, and the trav- eller, apparently tired, sat down on a rock by the roadside, and looked around him as well as the darkness would permit. He was dressed in a thick cloth box coat of a drab color, and the hat which he wore was a glazed broad-brimmed one, with a green lining under the brim. "Humph! Jack of the Cross," muttered the traveller to himself, for he was no other than our old acquaintance of the "Emi- grant's Home," "Humph! Jack of the Cross, this is considerable more of a journey than you bargained for when you started; but no matter, you must heave ahead- Holdfast Sharp is the port you're bound for, and his money locker is the place for your hand to go into-you've had to keep d-d still and dark since that fire, but you must now make a haul and clear for good-clear out to Italy where's there's plenty of wine and women, if you've only got the money, and the money I mean to have-but hold, there's a strange sail in sight," and as Jack of the Cross looked down the road, he saw a farmer's wagon occupied only by one per- son, approaching him. "Avast there, stranger," sung out Jack of the Cross, as the wagon reached the place where he was seated, "Avast there, and give an honest old tar a lift will ye?" "To be suze I will; Josh Bull is not the man to refuse to give any man a lift," was the answer of another old acquaintance of   the reader, even no less a personage than the deposed keeper of the Poor House at Greenburgh. But Capt. Josh Bull spoke in a faint voice, as if he felt that he would have to give the stranger by the roadside a lift, whether he would or not-strange and frightful visions of robbery and murder rolled before the eyes of the ex-keeper of the Poor House. Jack of the Cross deliberately mounted into the wagon, and took his seat beside Capt. Josh Bull, as if the latter had been one of his old and most intimate friends. "Hellow, old fellow 1" said Jack, slap- ping Capt. Josh on the shoulder. 1 Now I s'pose you're a comfortable old farmer,-- plenty to eat and drink, and don't care a d-n for any body, hey?" "Oh, no," stammered Capt. Josh, "I'm nothing but a poor man, poor as Job's tur- key, darned if I aint-so poor that I once kept the Poor House at Greenburgh, and that's darned poor business any how." "Oh, ho!' said Jack of the Cross, " why then I shouldn't wonder but what you knew all about that poor-house gal, Eva May, that they're making such a fuss about in New York ; the gal what's been abducted and like to got burnt up and all that, and what's found her father and all that-didn't you know her, my old cove?" "In course I did; I fetched her up in the Poor House as if she had been my own child; I was tarnation kind to that gal, I tell you, and she ought to remember me now in my poverty-I am going to see her one of these days, darned if I aint; I've hearn tell all about it and I've a notion that she'll help me." And Capt. Josh Bull as he spoke put on a most mournful look, as if he were in the last stages of poverty and required an enormous quantity of as- sistance to get along in the world. "Well now," answered Jack of the Cross, "I am really glad you were so kind to that poor gal; you'll reap your reward, as the preacher says; but, Capt. Bull, I'm d-d sorry you're so poor jusiwnow, but as half a loaf is better than none, just please to de- liver what small change you have about    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6833-00000043"/> you, or I'll be d-d if I don't blow-your t brains out." As Jack of the Cross spoke S these words he held a pistol full against the 1 forehead of Capt. Josh Bull, so near in 0 fact that Capt. Josh felt the muzzle graze t coldly on his skin.          t With a deep groan Capt. Bull put his hand in his pocket, drew out a well filled V leathern purse and gave it to Jack of the I Cross. Capt. Bull had just returned from I New York, where he had received payment ^ for a quantity of grain, and there were one hundred dollars in the purse.     1 Jack gave a loud laugh, which rung X through the woods, as he received the evi- ( dence of Capt. Josh Bull's poverty, and stowed it away in his own pocket. "Now," said he, "Mr. Keeper of the Poor  House, just hold still till I tie your hands behind your back and put a stopper in that ugly mouth of yours." Capt. Bull had no alternative, and in a few moments his hands were fastened by Jack of the Cross securely behind his back, and his mouth effectually closed by his own cravat, which was stuffed into it, and then bound in its place by a handkerchief which was passed round and tied at the back of his head. Jack of the Cross then further bound Capt. Bull to the seat of the wagon, and drove the latter as far into the woods as he could. Here, having secured the horses to a tree, he took ofl his hat and said:- "Good night to you, Capt. Josh Bull, rx-keeper of the Greenburgh Poor House, and so poor himself that he'wants charity- goodl night; a pleasant time till morning, w hen somebody comes along to give you wreakfast-perhaps they won't come along till to-morrow night, perhaps not for a week, for your'e in the woods, Capt. Bull, and no mistake-good night and pleasant dreams. And in the woods, bound and gagged, Jack of the Cross left Ctpt. Bull, and hast- ened on his way towards Greenburgh. "That's the place, I know it from the description I got from Blear-Eyed Jake," said Jack of the Cross to himself, as he en- tered the village of Greenburgh, and saw   the light in the back window of Holdfast Sharp's office. Approaching, he tried to look in the window, but there was a curtain over it and he could not see within. He therefore went round to the front door of  the office and knocked. It was the knock .of Jack of the Cross, which had interrupted the consultation of Holdfast Sharp and Runyon Dooal, at the point where we left those two worthies, and we now therefore return to them. "Come in," said Sharp, advancing into the front office with the candle in his hand and opening the door ; and Jack of the Cross entered. Both Sharp and Dooal were startled at the appearance of their visitor. Neither of them had ever seen Jack of the Cross, and of course did not know him; his ap- pearance, therefore, as he took off his hat and exposed his face, with the hideous mark of the cross on his forehead, was not such as to cause Sharp or Dooal to feel very com- fortable at that hour of the night. "My friend," said Sharp, with a tremor plainly perceptible in his voice," my friend, this is an unseasonable hour for business, and without yours is more urgent than I think it can be, you had better go over to the tavern across the way and come here in the morning, when I will attend to you- we are just now retiring for the night ;" and Sharp still held his hand on the door, as if he expected his visitor would take the hint ' and depart. But Jack of the Cross was not the man to act on a hint. "Squire Sharp, it's my opinion," said g Jack of the Cross looking very coolly around , him, " that you'll attend to my business to- o night,-remember-Eva May-Blear-Eyed i. Jake-stone dungeon-carry her off in the , ship-Emigrant's Home-Jack of the Cross - -all right, Squire! I know you, know your jackal Dooal there-I am Jack of the e Cross-aint quite burnt up, so let us pro- 7 ceed to business at once-all right, Squire i- -smooth sea ahead unless you wish to kick w, up a squall."   Sharp and Dooal trembled-the only man.'  they stood in fear of was before them. "Come in the back office, Mr. Jack of the Cross," said Sharp faintly, and in a few moments afterwards the trio were all seated in that apartment. "Now, sir, what do you want of me?" continued Sharp looking at Jack of the Cross with a troubled expression in his countenance. "Only one thousand dollars-cash on the nail this blessed night-that's all," was the answer of Jack of the Cross, delivered in a careless manner, but with his eye full upon the face of Sharp. "And what if I refuse to give it?" "I'll tell the whole story of Eva May, how I and Blear-Eyed Jake took her to the 'Emigrant's Home,' how we were going to take her somewhere else, and who employed us." "And suppose no one Would believe you, for we have characters; and you from your appearance and talk have none to, boast of." "If that's your lay, suppose you take me into custody for attempting to extort money from you, and try whether no one will believe me-I'm willing to make the trial," and Jack of the Cross gave a smile of scorn. "Well, my friend, answered Sharp, soft- ening his tone, for he saw that he had his match to deal with, " let us understand one another; you want a thousand dollars; now I am willing to give five hundred, which is all the money I have out of the bank." "You lie, you old sinner! I know all about you-you have always plenty of money about you, so shell out or I'll shoot you and Dooal here on the spot-I'm not afraid of man or the devil," and Jack pul- led out two pistols and presented them at the heads of Sharp and Dooal. "You had better iot make any noise either of you," continued the villain, keep- ing his eyes fixed on both of his victims who sat close to each other, " for you're in my power-if you bring the whole town   upon me, I've only got to put up my pistols and tell the story." There was no help for poor Sharp, so he drew out his pocket book and taking a thousand dollar bill from it laid it upon the table. In taking, however, the pocket book from his pocket, Holdfast Sharp also drew out the will of John Moreton, which the reader will recollect Sharp thrust hastily into his pocket when he was interrupted by the knock of Jack of the Cross on the door. The will dropped on the floor, and Jack of the Cross perceiving it, ordered Dooal to pick the paper up and place it on the table beside the bank note. The pistol was not an argument to be trifled with, and Dooal obeyed. The will was no sooner on the table than Jack of the Cross, with a quick movement, replaced his pistols and grabbed both the bank note and the document, and glancing hastily at the latter- "Ha!" he said, "'The Will of John Moreton '-I understand-well, this is bet- ter than I expected; I thought it might be something important when I saw it drop on the floor-good, ha! ha!" Both Dooal and Sharp now rushed to- wards him, but he caused them to pause by the words: "Better not make a fuss-take it easy- I know all about the making of the will- Blear-Eyed Jake told me, and now I've got the will itself-now make as mus'h noise as you please-fight with me for the will, and bring the whole town in this office-I can fight until they come, and when they do come, and I show the will, who is likely to have the best of it? ha! ha!" Dooal and Sharp fell back, and trembling and faint sunk into their chairs. "Now hark ye," continued Jack, "I'm for fair play-leave me alone and I'll leave you alone-I'll not use this will of More- ton's to your injury if you behave your- selves-I shall keep it one week, when I will send you word how and where I will give it up-Good night. and follow me or raise a hubbub after me if you dare." The next moment Sharp and Dooal were    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6833-00000044"/> alone, their lipsblanched and their hearts throbbing wirh fear. "Our only hope," said Sharp, "is to harry the completion of the plan of my son's marriage with Eva May. "Yes," answered Dooal, " our Alps are   getting to be bigger mountains than they were an hour ago, and tnen it was a mighty slippery path when I saw over them. Sharp. you must be a devil of a Napoleon if you cross over them now."   CHAPTER XVI.   A SWITOR REJECTED, AND A VILLAIN FLOGGED.  IT was morning-a bright and beautiful  morning in the wane of summer, when the  mellow air of autumn has just commenced  to blow gratefully on the cheek, and the fiery sun to look down with a more tender  and subdued glance on tree and grass and flower. In the deep bay-window of the li- brary of the stone mansion to which we have already introduced our reader, sat Eva, now no longer Eva May, the unknown foundling, but Eva, daughter of the wealthy and Hon. Eustace Delany. It is just three weeks since her rescue from the fire and the discovery of her father, and two days after the consultation between Sharp and Dooal, described in our last chapter, and as she sits in the deep bay-window of the luxurious- ly furnished mansion,she is somewhat chang- ed since we last saw her in the plain abode of Mrs. Noble. Her fair and open brow, her black lustrous eye beaming with ten- derness, and the sweet beauty of her face, are the same ; the change is only in her dress, which retains still the neatness for which it was always distinguished in the days of her poverty, but has now assumed a form of rich beauty in material and fashioning, which renders that neatness still more re- markable. A flowing robe 'of cambric, ex- quisitely embroidered in open needlework trimmed with the finest lace and rosettes of ribbon, envelops gracefully her form, while the tiniest of lace caps rests floatingly on the back of her head, holding bewitchingly beneath its open threads and letting fal from its fringed border the ricl cluster of ringlets which it has gathered from the silk-   en plaits of her dark hair, parted simply across her brow. Pcerless in beauty looked Eva Delany, as she sat in the deep bay- window, attired in the morning dress with which wealth had clothed her. Eva was intently engaged with a book, seeming more to study than to read it. She was not alone. Gliding noiselessly about the room, now surveying one book case and now another, now taking down a volume, fondling it for a moment as a child would a toy with which it was in raptures of delight, and then placing it carefully back again on the shelf, was our old friend, Ephraim Lanky. Ephraim's arms, as well as his legs, were, as our readers are aware, very long, and as he stood before the cases, sweeping his arms over the higher shelves, very much like the huge beam of an engine in motion, he presented an appearance which would have involuntarily provoked a laugh from a stranger. Even Eva, who was ac- customed to see him from her earliest recol- lection, could not avoid smiling as now and then she looked up from her book, and suf- fered her glance to rest upon him for a mo- ment. At length Ephraim desisted from his gen- eral exploring expedition around the library, and selecting a book, took a seat opposite Eva in the window. "Well, Ephraim," said Eva, (she always thuscalled him by his first name at his a own particular request) "Well, Ephraim, i I suppose you will now have a comfortable r read, as you have taken your usual survey I of the library before commencing " f  "Yes, Eva, I cannot help taking a good - look all around before I settle down. I've    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6833-00000045"/> done it every morning since I have been t here, and I am not tired yet-I shall never 1 get tired. Eva, did you ever read a novel 1 written by a man name Walter Scott, and I called Guy Manneritfg-  Eva smiled as she answered:    * "No; you must remember I have not had many books to read or much time to read them-only time and opportunity enough to learn the simple rudiments of education which your kindness taught me. However, if I try hard now, and improve the oppor- tunities which my father is giving me in every branch of learning, I hope I shall make up for lost time, become an accomp- lished lady, and do honor to the high posi- tion in which iiy father has placed me. After I get the solid part of my education, I suppose I shall read Guy Mannering,'i you say it is worth spending one's time to do so-but why do you ask me the question whether I have read the book?" "True, my child," was the schoolmaster', answer, " we are surrounded here by so much grandeur as a matter of course, that 1 forgot for a moment that we had not been used to it all our lives. and that you had not read everything-singular. isn't it? But I really don't exactly know half the time whether I etand on my head or feet, I am so happy-Eva, your father seems to me al- most a God of knowledge and goodness- just see, here am I by his bounty in this grand house, clothed like a gentleman, fed like a prince, do what I please, go where I please. read as long as I please or what 1 please-I, the poor schoolmaster of Green- burgh-now librarian to the lIon. Eustace Delany; yes, Eva, you needn't draw that pretty little mouth of yours into such a fun- ny ,smile, for librarian is the title your father gave me when he asked me to come and live with him, and when I told him I could not think of living on his bounty without doing something-' Ep!raim Lan- ky,' said your father, ' you shall catalogue all my books and arrange them: I have long wanted it done, and yc:. shall L, nmv librarian.' But 1etween you and me, Eva. I hardly think I shall Lc able to c. ttv I *.   these books, for many of them are in n- - known languages to me, and I shall not know what heads to put them under. How- ever, I am going to learn them, old as I am; for, Eva, this a prodigious library-ah! that word ' prodigious makes me remember why I asked you if you had read Guy Man- nering. You see, years ago I read it. I found an old half worn-out copy in no less a place than the garret of the Poor-House -some pauper had left it there. Well, there's one character in it called Dominie Sampson, who was prodigiously foL d of books, and who always cried ' pro-di-gi-ous!' whenever any thing remarkable occurred around him. Now the Dominie found a benefactor in his old days, because just like me he stuck like wax to a beautiful girl in the days of her adversity, and this benefac- tor made the Dominie the master of a splen- did library in his own mansion, just as your father has me, and when he first entered it, cried out, ' pro-di-gi-ous ' louder than ever; anl I too cry out ' pro-di-gi-ous,' and every- thing around me is 'pro-di-gi-ous '-and this is the reason why I asked you, my child, : you had read the book-you must read it, Eva, for the Dominie was a model of a man." As the schoolmaster thus, in his simple manner, spoke enthusiastically of his present happiness and the kindness of her father which had caused it, tears filled the eyes of Eva, but she smiled brightly through them on her humble friend, as she answered: "I will read the book, Ephraim, for your sake, but I do not think the Dominie could have been a much better man than my dear friend and second father Ephraim Lanky." It now became the schoolmaster's turn to exhibit a glittering drop in the corner of his eye at these words of Eva, but his long fingers brushed it hastily away as he said with a slightly faltering voice. "There was one thing about the Dominie which I don't exactlylike,or rather for wli,::h I was always sorry when I read about him." "And what could that have beten ' a asketdl Eva, a little siirprlisd at thee ci,.;;i \ li:(.h took pIlce in the tchoolilabter's claa [ til.'L..   "He had no-no-wife-he eschewed' marr-marriage," was Ephraim's answer, as his eyes fell on the floor, and the slightest  possible tinge of red suffused his sallow cheeks. "Well, Ephraim what of that? I am sur- prised that you should find fault with that part of his character-you eschew marriage too, don't you? you don't want a wife, do you, said Eva archly. "I don't eschew marriage, and I do wish a wife, Eva," said Ephraim, raising his eyes and speaking firmly. "I am in love, Eva -now don't laugh-yes, I old Ephraim Lanky am in love and dare not speak of it." "Why not?" "Because I love Aunt Dora, and she's too good to look on me; and 'because if I should mention it to your father he would think me an old fool and out of my senses." Eva was not surprised at this abrupt com- munication of Ephraim Lanky ia regard to his love for Aunt Dora. She had long ob- served with a woman's eyes, the actions and looks of Ephraim when he was with Aunt Dora, and she knew that he loved her. "Will you take my advice, Ephraim?" she asked, with a smile of encouragement on her lips. "Now and forever," answerd Ephraim en- ergetically. "Go then and tell Aunt Dora that you love her, ask her to be your wife, and I will speak to father, and believe me that you shall still remain librarian and have a wife, too; we'll arrange it all; you know I'm a first rate manager." Ephraim Lanky sprang from his chair like a crazy man, flung his arms around Eva's neck, kissed her on both of her cheeks, then hI;.;lily letting her go from his embrace, he said: "Excuse my boldness dear child-you see I couldn't help it-I'm crazy-God bless you my angel-I go this moment," and he rushed to the door. But Ephraim did not go out; hesuddenly wheeled about and coming back to Eva, laid his hand on her shoulder and said: "Eva I've something to say to you about   love. Have you told your'father yet about yourself and Frank Noble?" "No, Ephraim, and I acknowledge I've done wrong; but I have felt a little bashful about it, you know, Ephraim, and have only delayed it a little while, everything here is so new to me." "Will you take my advice, Eva?" "Yes." "Well then, tell him at once, and I'll speak to him about it-we'll arrange it to- gether," said Ephraim, repeating Eva's words to her, and winking his great white eye. And then Ephra;m left the room, leaving Eva standing and looking after him with a face suffused with blushes. And as thus she stood, her father entered. "Eva, my child," he said, " sit down; I have something particular to say to you t "The maiden obeyed, and her father tak- ing her hand tenderly in his, continued: "Eva, who do you suppose has been here making proposals for your hand?" "I cannot imagine," was the faltering answer. Eva supposed that it was of course Frank Noble, and therefore her answer trembled on her lips.  "Well, my daughter I will tell you. It was Holdfast Sharp asking you in marriage for his son." "The wretch! has he dared to do this?" answered Eva, her eyes flashing with indig- nation. "Calm yourself, my dear daughter, and listen to me : he has dared to do this; no later ago than yesterday he made the prop- osition to me; said that he had certainly given you some reason to think hardly of him, on account of his appearing against you as the lawyer of Capt. Joshua Bull, keeper of the Poor House, and John Bear- em, the broker; but that all this was in the way of his profession and ought not to he taken in account to prejudice his son with you: that his son w' . 6cry worthy young than and great friend of my son, Augustus; and that he. Holdfast Sharp, Esq., had al- ways thought a great deal of you; that he would settle on his son, if he married you,    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6833-00000046"/> a handsome fortune; that he, the father, T would feel highly honored by the connec- a tion, and that his son loved you devotedly, n and hoped that as you had seen his son, t that you would grant his suit when it should t be made to you. I listened to all this, 1 Eva, with feelings of indignation at the E cool impudence of the fellow, that I cannot i express, for I believe that he has had more v to do with your violent and brutal abduc-  tion and your sufferings at the ' Emigrant's I Home,' than we can yet prove. I have 1 been for some time aware of his son's inti-  macy with my son, and have more than  once spoken to my son in censure for it. and have reprimanded him for bringing Frederick Sharp into my house and intro- ducing him to you, although I saw that your good sense told you at once how to treat the son of your enemy. I own I was not prepared for this abrupt proposal of. the rascally old father, and was half inclined to kick him out of my house yesterday when he made it, but he assured me that his son would be here to-day in person to press his suit, and I thought on the whole I would let him come and receive his an- swer from your own lips-he is here now and awaits you in the parlor." "Enough, Father. I will go myself to him; it will be some revenge to humble his self-esteem and tell him exactly what I think of him." And Eva Delany walked calmly into the parlor where Frederick Sharp awaited her to declare his love. Frederick Sharp, as he reclined at half length on the sofa in the parlor, awaiting the coming of Eva, was a fine spec- imen of humanity known in the natural history of the human race under the genus of the man-monkey. The prevailing char- acteristic about his head and face was a profusion of blaek hair. This hair, on the head, was smoothed down with a painful slickness, and rolled under at the extremity in one long curl traversing the whole of the back of the neck, and giving the head somewhat the appearance of a reversed bowl with a turned under, rolling edge.-   The hair on the face swept down the cheeks and around the chin and throat in an im- mense semi-circle of bristles, cropped like the box-wood borders in a garden, while that portion of it which graced the upper lip, was twisted in the form of two Turkish scimitars, but not presenting the same for- midable appearance as those renowned weapons. The features which peered out from this forest of carefully cultivated hair, were in perfect keeping. The nose was of that classical pattern called the snub, the lips large and sensual, the eyes small, black and sinister, and the forehead low and receding. Frederick Sharp was twirling his mus- taches with one hand, and tapping his pa- tent leather boot with a small cane which he held in the other, when the door opened and Eva entered. Frederick Sharp did not spring up from the sofa when Eva entered-he was too highly bred to exhibit any such vulgar haste as that. On the contrary he rose leisurely and languidly, made a low bow, and said as he placed a chair for Eva. "Good morning, Miss Delany-how are you this fine morning-one of the finest I think we have had this season; but I need not ask how you are, you look charming. Will you not do me the honor to sit; I have something very particular, somethingwhich has long oppressed me, but which I must speak out." And Frederick Sharp shot out on Eva from his little black eyes a regular fire of glanceswhich he intended to be very f impressive. g  The fire, however, missed its mark. Eva - regarded him with a cold and surprised 1 look, and still maintaining her position, an- s swered: (' Thank you, sir; there is no occasion for a me to sit. I can hear very well standing e all the communicationswith which Mr. Fre- 1 derick Sharp may honor me." y  This was somewhat of a damper to the e aspirations of Frederick Sharp; but it was I a high game which he was playing for him- d self and his lather, and he did not lose his - courage.   "You are cruel this morning, Miss Dela- ny," he continued, and still keeping up the fire of tender glances from his little black eyes; "how can you be so cruel to one who adores you, one who would kiss in his devo- tion the ground you tread on. Yes, Miss Delany-or rather Eva, let me call you-I adore you, have done so from the first mo- ment I sawyou; and I come now to lay my- self and my fortune, and it isno mean one I assure you, at your feet. Will you be mine? will you be my wife? Here at your feet I ask it," and as gracefully and quickly as  the extreme tightness of his pantaloons would permit, Frederick Sharp knelt before Eva and attempted to take one of her hands. "Touch me not, sir, but rise and hear what I have to say," answered Eva, flinging  off his hand and looking down upon him with undisguised contempt. Frederick Sharp sprung to his feet much quicker than he had fallen on his knees, and- much more to the danger of his pantaloons, so commanding, keen and contemptuous, was the tone with which Eva addressed him. "Yes, hear me, sir," continued Eva; "hear me reject your suit at once and deci- dedly. I would scorn myself if I could be brought so low as to entertain even the smallest particle of respect for one who in this city bears the character you do, and one who, like you, has been sent here by his father for some evil design I feel con- vinced; for nothing your father designs or approves of, can be honorable or right. I despise you, sir; despise your father, for he has been the blight of my early years; and the day will come when his villany will be brought to the light. How you or he could dare to insult me with the proposition which you have just named, would be incompre- hensible, was there not a shamelessness, which defies all bounds, and which your fa- ther and you, his weak tool, possess in all completeness. This is my answer; tell it to your father, and now, sir, I would be alone." The tender glances of Sharp turned to   looks of fury at these words of Eva; he twisted his mustachoes convulsively, and was about to make an angry reply, when Mr. Delany entered the room, leaving the door open, and saying: "You have your answer, sir; we would be alone." Frederick Sharp retired preciptately. "My daughter," said Mr. Delany, when the door closed on the rejected suitor, "you have answered him rightly. I think even Holdfast Sharp will feel somewhat crest- ifallen when he hears his son's report. But enough of this-I have just seen the Princi- pal of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, who tells me that your deaf and dumb friend, the dwarf, is getting on famously since I sent him up there: the Principal tells me that the dwarf learns faster than any pupil he has ever had ; but he seems to long to get back to you, and I have obtained the Prin- pal's permission for him to come downhere to-morrow and pass a few days with us: so kiss me my darling before I go down town to attend to business." "Father, there is one thing I would say to you, and which I should have said before," almost whispered Eva, as the blushes man- tled on her cheek, and she gave her father the kiss he asked. "Father, I love Frank Noble, and before I knew you I promised to be his wife ; he is all that is honorable and good, and although his rank in life is not what mine is now, yet he is fit to be raised to any rank-he loved me when I was poor, in danger, and in adversity. I cannot forget him when I am in prosperity. Will you give your consent?" "Wait a day or two and I will give you my answer." There was nothing in the looks of Mr. Delany as he said these words that could cause Eva to despair ; on the contrary she read in them all that could bid her hope, and she felt very happy. "Mr. Frederick Sharp," muttered that young gentleman to himself, as he slunk from the door of Mr. Delany's mansion and took his way down town; " it strikes me that you have been what is elegantly called    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6833-00000047"/> 'flummuxed' in this business. Who would  have thought that little Poor House girl te was such a regular tearer-but it is aston- ishing what a difference money will make cc in people-well. no matter, I guess I'll take w a drive out on the Third Avenue. I do f wonder what that old father of mine will i say to-morrow when he comes to town, and I tell him about the walking ticket I got." c Before Frederick Sharp reached the livery p stable to which he now directed his steps, o he met his friend Augustus Delany., who fu slapped him on the shoulder and saluted a him with the exclamation:       t "Ah, Fred, how d'ye do, this morning? I have you popped the question yet as you t said you were going to do?  Yes! well t what did my new sister say?" "Mr Augustus Dilany," answered Fred- t crick Slharp, looking his questioner solemn- \ vl in the face, "Mr. Augustus Delany, your  new sister is mighty old in some things, and  that is all I have at present to say about c her; but in the meantime I'll trouble you  for the three hundred dollars I lent you." "Certainly, my good fellow, I'll pay it  to-morrow; but what's in the wind? been rejected by my sister I suppose-well I can't help that-I talked you up to her all I could; but such things will happen in the best of families you know-good bye, see you again soon." And Augustus Delany very composedly went one way, and Frederick Sharp very discomposedly went another. On the night of the same day, about 12 o'clock, Frederick Sharp having returned from a ride on the Third Avenue, entered one of the most celebrated saloons in Broad- way, and finding a number of his friends there, called for wine and a game supper. It was something unusual for him to be thus generous, and his friends could not help passing among themselves a few glances of surprise at the circumstance; but as they were to be the gainers by it, all expression of their thoughts was instantly suppressed, and young Sharp was greeted on all sides with exclamations of my "fine fellow," "Fred my dear boy," mingled occasionally   with t" why Fred you're a brick," and other terms of like classical classical elegance. The supper and the wine were soon forth- coming, and Frederick Sharp and his friends were soon seated in one of the luxuriously furnished boxes, busily engaged in consum- ing the good things before them. In the adjoining box, and where they could hear every word uttered by the Sharp party, were also seated, over some plain oyster stews, flanked by shining mugs of ale, four young men dressed in firemen's shirte and caps. These were Frank Noble and three other members of the Etna Hose Com- pany. They had been to a fire and were taking some refreshments previous to going home. "Fred," exclaimed one of the Sharp par- ty, " come tell us all about that Eva May business the papers have made such a fuss about; you ought to know all about it you're so intimate with Gus Delany, the son of her. new found father-come let us have the whole story." "Yes! yes! let's have it!" exclaimed all * the rest of the party with one voice, and at the same time there was a great jingling of glasses on the table. "1 Oh the story's nothing," answered Fred- erick in a careless tone, "and all that stuff about the beauty and innocence of the girl is moonshine, got up for effect, because the the father, who has found and acknowledged like a fool his bast--" Frederick Sharp did not finish the vile phrase which he was about to apply to Eva i Delahy. While the word was yet half ut- d tered on his lips, a red arm was thrust into the box, and a hand of iron grasped his s throat, pulling him headlong out into the middle of the saloon, and hurling him on s the floor, as if he had been an infant. The hand and arm which executed this )f summary vengence belonged to Frank Noble, who, the next moment, unbuckling the leathern belt which he wore around his , waist, began to rain down with it on Sharp a shower of blows, which the latter in vain at- , tempted to ward off. "Wretch I villain! puppy i" exclaimed   Frank, " you are not worthy of a manly blow  with the fist. I'll whip you as I would a hound." And thicker and faster fell the stripes on the quivering Sharp, now twining around his legs where the flesh, under the tight fit of the pantaloons, received the blows with the most exquisite snugness of effect, and now stinging across his face in a number of eccentric lines and circles, which bit their way into his cheeks and nose, and fairly caused the hair of his whiskers t, fly. "Gentlemen! gentlemen! I'll have no af- frays in my house. Where's the police?- Police! police!" screamed the landlord, darting out of the door on the very uncer- tain journey of endeavoring to find some of the city guardians of the night, whose aid he had invoked. "Knock the ruffian down," exclaimed Frederick's friends, coming up to the rescue. But the "ruffian," as the Sharp party called Frank Noble, was not knocked down, simply because six arms covered with red flannel were extended threatningly towards the Sharp party, and the Sharp party came to a sudden pause in their attempted rescue. "Gemminy! Bill!" yelled a newsboy to one of his companions, as darting into the crowd which had already begun to collect at the door, he peeped down into the sa- loon, "gemminy! how one of the Etna's boy's is a wollopping that swell of a fellow with the whiskers-go it Etna; give him jesse," and the next moment the speaker and his companion darted off. "Get up, you miserable hound," at length exclaimed Frank Noble, ceasing to flourish his belt, and very composedly buckling it again round his waist; "get up and tell your worthy father when next you see him what a thorough whipping you have had at my hands, and that it is not improbable but on some future occasion I will repeat the amusement, with the difference only of tak- ing his back instead of yours for the surface of my operations." The whole of the above scene occupied but a few moments; the friends of Noble had prevented those of Sharp from interfering;   the crowd at the door and the many persons who had been in the saloon when the flog- ging commenced, had looked on passively, seeming rather to enjoy the scene than otherwise ; no police officers had interfered, t and Frank Noble had administered the cas- tigation without molestation. Just as young Sharp, by the permission of his adversary, was rising to his feet, the proprietor of the saloon returned from his police hunt, bringing with him several in- dividuals with stars on their breasts. '"You are not wanted gentlemen," said Noble, addressing the men with the stars, "the affair is over, and all parties are satis- fied." "If such is the case, if all parties are sat- isfied and peace is restored, I don't think there is anything for us to do but to take a drink and walk out," said the leader of the stars, laughing and turning to his compan- ions. His companions gave a loving glance to- ward the glittering decanters on the bar and nodded an unanimous assent. There was some movement among young Sharp's friends as if they wished him to in- sist on the arrest of Noble; but Sharp had his own reasons for not going before the Police Court in the matter, and he there- fore, with a very crest-fallen look, intimated to his friends that he wished the affair for the present to drop where it was. "I'll have revenge some other time," he muttered. "Any time you please," said Frank Noble with a smile of scorn. The Police officers took a drink and left the saloon, followed soon after by Frank Noble and his three friends; and thus ended the flogging of Frederick Sharp. "What shall I do now, father?" said young Sharp. the next day, after having told his father of his rejection by Eva and his whipping by Frank Noble. "Do nothing," was the answer of the father, "I'll attend now to the matter my- self." "What do you propose doing now?" said    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6833-00000048"/> Runyon Dooal to Holdfast Sharp after the tatter had in his turn related the particulars of the rejection and the flogging.   "I propose to get that will back from Jack of the Cross, and silenceing him-that is now our only hope."   CHAPTER XVII.   POISON AND THE DAGGER. "This dirty scrawl comes in good time; read it and see what you think of it." These words were addressed by Holdfast Sharp to Runyon Dooal, two days after the affair between young Sharp and Frank Noble. The lawyer and Dooal were at the time alone in the private office at Green- burgh. Dooal took the dirty scrap of paper which Holdfast Sharp handed him, and having read it, said: "Ha! a letter from our old friend, Jack of the Cross! saying, in a blind way, which no one but ourselves can understand, that if you or I, (only one of us,) will meet him on Wednesday next at Higgins' Porter House, No. - Rosevelt street, at 11 o'clock, or any other place in New York you may appoint, and give him $2000, he will give up the will and clear out. Well, I suppose we will have to do it." "Yes, but I suppose we will have to do something else-Dooal, you and I are in a scrape-we can never be safe as long as this Jack of the Cross is alive. We can- not murder him by the knife, but we must r kill him. I have been thinking it all over -we must kill him. I have managed to obtain, no matter how, a subtle poison which will cause death as if by a fit-now I will appoint the place of meeting at a porter house kept by a friend of mine in Walker street. You or I will meet him there, give him the poison in a glass of brandy-he will fall down dead, and then you have only to call up the landlord and say he fell in a fit-the landlord knowing me and you will not suspect any thing-a   coroner's jury will be summoned, and the dead man being nobody, a verdict of" died by the visitation of God" will be given, and our enemy will be out of the way." "All this is very well conceived," an- swered Dooal, "but which of us is to be the murderer-yes, murderer! that's the word -I don't at all feel like it." "Dooal, there is but one fair way to set- tle the question you ask, and that is for us to draw lots which of us- shall undertake the job." "Yes, that is fair; I can make no objec- tion." And the two plotters and murder- ers, by means of two strips of paper, one short and one long, proceeded to decide the awful question. The one who drew the shortest piece was to be the man. Dooal held the slips, and when Sharp had pulled out the slip which he chose, the SHORTEST remained in Dooal's hand. "Dooal," said Sharp, composedly taking out of his pocket a small folded paper, "here is the poison, the rest remains with you, and remember you are in the same boat with me." Dooal's hands trembled as he took the paper and put it into his pocket. And the. partners in guilt then se erated. On the night appointed for the meeting of Dooal and Jack of the Cross, Frank No- ble, accompanied by the dwarf, was cross- ing from the Bowery to Broadway by the way of Walker street. The dwarf had been to the house of Frank's mother on a visit, and Frank was now taking him home to the mansion of Mr. Delany. It was about eleven o'clock, and asFrank    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6833-00000049"/> and the dwarf approached near the corner o)f Walker and Centre streets, the dwarf -uddenly pulled Frank by the arn, at the -ame time pointing to a man who was ,ntering a porter house which they were iust passing. Frank looked at the man, but not know- ing him, turned in amazement towards the ,',warf, who was trembling with excitement. The dwarf met Frank's look of wonder by pointing in the direction of the Emi- grant's Home, and then drawing his hand across his throat, as if he was in the act of cutting it. It flashed at once across Franlks mind that the Dwarf meant to say that the man who had just entered the porter house had something to do with the affair of Eva May, and he determined at once to enter the house. His suspicions were confirmed on entering and seeing Runyon Dooal just leaving the bar-room with the man to whom the Dwarf had called his attention. The two worthies were evidently retiring for consultation to a private room. Frank called for some ale, and motion- ing to the Dwarf to follow his example, hid his head behind a newspaper which he took from the table, determining to wait and see what further would come to pass. But we must follow Dooal and Jack of the Cross to the private room. "Well, here I am, according to appoint- ment," said Jack of the Cross, taking his seat at a table, on whir ,t'e -' had already been placed a bott' " ' hrnd, and two glasses. "Here I ais ,- .uo ady with the 'rocks' or the tirL' ,: ot' landsmen say?" "All ready, Jack; but come, let us first take a drink; this is first rate brandy, for I ordered the best the landlord could get." As Dooal spoke he poured out some brandy in both of the glasses. Then, sud- denly looking around, he said- "Hark, did you not hear a noise; just see, Jack, if that door is fast; we must be careful." There was a peculiar expression on Jack's face as he went to the door-he suspected   that Dooal was about to execute some trick on him, and although he pretended to try the knob of the door, he kept a backward glance on his companion. It was well that he did, for that backward glance of his showed to him Dooal in the act of dropping a white powder into his (Jack's) glass. Jack of the Cross, however, returned to the table without evincing by his actions that he had seen anything out of the way in Dooal, and again taking his seat, said carelessly that he did not care to drink, and would rather at once proceed to busi- ness. "Well," said Dooal, and his look was rather blank as he spoke, "I have the mo- ney, give me the Will." "Not so fast, not so fast, Mr. Dooal, for reasons best known to myself I have left the Will at a certain place in Rosevelt street, and you must follow me there to get it." Jack of the Cross had the Will in his pocket, but this attempt of Dooal's to poison altered his former design of giving it up. "I don't know about going with you," said Dooal, hesitatingly, " that was not the agreement, the appointment was here." "Yes ." returned Jack, "I know it was but I've changed my mind; you needn't be, afraid of going with me, there's honor among thieves, you know, and besides, it's the only way you'll get the Will." "Well, I'll go." And the two left the room, passed through the bar-room without observing Noble or the Dwarf, and issued into the street. But Frank Noble and the Dwarf were on the heels of Dooal and Jack of the Cross. Silently, in the darkness of night, Jack of the Cross and Dooal walked on towards Roosevelt street, followed cautiously by Frank Noble and the Dwarf. At the entrance of the same dark alley into which Ephraim Lanky and Eva May had been formerly drawn, Jack of the Cross stopped, and said: "You must go in here with me, but you needn't be afraid, Jack of the Cross is an honest man, come," and with a sudden shove   he thrust Dooal into the alley, and followed. The next moment, Noble heard these words in a hissing whisper: "You thought to poison me, did you? well take that for your pains, and die with the comfort of knowing that I have got your money and will keep the Will." Then fol- lowed a fall and a groan, and all was still. The whole of the above scene was but the work of an instant, and before Frank Noble could decide whether to trust himself into the darkness of the alley, Jack of the Cross appeared again at the entrance. His figure had hardly emerged from the darkness, be- fore Frank Noble was upon him. The struggle was a fearful one, so well matched in strength were Frank Noble and   the murderer, but the Dwarf decided-it by dealing Jack of the Cross a blow with a heavy stick which he picked up from the pavement. By this time, the cries of the Dwarf and the loud call of Frank for the police, during all the time he had been strugglingswith Jack of the Cross. had the effect of bringing some members of that body to the spot. Frank briefly explained the state of affairs; a cart having been procured, the body of Dooal was dragged frcm the alley and placed upon it, while Jack of the Cross, who had only been staggered by the blow of the Dwarf, was securely bound. The whole party then proceeded to the City Prison.    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6833-00000050"/> CIAPTER XVIII.   RETRBUTION BY THE TEMPEST AND RETRI-  BUTION BY THE SCAFFOLD. "Three stabs of a dagger in the region t of the heart, any one of which would have  killed him! with what savage ferocity this  fearful man, Jack of the Cross, must have struck his victim?-and thus at last Runyon Dooal has died the death of a dog," said Ephraim Lanky, looking first at Eva' and then at Frank Noble and Mr. Delany, and a shudder passing through his whole frame as he spoke. "Yes,' answered Eva, " and died by the hand of one of his accomplices-but this awful death has unravelled the mystery of the sufferings to which I have been subject- ed-it is as clear as noonday, the discovery of my grandfather's will shows plainly that Holdfast Sharp and Blear-Eyed Jake, the landlord of the 'Emigrants Home' are the authors of all my misery, in order that they might obtain my inheritance. I shudder to think what would have been my fate if by the deaf and dumb dwarf, and by you, Frank, I had not been rescued on that awful night" and Eva covered her face with her hands. "The retributive hand of heaven," said Mr. Delany, " seems certainly, at last, to have interposed in this vile plot of Hold- fast Sharp and his agents, and although I shrink, Eva from having you exposed in Court as a witness, to the insults of lawyers and to the gaze of impudent curiosity, jus- tice in this case is paramount to all private considerations-Holdfast Sharp is in my opinion a villain of a more dangerous char- acter than Jack of the Cross and equally deserves the punishment of the gallows:   but unfortunately the law will only send him to prison for the crime which he has com- mitted against you, for we cannot prove that he intended to instigate Blear-Eyed Jake and Jack of the Cross to murder you- his object seems to have only been to get you out of the way. However, my dear daughter, you must appear as witness when the trial of Sharp comes on, and we must do all we can in order to have him punished to the full extent of the law." "Never fear for me, father," answered Eva, "I will overcome all the repulsivene^- I feel at the idea of appearing in Court. if by going,Holdfast Sharp shall be held up as a warning to all lawyers who thus degrade their profhssion and make it a business to destroy the poor and unprotected." The above conversation took place in the parlor oft]r. Delany's on the next evening after the night of the murder of Dooal and the arrest of Jack of the Cross. A coroner's inquest had been held during the day on the body of Dooal, and the evidence of Frank Noble being conclusive as to the mur- der, Jack of the Cross had been committed for trial. The discovery of the will of John Morton on the person of Jack of the Cross, and the identification of the latter by Eva, as one of the persons who visited her in the stone dungeon of the' Emigrant's Home' on the night of the fire, together with the words used by Jack of the Cross when he plunged the dagger into Dooal's heart. were enough to point out Holdfast Sharp as the instigator of the abduction of Eva, and with the committal of Jack of the Cross a war- rant was also issued for the arrest of Hold- :,.fast Sharp.   Such was the state of affairs with refer- ence to Sharp and Jack of the Cross, when the above conversation between Eva, the schoolmaster and Mr. Delany took place in the parlor of the latter. We must, how- ever, invite the attention of the reader to another scene which occurred on the same evening in a different and distant part of the city. At the period of which we write, there stood at the lower end of Water street and in the neighborhood of the Battery, an old dilapidated building, built after the Dutch fashion, with the gable end to the street.- In the days of its glory it was doubtless a building of some note and might have been the residence of a wealthy burgomaster; but its greatness had departed, and a dirty red curtain across the window, and various labels hanging around the door and in the window, inscribed "Tom and Jerry," "Whiskey Punch," and with other capti- vating titles of drinks, told the story that the old Dutch building, whatever might have been its former glories, was now nothing but a sailor porter house. In an upper room of this porter house a single person was seated on the night in question. He was a man apparently not more than fifty years of age, dressed in an overcoat of heavy dark colored cloth, the collar of which rose up very high on either side of his face, and together with an im- mense pair of jet-black whiskers wholly concealed his features. His hair also was ,lick and long, falling down on his shoul- ders from beneath a coarse cap which was l ailled over his eyes. His pantaloons were as coarse as his cap, and thick boots were on his feet. On the table beside him was a candle, a bottle of brandy and a glass.- Into the glass he had just poured about a ;'ill of the brandy. "Humph!" he said, swallowin the liquor, but twisting his mouth immediately after- wards as if the draught had been far from pleasant, "Humph! my friend, Mr. Land- lord, you keep villainous brandy, at any rate-it burns a man's throat like fire-well, a little fire is just what I want at present,   it is seldom I drink brandy, but when I do I want it strong-I want it strong now!" and the man with the cap poured out an- other dram, and swallowed it. Then the man with the cap rose from his chair, and advanced to a cracked looking- glass which .lung on the side of the wall, Taking off his cap he surveyed himself for a moment, chuckling quietly to himself as he did so: "Well done! Holdfast Sharp, Esq.!" he at length exclaimed in a low tone to him- self, "Well done, the d-1 himself would'nt know you if he should happen to meet you, ha! ha! ha!-beautiful black hair and such a magnificent pair of whiskers! well, I hardly know' myself-now Mr. Eustace Delany, and Mr. Frank Noble and Miss Eva May, you think perhaps you have got me and that that warrant issued to-day for my my arrest, will bring me into the hands of justice to-morrow; you are slightly mista- ken, Holdfast Sharp is not to be caught that way-gold and Bank of England notes in plenty are in a belt safe and tight around my waist, and here am I ready to step into the ship in the stream, and leave justice to whistle for Holdfast Sharp-justice! bah  justice is all gammon to a smart, keen man,' and the disguised Holdsast Sharp again put on his cap, pulled up the collar of his coat closer around his face, and then gave three knocks on the table. The summons was answered by the land- lord of the old Dutch porter house, a burly individual with a red broad face and purple nose. "Is the boat ready and the coast clear'" asked Sharp. "Aye, aye! no danger, all ready and safe," was the answer. "Then forward is the word-when we arrive at the ship, your money will be ready," said Sharp, and immediately after- wards he and the landlord left the house together. The night was dark, and silently in the darkness, the little boat which contained the landlord and Holdfast Sharp, made its way towards a small brig which lay out in    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6833-00000051"/> the stream. The landlord rowed. and Sharp, v with his arms folded on his breast, sat, with- li out speaking a word, until the boat reached i the brig. Then, taking out a purse, he tl said:                 n "Here is your money, true to a penny, n good night."              P The next moment he had ascended the 1 side of the brig and was lost to sight, while c the landlord, with a grunt of satisfaction, n gave the purse a toss into his pocket, and v then rowed back to the shore.     h With the first light of the morning, the h brig "Dolphin," on board of which Hold- fast Sharp had thus secretly taken his pas- c sage, spread her sails to the wind and left t the bay of New York. The breeze during c the day blew very light, and when night I fell upon the waters the Dolphin was still 1 on the coast. And with the night came the E storm and tempest in fearful fury, lashing  the sea iuto raging and seething billows, in  the black t-oughs and on the white caps of which, the Dolphin was tossed and whirled like a whisp of straw. Every soul on board E of the doomed vessel quailed with terror,  and even the courage of the captain, an old sailor who for years had been familiar with the ocean, failed him, although still in the pauses of the storm his voice was heard through his trumpet, cheering and ordering his men as firmly as usual. But there was one on whom fear fell with a power awful to behold, and that was Holdfast Sharp, who crouching in his berth. his eyes starting from their sockets, and his whole frame trembling like an aspen leaf, seemed to await in speechless horror the issue of the storm. Notwithstanding, however, all the terror which nad taken possession of him, his hand was convulsively pressed upon his waist in the region of his money-belt, as if, even when death in one of its most frightful forms was staring him in the face, his soul still clung to the gold for which he had sold it during all h s life. As peal after peal of thunder crashed through the black vault of the heavens, as cracking andgroaning in every joint, the "Dolphin" rose to the hissing crest of the   waves, quivered a moment there in the lightning's flash, and then madly plunged into the dark depths below, and as amid the roar of the thunder and the ocean, the mingled prayer, and curse and cry for mercy, arose from the terrified crew and passengers, Holdfast Sharp, with face and lips livid as those of a dead man, still- clung convulsively with his hands to his money-belt, and utterd no sound, while the violence of the surges of the ship, tossed him like a ball from one end to the other of his narrow berth. Anl during all the night, the tempest continued in its fury, and nearer and nearer to the rocky coast, the "Dolphin" was dashed by the merciless wind and waves. With the first faint gleam of the morning's light, there was a fearful crash followed by a long wailing cry, which rose above the voices of the storm, and then the "Dolphin" lay a shattered wreck on the coast. Some of the crew and passengers of the unfortunate brig were saved, but a majority were either swallowed up by the waves, or dashed lifeless on the rocky shore ; it is for us, however, to follow particularly the fate only of Holdfast Sharp. At the moment when the ship struck, Sharp with the rest who were in the cabins, rushed upon the deck, but he had no sooner touched it than a wave which broke in fury across it, swept him into the sea. But the wave did not sweep Sharp into the jaws of death, it threw him on a narrow strip of beach from which the shore rose in abrupt and steep ledges of rock. For a moment he was senseless, then slowly recovering, , he grasped instinctively his money belt, scrambled with difficulty to his feet and looked around him. Although the roaring s sea was on one side, and a wall of rock on the other as far as his eye could reach, 1 Holdfast Sharp derived courage from hope, I and prepared to save himself. Looking as closely into the character of the rocks as I the faint light of the morning would allow s him, it appeared to him that they rose above "him in successive terraces growing smaller as they approached the summit; and he   therefore determined to endeavor to, scale them. But how was he to surmount the first? Its top was considerable higher than he could reach, and the indentations on its tace were not deep enough for him to gain and keep any good hold with his hands and feet alone. Long and earnesly Sharp look- ed at the rock, and then as if a new idea seemed to strike him, he unbuckled his money belt. After taking the belt from his waist, he buckled it again, and holding it in his hand he looked once more at the rock. There was a narrow projection at the top of the rock, and this fact had inspired Sharp with the idea of the attempt which he was about to make. "Now," said he te himself, "if I have strength enough to throw this belt over that projection, I can raise myself up to the top and I shall be saved, for the rest is easy." Exhausted as he was, and shivering with the cold, (for the waves had washed his false wig from his head, leaving his shaven crown bare to the wind and spray,) he made one desperate effort and succeeded in throw- ing the belt over the projection, still retain- ing the lower portion of it in his hand. And now commenced the struggle to reach the top, by planting his feet in the crevices of the rock, and endeavoring to pull himself up by the belt. Nearer and nearer, his hands tugging dlesperately at the suspended belt, his bare feet seeking convulsively to dig into the -imall cracks, or to clutch the little protu- ierances on the face of the rock, at one ilrment slipping and swinging in the air, a.:d at the next regaining his hold, and ma- king a slight' advance, his breast heaving ;i,1 panting with exertion, and his eyes bloodshot and starting with mingled af- fright and eager agonising hope-thus alruggling in his last effort for life, Hold- 'ast Sharp approached nearer and nearer to the summit of the rock until at length it required but one spring to throw himself ,upon the top and be safe. Tblt spring he now preplared to make, and with a strain of all his mtuscles in which he concentrated   the whole of his remnnngn strongth. le raised his head even with the top ,i' the rock, intending tr throw his arm over the projection where the belt watq susp'nllr I, and then to give himself a fling, feet 1f,re- most, over on what he supposed to be the flat surface of the summit. But at that moment, another head, and one fearful to look at, peered over II(he rock, and met the startled gaze of SIuii p. It was the head of a man who was e'lloue'b- ing upon the top of the rock, and '.iom this head, covered with red bristling h-ir as with a mane, and looking more like tl!e head of a ferocious beast than that of a man, two black eyes,'like balls of fire, glar- ed down on Sharp, while high in the air a p- peared a long black and gigantic arm hold- ing a knotted bludgeon, as if just aboat to strike. No word or sound came from the shanry head where the fiery eyes were gle'lnli,:' and above which the bludgeon was po),.d i by the gigantic arm ; and before the terror- stricken Sharp could utter a cry for nimrcy, - the bludgeon descelnded on his bare ad uin- - protected skull, crushing it in witlh a lull and grating sound, and spattering the ) brains even into the face of the savage  Wrecker of the Coast, who had dealt thl  ) awful blow., With a whirl the body ol' Sharp splashed into the foaming waves be-  low, but was again cast back on the beach, e as if even the waves disdained to hold in e their embrace the carcase of one who had - been so vile a man. e  The Wrecker, with a fiendish smile, watlni- ed the whirl of Sharp's body into the wa-t! r - and its casting back again on the shore by the waves. Then he disengaged the money s belt from the projection of' the rock, and al. r- he poured some of its glittering contents in s his hand, he muttered to himself: "- Lie quiet below there, my old boy, it's o a good place to sleep in, although rather' t wet and airy, and perhaps somebody may f possibly find and recognise you, and. e then it will be a grand thing to put into )f the newspapers, among the 'incid(ents' us d they call them, of the shipwreck, saying as    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6833-00000052"/> how you come to your death by being dash- ed by the raging waves; on to the rocks, and having your skull smashed, ha! ha! ha! it will be so grand, because you see it's so horrible, and the newspaper readers love to read about horrible things, ha! ha!" and thus chuckling and philosophising in his savage manner, over his morning's work, the Wrecker put the money belt in the ca- pacious pocket of his overcoat, and scramb- ling over the rocks, was soon lost to* the sight. Thus perished Holdfast Sharp, whose motto was to get money. no matter by what means, and to hold fast to that money when once obtained. He did hold fast to it until theelast moment, when, flying from the punishment of the law, the tempest gave him into the hands of a more awful retribution-a retribution more awful even than that of the scaffold which was after- wards visited upon one of his accomplices, and to which we now change the scene. Among the incidents of the shipwreck of the brig Dolphin, contained in the newspa- pers a few days after the occurrence of that terrible calamity, there was one, as the Wrecker of the Coast had predicted, giving an account of the finding on the sea shore, of the bruised and mangled body of ax old man, which from certain papers found in the pocket of the clothes, was sup- posed to be that of Holdfast Sharp, Esq., against whom there had been a warrant issued in the Eva May affair. The writer very naturally attributed the death of Sharp to drowning, and the wounds on the head and body to the sharp points of the rocks. "Thus, my daughter," said Mr. Delany, on reading this intelligence, "has your principal enemy met a just punishment, and only one more evil spirit, Jack of the Cross, who plotted against you, remains to receive the reward of his deeds. He will. I under- stand, be tried in a few days, and as the evidence is conclusive against him, he can- not escape the gallows. Then, dear Eva, forgetting all the unpleasant circumstances of the past, I trust that there will be naught   but happiness for you in the future.'- Eva could, for answer, only throw her arms around her father's neck, and weep. It is needless for us to dwell upon the trial of Jack of the Cross for the murder of Runyon Dooal. Frank Noble's testimony was distinct and admitted of no doubt, and the motives which urged the murderers to the deed, were made plainly apparent by the Will of John Moreton, and the testi- mony of Eva May, which unravelled the whole plot and connection with each other, of Sharp, Dooal, Blear-Eyed Jake and Jack of the Cross. The Jury found Jack " guilty of murder in the first degree," without leav- ing their seats. The trial of course created great excitement, and the court-room was crowded during its continuance. Among the incidents which occurred, there was one which created some mirth and disturbed in no slight degree the equanimity of the Bench. When Jack of the Cross was first placed at the bar, and when he was about to answer to'the usual question of the clerk on such occasions, ' Guilty, or not guilty?" a voice, deep and sonorous, arose from among the crowd of spectators. "Guilty you sneaking dog, and no mis- take, for I'm darned if you aint the same ugly faced fellow that robbed me and tied me in the woods." The voice which uttered this inopportune remark, belonged to our old friend, Capt. Josh Bull, ex-keeper of the Poor-House, and who had come all the way from Green- burgh to hear the trial of the murderer of his friend, Runyon Dooal. On seeing and recognizing in Jack the man who had rob- bed him of one hundred dollars, and left him tied and bound in the woods, he could not restrain his anger, but gave it vent without regard to time or place, and with no very nice choice of language. "Who is that man who thus disturbs the decorum of this Court? officer, take him into custody," said the Judge, in a stern voice, amid a roar of laughter from the whole courtroom, which it required several heavy raps of the judicial hammer to quoil. "Yer Honor," said Capt. Josh Bull,   trembling in the grasp of the officer, who a pulled him forward before the Judge. "Yer t] Honor, I humbly beg your pardon; I didn't mean no offence: you see my feelings got  the better of me, when I looked at that t prisoner, for he robbed me, that's a fact, I and so you see I spoke right out, without'  thinking. I hope yer Honor will forgive a me."                  t Although the voice and frown of the E Judge was very stern, there was a slight twitching around the corners of his mouth, c as if he also wished to laugh, as he said: ' "Stand back, sir, you are excused this E time, but beware in the future."  Jack of the Cross was sentenced to death  and the day appointed for his execution at  length arrived. Jack of the Cross was hung in the yard of the City Prison, and his execution, like all others which take place in New York, was said to be private. Nevertheless, some three orfour hundred persons were present in the yard around the gallows,and among them Capt. Josh Bull, who determined to see the last of his enemy. The manner in which so many obtained admittance to the spectacle of the execution, was by procuring their appointment as "Deputy Sheriffs," in order to assist in the ceremonies-a slight twist- ing of the law, in order to enable morbid curiosity to gratify itself with the death agonies of a fellow being; And while a dense crowd of men, women and children, around the outer walls of the Prison, heaved and surged with excitement, pressing against and jostling each other uttering obscene jests mingled with curses and laughter, the crowd of "Deputy Sher- iffs" within the walls also pressed and surged against each other and the gallows, many of them laughing and talking gaily,   and all of them waiting with impatience for the coming of the condemned. He came, dressed in a white frock bound with black, with a cap upon his head and the rope around his neck. A priest of the Roman Church, holding a crucifix in his hand, walked beside him; the Sheriff, with a cocked hat and sword, preceded him, and the Jury appointed to witness his execution, and other officials followed in the rear. With a firm step, Jack of the Cross as- cended the platform of the gallows, and amid the death-like stillness which reigned among the assembled crowd, the Sheriff read the warrant for the execution, and then turning to Jack of the Cross, asked him if he had anything to say. "' Nothing," was the answer, in a firm and unsubdued tone. Then the priest offered almost in a whis- per a short prayer, elevated the cross to the lips of the Condemned, who devoutly kissed the sacred emblem; then the sheriff and the priest shook hands with the Con- demned, the cap was drawn and the rope adjusted, and the next moment there was heard the dull sound of the axe cutting the rope, and then Jack of the Cross swung be- tween earth and Heaven, a hideous specta- cle for men to behold. Twice were the strong muscles of the wretched man convulsed as with terrible agony, and then the limbs straitened out motionless and stiff, and Jack of the Cross was dead. Then the crowd within the prison drew again their breath, and poured forth from 3 the gates to mingle with the crowd without, - and tell the story of the spectacle of the d laot penalty of the law, which now was ,over. 1    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6833-00000053"/> CHAPTER XIX.   MATRIMONY AND THE END. Our scene changes to the residence of Frank Noble. It is a day after the execu- tion of Jack of the Cross, and Ephraim Lanky and Aunt Dora are alone in the common sitting-room or rather parlor of the house. Ephraim Lanky has not yet followed the advice of Eva Delany, and told Aunt Dora how he loves and reverences her. The murder of Dooal and the exciting events which have followed, together with a cer- tain diffidence which has led him to post- pone the declaration, have prevented him from speaking out the wishes of his heart. But he has made up his mind to speak now. "Miss Noble," said Ephraim, "H-" "Aunt Dora, if you please, Ephraim, that is my name," said Aunt Dora, inter- ruptin- the schoolmaster in her mild tone of voice, in which there was now the slight- est possible accent of good-humored arch- ness. "Well, Aunt Dora then, my dear Aunt Dora," continued Ephraim, growing some degrees bolder as he proceeded. "My dear Aunt Dora-now don't laugh-but-old as I am I have fallen in love," and here Ephraim came to a dead halt. "Why, Ephraim, how you astonish me! and whom do you love, Ephraim?" answer- ed Aunt Dora trying to keep up a light tone of raillery, but there was a glistening mois- ture in her eye, and her voice was tremu- lous as she spoke. "I love you, Aunt Dora," was the school- master's answer. "And I return the feeling," was Aunt Dora's calm, but unpoetie answer.   "Will you marry me? I will be your protector here, and your willing helper in the care of your mother-for Frank, Aunt Dora, I take it, is about getting a house for himself. Some people may say to be sure that we are rather an old couple; but that is nothing, Aunt Dora, when our hearts speak to each other in love. Age may blight the body with its frost, but it has no power over the love' founded on es- teem'. "I will be your wife, Ephraim, and walk gladly with you the down hill of life which is before us both." And thus Ephraim Lanly and Dora Noble were betrothed. Smile not, reader, it was a betrothal in the winter of life, when passion was in a great measure frozen over with the ice of years, but the crystal wells of the sentiment of love beneath were none the less clear and pure. About the same time that this scene be- tween Aunt Dora and Ephraim took place in the house in East Broadway, anotherwas in progress in the mansion of Mr. Delany, to which we now transport the reader. Eva, and Frank Noble were alone in the bay-window of the mansion. "Frank! I have just finished reading the account of the execution of that terrible man-it is awful, is it not?" said Eva. "Yes," answered Frank Noble; " but dis- miss it from your mind-but have you read the paragraph just below it in the paper?" "' No." "Then look at it," and Frank taking the paper from Eva pointed out to her the par- agraph to whioh he referred, and which was as follows:   "We understand that John Bearem, Esq.,' one of our most wealthy, respectable, and celebrated bankers of Wall street, sails this day for Europe. Pleasure, and the negoti- ating some very heavy loans in Europe, are the causes which lead him abroad. We wish him a pleasant tour and success to his enter- prise." Eva handed the paper back to Frank with a smile, but made no remark. The subject of Jack of the Cross, Holdfast Sharp and John Bearem was never more mentioned be- tween them. "And now my dear Eva," said Frank, after both had been silent for some mo- ments, " has your father given his consent to our marriage? You have put me off long Eva, am I not now entitled to my re- ward?" "There comes father and he will answer you himself, dear Frank," and Eva turned aside to hide her blushes as Mr. Delany en- tered the room. "This is your reward, Frank Noble," said Mr. Delany, and he laid the hand of Frank in that of Eva. "( Take her," he continued, " love her and cherish her as your wife, in wealth and pros- perity, as you have loved and protected her as the foundling girl, in poverty and adversity." And thus Eva's father sanctioned her be- betrothal with Frank Noble. At this moment the door again opened, and Ephraim Lanky and Aunt Dora Noble entered.   i Ur" TiHi ruuxt-nuo.      ,, "There is more work dear father of the same kind for you to perform; here is another couple for you .o sanction with your approbation by malhilg t ;(m happy in their love," said Eva, looking up from Frank's shoulder, on which she leaned, and smiling through her tears. "There Ephraim, you need not speak; Eva has told me all, and I have made such provisions for you that you and Aunt Dora your wife may live the rest of your days in independence; and, therefore, the sooner these two weddings take place the better," And Mr. Delany placed a paper, which looked very much like a deed, in Ephraim's hands as he spoke. Two joyous weddings, not many dlays after the above scenes, took place. Ephraim and Aunt Dora were married first, the mar- riage of Eva and Frank followed, and Mr. Delany gave a splendid entertainment in honor of both events. Time rolled on; Aunt Dora and Ephraim lived many years in a home of their own, and died peacefully within a day of each other. Frank Noble, the fireman, rose higher and higher in the estimation of his fellow citizens, and was finally elected to a seat in Congress; while blessed with health, riches, and children who made glid the hearts of their parents, happiness tI most perfect and unalloyed attended all mar- ried life of EVA, THE FOUNDLING  THE POOR HOUSE.

We have not the space, though we have a strong inclination, to give our readers a taste of its quality-to re- print at length the matchless sceele of the lover's meeting the fortune-teller in the gloom of the forest; the appalling interview :tnd the grave-stories in the church- yard at midnight; the droll dialogu'es of the regiment:l mess-table; the eloquent description of the encampment of the rival armies; the fearful carnage of the  battle-field; the prodigies of valor performed during the mountain combat; the, richly-humorous " confessiols of a gentleman who would have married if he  could ;" and a dozen other delineations marked in every page by some bold trait of wit or genius. The war-liko descriptions will vie with the most animated scenes in Allison or Napier; and the hlmorous portions of the book have no peers but in the pages of Lover or Lover.--Morning Star. THE BIVOUAC, OR RIVAL SUITORS, by Col. W. H. Maxwell, is one of those popular romances which are eagerly devoured by. readers of fiction, and. in this instance, without the deleterious influence which is too frequently attributed to much of the literature of the day. The "Bivouac"s is a spirited, well-conceived and thrilling picture in the O'Malley style. The memoir of a ruined beauty, which occurs in the course of the story, is a touching exhibition of the extreme anguish which flattery and lflsehood may inflict.

Two innocent and -lovely puritan maidens be-  eotme the victims of the accursed arts of Rochester and Clayton; and the strong  contrasts presented bytheir holy love to the heartless lust of their seducers, form t  some of the most affedive chapters ever written.

EUGENE SUE'S GREAT PROSCRIBED BOOK, THE MY TERIE8 OF THE PEOPLE. I I Is the course of this great Romance, SUE, (while he adds much to the interest of the plot,) exposes the causes which drive so 'many THOUSANDS OF THE MEN OF PARIS TO GAMBLING, ROBBERY, AND THE GALLEY, AND THE WOMEN TO PROS- TITUTION AND THE MORGUE., While it is entirely free from any offensive thoughts or language, it unveils the terrible, social evils that are  GANGRENING THE VERY HEART OF TIEt       FRIENCH SOCIETY.  Never has genius conceived or described more interesting characters than those which imP part to this story the animation of real life. The bold, handsome, but cruel and licentioua Cclonel de Plournel--fie stern, frigid, jeuitical Cardinal- -the lovely and virtuous daugh- tter of the honest Linen Draper-the intrepid and worthy young Joiner-and the beau-, tiful 4ut guilty Griscte, who receives in her white breast the ball aimed at her heroic lover on the barricade--are all faithful types of the various classes in, the metropolis of;: i France;  So admirably written and full of interest, indeed, is this incomparable book, that all the. vigilance of the French spies' ard poliee has been unable to prevent the circulation of mil-, ! lions of copies in every department of France.

THS novel is one of those rare conceptions which every now and then make their appearance to amaze and convulse the world. It abounds in all those stir- ring incidents, and bold vigor9us passages, which have so long been the distinguish- ing features of Mr. Judson's writings. Although not written in the shape, it re- X quires but a'glance at its pages to satisfy any intelligent mind that it is nothing more nor less than an Autobiography of its illustrious author, and a record of one of the most remarkable conspiracies for the overthrow and destruction of its hero,  that ever disgraced ,a people. .It is a revelation of. the wrongs and suerings whil ch  every pure-hearted patriot and reformer must expec t i .diecounter jil is efpr$pr;'S , ameliorate the condition of the struggling masses, and lead them oh to'4 'ioblei; destiny than that in which he finds them. And, taking a single leaf from his own extraordinarily adventurous history, Mr. Judson presents in THE CONVICT a' picture, bold in its outlines, anid graphically stirring il its narrative and details of. persecution and suffering, which stands without a rival even in this age of mas- terly painting, either with the pencil or the pen. Every one is familiar with he fact of Mr. Judson's sentence to, and incarceration at, the Penitentiary; but few, even of his most intimate friends, are aware how he came to be transformed, from the character of a free citizen to that of a sentened felon--  CHAINED CONVICT. The details of that conspiray, tie character of the network by which he was grad- ually drawn in and ensnared, the treachery with which he was on all sides beset- extending even to the trustiest of his friends, as well as to the very partner of his heart-ana the infamous characters in the black drama of which-he was at once. the hero and the victim--must, to be learned, be sought alone in the thrilling pages of this "hild of his hAirt as Mr. Judson is accustomed to term THE CONVICT.

AVOYE OR, THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER. By Eugene Sue.    .Price Fifty Cents. ' THS is the latest pf Sue's graphic and startling pictures of "Life" in the French metro-- . '!s. ' It is a faithful transcript of the foul, corrupt and heartless aristocracy whic 'ruled Pat is in the days of the old Regime, apd of the ignorance, superstition and vices which naturally 1 fo'wed among the people." The story is admirably told, arid like all of the'works of its cel- ebrated author, alguuds in dramatic action and tragic interest. The characters are vividly  ' drawn, and sitstained throughout with striking fidelity. Tilhe portrait of ANATALE, a coli, I. - specious, ambitious intriguer, for example, is rendered with an impressive faithfulnezs, which, 'once read,*can never be obliterated from the memory. The character of the beautiful DIANE, is a brilliant yet melancholy likeness of the easy virtue which marked the femae representa- tives of the proud, wealthy and $orrupt upper elasses of her day. The touching history of poor MARIA FAVEAU-a type of the fairer portion of the Bourgeoisc-will be read with mournful in- -tcrest. Affording as it does a vivid contrast between the morals of the upper and middling ranks, and the aitter want of protection which virtue, when allied to beauty, has in the French metropolis, against the lechery of-aristocratic libertines. The work is destined to be widely read, and to create a sensation.-- Morning Star.
