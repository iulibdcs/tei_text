            <titlePart type="desc">"All for Love," is a graphic story of Corsican life, in which the wild passions of that tameless race are vividly depicted. The magnificent caverns described in its pages actually exist in that island, and they have been used as places of concealment by the unfortunates banned by the blood vengeance which is the curse of that gem of the Mediterranean. The grand mountain scenery also receives justice at the author's hands. The story itself is deeply interesting from the first page to the last; the action is rapid, and the interest never flags.</titlePart>

               <p>WHAT quality is there in the air of mountain lands which renders their sons unconquerable? Look over the history of the civilized world, and we find that men who breathe a highland atmosphere are chainless as the eagle that dwells among their native hills. "God and freedom" are their watchwords, and the great Jehovah has never failed to smile upon those who do battle for the sacred rights of man.</p> 
               <p>There is a small sea-girt island on which this struggle has been long and arduous; in which the blood-vengeance has cursed the soil, yet among whose people the idea of constitutional liberty was acted on before Washington fought for his country's rights; before France waded through seas of blood to the phantom of freedom she now enjoys.</p> 
               <p>Corsica is little known except as the birth-place of Napoleon, yet it was there that Pasquale Paoli lived, fought, and legislated so wisely, that with a little foreign aid he might have won lasting independence as the heritage<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6335-00000004"/> of his countrymen. Such aid was not granted, and Paoli died an exile in a foreign land, but not the less revered as a patriot and a statesman because circumstances were against him. Worthy to be ranked with Washington, Paoli stands out among the sons of men as a fettered giant, struggling with almost superhuman power to break the shackles that bind the land of his birth. That he failed was not due to himself, but to those who looked on with silent sympathy, yet forbore to stretch forth a helping hand to aid the noblest struggle against fearful odds that ever has been waged.</p> 
               <p>It is to that island lying upon the blue bosom of the Mediterranean that our story leads us, and the stranger who feels the soft voluptuous air floating around him, who gazes in silent rapture upon the enchanting scenery, would scarcely dream that amid such Eden loveliness can lurk the demons of hate, despair, and death.</p> 
               <p>The crimson gleam of the setting sun is melting slowly into the purple twilight, and the azure sky begins to sparkle with stars, while the yellow disc of the full moon slowly rises as from the waves of the undulating sea stretching out in the distance.</p> 
               <p>Three lofty mountains approach the shore, covered with olive groves, and villages nestled amid their shades. As the brilliant glare of day fades into twilight, the fires of the shepherds, who dwell amid the alpine fastnesses, gleam with ruddy hues from point to point on the abrupt declivities.</p> 
               <p>The names of these mountains are Angiola, Santa Susannah, and Monte Felicet; at their base lies the town of Isola Rossa, founded by Paoli. To the right lies the peninsula of Cape Corso, the most northern point of the island, and on the left is a long projecting tongue of land, around which the sea sweeps in tranquil murmurs.</p> 
               <p>The town, with its small houses, flat roofs, and green window shutters, its wealth of shade, and its neat church, with snow-white towers, is a most picturesque and cheerful looking place.</p> 
               <p>In the sea are three red rocks over which an old tower keeps watch, carrying back the fancy to those days in which the sword of the Saracen brought terror and death to the dwellers in this lovely region.</p> 
               <p>At the entrance of the city is a spacious square, in the middle of which is a fountain surmounted by a marble bust of Paoli. This spot is the common resort of the inhabitants in the evenings, and many groups were now collected beneath the ornamental trees that cast their umbrage over the emerald sward.</p> 
               <p>A group of children had erected a cross, around which they were dancing with clasped hands, and singing with melodious voices the revolutionary song of France, the Marseillaise,-on the opposite side of the square a group gathered around a young girl who touched a guitar with much skill, and sang the national heirs of Corsica; these vocaros are either tender laments for the loss of a beloved one, or wild, terrible songs of vengeance. They are mostly composed by women, yet the horrible and the terrible are only veiled by the melancholy beauty thrown around them. They are mere improvisations, extended at pleasure by the performer, and alternately express the tenderest emotions, or the highest state of excitement, according to the skill of the singer.</p> 
               <p>The woman, who held the guitar with careless grace, was young and attractive in person, though an expression of melancholy abstraction characterized her features. She was above the medium hight, with a figure of lithe and graceful proportions, hands and feet of remarkable symmetry, and a face of such varying expression as would have rendered it interesting even had it been far plainer than hers was. But<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6335-00000005"/> her features were of that regular southern type in which beauty of proportion and delicacy of coloring are transcended by the passionate power which breathes in every line-vibrates in every thrilling tone, is read in every tremulous motion of the flexible lips, in the sweep of the heavily-fringed lids which veil large, black, melancholy eyes that reveal a tale of suffering of no common stamp.</p> 
               <p>Her dress was of dark blue material, of better quality than that usually worn by the peasantry; this was set off by a few gold ornaments, and the mandile, or head hand-kerchief, which was coiled around her head, was of such brilliant hues as harmonized with her dark and striking style of beauty. Her long, glossy black hair had escaped from its confinement, and fell in waves of jet almost to her feet, as she stood with her guitar slung across her breast by a broad scarlet ribbon; with accurate touch she struck the chords, which formed a wild accompaniment to the tones of her flexible voice, and the monotonous rhythm was calculated to produce a deep and melancholy effect upon her hearers.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly a voice spoke beside her.</p> 
               <p>"Marie Montoni, change your measure, for here comes the bridal party, and Baptisto Matra will not be likely to give a liberal douceur to one who meets him with a lament on such an occasion as this."</p> 
               <p>"True," replied Marie, vaguely, "Matra must have an epithalamium. I promised that I would compose one expressly for him, for he weds with the Pearl of Isola Rossa, the beautiful Clarice, who is my best friend."</p> 
               <p>"See that you give it pretty soon, for here they come-the old woman, the brother, sister and bridegroom-but the pretty bride is missing. I say that is shabby, now, for Clarice to refuse to come out on the eve of her bridal."</p> 
               <p>"And I say it is all right," said another. "Clarice is a lady, though she is the daughter of a peasant, and she has the whims of one. Luckily Matra has the money to uphold her in her fantasies, and that's why she's took up with him I fancy, for he isn't the handsomest man in these parts."</p> 
               <p>"Hush-h, they are close upon us. Matra has a long arm, and will not forgive an insult."</p> 
               <p>As the party thus referred to drew near, the improvisatrice changed her song of vengeance for one of love and triumph. She sang of the happiness and good fortune of the successful wooer, of the days of joy about to dawn upon him, of the pride with which the family of the bride elect would bestow upon the fortunate suitor the hand of the fairest girl in all the island.</p> 
               <p>With folded hands and placid brow, the bridegroom listened to his own praises so eloquently sung. He was a heavy, stoutly built man of fifty, with a low, retreating forehead, and a sensual mouth. There was nothing to attract the love of a young, fair girl in that repulsive face, but his dress showed that his position was better than that of most of the people who clustered around him. He wore the finest cloth, ornamented with embroidery, and a heavy chain of gold glittered upon his scarlet vest.</p> 
               <p>A large, middle-aged woman, dressed in the peasant costume, accompanied Matra, and behind them came a boy and girl of fourteen and sixteen years of age. If the Pearl of Isola Rossa was as beautiful as her friends declared her to be, she was singularly unlike her relatives, for the heavy, sallow features, and small, bead-like eyes of Senora Marcante had been transmitted to her offspring with singular fidelity, and the most partial critic could not have pronounced either of the three moderately good-looking. However, they were dressed in their best clothes, and were perfectly satisfied with the impression they believed they were making. Many<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6335-00000006"/> congratulations were offered to the bridegroom, and also to the fortunate mother who had succeeded in winning the rich trader for her son-in-law; but above all, the strains of music rang out their joyous peal, and but one among the listeners bore a discontented and bitter heart as he hearkened to the bridal hymn.</p> 
               <p>This was a young man of three or four and twenty, wearing the dress of a fisherman, with the Phrygian cap placed jauntily upon his curling black hair. His figure was tall, well-knit, and elastic, and his features had that mingled expression of boldness and tenderness which evinces a fine and noble nature; yet there was a latent gleam of fire which betrayed that in a burst of momentary passion, he might be goaded to commit an act fatal to his peace throughout all the days of his after life.</p> 
               <p>The appearance of Guilio Falcone amid the crowd caused many whispered comments, for it was known to all present that Clarice Marcante had been the love of his boyhood and youth-that for her sake he had refused to become a priest when his patron, Count Rospoli, offered to provide for him handsomely if he would take the vows. When the old nobleman insisted that his patronage should be accepted, Guilio disappeared from the neighborhood, to return after a brief absence as the captain of a lugger, ostensibly engaged in fishing, but it was secretly asserted that she carried on a contraband trade under the protection of a noted smuggler known as Captain Barnardo.</p> 
               <p>Senora Marcante listened to these stories, and turned scornfully from the young sailor, to smile upon the offers of the rich Matra; Guilio was forbidden to think of Clarice, and magnificent preparations were made for the marriage, which was now on the eve of consummation.</p> 
               <p>This was a severe blow both to the pride and the affections of the young lovers; Clarice also had resisted so long as the power to do so remained with her; but Senora Marcante was a wilful and despotic woman in her own houshold, and when she decided that the marriage should take place, there was no appeal from her authority.</p> 
               <p>The chosen bridegroom was of the wealthy bourgeois; and he had amassed a fortune by trading with the neighboring coasts of France and Italy. His villa and olive groves were among the most desirable in the vicinity of Isola Rossa, and the mother pronounced Clarice the most fortunate of girls in attracting so desirable a match; but the young girl compared the pompous, heavy Matra with the handsome and spirited young fisherman, and her heart utterly rebelled against the destiny awarded her. The rich lover seemed unconscious of, or indifferent to her feelings-he thought all women were perverse in such matters, and in time his wife would settle down quietly in the place assigned her; he had no fears as to his power to manage her, for his was a strong hand, and a relentless will.</p> 
               <p>Senora Marcante sat beside her chosen son-in-law, and listened complacently to the florid epithalamium poured forth by the wandering improvisatrice. She was a dark, keen-eyed woman, who seemed quite capable of using force if her daughter should prove rebellious; and the expression of gratified pride that rested upon her features, showed that she was quite elated by the brilliant future that opened before her family. With unwonted liberality, Matra had pledged himself to advance the interests of Pietro; and to find a marriage portion for the heavy-looking Ninetta, who sat twirling her fingers beside her.</p> 
               <p>Guilio Falcone drew near the shrewd-looking dame, and while the music rung out its monotonous rhythm, he found means to mutter in her ear:</p> 
               <p>"Mother Marcante, is it impossible to move you from your cruel purpose? Will you break my heart, and that of<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6335-00000007"/> my Clarice? for she is mine-<emph>mine</emph> in the sight of Heaven!"</p> 
               <p>This impetuous whisper caused the woman to turn her head slightly toward the speaker, and she replied in a low, taunting tone:</p> 
               <p>"Remember the proverb that belongs to your trade, and act on it, young man. The adage says, there is as good fish in the sea as ever were caught from it; angle for one of them, and leave <emph>my</emph> child for your betters; she shall never marry you, nor such as you."</p> 
               <p>A flash of lurid anger passed over the face of the young lover, and he disdainfully said, as he nodded toward Matra,</p> 
               <p>"And <emph>he,</emph> with his mean face, his meaner nature, is considered worthy to win and wear <emph>my</emph> betrothed, because he can claim a little more gold than I possess. Money is good, but it cannot buy heart-love like that between Clarice and me. Oh! Mother Marcante, do not drive us to desperation. Stop this marriage, and let Clarice come to my home, for I have one to offer her. I have labored for her-I have found a nest in which she can be happy, and lo! when I came into the harbor to cast anchor, the news was hurled at me that you were about to give my bride to yonder lump of flesh and stupidity. Is this right? is it just to two young people that are devoted to each other? You do not know what may yet come of all this."</p> 
               <p>"Guilio," replied the Senora, impressively, "listen to me: You have ever been a wild and wayward youth, but I do not believe you have in you the stuff that will make a bandit. You have lived upon the sea, and the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchia</foreign>

I advise you not to attempt anything desperate, because <emph>my</emph> daughter is quite beyond your reach, and will always remain so. If I would not give her to you as a peaceful, well-to-do lad, I would scarcely permit her to follow your fortunes if you dare to invoke the blood vengeance. There! I hope that is plain enough, young man."</p> 
               <p>At this moment the melody abruptly ceased, and Guilio drew away, muttering some unintelligible words, which were drowned in the vociferous applause which greeted the musician.</p> 
               <p>Matra spoke in loud, pompous tones:</p> 
               <p>"Well done, Marie; I am charmed with your bridal song, and since you have praised me so judiciously I will double the compensation I intended to give you."</p> 
               <p>A faint smile, half scornful in its meaning, passed over the lips of the improvisatrice, as she held out her hand for the promised guerdon, and she briefly said:</p> 
               <p>"My service is performed, and I must be gone before the sun rises on your wedding day. I sing of marriages, but they are not in my line. The scathed heart has nothing to do with love and joy, though the lips may sing of its fullness. The hopes crushed out in blood may never blossom again."</p> 
               <p>She spoke in a vague, half dreamy manner, and her eyes were fixed upon the distant sea, over whose restless waters the moon was now pouring a flood of yellow radiance.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Marie," was muttered by those around her. "Hers was indeed a tragic history-so young, so fair, yet so unfortunate!"</p> 
               <p>Matra drew forth a small gold coin, and placed it in the outstretched palm of the singer.</p> 
               <p>"I am told that you also possess the power of divination. Read me my fate, good Marie, and keep the gold unchanged."</p> 
               <p>He held forth his fat, white hand, which looked clammy<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6335-00000008"/> and cold. The girl glanced upon the lines traced within its palm, shuddered, and tendered him back the coin.</p> 
               <p>"I know nothing of palmistry," she said. "Take back your gold, and give me such guerdon as my song has merited."</p> 
               <p>"Nay, nay, keep it, fair Marie, though I should be glad to have you read my future."</p> 
               <p>"Why should you ask it?" she vaguely replied. "Are you not a successful man in all your undertakings? Fortune smiles on you, and love offers its crown to your life; what more dare you ask of Fate than has already been granted you? Why seek to lift the veil from the future, when the bright sunshine is upon the present? Better bask in its warm beams, and pray to the holy virgin that it may never be worse with you than now."</p> 
               <p>"She speaks words of wisdom," said Senora Marcante, "and the priest says it is sinful to pry into the ways of Providence. Enjoy the good that is sent us, bear the evil when it falls; that is the true philosophy of life."</p> 
               <p>The dark eyes of the improvisatrice were fixed upon the speaker, with an expression of intense sadness, and she spoke with inexpressible bitterness.</p> 
               <p>"Life has no other philosophy than <emph>endurance.</emph> What God sends to his creatures they <emph>must</emph> bear, and that is an end of the matter. Mother Marcante, can I find shelter beneath your roof a few hours to-night. I promised Clarice to see her once more before I leave the town, and I must do so without delay."</p> 
               <p>The old woman regarded her with an expression of suspicion, while she slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"No one willingly turns away the smitten of God, and you are welcome to the shelter of my roof, Marie Montoni, if you are true to me and mine."</p> 
               <p>"True to the best interests of your daughter you will ever find me," replied Marie, composedly. "Why should you now doubt my devotion to her, good mother?"</p> 
               <p>"If you are true to her <emph>interests,</emph> I can trust you; for they lead her to the altar with Baptisto Matra, to place the nuptial ring upon her finger."</p> 
               <p>Marie bowed her head as if in assent, and the dame added:</p> 
               <p>"Then come with me, and talk reasonably with the wayward girl, who will see no grandeur in the future, no joy in the life that opens so fairly before her. Oh! children are vexatious and ungrateful creatures. While parents seek to do the best they can for them, they often try to thwart their efforts for their advancement. It's a weary world, a weary world, in spite of all the angels in Heaven are constantly trying to do for us."</p> 
               <p>Marie shook her head dubiously as she glanced at the repulsive face of Matra, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid the angels had little to do with this, but I will talk with Clarice, as you wish me to do. I am afraid we are all too much like the ungrateful children of whom you just now spoke, and we carry out our own will while professing to follow the dictates of Heaven."</p> 
               <p>Dame Marcante looked sharply at her, but as the speaker seemed wrapped in a species of dreamy trance, in which she appeared scarcely conscious of the purport of her own words, the good woman turned to Matra, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It grows late, and I have much to attend to to-morrow. It is best to seek my home, and rest before labor. You, too, Senor, will need repose to prepare yourself for the happiness that awaits you. Long life to you, my son, in which to enjoy prosperity with my fortunate daughter."</p> 
               <p>The bridegroom sleepily returned his thanks for her good wishes, and with some effort arose from the comfortable seat he occupied. He placed himself beside Marie, but she<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6335-00000009"/> seemed to recoil from him with some inexplicable feeling of repulsion, and glided around the portly form of Senora Marcante till she found Ninetta, whose hand she grasped as her companion in their homeward walk. Grateful for the preference thus shown, the young girl said:</p> 
               <p>"I will show you my beautiful dress, Marie. Oh, it is grand to have such a fine wedding, and so rich a brother as Senor Matra will be!"</p> 
               <p>Marie's lip curled, but she absently replied:</p> 
               <p>"Yes-very grand, Ninetta, if poor Clarice could only think as you do."</p> 
               <p>"Clarice is so strange. She never does think as mother and I do. Mother says she is too fanciful to belong to any but a rich man, and it must then be right to give her to Matra, even if she does not care particularly for him. Mother says she will learn to love him in time."</p> 
               <p>The dark eyes of the listener emitted a flash as they were turned indignantly upon the simple prattler, but the vacant face that met her view caused a sudden revulsion of feeling. She laughed bitterly as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps your mother is right; but in my opinion time will come to an end for us all before Clarice learns the lesson that has been set for her. Poor girl! I wish it were otherwise."</p> 
               <p>"Then she will prove very perverse," retorted Ninetta, with a pout. "If Matra had given <emph>me</emph> all the beautiful things that he has sent my sister, I should think him the greatest man in the world."</p> 
               <p>Marie made no reply to this, and the two followed in the steps of the elder couple, while Pietro skipped along in pursuit of the fire-flies that flitted around them. The soft sea breeze moved the foliage of the trees, and the bright moon flooded the bay with a light almost as clear as that of day. The children still sang their wild war chant, and the tinkle of the citera was heard from many different points as the party pursued their way toward Dame Marcante's humble domicile.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AM I YOUR DAUGHTER?</head> 
               <p>THE cottage nestled in a secluded nook near the sandy beach, and within sight of its windows lay the dark hull and tapering masts of Guilio Falcone's bark, making ready to go on another voyage. A pathway from the landing wound upward to the widow's door, which, until of late, had been familiar to the feet of the handsome fisherman; and the fair Clarice, who on the morrow was to give her hand to Baptisto Matra, had often lingered upon it with her hand clasped in Falcone's, and her eyes beaming with that deep passionate love which both believed to be indestructible.</p> 
               <p>Now it was seldom trodden by her, for her mother kept too strict a watch upon her movements to permit such wanderings from the path she was resolute her child should walk in.</p> 
               <p>Clarice was the beauty of Isola Rossa, and when the wealthy Matra was attracted by her fair face, she was allowed no voice in the arrangement which gave her hand to him as his wife. To be elevated to the position of mistress of a villa, with servants and lands, was too great good fortune to be cast away for love forsooth. That was but a dream, while this was a tangible reality, whose blessings would increase and multiply as time rolled on.</p> 
               <p>Thus reasoned Senora Marcante, and Clarice listened with a rebellious heart, which shrank and quivered with<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6335-00000010"/> pain when she thought of her beloved Guilio; of the happy future they had planned together, and she thrilled with repulsion as she compared him with her ungainly bridegroom.</p> 
               <p>The cottage stood upon a ledge overlooking the sea; it was of humble pretensions, though it was a comfortable home in that genial climate, and was kept with a degree of neatness not often found among people of the widow's class. Fruit trees grew around it, and a vine trailed its green foliage over the walls, making it a complete nest of verdure.</p> 
               <p>Matra bade the party good-night at the base of the ascent, saying that as they were now safe in sight of the door, he would seek his own home, and spare himself the fatigue of going up with them. Senora Marcante replied to this with cordial emphasis:</p> 
               <p>"It will be best so, my son; adieu till to-morrow, and may the holy Mother of God have you in her keeping. Her blessing upon your union with Clarice is, I believe, already assured."</p> 
               <p>"I trust so," replied the bridegroom, as he turned toward his own domicile.</p> 
               <p>Marie looked after his receding figure, and she scornfully said:</p> 
               <p>"A lover worth the care of the Holy Mary would have gone on with us for the chance of a moment's interview with the object of his affections. Oh! Mother Marcante, do you hope that Clarice can ever be happy with that ton of flesh yonder? A fish from the sea has as much sensibility as Matra has, and Clarice is all tenderness and truthfulness."</p> 
               <p>"That may be true, but still I have chosen wisely for her. Clarice is fair and delicate; she is not suited to bear the burden of a hard life. Baptisto can make her a lady in station, as nature has made her one in taste and refinement. Trust me, Marie, that I am doing what in the end will be best for my daughter's happiness."</p> 
               <p>"I wish I could think so. With one she loves, Clarice would cheerfully bear privations even; but in the case of her new home, her spirit will fret itself forever against the enforced bonds that will bind her to such a man as you are about to bestow her on."</p> 
               <p>"If such are your sentiments, I think you had better not seek Clarice to-night," said Senora Mercante, drily. "It is too late <unclear>to</unclear> preach against the marriage now, for every arrangement is completed, and she shall surely become the wife of Matra on the morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Clarice has my promise to see her once more before I leave Isola Rossa; but you need fear nothing from me <emph>now.</emph> The fate of your child is already decided, and I shall not lift my finger to change it. Will this assurance satisfy you?"</p> 
               <p>The woman ungraciously replied:</p> 
               <p>"I suppose it must, for you are always wilful, and at the last moment Clarice may prove unmanageable if I keep you away from her. See her, then, and bear from her her last farewell to the presumptuous Guilio, for it is he who will watch for you when you leave my cottage, I very well know. See-I am secure of the game I am playing, or I would never permit this interview between you."</p> 
               <p>As she ceased speaking, they reached the cottage door, which stood open to receive them. It consisted of a large central room, with doors on either side opening from it into the apartments of the family.</p> 
               <p>An iron lamp, of antique shape, hung from the centre of the ceiling, and in the full glare of the light which fell from it, sat a young girl with her hands clasped upon her lap in an attitude of hopeless dejection.</p> 
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6335-00000011"/> 
               <p>Her light and graceful figure was clad in a robe of pale sea-green, with a jacket of some brilliant figured material, fitted perfectly to her form; her heavy suit of lustrous auburn hair was partially covered by the usual Corsican head-dress, a mandile white as drifted snow, with a border of fine red stripes closely woven together.</p> 
               <p>Clarice was scarcely seventeen years of age, but her form was rounded into perfect womanhood, and there was a world of passionate thought and feeling in the deep dark eyes and flexible lips of this young creature thus early placed in a position of such pain and peril; for the overbearing mother was far from comprehending the actual condition of her daughter's affairs. She did not see the conflict raging in that bosom between love and duty-the struggle between ambition and passion, for ambition was the ruling trait in that yet undeveloped nature, and its promptings bade her give her hand to Matra, while every voice in her better nature pleaded for him she truly loved.</p> 
               <p>She did not rise when the two women entered, but kept her eyes fixed upon the floor as if in deep meditation. Dame Marcante sharply spoke:</p> 
               <p>"How now, Clarice; I expected to find you in bed and asleep. A pretty-looking bride will you be to-morrow, with that woe-begone face and stupid look. Of what are you dreaming, child?"</p> 
               <p>"Of despair-death," replied the girl, drearily, lifting her eyes to the face of the speaker. "Do you think that I can sleep when my heart is torn with anguish? When hope has knocked at it for the last time? Oh, mother! I would that I were dead-dead-dead!"</p> 
               <p>Her voice died away in a feeble wail, and her head drooped upon her bosom in an attitude of hopeless dejection Senora Marcante roughly shook her by the shoulders, as she said in harsh tones:</p> 
                
               <p>"Are you determined to play the fool to the very last hour? Get up, go to your room, and get to bed. Any girl, with common sense, would exult in the grand future that opens to you to-morrow. You leave the peasant's cot to play the part of the great lady, and yet you talk of despair and death. Stuff! you'll laugh at all these heroics one of these days."</p> 
               <p>"If I do, it will not be as Matra's wife. No laugh will ever come to my lip, when once his kiss has polluted it."</p> 
               <p>"We shall see, all in good time. I have no fears for you when the words have been really said; you will come to you right reason then. Here is Marie Montoni to speak with you. I permitted her to come, though I knew it was giving you a last chance to send a message to that impudent fisher lad, who would drag you down to his level by making you the sharer of his wretched poverty."</p> 
               <p>"Guilio is not poor; he is rich enough for one brought up as I have been, and I would rather mend his nets, and help him draw them with my own hands, than give it to this man you are forcing me to wed. Oh, Marie, good Marie, plead for me, for in this hour I am desperate."</p> 
               <p>She grasped the hand of the singer with such force that she could scarcely repress a cry of pain as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Words will now be useless, Clarice. Your mother has shown me her mind, and I am afraid she is immovable. Come with me and let me talk with you. I have calmed you before to-night, and caused you to listen to the voice of reason. You have always found good to flow from following my advice."</p> 
               <p>Clarice arose mechanically, and placed her hand in that of her friend. As the two turned towards the door leading into one of the side apartments, Marie said to the mother:</p> 
               <p>"Have no fears, mother Marcante, that I shall seek to influence Clarice against your wishes. Her fate is now placed beyond my control."</p> 
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6335-00000012"/> 
               <p>She mentally added, "And yours, too, for others are circumventing you fast enough without any aid from me. I may safely promise anything now."</p> 
               <p>The two girls entered the room of Clarice, and closed the door. It was small, with a single window which opened upon the bay, and commanded a view of the cove in which Falcone's lugger lay moored. Beside this was placed the crucifix, before which the poor girl offered up her prayers for his welfare, and while her orisons ascended to Heaven, her eyes could behold the beacon light which assured her of the presence and safety of her earthly idol.</p> 
               <p>She sunk down before the altar, bowed her head, and raised her clasped hands imploringly toward the head of Christ crowned with thorns, and her pale lips muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon and guidance, oh Friend of the friendless, for I am in a dire strait. Thou knowest my heart; oh, give me strength, give me courage, to walk in the path appointed to me. Let me not falter or grow weak."</p> 
               <p>Marie Montoni watched the wan face and pleading lips of Clarice with vivid interest, and while she is thus engaged, we will give a sketch of the heroic story of her own broken life.</p> 
               <p>At sixteen she was the betrothed bride of a daring Corsican who plotted against the enemies of his country. The conspiracy was revealed to the French commander, and the ringleaders were arrested and broken on the wheel, that most terrible of all cruel punishments. Among them was the youthful betrothed of poor Marie. He perished with manly courage, but his enemies refused to him the right of sepulture; the bodies of the slain patriots were exposed in the public square, and the penalty of death denounced against those who attempted to remove them.</p> 
               <p>Marie sat alone in her desolation, and to her excited senses the voice of her dead lover seemed ever beside her, wailing in her ears:</p> 
                
               <p>"The birds of prey tear my flesh, and no faithful heart is found to lay me in the tomb of my fathers."</p> 
               <p>The cry maddened her, and she was resolute to remove her martyred lover from the ignoble position he occupied. On a dark and starless night, Marie enveloped her form in a black faldetta, a national garment, the back extremity of which is thrown over the head in such a manner as to resemble a nun's hooded cloak.</p> 
               <p>Favored by the gloom of the night and this sombre garment, the heroic girl glided past the sentinel, and reached the square on which lay the corpses of those gallant men exposed to the dews of night, and the scorching sun of day. Last in the row lay the body of her beloved Antonio.</p> 
               <p>Nerving herself to the task, she passed the others, lifted the body of her lover, and bore it within a neigboring monastery, beneath the floor of which lay the burial vault of the dead man's family. With superhuman strength she gained the marble slab above its mouth, sat down in the dim light that came from a chapel near by, and sustained the ghastly head of Antonio upon her lap.</p> 
               <p>Tears and caresses were lavished upon the lifeless remains, and then she slid the body into the vault beneath, closed its mouth, and kneeling above it, offered prayers for the repose of his soul.</p> 
               <p>Marie gained her home in safety, and on the following day the family of Antonio were arrested on suspicion of violating the orders of the French commander. No sooner was this news conveyed to her than the real culprit presented herself before the officer, and confessed her guilt. She said:</p> 
               <p>"I have given burial to the remains of my betrothed. Let my life be the atonement, that the innocent may go free."</p> 
               <p>At first he was incredulous, but when convinced that this<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6335-00000013"/> deed of heroism had actually been performed by a young and slender girl, he gave her her freedom, and ordered that the other bodies should be removed and buried. The parents of Marie were dead, and her relatives cast her off to lead the life of a wandering improvisatrice. From her musical talent she gleaned a precarious existence, and as her history was generally known throughout the island, shelter was never denied to her by a people who are singularly alive to every trait of heroism, and ready to excuse crime itself, if it is backed by the wild daring which forms the groundwork of their national character.</p> 
               <p>She also possessed another claim upon their sympathies. The vague sadness which became the predominant phase of her mind often gave her the air of a person whose senses have wandered beyond the control of their possessor; and the wild inspirations she sometimes uttered to the music of her guitar, gave her among the common people the reputation of a seeress.</p> 
               <p>Mysterious as the oracles of Delphi these utterances often were, but a weird significance was attached to them in the minds of the listeners, and few would willingly have offended the wandering musician, from the superstitious fear that the familiar spirits with whom they believed her in constant communion, would find means to avenge any slight put upon her.</p> 
               <p>From this feeling arose the consent of Senora Marcante to the interview between the reluctant bride-elect and her self-invited guest. She would willingly have played the spy upon the two friends, but the fear that the attendant spirit of the girl might reveal her espionage to Marie, withheld her. A belief in witchcraft is wide spread in Corsica, and Senora Marcante was not superior to the majority of her compatriots.</p> 
               <p>At length Clarice arose from her devotions, and turned her pale face toward her friend. She looked into her eyes, and saw burning in their dark depths a vivid light very different from the soft dreaminess that usually characterized them. She knew that Marie was ready to take some decided part in the drama of her own life which was to open with more than one striking tableau on the morrow.</p> 
               <p>She rapidly whispered:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Marie? What have you to tell me? Did Guilio come upon the square? Did he-did he speak to my mother?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he did, and she roughly repelled him. Clarice, darling, there is no hope from that quarter. Your mother intends to give your hand to-morrow to the rich Matra, and, save in your own resolution, there is no help for you."</p> 
               <p>"That will not fail me now, for I tell you there <emph>must,</emph> there shall be help for me. God will not permit me to be forced into a marriage with Baptisto Matra, when I am in the sight of Heaven already a wife."</p> 
               <p>Marie started, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean? I cannot understand you, Clarice."</p> 
               <p>"I only mean that I have solemnly plighted my troth to Guilio, and I dare not break the pledge I have given him. We have knelt together at the shrine of the Virgin, and repeated the form of the betrothal. He placed the bridal ring upon my finger, and I wear it concealed in my boddice. I look upon the vow taken, when this circlet of gold was accepted, as binding as if the priest had made us one flesh. Yes, Marie, I feel that in God's holy sight I am truly the wife of Guilio, and it is wicked even to think of giving myself to another."</p> 
               <p>Marie gravely shook her head.</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid your mother will scarcely view it in the same light, for she has declared that nothing shall prevent you from becoming the wife of Matra."</p> 
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6335-00000014"/> 
               <p>"My mother never loved me," replied Clarice, with a burst of passionate weeping. "She gave me advantages superior to those of my station, but I have always felt that her affections were given alone to Ninetta and Pietro. Why, then, shall I sacrifice myself to please her?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is it; she has reared you for a higher station than you were born to fill, and she is only carrying out her plan by giving you to one who is rich enough to make a lady of you, and who is desperately enamored of you. I promised to say nothing against her plans, and I will not, but I say to you that hope is not yet dead and buried under Matra's piles of gold. If Guilio is what I take him to be, he will never let you be torn from him in this manner."</p> 
               <p>A knock came to the door, and Senora Marcante's head was thrust into the room.</p> 
               <p>"You talk too late. Clarice, you must sleep a few hours, or your eyes will lose all their brightness. "Marie, too, needs rest. I insist that you shall put out the light, and retire."</p> 
               <p>Clarice coldly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Since it is your last night of authority over me, Madame, I obey you. I have little further to say to Marie; all that remains to me now is to prepare for the event of the morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Come, now, that is rational. I thought you would listen to reason when you found opposition to my will to be quite useless. Sleep in peace, that your cheeks may be blooming, and your nerves steady when you stand before the priest as the bride of the wealthiest trader in Isola Rossa. Think what a beautiful house you will have; how fine your dress will be. Ah, you will be the envy of every girl of your acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"For what, Madame?" asked the girl, with bitterness. "For the grace and elegance of my betrothed? for the nobility of his character? the generosity of his nature? Those only are legitimate causes of envy, and not the mean dazzle of gold, which, if report speaks truly, has been won by any other than upright and honorable means. Yes-they will do well to envy me my lover. I can only say, that any one among them is quite welcome to take him, with all his possessions, even if they were ten times as great as they are, for I set no value either on Senor Matra or his wealth."</p> 
               <p>"Then you are a stupid and ungrateful creature, who is unworthy to be elevated to the pinnacle of prosperity by the efforts of those connected with you. I have done all I could to bring about this marriage, and whether you thank me or not, it shall certainly take place. I am glad that Matra takes you to-morrow under his own charge, for I am tired of your caprices and impertinence."</p> 
               <p>Clarice listened disdainfully; she turned her eyes with a searching expression upon the old woman, as she suddenly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Madame, are you really entitled to claim from me a <emph>daughter's</emph> obedience? Answer me truly, as Heaven shall judge you."</p> 
               <p>At this unexpected question Senora Marcante recoiled, and grew visibly paler; but she recovered instantly, and, with a derisive laugh, replied:</p> 
               <p>"I am willing to abide its judgment; are you not my child? To whom else, then, should your obedience be due?"</p> 
               <p>"That is the question I myself asked; for your harshness toward me, your want of affection for me, compel me at times to doubt the relationship. Am I your daughter or that of the stranger who, seventeen years ago, found refuge in this cottage and died here?"</p> 
               <p>The unexpected nature of this question evidently disconcerted Senora Marcante, for she became extremely pale, as she faltered:</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6335-00000015"/> 
               <p>"What absurd stories have you been listening to? What do you know of a stranger who once came hither in distress?"</p> 
               <p>"I know much about her, and the stories cannot be so absurd if they produce the effect I now witness. Speak, Madame, am I your child or that of the stranger who came in darkness and storm, to ask for shelter for herself and the infant she carried in her arms?"</p> 
               <p>Senora Marcante turned to Marie with an assumed expression of commiseration, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Clarice is growing mad. I am afraid that Baptisto will be forced to put her in a lunatic asylum before the honeymoon is over. Poor child! it is fearful to have the temper get the better of the judgment thus. Can you not bring her to a more rational state, good Marie? Persuade her to retire, and dismiss this absurd fancy from her mind. Not my own child, indeed! Why should I have kept her through all these long years, and given her every advantage that a nobleman's daughter might have claimed, if she belonged to another person?"</p> 
               <p>"Because you were well paid to do so," said Clarice, still intently regarding her. "No-I am not mad yet; I keep that last phase of misery till you have really made me the wife of Matra. Then, I may go mad at my leisure, for I shall have nothing else to do."</p> 
               <p>"You shall have the chance to try it, at all events," replied Dame Marcante, angrily; "for you shall be the wife of Baptisto before twenty-four hours have rolled away. My authority shall not be set at naught by you, on the silly ground that you are the child of some other person. An Italian lady once dwelt in my house. She had enjoyed wealth and high station; but she died in my arms a few hours after her child went to the angels, and both are buried in the church yard. It is ridiculous for you, Clarice Marcante cante, to set yourself up as the descendant of a high born woman. You, who are of peasant blood! ha! ha! it makes me laugh."</p> 
               <p>Clarice glanced toward the mirror in which her patrician head was reflected, and a haughty smile curved her lips, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I do not believe that plebeian blood flows in my veins. Look at me-compare me with the two children to whom all your love is given, and tell me if we bear the same seal from the hand of divinity. You treat me as an alien, you crush my hopes without remorse, and yet you claim the sacred name of mother. My heart refuses to acknowledge the tie. Daily, for months, has the conviction been growing upon me that I have no claim of blood upon you. Wherefore, then, attempt to force me into a marriage which must render me miserable?"</p> 
               <p>The woman sneered, though she evidently trembled. She spoke, in a husky voice:</p> 
               <p>"Go to bed, Clarice, and sleep off this fit of heroics. To-morrow you will be calm, and willing to see that your mother knows best what is for your welfare. No beggarly fisherman shall claim child of mine for his wife. You shall have houses and lands, silks and jewels, in the place of the spoils of the sea as your only portion. Marie, reason with this silly child, and bring her to her sober senses."</p> 
               <p>"Leave her with me, and I will see what can be done," replied Marie. "You are both excited now, and had better separate."</p> 
               <p>Dame Marcante raised her voice to its most positive pitch as she said:</p> 
               <p>"Good night, then, and see that you heed my warning. There is no escape from this house to-night; the path to the sea is watched, as is that toward the hills, for Matra shall not be foiled of his bride to-morrow."</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6335-00000016"/> 
               <p>With this information she left the room, and after a whispered consultation between the two girls they threw themselves upon the bed and endeavored to sleep.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">MAKING READY FOR FLIGHT.</head> 
               <p>SUDDENLY Clarice aroused herself from the dreamy reverie into which she seemed to have fallen, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is your opinion, Marie? Has Senora Marcante the <emph>right</emph> to force me into Matra's arms, when my whole soul recoils with inexpressible loathing from the thought of becoming his wife? I mean has she the sacred right of motherhood to bend me to her will of iron? for that is a strong tie to be rent by violence. You are wise beyond most people; you can read the human heart. Am I free to act for myself, or is she my sovereign mistress by right of maternity?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know-I cannot tell. What passed here just now has raised strange doubts in my mind as to your true origin. Yet if you are not the child of plebeian parents, Guilio is no fitting mate for you."</p> 
               <p>Clarice lifted her lithe form with a movement of pride, and her voice quivered with intense emotion as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"Were I a princess born, Guilio would still be my king, for I love him with the strength of my nature, and my soul bends down in homage before him as my true lord and ruler. He is noble and true in every impulse of his nature, and no knightly ancestry is needed to emblazon his worth. Guilio has bestowed on me the royal gift of his affections, and I have responded to them with my whole being. If, as I have dreamed, I am of gentle blood, I have been cast off by those who should have owned me long ere this, and to their prejudices of birth or fortune I owe no allegiance, even if they should seek me out at this late day to do me justice. Fate has bound up my life with that of Guilio Falcone, and when he bears me from the altar on which they would offer me as a sacrifice to avarice and pride, I give myself to him without reserve. I am, from that moment, his own true wife as long as life shall last."</p> 
               <p>Marie shuddered.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, it will be a terrible scene, Clarice. Blood, blood will surely be shed in the melee."</p> 
               <p>A tone of fierceness vibrated in the voice of Clarice as she vehemently replied:</p> 
               <p>"If it does flow, it will be from the heart of my enemy. It is his life staked against mine; for I will thrust this dagger into my heart if the priest completes the ceremony which binds me to Baptisto Matra."</p> 
               <p>She drew a sharp stiletto from a case concealed in her bosom, and held it aloft, while a wild, exulting smile parted her lips.</p> 
               <p>"Should my lover fail to rescue me, my enfranchised soul will thus rush forth to join the great caravan of death, which gains strength with every passing moment. Oh! it will be far easier to die than to live on as the wife of that senseless, soulless mass of clay to which my mother would give me. <emph>Mother!</emph> no, mine lies in the grave behind the church, and this hard and cruel tyrant has usurped her name."</p> 
               <p>"Since you are so resolute not to marry Matra, why did you not elope with Guilio when you met him on the shore to-night?" asked Marie. "It would save much future suffering to all concerned."</p> 
               <p>"We knew that we were watched, and his bark could not<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6335-00000017"/> be prepared for our flight before the morning. Besides, his friend Barnardo will join him to-night, and Guilio relies on his assistance to render our escape certain."</p> 
               <p>"Barnardo! what, the suspected smuggler? Is he the friend of Guilio?" asked Marie, with interest.</p> 
               <p>"I believe he is the same person; I know he is spoken of with caution, but he is a fast and brave friend in the hour of need. His felucca will enter the bay to-night, and her quick sailing will enable us to baffle our pursuers tomorrow. But, Marie, dear Marie, tell me truly. Look into the mirror of Fate, and reveal to me if I am the victim of a fantasy, or am I indeed the thrall of Senora Marcante? As <emph>her</emph> child, I shall scarcely have courage to bring upon her the punishment which may be exacted, should blood be spilled in my rescue."</p> 
               <p>"On what grounds do you doubt your relationship to her?" asked Marie.</p> 
               <p>Clarice had risen, and was standing in front of an old-fashioned Venetian mirror which hung above a carved ebony stand; this was a singular article of furniture to be found in a peasant's cottage. Her eyes wandered to her own person, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"Look at me, Marie. There is not a trace of resemblance between me and the other members of this family. My nature is not kindred to theirs, and an inner voice seems to cry out forever that I am not of them. Senora Marcante has ever treated me harshly, and this last harshness in forcing me into a marriage which must render me a miserable, perjured wretch, almost convinces me that she cannot really be my mother."</p> 
               <p>Marie sorrowfully regarded her.</p> 
               <p>"My poor Clarice, your mind must indeed wander, or you would never have entertained such a fantasy. Whose child can you possibly be, if not hers? Were you not born in this town? cannot every villager around give testimony to the fact that you have grown up among them as Clarice Marcante?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and to much more than that," replied the young girl, eagerly. "Look at this stand-this mirror-at yonder chest of drawers, and call to mind the story of the lady to whom they once belonged. She came hither, a refugee from Italy the year I was born, and bore with her a babe a few weeks old. There was also a child in this cottage; one of the infants died; it was said to be the stranger's babe, but I sometimes doubt it. My reputed mother's hardness makes me feel that she who really deserves the name is lying in her grave, and I am only a changeling."</p> 
               <p>"If this were true, Clarice, what would you gain by the exchange? You are now known as the child of respectable though humble parents. The history of this stranger can only be guessed at, and may have been such as would not bear examination. She died of a broken heart, alone, deserted by her former friends; yet she had money, for it was the sum bequeathed by her to Mother Marcante that has given her the comfortable position she now enjoys."</p> 
               <p>"And that money enabled her to afford me such advantages of education as have lifted me above the class to which I am supposed to belong. Much as she loves her own children, Senora Marcante has made no effort to elevate them above their true position."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps because she saw it would be a useless task. Your mother does not lack judgment, and she can see what is best for each one of her children. Dismiss this wild fancy, Clarice, and let us talk rationally together. Before dawn I must leave you, and Guilio will be awaiting me upon my path, to hear such words as you may send to him now. I have promised your mother not to play the traitor to her, but I have her permission to bear your farewell<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6335-00000018"/> message to the poor lad who has loved you so long and faithfully."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and who merits better treatment than to be falsely deserted now. Tell him this, Marie Montoni, and take heed that you repeat my words exactly as I say them. 'The mountains are high, and the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchi</foreign> is thick, but I fear neither, if the hand of a loved one guides me through them.'"</p> 
               <p>Marie shuddered as she looked upon the glittering eyes and colorless face of the excited girl. She said:</p> 
               <p>"Clarice, your words vindicate your claim to Corsican descent. Do you know that they proclaim a vendetta, and your hand is to be won at the price of blood?"</p> 
               <p>"Matra's blood or mine must be shed, for I repeat that I will take my own life sooner than give myself to Baptisto. I loathe him. In the sight of heaven I am already the bride of another; and Guilio must claim me at all hazards, for I will not live through the day that forces me to wed his rival."</p> 
               <p>"Would you indeed have courage to take your own life? To rush upon the unknown future! Dear Clarice, do not speak thus, for it quite unnerves me."</p> 
               <p>"Courage! yes-to die true to my love; but not to live the false and mean life that must become mine as the wedded wife of Baptisto Matra. Marie, at my command Guilio sought my mother on the public square, and made a last appeal to her. It failed, and now extreme measures are pardonable. I will fly to the hills with the man of my choice, and with him endure hardships of every kind, sooner than link my fate with that of the loathsome creature they have chosen for me."</p> 
               <p>"But how are you to escape now?"</p> 
               <p>"A daring heart knows how to plan and execute. Guilio is no craven; let him hold forth his hand, and I will spring to clasp it as my safeguard and defence. Enough-I trust him, and he knows it."</p> 
               <p>"And your mother-"</p> 
               <p>"Is such no longer, even in name. The outlaw's bride will claim no kindred but him for whose sake she gives up all. No home, save the wide canopy of heaven, with its golden stars."</p> 
               <p>"You can never bear the hardships of such a life. Poor child! you do not dream of what is actually before you."</p> 
               <p>"Have <emph>you</emph> not led a wandering life, and fared hardly enough, yet you are <emph>alone.</emph> I shall be with him I love; his arm will sustain me when I falter, his lips breathe hope to me when I grow weak; he will make my wild life beautiful with his tenderness. Oh! Marie, is not this far, far better than to wear my heart out with weariness in the luxurious ease which is its alternative? Shut up in my gilded cage, as the prisoner of Matra, I should pine and die. Away in the free mountains, sharing the life of him I love, I shall be happy in spite of privations."</p> 
               <p>Her face lost its pallor-a fine carnation tint spread over her cheeks, lighting up her eyes with an expression of heroic tenderness, which was inexpressibly captivating.</p> 
               <p>Marie caught her enthusiasm, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"You are right, Clarice. Your soul is no fitting mate for such as Baptisto Matra. I have already said as much to your mother, but she could not view the affair in the same light."</p> 
               <p>"It matters not now," replied Clarice, with decision. "Let Guilio act promptly, and I am ready to follow him to the hills. No true heart will blame me, for I have been forced to take this course. Repeat my words to Guilio, and he will know that my heart is firm-that all doubts have departed. I give him freedom to act."</p> 
               <p>An hour before dawn, the improvisatrice emerged from<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6335-00000019"/> the cottage of Dame Marcante, and by the light of the stars found her way down a narrow path which wound toward the sea. She glanced searchingly around her as she cautiously threaded her way toward a clump of bushes a few hundred yards from the house. A dark form started from its shelter, and in guarded but eager tones the voice of Guilio said:</p> 
               <p>"You have seen her, Marie! My angel knows that the appeal to her mother was vain. Is her courage now equal to the venture? Speak, I conjure you, for my soul is on fire to learn if her heart is as strong as I know it is tender."</p> 
               <p>"You do not trust her too far. Clarice will be true as steel, as you will confess when I repeat her own words to you."</p> 
               <p>"And they were-"</p> 
               <p>"'The mountains are high, and the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchi</foreign> is thick, but I fear neither, if the hand of a loved one guides me through them.'"</p> 
               <p>A suppressed cry of exultation burst from the lover's lips, and he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"My own noble and true one! Never shall she have cause to repent her trust in me. I will rescue her, or die in the attempt."</p> 
               <p>"But have you reflected on what is to be the price of success?" asked Marie, with a shiver. "In this land of blood vengeance, a fearful penalty may be exacted."</p> 
               <p>"True; yet I must risk taking the life of my rival; if he falls, I am thenceforward an outlaw; but how many good and noble men have submitted to the same fate in this unhappy land of ours. I shall only add one more to the ranks of those who prefer wild freedom to ignoble bondage. Like a craven, I will never stand by and see the girl of my heart given to a mean, senseless clod of clay, who, but for the gold he has dishonestly scraped together, would only be considered fit to grovel in the wayside ditch."</p> 
                
               <p>"Yet it will be a sad thing to bring blood-guiltiness upon your head, Guilio. To tear a tender fragile creature like Clarice from a comfortable home, to throw her upon the chances of the wild life you must lead."</p> 
               <p>Guilio laughed triumphantly, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have my secret too, Marie; but it is one I shall not betray just now. As to my darling Clarice, my love shall be her shield and her trust. Better for such as she the mountain side, with a true arm to sustain her steps, than the silken home in which dullness and hate would take up their abode. Clarice could never live a week as the wife of Matra; but with me she will be happy, in spite of evil fortunes; yet the last I do not fear. I have enough-more than enough. Ah! you shall soon see that fairy land has not exhausted all its marvels yet."</p> 
               <p>There was a tone of joyous confidence in his voice which unconsciously inspired Marie with a portion of his own courage, and she inquired:</p> 
               <p>"What then are your plans? Mother Marcante is confident that the wedding will come off to-morrow, with all the ceremonies usually practised among our people, and your movements must be carefully planned, or you may yet be baffled."</p> 
               <p>"In those very ceremonies lie my hopes of success. I shall play my part in the festival, the end of which will be a little different from that which Senora Marcante now anticipates. I will not betray my programme, Marie, lest the birds of the air may whisper it to those who are interested in circumventing it. I will only reveal the part assigned to you. So soon as the bridal cortge leaves the cottage, you must hasten to the beach, and make a signal to be taken on a felucca which will lie near the shore. When there, patiently await the arrival of my bride, for she shall surely join you before the sun sinks towards the hills.<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6335-00000020"/> Then we will steer to some neighboring cove, whence we can reach the mountains without fear of pursuit. Already have I a retreat prepared for my bride, for I have feared this termination to our betrothal since Senora Marcante began to listen to the flatteries of Matra. Clarice has long been pledged to me, but for that her mother cares not. The yellow gold has jaundiced her heart, and she can see nothing but its glitter. You will not fail to accompany us, Marie?"</p> 
               <p>"No, for I love Clarice, and I owe you some kindness for past services; besides, it is not my way to forget the hand which has helped me in my own time of need. You will find me on the felucca."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, noble and true girl. I knew that you would stand by us in our need. And now for an interview with Matra, for I must see him before the morrow dawns."</p> 
               <p>"To what end?" asked Marie, in an alarmed tone. "He loves Clarice; he has all her family on his side, and he will never give her up. Why raise his suspicions as to the course you intend to pursue to-morrow?"</p> 
               <p>"It is to lull them more effectually that I seek him. He does not dream that a man of my class will risk the Vendetta. My humble craft they think is their protection, but they forget that I am mountain born; that I have trod the alpine hights as a free hunter before I tamed down my spirit to pursue my present calling, that I might gain the means which would enable me to claim my bride. Let them scorn me, till the blow is struck; I would give Matra one more chance to save his craven life. If he forces me to take it, let his blood be upon his head!"</p> 
               <p>"Blood! blood! blood!" repeated Marie, with a dreary intonation. "It is the curse of this fair land. How prosperous, how happy we might be, but for this one plague spot. The soil is desecrated by the deeds of its own children. Woe to us all that it is so."</p> 
                
               <p>"What better can you expect from such a history as ours?" asked Guilio, fiercely. "Men of indomitable will, fiery courage, and free impulses, have been for ages ground down beneath the heel of a foreign despotism. Too weak to battle with success, yet never yielding utterly beneath the pressure of circumstances, we are of that heroic Spartan mould which will fight to the death, and perish with arms in our hands, sooner than yield up the sacred cause of Freedom. From our birth we breathe the air of resistance, and in our madness we wreak upon each other the evil passions which are its inevitable product. Yes-we are a wild and lawless race, but how noble we might have become if Paoli, the great and good man, had been permitted to carry out his plans for the freedom and elevation of his countrymen. Let the fate of Corsica be what it may in the future, Marie, it is a proud thought that this little island in the sea first gave birth to the idea of constitutional freedom: that idea which has been acted on and so nobly carried out in the New World. God grant that that great people may be found worthy to preserve the priceless boon to the latest ages of time."</p> 
               <p>"Amen!" responded the singer, as she held out her hand to bid him adieu, at the point from which their paths diverged. "I shall pray earnestly for your success, Guilio; and oh! may it be gained without the sacrifice of a human life."</p> 
               <p>"I trust that your prayers may be answered; but, if blood must be spilled, I shall not hold my hand where the treasure of my heart is at stake."</p> 
               <p>The two separated-Marie to make her preparations for the voyage she had promised to undertake on the morrow, and Guilio to seek the dwelling of Matra, for a last appeal against the invasion of his rights as the betrothed of Clarice.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BARNARDO MAKES A DISCOVERY.</head> 
               <p>THE villa of Baptisto Matra lay just in the edge of the town, and its wide, orange-shaded lawn swept down towards the sea in an undulating line of beauty. It was an exquisite bijou of a house which had been erected by a man of artistic taste who had wealth at his command. After a few years of luxurious ease in the paradise his genius had created, Senor Manetti wearied of the monotony of his life, and sold the place for a tithe of its cost. Baptisto Matra became the purchaser, and he had the good taste to make no improvements of his own. The house and grounds were kept in the strictest order under the supervision of his mother, who was his housekeeper, and, until of late, his arbitrary mistress; for Senora Matra was a woman of iron will, and even at the mature age of fifty her son had not entirely emancipated himself from her control.</p> 
               <p>In a most complacent frame of mind Matra recalled the musical praises which had been lavished on him so lately; the brilliant wedding approaching so nearly, which would give to his arms the fair pearl of Isola Rossa; and he laid the flattering unction to his soul that Heaven smiled on all his plans.</p> 
               <p>As Matra approached the verandah, he was somewhat surprised to see a tall, stalwart figure seated in front of the entrance, smoking a Turkish pipe filled with perfumed tobacco. The bright moonlight streamed full upon the marked features and grizzled hair of this visitor, and the master of the mansion paused a moment to recover his self-possession before he emerged from the shadow of the orange trees that sheltered him from observation.</p> 
                
               <p>The pipe was removed from the lips of the visitor, and after a brief survey of the lawn, he impatiently muttered:</p> 
               <p>"I warned the demented old dotard that I should be here to-night, and yet he goes gallivanting after that white-faced girl who loathes him in her sight, and leaves me to cool my impatience as I may. Why does he so perseveringly seek this poor child? Matra is not a man to love with desperation, yet this marriage with a portionless and unwilling bride has been pushed on by him with a fervor that would almost make one think so. I must fathom the motive before we part; I must understand the game he is playing. <emph>My</emph> tool shall have no secrets from me, especially when I am quite ready to crush him out of my path if he annoys me."</p> 
               <p>Matra bent his ear in vain to catch the sense of these mutterings, and with a feeling of chagrin at his want of success, he strode forward, and in a voice of affected jocularity said:</p> 
               <p>"How now, Captain Barnardo, what lucky wind has wafted you here to-night? I was scarcely expecting to find so welcome a guest beneath my roof."</p> 
               <p>The captain gruffly replied:</p> 
               <p>"The business of which I warned you three weeks ago has brought me to Isola Rossa. I sent you word that I should be here at night-fall, and here I have been waiting nearly three hours for your appearance. How's this, pray? I am not used to play the lackey, even to so great a man as Senor Baptisto Matro has lately become."</p> 
               <p>"I have had no message from you. To whom was it entrusted?</p> 
               <p>"I sent it through the usual channel. Luigni Roma was the bearer."</p> 
               <p>"That explains all. Luigni lies stricken with fever in the cottage of his father, and he has been delirious since his arrival at home."</p> 
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6335-00000022"/> 
               <p>"Hm! it will be well for us both if he never recovers."</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean?" inquired Matra, nervously.</p> 
               <p>"Only that he may turn evidence against us in the affair of the Italian we--" He stopped, and made an expressive gesture towards his throat. Matra became very pale, and looked around with a terrified expression.</p> 
               <p>"For heaven's sake, Barnardo, be more cautious. If any one should be in hearing, we would be ruined. It makes my blood run cold to think of it."</p> 
               <p>"Pooh! there's nobody to play the eaves-dropper. The servants have all gone to bed ages ago, and I told your mother I would sit here and wait for you. Sit near me, and we can talk over our matters confidentially."</p> 
               <p>Matra took the seat to which he pointed, but it was with evident reluctance, and he was very careful to place himself beyond the reach of his companion's arm. Barnardo seemed to understand his motives, for a sardonic smile curled his lip, and his tones were bitterly sarcastic, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"It's too late for caution now, old fellow. My grasp is upon you, and you need not think to play me either shy or false in the game we've embarked in. Like a ninepin, such men as you can stand firm enough till the ball is bowled against them, but when that comes, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a,</foreign> scatter, plump down you fall! The ball is rolling toward you, and I shan't put out my finger to keep it back, I can tell you, unless you are on your good behavior with me."</p> 
               <p>"My good Barnardo, this is strange talk to me. I do not understand your threats. We have always been the best of friends, and I can see no cause of quarrel between us now."</p> 
               <p>"But I do, Senor, and a very grave one, too. As long as you had judgment to steer clear of womankind, I had faith in you; but now you're going to risk everything by taking a wife, a young and giddy one, too, it seems. Don't you suppose that she will soon find out you are something worse than a contrabandista? that she will blab it, as all her sex do? Then where are we, I should like to know?"</p> 
               <p>Matra looked relieved.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, if that is all, I can answer for the discretion of my betrothed. <emph>My</emph> wife will never dare to speak of what I choose to have kept secret."</p> 
               <p>"You're mighty confident of your authority, but I've known men as secure as you are, circumvented by the pestilent women to whom they trusted most. Besides, you are about to make a most unsuitable match; this young girl might be your daughter, or <foreign xml:lang="ITA">per Bacco,</foreign> your grand-daughter, for that matter; moreover, she loves another man, and of course detests you in proportion. What can induce you to stoop to pick up this poor peasant girl, is more than I can fathom."</p> 
               <p>"Have you not looked upon her, and seen that she is fairer than most women?" asked Matra, with a deprecating smile. "Men often prize beauty above station or wealth."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, but not such men as you. There is something behind all this display of disinterestedness which I must understand. What advantage to yourself do you propose to gain by this strange marriage? for I know you too well to believe that you would hamper yourself with a wife that despises you, if you didn't expect to make something by doing so."</p> 
               <p>Matra affected to laugh, but there was an expression in the stern eyes of his companion, which completely quelled him in spite of his efforts to sustain his courage. He asked:</p> 
               <p>"Why should you refuse to believe that I am so desperately enamored of this young girl, as to render me careless to worldly advantages? I am sure she is handsome enough to turn even your head."</p> 
               <p>"Stuff! <emph>my</emph> head was never made light by any such nonsense<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6335-00000023"/> sense since the verdancy of youth passed away; neither is yours. You are to gain something by this match, or you would never have pressed it on as you have. I must know your motives before we part; you know me, Baptisto; we have rowed in the same boat too long to play false to each other now. What is the secret of this affair?"</p> 
               <p>Thus pressed, Matra seemed very much embarrassed for a reply. After several moments of perturbed thought, he wiped the drops of excitement from his forehead, and in a hoarse whisper, said:</p> 
               <p>"Suppose the girl isn't what she seems? That she is in reality more than my equal? What would you say to my choice then?"</p> 
               <p>"Hum-I hardly know; but I am in the darkness yet. Speak to the point, if you please. Who and what is she, if she is not really the child of Bianca Marcante?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe-nay, I am certain that she is a person of far more importance than the child of the shrewd old peasant woman."</p> 
               <p>He paused, and Barnardo impatiently said:</p> 
               <p>"Then who, in the fiend's name, is she? What is this mystery, and how have <emph>you</emph> discovered it?"</p> 
               <p>"It is simple enough. Do you remember the papers of the Italian who was sent on his long journey by us? They fell into my hands, while you preferred appropriating the greater portion of the gold he had with him. I looked over these papers, and they gave the clue to a most singular piece of family history. Barnardo, what I am about to confide to you, will be held as secret as our other transactions are?"</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly, yes; honor among thieves has passed into a proverb, and it is not my intention to violate its faith. Whatever I may think of the use you have made of the information you have gained, I shall certainly not betray you; so now out with it, man."</p> 
                
               <p>Matra drew near to him, and, in a guarded tone, went on:</p> 
               <p>"On looking over the papers, I was as much surprised as any one could be to find that the man we had done for, was the agent of a wealthy nobleman in Sardinia, sent hither to trace a woman and child, who were supposed to have taken refuge near Isola Rossa more than seventeen years ago."</p> 
               <p>The listener uttered an exclamation very like a groan, and his pipe-stem was suddenly crushed between his teeth. He bent his head forward in breathless interest, but he said nothing.</p> 
               <p>Matra went on:</p> 
               <p>"This lady was the wife of a man of rank, but she lived unhappily with him, and after a scene of violence between them, she took her sleeping child in her arms, and with a considerable sum of money concealed about her person, in the silence of the night she left her home. Her evasion was so complete that no trace of her could for years be obtained.</p> 
               <p>"After anxious search for some clue to her place of concealment, her husband at length discovered that she was landed at Cape Corso; thence she probably made her way to Isola Rossa. The Italian was sent hither to ascertain if either mother or child are yet living, as the latter has inherited a large property, which can only be claimed after she becomes the acknowledged heiress of her father's name and honors."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo forced himself to ask:</p> 
               <p>"And what has this romance to do with the daughter of Senora Marcante?"</p> 
               <p>"Everything, as I will soon show you. I can remember all that has happened in this town for the last thirty years, and I instantly recalled the delicate woman who found shelter with the Marcantes at the very time referred to, for I<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6335-00000024"/> was sometimes at their cottage in those days, and I have often marvelled at the resemblance the peasant woman's child bore to the fair stranger. I have for years had my suspicions that the living child of the Italian lady was passed off as the daughter of her hostess. I do not know why this was done, but that such an exchange was accomplished I have long been convinced; and I kept a sharp eye on Senora Marcante in consequence of it."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo laughed hoarsely; he rudely said:</p> 
               <p>"Stuff! I don't believe in such an exchange at all. The girl has been reared here, and never before has a doubt of her parentage been expressed. What further proof have you to support your absurd idea?"</p> 
               <p>"One that seems incontrovertible to me: While a little half-clad child, I have often remarked a singular birth-mark upon the breast of Clarice; there are three red streaks, in the shape of a cross, clearly defined upon her flesh. This mark, I learned from the papers, is an heirloom in the family to which she belongs. Thus, you see, the evidence that this girl is really the high-born heiress who is sought for is clear to my mind."</p> 
               <p>Some powerful emotion seemed to be struggling in the mind of the listener, but he conquered it, and steadily said:</p> 
               <p>"And the man we robbed and murdered was sent hither to seek and identify her? It was an evil chance which caused that casket to fall into your hands, Baptisto."</p> 
               <p>"Why so, pray?"</p> 
               <p>"Because it suggested to you a piece of villainy which will be likely to cost you dearly in the end. Do you suppose that this beautiful young girl will remain with you an hour after she ascertains her true position? that her family will permit her to fill the station of <emph>your</emph> wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not," replied Matra coolly; "but she will at least be mine as long as I shall be likely to care for her, and her relatives must pay me nobly to be rid of me. Half her fortune will only release Clarice from the bonds the priest will forge to-morrow. I care very little for the girl. Her lover might have taken her and welcome, but for this discovery."</p> 
               <p>"If that is the case, why not release the girl on the same terms, without asking the services of the priest? Clarice would gladly relinquish the chances of fortune, to escape from the marriage in which her reputed mother is forcing her."</p> 
               <p>Baptisto slowly shook his head:</p> 
               <p>"No-that would not answer at all. She is too young to be bound by any contract she might make, and those to whom she belongs are too powerful to heed it, if it did not suit them to do so. My only safeguard is to make her my wife, and then the terms of separation will be of my own dictation. The freedom from a misalliance will be purchased at any price I may choose to set upon it."</p> 
               <p>"Hum-there is something in that. But you have not told me yet to what family she belongs. I suppose you ascertained that?"</p> 
               <p>"That I have yet to find out, for the name of her family was carefully avoided. A strange cipher was used to indicate them throughout the papers; but I have sent an agent to Italy to make such inquiries as must soon develop something satisfactory."</p> 
               <p>"So-o-after all, you are venturing in the dark on such a move in the game of life as this will be. The supposed heiress may turn out to be worth no more than if she had really been Senora Marcante's child. I think you risk too much, if your heart is not concerned in this affair."</p> 
               <p>Matra looked confused, and after a pause, he said:</p> 
               <p>"The girl is really as beautiful as the pictures of the Madonna<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6335-00000025"/> donna, and I have a taste for beauty, as you know of old. Besides, I have a grudge against this young Falcone, and it pleases me to wrest her from him. They have long loved each other, and it is striking him upon the heart to lay her hand in mine as my wedded bride."</p> 
               <p>"And what of <emph>her?</emph>" asked Barnardo, significantly. "It is a poor preparation for matrimonial felicity to bring a shrinking wife to preside over your household. If what I have heard of this young girl be true, she has that fire and spirit which will not render her a tame captive to your will."</p> 
               <p>"Then she can go from me. I shall tire of her pretty face in a month, and the bribe to give her up shall repay me for my brief sacrifice of freedom."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo made a gesture of impatience. He arose and said:</p> 
               <p>"Come, show me the papers which have given you this imaginary fortune. I may see less in them than you seem to have found, for, by the mass! I have little faith in this sudden elevation of little Clarice to the dignity of family and fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Go with me to my room, and I will show you what will convince you that my actions have been warranted by facts."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo discarded his pipe, and followed his host into a lighted room fitted up with much elegance. He looked around him with a strange gleam in his eyes, as he drily said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah-h, I remember much of this plenishing. But if your destined bride could only know as well as I do the history of many of these articles of luxury and beauty, she would be less than woman if she did not close her eyes in horror upon them. Ah, here is the jewel-casket which the Neapolitan lady held to her heart till death loosed her grasp, and here--"</p> 
                
               <p>Matra threw up his hand in a paroxysm of fright, as he hoarsely exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, Barnardo, cease such talk. Other ears than mine may hear your words. I am only known as Matra, the rich trader, and you are the captain of one of my vessels. Why should you speak in this reckless manner because you are offended with me? I am willing to do all in my power to satisfy you, but you are in so strange a mood to-night that I scarcely know how to take you."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo threw himself into a luxurious <foreign xml:lang="FRA">futeuil,</foreign> and after a painful pause, replied:</p> 
               <p>"Have I not good cause to be in a bad humor? We are banded together as comrades for good or for evil, and you are about to take to your home a Delilah, whose craft will discover your secret occupation, and whose hatred to you will lead her to proclaim it to the world. Content yourself with your legitimate gains, and let this girl, and her possible fortune, go to whoever wants them. They will only prove a snare to you."</p> 
               <p>"That will I never do," said Matra, with more appearance of spirit than he had yet shown. "If you were seriously opposed to the marriage, you should have spoken before this time. It is too late now, for my pride would never brook a disappointment after the publicity that has been given by my preparations for a grand bridal. Here are the papers. Examine them at your leisure, while I smoke my pipe."</p> 
               <p>He took from a cabinet a box banded with steel, and secured by a strong lock. On opening it, a sheet of paper closely written appeared, but it bore no address. On the envelope was a laurel wreath drawn with a pen, enclosing a cipher through which a dart was passed.</p> 
               <p>An expression of intense yet painful interest passed over<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6335-00000026"/> the features of Barnardo as his eyes fell upon this symbol, and he hurriedly grasped the parcel and opened it.</p> 
               <p>The directions to the agent were written in Italian, but they were expressed in so terse and guarded a manner that nothing more could be learned from them than Matra had already revealed. The man who had been dispatched to Corsica to discover traces of a runaway wife, had taken passage upon the felucca commanded by Barnardo. Its character was unsuspected by him, and to secure the money it was discovered he had with him, the captain, aided by Matra, who happened to be on board himself, dispatched him, threw him into the sea, and took possession of his effects.</p> 
               <p>Thus the temptation to a new crime fell into the hands of Baptisto, of which he was not slow to avail himself. The papers in the possession of the murdered man Barnardo had not considered of any importance; now, he felt with bitterness that he had suffered a secret to pass into the keeping of Matra which was one of vital importance to himself. He reflected silently, and made up his mind as to the course he would pursue. His own carelessness had given Matra this advantage, then why should he seek to balk him of his prize? Let him drain the golden Pactolus, but he would take good care that the greater portion of his gains should at last enrich himself.</p> 
               <p>At length he raised his head and spoke:</p> 
               <p>"I can enlighten you as to what this means," and he pointed toward the laurel wreath and cipher.</p> 
               <p>Matra eagerly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Can you indeed do so, my good Barnardo?"</p> 
               <p>"I have been much in Italy, as you already know, and I am acquainted with the secret device of more than one noble family. These laurel leaves surrounding this cipher point out to me unerringly their haughty owner, who is no less a personage than Rinaldi Ernesti, senator and count, once the owner of a fair inheritance, now living in his castle near Genoa, from lack of means to keep up his ancestral state in the capital. If Clarice is <emph>his</emph> daughter, your dream of wealth from her will prove as baseless as most dreams are."</p> 
               <p>Matra looked shrewd.</p> 
               <p>"You forget an important part of my communication. The daughter has inherited a patrimony which renders it important to her father to reclaim her, hence his anxiety to do so."</p> 
               <p>"True; explain, if you please, that I may thoroughly understand the position of this young girl."</p> 
               <p>"The father made a plebeian alliance which turned out unhappily-his wife forsook him, and concealed their child from his knowledge. One of her brothers became a wealthy trader, and the fortune he amassed is to centre in this girl, provided she is acknowledged by her father as the heiress to his name and honors. This much I have known from the beginning, but I could find no clue to the family I am ambitious to enter. Are you <emph>sure</emph> that it is the Ernesti?"</p> 
               <p>Barnardo surveyed the crest with bitter meaning as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have good cause to remember that symbol, but it is a matter of bygone days, and I shall not consider it necessary to explain how or whence I obtained my certainty. Suffice it to you that this young girl is Countess Ernesti in her own right, and, as you say, the heiress to wealth. Once made aware of her existence, her friends will take her from you, even if she is your wife; but that is your affair, not mine. If you can salve your broken heart with a golden plaster, all will be settled to your satisfaction, no doubt."</p> 
               <p>"That can I do easily enough," replied Matra, with irrepressible exultation. "It is a novel scheme for making ducats, but it will pay-it will pay nobly. At one blow I<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6335-00000027"/> increase my own fortune, and gratify my grudge against Guilio Falcone. Yes-yes, I will bring down this highborn maiden to the level of me and mine."</p> 
               <p>The captain regarded him disdainfully.</p> 
               <p>"Be sure of one thing, Baptisto, get quit of her before she has a chance to find out what will elevate you rather higher than many of us care to go."</p> 
               <p>Matra winced at this sneer, but he carelessly replied:</p> 
               <p>"You can rely on me to take good care of our <emph>common</emph> welfare, for you are in the same boat that bears me on to safety or punishment. I am no fool where self-interest is at stake."</p> 
               <p>"That's true enough; but I am tired now, and must rest a few hours before I seek my bark again. My usual den is ready to receive me again, I suppose."</p> 
               <p>"There is always a place for you under my roof. But you will stay to my wedding?"</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me. I do not care to see the pearl of Isola Rossa cast before the beast of which the priest tells us. I shall leave before the ceremony comes off."</p> 
               <p>Matra made an ineffectual effort to smile at this taunt, but there was an ominous gleam in his deep black eyes, and his fingers worked nervously, as if ready to clutch the knife he wore concealed upon his person; he coolly said:</p> 
               <p>"Swinish as <emph>you</emph> may think me, there is not another girl in Isola Rossa who would not have been glad of the chance to become Madame Matra."</p> 
               <p>"Which only proves that they are a most tasteless and venal set of creatures. There-good night; I have said all I mean to say, and I must rest-rest-rest."</p> 
               <p>"Very well; but not in your usual room-now that it is fitted up for my bride's dressing-closet. Come into the other wing-a place for guests has been provided there."</p> 
               <p>He took up a lamp, and led the way into a small apartment ment containing only a bed and a single chair. The seaman threw off his coat, and without further ceremony stretched himself upon the hard couch, grumbling as he did so:</p> 
               <p>"It's just as I thought it would be. When a man thinks of marrying, his heart and home narrow toward his old friends, as this place proves. See how mean it is, how inferior to the accommodations I have hitherto claimed in this house. But it is good enough, I suppose, for a rough old customer like me."</p> 
               <p>"How could I know that you would come here just at this time?" asked Matra, in a deprecating tone. "If you had warned me in time, I would have done better for you, but when a man is on the eve of marriage he must get things ready for his bride, even if his visitors are incommoded a little."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, oh yes-I am not unreasonable. Only leave me to sleep now, for I have work to do to-morrow,-work that must be thought on beforehand."</p> 
               <p>"Good night, then, and success attend your labors, say I, for your industry fills my coffers as well as your own."</p> 
               <p>He closed the door as he went out, and Barnardo spoke through his set teeth as he lazily turned himself upon his couch.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps the work in hand may have a contrary effect, my worthy friend. Wealth, wife, home for you; while risk, hardship, and scant courtsey are my share of the venture. The balance must be more evenly struck, or I give up the pirate craft, and with it the <emph>respectable</emph> history of the successful Matra.</p> 
               <p>"The husband of a countess-indeed! of a daughter of that race of strong will and fiery courage: faugh! I trust the bride will prove her lineage by thrusting a dagger in his heart as he stands beside her at the altar.</p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6335-00000028"/> 
               <p>"What? is it true? Can it be that the child of her I pursued and ruined by my mad passion has grown to womanhood in a peasant's cottage? How could I be so blind as not to know her the instant my eyes fell upon her! Oh, mine has been a wild, sad fate, but my baseness toward that helpless woman is the darkest spot in its wretched history.</p> 
               <p>"Lawless crime, bold adventure, are nothing to falsehood that stabbed in the dark-that crushed a feeble creature, because I had the power to arouse the suspicions of a weak nature.</p> 
               <p>"What atonement can I now make? Shall I snatch the girl from her vampyre bridegroom? 'Tis too late for that, I fear; yes, the marriage must go on, yet I wish I could prevent it. Strange! Hardened as I am, I cannot bear the thought that this low-born churl shall claim Ginevra's child as <emph>his</emph> bride, even for an hour. Blind fool! why did I not examine those papers myself, then Matra had not obtained this advantage over me."</p> 
               <p>He arose and walked to and fro in the narrow room in a a state of irrepressible excitement. Plan after plan occurred to him, and finally he sat down to mature that which seemed most feasible to him. He could not rest, for phantoms from the long-buried past came flitting around him, and they effectually murdered sleep. Matra would have shivered and grown pale, could he have fathomed the ruthless intent with which his guest finally laid down, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"That will wipe out all, and settle old scores. Falcone shall bear the blame, and I will go free. I will possess myself of those papers, seek <emph>him,</emph> and restore Ginevra's child to her birthright. That will be atonement for the wrong I inflicted in those years of passion and crime. Ah! have they been followed by anything better? worse-even worse. Darker and more infamous have my days become as they have lengthened out."</p> 
                
               <p>And, in a momentary paroxysm of repentance, Barnardo bent his head upon his arms, and reviewed all the wretched and irrevocable past; yet his meditations ended in a fixed resolution to add yet another crime to the dark catalogue already recorded against him.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A TERRIBLE COMPACT.</head> 
               <p>IN the meantime, Matra walked the verandah, with his thoughts divided between exultation at the near approach of the marriage which was to secure such brilliant advantages to himself, and the vague fear which had entered his soul that, in spite of the apparent concurrence of Barnardo in his views of self-aggrandizement, he might yet attempt to circumvent them; for no one better understood the violent and unprincipled nature of his colleague in crime.</p> 
               <p>From his unscrupulous daring, Matra had hitherto reaped a golden harvest; but he knew perfectly well that a feather's weight might turn this bold bad man into a relentless enemy, and the glittering edifice of prosperity he had so successfully reared, would thus come toppling down, crushing him beneath its ruins.</p> 
               <p>Thus reflecting, Matra ground his teeth in impotent rage, and fingered the handle of his knife with the vaguely formed intent to enter Barnardo's room as he slept, and stab him to the heart.</p> 
               <p>The temptation no sooner assailed him than it became irresistible, and three times he crept to the door of the chamber occupied by his fearful guest; each time to hear him moving within, and to curse him in his heart because<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6335-00000029"/> he would not lie down and seek that repose which it was his purpose to render eternal.</p> 
               <p>Matra was returning from one of these expeditions, when a door was suddenly unclosed, and the dark gipsy-looking head of an old woman was thrust through the opening.</p> 
               <p>"Who walks the house at this late hour?" asked a harsh voice.</p> 
               <p>"It is I, mother. I cannot sleep-I have not yet been in bed."</p> 
               <p>"Neither have I, my son. Come in, for I would speak with you."</p> 
               <p>Matra entered a spacious chamber in which a light was still burning. The furniture of this room afforded a striking contrast to that which was found in the remainder of the house. It contained only the common articles in use in the houses of the poorest peasants, and they all had an ancient, well-worn appearance. The light fell upon a tall, spare form, wrapped in the black faldetta worn by the women of Corsica, and its sombre hue seemed to give additional expression to the dark features and gleaming eyes of the wearer.</p> 
               <p>Those eyes were deep set, and black as night, absorbing every ray of light that fell upon them, and emitting only flashes of scathing fire when the passions of their owner were aroused. A true Corsican, the soul of this woman was iron, and her blood was like seething lava when any fancied or real wrong assailed her. Her features were sharply and clearly cut, and the firmly set mouth, with its thin lips, showed that a resolution once taken was never departed from.</p> 
               <p>That face, when deformed by passion, might have belonged to one of the furies, and rarely did it wear a soft or womanly expression. She drew Matra far into the room and stood so long silent that he ventured to ask:</p> 
                
               <p>"What do you wish to say to me, mother?"</p> 
               <p>Though the nominal master of the house, he had for years stood in as great dread of this imperious woman as the very menials under her control. He had never dared to oppose her wishes until the question of his marriage arose; then the importance of the interests at stake gave him courage to act without her approbation, for she resented the thought of a young wife in the home she had so long ruled over.</p> 
               <p>In reply to his question Senora Matra impressively said:</p> 
               <p>"I have been alone for many hours, and as I sat on yonder seat, I had a vision which concerns you. I have called you hither to warn you-oh! my son, my son!"</p> 
               <p>"A vision, mother? Tush! you have slept, and dreamed of me."</p> 
               <p>"No," she impressively replied. "I have not slept; at times it seems to me that I shall never sleep again, for the scene of blood that rises before me murders sleep. Oh, Baptisto, this marriage is accursed, and it will bring only evil to you-only evil!"</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, mother! Because you do not like Clarice, you bring every objection that can be thought of against my marriage with her. I have reasoned with you in vain, and now I must frankly tell you that I <emph>will</emph> not give up this match. I do not often oppose you, but when my will is once fairly set against yours, you see that it will carry the day."</p> 
               <p>She wrung her hands wildly as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I feel that-I know it; but this disobedience will cost you all that is dear to you-all, all. Hearken to my warning, and be saved in time; I sat upon my chair, and a scene of violence arose before me. The fair temptress who is to be your fate was torn from your side, and you fell bathed in your own blood. A voice spoke to me, and I heard it distinctly<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6335-00000030"/> tinctly say: 'This girl is no fitting mate for a son of yours; he must give her up, or dire ruin will come to him.' It was the voice of Fate, Baptisto, and must not be disregarded."</p> 
               <p>Her burning eyes were fixed upon him with an eager, questioning glance; but he sneered as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"Madam, when I have spoken of marriage you have ever opposed me; twice before this you have had ominous visions when I thought of bringing a wife into my house. The trick has become stale; I listened to you, and gave up my hopes of wedded happiness in youth and in early manhood; now, I am fully matured, and capable of judging for myself; I have too much at stake to be moved from my purpose. Clarice becomes my wife to-morrow; that is my irrevocable determination."</p> 
               <p>"And your old mother must be driven to the wall to make way for a young bride!" she scornfully said. "Look at my room, and then go into those prepared for her reception. If the peasant girl were a princess, greater pains could scarcely have been taken to set her out daintily."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, it has been your whim to surround yourself with the memorials of other days. You can have whatever you choose to order, for I have the means of paying for the most expensive things. It is my will to prepare what is handsome for my bride, and no one in this house, not even you, shall gainsay me."</p> 
               <p>The old woman looked into his heavy face, and saw there the expression of dogged obstinacy familiar to her from his boyhood, and she felt that the sceptre had departed from her. She bitterly said:</p> 
               <p>"You refuse, then, to hearken to my warning? You believe it to be but a figment of my own brain; well-perhaps it is, but there is prophecy in my blood, as events of bygone years should have taught you. Spurn my counsels, laugh my visions to scorn, but the end will come.</p> 
                
               <p>I must remain here till after to-morrow; then, if the dream of blood is not fulfilled, I will seek another home. The hut in which you first saw the light will be a more welcome shelter to me than the roof which bends over my rival in your heart and house. Let the young bride come as a living curse to the elderly dotard that takes her to his heart. Why should I care if it be so? My day is past, and the night speedily cometh."</p> 
               <p>Matra still listened unmoved. He was weary of the thraldom in which he had been so long held, and was glad to have it ended on any terms. He coldly said:</p> 
               <p>"You must act as you choose, but there is no need that you should return to the old ruin by the sea. There is a cottage on the hill side which belongs to me; you can retire to that after my marriage; perhaps it will be best for us all that you and Clarice should not attempt to live in the same house."</p> 
               <p>A lightning flash was emitted from the eyes that rested on him, and the iron lips assumed their most defiant expression. She spoke with cold precision.</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless-doubtless such is your opinion, but who is to take care of what is provided for the house? Who is to prevent you from being ruined by the waste that will ensue if I leave the management of your affairs. Do you suppose that white-faced chit knows anything about house-keeping? Her head is only filled with vanity and folly, as you will soon find to your cost. Oh, yes, send the poor old mother away by all means, and you will soon see what will come of it."</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I only acceded to your own proposal; if you intend to stay here, say so, in the fiend's name," replied Matra, goaded beyond endurance by her taunting tones. "Let me tell you a secret. I only take Clarice on <emph>speculation,</emph> as I would do with any other piece of property that promised a<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6335-00000031"/> good per centage. Stay here or go away, as seems best to you, but I do not believe she will trouble you long by her presence in my house."</p> 
               <p>The old woman regarded him searchingly, and she slowly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What do you mean? How can this penniless girl become the source of fortune to you?"</p> 
               <p>"That is my secret. Clarice will have money-money which I will clutch and use for my own benefit, while she may go adrift if she refuses to pay the respect due to the mother of her husband."</p> 
               <p>"Ah-h, is it so, indeed? Then my suspicions are correct! I have often marvelled how Bianca Marcante should have a daughter so fair and delicate in her looks as this young girl. It was <emph>her</emph> infant that was buried with the foreign woman, and Clarice is the Italian's child. How did you find it out, Baptisto? and why was such an exchange made?"</p> 
               <p>"Pooh! you jump to conclusions too quickly, Madam. I did not mean to say that such an exchange was made. It may be my own fancy after all."</p> 
               <p>His mother disdainfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I will have no half confidence. Tell me all you know of this girl's origin, or I will seek her, and tell her what you have betrayed; she will then refuse to become your wife, and I should be glad to break the match even on those terms, for my soul is darkened with fears as to its results to yourself. However fair may be the promise of this marriage, it will bring dire repentance to you, I feel assured."</p> 
               <p>Matra listened with a vague feeling of fear, for his mother had infused all the superstitions of his country into his mind, and he fully believed in the prophetic power she claimed for herself. At that moment a lugubrious cry was heard, and the discordant wail of an owl swept through the air.</p> 
               <p>"There!" exclaimed the old woman. "That baleful cry comes as the warning echo to my words. Listen, and beware!"</p> 
               <p>Matra shuddered, and spoke in a subdued tone:</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I will tell you all, and then you shall decide as to my future course. I will yield to your judgment in this affair, for I begin to feel that it will be better than mine."</p> 
               <p>Thus ever ended the contests between the imperious mother and rebellious son, and a grim smile of superiority flitted over her lips as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"That is well; now unravel this mystery to me."</p> 
               <p>In as few words as possible, Matra told all he knew, or suspected, of the origin of Clarice, and placed before his mother the proofs of her claim to a large inheritance. She listened in silent astonishment to the revelation, and as he proceeded, her innate reverence for station and fortune overcame even her antipathy to the idea of a young wife in the house. She forgot or repressed her forebodings of evil, and she eagerly said:</p> 
               <p>"Countess Ernesti in her own right, with lands and gold as her dower? Are you sure-quite <emph>sure?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"As sure as I can be of anything."</p> 
               <p>"Then of course you must marry her. Matters have gone too far to withdraw now, and I take back my objections. Bring hither your high-born bride, and I will do all that is in my power to make her contented in her new home. Oh, this is a very different thing to giving your hand to a poor peasant girl. You can claim the title and become a count yourself. Ha! that would be grand for your father's son."</p> 
               <p>Matra shook his head.</p> 
               <p>"I have no hope of that. I only expect to win gold by this marriage; beyond that my ambition does not soar."</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6335-00000032"/> 
               <p>"Then you are a baser fool than <emph>my</emph> son should be," replied the bitter, taunting voice which had goaded him on throughout his whole life. "Why should you not be Count Ernesti, if you become the husband of the heiress? It will be your right, and any but a craven spirit would claim and enforce it."</p> 
               <p>"Let us not discuss that now, mother. The night is passing away, and we must both gain a few hours repose before the important to-morrow comes. Retire to bed, and dream of my future greatness."</p> 
               <p>"Good night, then, my son. See how much better it would have been to take me into your confidence from the first. It would have spared me many hours of bitterness. I now understand your course and approve it; bring your noble bride hither, and I will seek to make her home happy for her."</p> 
               <p>"And the vision of blood, mother? What becomes of that?"</p> 
               <p>The woman shuddered, for she had faith in her own previsions, and she reluctantly said:</p> 
               <p>"The red cloud was certainly over me to-night. Blood-blood will be spilled, but it cannot be yours, my son, for your fortunes are at their culminating point. Good luck is with you, and its prestige will not desert you at a moment's warning. I will close my eyes, and ask of the Fates once more; their answer may be less ominous of doom than the one I fancied I had received to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Better close them in sleep, mother, and suffer your diseased fancies to rest in the oblivion best suited to them."</p> 
               <p>Matra left the apartment, and the stern, hard old woman threw herself upon a seat, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"A countess, truly a countess, with lands and gold. Who would have thought it? and I, with all my foreknowledge, could not tell it. I must have lost my power, and the bloody phantom was only a sham."</p> 
                
               <p>Among her associates Senora Matra had the reputation of being a witch and a vampire, for the common people of Corsica believe in the existence of both, and they confidently assert that to such creatures belongs the power to transform themselves at will, and assume the form of a beautiful virgin or of a cat. To protect themselves from the power of such mischievous persons, the peasantry wear relics or amulets, and as Matra went out his mother remembered that one of these, was in her own possession.</p> 
               <p>Wishing to guard him in every possible manner from the danger she apprehended for him, she sought it with eager haste, and with a grim smile took from a drawer a small, square stone, with yellow scales like iron rust imbedded in it. After muttering a few words over this, she followed Matra, and stumbled over him in the obscurity of the hall, prowling near the door of his guest.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you watch here?" she asked.</p> 
               <p>"I merely wished to see if Barnardo sleeps yet," he replied, with difficulty repressing the execration that arose to his lips.</p> 
               <p>The door was suddenly opened, and the light of the lamp within the room streamed upon them. Barnardo, with a short laugh, said:</p> 
               <p>"By Bacchus, we all keep late hours to-night. Pray what brings you to my door, my friends? Is it customary with you to set a watch upon the sojourner beneath your roof?"</p> 
               <p>"By no means," said Matra, in some confusion. "I have only been to visit my mother, and she followed me to say a few words more, I presume. What is it that you seek, Madame? Let Barnardo hear that he may not unjustly suspect me of spying upon him."</p> 
               <p>"That would be far from the truth; you will think me very foolish, I dare say, my good Barnardo, but I came out to place this charm around my Baptisto's neck. It will<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6335-00000033"/> protect him from evil, and I have had heavy fears for him of late."</p> 
               <p>"Why should you be so foolish, Senora? for everything goes well with your fortunate son. Give <emph>me</emph> the charm, for I am one of the reckless sort who need its protection sadly."</p> 
               <p>He held out his hand as if to take the stone, but the old woman tenaciously grasped it.</p> 
               <p>"No, no-this came from Seneca's tower, and it has been blessed by the holy father with a purification in holy water. Its virtues are beyond price, and it must lie upon the breast of my son as a safeguard against evil. Here, Matra, let me place it beneath your vest, where you may wear it safe and unsuspected. My heart will be easier when I know you have it about you."</p> 
               <p>"It is nonsense; but if you will be happier I cannot refuse you," said Matra, as he held his head to permit the cord attached to the charm to be passed over it.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo laughed mockingly:</p> 
               <p>"Will that scrap of stone render him bullet proof, old lady? It is a very simple thing to possess such power, and if you own another talisman, I shall be glad to claim its protection myself, for I lead a reckless sort of life, and often need something of the kind. I have been to Seneca's tower on the sea-shore, and I had no idea the stones the old sage walked over possess such virtue, or I would have gathered up quite a collection of them. With the blessing of the church, I suppose any of them would be as good as this one."</p> 
               <p>The woman dubiously replied.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps they might: but this has been to Rome, and the Pope himself blessed it."</p> 
               <p>"Then place it on Matra's breast by all means, for he will need its influence in his new career as the respectable head of a family. If it teaches him to be true to his comrades, it will keep him out of danger of being turned on and crushed before he can lift his hand to defend himself."</p> 
               <p>There was such a depth of savage meaning in the tones of the speaker, that Matra's cowardly soul shrank and quivered within him. He said, in a deprecating manner:</p> 
               <p>"You suspect me of evil intent toward you, Barnardo; but I swear to you that I have told you the truth as to the cause of my presence on this spot. Sleep in peace and safety, man, for I am no midnight assassin, nor would I stain my hand with blood on the eve of my marriage."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo disdainfully regarded him. He suddenly turned on his heel and closed the door. As the mother and son were hastily retreating he again opened it, and spoke:</p> 
               <p>"The door has no fastening, as you well knew when you placed me here; but that matters not. I sleep with my hand upon my carbine, and the lightest step arouses me. Look to it, friend Baptisto, for I will not again be interrupted with impunity."</p> 
               <p>Muttering curses upon him, Matra sought his own apartment, and threw himself upon his bed; but vainly did he court sleep. His mind was filled with schemes of aggrandizement, in which but one idea held a prominent place-the acquisition of gold, the sole idol of his mean nature. The wrong he was ready to inflict on the helpless girl he was about to make his wife, did not for a moment weigh against the advantages that must result to himself from the brief union to which he looked forward. By fastening such bonds upon Clarice, he gained the certainty of a large sum to release her from his power, and in his mean and sordid soul, he exulted in the thought that the refined and lovely daughter of a noble house would belong to him; that he could crush her spirit, and humble her soul to the dust,<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6335-00000034"/> before he gave her back the freedom for which so heavy a price should be exacted.</p> 
               <p>At length he slept, but in a light and perturbed manner, for the warning of his mother, and the scowling aspect of Barnardo, had filled his mind with vague fears which he could not reason away. A pale phantom seemed to swoop down, and clutch him in its suffocating grasp; and after a violent struggle, he awoke to find the hand of a man laid upon his breast. His first thought was that Barnardo had come to take his life, and he prepared for a death struggle, in which he felt that one or the other must perish.</p> 
               <p>To his infinite relief the voice which spoke to him in guarded tones was not that of the captain:</p> 
               <p>"Hist! Matra! awake, and make no noise, for I must speak with you. I shall do you no harm, but you must hearken to what I have to say."</p> 
               <p>Matra aroused himself and sat up on the bed. The moon-light streamed into the open window, revealing the means of ingress found by the visitor. In his perturbation he did not recognize the voice of the speaker, and he gruffly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Who are you? and how have you dared to enter my house in this manner?"</p> 
               <p>"I am Guilio Falcone, and I seek justice at your hands," replied the visitor.</p> 
               <p>"In what have I wronged you, pray? We have nothing in common, and I desire to have nothing to say to you."</p> 
               <p>"Yet I was the betrothed of Clarice Marcante before you sought her, and I have come hither to warn you that it will be best for you to resign her to me."</p> 
               <p>"And if I refuse, what then?"</p> 
               <p>"Judge for yourself; I am a Corsican."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! dare you threaten me with violence?"</p> 
               <p>"I use no threats. You are too mean and cowardly to be warred on by me. I do not seek your blood; but I will not quietly submit to have the idol of my life cast into the arms of one who will make her miserable. Clarice loves <emph>me;</emph> why, then, do you seek to carry out your selfish views in making her your wife?"</p> 
               <p>"Upon my word, you have enough vanity and impudence for a legion. The captain of a fishing craft proclaims himself <emph>my</emph> rival, and demands of me the relinquishment of my betrothed bride! Is there anything else in which I can accommodate you, my humble friend? Will you also have a dower bestowed on her you so gallantly claim?"</p> 
               <p>"Money gained as yours has been I would not accept, even if the offer were made in earnest. I possess a clue to your true character, Baptisto Matra, and I advise you to weigh my demand well before you refuse it."</p> 
               <p>The listener quailed before this threat, but he calmly said:</p> 
               <p>"My true character is that of an honest and peaceful trader, as every man and woman in Isola Rossa knows. I can defy you there; and I will take such precautions in the morning as will defeat any plan you may lay to snatch my bride from me. There-you have your answer; and now leave my house, before I have you arrested for entering it like a burglar. Should I do so, how could you prove that your object was not to plunder, perhaps to murder me?"</p> 
               <p>"I could not only prove that, but <emph>so much more</emph> which would affect the honorable station you claim, that I would not advise you to make the attempt. Luigni Roma is dead; I was with him in his last hours, and heard from him some important facts in which you are deeply interested. The character of the Violante and her commander are known to me, and I am in possession of such proofs of the nefarious traffic you have carried on for years as must crush you at once, if they are produced."</p> 
               <p>The heart of the listener stood still, and the cold dew of<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6335-00000035"/> fear burst forth upon his brow. His soul fainted within him before the magnitude of the danger that threatened him, and he faltered:</p> 
               <p>"Who and what are <emph>you,</emph> that your charges against me should be listened to? You have come hither to obtain, by falsehood and threats, what you could not gain by fair means."</p> 
               <p>"Not so, Matra. Accident enabled me to serve Luigni, and thus Providence has placed in my hands the means of rescuing the girl I love from the wretched fate you would give her. Relinquish all claim to Clarice, and your secret is safe with me."</p> 
               <p>"But I, too, love this girl."</p> 
               <p>"And she loves <emph>me.</emph> A man worthy of the name will not take as his wife a woman who would sooner embrace death than become his. If your plans for to-morrow could be carried out, the bride you would force to the altar would be found slain by her own hand, before she could be installed as the mistress of your household. I speak calmly, though I know that I speak truly."</p> 
               <p>"What proof have I that your assertions are not false? That you are not seeking to impose on my credulity, that you may gain your own ends without danger to yourself?"</p> 
               <p>Falcone whispered a few words in his ear, and Matra reeled as if about to faint, but he struggled to regain the mastery of himself, and after a pause, said:</p> 
               <p>"You know too much to be defied. But what will the people of the town say, if I give up my bride without a struggle?"</p> 
               <p>"There can be an apparent struggle, in which it will be your business to make sure that I and my party shall come off conquerors. All the forms of a Corsican marriage are to be carried out, I understand, and I can easily seize the bride and bear her away, while your friends shall believe that you would have kept her, if you could have done so."</p> 
                
               <p>"Let it be so; you have outwitted me," said Matra, with reluctance. "But you must swear upon the cross that if Clarice becomes yours, you will never betray the dying revelations of Luigni."</p> 
               <p>"I swear it," and Falcone drew from his breast a crucifix of carved ebony, which he devoutly pressed to his lips.</p> 
               <p>"It is well thus far, and now for the morrow. How do you propose to carry out your purpose?"</p> 
               <p>"A wise strategist never betrays his plans, especially to the enemy," replied Guilio, with calm decision. "Go on your way to the bridal, and leave me to swoop down like my namesake, and snatch my white dove to my breast."</p> 
               <p>"But-but, shall I be quite safe from harm?"</p> 
               <p>A disdainful smile curled the lip of the youth:</p> 
               <p>"I have already assured you that I seek not your blood. You know something of my past life, and you also know that the captain of the fishing-smack stands fair with men as one whose word is to be trusted."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I am aware of that; but answer me one question. Are you the sole possessor of my secret?"</p> 
               <p>"I alone heard Luigni's confession. When the priest came to him he was speechless, and scarcely conscious of the last rites of the church."</p> 
               <p>A sinister smile crept to the lips of Baptisto, and he quickly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is well. Make your arrangements to seize your coveted bride, and leave me in security. It will be a good exchange for me, for my mother is opposed to the entrance of a young wife into the house she has so long ruled; and where women disagree there cannot be much peace."</p> 
               <p>"You then pledge yourself to make no resistance to my attempt to carry Clarice off?"</p> 
               <p>"I do; and now let us part. Day is breaking, and there is much before us both."</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6335-00000036"/> 
               <p>Falcone glanced through the open window, and saw that the light of the moon was fading before the rosy dawn of a brilliant day. He impressively said:</p> 
               <p>"I trust to your pledged word, Matra, and if you attempt to forfeit it, the penalty to you will be more terrible than you think."</p> 
               <p>"I comprehend," growled Matra, "that both my life and fortune are held in your hands. Take the girl as the ransom, and leave me in peace."</p> 
               <p>"So be it," and Falcone passed rapidly from the room. A few steps brought him to the entrance, but as he stepped from the piazza a lance whizzed past him and buried itself in the body of a tree which stood in front of the house. The first impulse of the young man was to rush back, pistol in hand, and punish this dastardly attempt upon his life, but prudence conquered. He felt assured that he held the events of the next few hours under his own control, and the cautious use of the means at his command would secure to him the hand of his adored Clarice.</p> 
               <p>He called out:</p> 
               <p>"Beware, Matra. Your treachery shall meet its just reward if you again attempt it toward me."</p> 
               <p>Before the words passed his lips he had placed himself behind the shelter of the thick shrubbery; and, baffled in his attempt, furious against the audacious fisherman, Baptisto muttered imprecations against him, and vowed in his heart to circumvent his plans, and preserve his own respectability by compassing the destruction of him who could impeach it.</p> 
               <p>He turned from the open window, and beheld Barnardo standing within a few feet of him. He sternly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What does this mean? What has brought Guilio Falcone here at such an unusual hour? and why have you made so insane an attack upon his life? I heard voices engaged in conversation, and I came hither just in time to see the shaft thrown after him."</p> 
               <p>"How then did you know this intruder to be Guilio Falcone?" asked Matra, suspiciously.</p> 
               <p>"His voice is familiar to me-what does his parting threat mean? What power can <emph>he</emph> have which can make you fear him?"</p> 
               <p>"We are equally in his power. He was with Luigni Roma at the last; he is fully aware of the character of the Violante and her commander, and he came hither to make a strange compact with me."</p> 
               <p>"I am interested; pray repeat to me all he said. Falcone is no vulgar fisher-lad, but a free son of the mountains, who, for a season, submits to the drudgery of an humble calling, that he may gain the means of independence. I have more respect for him than I cherish for most men; and-but no matter. What brought him hither, and what did he reveal to you, which nerved your cowardly soul to the task of attempting his life?"</p> 
               <p>"What will nerve your ruffianly one to the same effort," savagely responded Matra. "Listen to me, and then say if I did not well to make the attempt to kill him, even if it failed."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo made an imperious gesture, and Matra went on to relate the particulars of his interview with his rival with tolerable accuracy. He ended by saying:</p> 
               <p>"He was fool enough to say that he is the only person in possession of Luigni's dying revelations; and when he is settled with, we shall be safe. Give up my betrothed, indeed! I shall do no such foolish thing. Let it be your task, Barnardo, to see that this braggart boy is dealt with speedily, and my marriage-feast without interruption."</p> 
               <p>"And what shall be my reward therefor?" asked Barnardo, coldly. "Will it be another attempt to put me<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6335-00000037"/> where I shall be powerless to injure you? Three times this night have you prowled at my door, with fingers clutching the handle of the knife you would have driven home to my heart had I been so unwary as to sleep; yet now you ask my aid to put a dangerous rival from your path."</p> 
               <p>Matra listened with a sinking heart, but he warmly said:</p> 
               <p>"You malign me most foully, Barnardo; but I let that pass. Do me this last service; enable me to claim Clarice as mine to-morrow, by removing this young desperado from my path, and there is no demand you can make which I would think too extravagant a reward for the service. Get rid of him in the only safe manner for men implicated as you and I are, and name your own terms."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo seemed to reflect a few moments, and then asked:</p> 
               <p>"Does Falcone really propose to snatch the girl from you at the very altar?"</p> 
               <p>"Such is certainly his intention, and unless you interpose, he will accomplish it."</p> 
               <p>"And you consented to this?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, what else could I do, when I am so utterly in his power? You must take his life this day, or we are both ruined. If you fail to do it, I shall lose the brilliant alliance which is to make your fortune and mine."</p> 
               <p>"How much is <emph>my</emph> interest in the stake you are playing for?" asked Barnardo, significantly.</p> 
               <p>Matra hesitated.</p> 
               <p>"Let me see; a fourth of all I shall gain. That will be a noble bribe."</p> 
               <p>"That may, or may not be, but I am not satisfied with it. We must go halves if I undertake this dangerous counterplot. The danger will be mine, the gain must be shared equally."</p> 
               <p>Matra grew white with rage. He said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Are you not equally interested in getting rid of this witness against our traffic? You appear to forget that."</p> 
               <p>"Aye-but our positions are different. I am a reckless dare-devil, who cares nothing about the opinions of men; and I would as soon hoist the black flag openly, as throw out the one that now floats over my craft; but you have your respectability to care for, your comfortable home to preserve-perhaps even your life. I can sail away to-day safe under my own canvas, but you must stay here to abide the action of the law, or exchange the life of ease you love, for my reckless, roving career."</p> 
               <p>Matra shuddered at the possibility thus presented, for his was not that wild Corsican nature which delights in action, and seeks atonement for every wrong in the blood vengeance. He was essentially a man of peace, and he had also reached that time of life in which repose was necessary to him. He reluctantly said:</p> 
               <p>"I told you to name your own terms, and they shall be granted, provided you assure me the possession of this young girl as my wife."</p> 
               <p>"It is well. Make over to me the unconditional control of the Violante, and my hand shall dismiss a soul to its account before the sun that is now rising shall have descended in the west. Write down the terms of our agreement."</p> 
               <p>Matra sat down by a table, on which lay paper and pens, and rapidly dashed off a few lines to which he placed his signature. Barnardo scanned them carefully, and with a strange smile, said:</p> 
               <p>"Right, right; I am bound to take a <emph>life</emph> within the next few hours; but whose shall it be? Ah-h! whose shall it be?"</p> 
               <p>"Your enemy's, of course. What can you be dreaming of, Barnardo?"</p> 
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6335-00000038"/> 
               <p>"Of <emph>Retribution,</emph>" replied the brigand, vacantly. "It never fails, but its instruments are sometimes strangely chosen. Good night, or rather good morning, Matra, for there comes the sun. I must be acting, acting, if I would redeem my pledge."</p> 
               <p>"You will not fail me?" asked Matra, with solicitude, for there was something in the manner of his companion which inspired him with distrust.</p> 
               <p>"My <emph>hand never fails,</emph>" replied Barnardo, with ominous emphasis; and he stalked from the house without another word. When he reached the gate, he turned and looked back at the palazzo, with its beautiful surroundings, and a heavy frown gathered darkly over his brows as he shook his hand menacingly toward it.</p> 
               <p>"Fatal walls in which to bring a helpless girl to share the life of a concealed brigand. For once I will aid the cause of justice, let what will come of it. Last night that creature would have killed me had I slept while tarrying beneath his roof; yet now he asks me to dye my hands in the blood of an innocent man, to save him from the shame he merits. Aye, Matra, a <emph>life</emph> shall be taken, but time will prove whose it shall be. A few hours more, and you and I will be quits."</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BRIDAL REVELRY. AN UNEXPECTED RESCUE.</head> 
               <p>THE cottage of Dame Marcante displayed a scene of bustle and gaiety befitting the importance of the event about to be celebrated. A triumphal arch formed of evergreens and flowers, decorated with streamers of gay ribbon, was erected in front of the house, and the friends of the family, dressed in their gayest habiliments, were assembled there at an early hour to form an escort for the bride to the residence of her future husband.</p> 
               <p>The marriage ceremonies in Corsica are very striking and peculiar, and it was Matra's intention to follow them in every particular. No expense had been spared by him to render his bridal feast the most remarkable that had been given for years among his class in the town. The keen trader knew that the liberal expenditure of money would silence the mutterings of those who marvelled at the rapidity with which he accumulated it, and he lavished his abundance without stint on this auspicious occasion.</p> 
               <p>The pale bride sat in her room listening intently to every sound from without, and her poor heart alternately thrilled with hope, or sunk in the cold apathy of despair. Ninetta was dressing her hair, and her dark, heavy features and uncultivated expression, formed a striking contrast to the grace and natural refinement visible in the colorless face brought in such striking comparison with her own.</p> 
               <p>The features of Senora Marcante's daughter were of the common Italian type, but there was the beauty of youth and freshness in the full lips and ruddy cheeks of the peasant girl. She wore a scarlet silk dress, the gift of the bridegroom for this especial occasion, and was adorned with a profusion of gold jewelry, much of which came from the same liberal donor. Ah! could the girl have known the history attached to each one of these ornaments, with what superstitious horror would she have shrank from permitting them to touch her innocent person.</p> 
               <p>Ninetta wove in the last orange blossom, and marvelling at the apathy of Clarice, lifted a filmy white robe from the bed, as she exultingly said:</p> 
               <p>"See, Clarice, this dress is as elegant as the baron's<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6335-00000039"/> daughter could afford. You are a silly girl to look so white and wretched, when the rich Matra is ready to lavish all his fortune upon you. Oh! I wish--"</p> 
               <p>"Not that you were in my place, I hope, Ninetta," said the unhappy bride. "Matra, in spite of his wealth, is no more a fitting mate for you than he is for me."</p> 
               <p>"You mean he is too old for either of us, and that is very true; but mother says that you must marry him because you are unfit to labor, and he can keep you like the greatest lady in the land. Well, I confess that I love pretty things and fine things, but if I must take a husband three times my own age to get them, I believe I would rather let them alone, after all. Yet it's very grand, Clarice, to have such a wedding as yours will be, and to wear such a dress as this. I declare you are as beautiful in it as the Princess in the fairy tale."</p> 
               <p>Clarice neither smiled nor blushed at this flattery. The painful tension of her heart seemed to have locked the life current around it, and she scarcely comprehended the prattle of her companion. She watched for some token from Guilio that measures had been taken for her rescue from her threatened fate, and as time passed on without bringing such assurance, her fingers mechanically wandered toward the handle of the poniard which was concealed beneath the snowy folds of her bridal robes.</p> 
               <p>There was Roman resolution in the heart of that fragile girl, and her mind was made up to escape the degradation of becoming Matra's wife by suicide, if no other avenue opened before her.</p> 
               <p>Ninetta opened a casket, and took from it a necklace of Roman pearls.</p> 
               <p>"See," she said, "what a magnificent set of jewels Matra has sent, with the request that you will wear them to-day. Oh! you <emph>must</emph> like him in time, Clarice, for he is liberal as a prince. He will make you such a grand lady, that I shall soon feel almost afraid to call you sister."</p> 
               <p>"Child, do not speak thus!" exclaimed Clarice, impetuously. "When this man has reduced me to the level of <emph>his</emph> wife, I shall be unworthy to lift my head in the light of day. Then you may blush to claim me, but never-never think it an honor to barter all that is precious in the human soul for the ease that wealth may purchase. Ninetta, whatever my mother may do with me, I charge you never to permit yourself to be bartered away as I have been. It is sinning before God and man, to permit the priest to bless such a union as this will be."</p> 
               <p>The girl looked into her pallid face, with her dark eyes blazing with excitement, and almost shrank away-for she could not understand the nature she had to deal with. While Clarice was uttering this passionate outburst, Senora Marcante entered unperceived. She imperiously said:</p> 
               <p>"He will seldom bless one that promises to be more fortunate. You do well in the last hours left you beneath your mother's roof, to endeavor to instigate your young sister to rebel against my authority over her. How have you fared in your own efforts to do so? Ninetta can take warning by your failure, and learn from it that I rule the destiny of my children."</p> 
               <p>Clarice turned toward her, and the eyes of the two met in an unflinching gaze: She firmly said:</p> 
               <p>"If I believed in the validity of your claims upon me, I might be more willing to yield obedience to your commands. Madam, the appeals of <emph>your</emph> daughter would have been listened to, but I have been crushed into subjection, and no voice allowed me in the arrangement which is to thrust me into a position of utter misery. Oh, it is cruel, cruel, to outrage a human being thus!"</p> 
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6335-00000040"/> 
               <p>The face of the listener was alternately flushed with rage and pale with apprehension. Her black eyes flashed with passion as she stood in front of the bride, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I have done no more than every parent is bound to do. As my child, you belong to me till I give you to the man I have chosen as my son-in-law. The idle fancy which has fixed itself in your demented brain, may as well be laid at rest. You are but the peasant girl of Isola Rossa, and the daughter of humble parents. Matra stoops to lift you to his level, and it is my will that you go with him to his home. It is disgraceful for a girl to proclaim her aversion to her bridegroom upon her wedding morning."</p> 
               <p>The eyes of Clarice gleamed with a singular light, and her white lips slightly curled as she said:</p> 
               <p>"What you may consider even deeper disgrace than that, may fall on you before this day is passed, Madam. I make no idle threats, but I bid you beware of what may be done by one driven to desperation as I am."</p> 
               <p>"Stuff! you're trying to imitate Marie Montoni in her play-actoring, but it won't do with me. I have all my wits about me, and I know that you can't help yourself now. You are as safe to be made the wife of Matra as if the priest had already pronounced the blessing. I came in now to tell you that the people are waiting, and it is time to form the procession to Matra's house. Come, Ninetta, put the pearls upon her neck and arms, and all will be ready."</p> 
               <p>Thus bidden, the girl held up the rich necklace again; the eyes of Clarice fell vaguely upon it. Two of the beads were slightly discolored, and she put back the ornament with a shudder as she muttered:</p> 
               <p>"No, no-it is stained with blood. See, the red spots have been partly removed, but they still show plainly. They shall never touch me-never!"</p> 
                
               <p>Senora Marcante regarded her as if she believed that insanity had really attacked her. She said:</p> 
               <p>"It was Matra's wish that you should wear them to-day, but it matters not. You are at liberty to reject his gifts if they do not please you, but you shall not refuse his hand. Come, then, your toilette is finished, and there is no need to wait longer."</p> 
               <p>"She has no bouquet," said Ninetta, hurriedly. "Marie promised to send one, but it has not come yet."</p> 
               <p>"Never mind; one can easily be made from the loads of flowers in the house. Hasten, and bind one together."</p> 
               <p>Ninetta went toward the door, but as she unclosed it, a girl presented an exquisitely arranged bouquet, with the words:</p> 
               <p>"From Marie Montoni to her friend Clarice, with assurances of hope and happiness in the union before her."</p> 
               <p>Clarice cast a lightning glance upon the flowers; a pale rose tint gleamed upon her cheeks, and she pressed them to her lips and heart. Tears sprang to her eyes, and after a brief moment of intense emotion, she turned toward the harsh woman who was intently watching her, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me for all my waywardness. I am ready now to join our friends, and go upon the path to meet my bridegroom. My will has passed beneath the control of others, and I submit to the decrees of fate."</p> 
               <p>"Hum-I thought you would be reasonable when nothing but submission was left to you. It's well that you have come to your senses at last, for I began to fear that Matra would be compelled to put you in the lunatic asylum, sure enough. He is a fine fellow, and you will soon find that you can be very happy with him."</p> 
               <p>Clarice scarcely heard her words. Her whole form seemed transfigured by the new hope breathed into her soul by the touch of the magic flowers. The solution of this was, that<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6335-00000041"/> Marie had agreed upon a certain arrangement of them if the plan for her rescue promised success, and the white rosebud that crowned the bouquet, surrounded by a circle of scarlet geranium, informed Clarice that Guilio would snatch her from the fate she so deeply dreaded.</p> 
               <p>As she appeared, the women, in their gala dresses, crowded around her, offering congratulations and wishes for her happiness and prosperity. These were received with the modest grace which had ever characterized her in her intercourse with the people of the town. With some effort she at last gained the door; on its threshold stood a youth in the picturesque and highly-ornamented costume of the country, and bowing lowly before the young beauty, he uttered the address prepared for him.</p> 
               <p>"Fair pearl of Isola Rossa, why will you leave the home of your childhood? In your new abode do you hope to find warmer hearts or truer joys than have been yours beneath the tender care of a mother's love? What have you needed that her generosity has not supplied to you? Flowers bloom around you, and friends cluster on every side, yet you have elected to leave all these blessings, and seek happiness in a new sphere. We cannot deny you this privilege, and we have gathered here to-day to offer you our warmest wishes for your happiness in the new career that opens before you; to bid you a most affectionate farewell before you change your name and station."</p> 
               <p>With forced composure Clarice listened to this address, and a few tears forced themselves from her burning eyes. At its close she put forth her hand, and placed in that of the speaker a small sum of money as a tribute to the commune, while she gracefully thanked him for his kind wishes.</p> 
               <p>He bowed profoundly over the fair hand, and stepped back to permit a party of youths adorned with gay streamers of ribbon, to bring forward a horse, gorgeously caparisoned, for her use.</p> 
               <p>Clarice was placed upon the saddle, and with flowers, banners, and fluttering scarfs, to the sound of glad music, she was escorted beneath a triumphal arch formed of orange and myrtle boughs, toward the house of the expectant Matra, followed in procession by the crowd, in whose dress the love of gay colors, indigenous to a southern land, was brilliantly displayed. A wheel surrounded with many spindles, and decorated also with long streamers of ribbon, was borne before her toward the dwelling of the bridegroom. This was intended to indicate the thrift and economy she was expected to practise in her new career.</p> 
               <p>Once in the open air, the poor girl seemed to breathe more freely, and she looked around with an eager, searching glance, in the hope that her bridle rein would at once be seized, and herself borne away to a place of safety, before the crowds that thronged the streets could behold her thus exhibited as the bride of Matra.</p> 
               <p>In spite of the assurance she had so lately received, her heart sank within her as she saw no such indication, and summoning all her courage to her aid, she prepared for the trying ordeal before her.</p> 
               <p>The procession moved slowly forward, amid a continuous uproar, kept up by mandolines and bagpipes, increased by the firing of guns at intervals. Wine had been lavishly distributed at Matra's expense, and the air was full of rejoicings and congratulations.</p> 
               <p>At length they came in sight of Matra's villa, in front of which a magnificent triumphal arch had also been erected, beneath which his friends stood to receive the shrinking bride. No demonstration toward a rescue had occurred, and Clarice felt as if the grasp of some terrible fate was upon her as her eyes fell upon the dark, repulsive face of<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6335-00000042"/> Matra, who stood in the doorway, radiant with the certainty of a long cherished hope brought to its fulfilment. Her senses reeled, and she felt as if she must fall from her saddle. A voice breathed in her ear:</p> 
               <p>"It is not yet too late-sustain your courage, Senora. All will be well."</p> 
               <p>She glanced around, but saw no one on whom she could fix as her consoler in this trying moment; but the assurance contained in his words revived her, and she could smile on the two youths who rushed in hot haste from the bridal escort to contend for the honor of presenting to her the key of her new home. The swiftest rider won this privilege, and he triumphantly galloped back, bearing in his hand a flower as a symbol of the key. Clarice received it mechanically, for in spite of the hope she cherished, a cold dread crept over her that her fate would be sealed if she entered beneath that detested roof as the pledged wife of its owner.</p> 
               <p>As the party halted in front of the arch, a young man of great beauty stepped forward, and offered her an olive branch bound with ribbons, and gave her the usual welcome in a set speech.</p> 
               <p>"We bring to you, oh! chosen of the noble Matra's heart, the symbol of peace. May its gentle spirit dwell with you through all your wedded life; may every blessing crown your happy future, and joy go hand in hand with prosperity."</p> 
               <p>The speaker might have gone on, but he saw the expression of intense suffering in the face of the poor victim, and he bowed profoundly, and made way for the other actors in the pageant. There was no evidence of a stir among the crowd, and nerving herself anew for endurance, Clarice passed beneath the arch, while a number of women and girls showered upon her flowers, rice, and grains of wheat, from the verandah on which they stood. The fruits of the season were thrown among the escort, who eagerly caught and devoured them, while cries of welcome and wishes for good fortune to the bridal pair, arose in shrill chorus.</p> 
               <p>From the rejoicings, a stranger would have thought this the happiest and most suitable marriage that had ever taken place in the town; but one glance upon the pale, excited face of her who bore the chief part in the pageant, must have revealed a very different story.</p> 
               <p>Many knew the reluctance with which Clarice had been forced into this marriage, and some speculated as to how it would end; for it was known to all present that Giulio Falcone was not a man tamely to submit to have his promised bride given to another at the bidding of her imperious mother. An old man who for the occasion played the part of father to Matra, advanced to receive the cortge of the bride, and thus addressed them:</p> 
               <p>"Who are you, who have come hither bringing with you this fair girl? Shall we welcome you as friends, or treat you as enemies? Are you the accepted escort of this gentle lady, or have you carried her off by violence? You, however, look to me like true and honorable men."</p> 
               <p>The attendants of the bride replied:</p> 
               <p>"We are gallant and honorable cavaliers, and we bring this beautiful and charming virgin as a pledge of love and friendship. We have gathered the choicest flowers as an offering for the happy bridegroom."</p> 
               <p>"You are welcome, friends; enter and partake of the banquet prepared for our guests."</p> 
               <p>The old man then lifted the trembling Clarice from her horse, embraced her with fatherly tenderness, and conducted her within the house. Here came the trial she had hoped to be spared-the exultant bridegroom stood upon the threshold to receive her, and she felt his coarse lips pressed<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6335-00000043"/> upon her own, his polluting arm enfolding her form, with a fierce feeling of repulsion which impelled her to snatch the stiletto from her breast, and thrust it in his heart. The motion she made to effect this was detected by one who evidently followed her footsteps closely, and the same voice which had before spoken to her again softly breathed:</p> 
               <p>"Watch and wait; help often comes at the eleventh hour."</p> 
               <p>Clarice dropped her hand, and looked around; she beheld only the smiling faces of friends and neighbors, from whom this warning could not have come; but she gained courage to maintain her outward calmness in the certainty that the hope of a rescue yet remained to her.</p> 
               <p>Senora Matra came forward, pressed her icy lips to the brow of her new daughter, and uttered a few sentences of welcome which she vainly endeavored to render cordial. Clarice mechanically received them, and the old woman registered this indifference against her for future punishment, for her bitter, hard nature had again asserted itself, and she could not forgive the young girl for the possession of the very advantages which had led Matra to seek her as his wife.</p> 
               <p>A magnificent collation was served, and the health and happiness of the pair were enthusiastically drank by the guests. Clarice could eat nothing, but she could not refuse the wine that was pressed upon her at all sides; and the small quantity she sipped from the overflowing bumpers filled for her, gave her strength to go through with all that lay before her.</p> 
               <p>It was now time to proceed toward the chapel, which was situated on Matra's land, and stood within a grove a few hundred yards from his gate. Candles were already lighted upon the altar, and branches of myrtle were placed on every available spot.</p> 
               <p>Again the procession formed, and Matra, with the air of a sultan towards his slave, took the passive hand of his bride within his own. Its cold touch induced him to glance into her face, and what he read there caused his swarthy features to grow purple with rage. He could not resist the impulse that moved him to bend forward, and hiss into her shrinking ear:</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, Senora. You are now <emph>mine,</emph> and I will soon make you feel that you shall fear me, if you will not love me."</p> 
               <p>At the same moment he clutched her hand with such force as almost to compel her to cry out. The helpless girl cast a bewildered glance around, hoping that some new token might be given her of the presence of at least one friend near her; her eyes fell upon the figure of a tall man with a priest's cowl drawn over his features. He made a rapid sign with his hand, and she felt reassured in a measure, though her heart beat rapidly, and a vivid blush succeeded the late paleness of her complexion.</p> 
               <p>Matra led her forward, and the bridal party issued from the house. The bridegroom looked exultant, and his natural ungainliness seemed only increased by the gay colors with which he had adorned himself. Diamond buttons glittered upon his broad bosom, and his fat fingers also bore upon them more than one gem of price. His insolent eyes sought those of Clarice, and she shrank and quivered before their expression of exulting triumph, with the feeling that death would be preferable to life as the slave of his caprices.</p> 
               <p>As the cortge gained the open air, a party of horsemen, with brilliant housings and fluttering ribbons, came sweeping across the lawn, followed by a band of musicians playing upon the bagpipes so loudly that the tones of the softer instruments that accompanied them were completely drowned.</p> 
               <p>The leader of this band wore a mask representing the<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6335-00000044"/> face of Neptune. In his hand he bore a branch of seaweed, and sprays of the same hung over his breast and shoulders.</p> 
               <p>This was a portion of the pageant which Matra had not commanded, and he looked with some solicitude to see what the intentions of the new-comers were. As they drew near, he recognized one form among them as that of Barnardo, and he had no further fear of a hostile movement from them.</p> 
               <p>The bridal party had gained the open space near the outer gate, when the horsemen drew up their steeds in front of them, and their leader spoke in a loud voice, as he bent forward and offered to the bride the seaweed he carried:</p> 
               <p>"Maiden, I bring thee tribute from my domains, and the sea-nymphs ask to behold their chosen sister once again. Shall they cry in vain, or shall the free life of the ocean find favor above the caged one of the land? Speak now, for on your decision rests your future happiness."</p> 
               <p>He held out his strong hand, bent his lithe form suddenly forward, and in another instant the light figure of Clarice was lifted to his saddle and placed before him. One bound of his well-trained steed carried him beyond the reach of Matra's immediate friends, and the party that accompanied him immediately closed upon his rear in such a manner as effectually to protect him from assault.</p> 
               <p>Pallid and foaming with rage, the baffled bridegroom called out:</p> 
               <p>"It is Falcone; he has robbed me basely. A thousand scudi to him who brings back Clarice to me."</p> 
               <p>The crowd rushed off in pursuit. Matra, blind with passion and disappointment, threw himself upon a horse belonging to one of his friends, and galloped away in the forlorn hope of overtaking the daring abductor and his party. A few others followed him, but he soon outstripped them, and suddenly found himself face to face with a stalwart wart man in the garb of a priest, who wheeled into the road before him from a coppice in which he had covertly awaited the appearance of his prey.</p> 
               <p>"Out of my way! Out of my way!" imperiously shouted Matra. "Why do you thus cross my path when I have not a moment to lose?"</p> 
               <p>"Because it will be useless to go further upon it. Falcone must reach his bark in safety, and retain his well-won bride."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>His</emph> bride! mine-mine," yelled the exasperated man. "Wretch! who are you, that you dare to speak thus? Get out of my way, or I will kill you."</p> 
               <p>He snatched a pistol from his breast, and pointed it toward the heart of his opponent. As the man struck it up, the cowl fell from his head, and Matra recognized the fixed, implacable face of Barnardo, as the flashing steel in his unflinching hand was thrust again and again into his body.</p> 
               <p>"Take that, and that, robber, brigand; and now the Violante is mine. Thus I avenge the insults I have borne from you, miserable mass of selfishness that you are."</p> 
               <p>Matra fell forward, his horse reared, and turned back upon the path he had lately passed over, and while the murderer fled toward the sea-shore, the gaily dressed corpse of the bridegroom was dragged back amid his horror-stricken friends, at the heels of his frightened steed.</p> 
               <p>Wild cries and lamentations took the place of the late jubilant shouts, and threats of the blood vengeance were heard on every side. There was but one opinion, that Falcone had taken the life of his rival, and he must be held responsible for the deed. This penalty in that land of the vendetta is a species of social ostracism, for it cuts off a man from every enjoyment of civilized life, and compels him to dwell amid the fastnesses of the hills, leading the comfortless<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6335-00000045"/> and uncertain life of the outlaw. A bandit in Corsica does not always, nor indeed often mean a robber, but simply a man under the ban of the law; and to such Falcone henceforth belonged.</p> 
               <p>The feet of the murdered man were released from the stirrups that held them, and his blood-stained form was lifted by his friends and borne toward the home which had been prepared for so different a scene.</p> 
               <p>His mother, with glaring eyes and foreboding heart, stood upon the piazza, wildly muttering:</p> 
               <p>"My vision was true, oh woe is me! woe is me! They bring my son in their arms; he is helpless; he is lifeless; and the stain of blood is upon his garments. Alas! his life-current has ensanguined them."</p> 
               <p>Her voice gradually arose to a despairing cry, which reached those who came slowly and mournfully toward the abode so lately full of mirth. In sad silence they laid the dead body at the mother's feet, and the oldest man of the group sternly said:</p> 
               <p>"The vengeance rests with you; let it be swift and sure."</p> 
               <p>The old woman bent over her slain son, and stifled the cry of nature in her eager thirst for retribution. She cried out:</p> 
               <p>"Men, I have money, which I will liberally share with you, if you will grant me your assistance in the stern task before me. Though the bandit has himself escaped us now, the family of her through whom this calamity fell upon me, are still in our power. The vendetta spares none of her blood, and Senora Marcante and her children are in our midst. Strike, and spare not, that the base girl may drink the blood of her kindred."</p> 
               <p>In the suddenness of the escape, and the events which so rapidly followed it, Senora Marcante had hitherto sat as one stupefied by something which she could not comprehend. That all her plans of self-aggrandizement should have been thus overturned, was incomprehensible to one of her dull, imperious nature. She sat dumb and bewildered, till the words of the fierce old tigress aroused her to a sense of the imminence of the danger that threatened not only her own life but that of her children.</p> 
               <p>Ninetta and the boy had crouched down beside her in extreme fright; for amid this wild people no one could foretell what tragic turn events might take. At the words of the bereaved mother, a few of their friends gathered in front of them, and protested against any violence being used toward those who had entered the house as honored guests.</p> 
               <p>With great effort Senora Marcante recovered sufficiently from the first effects of the shock, to arise, and with much excitement to speak in her own defence.</p> 
               <p>"My friends, I never expected to tell this tale, but now I have no choice left me. The young girl hitherto known as Clarice Marcante, is not of my blood, and I proclaim myself and my children free from the penalty due to the crime she has doubtless instigated. Clarice is only my adopted daughter, as I can soon prove to the satisfaction of all here present."</p> 
               <p>Amid the incredulous murmurs of the crowd, the widow spoke in her stern, hard tones:</p> 
               <p>"In my despair I had forgotten; it is true-Clarice is no child of hers. Had she been, my son would have left her to her humble fortune."</p> 
               <p>At these words Senora Marcante tossed her head defiantly, and cast a disdainful glance toward the dead Matra, but her eyes were quickly withdrawn, and she shuddered at the expression of hatred and despair indelibly fixed upon his stiffening features.</p> 
               <p>His mother stooped forward, lifted him in her arms, and<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6335-00000046"/> with the assistance of others, bore him into the house, and placed him upon a couch. Then kneeling beside his form, she tore from his breast the blood-stained shirt, and fastened a portion of it upon her own bosom. Then, in tones of piercing anguish, mingled with fiery passion, she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"I invoke upon his murderer, and on her who instigated the crime, the extremity of vengeance. Vendetta to the last drop of blood flowing in their veins, I here declare, and I devote the remnant of my life to its accomplishment.</p> 
               <p>"Friends, sing those death-songs in which the vengeance of the murdered man's relatives is shown to be a sacred duty."</p> 
               <p>She bowed her head over the lifeless body, and a group gathered around the death couch, and raised a wild, heart-piercing wail, which seemed the very outburst of impassioned despair, with the fiercer cry of vengeance thrilling through the heart of the melody as a fearful monotone.</p> 
               <p>As the Marsellaise moved the heart of revolutionary France, so are those of the Corsicans affected by their voceros; and few houses in that land of impulsive passion and reckless vendetta have not resounded with them; for it is said that from a population of less than three hundred thousand, two hundred annually perish from the implacable blood-vengeance.</p> 
               <p>The women who had come to witness a bridal, now removed their ornaments, loosened their hair, and joining their hands, performed a death dance around the bier, to the music of their own wild wailings, and soon the dramatic vivacity of the scene became terrible to witness.</p> 
               <p>One of the youngest girls present led the improvisation, and as her burning words fell upon the ears of the listeners, their eyes gleamed with fury, while they struck the palms of their hands together, rent their hair, and beat their breasts, amid sobs and lamentations for the fate of the fallen man.</p> 
                
               <p>When their excitement reached its climax, they threw themselves upon the couch, and scattered dust upon their heads after the manner of the ancient Hebrews.</p> 
               <p>At length, exhausted by the violence of their emotions, the actors in this lugubrious scene threw themselves upon the floor, and sat as motionless as the dead man whose fate they mourned; the wild wail died away in deep respirations, for they were nearly breathless from the violent exertions they had made, and they sat with bowed heads, and folded hands, in an attitude expressive of the deepest grief.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime, the friends of Senora Marcante deemed it advisable for her and her children to leave the house of Matra, for their near connection with Clarice must have incurred for them the hostility of all his family.</p> 
               <p>A few young men, armed with carbines and the ever ready stiletto, formed their escort upon the road over which they had so lately passed in triumph. Quite a crowd followed them through curiosity to learn the truth respecting Clarice, and some among them could well remember the stranger who had died in Senora Marcante's cottage many years before.</p> 
               <p>When they reached her door, the widow paused, and made an attempt to dismiss the curious crowd, by saying:</p> 
               <p>"Many thanks, my friends, for your company and protection; this is a sad ending to a wedding, but I trust when my <emph>own</emph> daughter is married, no such scandal will fall upon my respectable name. Clarice is not my child; for the present, let this assurance suffice; and now good day, friends, for I must weep in solitude over the grievous fault this poor girl has committed. She was dear to my heart, though not of my blood."</p> 
               <p>An audible murmur of discontent arose, and a small, shrewd-looking man stepped forward, and said:</p> 
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6335-00000047"/> 
               <p>"If our sympathy and protection are worth anything they are surely worth the clearing up of this mystery. If Clarice is not your child, whose, then, is she? and why has this deception been so long maintained? Your neighbors have looked upon you as a respectable woman, Senora Marcante, but unless this affair is satisfactorily explained, how shall you maintain that position? If no disgrace is attached to the story, you need not shrink from revealing it. If there is, we have a right to hear it, that we may know how to regard you in time to come."</p> 
               <p>As this address proceeded, the widow flushed a fiery red, and then grew pale. She saw no alternative remained to her, and her well-kept secret must become the property of her friends. She replied, in a tolerably steady voice:</p> 
               <p>"I request all to enter who are interested in hearing a simple story, which reflects no discredit on me."</p> 
               <p>Thus invited, the party crowded into the cottage, completely filling the central room with eager faces, and ears thirsting for the development of the promised mystery. After a pause, as if she was recalling the incidents of those days which had so long passed away, Senora Marcante began:</p> 
               <p>"My friends, it is now seventeen years since a worn and weary woman, carrying a babe in her arms, asked at my door for a cup of milk, and a few hours' shelter beneath the roof of the humble cabin in which I then lived as the wife of Pietro the fisherman.</p> 
               <p>"Both requests were granted, for I saw that the poor delicate creature was sinking with fatigue; I took her infant from her arms, for it was the same age as my own little darling that lay asleep in the cradle. I washed and nursed it, while the poor mother looked on with a kind of quiet apathy, as if life and every interest belonging to it had perished from her heart.</p> 
                
               <p>"After resting an hour, she thanked me, and arose to go, but as she attempted to cross the threshold she fainted and fell. I put her to bed, and Pietro and I did the best we could by her, for my husband said we must never cast out the helpless and sick wayfarer.</p> 
               <p>"Besides, for I will not make out that we were better than we really were, in undressing her, I discovered that her underclothing was of the finest material, and concealed around her waist she wore a band filled with gold pieces. There was more money in it than we had ever seen together before, and we felt certain that whatever we might do for the stranger would be well repaid.</p> 
               <p>"Well, to make a long story short, the lady never held her head up again, though she lingered nearly a year before death finally took her away. In the meantime, a malady that proved fatal among children broke out in Isola Rossa, and both the little ones sickened with it. My child died, but after a severe struggle the stranger's infant was spared. When I took it to her bedside, she looked on it almost with an expression of regret, and said:</p> 
               <p>"'I hoped she would have been taken before me, but such is not the will of Heaven. Oh! Senora, what will become of this poor babe when I am gone?'</p> 
               <p>"I do not know what impulse moved me, but I said:</p> 
               <p>"'If you can do no better with her, let me take her as my own, in place of the child which perhaps God has taken from me to make room for this one.'</p> 
               <p>"I own that I thought of the gold, and I knew that it would more than repay me for my care of the child. The poor lady instantly caught at the idea, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"'Oh! if it can be done! if it can only be done without suspicion. Can you keep the secret of this exchange? Can you baffle search, if such is made, and always-<emph>always</emph> keep the child as your own?'</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6335-00000048"/> 
               <p>"I thought I could easily do that, for I did not believe any one would suspect me of taking the babe of the stranger as my own. There had been so much sickness in the town that for weeks no visitor had entered my cabin; for in those days of poverty and struggle we were not much troubled with company. The sick woman bade me consult with my husband, and if he did not oppose the transfer, she would speak with him on the terms.</p> 
               <p>"Pietro had become attached to the little girl, and now our child was gone, he was glad to keep her; so he said yes at once, and then the stranger bound us both by a solemn oath to raise her as our own daughter, and never to permit her to think for a moment that she was not our child. The mother said that she believed she would be happier in our humble home than with those to whom she of right belonged.</p> 
               <p>"When these matters had been satisfactorily settled, the lady gave Pietro gold enough to buy himself a trading boat, and a small stock of wares, which laid the foundation for his after-prosperity. By her orders, he purchased for her such furniture as made her room comfortable, and we removed into this cottage, which she also paid for; to her we owe all the prosperity that came to us, and I swore to her that I would do by Clarice exactly as if she was my own child, and never seek to discover her true origin. That I religiously kept my oath, you can all bear witness, for until to-day no one has dreamed that the girl was not my child."</p> 
               <p>"It seems that Matra knew it, or he would not have sought her for his wife," said one, who recalled the words of the bereaved mother.</p> 
               <p>"If Matra knew it, he has gained no clue from me. As Clarice grew toward womanhood, I saw how fair and delicate she was, and I naturally thought a rich home would suit her better than a poor one. I insisted that she should accept Matra, but now I begin to fear that I was too harsh. I should have listened to her objections, and perhaps she would not have rushed upon the fate that now threatens her."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose she turns out to be some great man's child?" suggested one. "If she is, her family will protect Guilio for her sake. Depend on it, Matra thought he could serve his own interests well, or he would never have sought her."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so; though a child of mine would have been good enough for such as Matra. Let Clarice prove to be who she may, it can be of no benefit to me or mine, for I disclaim all interest in her. The family of the murdered man shall have no cause of vendetta against us."</p> 
               <p>"Right, senora; that is the only safe course to pursue, for that old beldame is vindictive as a tigress, and her vengeance will not stop short of every soul connected by blood with those who caused the murder of her son."</p> 
               <p>"She will find none to sacrifice that I know of, except Guilio and the girl herself, unless she can ascertain her true family."</p> 
               <p>"And she will spare no efforts to do that. Well, senora, you have honorably performed all you engaged to do, and I trust that no evil will come to you from any connection with this runaway bride. We are your friends at all events, and you may count on us, should you need us to protect you."</p> 
               <p>The widow warmly thanked the speaker, and declared that henceforth all intercourse between her adopted daughter and herself was at an end. Neither she nor her children would acknowledge Clarice as connected with them in any manner. Ninetta and Pietra protested against this decision with tears, declaring that she had been as a sister to them too long to be cast off in this summary manner. Their mother frowned, and silenced them by saying:</p> 
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6335-00000049"/> 
               <p>"Your only safety lies in giving her up forever. Clarice has forsaken us, not we her. Let her go upon the path she has chosen, which I hope will be as far as possible from that trodden by me and mine."</p> 
               <p>The crowd at length departed to seek fresh excitement in learning what had been the result of the pursuit after the fugitives, and the widow, crest-fallen and deeply alarmed at the unlooked-for result of her ambitious projects, barred her doors and windows, and retired to the solitude of her own apartment to meditate upon the best means of ensuring the safety of herself and family from the enmity of the murdered man's friends.</p> 
               <p>Although innocent of any agency in bringing about the catastrophe of the day, Senora Marcante knew that among a people so easily excited, and so reckless in the vendetta, that she and her children were placed in a very critical position with reference to the relatives of Matra. He had no brother to avenge him, but he had nephews and cousins, who would equally consider it a sacred duty, by the Corsican code, to sacrifice those implicated in any vital manner with the assassin of their kinsman; and her knowledge of Senora Matra's character, caused her to feel that if no other victims could be found, her family would surely be marked out for destruction.</p> 
               <p>Too late did she repent her hardness toward the poor girl who had caused all this trouble, and wish that she had listened to her prayers to be permitted to give her hand to him who claimed her heart. But it was too late now; the stamp of Fate was placed upon the sad future, and she could only tremble and weep over the results of her own harshness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">ALL FOR LOVE, AND THE WORLD WELL LOST.</head> 
               <p>GUILIO clasped his bride to his heart, and fled like the wind, surrounded by the faithful followers who had accompanied him on this perilous adventure. There were ten of them dressed as sea-monsters, and as they fled they faced around every few moments, with carbines unslung and ready for use, to keep their pursuers at bay. These consisted of a confused crowd of the revellers who had hurriedly mounted, and conspicuous among them were the two youths who had striven for the privilege of presenting to the bride the key of her new home. The victor in the contest shouted to those near him:</p> 
               <p>"Follow me; I know a short cut to the strand, and we can intercept them before they reach the boat."</p> 
               <p>Obedient to his command, the party turned and rushed with headlong speed down a narrow street leading toward the sea-shore. Two vessels lay there, a few hundred yards apart; the smaller one was decorated with flags and streamers, and this was recognized at once as the bark of Falcone; the men took such a position as must intercept the abductors and their prize, and each one looked to the condition of his arms, that he might be in readiness to give them a warm reception.</p> 
               <p>They had but few moments to wait before Falcone and his friends appeared in view. They did not falter at the sight of those opposed to them, but came sweeping steadily forward to a point from which two paths diverged. One of these led to the fishing smack, the other toward the Violante, which was slowly shaking out her sails, as if preparing to go on her next voyage.</p> 
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6335-00000050"/> 
               <p>A momentary halt was made, and a tall man wearing the dress of a monk galloped to the head of the group, and spoke a few words. He then waved his hand toward the felucca, and at the signal a boat shot from the further side, and rapidly approached the landing. To the chagrin and surprise of Matra's friends, Falcone and his companions rode swiftly in the same direction, dismounted, and before their pursuers could come within gunshot, were beyond their reach. A few carbines were fired on either side, but without effect, and Clarice, safe, and now quite self-possessed, was placed upon the deck of the Violante.</p> 
               <p>Her flag was run up, gay streamers thrown to the breeze, and a small cannon she carried was fired both as a bridal salute and as a defiance to her enemies, while the gallant little vessel glided swiftly from the shore.</p> 
               <p>The sailors, in picturesque holiday attire, were drawn up on deck to receive the bridal party, who were greeted with waving of caps and hearty cheers from these hardy sons of toil.</p> 
               <p>An awning had been spread, beneath which was a crimson carpet, on which seats for four persons were placed. A temporary altar stood near the railing, on which candles and myrtle blossoms had been placed, and beside it stood a barefooted monk, telling his beads and repeating aves with his lips, while his eyes took rapid note of all that passed before them. Flowers and gay ribbons were so disposed as to give quite a festive air to the little vessel, and Marie Montoni, with a smile of cordial welcome, came forward to receive the stolen bride.</p> 
               <p>Clarice had regained her self-command, and although tears were in her eyes, the color had again returned to her cheeks, and the heavy, painful throbbing of her heart had changed to the glad tide of hope and happiness. As she arose from the embrace of her friend, Guilio knelt before her and said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Welcome, my queen of the mountains, to the friendly bark of one who has stood by me in my need, in return for many important services it has been my good fortune to be able to render him. Clarice, I have not won you to be the wife of a fisher lad, but the companion of a mountain chief. Know that I am the son of that Theodore Falcone who took to the mountains and became a bandit, because his reasonable request to be allowed to obtain a substitute when drawn for the conscription was rudely refused by those in authority. With his proud career all our countrymen are familiar; his hand was stained with no crime, his soul with no meanness; and when he perished, a victim to the basest treachery, he who had reigned as a king over his banned and persecuted followers, laid down his life as nobly as he had borne it. 'Tis no ignoble hand which claims your own, my dainty fire-spirit, but one worthy to clasp with those of knights and gentlemen."</p> 
               <p>Clarice listened to this address with many varying emotions. A brilliant flush suffused her expressive features as she raised him from his kneeling position, and the pride of her nature shone forth in the words of her reply.</p> 
               <p>"Let us stand side by side, Guilio, free and equal, as husband and wife should be. I am yours, for you have doubly won me this day by your gallant rescue from the power of one I loathed. Let the vows be spoken which will bind us together for all time, that if our enemies pursue and capture us, they can have no power to separate me from the object of my choice. As the young fisherman, I preferred you to the rich Matra, and as the King of the Mountain I am worthy to share your lot. I ask no brighter, no better fate."</p> 
               <p>"Noble and true heart, your words are worthy of your high nature. They give me inexpressible happiness, my pearl of price," murmured Guilio with rapture. "We will<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6335-00000051"/> lose no time in having the marriage rites performed, though there is little prospect of pursuit, and less of being overtaken. The Violante is the fastest craft on these waters, and she already begins to show her powers."</p> 
               <p>While he was speaking the vessel glided gracefully out of the harbor, and Clarice cast a long glance toward the home she was leaving, perhaps forever. At a sign from Falcone, Captain Barnardo, now denuded of his monkish disguise, approached the party. Guilio took his hand, and said:</p> 
               <p>"This, Clarice, is my friend, as he was the friend of my father. He is the captain of this vessel, and to him we are indebted for our present safety."</p> 
               <p>Clarice grew pale as her eyes fell upon him. She nervously said:</p> 
               <p>"And he is also the partner of Matra. I have seen you many times Senor, and I trust that your presence here bodes us no evil. Pardon me, but so much-so much is at stake for us."</p> 
               <p>"Fear not, fair lady; my presence here insures your safety," replied Barnardo, with an air of courtly gallantry strangely at variance with his calling. "Without the aid I have afforded my young friend, you would now have been the wife of Matra. That I have helped to rescue you from his power should be to you the best proof that all bonds of fellowship between that ingrate and myself are forever broken."</p> 
               <p>With a bright smile Clarice extended her hand to him, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, in both Guilio's name and my own. My debt of gratitude is one that can never be cancelled."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo fixed his eyes upon her varying features with a penetrating expression that called a flush into her cheek. He abruptly asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"Is it the immutable purpose of your soul to abide by Guilio Falcone, let the future develop what it may with reference to yourself?"</p> 
               <p>The flush deepened and the eyes sparkled as she quickly and fervently responded:</p> 
               <p>"It is, so help me Heaven! But this is a strange inquiry-what can it mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Never mind; only answer me truly and faithfully, and all will be well. Will you swear to maintain your allegiance through every temptation? Even if wealth and high station must be relinquished by clinging to Falcone, would you still be true to your wedded vows?"</p> 
               <p>Clarice laughed scornfully:</p> 
               <p>"Faith, truth, love, would be of little worth if they could be crushed beneath temptation of any kind. Let the future bring what it may, Guilio is my king, I his queen; and now, I trust, you are answered."</p> 
               <p>Her slight form seemed to dilate; her eyes flashed with the fire of pride, and Barnardo bowed lowly before her, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"I am nobly answered, Senora. Now it only remains for Father Benedict to perform his duty."</p> 
               <p>The priest came forward, the lovers placed themselves before the altar, and the sailors gathered around with uncovered heads while the mass was being said. Then, with the cloudless sun flashing over the purple waves, the soft southern air fanning her kindling cheek, unconscious of her birthright, the daughter of the Ernesti plighted her vows to the man she loved, resolute in that hour to keep them, whatever fate might betide her in the future.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo looked on with a strange smile, and in his heart was the triumphant thought that by this marriage he gained the power to strike a deadly blow against one he loathed with that intensity which is born of rivalry in love,<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6335-00000052"/> and which subsequent events had even more deeply embittered.</p> 
               <p>The captain had rescued Clarice from Matra because he felt that she despised him, and would at once acquiesce in the efforts of her powerful family to break the bonds that bound her to him; but in this tie, she linked her fate with that of one to whom she would cling through good and evil report, in defiance of every effort that might be made by her haughty father to separate her from him.</p> 
               <p>As he gazed with piercing eyes upon the face of the bride, he marvelled that he had not before been struck by her resemblance to the friend of his youth, for such had Count Ernesti once been to him, widely as their paths had since diverged. The straight, delicately cut profile, and the haughty mouth, expressing pride, energy and strong will, were clearly derived from her paternal ancestry; while the deep clear eyes, so full of tenderness and truth, as they rested upon her newly wedded lord, were those of one he had loved in the days of his wayward and passionate youth, with all the fire of a fierce, untamable nature.</p> 
               <p>As Barnardo scanned this beautiful young creature with prophetic eye, he trusted and believed that she would prove true in life or death to the allegiance she had just plighted; that every temptation to swerve her from it would be resented as an insult to her womanhood. Only thus could he make her the Nemesis to the man he detested.</p> 
               <p>Clarice received the congratulations of her friends with tearful grace. Marie Montoni kissed her tenderly, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You are the wife of a noble and true man, and I trust that your life will be free and happy."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo lifted her hand to his lips, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Happiness and good fortune await the strong in heart. My young friend, Guilio, has made a lucky choice, Senora, for in you he has gained beauty, worth and love."</p> 
                
               <p>The sailors lifted their caps, and joined in a hurrah that made the welkin ring, while each one threw a handful of flowers which he carried for the purpose over the dress of the bride. She thanked them with animation, and Falcone briefly addressed them:</p> 
               <p>"This is the happiest day of my life, my friends, and as I desire that you shall all share in my joy, a feast has been prepared for you in the cabin below, at which you will drink to the health of myself and my bride."</p> 
               <p>Renewed vivas greeted this speech, mingled with the cry of-</p> 
               <p>"Long live the King of the Mountain!"</p> 
               <p>As they retired to the forward part of the vessel, Clarice turned her smiling glance upon Guilio, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is it really true that you claim this high-sounding title? Tell me who and what you really are, Guilio, for I truly believed you to be a fisherman when I consented to marry you."</p> 
               <p>"Sit down beside me, Clarice, and I will tell you the wild tale of my life and lineage. It has no stain of crime upon it, therefore am I ready to reveal all you desire to know."</p> 
               <p>Obedient to his wish, Clarice placed herself beside him, his strong arm enfolding her waist, and thus sustained, the runaway bride felt as if she could bid defiance to the world. Her soft eyes were lifted to his, as she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="ITA">Caro mio,</foreign> now proceed: tell me of your family, your rearing, and, above all, why you came to woo me in a character beneath your true one. Remember that the minutest incident concerning yourself is of interest to me."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my adored; and now listen to the sad tale of two noble hearts at war with the fate that finally conquered them."</p> 
               <p>After a brief pause, Falcone went on:</p> 
               <p>"My father was a fiery and haughty son of this soil, and<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6335-00000053"/> he esteemed the sacred rights of freemen above all price. He was drawn for the conscription when he was on the eve of marriage with one he tenderly loved. He asked the privilege of procuring a substitute, and his request was refused in such terms as fired his pride and aroused his opposition. He threw himself into the mountains, and took to the life of a bandit; he was not a robber, mark you, but a free mountain chief, who levied a tax upon the rich and cowardly, which he shared with the poor and oppressed.</p> 
               <p>"Theodore Falcone was adored by the peasantry, and feared by men in power; for his rule was that of nature and justice. He compelled the wealthy miser to contribute his share toward the general welfare, and the recipient of government patronage disgorged a portion of his spoils as an offering to the needy.</p> 
               <p>"His betrothed bride followed him to the fastnesses of the mountains, where she became his wife, and dwelt with him in an extensive cave which will soon witness the wedded happiness of his son. I only ask to be enabled to emulate my father in valor; to show the same magnanimity under misfortune, the same dauntless front which rendered him the terror of the mean, and the admiration of his high-spirited countrymen. I regard it as a proud distinction to be the son of a man so eminently worthy of the name of a Corsican, and of a woman who shrank from nothing by his side."</p> 
               <p>"Thus true will I be to you," murmured Clarice, and Guilio pressed her more closely to his heart, as he went on:</p> 
               <p>"My father could not have merit without making bitter enemies. Among those proscribed like himself, were persons who hated him for his preminence above them, and they only waited for a favorable opportunity to betray him to the authorities. He fell ill, and fancying that the atmosphere of the cave was injurious to him, he caused himself to be removed from his impregnable asylum to a hut a few miles off.</p> 
               <p>"An armed party came upon him without warning of their approach; they slew the sick lion, but not without themselves being torn by his claws, for he died like a Paladin with arms in his hands, which he used with good effect against his foes.</p> 
               <p>"I was then an infant in the cradle, and my mother snatched me from the fate they might have given me too, and fled to her mountain retreat. Amid those fastnesses she was safe from pursuit, and friends soon gathered to her assistance. The loyalty of the country people to their self-elected king, was shown by the voluntary offers of contributions still due him from some of the villages that acknowledged allegiance to his authority. Theodore Falcone's name was widely lamented, and his memory has been embalmed in song."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes," replied Clarice, softly. "I have sung those voceros myself, little dreaming that your father was their hero. Tell me of your mother; after her husband's death, what could she do alone?"</p> 
               <p>Guilio's voice took a tone of deep pathos, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"She too died; what else was left to her?"</p> 
               <p>"What! by her own hand?"</p> 
               <p>"No-not as a suicide; she was too brave for that. She slowly faded from the earth, with the firm conviction that her husband continually called upon her to join him beyond the dark river. My mother died of a broken heart in less than a year after her husband perished; thus I was thrown upon the kindness of strangers."</p> 
               <p>"And then?" asked the tender voice.</p> 
               <p>A cloud passed over Guilio's face, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"The life of an orphan child is seldom a happy one. I had no real claim on any one, for the family of my mother<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6335-00000054"/> had disowned her for following her betrothed to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchia,</foreign> and my father was the last of his name. I was friendless and homeless-a little waif thrown on the bleak shores of life, with no natural protector.</p> 
               <p>"But I was not suffered to perish. The contributions voluntarily offered after my father's death, made a small fund for my support till I was old enough to do something for myself. I was fortunate enough to attract the notice of Count Rospoli, a wealthy and eccentric man, living not far from the scene of my father's exploits, and he took sufficient interest in my fate to afford me some advantages of education, of which I eagerly availed myself.</p> 
               <p>"My patron would have made me a priest, but my nature revolted from the spiritual bonds he sought to impose on me. I had no calling for that vocation, and I refused to take vows which I felt that I could never keep. The count was deeply offended at my refusal, and cast me off. Shall I tell you why I persisted in my refusal, my Clarice? I had wandered in my childhood to Isola Rossa, had seen you there, and children as we were, I loved you, and vowed within my soul to win you to become my bride, and dwell with me as my mother had dwelt with her mountain chief in his lonely home.</p> 
               <p>"I knew the whole career of my father, and to emulate it was my irrevocable determination. I too would pursue the brave and independent career which had given him a place in the hearts of his countrymen. I adopted his belief-that he who takes from the superfluities of the rich, to ameliorate the condition of the suffering poor, is no robber, but a benefactor of his kind. God never meant that the craft of the few should enable them to board and grasp the overflowing abundance of the earth, while those who are equally his children, groan in despair and destitution. The division is unfair, and I resolved to follow in the steps of Theodore Falcone, and so far as lay in my power, endeavor to equalize the rights of men."</p> 
               <p>Clarice was too young and inexperienced to understand the fallacy of this reasoning. To her it sounded noble and grand, and she said, with enthusiasm:</p> 
               <p>"You are right, my Guilio, and I love you the more deeply for your benevolence. But tell me how you accomplished your resolution, against the opposition of your protector."</p> 
               <p>A glow of pride swept over the face of her lover, as he went on:</p> 
               <p>"I took the trusty carbine which had been the property of my father, and with a free step sought the mountain wilds in which he had met his tragic fate. I won your heart; but I knew that as the mountain chieftain, I could never claim you as my bride. Then I assumed the character of a fisherman, though my lugger was really engaged in a far different trade-but let that pass. My disguise enabled me to win you as my bride, and I am truly blessed."</p> 
               <p>"And Captain Barnardo? what is he to you?"</p> 
               <p>"The best friend I possess. Barnardo has long been a free trader, though his calling has not been known in the town from which we come to-day. It has often been my good fortune to be able to give him information that was important to his safety and success; and this morning, when he learned the strait we were in, he sought me out, and offered me such assistance as rendered your abduction certain.</p> 
               <p>"At his suggestion, the plan I had formed was slightly altered, and in place of taking you to my humble bark, he prepared to receive us on his felucca. We owe him our deepest gratitude for the aid he gave me at a most critical moment."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo here approached them, and with inimitable grace Clarice extended her hand to him, as she said:</p>

               <p>"Receive my warmest thanks for your kindness to us, Captain Barnardo. As the friend of Guilio, you must be mine also. I look upon you as having given me not only happiness, but life, for I would never have lived through the day that made me the wife of Matra."</p> 
               <p>"I suspected as much when I undertook to aid my friend Guilio to spirit you away from his rival. I am but a lawless rover of the sea, Senora, but I have some natural sense of justice left within me, and I could not see a helpless dove made the prey of a greedy cormorant, without putting out my arm to wrest her from so dreary a fate. I have done evil deeds in my life, but I trust this one act of retribution will lighten the account against me."</p> 
               <p>He spoke with gloomy sternness, and Clarice timidly said:</p> 
               <p>"Of retribution, Senor; I am afraid I do not understand you."</p> 
               <p>"Nor is it necessary that you should, though I will in some sort explain. I owed Matra repayment for many wrongs against myself and others, for he has been a sneaking traitor to every one that trusted him. A plausible villain, living in safety himself, while those who toiled that he might be rich, endured all the hardship. Then, at the last, when I trusted him so far as to seek the shelter of his roof, through trouble had arisen between us, he sought my door with the purpose of murder in his craven heart. I was on my guard, for I did not trust him; but from that moment his fate was sealed. I sought Guilio, and concerted with him the means of wresting you from him. You are here in safety, Senora, and Matra is--"</p> 
               <p>He paused, and Clarice apprehensively exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"No evil has happened to him, I trust; he is free, and safe?"</p> 
               <p>"Aye, free as air; never before so safe, for now he is powerless to injure any other creature."</p> 
                
               <p>Every vestige of color faded from her face, and she faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! you cannot mean that blood has stained my bridal day! That violence purchased my freedom?"</p> 
               <p>"I do mean, Senora, that my wrongs are wiped out, and you, as a necessary consequence, freed from the persecutions you have so long borne. Mine is an old grudge, so you need take to yourself no portion of the blame for what I have this day done."</p> 
               <p>"But," gasped Clarice, "Guilio must bear the vendetta. My mother, Ninetta, Pietro, what will become of them, thus left to the vengeance of Matra's family?"</p> 
               <p>"Make yourself easy on that score, for Senora Marcante will deny that you are her child, nay, will prove it, too, and for the treasure I have secured to him, the King of the Mountains can well afford to take the responsibility of slaying his rival."</p> 
               <p>"You killed him, then?" syllabled the pale lips.</p> 
               <p>"My aim is always true, and my carbine was levelled at his heart," replied Barnardo, with gloomy pride.</p> 
               <p>"And I? what can you mean by saying that Senora Marcante will prove me not her daughter?"</p> 
               <p>Barnardo cast a penetrating glance upon her as he impressively asked:</p> 
               <p>"Senora, have you never looked into your mirror, and beheld reflected there a form and face which are utterly unlike those to whom you were supposed to belong? Have you not looked into your soul, and found there impulses which were equally at war with theirs? Why, then, shall you be surprised to learn that you are not of the peasant race to which you have been supposed to belong?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes-that is true; I have long felt that I had few sympathies with those I was taught to consider as my relatives. But if not the child of Senora Marcante, to whom, then, do I belong?"</p> 
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6335-00000056"/> 
               <p>"That is a mystery which it remains with me to clear up, but not just yet. I promise you that I will follow up the clue in my possession, and endeavor to discover who the Italian lady was who came as a refugee to the hut of the fisherman, Marcante, who died there, and left her daughter to be reared as his own."</p> 
               <p>Clarice turned toward her friend with clasped hands and flashing eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Marie, hear this! Were not my conjectures true? Do you remember my words to you last night?"</p> 
               <p>"I do, and they are singularly confirmed. Senor Barnardo, will you enlighten us as to how you have made this discovery?"</p> 
               <p>"It is simple enough. Matra destroyed the agent who was sent to Isola Rossa to trace a lady and her child. He possessed himself of the directions given to this person, and came to the conviction in his own mind, that the Pearl of Isola Rossa was entitled to something more of this world's goods than her reputed mother could give her. Hence his determination to make her his wife at any sacrifice of feeling on her part."</p> 
               <p>"And the proofs of this?"</p> 
               <p>"Are in my possession," and Barnardo drew from his pocket the embossed casket in which Matra had displayed the papers to him on the previous night. He coolly explained:</p> 
               <p>"When Matra went forth to meet his bride, I entered his room and took possession of these: they afford me a clue to your family, Senora, which I shall diligently follow up till I am enabled to restore you to those to whom you rightfully belong."</p> 
               <p>Clarice instinctively clung more closely to her newly-wedded bridegroom, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"I belong now only to Guilio. Any claim that clashes with his will be repudiated by me. Can you tell me who and what I am?"</p> 
               <p>"To the latter question I can easily reply, Senora, for you are a most true and devoted woman, but the first must remain unanswered until proper investigations have proved your family to be what I suspect it-noble and wealthy."</p> 
               <p>"And you, who know so much, can you not unravel that also?"</p> 
               <p>"I only know that of which chance informed me, and I have imparted my knowledge to you to ease your mind of fears for the safety of those you have this day deserted."</p> 
               <p>Guilio had listened with painful eagerness to these revelations. He clasped the hand of his bride, and impetuously said:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Clarice! if I have marred your fate by linking it with mine! Yet I cannot give you up. If those who have a right to claim you should attempt to separate us, what would become of me?"</p> 
               <p>She regarded him reproachfully.</p> 
               <p>"If I were declared to be a princess to-morrow, I would refuse to accept both rank and fortune, unless they could be shared with you. I am yours in mind, soul and heart, and no artificial barrier shall ever arise to put asunder two whom God and nature have united forever."</p> 
               <p>Her pale cheeks flushed to the hue of the rose, and her clear eyes sought his with an expression of such tender devotion that Guilio could not doubt her perfect truth. With transport he exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my noble and true love! You shall never repent your trust in me while life is granted me to defend and protect you."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo's lip curled, and he cynically said:</p> 
               <p>"Wait till the trial comes, Senora, and then see in what spirit it will be met. Protestations pass for nothing till<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6335-00000057"/> temptation has tested them. Should you prove to be of high lineage and great wealth, how can you remain true to a mountain bandit, who would be repudiated by your family?"</p> 
               <p>Clarice calmly said:</p> 
               <p>"It is scarcely probable that I was born to so lofty a destiny, but if it should prove so, the very elevation of my rank and the independence of my fortune would enable me to lift my chosen one to my own level. I here declare my unalterable resolution to cling to Guilio through weal or woe, and to walk in the valley of humiliation with him sooner than soar even to the empyrean without him."</p> 
               <p>"You swear this?" asked Barnardo, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"I swear it, as I hope for salvation hereafter," was the solemn response.</p> 
               <p>Guilio with rapture caught her to his heart, murmuring thanks and blessings, and Barnardo, with a flashing glance of triumph, bade her remember and abide by her oath.</p> 
               <p>"That I shall surely do," Clarice proudly responded. "With me, love and duty walk hand in hand, and worldly distinctions shall never have power to sever them."</p> 
               <p>All that was noble and true in Barnardo was touched by this scene. In revealing so much of what he knew, he had been guided by an impulse that would not be controlled. He had not intended to betray his own agency in the assassination of Matra. His first design was to permit Guilio to bear the burden of the crime, but some chord in his better nature was touched by the devotion of these two untried hearts, and reckless equally of the past and the future, he resolved to assume the responsibility of Matra's murder, and leave them free from the claims of the Vendetta, to find such brief happiness as their union promised.</p> 
               <p>It was not his purpose to betray to Clarice the extent of his knowledge with regard to her family. No-he would first seek his detested foe, strike a deadly blow upon his pride, and then leave to him the task of revealing to the young bride the dire necessity of sacrificing the truest and tenderest love to the requirements of station. Yes-this devoted pair should have their dream. It could not last, but what <emph>does</emph> last in this world of change and suffering? A brief glimpse of happiness, as evanescent as the arrowy flash that plays upon the threatening cloud, is all that is vouchsafed to the most fortunate of earth's children.</p> 
               <p>One day of bliss at least these hopeful dreamers did enjoy, as cradled on that purple sea, the vessel glided smoothly toward her destination. They put the thought of Matra's tragic fate far from them, for they were Corsicans, and he had been slain in lawful vendetta by his foe; then wherefore should they grieve? The free hills should be their home, and for them love should wing the hours in harmony and peace.</p> 
               <p>The Violante kept within sight of the shore, and with every mile of her progress, some new beauty was unveiled in the island they had just left. Olive groves lined the shores, and from the deep umbrage of forest leaves gleamed the white walls of a chapel, or a villa, or the ostentatious mausoleums of the rich, crowned with cupolas, after a custom of the country.</p> 
               <p>Occasionally an abandoned watch-tower falling to ruins, with the wild vines of the forest trailing over its desolate walls, crowned some picturesque point from which a good lookout over the sea was once kept; for these structures were erected centuries ago by the different Italian governments which successively held sway over the island, to protect the coast from the invasion of the Saracens, and give warning of the approach of a hostile fleet.</p> 
               <p>On the other side, glowing in the radiant atmosphere, lay the islands of Elba, Caprea and Monte Christo, contrasted<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6335-00000058"/> with the lofty mountains and verdant valleys of their own beloved Corsica. On the slopes of the hills villages were nestled, the church always the most conspicuous building in them, from its lofty spire and the cloisters which were often attached to the sacred edifice. Shepherds pastured their flocks upon the verdant meadows, and wherever a valley opened toward the sea a watch-tower was sure to be found, guarding a deserted harbor in which a few small craft were at anchor.</p> 
               <p>By the care of Barnardo, fruits of luscious quality, and wine of a pure vintage, were offered to his guests beneath the awning on deck. The priest had preferred the companionship of the sailors below at their more substantial repast, and the four friends sat together and partook of the offered refreshments.</p> 
               <p>The position of Clarice was discussed, and every effort was made by Guilio to discover the full extent of Barnardo's information, but the caution of the latter baffled him completely. Not yet would he betray his secret, and he protested that he only possessed a clue which might lead him aright, or might yet baffle him. The captain professed the deepest interest in the happiness of the lovers, and pledged himself to do nothing toward separating them, let his investigations end as they might.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo possessed a subtle power of persuasion when he chose to exert it, and the two who now listened to him as to an oracle, believed that in him they had secured the best friend they had ever known. He pledged his word to visit Italy without delay, and seek there such information as would enable him to discover the family to which the young bride belonged. Then he would return to the pathless region of Niolo, in which lay the mountain home of the newly wedded pair.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo knew the character of that wild land, the eventless less solitude in which the greater portion of their existence must henceforth be passed, and he gazed with compassion upon this young girl, so full of life and passion, so gifted with beauty and fascination that even he, rugged as he was, could feel, and asked himself how long her resolution to abide by the man of her choice would endure amid the life of wild desolation she was about to embrace?</p> 
               <p>The wilderness of Monticino, lying between Tox and Mount St. Appiano, is covered with dark primitive forests, which have never resounded to the blows of the axe, and the whole country is overgrown with thickets of myrtle, scrub oak, and heaths so matted together as to be almost inaccessible.</p> 
               <p>Gloomy ravines through which the mountain torrent roars, offer precarious footing to the hapless outlaw who finds a home in the clefts of the rocks, and lives at war with every other man save his companions in misfortune. These rarely exceed two, for the Corsican bandits do not herd together in companies as do the banditti of other lands for predatory purposes. Theirs is a brotherhood of vengeance, not of spoil, and the wild freedom of their daily life is their only compensation for exile from friends and family.</p> 
               <p>To Clarice, who had passed her life under the stringent rule of Senora Marcante, there was something extremely captivating in the new existence opening before her. She revelled in the thought of solitude and freedom, with her adored Guilio as her protector, and Marie Montoni as her friend; for she intended to retain the latter near her, if it was possible to do so. She loved Guilio with one of those childish passions which made the sacrifice of all that women usually most covet seem light to her, if by giving her all she secured the privilege of being near him while life should be granted to her. She dreamed not that the hour could<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6335-00000059"/> ever arrive in which her heart would swerve from its allegiance. Strong in her self-confidence, Clarice defied temptation or weariness to change her toward her mountain chief; and in this belief she cradled her heart in happy dreams, and watched the gliding panorama with a sense of calm, unutterable happiness which was seldom a portion of her restless nature.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A FAIRY PALACE, AND AN EVIL GENIUS.</head> 
               <p>AS the sun was sinking toward the west in a flood of crimson glory, the Violante glided into a cove at the base of overhanging cliffs which seemed ready to topple down and bury the little craft in the waves below.</p> 
               <p>A figure appeared descending the rugged path, whose dress and air seemed singularly out of keeping with the desolate grandeur of the scene of which he formed a part. He was a man of remarkable personal beauty, of which he seemed perfectly conscious, for the striking style of his costume set it off to the best advantage. His tall, lithe figure was clad in a scarlet caftan richly embroidered with gold, beneath which appeared Moorish pantaloons; and his small feet were cased in boots of yellow morocco. On his head he wore a Spanish hat, with a long, drooping plume, which mingled with the curls of his raven hair. In his belt was stuck a pair of highly ornamented pistols, and a scimetar hung at his side.</p> 
               <p>The person who was thus imposingly attired was a man of twenty-eight or thirty, with a clear dark Italian complexion, through which the rich blood glowed upon the cheeks and lips with almost feminine beauty-a light moustache, daintily curled upward, revealed the delicate curve of a haughty lip, and the fire of the large dark eyes showed that however beautiful his person might be, he did not lack the nerve and daring of manhood.</p> 
               <p>The face was not noble, with all its statuesque beauty; but it possessed a wonderful power-a magnetic attraction that others felt without being able to analyze. When those intensely black eyes flashed with pride, or softened with love, those on whom they were bent felt a strange thrill tingling in every nerve of the body, and the old superstition of the evil eye involuntarily suggested itself to the mind. But this was soon lost sight of in the fascination of a manner which was equally the gift of his subtle organization.</p> 
               <p>When half way down the pathway, he paused as if uncertain of the propriety of approaching the strange vessel, for at a glance he saw that it was not the lugger of Guilio; but a signal from the deck reassured him, and he came as lightly and gracefully over the rough road as a boy of eighteen might have done. A bright smile flashed over his features as he saw Guilio standing upon the deck with a fair girl beside him. He knew that the object of the voyage had been accomplished, and with expressions of cordial greeting he advanced to the edge of the shore to meet the new-comers.</p> 
               <p>The vessel had scarcely touched the strand when Guilio sprang toward his friend, and grasping his hand with warmth, said:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Benedetto, you have been true to your promise, and all is in readiness for us. That you have assumed your gala dress to welcome us, is sufficient token of that. See my beautiful Clarice; is she not as lovely as an houri?"</p> 
               <p>As he spoke he drew forward the blushing girl, and placed her hand in that of the friend and companion of his<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6335-00000060"/> solitude, for such Benedetto had been to him for many months. Those deep eyes, with their fathomless power, were fixed upon the charming face of the young bride, and those of Clarice were raised to meet them; both started as their hands also met, conscious of a magnetic thrill which passed like a shock of lightning through the frame. With her it was almost repulsion-handsome as he was; with him it was a sudden intoxication-a bewildering delight at the presence of so enchanting a being, after being so long banished from the society of lovely and refined women. At least that was the solution of his emotion which Benedetto rendered to himself.</p> 
               <p>A deep flush mounted to his brow as he said, in a voice of singular depth and melody:</p> 
               <p>"Beautiful and bright as the angels of Heaven are represented, is the bride you have won, my Guilio. May you be happy with your queen of the mountains is my sincere prayer."</p> 
               <p>He lifted the hand he held to his lips, and pressed it lightly to them; again that electric shiver ran through her frame, and she shrank away as if some prescience from the future came with its shadowy folds to settle around her heart even on this her bridal day.</p> 
               <p>The name of Benedetto was familiar to her as that of the friend of Guilio during the past year-as one from whom the latter had learned much that was valuable to him; for the outlaw was an Italian who had mingled with the world of business, as well as that of letters; and he possessed the rare faculty of imparting to others the wealth of his own resources, without humiliating them by a consciousness of their own inferiority to himself. That he was only under a temporary cloud, and must at some future day return to his native land to resume the position from which he had been for a season hurled, Benedetto fully believed himself, and Guilio, with implicit faith, looked forward to the day which would restore his friend to his own.</p> 
               <p>At first Benedetto had opposed the marriage of Guilio because he feared it would interfere with the perfect freedom from restraint in which they lived in their mountain fastness; but when he found how strongly his friend's heart was set upon the village maiden, he consented to aid him with his cultivated taste and intimate knowledge of the habits of women, in preparing his home for the reception of his bride.</p> 
               <p>If this girl was mad enough to give up all that is ordinarily dear to woman, to lead the wild life of an outlaw's wife, why should he object-especially since her presence would give a charm and a variety to the cavern they inhabited, which it sadly lacked? Thus reasoned Benedetto, and now, in his deep heart, he congratulated himself that this lovely waif had been cast, as it were, at his feet; beneath the power of that imperious nature which hitherto had carried all resistance before it, for this dangerous man truly boasted that he had never failed to win anything on which he had once set his heart.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo and Marie were presented to him, and after a few graceful words to each, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I have been waiting your arrival for the last hour. Our mules are safely secured behind the bushes, and we can soon mount to the Eagle's Nest, where everything is prepared for your reception, Senora, in the best style our means afford."</p> 
               <p>"I doubt not I shall be charmed with my new home, and its surroundings," replied Clarice, with a blush she would have given much to repress, but the tell-tale blood would leap to her cheek in spite of her efforts to be perfectly unmoved.</p> 
               <p>Benedetto merely bowed, and turned to Barnardo:</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6335-00000061"/> 
               <p>"Senor, I salute you, and I remember you well. Your vessel once afforded me shelter when the sbirri were on my track, and I shall not speedily forget you for the service you then rendered me."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo fixed his eagle glance upon him as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I remember; you came on board at Naples, just as we were leaving the harbor, and paid me nobly to refuse to return at the command of the police. It was not my business to inquire the cause of their anxiety to secure you, so I brought you to this coast, and landed you here at your own request. Have you remained with Guilio Falcone from that time?"</p> 
               <p>"I have not returned to Italy," replied Benedetto, significantly, "and my time has been chiefly spent in these mountain solitudes. You did not suffer for your kindness to me, I hope."</p> 
               <p>"Not seriously; there was some little investigation made on my return to Italy, but I found means to satisfy the authorities," replied Barnardo, carelessly.</p> 
               <p>Benedetto regarded him with a glance that seemed piercing enough to read his very soul, but the impassive air assumed by the captain baffled him. He slightly frowned as he said:</p> 
               <p>"It was well; there was no cause why you should have been held to account for befriending me. I had done nothing to merit arrest."</p> 
               <p>While they thus spoke together, several mules, gaily decorated with streamers of ribbon, were brought from the shelter of the thicket, and Clarice and her friend mounted without delay. After many thanks to Barnardo for the services he had rendered them, they took their leave of him with the assurance on his part that within a month he would return with some definite information concerning the family of Clarice. The crew of the Violante assembled on deck, and gave the travellers a parting cheer, which roused the echoes of the cliffs, and died away in long swells of sound. A few moments afterward, the light craft glided from her moorings, and skimmed as a white-winged bird toward Caprea.</p> 
               <p>The travellers commenced the ascent of the mountain path that wound around the side of the cliffs, but the last words of Barnardo had cast a chill over the susceptible heart of Clarice. He said to Guilio:</p> 
               <p>"In your quiet nest be as happy as you can, for no man knows when the end of his joy will come."</p> 
               <p>She replied by a look of confiding love toward her lover, and waving a graceful adieu to the captain of the smuggling craft, made the sign of the cross in the Corsican fashion by crossing her thumbs, and then inclined her head toward Guilio, with an expression that plainly said:</p> 
               <p>"I am his in life and death; beware how you permit any one to attempt to divide us."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo turned away, muttering:</p> 
               <p>"Poor girl! she believes it now, but who can tell how she will bear the sad life before her? The time may come when she will be glad to escape from it, even without the temptation that will surely assail her. Now for mine ancient <emph>friend,</emph> to breathe into his ear a tale that will crush his towering pride to the dust; and make me feel that my vow of retribution has been fulfilled. Ho! Ernesti, now has my turn come, and sternly will I anatomize your heart, and see wherein it is accessible to human suffering."</p> 
               <p>The road taken by the bridal cortge soon struck into a gorge closed in by mountain ridges on either side, through which roared a rapid stream, its waters flashing over impediments of rock, and sending forth jets of spray in its impetuous progress toward the sea. The sure-footed mules moved along a narrow and precipitous ledge, which often<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6335-00000062"/> overhung the abyss in the most frightful manner. Guilio held the bridle of Clarice, and sustained her by frequent words of encouragement, while Benedetto, with careless grace, performed the same service for Marie, who rode along like one in a vague dream, thinking of a far-distant time when she had thus ridden over mountain paths, escorted by the beloved one who now belonged to another sphere of existence, while she wandered on in desolation.</p> 
               <p>Marie was not envious of the happiness of the two who had just plighted themselves to each other, but she could not repress a sigh when she contrasted her own lonely and blighted existence with the united faith of those devoted lovers, happy with each other in spite of the frowns of fortune.</p> 
               <p>Gradually the path opened upon a forest of pines and larches-the broad, tassel-like crowns of the former, and the gnarled and knotty trunks of the latter, affording a picturesque contrast. An undergrowth of blossoming myrtle, boxwood, and erika, spread their balmy odors upon the atmosphere. Clarice expressed her delight at this prospect; but the scene soon changed again, and the monotonous rush of water, and the screaming of falcons, was alone heard amid the rugged mountain hights toward which they approached. The change in the temperature caused the young girl to shiver, and Guilio tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"A few more turns, my love, and we shall be at the end of our journey. Then my Clarice will behold the unique home I have prepared for her reception."</p> 
               <p>She smiled brightly, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"My heart is not chilled, Guilio, though the mountain air feels keen to my bosom. With you by my side, its sharpness is more welcome than the soft breezes of Isola Rossa when breathed alone. Oh! Guilio, we shall be very happy in our mountain solitude."</p> 
                
               <p>"I trust so, my angel. I should be wretehed indeed if you found the exchange you have made an unhappy one."</p> 
               <p>"Have no fears of that, my Guilio. I have no hope that is not centred in you; no joy can come to me unshared by you."</p> 
               <p>"And I ask no higher fate than the power to make you happy. God will surely be good to two young creatures like you and me, who only ask to live a united and contented life."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Guilio; I truly believe He will send his blessing upon us, for we have done no evil to any one, nor wished harm to any living creature. The blood that was shed to-day was not at our command, and retributive justice will exact from us no penance for it. Speak, Guilio, will it not be so?"</p> 
               <p>"I surely believe it will. Man may seek to do us evil; but God, who knows the truth, will protect us from their wrath. Let us be happy, Clarice, and put far from us all care and regret. This is the summer of our life and joy, and if we do not make the most of its sunshine, life will afford us no equivalent for its loss."</p> 
               <p>"True, love. I give myself up to happiness and peace, for in our secluded home we shall certainly be able to command the last. Isolated from the outside world, in each other we shall find all that is necessary to our perfect content."</p> 
               <p>Thus in the egotism of their love they prattled as they travelled onward. Suddenly the shrill whistle of a goatherd echoed through the ravine, and a tall, shaggy-looking figure, dressed in the brown woollen cloth manufactured on the island, bounded into the path before them. He took off a red woollen cap, finished with a heavy black tassel, and bowing lowly before the two, said:</p> 
               <p>"Welcome to the King of the Mountains and his fair<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6335-00000063"/> Queen! Angelo, the humblest of his friends, offers them the homage of his loyal heart."</p> 
               <p>Guilio held out his hand cordially as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Many thanks, my faithful Angelo. My queen will soon learn to appreciate so true a heart as yours at its full value."</p> 
               <p>Clarice also placed her delicate hand in the rough clasp of the shepherd, who lifted it toward his lips, but with a delicacy scarcely to be expected from him, refrained from pressing them upon it.</p> 
               <p>As Angelo turned upon the path, and preceded them with light and agile tread, Guilio explained that a portion of his fortune consisted of flocks of goats and sheep, of which Angelo was the herdsman, while his wife was the housekeeper and manager of the domestic affairs of his wild home.</p> 
               <p>They rode slowly forward to a point from which the path suddenly descended toward the brink of a rapid stream which leaped down a ravine several hundred feet in depth. The crags had been splintered by the force of the torrent, and huge rocks lay piled in Titanic confusion around.</p> 
               <p>Over this scene of wild grandeur the impenetrable forest threw its dense shade, the mountain pines and larches which grew on opposite sides of the chasm nearly meeting overhead. The rays of a fire flashed out upon this gloom, and looking toward it, Clarice beheld the entrance to a vast cavern which seemed to have been hollowed from huge blocks of granite by some terrible convulsion of nature.</p> 
               <p>The wide entrance revealed the overhanging roof blackened by the smoke which curled in faint spiral wreaths around the rugged walls, seeking some avenue of escape. Beside a bright fire sat a middle-aged woman in a blue dress faced with scarlet, and a gay-looking head-handkerchief worn as a mandille, or turban, around her head. A cradle with a sleeping infant in it was placed near her, and her air of watchfulness plainly indicated that she was looking for the return of her husband, accompanied by the travellers.</p> 
               <p>At the sound of their approach she started up, and came forward to take a first look at her new mistress, not without a feeling of repulsion at the thought of owing allegiance to one, but the sweet, girlish face that met her flashing black eyes reassured her, though her brow again clouded as she saw Marie Montoni dismount, and accompany Clarice when she entered the cavern.</p> 
               <p>The two paused in astonishment at its unusual extent, for the rude and sombre walls swept back in the distance to what seemed an almost interminable extent, and bright eyes, like sparks of light, gleamed from every crevice. For an instant Clarice was appalled at what seemed to her something supernatural, but Guilio hastened to explain that those shining orbs belonged to the animals which were huddled at night into the dark recesses found in this vestibule to the temple she was henceforth to inhabit.</p> 
               <p>"Lisa makes cheese from their milk," he added, "and you will find her a most excellent manager."</p> 
               <p>Thus extolled, the woman came forward with a more gracious air, and offered welcome and congratulations to her employer and his bride. She took a rude lamp from a shelving rock, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me show the Queen of the Mountains to her regal home. It was built by the gods, and is grander than any palace made by the hands of man."</p> 
               <p>At these words the two strangers looked around the dismal sheep-fold, and wondered if this was indeed to prove an ante-chamber to an Aladdin's palace, and rather repelled by glimpses of the imperfectly lighted recesses from which eyes gazed upon them in meek wonder, rendered so luminous<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6335-00000064"/> ous by the light that flashed upon them as to be almost terrible to an imaginative person. To such the cavern might have typified Hades, with the eyes of accusing spirits bent in reproach upon those who entered its shades.</p> 
               <p>Guilio and Benedetto offered each an arm to his charge, and the former whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Keep up your courage, love, for this is not like our dwelling-place."</p> 
               <p>Following the lead of Lisa, the party wound through a narrow pathway worn in the rock, and at length stopped in front of what seemed to the strangers a portion of the solid wall. The woman flared the light before it, and said, in a tone of triumph:</p> 
               <p>"Look well, Senora, and judge if the sbirri are likely to find those who seek a refuge in these walls? Can you see any means of ingress? See-see how solid it seems," and she held the lamp close to the dark, precipitous walls of rock, over which tiny jets of water slowly trickled.</p> 
               <p>Clarice examined the dreary looking walls, and faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"I see nothing that indicates a passage, but I suppose there must be a concealed entrance to the apartments beyond."</p> 
               <p>"You may well say that, Senora. Yes, yes, there are rooms fit for a queen to inhabit. You shall see-you shall see. Look, now, what a Titan my good man is."</p> 
               <p>Angelo, with a gay laugh, raised his arm, and pressed with all his force upon a spring concealed behind a jutting point of rock. A square frame filled in with earth and stones, in exact imitation of that which surrounded it, fell back, revealing a narrow defile lighted by a swinging lamp. This passage was about ten feet long, and opened into a second room, the jagged sides of which were made to serve as rude shelves, on which rested vessels filled with milk, and many round cheeses placed upon freshly gathered leaves.</p> 
               <p>Lisa waved her hand in triumph toward these evidences of her thrift and good management, and said:</p> 
               <p>"The Senora sees that I understand my business, and that the interests of the master do not suffer in our hands. Angelo herds the sheep and goats, and helps me to milk them, but I make the cheeses that are sold in the markets in the valley. In the days of King Theodore, tribute was levied upon the people below, but now we manage to make a living without that, though we do break the laws by giving aid and protection to those who flee from the blood vengeance."</p> 
               <p>Clarice smiled as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I have no doubt of your industry and capacity, good Lisa, and I trust that we shall soon learn mutually to understand and value each other."</p> 
               <p>The woman tossed her head with an expression of doubt, and walked forward to a second wall, apparently as impenetrable as the one through which they had lately passed. Before this Angelo kneeled, and pressed his strong hand upon the floor. An irregularly shaped stone slowly lifted itself, and a flight of rude steps cut in the solid rock was before them; Angelo took the lamp from his wife's hand, and went down to the first winding, and then turning, threw the light backward to guide them in their progress.</p> 
               <p>Guilio gently said:</p> 
               <p>"Come, my Clarice, the way is rough, but it leads to our bower of bliss, and you will soon see that I have a dainty cage in which to place my dove of peace."</p> 
               <p>She smiled serenely, for such was her confidence in Guilio, that the heart of Clarice did not falter as she descended the dark and dreary-looking staircase. Her<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6335-00000065"/> lover almost lifted her tender feet from the rugged stones as he stepped over them with firm, familiar tread, and at every turning their guide halted, and held the light till the others stood around him.</p> 
               <p>In this manner they descended about thirty steps, which terminated in a grotto filled with stalactites, on which the light threw brilliant prismatic hues.</p> 
               <p>An exclamation of delight burst from the lips of Clarice, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"It is the ante-chamber of the fairies. See how beautiful are those fluted columns wreathed with flowers."</p> 
               <p>Guilio smiled with triumphant pleasure.</p> 
               <p>"This is nothing, my love, to the beauties beyond. Let us waste no time in examining what is so inferior to that which is to come. Open, Angelo, and let my queen behold her domain."</p> 
               <p>At his command, the wall behind an irregular arch of white, glittering spar, slid back, revealing the interior of what seemed indeed to be a fairy palace brilliantly illuminated by concealed lamps.</p> 
               <p>There seemed to be a suite of apartments communicating with each other, the divisions being made by heavy crimson drapery, which was now drawn back and held in loose folds by thick silken cords.</p> 
               <p>The first apartment was about sixty feet in length, filled with pointed arches, massive capitals, and delicate carvings, such as might have been designed by some gothic architect in a moment of inspired frenzy. A cross and prayer-book lay upon an altar of irregular shape, but most exquisitely adorned, and the ivory from which the crucifix had been sculptured with much labor by human ingenuity, looked yellow and discolored beside the brilliant spar of which the altar was composed.</p> 
               <p>This was indeed a temple not made with hands, most worthy of dedication to the Supreme Architect who, in the silence of ages, had thus fashioned and adorned it. Moved by the same impulse, Clarice and Marie kneeled before the altar, and repeated a prayer. They then arose, and with vivid interest prepared to follow Guilio, who had dismissed Angelo and his wife, and himself assumed the office of cicerone.</p> 
               <p>He lifted the prayer-book, and reverently said:</p> 
               <p>"This was once my mother's. The cross also belonged to her, and I have placed them here as fit offerings for my wife."</p> 
               <p>Clarice pressed her lips to the sacred emblem, and said, with tender emotion:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my Guilio, they shall be treasured as relics, and used with reverence."</p> 
               <p>"Let us go on, for the day draws to a close, and I wish to reveal to you all the wonders of your elfin palace before it becomes night."</p> 
               <p>"Day and night are of little consequence here, for we must live by lamplight," said Marie, looking around the brilliantly lighted chapel.</p> 
               <p>Guilio smiled mysteriously, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Come and see."</p> 
               <p>They passed beneath the folds of drapery into a circular room, with irregular columns, ornamented with every fantastic device the imagination can conceive, grouped in such a manner as best to sustain the arched dome above, while the artistic eye was gratified by their chance arrangement.</p> 
               <p>A recess between two of these was draped with rose-colored silk, over which hung lace curtains, partially concealing a bed with a snowy covering upon it. A tablet, which reared its glittering form close beside it, was converted into a dressing-table, and a mirror with an ebony frame hung above it. Crimson cushions were piled in every recess to<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6335-00000066"/> be used as seats when needed; and a large coffer, ornamented with steel, stood at the foot of the bed. Guilio lifted the lid of this to show Clarice the wardrobe he had caused to be prepared for her use, and her vain little heart bounded at the sight of silks, laces and jewels, such as she had never believed herself born to wear. She was but a young and untried girl, conscious of possessing remarkable beauty, to which the aids of the toilette must give added power to charm; and who can blame her innocent joy in the possession of a beautiful wardrobe? She spoke, with rapture:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Guilio, I am indeed as happy as a queen! I seem to be walking in a delightful dream."</p> 
               <p>"Which I trust will end in a waking reality of perfect bliss, my precious Clarice. If you are only happy here, all my care will be rewarded."</p> 
               <p>"Happy! ah! if I am not so, I shall prove myself an ingrate."</p> 
               <p>Guilio kissed her hand, and then lifted a curtain that had not been fastened back like the others. This afforded a glimpse of a smaller apartment, which had been prepared as a dressing-room, and a lounge was placed within it.</p> 
               <p>"This," he said, "must be given to Marie as her bower of rest till a chamber can be prepared for her. Now we will pass to our dining and reception room."</p> 
               <p>A passage about six feet in width, descended slightly a few yards, and terminated in an irregular rotunda; in this there was a large fissure overhead, through which the light of day penetrated into the cavern. Immediately beneath it stood a table covered with a white cloth, on which fruits, bread and wine were placed.</p> 
               <p>Wild vines from without had made their way through the opening in the roof, and spread their clinging arms over the precipitous sides of the cavern, till it presented a mass of verdure and flowers, whose subtle perfume filled the atmosphere. Four chairs were placed around the table, and Guilio led his bride to the seat of honor at its head, and then placed himself opposite to her. Benedetto and Marie took the places on either side, both smiling and amused observers of the innocent delight of Clarice at the novel and unexpected splendor that surrounded her. Yet the two were moved by very different feelings. Marie Montoni enjoyed her surprise, and augured well for her future happiness from this auspicious beginning; but the companion of Guilio had in his heart already forsworn all allegiance to the friendship which had so lately united them.</p> 
               <p>A passion as violent as it was uncontrollable had sprung into sudden existence, and he watched the lovely being before him with his fathomless eyes, resolute to read the secret of her nature, and bring all its hidden impulses of vanity and pride to aid him in the treachery his heart had already matured.</p> 
               <p>But in spite of this the smile of Benedetto was not less frequent, nor his wit less pleasant than Guilio had hitherto found them. As they seated themselves he took up a bottle, struck off its head, and poured the red wine into Venetian glasses, which stood ready to receive it. Then with a low reverence to Clarice, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Welcome, and happiness to the Pearl of Isola Rossa, now it is transferred to its granite setting. May she never wish to exchange her diadem as Mountain Queen, for the bonnet of the Parisian dame."</p> 
               <p>While Benedetto thus spoke, Guilio lifted a wreath of the laurel-rose, which lay upon a basket of luscious-looking grapes, and placed it upon the brow of Clarice. She blushed and smiled brightly, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I should scarcely gain by such an exchange, Senor, and I accept the only kingdom over which I am ambitious to<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6335-00000067"/> reign-that of Guilio's heart and home. I have made my choice, and will abide by it to the last, let what will befall me. I pledge you in this wine, Guilio, and give you leave to match its ruby hue with the life-blood from my heart, when it proves false to you."</p> 
               <p>"I accept your pledge!" exclaimed Guilio, with enthusiasm; and the true Corsican spirit flashed from his eyes as he put forth his hand, and clasped the delicate one extended to him across the table.</p> 
               <p>Marie spoke with much emotion, and she became deadly pale as her eyes fixed in a kind of tranced horror upon some vision that flitted before her.</p> 
               <p>"Forbear! forbear! It makes my heart quiver to hear you speak thus. Clarice, give him no such right; the heart may change-who knows? but the life, the life, belongs only to the God who gave it. 'Tis not yours to pledge, nor his to take. Beware what you do, for I see-I see stretching before me a vista that-"</p> 
               <p>She paused convulsively, and covered her eyes with her hands. Clarice imperiously spoke:</p> 
               <p>"Silence, Marie. I will have no croaking on this my bridal day. Look at this yellow flower, which blooms against the wall; it is the sympathetic helianthus; and when a single twig is torn away, all the blossoms drop from it. It is a type of my life; torn from Guilio, every hope, every joy would perish, and my life-blood may flow at his command when the heart it animates proves treacherous to him."</p> 
               <p>Marie could say no more, but her pallor became more deadly, and she sank back with closed eyes and clasped hands.</p> 
               <p>Benedetto watched her with strange interest. He was aware that among the common people she was regarded as a kind of seeress, and although by nature skeptical, he was curious to learn what her gift of second sight enabled her to behold in the future of Clarice. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Senora Montoni, you have blanched the cheek of our fair bride, and have caused Guilio's heart to feel its first jealous <unclear>pang</unclear>, by hinting a doubt of her fidelity to one she has braved so much to join. Surely your familiar spirit must deceive you. Speak-do away with the sad impression your words have made."</p> 
               <p>With a convulsive sigh, Marie aroused herself from her semi-trance, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Come, let us eat, drink, and be merry. Do not heed me; I am only a bird of evil omen, and not fit to sit at bridal feasts. But for the loneliness of Clarice without me, I should not have come hither; let not my sadness mar the joy of this hour, which should be dedicated to the union of two devoted hearts. Give me wine, wine, that I may pledge you. I drink the ruby nectar, and may its crimson hue be matched by that of the life-blood of the heart that proves recreant to its vows. Yes-such is the irrevocable decree of fate."</p> 
               <p>There was a wild glitter in her eyes, and a feverish restlessness in her manner, as she snatched the goblet and quaffed its contents. Clarice looked earnestly at her, and a thrilling feeling of fear and foreboding entered her heart. She asked her secret soul, if after all she had misinterpreted her own nature? Could time or circumstance so change her, that she could ever become untrue to the present idol of her heart? Impossible! Away with such thoughts. It was treason to dream of such sacrilege toward the religion of her heart, her intense devotion to her beloved Guilio."</p> 
               <p>Yet with all this self-confidence, Clarice was but seventeen, and the woman's nature lay folded in the germ of the girl's heart. Into what it might develop remained to be proved in the future. For the present let her dream<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6335-00000068"/> remain unbroken. She loved-was beloved in return, and that must suffice.</p> 
               <p>A look of such tender confidence passed between the lately wedded lovers, as showed how little they apprehended change or estrangement. With a smile radiant with her newly-found happiness, Clarice said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us partake of our bridal feast, Guilio, without permitting an ominous shadow to fall over us. We have endured enough to obtain the felicity of being united, so let us enjoy the certainty of our present bliss."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," murmured Marie, vaguely. "Enjoy it, my beloved Clarice; pardon me, and forget what I have said. A strange cloud falls over me at moments, and I speak without sufficient thought. Your nature is true and noble, then wherefore should I doubt your future?"</p> 
               <p>With the exquisite tact which was the birthright of the fair bride, she glided into sprightly conversation, and performed the honors of the table so gracefully that the momentary cloud soon passed away, and their hearts were tuned anew to enjoyment. As they arose from the repast, Guilio said:</p> 
               <p>"And now I will show you the crowning wonder of my subterranean home. Follow, and behold."</p> 
               <p>He turned toward a recess at the back of his seat, and lifting the heavy screen of matted vines which fell to the floor, revealed a door concealed behind them. This opened at his touch, and a narrow passage with large recesses on either side, which seemed to be used as storehouses, descended abruptly about twenty feet to a rocky platform which jutted over the sea, thus affording a wide view over its waters, stretching away toward the opposite coast of Italy. In the rear, the mountain peaks rose so abruptly as completely to isolate this little lookout, and from below, the beetling crags projected over the water in such a manner as to preclude all possibility of access from the sea below, which dashed its vexed waters against the granite cliffs with a continuous roar that came with softened echoes to the spot on which they stood.</p> 
               <p>The white sails of vessels gleamed upon the purple waves over which the evening sun was setting in all the golden radiance of an Italian sky; Guilio pointed to a felucca in the distance, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Yonder flies the Violante; Barnardo has lost no time in going on his voyage."</p> 
               <p>Clarice kissed her hand, and wafted it toward the vessel as she spoke with enthusiasm:</p> 
               <p>"May a blessing go with him for his kindness to us. Ah, dear Guilio, this is a paradise to which he has been instrumental in transporting me. How have you been able to keep your secret so well as to take me so completely by surprise?"</p> 
               <p>Her lover smiled fondly on her, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I wished to woo you as one of your own caste; then show you all the beauty of my lonely home, and reveal to you that I am rich enough to support you in comfort; aye, even in a species of barbarian luxury, if you can school your mind to the solitude in which we must live. Benedetto is my comrade and sworn friend-Marie is yours; beside these we shall see no one, except Angelo and his wife, when their services are needed."</p> 
               <p>"That will be charming! I shall enjoy this life of love and seclusion above all things."</p> 
               <p>"I hope so," he seriously said; "for I shall be wretched if it should prove otherwise. But I have not yet revealed to you all the mysteries of our singular abode. Here we are completely isolated from the outside world, for nothing can reach us from without, unless a balloon should poise itself above us and drop down upon our platform. From a concealed<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6335-00000069"/> cealed entrance to one of the caverns we passed in coming hither, opens a narrow path, by which escape to the hills above may be secured, if, by any chance, the situation of the cave should be betrayed. From another of them winds a flight of steps-cut in the rock, ages ago, by some barbarian invader-which lead to a submarine grotto of such marvellous beauty as will make all the adornments of our cavern seem poor and commonplace in comparison."</p> 
               <p>"Let us visit it at once," said Clarice, eagerly. "Can we not go without delay?"</p> 
               <p>"It is too late now, my love, and the events of this busy day have already wearied you and your friend sufficiently. You will be compelled to descend a rough passage several hundred feet before we reach the sea, over a road by no means adapted to ladies' feet. To-morrow you will be rested and refreshed, and then we will go below."</p> 
               <p>"To-morrow let it be then. I shall begin to believe myself indeed a mountain queen, and to love with more intense devotion the dear hand that bestows so much upon me."</p> 
               <p>She took his hand, and would have lifted it to her lips, but Guilio imprisoned both her own and kissed them playfully. Clarice blushed and struggled to free them, and, in so doing she caught the expression of Benedetto's face, as he looked upon this little by-play with a fiery gleam in his black eyes, that thrilled her soul with a nameless dread. She fervently wished that this man was not upon her path, though she could not have explained to herself why she feared him, and a sudden chill fell over the warm exuberance of her feelings. She drew her hands from the clasp of Guilio's, and stood calm and collected beside him.</p> 
               <p>After a pause she said:</p> 
               <p>"If there is an outlet toward the hills, we can sometimes walk on terra firma."</p> 
                
               <p>"Oh, yes; every path in this vicinity is well known to me, and it shall be my pleasure to introduce you to them. I will teach you how to use a light carbine which my mother once carried, and we will share our pastimes together."</p> 
               <p>"That will be charming. Yes-I feel that I was formed for this wild, free life, and with you for my guide and companion, I shall be truly blessed among women."</p> 
               <p>"Yet, senora," said Benedetto, with a touch of sarcasm in his tones, "I should say that so rare and delicate a creature as yourself would flourish far better in the perfumed atmosphere that surrounds a court. The highest civilization alone deserves to claim such beauty as yours; and a spirit so capable of asserting itself, and maintaining its true position, should have a sphere befitting its loftiest aspirations. If you hope to confine a soul of fire, such as I see in you, to the narrow boundaries of this cavern, you understand yourself but little."</p> 
               <p>With an expression of chilling reserve, the young bride replied:</p> 
               <p>"You misjudge me, senor. Time proves all things; among the rest, its progress will show you that I have read my own heart aright, and found through its teachings, that exceeding love sufficeth for all things to those who are capable of feeling it."</p> 
               <p>Benedetto bowed lowly before her, as if convinced by her words; but in his heart lay folded the purpose to test the strength of that love, and assure himself that it was indeed a shield of adamant against his subtle power.</p> 
               <p>Clarice turned to Guilio and quickly said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us go in; I feel the chill of the evening air, and Marie is actually shivering."</p> 
               <p>Guilio offered her his hand to guide her steps, and followed by the others they soon regained the dining-hall. During<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6335-00000070"/> their absence the table had been cleared, and by the light of a lamp suspended from a projecting cornice, Clarice saw that the national dish broccio was served for their supper. This is a species of flat, white cake, made from coagulated goat's milk, which on this occasion was eaten with wine and sugar. After tasting and commending the delicate preparation, Clarice said:</p> 
               <p>"What fairy played the part of waiting maid in our absence? I hope Lisa does not have to descend those dreadful stairs every time she is wanted here?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no; the hill entrance is known to Lisa, and her own apartments are near it. She comes by that way to attend to her domestic duties."</p> 
               <p>When supper was over, Clarice and her friend retired to the inner chamber, while the two comrades lit their long, Turkish pipes, and talked over the late incidents in which they were interested.</p> 
               <p>Of course, the two girls made a thorough exploration of the apartment of Clarice, and everything in it was duly admired by those who took so keen a personal interest in all its details. In their progress, a mandolin in excellent tune was found, and Marie touched it with her usual skill, accompanying the music occasionally with her voice in a strange, wild chant, improvised as she proceeded.</p> 
               <p>The echoes caught up the strain, and filled the lofty columned recesses with weird and thrilling melody, that seemed to die in the distance in faint swells of music, as if the spirits of the air were bearing it away upon their viewless wings.</p> 
               <p>Clarice heard and thoroughly enjoyed the grand refrain, but she paid no heed to the words, for her mind and heart were too deeply occupied with reviewing the incidents of the day; and she devoutly returned thanks to heaven for her great happiness in escaping the odious love of Matra, to be elevated to the position in which she was now placed.</p> 
                
               <p>Ambition, the sin for which angels fell, was a leading trait in her character, and she thought with triumph that her love for the lowly fisherman had given her to one she considered so far above the station she had lately occupied. She thought of those she had abandoned forever to follow him, and she rejoiced that Senora Marcante's family possessed no claim upon her, that she was free to follow her mountain lord whither fate might lead her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A PATRICIAN HOME, AND ITS GLOOMY MASTER.</head> 
               <p>THE scene changes to the vicinity of Genoa, once the proud, now the fallen, but still a noble Italian city. The residence of the ancient family of Ernesti was no modern villa, but a castle of the middle ages, built upon the side of a hill which overlooked the sea; and the grounds in the rear of the mansion were terraced to its summit. From this point, the scene was grand and beautiful, for it commanded a view of the shore beneath, dotted with picturesque villages; with the gleaming waters of the bay stretching off into the open sea, while in the far distance the snow-crowned Alps reared their summits toward Heaven, glittering in every variety of light and shadow.</p> 
               <p>The castle was approached through an avenue lined with boxwood hedges, and shaded by rows of magnificent trees, which opened upon a circular area adorned with statuary, and filled with lemon and orange trees, bearing both fruit and flowers. From this a grape trellis stretched to the foot of a flight of marble steps leading into the first floor of the immense pile, which bore upon its mildewed surface the evidence of its own antiquity.</p> 
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6335-00000071"/> 
               <p>The grounds were not devoted alone to ornamental purposes, for on the wide terraces, grape covered walks extended in every direction, offering both shade and fruit to those who paused to rest upon the seats of sculptured stone placed at convenient intervals among them.</p> 
               <p>From a wide entrance hall with a tesselated pavement, a second flight of marble steps led upward to a grand reception-room, ornamented with old paintings, heir-looms in the ancient family of the Ernesti; and stately rooms filled with antique carved furniture, and gilded hangings, carried the imagination back to the days of grand old emprise and renown, when stately dames and lordly chevaliers held their revels in those walls.</p> 
               <p>Now the silence of desolation reigned over this grand old pile, for no voice of mirth was ever heard within its halls, and joyless had been the existence of its lonely master for many, many years. Yet everything was kept in the most rigid order. The servants glided like spectres upon their silent rounds of duty, attending with scrupulous care to the commands of a stern and exacting master, who tolerated no laxity of discipline among those under his control.</p> 
               <p>Like most men of his high rank, Count Ernesti had served in the army in early life, and in his retirement he carried with him the habits of the military martinet. He had lived almost alone for years, wrapped in his pride of station, and the misanthropy which had been the offspring of events he shuddered to recall, yet which he could never cast into oblivion, for conscience will at times make cowards of us all.</p> 
               <p>A chapel, upon whose shrine many votive offerings were laid by the stern lord of the castle, occupied one wing of the building; and a white-haired priest, now very infirm from years, had a suite of rooms allotted to him, and a pension from the count for officiating at its altar. Yet the two men rarely met; at stated intervals, Ernesti confessed to Father Gregory, received his absolution, and parted from him in solemn silence.</p> 
               <p>The repentant man and the simple-hearted priest had little in common, and they did not attempt to play a part toward each other. Self-sustained and stern, Count Ernesti asked neither for sympathy nor compassion; his pride was as indomitable as the granite hills on which his castle stood, and Prometheus-like he could feel the vulture gnawing at his heart without betraying to the looker-on the anguish he endured.</p> 
               <p>In early life this man had been impulsive, impassioned, and romantic; though his best qualities were marred by a vein of cruelty which is too often found among his countrymen. Harsh and hard things were whispered about him, and it was even asserted that crime had darkened the days of his youth, for which he was now bearing a lifelong penance. Let his misdeeds have been what they might, Count Ernesti was atoning for them in the silence and desolation of a life as joyless as that of the monks of La Trappe.</p> 
               <p>In the wing of the castle opposite to that which contained the chapel, was a suite of rooms occupied by the master, and there, severed from sympathy or association, Count Ernesti passed the days of his weary life. His sitting-room, in which his meals were usually served, was fitted up with extreme simplicity; and in it were found only such articles of furniture as were absolutely necessary for daily use.</p> 
               <p>The library, which joined this apartment, was a large, shadowy-looking room, with windows opening to the floor, and heavy carved bookcases filled with volumes in every modern language, and on every conceivable subject, either of science, literature, or art.</p> 
               <p>Beyond this, was a room which no footstep save his own ever entered; and he only sought it on days of humiliation<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6335-00000072"/> and confession, when tears of blood were wept within its seclusion.</p> 
               <p>Yet there was nothing rich or grand in that simple apartment. It only contained the humble furniture from a peasant's cottage, which had evidently seen good service, for it was worn and scarred in many places.</p> 
               <p>In contrast with its meanness, was a magnificent inlaid dressing-case, on which the name of Ginevra was enamelled in gold; this was placed upon a stand of common wood, with drawers, which were pulled open by steel rings. In place of the mirror, which seemed to have been broken, a portrait hung over it in such a position as to give the figure it represented the appearance of bending forward in an attitude of supplication.</p> 
               <p>This idea was carried out by the imploring expression of the face and the clasped hands of the dark-eyed girl it represented. She wore the costume of a peasant, and the white muslin mesure worn by the lower orders of Genoese women, in place of a bonnet, was laid in soft folds upon her shining black hair, and descending thence in flowing lines, was gathered with natural grace over the neck and shoulders in the form of a shawl.</p> 
               <p>The face was singularly lovely, but in spite of its pleading expression, both will and the power of resistance were seen in the curves of the red lips, and in the veiled fire of the deep dark eyes. They revealed a nature that would bear much, but once aroused to desperation, she would be capable of any sacrifice sooner than bow the pride of her soul before her oppressor.</p> 
               <p>A decaying shutter permitted a ray of sunshine to penetrate the dim room, and it played in golden light upon the head of the portrait, lingering as a halo around its exquisite loveliness. At that instant the door of the apartment slowly unclosed, and feet that seemed reluctant to perform their allotted penance, crossed its threshold. The visitor paused, and looked slowly around, and he started as his eyes fell upon the illuminated face, whose speaking eyes looked into his own with that imploring expression so long since stamped upon his heart in living characters of fire.</p> 
               <p>Count Ernesti, with pale lips, muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Ah! how like, how fatally like that fascinating serpent, who bent but to conquer. Oh, Ginevra, Ginevra, loved beyond expression, punished beyond example, whither, whither didst thou flee to baffle me so completely? Years have merged in the vast sea of eternity since that fatal night, and no clue is yet fonnd-none! none!"</p> 
               <p>The speaker sank upon his knees in front of the picture, and clasped his hands in an attitude of passionate anguish.</p> 
               <p>Count Rinaldo Ernesti had scarcely passed his fortieth year, yet his hair was white as a snowdrift, and his brow bore marks which sixty years would scarcely have stamped there, if those years had been spent in the calm enjoyment of the blessings to which he was born. His high station and noble fortune had only proved fairy gifts to him, for the ill use of which a grievous price had been exacted. Ernesti had been a singularly handsome man, and his marked features bore the stamp of patrician blood in the clearly cut curves of the thin nostril, the short upper lip, and the finely moulded chin, but the expression was stern, haughty and relentless, and even in his present attitude of humiliation, his carriage was more that of a Roman senator in the days of Rome's palmy pride, than that of a penitent who implores pardon for his sins.</p> 
               <p>An hour was passed in prayer, and then he arose, gave a last mournful look to the face of her he had once madly loved and fearfully punished, and left the room, closing the door softly and carefully behind him.</p> 
               <p>A recess in front of one of the library windows was<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6335-00000073"/> shaded by the waving branches of umbrageous trees, and in this was placed a small antique stand, on which stood a carafe of ice-water, a cut glass goblet, and a sevres china plate filled with dates. This was the only refection the count allowed himself upon that sad anniversary of the life-wreck which had overtaken him.</p> 
               <p>He threw himself upon the chair in front of the table, and with clasped hands, gloomy brow, and writhing lips, recalled the anguish, crime and despair of all those years, flowing from one cause, jealousy, fed, fired, and confirmed by one he had believed his friend, yet who had strangely urged him on to the commission of a crime which could scarcely be paralleled in the annals of civilization.</p> 
               <p>A crime that made him thrill and shiver with a nameless dread when its recollection swept across his conscience in those hours of solitude of which he passed so many. No wonder was it that his hair was white, that his features bore the stamp of premature age; the wonder was that reason had not long since reeled beneath the ghastly burden of his fatal secret.</p> 
               <p>Ernesti, with his wasted hands clasped over his face, seemed absorbed in gloomy thought; half an hour passed thus, when a faint, timid rap was struck upon the door. He started violently, looked angry and astonished, and when the knock was repeated, asked in a harsh tone:</p> 
               <p>"Who dares to disturb me on this day?"</p> 
               <p>A deprecating voice from behind the closed door replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is I, Jacopo, my lord, and I bring to you a letter of such importance as demands immediate attention."</p> 
               <p>"Let the letter wait till to-morrow," was the stern response. "It is well known to all my household that on this day I attend to no secular affairs. Take it away at once."</p> 
               <p>This was uttered in his most imperious tone, but the man again ventured to speak:</p> 
                
               <p>"My lord, the bearer waits. He insists on seeing you without delay, and-and-oh, my lord, believe your faithful Jacopo, <emph>it will be best to see him,</emph> but before doing so, it will be necessary to read the few lines I bring you."</p> 
               <p>There was so marked an emphasis on a portion of his words, and the voice of the speaker sounded so tremulous, that his agitation communicated itself to the listener. His cadaverous face grew yet more livid, and he staggered from his seat as if moved by a sudden impulse of fear.</p> 
               <p>Hurriedly opening the door, his steward, an elderly man of respectable appearance, stood before him, holding a package, which bore upon it the seal of the Pope. It was marked:</p> 
               <p>"Important-to be delivered to Count Ernesti without delay."</p> 
               <p>The authority of the head of the church is still held in great respect in Italy, and Ernesti thought he understood the source of the steward's extreme anxiety to fulfill the mission intrusted to him. But if he had glanced at the man's face, he would have seen that his emotion had a deeper source than respect for the church; its usual purple hue had changed to a leaden pallor, and his eyes had in them a wild expression of terror that might have startled the most casual observer. But Count Ernesti only snatched the letter, and without a glance at the bearer, briefly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have broken my vow thus far, but the messenger must await my pleasure; I cannot see him to-day."</p> 
               <p>The steward did not venture to reply. He bent his head respectfully, and the door was closed upon him. But the man did not go away; he staggered against the wall, waiting and listening with breathless impatience to be recalled, for he knew that the bearer of that missive must be received, even upon the day dedicated to penitence and prayer.</p> 
               <p>The door was no sooner secured within than Ernesti tore<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6335-00000074"/> open the envelope, and gazed with stupid terror upon its contents. There was a single folded paper, on which a faint pencil sketch was traced, representing a vault, a bound man, a pile of stones, and a tub of mortar, but they were awfully suggestive to him whose eyes now glared upon them, as if the dread phantom of his life had suddenly assumed form and substance.</p> 
               <p>Beneath was written:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"The avenger is upon your track. Will you receive him alone, or will you force him to blazon your crime to the world? Decide quickly, for on this anniversary I choose to perform my mission. I must see you without delay, for I have that to communicate which no third person should hear. If you refuse to hearken to it in the privacy of your library, it shall be proclaimed aloud before your menials. Choose for yourself."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>There was no signature, but the Count recognized the writing, and he also remembered the implacable nature of the man who had traced those lines. With a deep groan he struck his hand upon his brow, and bitterly said:</p> 
               <p>"Better had I died myself than have listened to the voice of him who pretended to be my friend, while he urged me on to that terrible sacrifice. I hoped the wretch was dead, but he comes after years of silence to torture me again; and see-he has dared to use a false seal representing the authority of the head of the holy church. Sacrilegious wretch! this merits severe punishment, if I durst mete it out to him; but I dare not, for I am fatally in his power, and he knows it."</p> 
               <p>He hastily swallowed a goblet of the ice-cold water, and then with shaking hand rang the silver bell that rested on the table. It had scarcely vibrated when he heard the sound of the lock turning; but he had fastened it on the inner side, and with unsteady steps Ernesti approached it, and again stood before his steward with a face so changed that even Jacopo was appalled. Making an effort to steady his voice, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Let the bearer of this letter come to me. It is more important than I thought, and the Pope will give me absolution for attending to his commands even on the day I have dedicated to penance."</p> 
               <p>"Undoubtedly, my lord," replied Jacopo, with a strange expression on his frightened face, and he hurried away upon his errand.</p> 
               <p>Ernesti walked to and fro with perturbed steps and frowning brow, and when the measured tread of him who was approaching fell upon his ear, he waited in breathless expectation till he stood upon the threshold.</p> 
               <p>The steward stepped aside, and a tall figure in the dress of a priest, with his shovel hat pulled over his brows, stood with folded arms in the doorway calmly surveying the agitated man he had come to visit.</p> 
               <p>Making a violent effort for self-control, Ernesti advanced a step, and hoarsely said:</p> 
               <p>"Enter and let us confer together as briefly as may be, and then-"</p> 
               <p>"And then?" interrupted the deep-toned voice of the stranger. "What then, Rinaldo Ernesti? Wait till you have heard me, for I bring tidings of great importance to you. The good Jacopo will leave us alone, for his complicity in your other affairs does not entitle him to hear the communication of which I am the bearer."</p> 
               <p>Ernesti waved his hand to the steward, and he immediately stepped back and closed the door behind the visitor, though he did not remove himself far from the spot; on the contrary, he used his utmost ingenuity to overhear what<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6335-00000075"/> was passing within the room. In this, however, he was baffled; for the Count led the way to the farther end of the long apartment, and pointed to a seat near the table.</p> 
               <p>The visitor sank into it, helped himself to a goblet of water, and with a laugh, said:</p> 
               <p>"Lenten fare this, and poor welcome to a long absent <emph>friend,</emph> ha! ha!"</p> 
               <p>There was something so sinister in the sound of his laugh that the listener shuddered. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Can you jest while you crush me! Friend! I once madly believed you such, Barnardo, but in the years that have gone by since that fatal night I have gained a more accurate perception of your true character. I have even, at times, doubted if all you revealed to me was true; I have feared that you had some purpose of your own to gain in urging me on to the commission of a deed that has filled my days with remorse, and my nights with dreams of horror."</p> 
               <p>The Count paused with the cold dew of suffering bursting out upon his brow. With a sardonic smile, Barnardo laid aside his hat, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"So-in spite of my disguise, you know me?"</p> 
               <p>Ernesti pointed impressively to the pencil sketch.</p> 
               <p>"Who but you could have sent me that reminder? You announced yourself as legibly as if your name had been written upon the paper."</p> 
               <p>"A priest, through the confessional, might have gained the same power, and I thought it possible that I might play a part for a season; but it does not matter. Since you know me, you also know that I have come on business of serious import, for I never trifle."</p> 
               <p>"Speak-I listen. What has brought you to me after the lapse of so many years?"</p> 
               <p>"A discovery of vital consequence to you."</p> 
               <p>"Of what nature?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Have you not of late revived the search for the retreat of the wife who fled from your roof on the night of-of <emph>the sacrifice?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The Count shivered, and a livid pallor overspread his convulsed features, but he retained sufficient command of his voice to say:</p> 
               <p>"You are right. I wish to reclaim my daughter; the girl has become important to me, and I must receive her as my child."</p> 
               <p>"Why so? I must be enlightened as to the causes of your anxiety to reclaim the daughter you have so long permitted to remain in obscurity."</p> 
               <p>"She is the heiress of my name and fortune, and she is now of a marriageable age. Are not these sufficient reasons for wishing to discover the hiding-place of herself and her mother?" replied the Count, evasively.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo fixed his searching glance upon him.</p> 
               <p>"They seem to be, but there is yet another motive. Speak; unveil the whole truth, for I must know it. Count Ernesti, you are no mystery to me; like the ostrich that hides its head in the sand, and believes itself invisible to its pursuer, you make shallow efforts to deceive me, but I warn you that I see through and baffle them. Why was Luigni Roma sent on this errand to Isola Rossa, with such pressing instructions to follow up the clue which you believed you had at last found?"</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you know that? Where, then, is Luigni? and why have I heard nothing from him for more than two months?"</p> 
               <p>"Because he has gone to his account, and his credentials have fallen into my hands. Here they are," and Barnardo produced the papers he had purloined from the house of Matra.</p> 
               <p>"From these I learned that Count Ernesti wishes to<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6335-00000076"/> reclaim the daughter he has so long virtually cast off. Now, knowing you as well as I do, I am certain that some interest, is to be served by claiming this child. What is it?"</p> 
               <p>At this abrupt demand the Count changed color, and his eyes sank before those of the brigand, which were bent unflinchingly upon him. He made no immediate reply, and Barnardo went on:</p> 
               <p>"The title you bear cannot descend to your daughter; you may have saved a dower for her from your income, but of that I am doubtful; for your offerings to the church, as an atonement for your crime, have drained your coffers. If the girl comes back to you, is it your purpose to immolate her as a sin offering also? Have you thought of making her a nun?"</p> 
               <p>"No-I have no such intention. You speak the truth with reference to my affairs, though how you have kept yourself so accurately informed of them I cannot imagine. Since you insist upon it, I will tell you the truth. A brother of my wife went to the island of Barbadoes, and settled. He there accumulated an immense fortune, which he has bequeathed to my daughter on the sole condition that she is acknowledged by me, and restored to her true position as Countess Ernesti. She will be a millionaire, and I have no right to defraud her of her inheritance. I have bitterly repented of my precipitation, and I fear that I treated my wife with unjustifiable barbarity. Look at me-see how I have suffered, and pity me. If you know aught of this child, give me the power to atone for the past. It is the only expiation I can now make."</p> 
               <p>While he thus spoke, Barnardo surveyed him with an inexplicable expression, in which aversion and contempt were blended with other and deeper feelings. His voice rang out clear as a clarion-deep as a death-bell:</p> 
               <p>"So-o, Count Ernesti, suffering has taught you a lesson, and you at last feel that you may have been unjust to the wife you crushed as never was woman crushed before. Now listen to <emph>me,</emph> and believe that a spirit from the Inferno has been sent hither to tempt you, to torture you; finally, perhaps, to destroy you. I have no mercy in my heart, Count Ernesti, for I am a Corsican, and the vendetta was sworn by me against you in those years when we stood together, in the morning of life, seeming friends, but on my part, in reality we were deadly foes."</p> 
               <p>The count raised his hand to his head, and tried to carry his memory back to the days of their youth; but his thoughts grew bewildered, and he feebly said:</p> 
               <p>"I felt no enmity toward you; on the contrary, I trusted you, I followed your counsels, and see to what they have brought me."</p> 
               <p>A smile of bitter meaning played over the features of Barnardo, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"It has brought you exactly to what I intended it should. Listen, count, noble, senator, to the story I have to relate, and then dare to judge me as one prosecuting an unjust vengeance."</p>

               <p>BARNARDO paused an instant, and then, with relentless voice, went on:</p> 
               <p>"My father was a man of brilliant talents and impulsive temperament; the last gave his deadly foe an advantage over him which threw him into a dungeon, where he perished of that hopelessness which wears into the soul of the<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6335-00000077"/> prisoner. Ten years of his life were wasted in that dreary abode, and during every hour of those years he invoked retribution upon the head of him who caused him to suffer thus. The author of those sufferings was <emph>your</emph> father."</p> 
               <p>The count made an effort to speak, but Barnardo waved his hand, and rapidly proceeded:</p> 
               <p>"Hear me out, for I cannot be interrupted. With the subtle precaution of his Italian nature, Ernesti concealed his own agency in these persecutions, and thought to disarm future vengeance by pretended kindness to the son of his victim. I was received into his palace, educated with his heir, and treated as an equal-for I, too, was of noble blood.</p> 
               <p>"The story of my father's wrongs was sedulously concealed from me, and I grew to manhood in the belief that Count Ernesti was the best friend that an orphan boy ever possessed. I was nineteen years of age, when a package from the secret archives of the Inquisition was delivered to me. The priest who attended my father in his last moments, pledged himself to communicate to me the facts of his arrest, his long imprisonment, and final death in the cell in which he had passed so many years of agony. A copy of all the proceedings against him was among the papers, and from them I learned that the man whose bread I ate-to whom I was indebted for a home, education, everything that made me what I was-had basely destroyed my father to the slow tortures of despair, because he was a political rival that he feared and hated.</p> 
               <p>"To thrust him from his own path, he had given him ten years of living anguish, and to complete the wrong, he had won the gratitude and affection of that victim's child. Yes-hard and reckless as I now am, I loved your father once. How unworthy he was of that love, you now know; how strong the feeling was, is proved by the fact that it withheld held my hand when it was raised to strike the venerable head I had so long revered.</p> 
               <p>"When this revelation came to me, Count Ernesti lay upon his death-bed, and I spared him the few days God yet granted him on earth; but I savagely repeated the assurance that 'the sins of the father shall be visited upon his children,' and bided my time."</p> 
               <p>The listener shuddered, and his chilled heart grew yet heavier as he regarded the speaker. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Yet for years after that time you played the part of my friend."</p> 
               <p>There was a touch of feeling in Barnardo's voice, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"True-and until after events stamped their impress upon my life, I shrank from the retribution I believed it my solemn duty to exact."</p> 
               <p>"And those events-"</p> 
               <p>"Have patience; I am coming to them. The record is not very long, but it is very, very terrible."</p> 
               <p>The count again drank from the iced water, and Barnardo watched him with a kind of diabolical triumph in his dark, burning eyes. He arose, and pointed through the open window toward a village lying on the edge of the bay, which was indistinctly seen through the foliage of the trees.</p> 
               <p>"In yonder hamlet dwelt a lovely girl belonging to the better class of the peasantry. Ginevra Vivaldi was the toast of the whole country; but I need not tell <emph>you</emph> how fair she was. We both saw her, we both loved her."</p> 
               <p>The count would have spoken, but his voice died away in an indistinct murmur, and Barnardo went on as if no interruption had been attempted.</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra was already betrothed to one of her own caste, a handsome youth, who expected to lead her to the altar on the next festival day. The bridal presents were made, the<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6335-00000078"/> trousseau was prepared, when I entered her bower of bliss, and whispered that beauty such as hers should never be concealed in a peasant's cottage.</p> 
               <p>"The girl was ambitious; she listened to my flatteries, and slighted her lover, though I saw through all, that her heart really preferred him. When I thought of Ginevra, the madness of a first passion fired my heart, and rendered my brain dizzy. She bewildered me, fascinated me, and made me wild to tear her from her promised husband, even while I knew that in secret her heart clung to him.</p> 
               <p>"You know the sequel, Ernesti; yet I will retrace it for you. You heard me rave of Ginevra's charms-you sought her out, became equally enamored of, her, and offered as a bribe the station of a countess. Her weak heart yielded to the temptation; she cast aside both her former lovers, and pledged herself to you.</p> 
               <p>"In my deep soul I felt that she was too worthless to contend for; but the sting of mortified pride, and wounded affection, gave the needed impulse to the purpose of my vengeance which had so long slumbered. From the hour in which you stepped between me and the woman I wildly loved, there was deadly vendetta between us. But I was too wary to betray the fury that filled my heart; you were powerful, I was weak; and I knew that only by secret machinations could I succeed in gaining that vengeance which, from that hour, I was resolute to make the cherished purpose of my life."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo paused here, but the count only motioned to him; the words he attempted to utter died away upon his lips, and he listened in appalled silence to this long-delayed revelation.</p> 
               <p>"You succeeded in winning Ginevra from her betrothed, yet you deferred for months the marriage which was to repay her for the sacrifice of her affections. I found it easy to arouse the suspicious jealousy of her brothers, and make them believe that you were trifling with her. I trusted that it might indeed prove so, for then I could renew my pretension to her favor, but your love proved stronger than your pride, and sooner than relinquish her, you gave her your name, and elevated the peasant girl to your own rank.</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra Vivaldi became Countess Ernesti, and her elder brother, with a sum of money advanced by you, emigrated to the West Indies, where, it seems, he eventually grew rich. You employed masters for your new toy; you sought to cultivate her natural graces, that, in time, she might adorn the station to which you had raised her, but you could not give her happiness.</p> 
               <p>"The silly child had imagined that a stately home, with servants at her command, would supply all the needs of her nature, but she too soon discovered that to her passionate soul this brilliant home was but a desert of tinsel and marble, amid which she walked in dreariness of heart, and she prayed for forgiveness for having deserted the man she loved, to gain them.</p> 
               <p>"I had watched Ginevra from a distance from the time of her marriage, but at this crisis I again appeared upon the scene. I would have lured her from her allegiance to her wedded lord, but she indignantly refused to listen to my avowals of love, and threatened to reveal to you that I had dared to make them. That threat sealed her fate. I became more guarded in my conduct toward her, but I hoarded the anger that burned fiercely within me, till it would be safe to display it."</p> 
               <p>The count muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God! to what does all this tend? What, what is coming to annihilate me at one fell blow?"</p> 
               <p>"Listen, and you shall hear," replied Barnardo, with sardonic coolness. "I kept my eye on Guiseppe, the<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6335-00000079"/> discarded lover of Ginevra. I knew that in his despair at the perfidy of his betrothed, he had gone into the forest, and become the companion of outlaws and desperate men. I also knew that he had twice penetrated to the grounds which surrounded this castle, and each time had found means to see and speak with the object of his undying affection.</p> 
               <p>"I kept this knowledge to myself, with the resolution to use it at the proper moment for the furtherance of my own purposes. This man had become a sanguinary bandit; his life was forfeited to the laws, for he had twice committed murder with his own hand since he fled to the forest. I regarded his sacrifice as of small moment, if by that means I gained over you the power I yearned to possess.</p> 
               <p>"I would make you the agent of vengeance upon Guiseppe, and when the heart of your wife was turned from you in loathing and horror, I would again breathe into her ear the tale of my devotion, and show her that her only refuge from the authority of him who had so outraged her nature, was the protection I offered her."</p> 
               <p>"Fiend! wretch! how dare you thus coolly trace out the diabolical plan which had such an ending!" exclaimed Count Ernesti, with feverish impatience. "This is torture more consummate than any inflicted by tyrants."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo calmly replied:</p> 
               <p>"So <emph>you</emph> may think, but the man who suffered ten years of solitary confinement, shut out from all sympathy with his kind, might not agree with you if he were here to speak for himself. But I must proceed with my narrative, which I perceive has a powerful interest for you, my lord, though its chief incidents are already so well known to you."</p> 
               <p>Ernesti only made a faint gesture in reply; all the sternness, the haughtiness of his real nature, seemed crushed out by the dominant presence of this man. Barnardo went on:</p> 
               <p>"The birth of her daughter seemed to give a new impulse to the life of the countess. You were disappointed that an heir to your name was not given, but she was perfectly contented with the little morsel of humanity which seemed to win her back to happiness. I began to fear that she would reconcile herself to the lot she had chosen, and in time, even learn to return the affection you lavished upon her.</p> 
               <p>"Until then I had not thoroughly hated you, but that thought made me a madman. I sent you anonymous accusations against your wife. I poisoned your mind till you were frantic with jealousy; I proved to you that your idol had met her former lover, on more occasions than one, in the grape walk, which ended in a summer-house overlooking the sea. I learned that the young mother had made an appointment to meet him there for the last time, to show him her infant treasure, and entreat him, by the tender helplessness of this new tie that bound her to her wedded lord, to leave her in peace to reconcile herself to the splendid monotony in which she lived.</p> 
               <p>"I warned you of the meeting. You took the vindictive measures counseled by me; you and your tool, Jacopo, concealed yourselves near the scene of the meeting; you sprang upon Guiseppe, disarmed and bound him. You then bore him to the chapel, while I conveyed the fainting Ginevra to her own apartment. When she regained her senses, she clung to me with such passionate entreaty that I could not deny her prayer. I led her to the chapel to behold the awful scene enacting there."</p> 
               <p>The count arose, threw his arms above his head, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Enough! enough! I cannot bear more. Do not recall the horrors of that night, or I shall go mad."</p> 
               <p>"But to do so is necessary to the completion of my story," replied Barnardo, with composure. "You must hear it, for<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6335-00000080"/> it is a portion of your allotted penance, and it is not for <emph>me</emph> to spare you a single pang, for in this interview, the hoarded bitterness of years has found its outlet."</p> 
               <p>The count bowed his head in his hands, and the brigand resumed:</p> 
               <p>"Guiseppe, gagged and bound, lay helpless upon the floor, and a niche in the wall, which had been laid open, revealed the awful fate awarded him. Jacopo, at that time a stone-mason in your employment, stood by him with trowel in hand, ready to fulfill your commands, for he had the promise of the stewardship he has since held if he served you faithfully, and kept your secret well.</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra, with eyes dilated by terror, and a soul rent with anguish, rushed to your feet, and implored the life of her lover. You-cold, hard as the marble pillar against which you leaned-bade her look upon the punishment of the serf who had dared to come between a noble and his bride; who had breathed his unhallowed passion into the ears of a wedded wife. <emph>He must die!</emph> that was the only atonement he could now offer.</p> 
               <p>"At these stern words the pale woman arose, and threw herself between you and your victim. With her frail arms she sought to protect him, but with savage violence you tore her from his side; you held her with a grasp of iron, and forced her to look on while Jacopo lifted the bound form as easily as if it had been one of the senseless blocks of stone he was in the habit of handling daily. Holding him with one hand in an upright position, he fastened a leather belt which was worn about the waist of his prisoner to sustain his pistols, to a strong iron hook that had been placed in the centre of the niche in which he was to be immured alive.</p> 
               <p>"I looked on with the certainty that Guiseppe was a criminal who merited his fate, and I felt that, after all, his agony would be brief, while the living death of <emph>my</emph> father had extended over ten years of anguish. If you could thus outrage your wife with the insane idea that you were wiping from your brow the stain of this plebeian love, it was no concern of mine. Let the bandit perish, and I would reap the reward of your crime. To me Ginevra must now turn as her only friend, and she should not turn in vain."</p> 
               <p>"It was with you she then fled?" said Ernesti, in a tone of intense bitterness. "Is that what you have come to reveal to me?"</p> 
               <p>"No; for until within a few weeks past I was as ignorant as you of her place of concealment."</p> 
               <p>"Go on, then. Since I can only get the sequel of the story by listening to all these horrible details, I must even nerve myself to bear them."</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra, half dead with terror, cowered at your feet, with her wild eyes gleaming from amid her dishevelled tresses, gazing in dumb despair upon the helpless form of her lover, which was covered with blood from a severe flesh wound he had received in the struggle for his capture. In the presence of the awful fate that menaced him, Guiseppe seemed paralyzed by fear and loss of blood. He made feeble efforts to escape from the bonds that secured him, but they were too tightly drawn to permit a chance of success, and after a few convulsive struggles his limbs ceased to move, the pallor of death settled over his features, and his head drooped forward as if fainting.</p> 
               <p>"Impassive and relentless, you motioned to Jacopo to commence his allotted task. From the feet upward the wall was slowly reared, and carefully cemented, and with each successive layer a pair of pale, clasped hands were lifted in supplication toward you, a faint, dying voice pleaded for mercy-mercy for him, for her. But you sternly repeated:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>'He must die!'</emph>
               </p> 
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6335-00000081"/> 
               <p>"Gradually the aperture narrowed; the chest of the living man was enclosed, the head alone remained uncovered. He seemed scarcely to breathe, but his eyes unclosed and fixed themselves upon her for whose punishment this terrible doom had been awarded him. Ginevra sprang toward him, threw her arms around his neck, and shrieked:</p> 
               <p>"'Let me die with him! for him have I alone loved! Count Ernesti, destroy us both, and live yourself to remorse and retribution. I bequeath them to you.'</p> 
               <p>"She passionately kissed the pale brow of the imprisoned man, assured him of her undying devotion, and uttered against his murderer such frantic maledictions as women in extremity of anguish can alone express."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes-I recall it all," whispered the Count, in husky tones. "She was right; remorse and retribution have been my lot from that hour to this, and your words only assure me that my punishment has but commenced."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you begin to comprehend that? It is well-let me proceed:</p> 
               <p>"Guiseppe, bound and gagged, could give no other sign of emotion except through his large black eyes, but they were opened to their full extent, and their expression will haunt me to my dying day. Love, anguish, despair shone through them, flashing into an expression of defiance as you approached him, and tore the arms of your wife, ha! ha! <emph>your wife,</emph> from the head she would have sheltered and saved at the sacrifice of her own life.</p> 
               <p>"The stone that shut out his features was lifted to its place, and Ginevra sank lifeless at your feet. I sprinkled over her water from the holy fount, and when she again unclosed her eyes, I raised her to her feet, and would have conducted her from that fearful spot, but you, inflexible in your cruelty, turned her face toward the wall which now presented a solid mass of stone, and said:</p> 
                
               <p>"'It is finished, madam. Behold how Ernesti punishes the wretch who dared to come between himself and the love he claims as his just right.'</p> 
               <p>"Ginevra faintly replied:</p> 
               <p>"'In time that love might have been yours, for I wished to be faithful to the vows I have plighted to you; but now, Count Rinaldo, a wall of fire is built up between us which no tears may quench, no repentance wash away. Farewell forever.'</p> 
               <p>"She would not permit you to touch her, and I assisted her to her room; I then retired to my own apartment, oppressed with a weight of horror at the dreadful scene of which I had been a passive spectator. Yet mingled with this was the exulting certainty that Ginevra was forever separated from the man who had so cruelly outraged her. In her desolation I was the only protector to whom she could appeal for aid to fly from the presence of the husband I knew she must henceforth loathe.</p> 
               <p>"Toward morning I at length fell into a perturbed slumber, which must have lasted several hours, for the sun was shining broadly into my room, when I was aroused by a commotion in the castle. I started up, dressed myself hurriedly, and went forth to inquire its cause. A frightened servant informed me that both the countess and her child were missing.</p> 
               <p>"I rushed to Ginevra's room to assure myself that his words were true. Her bed had not been slept in; the cradle of her infant was empty, and on examining her drawers, it was found that the fugitive had taken with her a considerable sum of money, and a few valuable jewels.</p> 
               <p>"Like a madman you sought for her everywhere in the home so lately hers, and also in the village. When convinced that she was concealed nowhere near you, large rewards were offered for any information concerning her.<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6335-00000082"/> But all your efforts were baffled-strange as it seems, the slightest clue to her retreat was never gained. A woman in the garb of a peasant, carrying an infant in her arms, had been seen at daylight in the village below, but whence she came, or whither she had gone, was a mystery that was never solved till the death of Tomaso Vivaldi threw his papers into your hands.</p> 
               <p>"From a letter among them, you learned that your long-lost wife had taken refuge in Corsica.</p> 
               <p>"From her death-bed she wrote a letter to her brother, revealing the fact that she had given her child to the peasant woman in whose house she spent the last months of her life; and she conjured him to leave that child to be reared by those to whom she had confided her. She assured Tomaso that, after all she had suffered at the hands of her husband, she could never believe that her daughter, although the heiress of his name and honors, would be welcome in the house of her father.</p> 
               <p>"Tomaso was absorbed in money-making, and he took no measures to restore the girl to her birthright; but it seems that when he came to die, he bequeathed his earnings to his sister's child, on the condition that she shall be acknowledged as your daughter. This news broke the apathy in which you had long lived, and you dispatched an agent to Isola Rossa to endeavor to trace her. Am I not right in these last statements?"</p> 
               <p>The count bent his head in assent:</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly right; but it remains to be explained how those papers fell into your hands, and to inform me what has become of my messenger."</p> 
               <p>"He is dead, as I before intimated. It matters not how he died; suffice it, that he met his fate while endeavoring to execute your commands. The casket containing his instructions fell into the hands of a trader of Isola Rossa, who was on the eve of seeking a wife. From this waif Matra learned the rank and probable fortune of the supposed peasant girl. He knew facts concerning a beautiful creature in the town which tallied with the revelations contained in the papers; moreover, he had accidentally seen the blood-mark which is the heirloom of the Ernesti from the days of the Crusades, when Rinaldo of the bloody hand thrust his dagger through the heart of the pacha's wife, and wounded her to death."</p> 
               <p>"And what then?" asked the count, haughtily and impatiently. "I trust the girl is free; that no plebeian alliance shackles her to the base set of churls it has been the sad fortune of <emph>my</emph> child to be reared among."</p> 
               <p>"Patience-patience, my lord Count, and you shall hear. This Matra formed a scheme to marry her himself. He was passing rich, and the foster mother listened complacently to his proposal. Clarice, for such is the name given to your daughter, rebelled against her decision, and refused to receive the trader as her future husband. But her objections were scarcely listened to, and--"</p> 
               <p>The Count here burst in, his cold eyes gleaming with suddenly aroused passion:</p> 
               <p>"And she-she is the wife of a plebeian trader! she-the daughter of my ancient line, the heiress of such a fortune! Gods! this is too much! I will snatch her from him, and thrust him down to the obscurity to which he belongs!"</p> 
               <p>"Calm yourself, Count, and receive my assurance that, thanks to my interference, Clarice did not become his wife. On the eve of the marriage, I discovered the secret of Matra's anxiety to secure her hand, and at the same time a clue to her family was gained. I have led a wild life, as you know, Ernesti, and I have had many strange friends. This Matra was one of them; he had grown rich by selling smuggled goods with which I furnished him, and thus he<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6335-00000083"/> was in my power. Yet at the last, I only saved your daughter from this infamous alliance by taking the life of the bridegroom on the day of the marriage."</p> 
               <p>"I owe you thanks for that; though how or why you came to perform so hazardous an act of friendship for child of mine, I do not yet understand."</p> 
               <p>"I risked nothing for <emph>your</emph> daughter, believe me," replied Barnardo, with bitter emphasis. "It was for the sake of the mother, whose retreat I had sought for years, with the mad hope that, lost, ruined as I was, she might yet return my love. Wait, Count Ernesti, till you know all, and then you will be better able to judge if you owe me <emph>thanks</emph> for the part I have taken in the affairs of your heiress."</p> 
               <p>"Go on-go on. I am trembling with impatience. What new turn of evil have you been able to do me? for that it is evil I read in the exultation upon your brow and lip. Yet methinks time might have exhausted your hoarded venom long ago."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo scarcely heeded the import of Ernesti's words, for now he was about to strike his most deadly blow upon the towering pride of his foe. He impressively proceeded:</p> 
               <p>"Clarice had another suitor; he was young, handsome, and devoted to her; therefore she loved him, even as Ginevra once loved the plighted bridegroom of her youth. I favored their union; I arranged the means of escape for them, and Guilio Falcone tore his bride from Matra almost at the altar, and bore her away to the mountain solitude in which he lives."</p> 
               <p>The listener became even paler than before, and he gasped:</p> 
               <p>"Mountain solitude! you have not then permitted the daughter of my house to wed with a bandit? an outlaw, as your words seems to portend; for I know enough of Corsican life to be aware that only that class of men dwell among the hills."</p> 
                
               <p>"You are very astute, Count, to have guessed the truth so quickly. Falcone is the son of the celebrated Theodore, with whose exploits, twenty years ago, the whole island rang. The vendetta is his birthright, but Guilio is a gallant fellow, and has inherited his father's noblest traits."</p> 
               <p>"Which are his only inheritance, I presume, except the infamy of his descent," said the count, with an accent of supreme scorn. "Truly, you have consummated your long-cherished scheme of vengeance by giving my child to such a fate as this. But I will rescue her from it; I will tear her from this low-born husband, and place her in her true position, as the heiress of my ancient name, and the possessor of a brilliant fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose she should refuse both rank and wealth, as the price of her separation from the chosen of her heart?" asked Barnardo, tauntingly.</p> 
               <p>"Then I will take her from him by force; compel her to wear the trappings of her station, and having worn them a few brief months, she will be no true daughter of Eve if she is willing to relinquish them for the life of poverty and privation she must lead as the outlaw's bride."</p> 
               <p>"But I assure you that such will not be her fate. Falcone inherited a sufficient sum to enable him to embark in a most lucrative employment, and he has acquired sufficient wealth to enable him to surround his wife with a degree of luxury to which she was never accustomed in her cottage home. He inhabits a cave among the hills, the entrance to which has hitherto baffled the keenest sbirri; and if Clarice can endure the solitude of her mountain home, she will find there all that is needed for her happiness."</p> 
               <p>The count passionately said:</p> 
               <p>"And how did the father acquire the means of which you spoke? Did he not levy black-mail upon the people of the valley, as any other robber does? It is true, that he lavishly<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6335-00000084"/> gave what was so easily gained; but his liberality cannot conceal the infamy of its acquisition. Oh! degradation! to think that child of mine should share such ignoble spoil!"</p> 
               <p>"Bethink thee, Count Ernesti; are your own skirts so clear that you can afford to scorn such a man as Theodore Falcone was? Condemned to the life of an outlaw for no crime of his own, in a state of society unparalleled in any other country in the world, he was celebrated for his gallant daring, and his open-handed generosity. The inheritance of his son was the produce of voluntary contributions, paid after his death by the people of the valleys, over which he had reigned as a king.</p> 
               <p>"This sum was well managed by Count Rospoli, a nobleman, who took the boy under his protection, and would have educated him for the priesthood; but Guilio rebelled against this fate, and fled to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchia.</foreign> But the count was faithful to his voluntary stewardship, and a sufficient sum was paid over by him to enable his former protg to embark in such speculations as have made him rich enough to live in elegance in the mountain home he has chosen. Clarice is happy with the husband she loves. Let her remain in peace, and I bury the vendetta. 'Tis the only atonement I can now make to her unhappy mother for the suffering my selfish passion inflicted upon her."</p> 
               <p>The count regarded him sternly and coldly:</p> 
               <p>"You speak thus because you know me too well to suppose for an instant that I will yield assent to your proposal. Bear the burden of your own sin, without seeking to make such atonement as this; and I also will bear mine. It can become no heavier than it already is, and no inducement can be held out to me to give up my only child to such a fate as she has embraced. Clarice must be separated from the man who claims her as his wife, in as brief a time as possible. Was it your purpose in coming hither to show me the means of doing this? or was it only to hurl this wretchedness upon me, and then leave me blindly to seek the clue to her present retreat?"</p> 
               <p>"I had no purpose beyond that which has been made sufficiently apparent. Count Ernesti, you took to your home the only woman I have ever loved, to trample on and crush her. Your high station was a lure to her weak heart, but I truly believe it will be none to her child. Yet I know not; were she mine, I would leave her to the lot she has chosen, for I believe she will find happiness in it, if the sleeping demons of vanity and pride are left untempted. Yet, if it is your will to drag Clarice from her husband's protection, I will not say you nay. I can gain for you such access to the ear of your daughter as will ensure her knowledge of all you can offer in exchange for the sacrifice of true love and simple faith."</p> 
               <p>"But that involves delay, and I must at once tear her from this infamous alliance, and bring her hither, where the low-born serf who claims her dare not come," said the count, imperiously. "Not a day, not an hour shall she remain with him, after my emissaries have reached her."</p> 
               <p>"Wait till they do reach her, Count," replied Barnardo, significantly. "You seem to forget how inaccessible are the mountain fastnesses of Corsica, and if your daughter chooses to do so, she can baffle you for years, perhaps altogether, for she is keen of wit, and passionately devoted to Guilio. Receive him as her husband, and she will come to you without hesitation."</p> 
               <p>"What! accept the bandit as my son!" exclaimed the haughty noble, with undisguised contempt. "It is much that I am willing to take back the daughter he has degraded by his infamous love, without also receiving him in my home as an equal. No; the girl must be reclaimed, because the fortune of Vivaldi is too large to be forfeited, and only as<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6335-00000085"/> Countess Ernesti can Clarice claim it as her own. But for that, I should scarcely seek to regain a child who has been unknown to me from her infancy. Doubtless Clarice has in her manners and appearance much that will be repulsive to me, reared as she has been among low-bred people."</p> 
               <p>"In that you are mistaken. Clarice has inherited the grace and beauty of her mother, and the haughtiest of your race could not be more aristocratic in bearing than this little waif of Isola Rossa."</p> 
               <p>The count listened eagerly; he slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"She has also the stamp of the Ernesti-the mark of the bloody dagger. It is a strange freak of nature, that after the lapse of ages this family heritage should reappear at stated intervals. Three strokes of the dagger were given to a defenceless woman, and on every third generation does the birth-mark stamp its bloody impress upon the old crusader's descendants. Do you know the history of those who have borne it?"</p> 
               <p>His voice sunk almost to a whisper as he asked this question.</p> 
               <p>"It has been tragic, I believe," replied Barnardo.</p> 
               <p>The count shuddered.</p> 
               <p>"It is a curse which has not yet been expiated. Four of my male ancestors have borne the fatal mark, and they all perished by violence. But one woman before my daughter inherited it; she fled from her father's roof with her lover, was pursued by her brother, and with her own hand fired the pistol that destroyed him. She thus saved the life of him who was destined, in time, to become her own murderer, for in a paroxysm of mad jealousy, her husband stabbed her to the heart a few years after her flight from her paternal home, and thus fearfully was expiated her fratricidal act. So you see that Clarice bears the doom of her race upon her."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then leave fate to work out its own purposes," said Barnardo. "Severed from you, perhaps she may escape the evil; drag her hither against her will, that she may claim wealth she does not need, and the end may be fatal. I came to you, Count Ernesti, to triumph over your fallen pride; but an impulse I cannot resist impels me to plead in behalf of the tender and true heart I so lately saw pledged to follow the fortunes of her mountain king. Leave your child to obey the noble instincts of her nature, and she will lead an innocent and happy life. Bring her hither, surround her with the allurements of wealth; corrupt her heart with ambitious hopes and worldly schemes, and the doom of your race may follow her, because she will then become unfit to escape it."</p> 
               <p>The proud lip of the listener curled.</p> 
               <p>"Truly an innocent and respectable life she will lead as the wife of the banned outlaw, who will doubtless take up the trade of his father, and live on the forced contributions of those who fear to refuse his demands. Such a life does not comport with my ideas of respectability, and my child shall be rescued from it at all hazards. My neglect of her has hitherto been involuntary; for I would long since have claimed her if I had known where she was hidden; now I shall lose no time in taking such measures as are necessary to restore her to her true rank in life."</p> 
               <p>"So be it, then," replied Barnardo, with an expression from which it was difficult to tell whether regret or exultation was the predominant feeling of his mind. He felt a strange interest in the happiness of Clarice; yet the wild, unsated longing for vengeance upon his foe lay coiled in his heart like a venomous serpent, ready to rear its crest and hurl a deadly blow with the slightest hope of finding a vital spot on which to strike.</p> 
               <p>What to him was the daughter of Ginevra, that he should<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6335-00000086"/> shield her from the evil that threatened her? Had not her mother slighted, deserted him for another? Had she not preferred her peasant lover before both himself and the man to whom her weak heart had been tempted to pledge itself in marriage? At the tragic climax of her fate, had she not baffled him, and so successfully concealed all traces of her flight that his eager, despairing search had proved utterly unavailing? Why, then, should he spare her child? Let the harsh, cold father assert his power over her fate; let him tear her from her new-found happiness, and doom her to a separation from him to whom she had given herself. Yes, he would aid Ernesti in carrying out the cruel intent that was in his heart, and thus would his cherished plan of vengeance be assured, for dire would be the evil that must result from such a course.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN AWFUL RETROSPECT. THE FUTURE OF CLARICE SETTLED.</head> 
               <p>BARNARDO had humiliated his enemy by aiding the marriage; he would now crush him by helping him to break it; leaving to the outraged husband the vendetta a Corsican would be sure to exact for his rifled home and stolen bride.</p> 
               <p>Count Ernesti asked:</p> 
               <p>"Am I then to understand that you will assist me to regain possession of my daughter?"</p> 
               <p>"If such is your unalterable purpose, I answer yes. But, remember that, sworn enemy as I am to your house-outlaw as I have long been-I would have relented; that I would have turned from my path of retributive justice; but you urge me on against your own child; for it is against her dearest interests to tear her from her husband."</p> 
               <p>"Of that I am the best judge; and it is my inflexible determination to wrest her from her plebeian lord. I will take instant measures to have the marriage dissolved by the Pope himself, and bestow her hand on one in her own sphere of life. Aid me to find her, and I shall easily accomplish the rest."</p> 
               <p>"Be the sin then on your own head. By your own hand shall my vendetta be carried out; retribution is often slow, but is always certain."</p> 
               <p>"And why shall it not also fall on you?" asked the count, with stern emphasis. "<emph>I</emph> have merited no evil at your hands. My father may have wronged yours, but I was ignorant of the evil he wrought. I stepped between you and the woman who loved neither of us, and bitterly have I been punished for taking to my heart a being who was tempted by my rank and fortune to bear my name. It was a fatal step for both of us, but Ginevra found wretchedness in our union, and it has bequeathed to me years of remorse and anguish."</p> 
               <p>"Yet they do not seem to have softened your nature, Count Ernesti," said Barnardo, significantly. "Neither have the memories of that awful night had such an effect on mine. Since the hour in which my father's cruel fate became known to me, I have led the life of an Ishmael; my hand against every man, and every man's hand against mine. Vengeance has been the only cry to which my heart has responded, for it is the fatal heritage of my countrymen; but ages of oppression and wrong have made us what we are, and I am not accountable for the evil transmitted to me through both blood and laws. I act according to the<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6335-00000087"/> traditions of my native island, and the wild impulses of an untamed nature."</p> 
               <p>The count regarded the reckless speaker with sorrowful composure. He said:</p> 
               <p>"I would that the sacrifice of half my fortune could purchase for me immunity for the one crime that seems to rest so lightly on your soul. I daily pray before the niche in which that ghastly skeleton is walled up, but the presence of my victim follows me wherever I go. I hear his sighs in the whispers of the wind; I behold the fixed look of anguish and defiance that gleamed above those heavy stones, as they rose slowly-slowly, shutting out life, light, breath! Oh, my God! I see him before me now! I see him! I hear <emph>her</emph> agonized cries ringing in my ears!"</p> 
               <p>The speaker covered his face with his hands, as if to shut out the phantom shape evoked by his own fantasy, and steeled as the nerves of Barnardo had long been to shocks of every kind, he glanced around half apprehensively, wondering if there could be reality in the vision that seemed to be so palpable to his companion.</p> 
               <p>The large, shadowy room was unoccupied save by themselves, and with a feeling of contemptuous pity, the brigand said:</p> 
               <p>"No wonder that your hair has silvered before its time, if you have suffered such fancies to gain the mastery over you. The wretch whose life you took richly merited his fate, for he had murdered in cold blood, and the law would have condemned him to execution. We but played the part allotted to us by Fate, then let Fate bear the burden of the crime. Come-time presses, for I must go on my path before the sun declines in the West. If you desire to claim your daughter, at once arrange with me the means of communicating with her."</p> 
               <p>"Can I trust you implicitly, Barnardo?" asked the count. "You have avowed yourself my enemy, how then shall I expect you to aid me in accomplishing the wish that is dearest to my heart?"</p> 
               <p>Barnardo sneered:</p> 
               <p>"I thought I had clearly demonstrated to you that, by assisting you, I am best serving my own ends, even if they should aim at nothing less than the utter extinction of your house. Since it is your will to claim Clarice, I pledge you my word-and you know that a Corsican ever redeems that pledge-that I will aid you to the best of my ability to restore her to her birthright, though in so doing you tear-her from all that renders life valuable to her. Come-what more can you ask of me than that?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing-it is sufficient. And now, how can I send a letter to my child, in which I shall explain the causes of her long estrangement from my heart and home; in which I shall plead with her to return to me of her own free will, and abjure the wretched lot which her ignorance of her real station induced her to accept. Oh! a father pleading with his only child cannot surely fail. Her heart must yearn over the loneliness and desolation of my life, and she will not refuse to brighten my future by her presence."</p> 
               <p>"Be as sentimental as you please, my lord," said Barnardo, with that cynical hardness which is the characteristic of such men; "but I warn you that it will take much more than that to undermine the love of this young girl for Guilio Falcone. Your only chance of success lies in her vanity and pride. Clarice is beautiful, and she knows it; she has the fiery pride of your race, and may be wrought on to consider her present position as degraded as you would have her believe. I can furnish you a plan which will probably serve your purpose. Shall I develop it?"</p> 
               <p>"If you please; you can aid me materially, I doubt not."</p> 
               <p>"Guilio Falcone, like most Corsican bandits, has a chosen<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6335-00000088"/> friend and companion, who is so well fitted to become the agent in this conspiracy against your daughter. Guilio is not acquainted with the previous history of Benedetto, but I am; for a year ago I took him from Italy, a refugee from justice. His crime was a political one, which it is needless to refer to. The rank of this man is high, his family powerful, and the government will finally pardon and restore him to his estates."</p> 
               <p>"And the man himself?" eagerly asked the count. "What is he like? Can he win--"</p> 
               <p>He paused, uncertain how to go on, but Barnardo finished the sentence without scruple.</p> 
               <p>"A woman's heart? Aye, my lord, for he is handsome as Apollo, insinuating as Lucifer himself, and the complete master of every wile that can reach the feminine heart. Were she restored to her birthright, this man would be a fitting match for your daughter, and I will furthermore tell you what my keen observation showed me in the few brief moments I beheld them together. I saw, from the moment that Benedetto's eyes rested on Clarice, that one of those wild, resistless passions was lighted by her beauty, which stops at nothing till all obstacles are removed to the possession of its object. With so many perils besetting her steps, how shall this young creature escape? With the glittering temptation of rank and fortune held before her by you, a fascinating lover, madly enamored, and ready at any moment to wrest her from the arms of her husband, in the hope that she will eventually share his life and fortune. Ah! as Clarice is but a feeble girl, I fear the result of all these machinations. Poor Guilio will be thrust to the wall, and the Countess Ernesti will give her hand to the Duke of Evoli, for such I foresee will be the termination of the poor child's dream of eternal love."</p> 
               <p>The count started, and a red flush crossed his pale brow. He rapidly asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"Did I hear you aright? Is this refugee really the heir of Evoli?"</p> 
               <p>"As truly as I am here, is the Duke of Evoli in the cavern, domesticated with your daughter, and doubtless becoming more madly intoxicated with her charms with every passing hour. Fate seems to have played into your hands, and given you almost certain means of success in the undertaking you meditate. It will be a great treachery against your child; but if you choose to carry it out, it is no concern of mine."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>shall</emph> carry it out, be sure of that; and what you have just revealed only gives additional strength to my determination. As Duchess of Evoli, the rank of Clarice will be so brilliant as to cast into the shade this unhappy entanglement with the obscure outlaw with whom she so unfortunately eloped. Enlist the young duke in my interests, and offer as his reward the hand of Clarice endowed with Vivaldi's wealth. Let him entice her from her place of refuge, throw her into my power, and I pledge myself that she shall never again behold her mountain home, nor the serf who has so degraded her in bringing her to his own level. In the meantime, I will use my influence to have the attainder removed from Evoli, and the bonds that bind Clarice to Falcone broken. Both these ends accomplished, I can see my way clear to a brilliant future for my child."</p> 
               <p>The count spoke as calmly and decisively as though no hopes were to be riven, no hearts crushed in this struggle. He saw the end to be attained; the means were of trifling moment in his estimation, though in wielding his power, he should destroy the sweetest and most precious dreams that nestle in youthful and loving hearts. Barnardo said:</p> 
               <p>"I believe we fully understand each other now. You can write your letter while I stroll around the place, and renew my acquaintance with some of my old friends. In a month<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6335-00000089"/> you shall have a reply. By the time I see her again, the honeymoon will be over, and Clarice will have had ample time to weary of her lonely life. Then, perhaps the voice of the tempter may be heard; but if not quite so soon, be patient yet a little while, and the serpent will not vainly have entered her Eden. In education and accomplishments, Evoli is of course far superior to Guilio, and I feel assured that he will spare no pains to render Clarice fully conscious of this fact, while he will make every effort to arouse in her soul a consciousness of undeveloped powers, which only lack a field of brilliant display to win recognition and appreciation. The demon of discontent will thus enter her paradise, and then the way is open to you. You can lay your hand upon her fate, and mould it to your will, but I warn you to beware of the forsaken husband."</p> 
               <p>"He can easily be dealt with," said the count, haughtily. "He has few claims, either on the score of courtesy or humanity. I have removed one serf from my path by violence, then why shall I be so considerate toward another, especially when there is so much at stake in the future welfare of my daughter."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo regarded the speaker almost with a shudder:</p> 
               <p>"Truly," he said, "I have been a reckless, desperate man, for I have taken life both in cold and hot blood, but I should hesitate at the consummation of such a crime as this against my own child."</p> 
               <p>"I act for her benefit alone," replied the count, with gloomy hauteur, and he sat down to write his appeal.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo walked carelessly toward the farther end of the library, unclosed the door, and found himself, as he anticipated, face to face with Jacopo. The steward started back, grew even paler than before, and hastily retreated toward his own domains.</p> 
               <p>The pretended priest drew his hat over his eyes, clasped his hands devoutly, and followed him with quick, firm steps. When they gained a spot out of hearing from the library, the stern voice of Barnardo spoke:</p> 
               <p>"Halt there, and answer a question I have to put to you, senor stone mason."</p> 
               <p>Jacopo sharply turned, and said:</p> 
               <p>"Ha! you know my former calling? I was not, then, mistaken in thinking your face is known to me. Senor Barnardo, what has brought you hither, in that dress? Have you really taken the vows, or do you wear the priestly garb as a disguise?"</p> 
               <p>Although he made an effort to speak jocularly, his voice was slightly tremulous, and Barnardo significantly replied:</p> 
               <p>"That is no concern of yours, Jacopo. The last time we met you plied your trade to some purpose, I remember. Your services on that night secured you a fat office, and I dare be sworn that the count's coffers are none too full under your administration."</p> 
               <p>The listener evidently trembled, and he gasped:</p> 
               <p>"You were as deeply implicated as my lord or I; why, then, shall you speak of what happened then in such a tone as you now use?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I have no fear of the consequences of the crime, and you have everything to dread. Are you aware that your lord is about to reclaim his daughter? Did you overhear the information I came hither to give him? that the place of concealment found by his wife has at last been discovered."</p> 
               <p>The eyes of the steward opened to their fullest extent, and he asked:</p> 
               <p>"And my lady Countess-will he also reclaim her?"</p> 
               <p>"Death has spared him that necessity. She died within a year after her flight, but her daughter lives; she will return to the paternal home, to reign over this castle as its<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6335-00000090"/> lawful mistress. It is necessary to the accomplishment of my plans to know all that happens in this house in which your young lady is interested, after she is received beneath its roof. You know me of old, Senor Jacopo, and I tell you that on you I depend to keep a journal of events and forward it to me in the manner I shall indicate."</p> 
               <p>"But this is asking me to become a spy in the house of my master," faltered the steward.</p> 
               <p>"It matters not; the service must be performed, and faithfully, too, or you may find yourself unpleasantly brought to account for a faultless piece of mason-work performed in a certain chapel at the hour of midnight."</p> 
               <p>Jacopo wiped the cold drops from his brow. He looked into the stern, fierce face of the speaker, and humbly said:</p> 
               <p>"I only obeyed the orders of my lord, and I am not responsible for his crime. It seems to me that we are all in the same boat, and what will be fatal to me will be equally so to you and my master."</p> 
               <p>"Aye-but I am a poor wretch knocked about from pillar to post, and have no stake in the world, while the Count has his rank, his fortune and his daughter; you have a snug farm which you have bought with the pickings out of your stewardship, and a tidy little wife. You see I have kept up with you, Senor Jacopo, and I know how the land lies. Now, as you value these worldly possessions, I advise you to take heed of my words. Do you enter my service, or do you risk a refusal?"</p> 
               <p>Jacopo said with surly emphasis-</p> 
               <p>"When a bandit claps a pistol to your head, and cries 'your money or your life,' there is not much hesitation as to which shall be given; and that, I apprehend, is my case now. I have no choice but to obey you, so enlighten me as to what I am to do."</p> 
               <p>"So-o-you're reasonable at least. You are to send me a monthly bulletin of all that happens to the young Countess after she arrives here. You must tell me of her employments, her pleasures, her lovers, and how she receives them: of the state of her health, and spirits. In short, everything that concerns her."</p> 
               <p>Jacopo listened intently, and he bluntly asked-</p> 
               <p>"Senor, do you love the daughter as you did the mother, that you are so anxious to follow all her movements? It was a passion that proved fatal to Senora Ginevra; do you seek to become equally the evil genius of her child?"</p> 
               <p>"That is no concern of yours," replied Barnardo coldly. "Act as I command you without asking questions; all I require of you is fidelity in the task you have undertaken to perform. Your reward shall be immunity from punishment for the nameless deed of long ago, and a sum of money that will seem large, even to so covetous a person as you are."</p> 
               <p>At the mention of reward the eyes of the steward gleamed with sudden interest; he said-</p> 
               <p>"Oh, if anything is to be gained in serving you, of course I am your man."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo laughed harshly:</p> 
               <p>"Oh man! thou art indeed to be bought with a price! Remember our compact, Jacopo, and bide your opportunity to increase your store. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Benedicite,</foreign> my son; may the Lord have you in his holy keeping! Here comes the confessor; I must escape before his piercing eyes fall upon me, lest he sees at a glance that I am a wolf in sheep's clothing."</p> 
               <p>The approach of Father Gregory through one of the alleys leading from the chapel was seen through an open window, and the steward hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"It is the hour of my lord's confession, for this day is usually devoted to prayer, and penitence. The holy father is on his way to him now."</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6335-00000091"/> 
               <p>"Detain him until I have time to get a letter which the Count is writing. I have no wish to meet the priest, for he knew me in other days, and may chance to recognize me even in this garb."</p> 
               <p>The speaker hurried away, and, obedient to his commands, Jacopo addressed the venerable man who drew near to him, and held him in conversation till Barnado came forth and passed out of a side entrance in full view from the spot on which they stood. Father Gregory looked surprised, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has my lord the count departed from his usual custom so far as to receive a stranger in his sanctum on this day?"</p> 
               <p>"He has done so, your reverence, but this man came on business of such vital importance that he could not be refused admittance, even on this morning. I ventured to carry his credentials to my lord, and they were sufficient to entitle him to the grace that has been awarded him."</p> 
               <p>"He must indeed have come on an extraordinary mission," muttered the old man, and he passed straight on to the door of the library and knocked. It was immediately opened, and the count, in his usually severe voice, said:</p> 
               <p>"Come in, holy father, and learn that at last the curtain is lifted from the mystery that has so long shrouded the fate of my wife and child. I am at length granted the means of expiating the wrongs of that fearful night."</p> 
               <p>"In what manner, my son? Does Ginevra yet live? Can atonement be made to one who was so fearfully punished? Alas! your wife is not worthy of atonement in any shape, if she is willing to accept it at your hands."</p> 
               <p>The face of the listener clouded, and he impatiently replied:</p> 
               <p>"That record is closed. God comprehended the justice of my vengeance, and He leaves me no humiliating acknowledgment of wrong to make to her. Ginevra has slept with the saints many years, but her child yet lives; she can be reclaimed, and the noble fortune which has fallen to her will not go out of my family. The millions of the Vivaldi will go to enrich my descendants."</p> 
               <p>An expression of pain, faint but distincly marked, flitted over the features of the aged priest, but he instantly checked the feeling, and said:</p> 
               <p>"God be praised for this restoration of a long lost daughter to her father; but it involves disappointment to one in whom you are aware I have taken deep interest."</p> 
               <p>"I know, I know," replied the Count, with a haughty wave of his hand. "Liutenant Vivaldi is a protge of yours, I believe, and he hoped to claim this large estate as heir-at-law. I regret that his ignoble blood forbids such a union, or he and Clarice might jointly have enjoyed this fortune. As it is, my daughter must wed her equal."</p> 
               <p>"There would have been a yet stronger bar than inequality of rank," said the priest, meekly. "Vivaldi is already betrothed to one he adores; and I am sadly afraid that the loss of wealth will cause her parents to refuse their sanction to the marriage. The uncertainty of your daughter's existence, led them to believe that his claims upon the inheritance would never be interfered with. If, as you say, you have found your child, Vivaldi is again but a poor lieutenant of Hussars, his sword his only fortune."</p> 
               <p>The Count shrugged his shoulders.</p> 
               <p>"It is but the tide of life; a wave lifts one man to prosperity, while it engulfs another with his all in irremediable ruin. Who is the chosen bride of young Vivaldi?"</p> 
               <p>"Her father is a French exile, living on the remnant of his fortune near Bastia. Lucille inherits noble blood from her mother, but her father was a man of the people; one of those among the higher classes of the bourgeoisie who, in the days of the republic, distinguished themselves in science.<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6335-00000092"/> M. De Villeray was implicated in Bonapartist affairs, and on the restoration, his property was confiscated, and himself exiled from France. He took refuge in Corsica with such resources as he had saved from the wreck of his fortune, and at Bastia, where Vivaldi was stationed, he made the acquaintance of the family."</p> 
               <p>"You seem never to have lost sight of the lad," said the Count, with a half sneer.</p> 
               <p>"True, my lord, for once known this young man is not a person to be forgotten. Really, Tomaso Vivaldi has not done well in dealing so unequally by his nephew and niece. Both stood in the same degree of relationship toward him, yet he has given all his possessions to the female representative of the family, and left nothing to the male."</p> 
               <p>"You mistake," said the Count, superciliously. "It was not to the representative of <emph>his</emph> family that the estate was left, but to the Countess Ernesti; and only when acknowledged as such, can she claim it. The plebeian millionaire was willing to spend his days in adding coin to coin to uphold the dignity of the house into which his sister had been received as a bride; and he proved how little value he set upon his own blood, by passing over his nephew, who certainly has merit, if he possesses neither family nor fortune. Clarice must deal liberally by her cousin, and provide him with a pair of colonel's epaulettes as speedily as may be after her own reinstatement."</p> 
               <p>"The lad can make his own way to military position easy enough," replied the priest. "It is the loss of the inheritance which will mar his hopes of happiness in a union on which his heart is set. But we are strangely forgetting the duties of this day in the discussion of secular matters. Let us recall the occasion, and put on our garments of sackcloth and ashes, as did the men of old."</p> 
               <p>"I will make confession as usual," replied the count, with cold gravity, "for such is my duty; but I feel that the anger of a just God is appeased, for He permits the light of a new hope to dawn upon my dreary existence. Let us also return thanks to Heaven, that she who was lost is found; that she will be restored to her own."</p> 
               <p>"Truly, my son, I trust that your recovered daughter may prove a blessing to you, and deep cause have you to return thanks for the great mercy vouchsafed to you. I trust that the wrath of God is indeed turned from your house."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes-I feel it to be so, father," replied the count, with an expression of defiant pride very unlike his usually subdued and humble demeanor before his spiritual counsellor. "My own career has been a failure: that of my child shall compensate for my disappointments. The coronet of a duchess shall grace her brow, homage shall wait on her steps, wealth shall wrap its siren blandishments around her, and she shall look back to the humble home of her childhood with the proud distaste of the nobly born for that which is unworthy of their state."</p> 
               <p>His pale face glowed, his eyes flashed with pride, and the priest, in a low, warning tone, said:</p> 
               <p>"My son, do not indulge in sinful visions of vanity and vainglory. Tell me, does not your daughter bear the mark of the doomed ones of your race? By what means, then, do you hope to exalt her to such grandeur?"</p> 
               <p>The features of the count collapsed, and an expression of livid rage and fear overspread them. He hoarsely said:</p> 
               <p>"It was not given to <emph>her</emph> as a mark of doom, but to enable me to claim and identify the child that was stolen from beneath my roof while yet an infant. I recognize the purpose of Heaven in sealing her with the bloody cross; but it was not a fatal one. Oh no! Clarice must live; for she is the last of my race, and with her would perish an<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6335-00000093"/> ancient and honorable house, that has been known in the land since the palmy days of Roman power."</p> 
               <p>"I trust that you are right, my son," replied Father Gregory, seriously; "but if it is the will of God to cast down the high places of the earth, who can stand against Him? Let us pray that evil may pass from you and yours. When our devotions are ended, then will I ask you to explain to me how this discovery has been brought about, and we will return thanks that God has at last remembered mercy."</p> 
               <p>Vainly did the penitent endeavor to bend his mind to the duties before him. Naturally overbearing, haughty and defiant, the seclusion in which Count Ernesti had lived for years was caused as much by the insufficiency of his fortune to maintain the brilliant state in which he desired to live, as from the feelings of remorse that preyed upon his mind. He had caused his wife to be diligently sought after, from the fear that she might reveal the terrible crime he had perpetrated, but to the recovery of his child Ernesti had scarcely given a thought, until the bequest of wealth to her rendered her important in his eyes.</p> 
               <p>Then the long dormant family pride again sprang up, and impelled him to seek and claim her who was not only the heiress to his barren title and decayed estates, but the owner of untold gold, wherewith to renovate the lustre of the falling house from which she sprang.</p> 
               <p>The possibility that Clarice might refuse to claim her uncle's fortune at the price of wedded happiness he refused to entertain, and in the subsequent revelation of the position in which she stood, Ernesti carefully concealed from the priest that his daughter was the bride of a man she had voluntarily chosen. Through Father Gregory, application was immediately to be made to the Pope to annul the ignoble marriage into which he asserted Clarice had been betrayed trayed, and Ernesti doubted not that the joint efforts of the priest and himself would obtain the decree as soon as there would be any necessity to use it.</p> 
               <p>When the father arose to leave him, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I will, as you desire, write to Cardinal Monti, but if God has joined these two hearts together, will it not be better to permit them to remain as one, even if the husband is not of noble blood?"</p> 
               <p>The count proudly replied:</p> 
               <p>"<emph>God</emph> does not join together those who are unfitted in birth and fortune as mates for each other. It is my will to rescue my child from an unsuitable alliance, and I consult her best interests in so doing. Do your part, father, and I will do mine, with the hope that the blessing of Heaven will follow our efforts."</p> 
               <p>"I trust it may be so, my son," and the old man bowed profoundly and went to perform his errand.</p>

               <head type="sub">"THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH."</head> 
               <p>THE little city of Bastia lies around its harbor in the form of an amphitheatre; on the right the bay is enclosed by a gigantic rock bearing so striking a resemblance to a rudely carved lion as to have received that name. On this rock stands a gloomy fortress, built by the Genoese while they claimed rule over the Island of Corsica. From the water, the city rises in a succession of terraces, and its tower-like houses crowded closely together, and ornamented with balconies, impart an oriental air to the place.</p> 
               <p>Back of these extends a range of green mountain hights,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6335-00000094"/> covered with luxuriant groves of olive, lemon, orange, and almond trees, from the shade of which gleam abandoned monasteries, and houses of less pretentious appearance, belonging to the proprietors of the orchards.</p> 
               <p>In the garden of one of the last, upon a spot which overlooked the town and the bright waters of the sea, studded with its beautiful islands, sat two persons, who were evidently lovers. The young man was twining a wreath of fresh orange blossoms for the brow of his companion, and his dark lustrous eyes were full of tenderness, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"How long shall it be, Lucille, before I may wreath the bridal vail with these fragrant flowers? Your parents scarcely treat me well, for since the death of my uncle, there has been no excuse for deferring our marriage."</p> 
               <p>The person who thus spoke was a man of twenty-three-or-four, dressed in the becoming uniform of a French hussar, and his dark, handsome face was of the purest Italian type; the features were clearly and beautifully cut; the dark waving hair, and jet black moustache, served to set off the masculine beauty of a head that might have served as a model for a youthful Mars. His figure was light and vigorous, with that expression of power in repose which is gained by accurate military training.</p> 
               <p>The girl who listened to him with a smile and a blush, was petite, almost fairy-like in person, with a complexion of delicate fairness, and a profusion of blonde curls hanging almost to her waist. She raised her violet blue eyes to his face, and said, with an accent of gentle sweetness:</p> 
               <p>"I am the only child of my parents, Francesco, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mio,</foreign> and they are naturally averse to the thought of giving me away. We are very happy as we are, and why then shall we be in a hurry to change our present agreeable relations toward each other?"</p> 
               <p>A cloud swept over the face of the lover, and he seriously said:</p> 
                
               <p>"Then I am afraid you do not love me as you should, Lucille. My heart cannot fully accept its happiness until it is assured. I feel as if something may happen to snatch you from me yet, and I would fain have the absolute right to claim you as mine before God and man."</p> 
               <p>"Well, in good time you shall have it; but the daughter of a lady who, in her day, was a queen of fashion, cannot be permitted to marry with as little ceremony as a peasant girl. My mother has ordered my trousseau from Paris, and until the laces, silks and jewels arrive that are to adorn me as a bride, you must learn to possess your soul in patience."</p> 
               <p>"This is folly!" exclaimed the impatient lover. "Do you think I shall prize you more highly in a brocade dress, than I do in the simple muslin you now wear? Listen, darling, to my idea. Let us be married at once, without asking any of our friends to witness the ceremony; get into a travelling carriage which I will have in readiness, and make a tour through some of the picturesque regions of the island. A friend of mine has a bachelor's establishment in a lovely valley among the mountains, of which he has offered me the use for the first charming weeks of our wedded bliss. We can wander through the walks around his villa, sail upon the sea near which it stands, and enjoy that delicious calm which will enable us to know and appreciate each other more fully than we have ever done before. There we shall learn how divine a thing is perfect wedded love, with no intrusion from the outside world to mar its unity."</p> 
               <p>These words brought to the lips of the young girl a smile of tender triumph, and her eyes were lifted for a brief moment to the flashing ones that rested upon her. She said, in soft accents:</p> 
               <p>"You have sketched a beautiful picture, Francesco, which we will realize in time; but-"</p> 
               <p>She paused, as if uncertain how to complete her sentence, and the fair cheek flushed as she averted her face.</p> 
               <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6335-00000095"/> 
               <p>"But-well, what is it, my angel?" asked Francesco, impatiently. "Why shall my dream not be realized at once? While we enjoy our reality of bliss, the ship will arrive with the finery your mother considers so indispensable; and on our return, you will be ready to eclipse the gayest butterflies that flutter in the public square. At the same time, the carriage and horses I have ordered will arrive, and I flatter myself that our turn-out will be something of which even Madame Villeray will be proud."</p> 
               <p>Lucille regretfully said:</p> 
               <p>"My mother is fond of splendor, as you already know, and she will appreciate the display of which you speak. But-but, are you sure, Francesco, that you are justified in this extravagance? Is it beyond a doubt that you will inherit the wealth of your uncle?"</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi flushed, and then grew pale.</p> 
               <p>"I have permitted myself to think so. But is the slight uncertainty that attends this inheritance the true cause of the delays your parents have caused to the celebration of our marriage?"</p> 
               <p>There was a tremulous tone of wounded feeling, mingled with pique, which dictated this question, and Lucille raised her eyes pleadingly to his excited face, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"You know that I loved you before the prospect of fortune came to you; that my parents opposed my choice till you were supposed to be the heir of your rich West India uncle. They then yielded, on the condition that you shall be proved the owner of the estate before my hand is given to you."</p> 
               <p>"True, Mademoiselle; but to what is this prelude to lead?" asked Vivaldi, in a constrained tone. "Tomaso Vivaldi is dead; I am his only living relative, and therefore entitled to the fortune he left."</p> 
               <p>"So I hope and believe; but my father is not quite satisfied fied of the fact. He has written to Genoa to have enquiries made, which will either establish the validity of your claims, or-"</p> 
               <p>She paused, and her lover bitterly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Or set them aside forever. I too have written to an old friend of my family, Father Gregory, who is now private chaplain to Count Ernesti. The will of my uncle bequeaths the whole of his fortune to the only daughter of the Count, provided she is acknowledged as the heiress of his name and honors. There is a painful and humiliating story connected with this bequest. The mother of this child was the sister of my father; dazzled by the Counts station and fortune, she married him, although her heart was given to one in her own sphere of life. She was miserable in her splendid home, and finally eloped from it, carrying with her her infant daughter.</p> 
               <p>"That child has never been traced; after the laspe of so many years, it is scarcely probable that she will now be found. I look upon my accession to the property as certain; and in fact, as several months have passed since Count Ernesti was notified of the provisions of the will, and his daughter is yet undiscovered, I consider myself as the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">bona fide</foreign> possessor of the Vivaldi estate. The agent so regards it, and the income will shortly be paid to me as the heir-at-law. I am assured that Count Ernesti has moved every power at his command to regain the child for whom he cared so little till she inherited wealth, as to leave her to the chances of fate. Now, the clue is lost, and the will is void. I think I can set your father's doubts at rest by showing him a letter from Father Gregory, which reached me a few days ago. In that he states that the agents sent in pursuit of the young countess had all been heard from, save one. They had failed to trace her, and he regarded the quest as hopeless. What more can your parents ask, Lucille?"</p> 
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6335-00000096"/> 
               <p>She faltered, and after a moment's hesitation, said:</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid that my father will not permit the day of our marriage to be named till he has received a reply to his own letter of inquiry. Not that he mistrusts your assurance, but he is a man of method, and he clings to his own manner of doing business. He dreads the thought of giving me up, and avails himself of every excuse to defer the hour of separation. Ah! you do not know how much it costs this noble Spartan to relinquish his petted darling to the guardianship of another! He would be supremely happy if I would give up all thoughts of ever marrying. It was with much effort that his consent to our union was at last wrung for him, and he must really appreciate you very highly, or he would never have given it."</p> 
               <p>"I believe he does; but since M. Villeray <emph>has</emph> given it, since he has consented that I shall become his son, it is now too late to retract under any pretext. Even if my cousin is found, and restored to her rank, a father who really values the happiness of his child will not rescind the contract in which the hopes of two hearts are so deeply implicated. For me, Lucille, life has no future worth striving for, if it is not to be shared with you. If I am not Tomaso Vivaldi's heir, I am still a man who has the energy to carve his own way to fortune, whose heart beats only for you, and with you clasped to it, is equal to any fate that Heaven may send."</p> 
               <p>With an involuntary motion Lucille raised her clasped hands, and placed them in those of her lover, as she tearfully said:</p> 
               <p>"And I swear fidelity to you, Francesco, through every trial, for my heart is yours alone. But my own love, you must never exact from me disobedience to the wishes of my parents. An ungrateful daughter can never become a faithful wife; to no other will I give my hand, but on you I cannot bestow it without the full and free consent of my father and mother."</p> 
               <p>"Has it not already been given, my angel?" he impetuously asked, "and am I less worthy of so sacred a trust, even if my supposed fortune should slip from my grasp? Your father is not a sordid man; he has known reverses himself, therefore he comprehends how they can be borne by a brave soul. I will seek him now, and entreat his consent to our immediate marriage."</p> 
               <p>Lucille shook her head dubiously.</p> 
               <p>"He is not prepared for such a proposal, and my mother will oppose it. She has set her heart on the clat of a magnificent wedding, and she will not consent to forego it. Under any circumstances, my father will wait till he hears from Genoa; but, dear Francesco, I entreat that you will not take umbrage at the inquiries he has caused to be made there. It was his duty, as he understands it, to render my future as safe as possible. Alas! it is because he has known bitter reverses of fortune, and felt them keenly, that he is so anxious to secure wealth to me in the marriage I may make."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi listened with a clouded brow and pained heart. He knew that in the event of his supposed inheritance being claimed by another, Madame Villeray would use all her influence to break off the proposed marriage, for he was aware that she was intensely worldly in her views. Nobly born herself, she had played a brilliant part in the court of Napoleon. She had been an elegante, a fashionable manuverer, and a keen politician. The fall of the empire destroyed her own prestige and ruined the fortune of her husband; but the retirement in which Madame Villeray was henceforth condemned to live, had not destroyed her love of power nor the yearning desire to regain her lost position, which filled the heart of this ambitious and disappointed woman.</p> 
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6335-00000097"/> 
               <p>With sighs she looked into her mirror, and beheld the evidences of her faded beauty and increasing years, but the consoling thought came that through her daughter she might renew the triumphs of her youth, and restore the tarnished lustre of her fortunes. Lucille was an exquisite creature, lovely as a dream, but full of womanly impulses, and tender to a fault. The last must be corrected, the first made to serve her purposes, if the right kind of training was given to the possessor of such charms.</p> 
               <p>The subtle mother bent all her energies to the accomplishment of her wishes, but in spite of the worldly maxims she sought to impress upon the mind of her child, truth and nature baffled her. Lucille developed into a charming girl, with a clear perception of right and a truthful simplicity of character which all the efforts of her mother failed to warp.</p> 
               <p>This was due in a great measure to the mental training she received from her father. A philosopher, and a man of rare scientific attainments, M. Villeray believed in God only as the interpreter of nature till misfortune fell upon him with heavy force. Then he felt the need so vital to all humanity, of the All Father to whom we may carry our sorrows, and from whose divine assistance we may be enabled to bear the burdens of our earthly lot. Thus he also became a Christian, and it had been his determination from the beginning that his daughter should not struggle through the chaos by which he had arrived at the truth. Upon her opening mind he would impress the wisdom he had slowly and painfully gathered, and it should be to her a guide throughout her future life.</p> 
               <p>Lucille was the youngest of six children, and the only surviving one. Her father loved her with the utmost tenderness, and looked forward to her future with a degree of solicitude proportioned to his affection. As she grew in grace and beauty, the thought that a man younger, more attractive tive than himself, would step between himself and this darling of his life, that he would win her deepest, fondest love, was gall and wormwood to the father's heart.</p> 
               <p>Yet M. Villeray knew that his daughter must marry, and he also knew that to so sensitive a nature as hers there could be no happiness in such a relation unless her heart was unreservedly given to him on whom her hand was bestowed.</p> 
               <p>From the wreck of his fortune he had only saved a life annuity which enabled him to live in comfort in the island to which he had come as a voluntary exile. From his income he could save nothing, and with his own life the slender provision ceased. He was already in the vale of years; his health was precarious, and his tenure of existence probably brief, therefore he must sacrifice his feelings to the interests of his child.</p> 
               <p>She must enter society, and meet there those who would be likely to be attracted by her extreme loveliness. The city of Bastia did not afford many eligible alliances for a girl with such antecedents as those of Mademoiselle Villeray, but among the young nobility a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parti</foreign> might be found that would not be quite unworthy of her acceptance. Under the guardianship of the worldly-wise mother, M. Villeray thought Lucille might safely be trusted to thread her devious steps toward a proper settlement in life.</p> 
               <p>The young dbutante was soon surrounded by a bevy of lovers; several of them were cadets from the best families in the island, but unfortunately they were not endowed with fortune to sustain their ancestral honors. This, in the estimation of Madame Villeray, was indispensable. She had seen the prestige of wealth eclipse that of birth; the nobility of the sword and the banking-house had in her day taken precedence of the most ancient blood. Therefore,<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6335-00000098"/> with the shrewd mother, money must be possessed by the son-in-law she would accept.</p> 
               <p>Among the officers attached to a company of hussars stationed in the city, was a young lieutenant of singular advantages of person, and a degree of refined culture both of mind and manners, not often found among any class of men. Lieutenant Vivaldi belonged to a family that was well connected it was asserted, and he was the supposed heir of a wealthy uncle living in the island of Barbadoes.</p> 
               <p>He soon became deeply enamored of Mademoiselle Villeray, and for a season her mother received him with favor; but by some means it came to her knowledge that Vivaldi would probably be passed over in the will of his uncle, and the Ernesti family, into which an only sister had married, would inherit his fortune.</p> 
               <p>The diplomatic mother withdrew her smiles from the lately favored lover, and gave him distinctly to understand that his attentions were no longer desirable. But it was too late; these two fresh young souls, created for each other, had each already recognized its counterpart, and a passion as fervent and true had sprung up between them. Opposition only increased its power, and the poor father found his fears realized. He saw that the cherished darling of his heart loved a stranger better than father or mother.</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray could not bear this, and glad of an excuse to oppose the marriage, he eagerly listened to the sage maxims of worldly prudence uttered by his wife. She declared that Vivaldi was honorable and true, but he was no match for Lucille, for his humble origin could not be overlooked unless it was concealed by the gilding of fortune. He was not the undoubted heir of his uncle, therefore his claims must be ignored, and the gallant officer was informed that his want of fortune was an insuperable bar to his success with the object of his affections.</p> 
                
               <p>But from Lucille herself Vivaldi received the assurance that on no other would she bestow her hand, and the lovers hoped on through a season of trial which chafed the proud spirit of Vivaldi, while it deepened the trust of the heart that clung to him through all the efforts made by her mother to convince the young girl that, situated as she was, there was an absolute necessity that she should marry for position and fortune.</p> 
               <p>One day a letter came from Barbadoes which stated that Tomaso Vivaldi was dead, and if a niece who had been spirited away from her father's house seventeen years before, could not be found, Francesco Vivaldi was the heir-at-law to immense wealth. Months passed away, and the Countess Ernesti was still unfound; the agent for the estate opened a correspondence with the heir-at-law, and transmitted to him such intelligence as enabled him to take the initiative steps toward claiming the inheritance.</p> 
               <p>Such news reached Lucille forthwith, and Madame Villeray made the notable discovery that Vivaldi was the son-in-law she would have chosen in preference to every other aspirant to her daughter's hand. He only lacked fortune, and that was now supplied. The father listened to her words with a sigh; he must give up his child, yet he clung to her more fondly than ever. He consented that Lucille should marry her lover, but not before his claim to his uncle's estate was assured. The cousin might yet be found and it was evidently the duty of Lucille's friends to prevent the marriage from taking place till Vivaldi was actually in possession of his fortune.</p> 
               <p>He was received as the betrothed, and treated as the future son of the family; but every hint of a speedy marriage was put aside with such coldness as showed the unwillingness of the father to give his daughter to the keeping of another as long as it could possibly be avoided.</p> 
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6335-00000099"/> 
               <p>Letters came from Father Gregory, the early patron and steady friend of Vivaldi, assuring him that the young countess was still unfound, and in all probability would never be reclaimed by her family. The priest stated that the count himself had almost despaired of success in the search he had caused to be made, and admitted the validity of the young heir's claims.</p> 
               <p>Thus encouraged, Vivaldi renewed his entreaties for a speedy marriage; but availing himself of the slight excuse for delay, M. Villeray required time to write to Genoa himself, promising that if the inquiries he wished to make were answered in a satisfactory manner, he would no longer withhold his consent to the immediate union of the lovers.</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray did not wait for the replies; confident beforehand that they would be favorable, she despatched orders to Paris for a trousseau for the bride-elect suited to the supposed fortune of her betrothed husband, and in anticipation revelled in the splendor that would in future surround her daughter.</p> 
               <p>The lovers were perfectly happy; yet when Lucille saw how much it cost her father to behold her attachment to one he could only regard in the light of a rival in her affections, she almost shrank from the thought of giving herself to another while he yet lived.</p> 
               <p>She asked why could not Vivaldi be satisfied to bask in the sunshine of their present happiness, and look forward to their future union with the complacent belief that it would certainly take place in good time. But Vivaldi was too much in love, and of too impetuous a temperament to bear patiently a delay which he believed to be unnecessary. He had no intention of removing Lucille from her parents. He would establish a home suitable to the fortune he had inherited, and in its ample halls a suite of apartments should be fitted up for M. Villeray and his wife with every luxury and elegance that could charm the heart of the latter, while the peculiar tastes of the former should be consulted in the books and philosophical apparatus with which his library should be furnished.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A CRUSHING BLOW.</head> 
               <p>AFTER a constrained silence, Vivaldi at length spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Since you desire it so much, Lucille, I will consent to wait till the letters from Genoa arrive; but patience has its limits, and if they announce that my cousin is still unfound, I will submit to no further delay. Your father must make up his mind to give me your promised hand at once, or take from me forever the only hope that makes life valuable to me."</p> 
               <p>Before she could reply a quick, imperious voice called from the window of a tower that overlooked the garden.</p> 
               <p>"Lucille, come hither, I have news for you, and your father has letters to show Senor Vivaldi."</p> 
               <p>There was something in the tone that jarred on the hearts of both listeners, and Lucille became a shade paler, while Vivaldi flushed, and his breath came quicker as the prescience of evil fell upon him.</p> 
               <p>The voice of Madame Villeray was a good index to her feelings; when pleased, it was smooth and honeyed; when annoyed, it took a cold, sharp inflexion which cut as keenly as highly-tempered steel. Lucille grasped her lover's hand, as she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"The letters have come, and-and I fear--"</p> 
               <p>Her voice died away in a faint murmur, and Vivaldi, with some effort, replied:</p> 
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6335-00000100"/> 
               <p>"Fear nothing, my beloved-<emph>my own,</emph> for I swear to you that <emph>nothing</emph> shall now separate us. Your parents have deemed me worthy to become their son, and no mere worldly reverse can give them the right to sever us from each other. I consider you as truly bound to me as if the priest had already pronounced his blessing over us. Come, my love, let us go and see what is in store for us."</p> 
               <p>The two passed from the garden, crossed a small lawn hedged in by oleanders in full bloom, and shaded by a few pine trees. From this they approached a circular room, fitted up as both library and laboratory. A large window on one side opened to the floor, which commanded a view of the town beneath and the sea beyond.</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray, a tall, slender man, with grey hair worn away at the temples, and an anxious, weary expression in his deep-set eyes, sat in a large chair, beside a table on which several newly arrived letters were lying.</p> 
               <p>He held an open one in his hand, which he was perusing with a singular mixture of annoyance and satisfaction upon his features, while his wife uttered exclamations of anger and dismay, to which he paid not the slightest attention.</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray, in an elaborate morning toilette, which she flattered herself was perfect both in taste and fashion, flushed more highly than the rouge she wore, as she tapped her jewelled hand impatiently upon the edge of the table and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"This is too bad! All this time lost, and now the scandal of a broken marriage to end the affair! It will injure Lucille's prospects irreparably. It was bad policy from the beginning to encourage the hopes of Francesco unless he was <emph>sure</emph> of the estate. I wish we had been more prudent."</p> 
               <p>"Madame," replied her husband, with stern gravity, "the match will not be broken, it will only be deferred till Vivaldi can place himself in a position to claim my daughter's ter's hand. I am not so mercenary as to ask my child to give up the man I know she loves, because fortune has proved unkind to him. Let them be lovers still; to constant hearts, the time for reward will at last arrive."</p> 
               <p>"What, give my beautiful child to a beggarly lieutenant, whose sword is his only fortune! Monsieur, you have lived among your books until you have no idea of what is necessary to enable a girl to make a respectable marriage. In this match, I thought I had secured everything that is desirable, and here it is a wretched failure, as all my other plans have proved. I was born under an unlucky star, but this is the most bitter blow of all."</p> 
               <p>"Madame," replied M. Villeray with calm decision, "you permitted the acquaintance of these young people; under our joint sanction has ripened an affection that I feel cannot now safely be trifled with; therefore we must accept the result without useless murmurs. Vivaldi has lost the chances of fortune, but he is not on that account less worthy of our daughter; therefore I refuse to break the marriage. I only defer it, till it can with propriety be celebrated."</p> 
               <p>"I understand you very well, Monsieur," and the voice of the speaker took its sharpest inflexion. "So you keep your darling to yourself you are indifferent to her future. Lucille may grow old, lose her beauty, and with it all chances of a suitable settlement in life; and at your death, we may both starve, for I see nothing else before us. But what do you care for that, provided you can carry out your selfish plan of keeping my daughter by your side as long as your life lasts? Oh! I promise you, I see through you clearly enough."</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray listened to this voluble flow of words with less than his usual indifference to his wife's tirades, for he felt that she spoke the truth. He hastily said:</p> 
               <p>"Here come the young people. Let future events take<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6335-00000101"/> care of themselves, Madame, and do not seek to separate these lovers by a sudden and violent wrench; for I warn you that it will prove a fatal experiment. If you can undermine faith and truth, make the attempt with all the subtle power of your sex; for only by such means can you hope to succeed in the evil deed you contemplate. For the present, beware how you express yourself toward this high-spirited young man; at such a crisis as this, he will not easily forgive a slight, or an unkind word."</p> 
               <p>Thus warned, Madame Villeray impatiently bit her lip and slightly frowned as the lovers came in with their hands clasped together, and stood an instant upon the threshold, apprehensive of some evil, yet evidently firm in their allegiance to each other.</p> 
               <p>"Francesco, your letters have arrived," said M. Villeray, and his voice grew tremulous as he spoke. "I also have received one from Genoa, and from its tenor I am afraid that your bright prospects are about to be overclouded. Read and see for yourself. Come hither, my daughter, and look over these pages, for you are more deeply concerned in them than I am."</p> 
               <p>A blinding mist seemed to fall over the eyes of the young girl, and for an instant she stood as one smitten by a sudden blow; but Vivaldi strode forward with impetuous haste, and snatched up a letter addressed to himself which he saw bore the writing of Father Gregory upon it. He hurriedly tore open the envelope, and with a heart that almost ceased its beating, read the following lines:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> 
                     <body > 
                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"MY SON:-The blow may as well fall without any circumlocution, for words can never make it less heavy. The lost is found; the heiress will probably claim her own, and you, the beloved child of my adoption, must lose the wealth which should at least have been shared equally with you.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"Count Ernesti has at last received such information of his daughter as will enable him to claim her, and restore her to her true rank in life; for he is resolved that the fortune of Tomaso Vivaldi shall not be lost to his family. But for this windfall, the young girl might have lived and died in obscurity; but since fortune has chosen her for her favored child, the father's heart has opened toward her, and steps have been taken to gain control over the heiress to this magnificent inheritance.</p> 
                           <p>"But despair not, my Francesco, for all hope for you is not yet lost. The history of the young Countess is most singular and romantic, and the chances are that she may <emph>refuse</emph> both rank and fortune, to remain with a husband with whom she has lately eloped to the mountains of the very island on which you reside.</p> 
                           <p>"It seems that when your unfortunate aunt fled from her home, she took refuge in the hut of a fisherman at Isola Rossa, where she died. From that place, a few weeks ago, her daughter, ignorant of her rank, gave her hand to the son of an outlaw, who was once known as the King of the Mountains. You are probably familiar with many of his exploits, as Theodore Falcone became distinguished throughout Corsica for his wild daring and lavish generosity.</p> 
                           <p>"It seems that the son has decided to follow the same wild course of life, and the young creature who has given him her hand, declares that she will share his lot with him be it for good or for evil. The Count will leave no means untried to gain possession of her, and once in his power, her brigand lover will never be permitted to approach her again. Already has application been made to the Pope to cancel the tie that binds the heiress to Falcone, and I have no doubt that it will be promptly attended to by the Holy Father.</p> 
                           <p>"But for some revelations I have almost wrung from the<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6335-00000102"/> Count, I think it possible his daughter may resist to the bitter end, and refuse the position that must be purchased at the sacrifice of her affections. Yet, on reflection, I strongly doubt her power to do so; great wealth and high rank are too great temptations to be resisted by a frail daughter of humanity; nor can I believe that the life led by a bandit's bride will, after its first novelty is over, be found endurable by a mercurial and beautiful woman.</p> 
                           <p>"Let what may happen, I regard your chance as good, to become the eventual possessor of your uncle's estate; for by the tenor of the will it reverts to the Vivaldi family if the Countess dies without children of her own to inherit. <emph>She bears upon her breast the mark of the doomed ones of the house of Ernesti.</emph> For ages, of all who have been stamped with the bloody cross, not one <emph>has left a living descendant,</emph> and all have perished by violence.</p> 
                           <p>"Thus you see that if the present enjoyment of the estate is denied to you, its reversion will be yours; and if your betrothed is worthy of the love you have given her, she will not shrink from your side because of this reverse. Neither do I think that her parents have the right to withdraw the consent which has once been given to your union with their daughter. It will be tampering too cruelly with the most sacred rights of humanity.</p> 
                           <p>"Count Ernesti professes the most liberal intentions towards you, and you may feel assured that his daughter shall in due time be fully informed of the full extent of your claims upon the inheritance of which she deprives you. I will inform you of the result of this singular struggle between parental authority and that of the humble husband the heiress has chosen, as soon as I am myself aware of it. May the saints have you in their holy keeping, is the sincere prayer of your friend and preceptor,</p>

               <p>With many conflicting feelings was this letter read by Vivaldi; yet, amid his bitter disappointment, hope was the predominant feeling in his heart. Independence, an honorable future career, would doubtless be secured to him by the liberality of his unknown cousin; and what right had any true man to ask more of Fate? The parents could not be so unreasonable as to refuse Lucille to him, even if the prospect of great wealth was denied him.</p> 
               <p>In the meantime Lucille had regained sufficient composure to read the few lines which her father's letter contained. They were:</p>

                           <p>"MONSIEUR VILLERAY:-Your inquiries respecting the succession to the Vivaldi estate came just at the right moment for a satisfactory reply. Count Ernesti has at last discovered the retreat of his daughter, and taken such steps as will lead to her restoration to the rank in which she was born.</p> 
                           <p>"Of course, the estate of Tomaso Vivaldi then goes according to the provisions of the will, and his nephew gets nothing, unless the heiress is liberal enough to remember his claims, and to help him along in the career he has chosen.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>The small hand that rested on M. Villeray's shoulder trembled, and the tremor crept to the heart of the old man, for he felt that the whole future happiness of his darling was staked upon the issue of this interview.</p> 
               <p>The two men looked into each other's eyes, and each read the soul of the other, but the clear, cold voice of the mother here interposed.</p> 
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6335-00000103"/> 
               <p>"Well, you have both read the news, and you understand the position into which we have all thrust ourselves. If I had not considered this estate as good as your own already, Senor Vivaldi, I should never have permitted you to dream for an instant of winning the hand of my daughter. As a man of honor, I call on you to relinquish all pretensions to her at once."</p> 
               <p>"Mother! oh, mother!" burst from the pale lips of Lucille, in deprecating accents, and Vivaldi, white with passion, said:</p> 
               <p>"Every impulse of truth and honor forbids me to pursue the course you demand, Madame. Your daughter loves me, I adore her, and my position is not such as renders me an unsuitable match for Mademoiselle Villeray, even without the fortune of my deceased uncle. My pay is sufficient for a respectable support, and I shall doubtless obtain promotion before very long."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Respectable support!</emph>" repeated Madame Villeray, in accents of supreme scorn; "and do you suppose that a young girl of noble descent, of transcendent beauty and brilliant accomplishments, is to throw herself away on one who can only offer her a <emph>respectable support?</emph> Truly, my laundry-maid or cook might be satisfied with such a prospect, but not the daughter of Pauline de Rochefort. Your supposed wealth, Senor Vivaldi, was all that, in my estimation, lifted you to an equality with my child. Without that, you are simply a lieutenant in the French service, and the penniless cadet of a bourgeois Italian family. Thus, as a man of the world, you must see how impossible it is that your pretensions can be sustained a single moment after your true position is understood."</p> 
               <p>The lovers turned their eyes imploringly upon the father, but he seemed wavering between respect for the opinions of his wife, and fears for the future happiness of the trembling girl who clung to him as her last anchor in this struggle between avarice and honor. Vivaldi proudly said:</p> 
               <p>"If not of noble blood, I at least have had the training of a gentleman, and no man can say that, either in manners or morals, would I discredit the lineage of a prince. As a <emph>man,</emph> the mere possession of wealth could not render me more worthy of the heart I have won. Madame, I warn you that such love as exists between Lucille and myself cannot be thwarted with impunity. If we cannot live for each other, we can die for the sake of that love. I in the battle's front, for I will throw away the life that is forbidden to be passed with her; she will perish in solitary pining, because the light of her life is extinguished."</p> 
               <p>"Bah! sentimental nonsense! I know how much such words are worth. You will seek and find a wife dowered with the money you need, and Lucille will give her hand to one at least in her own sphere. If he possesses wealth, so much the better, but both fortune and birth cannot be dispensed with in her future husband."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi offered her the letter of Father Gregory as he haughtily said:</p> 
               <p>"Read this, Madame, and learn that I have not yet lost all chance to inherit my uncle's estate. Two throws in my favor are still upon the dice; one soon to be decided, the other must be left to the chances of the future."</p> 
               <p>The worldly-wise woman eagerly grasped the letter, ran her eyes rapidly over its contents, and after a moment of indecision, said in her hardest tones:</p> 
               <p>"There can be but one course taken in a matter of this kind. No woman in her senses can doubt what the decision of the heiress will be. On one side rank, wealth, and luxury; on the other, the dreary privations of an outlaw's home. She would be mad to hesitate a moment. The writer of this letter is superstitious, and he thinks that a<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6335-00000104"/> hereditary curse clings to this young girl because she bears a family mark which has hitherto been regarded as fatal to its possessor. On these grounds, Father Gregory believes that the Vivaldi estate may yet be yours; but should this prove true, your cousin is younger than you are; she may outlive you, even if she leaves no direct heir to claim the inheritance. What I desire, what I must have for my child, is actual, tangible wealth that can be enjoyed <emph>now;</emph> I am not satisfied with a vague promise in the future. I have not deceived you, Senor, for I did not encourage you to hope to win the hand of my daughter, until I was assured there could be no doubt that the fortune of your uncle would descend to you. Do not accuse me of being mercenary, when I am only prudent. It is my duty to take care of my daughter's future."</p> 
               <p>The lovers, seeing no hope from this quarter, turned toward the irresolute father. Vivaldi asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is this also your decision, M. Villeray? Have you no sense of justice toward us? Your affection for your child should teach you that her happiness must not be sacrificed in this arbitrary manner."</p> 
               <p>"I-I cannot quite agree with Madame Villeray," he slowly replied. "We are equally bound to consider the future welfare of our daughter; but I do not find it in great wealth, as my wife seems to do. Your marriage must be postponed, but it is not broken off. When your promotion is <emph>gained,</emph> we will then see."</p> 
               <p>Lucille pressed his hand tenderly, but with a clouded brow, Vivaldi said:</p> 
               <p>"Since I can gain nothing more, I must even accept this concession as gratefully as I can; but if I did not love your daughter better than my life, I would at once break off an engagement which may drag on for months, or even years, till all the life and freshness of our being is exhausted, and only the lees left for wedded happiness. M. Villeray, have I your distinct pledge that when my promotion is secured, you will no longer refuse me the possession of the hand I have so long been permitted to consider as my own?"</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray looked helplessly toward his wife, but she thought she had spoken quite plainly enough, and gave him no further assistance. After a pause, he said:</p> 
               <p>"If you both remain unchanged, and still desire the marriage, I answer, yes."</p> 
               <p>With a glad smile Lucille held out her hand; Vivaldi clasped it in both his own, and placing it over his heart, fervently said:</p> 
               <p>"This hand I hold as sacredly mine as if the church had already bestowed upon us its nuptial blessing; and I here declare that no earthly power shall break the bond of union between Lucille and myself. We belong to each other, and woe betide him who may seek to sever us."</p> 
               <p>The sharp voice of Madame Villeray interposed:</p> 
               <p>"I presume, senor, that you will at least allow my daughter the liberty of retracting should the bond prove a galling one, as it is not unlikely to become in the future."</p> 
               <p>"Madame, when the heart of my betrothed recoils from the contract, she has only to signify as much to me, and I free her from that instant," replied the lover with defiant pride, for his trust in the object of his affections was as deep and firm as it was tender.</p> 
               <p>The mother smiled triumphantly.</p> 
               <p>"All is right, then. We shall see-we shall see, whether silly sentimentality or common sense in the management of affairs, is to carry the day yet. Good morning, Senor; my best wish for you is speedy disenchantment and a return to the sober realities of life. Come with me, Lucille; I wish to have your company in my own room."</p> 
               <p>Thus commanded to depart, the young girl pressed her<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6335-00000105"/> lover's hand, looked beseechingly in his eyes, and unwillingly accompanied her mother to a conference she dreaded.</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi remained closeted with M. Villeray some time longer, but he finally left with a gloomy brow, and a defiant curl of the lip which proved that the facile father, much as he was attached to his daughter, had not sufficient nerve to set the stronger will of his wife at defiance, and pursue the only course that could secure the happiness of the lovers.</p> 
               <p>Poor Lucille, with a sick heart and despondent hopes, listened to a long lecture on the proprieties of life, which ended with the assurance that among them the marriage of a well born and beautiful girl with a penniless officer was not included. She was assured that she must make up her mind to give up her lover, and the sooner this was done the better it would be for all parties concerned in this unfortunate imbroglio.</p> 
               <p>Lucille never opposed her mother in words. She was too gentle and too dutiful for that; but hers was that silent, passive resistance to the unjust assertion of authority, which is unyielding as a wall of iron. While Madame Villeray flattered herself that she was convincing the reason of her daughter, and submission to her dictates must soon follow, the heart of Lucille, in every resolute throb, held fast her faith and truth to the lover she had chosen.</p> 
               <p>Life and hope might perish in the struggle, but true to her plighted vows she would remain, in defiance of every effort to render her unfaithful to them. From her mother she had inherited the very strength of will which was now set against her wishes; and when two such natures come in direct collision, it was easy to see that neither would yield an inch of vantage ground. The elder lady from obstinacy, and the preconceived idea that she had a right to settle the destiny of her child, would persist to the last; the younger one, from the deep sense of honor which had been the gift of her father, would maintain the position she had assumed in defiance of every attempt to alienate her from Vivaldi.</p> 
               <p>At the conclusion of her harangue, Madame Villeray looked at the pale, set face of her daughter, and added:</p> 
               <p>"You see it must be so, Lucille. Young love, and romantic dreams, are well enough in their way; but they will not give you a villa, servants, and a carriage. These are things to which you are entitled, and the man that marries you <emph>must</emph> possess them. Senor Vivaldi is attractive and interesting, I admit; but he is too poor to look so high. You fully comprehend me, I hope, child."</p> 
               <p>There was a sharp accent in her voice which Lucille understood very well; she only said, in a low tone:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Madame, I believe I do; and now, if you please, I will retire to my own room."</p> 
               <p>"Go then; I am tired of talking, and after all it's not of much use. You will learn from the future that I am perfectly in earnest, and mean every word I have said."</p> 
               <p>Lucille merely bowed her head as she glided from the room, but in her heart was the rebellious thought that she too was in earnest, and had not the slightest intention of being dragooned into relinquishing her betrothed.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE WARNING.</head> 
               <p>THE days passed as a happy dream to the enchanted Clarice; and, truly, no princess in a fairy tale could have had more bewildering surprises than awaited the Pearl of Isola Rossa in her new abode.</p> 
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6335-00000106"/> 
               <p>Accompanied by Guilio, she learned to scale the mountain hights; to fire a light carbine, which even her delicate hand could soon wield with the skill of a practised sportsman, though, to tell the truth, her lip quivered, and her eyes filled with tears, when her first feathered trophy fell fluttering and wounded at her feet.</p> 
               <p>Hers was a tender woman's heart, and death by violence to the meanest creature God has made was painful to her.</p> 
               <p>Benedetto, or Evoli, as we now know his true name to be, remained but few days with the newly-wedded pair; unwilling to witness a happiness in which he could not share, he wandered away on some expedition of his own, leaving the lovers to enjoy that bliss which he had already determined should not be very lasting.</p> 
               <p>Evoli was the sworn comrade of Guilio, yet the first glance he had cast upon his bride had kindled in his undisciplined nature a passion as violent and irresistible as were all the impulses of his being. Born to almost princely rank, in a country in which fiery will is ever dominant over principle, to wish and to act had ever been his custom; and now the slight barrier of his friendship for Guilio interposed but a trifling obstacle to the consummation of the treachery he meditated.</p> 
               <p>Implicated in a political conspiracy, which for a season compelled him to remain in hiding, Evoli knew that steps had already been taken to restore him to his former position. He now impatiently awaited the arrival of that hour of freedom, as his restoration to rank and fortune would enable him to offer such temptations to the object of his passion, as he believed no daughter of Eve would possess firmness to resist.</p> 
               <p>Evoli believed that with his beauty of person, his power to charm every one that approached him, he could win the heart of this lovely creature from the crude, unformed youth to whom she had given herself; he would bear her to his splendid home, and surround her with the elegance she was formed to appreciate and adorn. That he should succeed, he did not permit himself to doubt, for had he not hitherto proved himself irresistible to every woman he had desired to please? He knew that in his seductive voice, graceful accomplishments, and devotion to the sex, he bore with him a fascination which had hitherto carried everything before him. No-he would not be baffled now; struggle as she might, Clarice should surely be separated from her mountain lord, and become the companion of his flight from Mont Rimbombo, as they had named their cavern, from the constant reverberations of the waves which dashed against its base.</p> 
               <p>During the following weeks, Evoli came and went at intervals, always making himself charming on his return, and carefully timing his departure in such a manner as to leave regrets behind him. Already he saw the first repulsion Clarice had evidently felt towards him was quite overcome, and he confidently looked forward to the time when those soft eyes would light up with tender welcome at the sound of his approaching footsteps.</p> 
               <p>Marie Montoni, on one of her dreamy spells, followed the steps of her young friends, taking no part in their pastimes, nor often conscious of their occupations. The anniversary of the loss of her lover had come around, and she spent her days in wandering about after Clarice, carrying a rosary in her hand, over which she muttered prayers for the repose of the soul of her lost one, and gazing afar off into space, as if seeking his impalpable form in the mists which floated around the mountain hights. She rarely spoke, and ate so little that it was marvellous how her strength was sustained. Occupied with each other, Guilio and his bride suffered Marie to wander at her will, and indulge her dreamy reveries without interruption.</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6335-00000107"/> 
               <p>Clarice did not forget the promise of Guilio to reveal to her the wonders of the grotto that lay at the base of the cavern, and with every visit her delight increased. Three weeks had passed away since her arrival at Mont Rimbombo, and the young bride had not yet experienced an emotion of lassitude or weariness. She believed her happiness would always be as great as now-her enjoyment of the passing moment as vivid and as fresh as at first.</p> 
               <p>Clarice was too young and inexperienced to dream of disenchantment; and she was thus far fortunate, that once in her life at least she enjoyed a period of cloudless happiness more like the radiant dream vouchsafed to our first parents in the garden of Eden, than the usual dull realities of existence. She quaffed the wine of life from an overflowing goblet in which the pearl of joy and hope was dissolved.</p> 
               <p>The day had been one of unusual brightness, and as the dazzling sun dipped toward the western horizon, Clarice arose from her afternoon siesta, and proposed to Guilio to seek the cool shadows of the grotto. He gladly acquiesced, for he had been impatiently awaiting her awakening to propose the same thing. Marie declined accompanying them, on the plea of the fatigue of the descent; and leaving her in possession of their leafy dining-hall, the pair passed through one of the adjoining caverns to an entrance hollowed in the floor.</p> 
               <p>A heavy rock turned upon a pivot, and revealed a narrow flight of steps even more rugged than those which led into the cave from above, and Guilio took a lamp to light them on their way. The pathway had evidently been excavated through the solid rock by infinite labor, and a tradition existed that it had been done ages before by Saracen invaders, who thus sought to open a communication between the marine grotto and the caverns above. But they were discovered just as they had nearly completed their labors, driven back with great slaughter, and such precautions taken as effectually concealed the entrance from the sea.</p> 
               <p>Accident revealed its existence to Theodore Falcone, and its knowledge had descended to his son through an old comrade of the renowned outlaw. The passage was barely wide enough to admit the form of a large man, and in many places the steps were mere notches cut in the rock, which gradually sloped downward till the lower aperture was gained.</p> 
               <p>Clarice, by this time familiar with the rugged way, lightly followed her husband, only needing the aid of his hand occasionally, when the steps were unusually steep and broken. When they gained the last one, Guilio placed the lamp in a niche on one side, pressed his hand upon a small knob, and the way opened before them into a scene of fairyland.</p> 
               <p>They stood upon the threshold of a temple magnificently arched and ornamented with pendant stalactites of infinite beauty and variety. It was lighted by a rift in the wall above, through which the clear blue sky shone down upon the translucent water which formed the flooring of this marine grotto, and reflected the various gleams of color thrown upon its surface. In one place it was of a pale green tint, in another it was shaded to a deep black, in other spots gleaming with azure and rose-colored tints, blending with each other in wondrous harmony.</p> 
               <p>The water was so transparent that away in its depths were seen sea shells and grasses, with fish swimming among them as if conscious of their safety from the arts of the angler in this sheltered retreat. Through the aperture in the roof, the luxuriant verdure of the climate had found its way, and long tendrils of the picturesque grape vine, mingled with flowering creepers, drooped down the sides of the grotto, and twined themselves around the glittering<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6335-00000108"/> columns, thus offering a type of architectural grace and elegance which mortal man must despair of excelling.</p> 
               <p>Near the edge of the water, successive ledges of rock afforded a safe pathway for the visitor when the sea was calm; but when a storm raged, the waves dashed above them, and gave no place of refuge to human feet. On this evening not a breath rippled the calm surface, and Clarice gazed with silent rapture upon a scene that so strongly appealed to that sense of the beautiful which was the most salient feature of her mind.</p> 
               <p>A light boat, gaily painted, was moored close to the entrance, and crimson cushions lay piled up in it, which had been placed there for the accommodation of the young bride. While Guilio loosened the chain which secured his fairy shallop, Clarice looked back into the gloomy passage by which they had just descended, and with a deep breath, said:</p> 
               <p>"Coming hither is like passing through Hades to gain Heaven. Can anything on earth be more beautiful than this temple made by a viewless architect, who puts all our proudest efforts to shame?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is grand and noble," replied Guilio, "and I always feel, on entering this place, as if we should raise a hymn of praise to Him who created it. Benedetto sings magnificently; he and Marie must come hither with us, and give us a grand refrain which will wake up the mermaids from the ocean depths, and draw them into our enchanted hall."</p> 
               <p>"That will indeed be magnificent. When does Benedetto return?"</p> 
               <p>"I look for him with every passing hour, nor do I know what detains him from us. He is probably watching for the return of Barnardo, who is to bring us such grand news of your family and fortune."</p> 
                
               <p>"He is very kind, if that alone takes him away," murmured Clarice. "But so far as I am concerned, it is of little consequence. I have chosen my lot, and I am contented with it, which I fancy is not the case with many of earth's children."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, love, but you are becoming quite a little philosopher. Benedetto does not go to meet Barnardo on your account alone. He came from Italy, and it is now many months since he joined me here. Of late he has become very restless, and anxious about news from his friends."</p> 
               <p>"Who, then, is Benedetto?" asked Clarice, abruptly. "He possesses a grace of manner and beauty of person I have not remarked in any other man, and his accomplishments are singularly varied."</p> 
               <p>A faint shadow swept over the brow of Guilio, but it was instantly chased away, and his clear eye met that of Clarice with a roguish twinkle, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"So, Senora Eve, you have proved your relationship to the first woman already, but I hope your curiosity will not be gratified at the cost of hers. Your shrewdness has detected what I do not care to conceal from you. Benedetto is a man of high position, and when he regains his own, he will prove a powerful friend to you and me."</p> 
               <p>"He is, then, noble?" she asked, with a sudden flush of color as she propounded the last word.</p> 
               <p>Guilio laughed, and teasingly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Is it not enough to know that he is noble in nature, without caring to hear of the long descent to which men attach such importance?"</p> 
               <p>"True-yet still we involuntarily render more respect to those doubly endowed by birth and fortune, than to the most nobly gifted ones without these adventitious aids. Ah me! mean as it is, I am afraid I am not quite free from this weakness myself."</p> 
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6335-00000109"/> 
               <p>Guilio sorrowfully regarded her as he slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"And with this weakness, Clarice, if you should prove to be a woman of rank and fortune yourself, what is to be the end of our dream of bliss? Temptation has not yet assailed you; when it comes, how will you meet it?"</p> 
               <p>Clarice had spoken in a half dreamy manner, but Guilio's words startled her into full consciousness of the effect her words had produced. She slightly stooped forward, pressed her lips upon the brown hand that was extended to assist her into the boat, and with an accent of inimitable grace, said:</p> 
               <p>"Under any, every circumstance, you are king of my fate, lord of my heart, my Guilio. No fortune can be too high to be shared with you, no temptation great enough to sever me from you. I ask nothing, will accept of nothing, that is not equally yours. Benedetto is handsome and elegant, but you are true and beloved. See, I do not compare you with each other, for in my heart there is no room for such a thought."</p> 
               <p>The passing shadow flitted away, Guilio clasped her tenderly in his arms, and lifted her into the boat. With loving care he arranged her cushions and placed her upon them; then, taking a pair of oars from a nook in the rock, he pushed his fairy bark out upon the waters.</p> 
               <p>With that love of effect which was innate with Clarice, she had thrown over her light dress a white lace veil that fell in filmy folds around her neck and shoulders. As she reclined against the crimson cushions in an attitude of exquisite grace, her striking face, with its marble white complexion, large, lustrous eyes, and wealth of burnished hair bound in heavy braids around her elegantly moulded head, offered a picture as rare as it was beautiful to the eyes of her fascinated and adoring lover.</p> 
               <p>A more patrician looking creature could not have been imagined, and there was in the proud curve of the lips, in the veiled fire of the eyes, the unquenchable spirit of ambition and love of power which now lay latent in her untried nature. Untempted, it might never have been developed, but with the opportunity to grasp the glittering prizes of life once offered to her acceptance, who could say what the final result might be? To such a nature, dire would be the struggle even between her love for Guilio, and the brilliant lures of wealth and high station, in that world her fancy pictured in all its attractiveness to youth and inexperience.</p> 
               <p>Possessing that voluptuous temperament which loves to lap itself in luxury; a grasp of mind which already felt that the gifts of nature had been poorly cultivated in the humble sphere in which she had been reared, Clarice felt that if justice had been done to her natural gifts, she would have been something far superior to her present self. With her quick intuition, she saw at once that Evoli was a being of different grade from those with whom she had hitherto been cast, and as day after day unfolded to her the certainty that the elegance and luxury with which she was surrounded resulted from his taste, and his efforts to prepare the cave for her reception, she learned to regard him as a superior being, gifted with the power of the genii to produce magical effects. In his perfect confidence in his friend, Guilio lavished praises upon him, and unhesitatingly revealed that to Evoli's taste and skill he had implicitly trusted in making his preparations for the reception of his bride.</p> 
               <p>Evoli had now been absent nearly a week, and both husband and wife began to look forward to his return with a degree of pleasure which neither would have been willing to admit to the other. In truth, the first glamour of passion was past; they had conjugated the verb to love in all its phases, and in the calm which followed the transport of a perfect union, the monotony of their secluded existence<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6335-00000110"/> began to be vaguely felt, and both unconsciously desired the return of Evoli from the outside world with tidings of what was passing in it, though neither would willingly have acknowledged that in the society of the other all was not found that was needed for happiness.</p> 
               <p>Eden itself did not content the first man and woman, though they were fresh from the hand of God, and ignorant of evil; why, then, should we hope that two beings of passionate impulsive southern temperament, could find, even in this romantic solitude, that perfect contentment for which humanity has vainly sighed?</p> 
               <p>Clarice began to think of her unknown family and fortune; to build castles in the air which were always inhabited both by Guilio and herself; but in those visions she was ever a lady of high degree, with vassals at her command, and wealth wherewith to maintain her lofty state.</p> 
               <p>As she now floated over the lucent waters, and idly played with them with her white fingers, a gorgeous dream of future grandeur arose before her fancy, and she yearned for the arrival of Barnardo, that she might learn the actual position she was henceforth to hold in that busy world whose hum had faintly reached her in her cottage home.</p> 
               <p>Guilio, too, began to be restless, and anxious for his return, but from a different cause. He feared the development that might be made concerning the rank of his bride, for he knew enough of life, of the pride of the nobles, to feel assured that Clarice would be compelled to choose between himself and the station to which she was born. He did not for an instant doubt her decision, but he asked himself how he should atone to her for what she must relinquish to remain with him?</p> 
               <p>To Guilio's generous nature this was a painful question, and as he looked on her now in her pride of beauty, he felt deep in his exacting soul that if she wavered in her choice, in his jealous frenzy he would be capable of the most terrible vengeance even upon her. He shivered and checked the thoughts that arose within him. Why should he dream of evil on this evening, when everything around him was attuned to happiness? Clarice should see no cloud upon his brow, no mistrust in his manner, for that, in this crisis, would deeply wound her loving heart.</p> 
               <p>He shook off the weight that was falling upon him, raised a clear, melodious voice, and sang a barcarole as he rowed the boat from point to point, that Clarice might see the tiny rills of water slowly trickling down the walls, which in the progress of ages had slowly hardened into the sparry incrustations of every variety of form that now ornamented them.</p> 
               <p>The grotto was an irregular ellipse, enclosing an area of many hundred feet. The outlet toward the sea was so low, and so matted over with vines and shrubbery, that from without its existence was unsuspected, save to the few who were aware of its locality. At low tide, by lying down in the boat, the rowers could pass through it, but when the sea was as its highest mark there was only a faint line of light which revealed its position to those within the grotto. Such was now the case, and when Guilio rowed close to the outlet, Clarice, with all her efforts, could only obtain a glimpse of the sea beyond. She impatiently asked:</p> 
               <p>"When will you take me through this entrance, Guilio? I wish to see the Titanic grandeur of the rocks piled as a barrier against the waves, of which you have told me."</p> 
               <p>"Whenever it is safe to do so, my angel. The tide is coming in; hear the billows how they dash and roar against the granite barrier of our fairy palace, while we sit calmly within our shallop, gently rocked by their <unclear>undulations</unclear>."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! it is a grand refrain, and better suited to this spot than any music with which we can fill its stately walls. To<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6335-00000111"/> render the place perfect, Venus should rise from the sea in her shell of pearl, surrounded by beautiful mermaids who would join their voices with the grand chorus of ocean spirits that seem ceaselessly to wail the fate of those given as a prey to the remorseless deep. Ah! I can almost fancy I behold them rising from the transparent water!"</p> 
               <p>Guilio laughed gaily.</p> 
               <p>"I do indeed see Venus, though the attendant nymphs are wanting; but it matters not to me, Clarice, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mia;</foreign> the goddess suffices in herself."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I know I am your goddess now, but how long will my divinity last? The moon of bliss has almost waned, and when that is gone, the wine of life has lost its first exquisite flavor," she pensively replied.</p> 
               <p>"Not with us shall it be thus," earnestly responded Guilio. "Our love shall brighten and grow stronger as we walk hand in hand upon the path we have chosen to tread together. Only let us be true to each other, my Clarice."</p> 
               <p>"That I am sure we will be through every trial, every temptation," was the emphatic response, and Clarice believed sincerely that she spoke the truth.</p> 
               <p>Guilio replied to this assurance by an eloquent glance of confidence and perfect love, and again the delicious calm of undoubted faith in each other cast its gis over those two hearts that might have lived in perfect union but for the disturbing influences that were drawing near even during those moments of serene happiness.</p> 
               <p>Clarice at length said:</p> 
               <p>"I am surprised that the existence of this grotto has not become known to smugglers, and been used by them to conceal contraband goods."</p> 
               <p>A deep flush mounted to the brow of Guilio, which was succeeded by a momentary paleness. He compressed his lips, as he glanced searchingly at the face of his companion ion. She was not at that moment looking at him, but appeared absorbed in contemplating the beauties of the scene around her. With slight effort he said:</p> 
               <p>"There are caverns situated near this better suited to such a purpose, which are known to be used by them. But the entrance to this one is so well concealed that I have no reason to suppose its existence is known, save to myself and two faithful friends. But even if chance should reveal it, the outlet toward our own eyrie is too well concealed to afford any clue to our stronghold. We are as safe in our mountain home, as if we had emigrated to the moon."</p> 
               <p>"I am thankful for that, for at times I have fears that the relatives of Matra may seek to avenge on you the sad event of our bridal day."</p> 
               <p>"I'll not be troubled on that score, Clarice; for I am free from the crime of blood-guiltiness, and the Madonna will not send its punishment upon me. Twilight begins to deepen around us, love; shall we ascend, and seek Marie once more?"</p> 
               <p>She sighed and looked around, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I could spend hours in dreaming in this exquisite place. I am never willing to leave it, but I suppose we must go, or Marie will think we have too long deserted her."</p> 
               <p>With slow and gliding motion, Guilio propelled the boat to the spot from which he had taken it, and after fastening the chain that secured it, said to Clarice:</p> 
               <p>"Examine the wall, and see if you, who are aware of the existence of the entrance, can find where it is situated."</p> 
               <p>She gave a minute survey to the rugged surface, and said:</p> 
               <p>"It is impossible to point out the exact spot in which it is situated. I can never find it without your assistance."</p> 
               <p>"Nor I, without this landmark," replied Guilio, pointing to a small notch cut into the rock near the edge of the<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6335-00000112"/> water. "A line carried from this mark in a direction ten feet toward the left, will point to the outlet. See," and he proceeded in the direction named, placed his hand upon the spring which held it fast, and the door unclosed, showing the abrupt passage faintly illuminated by the lamp which had been left within it.</p> 
               <p>After a toilsome ascent they reached the upper cavern, and found Marie sitting upon the platform which looked toward the sea. Her dreamy air was gone, together with the rosary which of late had been her constant companion; a faint color gleamed upon her cheeks, and with an appearance of re-awakened interest she pointed to a white-winged felucca in the distance.</p> 
               <p>"There comes Barnardo. He brings you news of your family, Clarice. I feel that a change is about to fall upon us, but whether for better or for worse my prescience does not enable me to foresee. Ah! why is this clouded vision given to me? It would be better to live like others in the dark than have imperfect and deceptive gleams of light vouchsafed to me."</p> 
               <p>"Do not give way to your strange fancies, then, Marie," said Guilio, bluntly. "Any change to Clarice and myself must be for the worse, for are we not perfectly happy as we are, and ask for nothing that Fate has not given us? Is it not so, Clarice, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mia?</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly," and Clarice smiled softly upon him; but still her heart throbbed tumultuously at the approach of Barnardo with tidings of such importance to herself.</p> 
               <p>The three watched the swift motion of the vessel, and calculated the time that must elapse before the sailor could reach the trysting place appointed for a meeting between himself and Guilio; for the latter had no idea of betraying to the smuggler the secret entrance to his mountain home.</p> 
               <p>He brought out his pocket telescope, and found that Marie's keen eyes had not deceived her; the Violante was flitting toward the coast, and no time was to be lost in setting out for the point at which he was to meet Barnardo. Clarice entreated for permission to accompany him, but this Guilio gently yet firmly refused, with the assurance that the distance was too great, and the way too rough for her to walk without extreme fatigue.</p> 
               <p>As Guilio was preparing to leave, Marie, who had retired to her own apartment, re-entered, wrapped in her black faldetta, and said:</p> 
               <p>"My mind is made up to return to Isola Rossa by the first opportunity. From there I must go to Bastia, to visit one who was a friend to me in the darkest days of my misfortunes. Something tells me that sorrow has entered his house, and I must go thither to satisfy myself if such is the fact."</p> 
               <p>"And leave Clarice without a female companion?" asked Guilio in dismay. "I have hoped and trusted that you would remain here as our friend and sister, Marie."</p> 
               <p>"I will return again, and that soon; but Clarice knows that I cannot abide long in one place. Since-since I was crushed by sorrow, change of scene has become necessary to me. I have stayed my time out here, and now I must go."</p> 
               <p>Clarice looked pleadingly at her, and would have added her entreaties to those of Guilio, but something in the face of the half demented woman warned her that she spoke the truth. The cavern had become a prison to her, and she must wander over the free earth, until the necessity for repose again led her wandering steps to its shelter. She resignedly said:</p> 
               <p>"I see it is inevitable, Marie, and for a season I must give you up. But you must return as speedily as may be, for I shall sadly miss your companionship."</p> 
               <p>"One is coming who will more than fill my place,"<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6335-00000113"/> replied the girl in a low, significant tone. "Be careful, Clarice, darling, how you hearken to his tempting voice lest it may lead you astray."</p> 
               <p>"Impossible!" was the indignant response, uttered with crimsoning cheeks and flashing eyes. "How can you suspect me of being capable of such baseness?"</p> 
               <p>"I only warn you, my friend. Keep the faith you have plighted pure and bright, and all will be well."</p> 
               <p>Guilio was filling his pockets with figs and bread, and he advised Marie to follow his example, for they had a long walk before them, over a road rugged enough to sharpen any appetite. This she did, and after a tender parting from Clarice, the two threaded their way to the upper cavern.</p> 
               <p>It was not yet dark, and the goats and sheep were coming in, in pairs, driven by the herdsman. A few words from Guilio informed him of whither they were bound, and with a gay smile, Angelo said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope, Senor, that you will bring back the Senor Benedetto with you. His handsome face and cheery voice are missed by us all when he stays away longer than usual."</p> 
               <p>"I think it probable he will return with me, Angelo," and they passed on their way.</p> 
               <p>"It is strange," said Guilio, after a long pause, "what a charm Benedetto seems to carry with him. Every one he approaches seems ready to fall down and offer him homage."</p> 
               <p>"Some persons possess that fatal kind of magnetism," replied Marie, gravely. "I trust in his case that it will be used to no evil purpose."</p> 
               <p>"Evil! Marie! Benedetto is the soul of honor. He is hiding from no taint of crime, or dishonor. It is only a political difficulty that keeps him here."</p> 
               <p>"Then, as I suspected, he is a man of rank. Guard well the dove of peace that now nestles in your bower, Guilio, and let no high-born gallant lure it from its true home."</p> 
               <p>Guilio flushed deeply, and he fiercely asked:</p> 
                
               <p>"What can you mean, Marie, by seeking to infuse suspicion into my mind against the two beings I love best on earth?"</p> 
               <p>"I only warn you against possibilities-nothing more. Take my words as they are meant, Guilio, and do not get angry with me for speaking what I am impelled to utter."</p> 
               <p>Guilio glanced at her colorless face, with its fixed expression and wild vague eyes, and he mentally said:</p> 
               <p>"Why should I heed her? She is evidently demented, and my wife and friend are, thank Heaven! too far above suspicion to be watched by me. I would sooner lose both than mistrust them."</p> 
               <p>In silence they walked forward, too deeply occupied with their own thoughts to take much heed of the wild scenery amid which their pathway lay. Marie said in her own heart:</p> 
               <p>"I will come back soon. I must watch over them, since he disdains to do so."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE AVENGERS OF BLOOD. TREACHERY.</head> 
               <p>DURING this interval, Evoli had nominally taken charge of Guilio's felucca, which although believed by the people of Isola Rossa to be engaged in the fishing trade was fitted up with a degree of luxury that was strangely at variance with the supposed calling of its master. The new commander left everything on board to the care of the mate, and only used the vessel as the means of making such excursions as he desired, and on his first trip, he landed at a<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6335-00000114"/> point on the coast from which he could easily reach Isola Rossa.</p> 
               <p>His excuse for going thither was to learn all that had taken place after the flight of Guilio, and the death of his rival. A terrible blood-vengeance he knew would be exacted for the deed, and deep in his heart lay the scarcely acknowledged thought that Guilio might easily be removed from his path if he chose to give the clue to his hiding place.</p> 
               <p>But this must not yet be done. He must have time to win his own way to the heart of the charming creature for whom he had conceived so sudden and violent a passion, to bask in her smiles day after day, in the security of the position he held as the friend of her husband, and under cover of that character, undermine the loyalty of Clarice to her wedded lord, while he filled her heart with discontent at the inferior lot awarded to one of such peerless endowments.</p> 
               <p>This done, the rest was easy of accomplishment, and the past experience of Evoli led him to believe that success was certain in the double treachery he meditated against the happiness and life of his chosen friend. He had received kindness and protection from the man he was about to wrong in this fearful manner, but every obligation of duty and honor fell before the wild passion that raged in his breast. He had loved before, or thought he had, but with nothing like the all-absorbing flame that sprang into existence as if by magic at the first glance from the dark, lustrous eyes of the beautiful Clarice.</p> 
               <p>The few days he had remained within the sphere of her enchantments had only deepened the charm, and Evoli fled from the presence of the wedded lovers, lest he should prematurely awaken the jealous fears of Guilio, and put the attached wife upon her guard against the wiles he so well knew how to use. Though, as we have already stated, he returned at intervals, remaining only long enough to make his absence regretted, and his reappearance looked forward to with pleasure. It is our purpose to follow him in the first of these excursions, as what occurred then is of importance to the development of our story.</p> 
               <p>Laying aside the striking costume he usually wore, Evoli assumed the garb of a working man, and landing a few miles from the town, walked towards it and entered its streets at an early hour of the morning. The house of the deceased Matra was opened for the performance of the funeral ceremonies, and thither he proceeded, guided by the people who were crowding toward it conversing on the exciting topic of the late murder.</p> 
               <p>The women of the town were gathering to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">audare alla gridata,</foreign> the outcry or howling usually held in Corsica over the body of a murdered man. This is made on the morning of the funeral, before the death-brothers come to remove the corpse for interment. Evoli passed the open portal, and looked with interest upon the lugubrious scene presented by the death chamber.</p> 
               <p>The corpse of Matra had been placed upon a tola or table, with a pillow beneath the head, on which a red Phrygian cap was drawn, its gay color contrasting strangely with the pallid and distorted face of its lifeless wearer, and a narrow strip of cloth was bound around the face to prevent the features from falling. The childless mother, with a stern, set face, sat at the head of the corpse, and in her iron mouth and darkly flashing eyes could be read a tale of purposed vengeance that might well cause the blood of a stranger to thrill and quiver with apprehension. A tiger crouching for a spring upon its prey, could not have shown more deadly fierceness in his glance than that which now blazed from those eyes of intense, rayless blackness; and her fingers worked convulsively, as if sharpening themselves for the death grip upon the destroyer of her son.</p> 
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6335-00000115"/> 
               <p>The leading improvisatrice of the town, a tall, dark-browed woman, led the mourners to the spot on which sat the bereaved mother. At their approach Dame Matra raised her head and looked sternly upon them, as they bowed solemnly and reverently before her. The mother returned their salaams with equal stateliness, and this ceremony was continued for about half a minute, when a cousin of the deceased invited the assemblage to mourn for the untimely death of their friend.</p> 
               <p>The guests arose with one accord, and formed a circle around the tola, singing, or rather howling, in a most lugubrious manner, while they swung around the bier, at intervals separating their joined hands, and again clasping them with the wildest demonstrations of grief.</p> 
               <p>Each performer in this weird scene seemed to act on and increase the dramatic vivacity of her neighbor, until their ecstacy was almost terrible to behold. The women loosened their long hair and suffered it to flow in dishevelled masses upon their shoulders; their eyes flashed with the fires of vengeance, their black mantles fluttering wildly as they madly whirled around, uttering wailing cries, striking the palms of their hands against each other, beating their breasts, rending their hair, and sobbing with emotion.</p> 
               <p>At the climax of the lamentation the mourners threw themselves upon the tola and scattered dust upon their heads after the manner of the ancient Hebrews. At length, exhausted by the violence of their action, the women threw themselves upon the floor, and sat motionless as the dead man over whom they poured their lament. Their wild wails died away in deep respirations, for the actors in the scene had exhausted themselves in the rapid evolutions they had made, and now sat with heads bowed upon their breasts in an attitude expressive of the deepest grief.</p> 
               <p>The stranger looked with a thrilling interest upon the fearful contrast offered by the wild death-dance, with its stunning howls and almost superhuman activity, and the grim, stark form which lay stretched before them in the immobility of death. As he looked critically at the mourning women, with their dishevelled locks, he likened them in his own mind to a company of Gorgons.</p> 
               <p>The stillness of death succeeded the wild uproar which had recently filled the apartment; the women sat motionless wrapped in their sombre mantles, with bowed heads, as if grief, exhausted by expression, had sunk into that torpor which ever follows excess. Evoli was beginning to weary of this silence, and wonder when it would end, when suddenly a young girl sprang from the circle of mourners, and commenced a wild recitative, in which she detailed the leading incidents of Matra's life. At the end of each strophe the wailing chorus of woe! woe! woe! was raised by the whole crowd, and prolonged into a cry of indescribable horror.</p> 
               <p>With passionate power, the improvisatrice described the love of the dead man for his perfidious bride; how he had stooped from a higher state to lift her to his side, and the reward he had met for his devotion. Every power was invoked to avenge the perfidy of which he had been the victim. The singer was a genuine poet, and truly the horrible and the beautiful have rarely been so blended as in that thrilling cry for the blood-vengeance upon him who had stolen Matra's bride, and given doom to himself.</p> 
               <p>The face of the girl glowed, her eyes flashed with the fires of vengeance, and as she swung around in her frantic dance, her long hair, which fell nearly to her feet, seemed like black snakes twining about her lithe form. At intervals the elder women joined in the chorus, with the force and vivacity of a company of veritable furies.</p> 
               <p>After the first thrilling effect of the scene passed away,<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6335-00000116"/> Evoli began to wish himself safe out of the crowd, which momentarily became more dense. He looked around to see if escape were possible; but when the interest of the spectator began to slacken, the tall form of the stricken mother arose.</p> 
               <p>She cast her hard eyes over the <unclear>assemblage</unclear>, and waving her hand for silence, took from her bosom a fragment torn from the bloody shirt of her murdered son. With a cry more like that of a wild animal, than the outburst of human anguish, she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Sons of Corsica! behold the life current of your brother, which stiffens this fragment of cloth! The blood you here behold lately flowed through the heart of my only child; it was poured forth by violence, and I demand Corsican justice against the murderer and all his race. I devote Guilio Falcone and his bride to the blood-vengeance, and I call on all those who claim kindred with me, to aid me in the accomplishment of this holy duty."</p> 
               <p>In answer to this demand, two tall, powerfully-made men, with hard and sinister faces, separated themselves from the throng, and placed themselves beside the bereaved mother. They simultaneously lifted their hands and responded, in deep stern tones:</p> 
               <p>"We reply to your call, mother of our kinsman. We dedicate our lives to the pursuit and immolation of Guilio Falcone and his stolen bride. Their blood shall atone for the crime which has been perpetrated. Hearken to our vow, childless mother, and be consoled."</p> 
               <p>Dame Matra laid her hands in theirs, and sternly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is well; you have vindicated your claim to belong to his race. My husband's nephews, I accept your pledge, and I shall look to you to redeem it to the letter."</p> 
               <p>"We swear to do so."</p> 
               <p>A murmur of applause greeted these words, and again a solemn silence fell upon the crowd. The mother sunk into her seat, and the two avengers stood scowling beside her.</p> 
               <p>Before this silence became too oppressive, a stir at the door announced the arrival of the death-brothers to remove the body to the church for interment. The lament was again raised, and continued while the priests slowly marched in, clothed in black, with their cowls drawn over their heads. They surrounded the bier, lifted the corpse from the table, and the crowd formed itself into a procession, while the whole company joined in the vocero which filled the air with its mournful melody.</p> 
               <p>With slow and measured steps they left the house, and proceeded toward the church, which had been prepared for the reception of the dead. Here the body was solemnly blessed before being taken to the burial ground, to the same weird national music which is so strangely calculated to arouse the deeper passions of the listener, while it conveys to the soul a message of doom and despair.</p> 
               <p>As Evoli listened to its stirring cadences, well aware as he was of the character of the deceased Matra, he could scarcely resist the feeling that his death merited atonement, and it was no crime in this wild people to take into their own hands the vendetta which is the only law to which they yield implicit obedience.</p> 
               <p>At the close of the ceremonies, the elder of the kinsmen who had pledged himself to accomplish the blood-vengeance, gave a pressing invitation to the crowd to return to Matra's house, to partake of a funeral banquet, which, it was whispered, was to be of unusual splendor. Cakes were distributed among the death-brothers, and the people, talking in suppressed tones, returned to the villa of the deceased.</p> 
               <p>During these ceremonies, Evoli was pondering in his own mind the course he should pursue. Was it yet advisable to open a communication with the avengers of blood? This<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6335-00000117"/> could be done at any moment when their assistance became important to him, then why act precipitately? Yet what had brought him to Isola Rossa but that very purpose, and why should he shrink from the initiative steps in the treachery which must be consummated before he could hope to gain possession of Clarice?</p> 
               <p>Yes-he would lose no time in the indulgence of scruples which must ultimately give way before the necessity of action. He would hold the threads of future events in his own hands, and guide them at his will, thus gaining the power to deliver up his rival whenever it became expedient to do so.</p> 
               <p>Stifling all sense of honor and faith beneath the insane passion that burned within him, Evoli curbed his impatience, and returned to the villa to partake of the death-feast.</p> 
               <p>Though the guests preserved the solemn gravity of demeanor appropriate to the occasion, their appetite did not seem to suffer from the indulgence of their sorrow, for more complete justice was never done to a lord mayor's banquet than to the luxurious viands and wines provided to console the friends of Matra for his untimely demise.</p> 
               <p>The two cousins especially regaled themselves, and the quantities they ate and drank were almost incredible. The impatient Italian watched them keenly, and he wondered if they would never be satiated; he finally resigned himself with the thought that all things must come to an end, even a death-banquet at the expense of the departed.</p> 
               <p>At length the company began to disperse; the wailing women, who had quaffed as much wine, and eaten as liberally as if grief had no part in the ceremonies of the day, took their departure with the others, leaving the childless mother to solitude and thoughts of vengeance. After bidding her adieu, the stalwart form of the elder Matra was seen to rise and advance toward the door. The Italian lost no time in following him, and when they gained a cross-street leading toward the sea, in which few people were seen, Evoli hurried forward, and addressed him in a friendly tone:</p> 
               <p>"A fair day, Senor, for so solemn a business as that to which we have just been attending. A terrible crime has been committed, and I, although no Corsican, can sympathize with the feeling that dictated your pledge of this morning to the bereaved mother."</p> 
               <p>Matra cast a sharp glance toward the speaker, and gruffly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Though no Corsican, an Italian knows the laws by which we are ruled: 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,' was the ancient code, but we simplify it, and say a life for a life. It is just: who shall gainsay our right to settle our own quarrels in our own manner?"</p> 
               <p>"Not I, for one, my friend; but in this case it seems to me you exceed your claim, for you propose to take two lives in payment for one. This is going beyond your own requisition."</p> 
               <p>"By no means, Senor. With us, where the outrage has been excessive, whole families have often been devoted to the Vendetta. This is a case of that kind. Falcone has no relatives that we are aware of, and the girl whose fatal beauty instigated the crime, must pay the penalty of her faithlessness with her life. If I find her, I shall have no mercy for her."</p> 
               <p>There was a fixed and stern resolution in the tones of the speaker, that made Evoli shiver. He, however, calmly said:</p> 
               <p>"But it is necessary, first, to find the criminals, and if I am rightly informed, they have escaped to the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">macchia.</foreign>"</p> 
               <p>"That is true enough, but patience, in the end, always<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6335-00000118"/> clutches its victim. Sleepless as jealousy-untiring as the sleuth-hound on the track of his prey-will I prove in this death-quest, for Guilio Falcone is the son of a man who once trampled on and insulted me, and therefore I am not likely to forego my promised vengeance."</p> 
               <p>"So-o, you have a double hate to satisfy," replied Evoli, slowly. "You are the man I seek, and I think we can come to terms with each other."</p> 
               <p>The person thus addressed paused and turned toward the speaker, that he might take a more careful survey of him. Though wearing the disguise of a peasant's dress, the handsome, resolute face and daring expression of Evoli revealed to the shrewd Matra that he was speaking with a person of no common stamp. His manner instantly changed from rude carelessness to one of respectful deference, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"You, too, are interested in this affair, Senor. Can we be of mutual assistance to each other?"</p> 
               <p>Evoli slightly flushed at the equality implied in this inquiry, and he hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it may prove so; but let us seek a more private spot in which to hold a conversation. I may render it to your interest to fulfill a part of the pledge given this morning, but it must be in my own time and on my own terms."</p> 
               <p>"The last will be liberal, Senor?"</p> 
               <p>Evoli nodded in reply, and Matra merely said:</p> 
               <p>"Follow me at a convenient distance."</p> 
               <p>He walked rapidly forward till he gained, the edge of the town, and then turned into a road bordered by trees, which led to a wine shop much frequented by the lower classes of the people. It was yet too early in the day for many guests to be assembled at this rendezvous, and when Matra asked for a private apartment in which to rest after the fatigues of the morning, the landlord showed him into an apartment partitioned off from the public room.</p> 
               <p>Beckoning to the stranger to join him, the two went in together, and closed the door. The curious landlord listened at the keyhole, to discover, if possible, the cause of this secret interview; but the guarded tones of the speakers completely baffled him, and he soon retired in disgust.</p> 
               <p>For more than an hour the two were closeted together, and when they were about to part, the bravo put a heavy purse into his pocket, as he respectfully said:</p> 
               <p>"I hold myself pledged to your service, Senor. At the moment you send the promised directions, I shall be ready to undertake the enterprise. After all, Falcone is the only criminal, and the girl may be permitted to escape."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Her life must be held sacred,</emph>" was the emphatic response. "For her sake I have interfered, and to purchase immunity for her, I betray her lover. I assure you that except through treachery it is impossible that you shall ever gain access to the retreat of Falcone. Only through me can you hope to come within striking distance of your enemy."</p> 
               <p>"I understand, Senor, and our compact shall be binding. The girl is safe, but how long must I wait before I have leave to clutch my quarry?"</p> 
               <p>"You must wait my pleasure, but you may be assured that it will be signified as soon as it is safe to do so, for I love the woman whose life I have bargained for."</p> 
               <p>"And she? Is she doubly treacherous?"</p> 
               <p>"No-she is now devoted to Falcone, but women do not always remain constant even to a chosen lover. When I appear before her as her saviour from a terrible fate, she will soon learn to love me in my turn."</p> 
               <p>"That will be a very natural result, Senor; I shall be careful to follow all your directions to the letter."</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6335-00000119"/> 
               <p>"It is well. Examine this ring, that you may recognize the validity of the message which accompanies it when I send it to you with such instructions as will enable you to carry out the enterprise."</p> 
               <p>He drew from his finger a cameo with a Satyr's head cut upon it, beneath which were his own initials. Matra held it in his clumsy fingers, and turned it in every possible light before returning the jewel to its owner. A crafty smile came upon his lips, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"I shall know the bauble again, and when it reaches me I shall act without delay. You may depend upon me, for the old dame gives the half of her son's estate to the kinsman who first succeeds in carrying out the laws of the Vendetta against his murderer."</p> 
               <p>"Adieu, then; within three months the reward shall be yours, together with a duplicate of the sum I have paid you this morning."</p> 
               <p>Matra rubbed his huge hands together, as he said:</p> 
               <p>"This has been a lucky day for me, for my fortune is as good as made. Many thanks, Senor, for your confidence in my discretion. You may be sure that I shall remember the Satyr's head, and look for its appearance with impatience."</p> 
               <p>"It will certainly reach your hands in the time specified, if I am still numbered among the living."</p> 
               <p>The two issued from the room, called for wine which Evoli liberally paid for, and then departed in different directions.</p>

               <head type="sub">A SERPENT ENTERS A FAIR EDEN.</head> 
               <p>BY this time the sun was sinking toward the west, and Evoli pursued his way toward the cove at which he had landed. The commander of the lugger had been ordered to hover in sight of the spot ready at any moment to obey his signal to take him on board, and in reply to a wave of his handkerchief, a boat at once put out from the vessel manned by two stout rowers.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments the Italian stood upon her deck, and received the cordial welcome of these rough men, for Evoli's unrivalled powers of fascination had enthralled even those rude sons of Neptune. He possessed the rare power of placing himself <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en rapport</foreign> with those with whom he has thrown, and the songs, stories and jests, with which he helped to beguile the tedium of a sailor's life, soon rendered him the idol of the crew. There was not a man among them who would have hesitated to imperil even his life for the pleasure of Senor Benedetto.</p> 
               <p>After a short and successful cruise the lugger again entered her usual harbor, and Evoli hastened to the cave to intoxicate himself more deeply with the charms of Clarice, and strengthen the purpose already fully formed, to tear her from the protecting arms of her husband. Yet his wonderful self-command enabled him to repress all outward sign of the passion which gained intensity with every passing hour. He did not speak of his visit to Isola Rossa, nor of the scenes there to which he had been a witness. Falcone must be well aware of the Vendetta which would surely be declared against him, and it was no part of his policy to betray his own interest in its fatal result.</p>

               <p>A few days sufficed to convince him that he could not live so near Clarice and see her lavish tender smiles and fond words upon her husband; the atmosphere of the cavern became stifling to his soul, and he again escaped from it to the open sea. After a brief cruise, he twice returned before the arrival of Barnardo was expected, but in these visits the eye of Marie Montoni was upon him, and in spite of his efforts to conceal what was passing within him, she dimly comprehended the threatened danger, though the two lovers were too much occupied with each other to suspect that the serpent had indeed entered their Eden.</p> 
               <p>Evoli wished to secure an interview with Barnardo before a meeting with Guilio took place, and for that purpose he again took temporary command of the lugger, and cruised between Corsica and the island of Monti Christo, keeping up a keen lookout for the Violante.</p> 
               <p>At length the white-winged felucca for which he had so impatiently watched made her appearance, bearing toward the coast of Niolo, and the lugger was steered at once toward the same point. She reached the cove first, and with a promise to report their progress to Guilio, Evoli resigned his command to the mate, and recommended him to proceed immediately upon his voyage. This was promptly done, and as the vessel moved out of the harbor, the Violante glided in, and dropped her anchor in the same spot she had just vacated.</p> 
               <p>As Barnardo stepped on shore, Evoli came forward to meet him, and a cordial greeting passed between them.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Guilio?" asked the captain. "I have been delayed on my voyage, and have so little time to remain that I hoped to find him here awaiting me."</p> 
               <p>Evoli shrugged his shoulders significantly as he replied with a laugh:</p> 
               <p>"What can you expect of a man so absurdly in love as poor Falcone? He forgets everything but the fair face of the girl he has brought to his mountain home."</p> 
               <p>"Yet it is to her I bring most important tidings, and I thought her husband would be most anxious to hear them. I must go on, I suppose, to the point at which I agreed to meet him, but as I am behind my time, I hoped Guilio's impatience would anticipate my arrival, and I should find him here."</p> 
               <p>"He will meet you at the spot agreed on, so we had better go on at once. We shall find mules awaiting us in the ravine behind the cliffs."</p> 
               <p>"Let us be off at once, then, for in two hours I must leave this landing. My vessel has been pursued, and I risked much to deliver my letters to Falcone and his bride."</p> 
               <p>While the two spoke they rapidly ascended the cliff, and on turning an abrupt angle found a shepherd holding a couple of mules by the bridle, ready caparisoned for the road. He touched his ragged cap and said to Evoli:</p> 
               <p>"You have come at last, Senor. This is the third day I have watched for you with the mules as you bade me."</p> 
               <p>"It is well-here is your reward," and he gave him a piece of money.</p> 
               <p>The two mounted and proceeded up the gorge in silence till they were beyond the hearing of the peasant. Barnardo then turned to his companion, and briefly asked:</p> 
               <p>"You were evidently watching for me, Senor. What is your purpose in seeking to gain this interview before I meet Falcone?"</p> 
               <p>"I merely wish to inform myself of the result of your mission, that I may bear it to Guilio in case he is prevented from meeting us."</p> 
               <p>"Has he then sent you hither as his ambassador?"</p> 
               <p>"By no means," responded the Italian, with some hauteur. "I am not at the beck and call of any man, not even of him who styles himself the King of the Mountain."</p> 
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6335-00000121"/> 
               <p>Barnardo bowed respectfully as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I am well aware that the Duke of Evoli was not born to obey the commands of one so far his inferior in rank as poor Falcone, though accident has thrown him on his hospitality."</p> 
               <p>The listener flushed deeply, and he rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"Ha! then I am known to you. How have you discovered my name and rank?"</p> 
               <p>"That was easy enough to a person of any acuteness. I suspected your position when you took refuge on my felucca. On my return to Italy, a few judicious inquiries revealed the fact that a political refugee of importance had evaded the sbirri. His name was readily learned, and I no longer doubted his identity with that of my passenger."</p> 
               <p>"And on your last visit to this spot you did not betray my secret. For that I owe you thanks, Captain Barnardo, and if, in all things else, you will be as true to me, I shall owe you something far more substantial which shall duly be paid."</p> 
               <p>"In what can I serve your excellency?" asked Barnardo, impressively. "I am a citizen of the world, battling my own way through it, and with such a patron as you can prove to me when once you are restored to your own, I should feel as if fortune has indeed smiled on me at last."</p> 
               <p>"And I shall be restored. The aspect of affairs in Italy is changing even now, and it will soon be safe for me to return there even before my sentence of exile is reversed."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so; but powerful friends are moving in your behalf, and doubtless before many months have passed, you will be permitted to return to your castle, and resume possession of your princely inheritance."</p> 
               <p>"Such is now my dearest hope. Political affairs may rest in oblivion forever, if I can only succeed in obtaining that on which my heart is now set."</p> 
                
               <p>"And that, I presume, is the love of a woman; for men do not usually relinquish the ambition of a life without some such delusive allurement. Better let the sex alone, my lord, and make fame your goddess. It is a safer pursuit, and does not end, as passion is apt to do, in satiety and disgust."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps I may find it to my interest to do so," coldly responded Evoli. "But what tidings have you brought the fair Clarice? Have you discovered her family as you pledged yourself to do?"</p> 
               <p>"It was a pledge easily kept on my part, for I already knew to what house she belongs. It matters not how I obtained my information, but I thought it best not to betray my knowledge to Guilio till I had communicated with his wife's father. I have done so, and I bear with me the result of my mission."</p> 
               <p>"And the girl?-who is she? what is she?"</p> 
               <p>"A far more fitting mate for yourself, my lord, than for him to whom fate has given her."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo's keen eyes were fixed penetratingly upon the face of the deeply interested listener, and the sudden flash of exultation that swept over Evoli's face revealed to him all he desired to know. He merely said:</p> 
               <p>"Then Clarice is of noble descent?"</p> 
               <p>"She is the daughter of Count Rinaldi Ernesti, and if her claim to her true rank is established, she comes in possession of a magnificent fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Can it be possible! And she, high-born, lovely as a dream, is thrown away upon a mountain brigand! What can be done to rescue her from such a fate?"</p> 
               <p>"It is the lot she has chosen," said Barnardo, drily. "I thought you were the fast friend of her husband, but you too seem ready to turn traitor toward this young couple. The father of Clarice refuses to acknowledge her unless she<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6335-00000122"/> gives up her husband. He will sacrifice the wealth bequeathed to her on certain conditions, sooner than receive the low-born Guilio as his son."</p> 
               <p>Evoli haughtily replied:</p> 
               <p>"And Count Ernesti only acts as a man of his caste should. But pray tell me all the particulars of this singular story, that I may understand the exact position of this young creature, who it seems must choose between love and fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Such is the inexorable necessity of her position; but I have one soft spot in my rough nature, and I am silly enough to hope that love may conquer, and her heart prove true to the allegiance it has plighted. I plead guilty to a feeling of strong sympathy for this attached young couple."</p> 
               <p>"Sympathy-yes, as long as their dream of happiness lasts it is well enough to encourage such feelings; but the reaction must come. Clarice is not formed for the wild and dreary life of an outlaw's wife. She will soon recoil from its monotony, and then the offer of her father will be all-powerful to lure her to his side. Will you reveal all the facts connected with this singular affair?"</p> 
               <p>"As much as it is necessary for you to know, I will reveal at once," and Barnardo briefly related the history of Ginevra's marriage, and her subsequent flight from the home of her husband, though he was careful to give no clue to its true cause. He lightly sketched the interview between himself and Count Ernesti, and when he ceased speaking, Evoli asked, with much interest:</p> 
               <p>"Do you consider the decision of the Count as final? Will his daughter find it impossible to move him from the determination he has expressed?"</p> 
               <p>"I am certain that he will prove as firm as iron on that point. His pride of family is such that no entreaties will induce him to receive the son of a Corsican bandit as the husband of his daughter. The pretty bride must choose between worldly grandeur and loyalty to her plighted lord."</p> 
               <p>"And who can doubt what her decision must eventually be? Clarice does not yet know herself; there are depths in her nature which have never been sounded, and when her ambition and love of luxury have been fairly brought into play, the decision must be against the humble lover who has given her his all. Yet all Falcone possesses, or ever hopes to win, are far inferior to what she has the right to claim. With such immense stakes in his favor, Count Ernesti must win the game."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo half sighed. As he had said of himself, he was not altogether evil, and in this game in which happiness and hope were the counters to be won or lost, he would have been glad if Guilio could have been the winner without any serious injury to himself. As it was, Evoli was too powerful a patron to be thwarted, and he saw plainly enough that his heart was set on effecting a separation between Clarice and her husband. As to his own share in the affair, he had warned the count of the results likely to ensue from his overweening pride; and, like Pilate of old, he washed his hands, and refused to bear the burden of the blood-guiltiness which might be incurred by others. He said:</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry that such a temptation has come to this poor girl. She will sacrifice her happiness, and gain no fair equivalent in return for it."</p> 
               <p>Evoli smiled significantly as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"Clarice is ambitious; she has an inborn love of the beautiful; she possesses refinement of taste, and an appreciation of luxury which will render her more liable to temptation than a person of a different organization. Besides, the imperious blood of the Ernesti will show itself, and the desire to regain her true rank in life will spring from the certainty that it is in her power to do so. Love will be<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6335-00000123"/> trampled under foot, as of little worth in comparison with the distinctions which will court her acceptance. Ah! you will see that I understand the riddle of this woman's nature."</p> 
               <p>"I could almost hope that your predictions may prove false, Senor; but end as this affair may, I have pledged my word to Count Ernesti to deliver a letter to his daughter, in which he sets forth the only terms on which she will be received by him. He allows her four months in which to make her decision, as the will of the uncle from whom she derives her fortune provides that she shall be reinstated in her rank, and the inheritance claimed within one year from the death of the testator. Several months have already been consumed in vainly seeking her, and when I arrived at his castle the count had almost given up the hope of reclaiming her in time."</p> 
               <p>"There are other heirs to contest the possession of this fortune, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Only one; a nephew of Vivaldi, who is an officer in the French service, and is now stationed at Bastia. Poor lad! it will be a sad disappointment to him, I fancy, when he hears that the heiress has been found."</p> 
               <p>"And what is the amount of the inheritance?"</p> 
               <p>"Five millions of scudi."</p> 
               <p>"So much! Then the affair is settled. No woman in her sane mind can hesitate in such a choice as this!" said Evoli, decisively.</p> 
               <p>"Yet I have an idea that this woman will do more even than that. If left to herself, Clarice will remain true to her husband; and she will soon even cease to regret the sacrifice she will be called on to make for the man of her choice."</p> 
               <p>"We shall see," replied the Italian, with a slight curl of his handsome lip. We are drawing near the point at which Guilio was to meet us, and before we join him I wish to arrange with you the means of communicating with my friends in Italy. I have with me a package I have prepared, and if you deliver it safely, I pledge myself to reward the service at some future day in a manner befitting the power and liberality of one born to my station."</p> 
               <p>"I can ask no stronger pledge from one of your name, my lord," replied Barnardo, deferentially. "Your commands shall be obeyed, and on my return hither I will bring with me such replies as will show you that your friends have not played the laggard in your service."</p> 
               <p>"It is well. Where shall we meet without the knowledge of Guilio? You know the entrance to the smuggler's cave, beneath the rocks a few miles south of the cove in which your felucca lies."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; for I have often concealed contraband articles there; but it is difficult of access, and is not often visited by us."</p> 
               <p>"Come to it again, and leave my letters for me, if I am not there to receive them myself. I will keep a look-out for your vessel, and if possible I will be on the spot when you reach it."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not forget, but if you can do so you had better meet me there. You know the avenue leading to it from the hills?"</p> 
               <p>Evoli nodded.</p> 
               <p>"And of late I have used it to good purpose. You are on this coast every month, I believe. Enable me to keep open the communication between us, and before the four months named by Count Ernesti have passed away, you will bear back his daughter to his protection. Her father will reward you nobly, and for myself, I pledge my honor that you shall name the payment due from me for such good service."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo reflected a few moments, and then said:</p> 
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6335-00000124"/> 
               <p>"If the young countess goes of her own free will to place herself under the protection of her father, I will undertake the service; but no force must be used."</p> 
               <p>Evoli proudly replied:</p> 
               <p>"You mistake me greatly, Barnardo, if you suppose I would resort to such means. If I cannot win the consent of Clarice to claim her birthright, she shall remain as she is for me. It is but fair to her, however, to place before her all the advantages she must sacrifice in relinquishing her rank, and I intend to be the friend who will show her what she will gain in claiming it."</p> 
               <p>"And you will win," involuntarily responded Barnardo, as he looked upon the handsome face and confident expression of the speaker.</p> 
               <p>"I believe so," was the tranquil response, and after a few more turns in the road, they reached the point at which they were to meet Guilio. He and Marie were there awaiting their arrival, and a cordial greeting passed between the four, in spite of the treachery which had just been agreed upon between Evoli and his companion. Guilio eagerly asked:</p> 
               <p>"What news have you, Barnardo? Do you bring anything satisfactory to me and my queen?"</p> 
               <p>"I am the bearer of all I undertook to bring; but it may not prove very satisfactory to you, my poor lad."</p> 
               <p>Guilio changed color as he held out his hand, which perceptibly trembled.</p> 
               <p>"Give me your letter," he faltered, "for I presume you have brought one. I will wait to see Clarice before I learn the facts you have gathered."</p> 
               <p>"It will be as well, perhaps. Here is the letter; it is important, I assure you, and reveals a very strange tale."</p> 
               <p>"It is one I wish could have remained untold," replied Guilio, with a constrained smile, "but since my wife is so deeply interested in it, I must hear it, I suppose."</p> 
                
               <p>He took the package which Barnardo offered, saw that it was secured with a heavy seal on which armorial bearings were impressed, and in spite of his efforts for self-control, he became deathly pale as he said:</p> 
               <p>"It is, then, as I feared; Clarice is the daughter of a noble house, and I-I-" his voice died away in a husky whisper, and Marie Montoni took his hand, and loftily said:</p> 
               <p>"And you are the chosen of her heart, Guilio. Bear up-have courage; respect yourself as a man, and all will be well."</p> 
               <p>Her words inspired him with new courage, and he recovered his outward composure. A few words sufficed to inform Barnardo of Marie's wish to be landed on the coast near Isola Rossa, and the smuggler at once took her under his protection. After arranging to return to the cove in three days for the answer of Clarice, the four parted, and as Marie gave her hand to Evoli, she impressively whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Be true to friendship and honor. Remember the warning of the sibyl that evil will come to you, greater evil to her you seek, if you follow the thought that is in your heart. I read and comprehend it, but if acted on, it will bring to you wo! wo! wo!"</p> 
               <p>She turned hurriedly away, and the Italian thought:</p> 
               <p>"Confound the woman! One would think that she is echoing the refrain of one of those terrible death-wails so popular in this blood-stained island. Idle words have never turned me from my purpose, nor shall they now."</p> 
               <p>"Shall we go on, Guilio?" he asked loudly, as he observed the absorbed air and motionless form of his friend, who was leaning against a tree, as if he felt the need of its support. He passed his hand vaguely over his brow, and muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Go on? of course-of course. The car of Fate rolls on forever, crushing everything in its way, then why should<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6335-00000125"/> we stand still upon the path appointed us? Tell me of your last cruise, Benedetto."</p> 
               <p>Evoli dismounted, and threw the bridle of his mule over his arm, and as they walked rapidly forward he gave his companion an amusing sketch of the life he had led upon the lugger. Guilio scarcely listened to him, though at intervals a hollow, forced laugh replied to his sallies-the package he carried in his breast seemed to burn into his very heart, but with singular reticence he did not ask if Barnardo had communicated to his friend the information he bore with him to Clarice.</p> 
               <p>Guilio was certain that Evoli was aware of the true station of his wife, yet he would not ask it, for he wished to put off till the last moment the knowledge of what he intuitively felt was to pain him so deeply, probably to prove fatal to the happiness which had become so precious to him. This feeling did not spring from a loss of confidence in Clarice, but his generous nature feared the magnitude of the sacrifice she was called on to make for his sake, and when it was completed, how should he ever be able to repay her for all she must surrender to share his isolated lot?</p> 
               <p>The conversation almost ceased before they reached the entrance to the cavern, for each one became too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts to give further expression to mere common-places. A warm greeting from the shepherd and his wife showed how glad they were to welcome the blithe-hearted Italian again, and it was with some effort that he at length escaped from them and entered the passage leading toward the apartments of Clarice.</p> 
               <p>As they passed through its dimly-lighted windings, Evoli repressed the tumultuous throbbings of his heart, and composed his mobile features for the approaching interview. He felt that he must betray none of the emotions that surged within him, for it was all-important that Clarice should not prematurely suspect the passion that thrilled in every nerve of his frame, and made him almost tremble at the thought of again standing in her presence.</p> 
               <p>He felt that there was a lack of delicacy in intruding himself upon the husband and wife at such a crisis, but he could not resist the power that impelled him to follow Guilio too closely to permit a word to pass between the two unheard by himself. He must be present when that revelation was made, and watch the flitting expressions of feeling which would sweep over the tell-tale face of Clarice, for she was transparent as a child, and too impulsive to conceal any emotion that strongly moved her. Yes-the tempter would read her heart at the moment this brilliant destiny was offered to her acceptance, and judge of his own chances of success to fulfill the pledge he had given Barnardo.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN IMPORTANT LETTER. HOW IT WAS RECEIVED.</head> 
               <p>AS Guilio and his companion approached the cavern, a strain of soft music echoed through the arches of the chapel, which came to these two enamoured hearts as a melody from heaven. Clarice was singing a hymn to the Virgin which Evoli had taught her during his last visit; she had no knowledge of music, and little skill in execution; but her natural taste was exquisite, and her sweet, girlish voice was full of tender pathos.</p> 
               <p>Tears sprang into the eyes of Guilio, although he was not one to yield often to the melting mood, but those of Evoli flashed with triumph as he thought:</p> 
               <p>"She sings <emph>my</emph> melodies in my absence, though she has also learned many from Marie."</p> 
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6335-00000126"/> 
               <p>The chapel was faintly lighted, and the curtains were closed over the interior apartment. As Guilio lifted them a flood of radiance flashed upon the two, and they beheld Clarice seated upon a large chair in the centre of the floor; with cushions piled upon it until it resembled a throne. She wore a becoming evening costume-a delicate rose-colored muslin fell in soft folds around her form, with a fall of fine lace upon the bosom and arms. The abundant hair was knotted gracefully upon her neck, and a crown of flowers, woven together with much skill, was placed upon her head. In her hand she carelessly held a sceptre also wreathed with flowers, and a smile of radiant triumph rested upon her lips.</p> 
               <p>The two stopped, spell-bound, and she gaily said:</p> 
               <p>"Approach, my lieges, and offer due homage to the Queen of the Mountain. Guilio, I greet you. Senor Benedetto, welcome again to our quiet retreat."</p> 
               <p>Guilio seemed at once to enter into the spirit of the scene. He sprang gaily forward, kneeled before the mimic royalty, and pressed his lips upon the hand she extended, while murmuring his rapture at the grace with which she maintained her assumed state.</p> 
               <p>Evoli also approached, bowed his stately head, and sinking on one knee, took in his own the hand which Guilio had relinquished. He lifted it to his lips, but he did not touch it with them, for he feared that his passionate caress might betray more than he cared to have suspected just now. As he arose he lifted one of her long curls to his lips, and breathing through its silken sheen a repressed sigh, said:</p> 
               <p>"To the queen of beauty I gladly offer the homage of a faithful subject. Claim me henceforth as your prime minister, or your slave. In either capacity I am ready to serve you."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my lord," she replied, with pretty coquetry. "I fairly warn you that I shall prove the most exacting and capricious of mistresses. To dedicate yourself to my service will be to possess no sinecure, I assure you."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better, fair lady. To serve you is the sincerest desire of my heart," replied Evoli, in a low voice.</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Senor; with two such faithful knights as you and Guilio, I am more fortunate than most queens, however genuine their claims to their rank may be."</p> 
               <p>This little scene struck Guilio painfully, and for the first time he contrasted the singular elegance of Evoli's person and bearing with his own. He knew that he was handsomer than most men, but he felt that when brought into comparison with the Apollo-like form of Evoli, he was but an ordinary-looking person. He recalled the words of Clarice concerning him, and the first pang of jealousy shot through his heart. In a tone so grave as to be almost stern, he said:</p> 
               <p>"You have then assumed this mimic state to receive the revelation I bring you. Ah! Clarice, was it well so soon to show me the wide distance between us?"</p> 
               <p>Clarice sprang from her throne, and casting her crown and sceptre at his feet, exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"My Guilio, how wilfully you misinterpret my intentions. I only meant to show you that, as your mountain queen, my station is loftier than any which fortune may offer to my acceptance."</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, my best beloved! my angel of sweetness and goodness! I am a wretch to doubt your devotion," and Guilio, penitent for the momentary suspicion, pressed his lips to the cheek now pale with emotion, and wet with tears.</p> 
               <p>"I forgive you," she faintly murmured, "and now tell me the result of your mission."</p> 
               <p>"Let me first place you on your throne, my queen, and<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6335-00000127"/> restore the baubles of your rank; then I will deliver the dispatches from our foreign correspondent, which, I am assured, are most important."</p> 
               <p>As he uttered these playful words, Clarice submitted to be placed amid a pile of cushions, on one of which her crown and sceptre were thrown beside her.</p> 
               <p>"Now I am quite ready to learn all that is to be told," she eagerly said. "Where are my letters, Guilio? We have wasted time enough in this mimic royalty, which after all you could not comprehend without an explanation. Where are my letters?"</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Your</emph> letters? True, they are yours, Clarice; then wherefore should I feel annoyed that you so imperiously claim them? Here they are."</p> 
               <p>He held the package toward her, with the seal turned down. Clarice scarcely glanced at it, as she said:</p> 
               <p>"You seem determined to misinterpret all I say and do to-day. Something strange has come over you since you left me this afternoon."</p> 
               <p>"Read your dispatches, and then, perhaps, you will see why I am in this state," replied Guilio, with emotion. He then more passionately went on: "Oh, Clarice, darling of my life, promise me--Yet, no,-I will owe all to your love, or lose all."</p> 
               <p>"Guilio, you <emph>cannot</emph> doubt me!" and her voice had in it a faint inflexion of irritation, that, after all, he could not implicitly trust to her honor, even if love had less to say on so momentous an occasion.</p> 
               <p>She cast her eyes upon the package which was addressed to "Guilio Falcone, to be delivered to her who was lately known as Clarice Marcante." She flushed deeply at this implied insult to Guilio; the writer would not even address her as his wife. When she turned it, and saw the immense seal with the crest of a noble family impressed upon it, she became very pale, but there was a gleam of proud triumph in her eyes, while she breathlessly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is this indeed from my father?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe it is. Open, and see what he says. This suspense is terrible to me; though, alas! I anticipate the contents of that letter, and dread the effect they may have on you."</p> 
               <p>She regarded him reproachfully while she broke the seal, but for the next ten minutes her face was worth studying even by one less interested in watching its varying changes, than were the two who lost not a shade that swept over it-each one desirous of putting an opposite construction upon her emotions.</p> 
               <p>A folded paper addressed to Clarice, Countess Ernesti, met her startled gaze, and she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Is it true? can this really be for me?"</p> 
               <p>"You were really born to that rank, and you may reclaim it if you see fit to do so," replied Evoli, with a smile. "Read, Senora, and learn on what terms your lordly father will restore you to your birthright."</p> 
               <p>"I shall also have terms to make," she said, with some hauteur. "My father has too long deserted me to have strong claims upon me now. My own heart shall be the arbiter of my destiny."</p> 
               <p>Her eyes sought those of Guilio, and a glance of tender mutual affection caused the heart of Evoli a sudden pang of doubt as to the result of all his machinations.</p> 
               <p>Clarice at length unclosed her letter, and with breathless interest, read the following lines:</p>

                           </opener> 
                           <p>"MY DAUGHTER:-At length I am permitted to address my long-lost child; lost to me through no lack of care on my part, for you were very dear to me in your infancy, in spite<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6335-00000128"/> of my disappointment that an heir had not been granted in place of a feeble girl. I recall you now, with baby curls upon your brow, and with the clearest, softest eyes; during many hours of my lonely life I have dreamed of that tiny image, and yearned to know what had been its fate, with a hungering of the heart for the love of my only child which at times was hard, hard to bear. Yet have I lived through it; but when you see me, you will behold in my saddened face, and prematurely whitened hair, evidences that I have suffered deeply and bitterly from the wretched events of my early life.</p> 
                           <p>"My daughter, you will naturally ask why you have been permitted to pass your childhood and early youth in the obscurity of a peasant's cottage, while your station was lofty, and your natural gifts such as might have filled a father's heart with pride. Blame me not for this, my child, for until very lately I knew not whither to turn to seek you. Your mother took pains to conceal you from me; but on my part, there has been no desire to disown the child who bears upon her breast the stamp of her race. The bloody cross is the heirloom of the Ernesti, and you are the last descendant of my ancient house. Thus you are doubly important to me as the child of my pride and my affections.</p> 
                           <p>"It is necessary to reveal to you enough of the past to enable you to understand the anomalous position in which you are placed.</p> 
                           <p>"Your mother was a daughter of the people; her family was respectable, but not noble. Her beauty was transcendent, and fatally enamored of that, I overlooked the fact that she was attached to one in her own sphere of life. At the bidding of pride and vanity, he was cast to the winds, for Ginevra Vivaldi could not resist the attraction of my fortune and title, and in an evil hour for us both, she gave me her hand.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"I soon saw that she was not happy. I fathomed the depths of her weak nature and found there the image of my rival, a man of peasant rank and little culture, for whom I had a sovereign contempt; yet this woman, who was dearer to my soul than all else in this breathing world, had endowed him with the royal gift of her affection.</p> 
                           <p>"I had madly hoped to win them from him; that my devotion must meet its fitting reward; but soon the wretched conviction was forced upon me that she barely endured my presence; that the luxury with which I surrounded her, was loathsome in her sight. For this she had sold herself, and now it became her bitterest punishment; for amid the leisure afforded her in my sumptuous home, she had time to dream and to regret.</p> 
                           <p>"I now know that I should have removed Ginevra to the city, and plunged with her into the excitements of social life; thus she would have learned to value the position I had given her, and have found other employment for her vacant hours than thinking of the lover she had relinquished.</p> 
                           <p>"I would have done this, but the education of my idol was defective, and my pride was such that I wished her to acquire certain accomplishments, usually considered indispensable to a lady before I introduced her to my friends. I wished her to become known to them with all the charms of a highly cultivated and beautiful woman; but, unfortunately, Ginevra possessed little natural taste for study, and I believe my efforts to improve only wearied her.</p> 
                           <p>"Whether the cause of our continued estrangement lay in myself, or in the tenacious hold her early attachment still maintained over her, I know not. I only know that the gulf between us widened, until even the birth of our child could not bridge it over. In the passionate outgushing of her heart over our babe, I saw that her nature was not cold.<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6335-00000129"/> Oh no! only to <emph>me</emph> was the fountain of her affections sealed.</p> 
                           <p>"Ah! it was gall and wormwood to me to behold her caressing thee, unconscious infant, while I stood by yearning, hungering for one such look, one such tone, as were so profusely lavished upon you.</p> 
                           <p>"My daughter, I cannot tell you all the depth of that dumb agony, for no soul can comprehend my suffering that has not felt it in all its bitterness. To say that I adored this woman would be to speak in tame and commonplace language of that to which no words may do justice. A fiery deluge of rage, passion and despair rolled over my soul in those hours of torture, but above it arose the certainty that she was the only Eve, and if not my twin soul, earth held no other I cared to win.</p> 
                           <p>"One year we lived together-a year, every hour of which bore with it some blissful hope or some blighting agony to my poor storm-tossed heart. Yes, I <emph>did</emph> try to win her love, how unsuccessfully you shall hear.</p> 
                           <p>"Your birth afforded me a faint hope of final success, to which I clung with the tenacity of despair, for I felt that this was my last chance to gain a place in the heart of my child's mother. But soon whispers came to me that Guiseppe, her former lover, had been seen haunting the grounds around my castle-that a woman, whose size was similar to that of the countess, had joined him, and walked with him through the vine-covered alleys upon the hill-side. I was warned to watch, and see for myself if this was my wife.</p> 
                           <p>"How I lived through the day on which this information came to me, I cannot now tell. It was one long dream of agony and suspense, but I would not accuse my wife till I felt assured of her perfidy. It was not my nature to act <unclear>on</unclear> bare suspicion; I must have proof of the wrong, and then the spring of the enraged tiger is not more deadly than would be my clutch upon the wretch that had injured me.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"I concealed myself near the door which led to the terraced walks, and watched for the appearance of the woman I had loved as man seldom loves-who had been honored as the wife of my bosom, going forth to meet one of whom now even to think with tenderness was a degradation and a crime.</p> 
                           <p>"Ginevra came slowly and wearily, not as one flying to meet the beloved of her heart, but as a victim going to the sacrifice. I stealthily followed her; I saw them meet-saw the accursed peasant clasp her to his breast, and press his polluting lips upon her brow. Then they walked beneath the shelter of the vines, and talked God knows of what! I did not know, nor did I care to learn. For me it was enough that my wife had so far violated her marriage vow as secretly to meet this man, and thus keep alive in her heart the passion that was destroying all hope of happiness in the union she had formed.</p> 
                           <p>"I did not betray my presence to them; till I had matured my plan of action, they should not know that I was aware of their perfidy. That Ginevra should be separated forever from her lover, I was resolute, and I took measures to secure his punishment as a bandit and a murderer, for since her marriage with me he had become both. Another meeting was arranged, of which I was duly warned by one I then believed my friend; this time the countess took her infant with her, to show the heiress of the Ernesti to her brigand lover. I suffered her to pass to the place of meeting, for my measures were too securely taken to apprehend defeat in the purpose before me.</p> 
                           <p>"Ginevra had scarcely joined Guiseppe when I sprang upon him, and with the assistance of my steward I mastered and bound him. I cannot dwell upon what followed; suffice it, <emph>the bandit was delivered over to justice, and met the punishment due to his crimes against the State.</emph>
                           </p> 
                           <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6335-00000130"/> 
                           <p>"Guiseppe was executed, and in the madness of that night on which his fate became known to the countess, she fled from my home, carrying our child with her.</p> 
                           <p>"Every effort was made to trace her. For years I did not cease to hope that she would yet return to me, but no sign came from her, and at last I resigned myself in dumb despair to the loss of that I had most valued on earth.</p> 
                           <p>"I did not give up all hope of tracing you, my child, for you at least I could call my own, and I possessed the right to claim you, even if Ginevra refused to return to the home of her wedded lord. But for seventeen long years all my efforts to recover you were baffled, and I lived a disappointed, embittered, unhappy recluse.</p> 
                           <p>"At last a ray of light dawned upon me. A clue to my child was gained, and my old age would not be left desolate. How joyfully I hailed that hope you cannot know, my Clarice, for you are young and untried in the sorrows of life. How sweetly it looms before me as I write, assuming a form of grace and beauty, with the pleading eyes and low-toned voice of her I loved so fondly, you cannot comprehend.</p> 
                           <p>"Oh, Clarice! if you disappoint me-if you refuse to come to me, I shall sink into the apathy of despair. But you will not-you dare not. After all I have suffered, this crowning disappointment will not be added to the bitterness of my wasted life.</p> 
                           <p>"A new impulse was given to my researches by the reception of important news from a brother of your mother. Tomaso Vivaldi had emigrated to the island of Barbadoes, where he accumulated a large fortune in trade. At his death this was devised to my daughter, provided she was acknowledged as Countess Ernesti within one year from the day of his decease. Enclosed with the copy of the will, which was forwarded to me, was an old letter from Ginevra to her brother. It was dated from Isola Rossa a few months after her flight, and was written from her death-bed.</p> 
                            
                           <p>"At her earnest entreaty Vivaldi had kept concealed from me the asylum of my daughter, but it seems that he caused an annuity to be paid anonymously to the woman who reared you, with the understanding that you were to have such advantages of education as the town afforded.</p> 
                           <p>"Vivaldi had loved his sister very tenderly, and in his will her daughter was named as his sole heir, provided I would also do my part, and acknowledge the child so long severed from me as the heiress of my name and honors. If this is not done before the expiration of the year, the estate falls to the heir-at-law, a nephew of his own name, to whose future he seemed indifferent, for he has left him only the petty sum of five thousand scudi out of an estate of five millions.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Clarice paused here, looked up from her letter, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Guilio! only think! I am actually the heiress to an estate of five millions! If I am to have all that money, I fancy I can do pretty much as I please. So, you see, you need not look so doleful because of my good fortune."</p> 
               <p>Guilio made an effort to smile, as he replied:</p> 
               <p>"I trust it may prove so, Clarice; but go on with your letter. Your face is like a mirror, for I can read in it every fluctuation of your feelings."</p> 
               <p>Before he had ceased speaking Clarice was again buried in her father's epistle; but soon the fair brow began to cloud, the red lips to compress themselves, and her cheeks to flame or grow pale, as conflicting emotions alternately assailed her.</p> 
               <p>The letter continued thus:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">

                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"And now, my daughter, comes the painful part of my communication. Reared as you have been, among people with whom <emph>my</emph> child should never have been thrown, your ideas are probably confused as to the relative positions<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6335-00000131"/> of the higher and lower orders of society. In fact, I have every reason to suppose them rather democratic; this is the inevitable result of your education, but it may be corrected in time.</p> 
                           <p>"With inexpressible regret I have learned that you evaded the unsuitable marriage arranged for you by your foster-mother, by eloping with a person entirely unfit to match with one of your high rank and brilliant fortune. I will say nothing disparaging of the young man to whom you have given your hand, for he is the son of a gallant and chivalrous chief, though, in fact, <emph>I</emph> can only regard him as a generous robber, who took from the rich to relieve the poor. No high-toned gentleman could live upon the contributions of others, whether they were given voluntarily or exacted at the point of the sword. I merely say this with reference to your deceased father-in-law, to show you how impossible it will be for me to receive his son as my own.</p> 
                           <p>"I wish to be explicit, Clarice, for I cannot bear contention, and if you elect to come to me it must be on my own terms. <emph>Only</emph> as the acknowledged heiress of my house can you claim any portion of the inheritance that has fallen to you, and I firmly refuse to claim you as my child unless you come to me freed from all ties, and ready to assume the brilliant position I offer you.</p> 
                           <p>"Your marriage at this crisis was a great misfortune to both of us, as it entails regrets upon you that might have been avoided, and gives me the trouble of applying to the Pope for a special decree annulling the ignoble alliance you formed while in ignorance of the high station to which you were born. But of the last I do not complain, and I shall immediately take steps to free you from the tie that binds you to Falcone.</p> 
                           <p>"Four months of the allotted year are yet unexpired, and by the time they have run their course I confidently anticipate cipate seeing you the ornament of my ancient halls, and the pride of my isolated heart. Thus you will have ample time to discover that all for love and the world well lost, is not a safe doctrine for those who are born to the brilliant prizes in the lottery of life.</p> 
                           <p>"Your fortune entitles you to match with the highest in the land, for even a prince might take to his heart the drughter of the Ernesti without feeling that he had made a misalliance.</p> 
                           <p>"It is not my wish to outrage your heart, my daughter, for at your impulsive age it is tender and truthful, but your dream of love can only be a dream at best, and the last dregs of its sweetness will have been exhausted before many months have passed away. Then be wise, Clarice, and accept the brilliant future I offer you. If Guilio Falcone really loves you, he will not stand as a shadow upon the path which, but for him, would be one of unclouded prosperity.</p> 
                           <p>"Write no appeals in his behalf to me. My nerves are too much shaken, and my mind too firmly made up on this subject to harken to them. You must come to me as <emph>my daughter,</emph> not as the wife of any man, or you must decide to forfeit both rank and fortune. The world shall never know that my child is found, if she is to become known to it as the bride of an outlaw.</p> 
                           <p>"You may think this hard and stern-perhaps it is, but I am what time and isolation have made me, and if you refuse your gentle ministrations to soften the nature which suffering has indurated, my heart may wither, and hope decay in the stern penance to which I shall devote the remainder of my days.</p> 
                           <p>"Captain Barnardo has pledged himself to deliver this, and bring me back your reply. Your first impulse will probably be to refuse every offer that does not include a recognition<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6335-00000132"/> tion of your husband's claims. I shall expect that, and therefore your first reply will not be considered final. That which reaches me four months hence I shall so regard, but in the meantime I shall go on in my arrangements for the future as regularly as if certain of finally reclaiming you on the terms proposed.</p> 
                           <p>"I will not permit myself to doubt this, for you are unlike your mother if you are destitute of vanity and love of splendor; unlike your father if you have no ambition lurking in the depths even of your feminine nature.</p> 
                           <p>"Adieu, my Clarice; write to me as to a friend who is deeply interested in your welfare, and do not hesitate to express your opinions even if they differ widely from my own, for I can recall my own youth, and make every allowance for your feelings. Remember one thing, though: that the love of no human creature is worth the sacrifice of a whole life, and the humiliation and extinction of a house which dates from the era of Rome's greatest power.</p>

               <p>Clarice looked up with flashing eyes and curling lip. Portions of the count's letter had deeply moved her, but its conclusion hardened her heart against this unknown father, and she clung more tenaciously to Guilio, because Count Ernesti appeared to consider it impossible that she should remain true to the vows she had plighted to him. She offered him the letter, and as he took it, she clasped his hand in both her own, and looking pleadingly in his face, said:</p> 
               <p>"It will wound you, Guilio, but my love shall heal the wound this hard old man inflicts. Read Count Ernesti's letter, then burn it, and forget that it has been written. I regret now that I cannot believe myself the daughter of Senora Marcante. Noble birth is of little value if it forces one into mean actions. I am required to make a decision in four months, but I make it now. I elect to remain with the husband of my choice, and all else may go. If Count Ernesti continues to refuse to receive you as his son, he must live without his daughter."</p> 
               <p>Guilio rapidly ran his eyes over the closely written pages, and Clarice, in her turn, watched the variations of his face; but it was better guarded, and did not reveal as much as hers had done to his scrutiny. But over that portion which referred to himself, his breath became short and his cheeks blanched, while his hand involuntarily grasped the paper with a clutch of iron.</p> 
               <p>At these indications Clarice drew near him, and leaning her head upon his shoulder, whispered.</p> 
               <p>"The scorn of the haughty father is more than balanced by the tender love of his daughter. Guilio, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mio,</foreign> look kindly upon me, or I shall believe that I have a share of your wrath against him."</p> 
               <p>"Never! oh, my angel, you can never think that. What Count Ernesti says of me is of trifling consequence, but the contempt with which he speaks of so noble a man as my father stirs all the evil that is within me. Theodore Falcone maintained the state of a free mountain chief with a degree of chivalrous honor that has never been surpassed, and here he is called a robber! Ah! it is very hard to bear."</p> 
               <p>"Then, do not think of it, my love. Let us burn the letter, and bury its contents in oblivion; they only bring heart-burning where happiness has erected her altar."</p> 
               <p>"No, Clarice," responded Guilio, sadly. "We must not destroy this letter, for its contents should be deeply pondered, and its offers weighed, before I can permit you to decline the advances of your father. You must sacrifice too<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6335-00000133"/> much for me to render my conscience easy if I accept your first impulsive offer to relinquish your splendid birthright for such a future as I can offer you."</p> 
               <p>Clarice started away from him, all the fire of her nature at once aroused.</p> 
               <p>"Then you are beginning to weary of me already. You wish me to accept the destiny that severs me from you! Truly, I shall not forget this."</p> 
               <p>Guilio seized her hand, but she withdrew it from him, and snatching up the crown and sceptre which had been twined for so different a purpose, she threw them upon the floor, and crushing them with her foot, said:</p> 
               <p>"Thus perish the symbols of the mimic royalty which I would have preferred to any state unshared by you. But you do not choose that I shall have that privilege; you assume to be my lord and master, and <emph>you</emph> issue the decree that separates us. Remember throughout all your future, that <emph>you</emph> refused the sacrifice I offered you. Wealth, position, all sunk into insignificance in comparison with the love I have felt for you, but you must consider my <emph>interests,</emph> forsooth! Ah, well, senor, in what can I aid you after I am restored to my birthright, or have you no ulterior ambition to serve? Or am I cast off simply because you are tired of me?"</p> 
               <p>This torrent of passionate words was poured forth so rapidly that Guilio could not find breath to interrupt her. He had always known that Clarice was quick-tempered, but he had never expected such a flash as this from lips that had hitherto only breathed love and sweetness. But he saw that she misunderstood him, that she was wounded to the soul, and he forgave her. He earnestly said:</p> 
               <p>"You cannot seriously doubt my love for you, Clarice, nor can you believe that a few brief weeks of perfect happiness can have rendered me indifferent to her who bestowed it upon me. I consider you as pledged to remain with me under any and every circumstance that may arise, nor will I waive one tittle of my just claims as your husband, at the bidding of the greatest noble in the land. <emph>You are mine,</emph> and while life lasts <emph>mine</emph> you shall remain. I refuse to burn this letter, merely because I wish to keep it as a reference for facts that may be imperfectly remembered. I cannot bear to strip you of both rank and fortune, and perhaps a way may be found to preserve the latter, or at least as much of it as may be necessary to us. Count Ernesti refuses to acknowledge you unless you relinquish your allegiance to me, but we can offer to share your uncle's fortune with the lawful heir, and unless he is a miser, he will not refuse such a compromise. See, love, I do not consent to part from my precious pearl, only to save it for a fitting setting."</p> 
               <p>Truth and love beamed from his dark eyes, and Clarice subdued, ashamed of her sudden burst of passion, placed both her hands in his as she penitently murmured:</p> 
               <p>"Forgive me, Guilio. You love me, then, as your soul, as your life, and I-"</p> 
               <p>Overcome by her emotion, she bowed her head upon his breast, and burst in tears. Guilio soothed her, and spoke such tender words as reassured her momentary doubt, while Evoli looked on with anger filling his heart, though a cool, sarcastic smile flitted over his handsome mouth.</p> 
               <p>"Give me but three months in which to work my spells, and then we shall see how much all these professions are worth," was his thought, but he spoke very differently.</p> 
               <p>"Dear friends, permit me to congratulate you on issuing from this trial as gold from the refiner's fire. Such love is so rare on this planet, that Fate itself should smile upon its continuance."</p> 
               <p>Clarice lifted her tearful face and smiled upon him as she held out her hand.</p> 
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6335-00000134"/> 
               <p>"Senor, you have witnessed our first quarrel and its reconciliation. Pardon us that we were so absorbed in our own feelings as to forget the presence of a third person."</p> 
               <p>Evoli took the proffered hand, pressed it respectfully to his lips, and replied with an air of chivalrous deference with which she was struck even at that moment.</p> 
               <p>"Senora, I am glad that I came hither at this time, for the scene I have witnessed proves to me that in one woman's form, at least, dwells the spirit of an angel. My friend Guilio is indeed a king, and his empire is that of a noble and true heart. Your disinterestedness, your noble self-sacrifice, must be appreciated by him at their full value."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Guilio, proudly. "My Clarice has the ring of the true metal, and I own that I doubly prize her since she has proved that love and true faith are of more worth than worldly distinctions. Now let us soberly sit down and discuss the count's letter, and the necessity of action on our part which arises from it."</p> 
               <p>He again placed Clarice upon her cushions, and throwing himself beside her, motioned to Evoli to occupy a divan in front of them.</p> 
               <p>"Benedetto, we elect you our counsellor. You have seen more of the world than I have, and you can probably afford me such assistance in this matter as will be useful."</p> 
               <p>"Speak your wishes, Guilio, and be assured that I am entirely at your command."</p> 
               <p>"Barnardo has doubtless informed you of all the facts concerning this inheritance, which has at last reminded Count Ernesti that he had a daughter. Is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>"He did; but what can I tell you that the count's letter has not revealed?"</p> 
               <p>"He alludes to the nephew of Tomaso Vivaldi, but affords no clue to where he is to be found. Who is he, and where shall I seek him? Can you tell me that?"</p> 
                
               <p>"I believe I can. Lieutenant Vivaldi is at this time stationed at Bastia, and a letter addressed to him there will safely reach him. I think it very probable that he will grasp at the hope of a compromise."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will write immediately, and find a sure messenger to bear my proposal to him."</p> 
               <p>"That will be well. Confide your letter to me, and I will send it by one whose fidelity I have before tested," replied Evoli, with tranquil assurance, for he felt that the trustful nature of Guilio, and his entire confidence in himself, placed his fate completely at his mercy.</p> 
               <p>The offer was gratefully accepted, and Evoli soon after departed under the pretext of sending for the person he wished to employ as a messenger; but in truth, he could no longer remain in the presence of Clarice, and with unmoved features see her tender eyes seeking those of Guilio, as if deprecating all memory of the storm which had lately swept over them.</p> 
               <p>For the present, he felt that the bond which united them had gained additional strength, yet he believed that, with time and opportunity, he would surely sever it. So long as Clarice clung to her husband, he would not complete the measure of his intended treachery: at the moment she wavered in her allegiance to him, she herself would strike the death-knell of Guilio. At the first indication of a preference for himself, the fate of his rival would be sealed; Guilio could not be permitted to live, for the terrible strength of passion breathed into his tones and gestures when he claimed his wife as his own forever, showed Evoli that his own safety could only be secured by the sacrifice of his former friend.</p> 
               <p>In his career, Evoli had broken hearts, and trampled on tender ties, but hitherto his hand had been unstained by blood, and his soul free from such treachery as bans a man<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6335-00000135"/> even in the unscrupulous world to which he belonged. It would be wronging him to say that he did not shrink a little from the part he had undertaken to play, and at moments he was ready to fly from the deadly temptation, and permit these attached lovers to live alone for each other.</p> 
               <p>Then the enchanting form and face of Clarice would arise before him, and his blood thrilled with the violence of the passion she had inspired. No-he could not relinquish her. She must-she <emph>should</emph> be his. Such was his final determination, and his mind once made up, no marble could be harder, no iron more inflexible.</p> 
               <p>He muttered as he rode along:</p> 
               <p>"It was a shrewd thought of Guilio's to seek out the heir and divide the inheritance, but I will baffle him there, as I will at every point. He is no match for me in subtlety or power, and Clarice shall yet be mine. I love her madly, and her hand will bring me the wealth I sadly need to fill my coffers.</p> 
               <p>"Why should I hesitate? Fool! cast doubt to the winds, and grasp fortune at its culminating point. What if one I once called friend, is crushed by my triumphant chariot wheels? Is it not the history of life? One man sinks upon the road, and is trampled in the mire, while another rises upon his ruin."</p> 
               <p>Thus Evoli endeavored to stifle the last remains of principle and remorse, yet he felt that the enormity of the crime he meditated against the man who had sheltered him, who had confided in his friendship, could not be palliated by the utmost sophistry of a nature skilled to deceive itself where self-interest was the impelling motive.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A FALSE FRIEND TRUSTED.</head> 
               <p>LEFT to themselves, Guilio and Clarice renewed their tender protestations of eternal fidelity, and both believed that nothing could ever again shake their confidence in each other. At length, Clarice said:</p> 
               <p>"Let us write our letters without delay; I do not wish to defer mine, though I have not much to say to Count Ernesti in reply to his long epistle."</p> 
               <p>"You remind me of my own duty, for I must write at once to Vivaldi; but there is no need to hurry about yours. Barnardo will not return for your reply under three days, so you had as well take time to think it over a little."</p> 
               <p>"No-as I said before, not a day, not an hour, will I reflect on my decision. I will write at once, and tell my lordly and indifferent father that I refuse his name and station on the degrading terms offered me. That I will cling to my husband through good and evil, and glory in sharing the fortunes of my Mountain King."</p> 
               <p>Guilio was enchanted with her spirit, as much as with her devotion to himself. He replied:</p> 
               <p>"Do so then, my darling; and be sure of one thing-that you have this day, by your noble renunciation of fortune and station, for my sake, bound me to you with bonds of iron strength. Now, I defy any one to separate us. Write your letter while this fervor of feeling lasts, and Count Ernesti will comprehend that a tender woman's heart is stronger than his pride, more immovable than the granite hills she chooses as her home, in preference to his stately halls. My Clarice, my heart exults in your devotion, and I accept the sacrifice you make, with the certainty that it will never be regretted by your generous nature."</p> 
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6335-00000136"/> 
               <p>"I can never regret what gives me entirely to you, Guilio;" and both expressed the faith that was in them.</p> 
               <p>Guilio brought out writing materials, and set himself to the unusual and rather difficult task of composing a letter to Francesco Vivaldi, for he was not much in the habit of writing to any one.</p> 
               <p>Clarice, with the facility of her sex, soon accomplished her task, and brought the result of her labor to be read by her husband, who ran over the following lines:</p> 
               <q>
                  <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> 
                     <body > 
                        <div type="letter"> 
                           <p>"MY LORD AND FATHER-I have read your long letter with intense interest, and I will own to you that portions of it moved me very deeply. I mourned for your sorrows, and for a few brief moments indulged the hope that I might be permitted to bring back joy to your desolate life. But as I read on this hope was cruelly dashed, for you coldly set before me the <emph>only</emph> terms on which I may be received in my ancestral home.</p> 
                           <p>"Those terms, my lord, are harsh, hard, impossible to be complied with. Yes, my father, <emph>impossible,</emph> for my heart and hand are equally pledged in the contract into which I have entered. It is not my purpose to break it, for I love Guilio Falcone with all my heart-I respect the memory of the father of whom you have so contemptuously spoken, and I see no disgrace in the manner of his life. Theodore Falcone fled from persecution, and assumed the state of a feudal chieftain over <emph>willing</emph> vassals. If his course was disgraceful, so also was that of the warlike barons from whom I learn that I am descended.</p> 
                           <p>"Of my husband I will only say that I love him, and he loves me, as you once loved your adored Ginevra. Knowing this, ask yourself if we are likely to give each other up at the bidding of caste and cupidity?</p> 
                           <p>"No, my lord; keep your name and fortune, if for them I must pay the price of a broken heart and a dishonored marriage vow. Forget that your long-lost child yet lives, since she is forever dead to you unless you accept as your son the man to whom she has pledged her life, her love, all that is dear to the heart of woman.</p>

               </q> 
               <p>Guilio was charmed with this reply. He thought it could not be amended, and Clarice, elated by his approbation, sealed and directed it at once.</p> 
               <p>Guilio still continued to ponder over his task; excitement had wearied Clarice, and she buried herself in her cushions to review the incidents of the day, and reconcile herself to the dissolution of the airy fabrics she had unconsciously been erecting during the past few weeks of her life. They had fallen in glittering ruins around her, and the first crash had been so stunning that she had no power to realize its effects. Obedient to her first generous impulse, she had felt all she spoke to Guilio, but now the reaction came, and regrets bitter, though unexpressed, filled her heart as she thought that with noble birth, wealth within her grasp, she must yet be doomed to live in her mountain eyrie, because a stern, proud father held her fate in his hand, and refused to yield her birthright except at the sacrifice of her husband.</p> 
               <p>She felt that Guilio was most dear to her, but her evil angel would whisper that she had indeed paid dearly for him; the devotion of his whole life could scarcely repay her for the immense sacrifice she had made; and the imperious nature which was veiled beneath the charming grace of a beautiful and idolized woman, began to assert itself into a power most potent for influence upon her future life.</p> 
               <p>The world she had renounced arose before her in all its brilliant attractiveness to the young and untried; in the halls of fashion and pride she might reign a queen indeed,<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6335-00000137"/> lapped in luxury, lulled to forgetfulness of the past by the syren voice of flattery. All that civilization has garnered of intellectual and artistic wealth was opened for her; things which the native refinement of her soul rendered dear and precious to her, in spite of her imperfect culture, might be hers but for the tie that bound her to Guilio. Ah! why did her father not find and claim her before she became his wife? but having now mingled her fate with his, it was too late to retract. Every feeling of honor, as well as every impulse of affection, bound her to his side for ever. She must content herself with the future she had voluntarily embraced, and she would do so; but her heart sank at the prospect of life passed in those caverns, cut off from social intercourse, her sole intimate companion a man who could not elevate her above her present standard; for Clarice felt that much as Guilio loved her, he was not her superior either in manners or acquirements, and the great need of her life was to advance. She stood upon the threshold of fate, full of noble and true aspirations, gifted with that power which in perfect development is called genius-with an intense longing for the purest and most refined enjoyments of life, yet when the door of the fairy temple was unclosed far enough to permit one tantalizing glimpse within, it was suddenly closed by her own hand.</p> 
               <p>Oh! hard fate! thus to be compelled to renounce what was so necessary to her future well-being, and bitter was her resentment toward her relentless father for forcing this choice upon her. A few burning tears were shed, but when Guilio arose, and put aside his writing as if to rejoin her, she stealthily wiped them away, and throwing her arm over her face pretended to be sleeping calmly.</p> 
               <p>"Poor child," he murmured, as he knelt beside her, "she is exhausted by the violence of her emotions, and like a tired infant has fallen asleep. Oh, Holy Mary, who has given to my keeping this thy fairest daughter, enable me to be all in all to her. Let her not regret the worldly distinctions she has renounced for my sake; she gives up much, oh, holy Mother of God, and I pray thee to grant me the power to repay her by such loving care as will render her happy."</p> 
               <p>Clarice heard this simple, heart-felt prayer, and was deeply touched by it, but she did not cast herself upon his bosom, and tell him how much she was moved. Two natures seemed to be warring within her; the better one bound her to Guilio; the baser one pointed to the brilliant future which might be hers if she could bring herself to repudiate the tie that bound her to him. She shuddered as the temptation assailed her, and put it aside, but the evil thought had found a place in her heart, into which it would surely again intrude.</p> 
               <p>Evoli returned in time for their usual supper of <foreign xml:lang="ITA">broccio</foreign> and cream. He seemed in high spirits, and presently said:</p> 
               <p>"A bright thought has struck me, Guilio. I found Bandolo, the messenger of whom I spoke, ill in bed, and as he cannot leave home for several days, I have concluded to save you the annoyance of waiting so long, by going to Bastia myself. I have a friend there who will receive and conceal me, and under the disguise I shall assume I can communicate with Lieutenant Vivaldi with perfect ease."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, my dear Bendetto," replied Guilio, with animation. "This kindness is so like your unselfish care for others; but are you sure that you are not going on this journey solely on my account?"</p> 
               <p>"By no means; for I assure you that I have business in Bastia that is important to myself. Senor Baliera, the banker there, is my agent, and an old friend besides."</p> 
               <p>Guilio laughed frankly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes-I comprehend the pressing nature of the business,<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6335-00000138"/> and the sudden desire to visit your friend; but I will not refuse your offer, Benedetto, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mio;</foreign> you wish to serve me, and I will not disappoint you, for you are the best agent in this affair that I could employ. Clarice and I give you <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> to make terms with Vivaldi."</p> 
               <p>"I think I shall succeed in my object," replied Evoli, evasively. "At least zealous efforts on my part will not be wanting," and the last scruple of conscience vanished as Clarice sprang from her seat, and grasping his hand in both her own, said, with the impulsive grace of her nature:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Senor, you are our good angel! In every emergency, you have proved yourself the best and truest of friends. If we had only known this a few hours earlier, Marie could have been the bearer of Guilio's letter, for she has also gone to Bastia; or you could have accompanied her."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it is well as it is," replied Evoli, quietly. "I can enter the town alone without observation, but the escort of a person so well known as Marie Montoni might have to account for himself to the authorities."</p> 
               <p>"True-I had forgotten that you are an outlaw, though one not subject, thank Heaven, to the Vendetta. Oh, Senor, when I think of all that happened on my bridal day, I thrill and quiver with fear for Guilio's safety."</p> 
               <p>"And for his alone? Are you not equally in danger, Senora?"</p> 
               <p>"I did not think of myself, for when death reaches him I shall share it. Our fates are one."</p> 
               <p>"Count on more than one defender, Senora. Side by side with Guilio, would I protect you with my life. But let us not speak on this sad subject; rather let us discuss the brilliant prospects that open before you, and the use Guilio may make of the fortune I go to secure for him, in placing you both beyond the reach of Matra's family."</p> 
                
               <p>"Can that really be done?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing is impossible to will and money. With the half of your uncle's fortune, added to what Guilio himself possesses, you will be rich. He can change his name, emigrate to France, and either in Paris, or in the country, lead such a life as will be suited to your tastes."</p> 
               <p>Clarice listened in an ecstacy of delight.</p> 
               <p>"That is charming! We will live in Paris, by all means; and I will study music, drawing, languages, and all other accomplishments in which I so ardently desire to excel. We will also have a chateau for the summer, and Guilio can keep a yacht, in which to make excursions to this spot at least once a year. Oh, yes-I have been so happy here, that I must always love it best of any place on earth."</p> 
               <p>A faint cloud passed over Evoli's face, but he replied, with a smile:</p> 
               <p>"You have the aspirations of a princess, Senora. The half of your fortune, if saved to you, will scarcely enable you to keep up two establishments in France; as expensive a toy as a yacht, and a third home among these hills. To possess all the grandeur your tastes covet, you must reconsider your father's offers."</p> 
               <p>"That I will never do," replied Clarice, with an expression of hauteur. "I am only surprised that you should refer to them, after what you witnessed here to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, Senora, I spoke without thought. Behold in me not only the humblest of your servants, but the most devoted of friends."</p> 
               <p>"We comprehend that, Benedetto," said Guilio, a little curtly, for he began to think his comrade rather too profuse of offers of service to his bride. Evoli read the feeling, and instantly checked himself. He turned calmly toward the speaker and asked minute directions for the successful transaction of the important mission he was about to undertake.</p> 
               <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6335-00000139"/> 
               <p>Guilio confided to him the letter he had written, and also gave him such credentials as would prove beyond a doubt that Evoli was the agent appointed by himself to arrange this business. Clarice wrote a few hurried lines to Marie, begging her to return as soon as possible, as she already found the cavern lonely without her, and she dreaded to look forward to the days when Guilio must leave her alone in these vast echoing chambers, to assume the command of his lugger.</p> 
               <p>These things settled, Evoli laid aside all business cares, and played the part of the cultivated and elegant gentleman. His varied information, fine colloquial powers, and light gaiety combined, formed a manner unrivalled for its fascination; and both his companions were equally charmed with him. At Guilio's solicitation he sang, and his fine voice floated away among the caverned halls, and came back in broken echoes of sweetness, as if the imprisoned spirits of the air had suddenly been aroused from their silence to answer each other in snatches of melody.</p> 
               <p>At length he arose to take his leave, saying that he should depart at early dawn, and within a week he hoped to return with a good report of his success. Wishing him God speed upon his journey, the lovers parted from him with perfect confidence in his good faith, and Clarice resolved to content herself as well as possible in the interval; for the lure held out to her by the wily schemer, of a residence in Paris, had operated as he had hoped, and intended it should. This evanescent hope quenched, a vague discontent must arise in her mind, and then his spells must, in time, work their fulfilment. The web he was slowly but surely weaving around her, should bind, at first, by threads of gossamer, but in the end prove fetters of steel, from which she could no more escape than can the bird once lured from the greenwood bough to shelter itself in the cage prepared for it.</p> 
                
               <p>As Evoli went forth he stopped in the upper cave, where he found the wife of the herdsman awaiting him. A smouldering fire burned in the circle of stones appropriated to it, and a feeble lamp, whose light only served to render the vast extent and dreariness of the place more visible, flickered near her. Evoli approached quite close to her before the woman was aware of his presence; Lisa sat with her hands strongly clenched together, and in the eyes that were bent upon the dying fire, burned a spirit as fierce and quenchless as the element on which she gazed, when it is unchained and sweeping onward in its might. He paused and keenly surveyed her, and the feelings that were surging through her heart were as legible to him as the page of an open book, and he smiled with triumph as he read them. When he at last spoke, Lisa started and turned toward him with the fierce gesture of a tiger suddenly aroused from slumber.</p> 
               <p>"So, Lisa, you did not fail me. I thank you for your punctuality."</p> 
               <p>"And well you may, Senor," she gloomily replied, "for I had a world of trouble to get away from Angelo and the child. My husband is sleeping now, but if he should awake and find me gone, I should find it hard to account for coming back to this place at so unusual an hour."</p> 
               <p>"Tush! tell him that the goats were fighting, or something had not been attended to. You're no true woman if you cannot find an excuse that will satisfy a good-natured dullard like Angelo."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps I might," said Lisa, with sombre contempt, "for he is good, and has faith in me, although I am plotting to deceive him. But dull as he is, Senor, if he fathomed our plans, he would kill us both."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is supposing an extreme case. He will <emph>not</emph> fathom <emph>my</emph> designs, nor yet will he have the chance to destroy either of us. I will make your fortune, and his too, if you<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6335-00000140"/> will only serve me faithfully. You have thought on all I said to you, and you agree to aid me so far as lies in your power?"</p> 
               <p>For a few moments the woman seemed buried in a gloomy reverie, she at length said:</p> 
               <p>"I know that I risk everything to obey you, but the temptation is irresistible. I am weary of this hard life. I wish to escape from it, and I see no justice in the fate which makes me a slave, and <emph>her</emph> a dainty creature to be served and waited on as if she were indeed a princess. I believe I almost hate her."</p> 
               <p>She pointed in the direction of the interior cavern, and a thrill of apprehension shot through the heart of the listener as he saw the baleful fire in her deep black eyes, but he lightly said:</p> 
               <p>"This is nonsense, Lisa. What has Guilio's bride done to arouse such bitter feeling on your part?"</p> 
               <p>"What has she done?" repeated the woman, in a tone of intense bitterness. "She has stepped between me and my foster-child; she has made him regardless of everything but her caprices, her comfort. She has rivalled my daughter, who is still in her convent completing the education which I fondly hoped would make her his equal and his wife. See-is not this enough to make me hate her? Then she treats me as a menial-she talks only with the half crazy woman that went away to-day, and thinks I am well repaid for all my services by a few words of thanks."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well-things will mend now. Marie is gone, and your turn has come. You will be with her more, and you will begin to understand each other better."</p> 
               <p>"I understand her well enough already. She is a vain little butterfly, with no thought but for her own fantasies, no fitness for the wild life she has adopted. How long do you think she will be contented to live in that place you fitted up like a palace, and deck herself in the finery you placed there for her use?"</p> 
               <p>"Not very long, I trust, and in that lies your hope, too. Listen, Lisa, and with your usual intelligence comprehend how necessary we are to each other in this business. When Clarice wearies of her mountain life, I will, with your assistance, bear her far away from this spot, and your daughter can assume the place she now holds."</p> 
               <p>A flash of exultation shone in the eyes that were turned upon him; she said:</p> 
               <p>"You, Senor? She loves Guilio, then how can that be accomplished?"</p> 
               <p>"Leave that to me. I will answer for the end, if you will aid me in the beginning."</p> 
               <p>"And Guilio? Will he be unharmed? Will you answer for his safety?"</p> 
               <p>"He shall be well cared for; have no fears for him," replied Evoli, with apparent frankness. Guilio is my friend; he has sheltered and befriended me; therefore he is only to be released from his wife when she ceases to regard him as the dearest of creatures. Indifference always follows passion, and the love on which such large drafts are made will quickly exhaust itself. Clarice shall reign in my palace, while the fair Gulietta assumes her place here in the heart and home of the mountain chieftain."</p> 
               <p>"In your palace, Senor? Then my suspicions are true, and you are a man of rank?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, yes-I spoke thoughtlessly, but I confess that I am of a higher station than you probably suppose. To men like me, no barrier is too high to be overleaped. To will and to do, to wish and to possess, is our birthright; so now are you ready to serve me?"</p> 
               <p>"At any and all times," was the prompt reply, and Lisa held out her hardened, toil-worn hand to seal the<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6335-00000141"/> compact. Evoli took it in his slender white one, and held it firmly as he said:</p> 
               <p>"Then when my myrmidons come to seize upon <emph>my</emph> prize, and bear her away, you will give no alarm. You will place over the entrance of the concealed passage a mark which will point out to them the exact spot, that not a moment of precious time may be lost."</p> 
               <p>"But if the sbirri discover the entrance, we shall never be safe again," she cried.</p> 
               <p>"Tush! I shall not send the sbirri on this errand. The men who come hither will be friends of my own, who will return with me to Italy. Your seclusion will be safe as ever for they will be sworn to secrecy."</p> 
               <p>After a pause, Lisa slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"In that case, I may safely promise. Yes, if you will take far from me the fair face that has bewitched my Guilio, I will do as you wish."</p> 
               <p>"Then it is understood, but you must breathe no hint to Angelo."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, he would destroy me if he only suspected me of such treachery! I dare not let him know, and even now I risk much in staying here so long. Hark! what sound was that?"</p> 
               <p>They listened an instant, and Evoli said:</p> 
               <p>"It is nothing; but it is time that we should part, lest Angelo should awake and miss you. In three months you shall be mistress here again."</p> 
               <p>"Three months? That is a long time, Senor."</p> 
               <p>"They will soon pass away, and you will see me often. When the time for action arrives, I will warn you in time to prepare you for the part you must play. At dawn I leave, but I shall shortly return to use all my arts to accomplish your wishes and my own. <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Addio,</foreign> my good Lisa, and consider your fortune as made."</p> 
                
               <p>Evoli moved lightly away, but the woman, forgetful of her recent terror lest her husband should discover her absence, sat cowering over the fire, indulging in sombre memories, and maturing future plans.</p> 
               <p>Lisa had been twice married, and at the time that Theodore Falcone perished, she lived among the hills as the wife of a small farmer. Her husband had often acted as one of Falcone's inferior agents, and when the broken health of his widow compelled her to seek a nurse for her infant, the charge was confided to Lisa, whose daughter was then only a few months old. After the death of his mother, Guilio remained under her care until he attracted the notice of Count Rospoli, who then took upon himself the charge of educating and protecting him.</p> 
               <p>Lisa loved the boy with passionate fondness, though her violent temper prevented her from making his childhood happy. With extreme reluctance she gave him up, though she was not separated from him. The convent into which he was received as a pupil was in the vicinity of her cottage, and Guilio was often found beneath its shelter. The attraction that drew him thither was his foster-sister, a dark-eyed gipsy, full of life and passion, who alternately pouted at or petted him.</p> 
               <p>Lisa's husband was now dead, and it became the dream of her life to see those children united when they arrived at years of maturity, though she was politic enough to conceal her wishes from the parties most interested in them. Guilio did not fall in love with Gulietta, but she conceived for him one of those passionate attachments known only to people of southern blood in all their vivid power. Lisa was left with very limited resources, but she toiled night and day to gain the means of educating her daughter in such a manner as to fit her to become the wife of her favorite.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta was placed in a convent to be instructed, and<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6335-00000142"/> the poor widow almost denied herself the means of living to keep her there. At length Guilio spurned the control of his patron, and took possession of his mountain strong-hold. He proposed to his foster-mother to take charge of his housekeeping, and she readily consented to do so; but to her extreme disappointment, he did not extend the invitation to Gulietta, who still remained in her convent.</p> 
               <p>A few weeks after her establishment at the cavern, Lisa married the herdsman, Angelo. She managed everything to suit herself, and looked forward with certainty to the future establishment of her daughter as the mistress of the eyrie and its master. How suddenly this dream was dispelled by the announcement of his intended marriage, how bitterly she resented preparations for the reception of his bride, made on a scale of elegance of which she had never before dreamed, it is needless to relate.</p> 
               <p>From the hour in which she first looked on Clarice, she hated her, and the fond devotion of Guilio only added bitterness to her dislike. Her daughter, in place of assuming the position of Mountain Queen, was forced to remain in her convent, and accept the humble position of a lay-sister till something better offered itself.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta wrote bitter and passionate reproaches to her mother for not better guarding her interests; and every word thus uttered only added intensity to the dislike of Lisa for her new mistress.</p> 
               <p>Clarice felt the repulsion, and made some efforts to overcome it; but finding that they were treated with a degree of coldness bordering even upon contempt, she assumed the privilege of her superior station, and treated Lisa with the distant civility which marks the intercourse of high-bred natures with those they consider as their inferiors.</p> 
               <p>This was adding insult to injury, and the quick temper of Lisa resented the assumption of Guilio's wife to rule over his foster-mother as her mistress. Thus the way lay open to the tempter, and he was not slow to avail himself of it, as we have seen.</p> 
               <p>When Lisa at length arose and prepared to retire, she had made up her mind to the course she would pursue.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," she muttered, as she slowly wound her way to her own portion of the cave, "now the mad woman is gone, I will send for Gulietta to help me, for there is more to do than I can attend to. Together, we shall be more than a match for this poor, silly, white-faced thing that Guilio was mad enough to prefer to my bright-eyed darling. Ah, yes-Gulietta shall be Queen of the Mountain yet."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">AN UNEXPECTED REVELATION.</head> 
               <p>IN spite of the understanding between Vivaldi and the parents of Lucille that he was still to be considered as the betrothed of their daughter, Madame Villeray contrived to render the position of the lovers as wretched as possible. She treated Francesco with the coolest contempt, laughed at his claims upon her daughter, and proclaimed everywhere in society that the marriage would certainly never take place. M. Villeray had antique notions of honor, and he insisted that loss of fortune did not entitle them to repudiate the tie they had so lately sanctioned, but time works wonders, and it must soon convince even him that people could not live upon nothing, or next to it. Ergo, Vivaldi and Lucille must give up their insane notion of marrying for love.</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray forced her daughter into society, and<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6335-00000143"/> encouraged the renewal of attentions on the part of her old admirers. They were not slow to take the hint, for the lovely young French girl was greatly admired among the cavaliers of her set, and poor Lucille, with sinking hopes and a preoccupied heart, was doomed to the persecution of listening to flatteries that were odious to her, while, at the same time, they rendered Vivaldi jealous and wretched.</p> 
               <p>Her position was a very trying one, for it required all her efforts to keep peace between her mother and her lover, while her own heart was torn with anxious doubts and fears as to the future that lay before her. The exact circumstances in which her family were placed were pitilessly paraded before her by her mother; the utter destitution in which they might be left by the sudden demise of M. Villeray, was dilated on at length, until the poor girl grew half wild over the dismal possibilities of the future.</p> 
               <p>In addition to this, the expensive trousseau which had been ordered for the intended bride of a millionaire arrived, and with it the enormous bills which were expected to be at once discharged. This was the more resolutely insisted upon by the agent, as Mademoiselle Villeray no longer had such brilliant prospects before her. It was nothing to him that the trousseau might not be needed at all, it must be paid for all the same, and the utmost resources that M. Villeray could command barely enabled him to settle for all this finery which would now be worse than useless.</p> 
               <p>The boxes were brought home, and Lucille sighed and wept over the charming toilettes in which she might have been so beautiful and so happy, had not a perverse fate thwarted her hopes. Her mother was alternately in ecstacies of delight over the exquisite dresses, and of despair that their fashion would have passed away before they could be put to their legitimate use. She consoled herself, however, with the thought that the jewels, laces and linen would still be as fresh as ever, and whenever her daughter did marry, these things would not be again to provide.</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray never wearied of inspecting these feminine treasures, and morning after morning was spent in looking them over, and criticizing the taste of the milliner, who had really spared neither expense nor skill in the selection of a trousseau worthy of so lovely and fortunate a bride as the betrothed of a millionaire was, of course, supposed to be.</p> 
               <p>Lucille listened with a sick heart, and almost loathed the sight of follies which she knew must so severely tax her father's slender resources. In the weeks that had elapsed since her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chateaux en Espagne</foreign> had been shattered, she had grown listless and indifferent. She passively opposed the resistance of a tenacious will to the evident intentions of her mother, but she was so quiet in her opposition that Madame Villeray thought her on the point of yielding to the force of her constantly repeated arguments against the folly of maintaining an engagement which could never be fulfilled, even when every emotion of her daughter's heart rose up in rebellion against her worldly maxims.</p> 
               <p>Lucille knew that it would be useless to argue with her mother. She would go around a circle, and come back precisely to the point from which she had started. There are people who never listen to the reasons of others when they clash with preconceived opinions of their own, and Madame Villeray was of this class.</p> 
               <p>She was now standing in front of her daughter's mirror, trying the effect of a magnificent head-dress which had been sent for her own use. Lucille was gazing dreamily through an open window which commanded a view of the bay, and as the sun flashed upon the restless waters, she thought of that morning beneath the lime trees where she had been so happy, of the change that so suddenly came<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6335-00000144"/> over her young life, just as a cloud was now sweeping up from the horizon, soon to overshadow the bright promise of the day.</p> 
               <p>Her mother's voice aroused her from her reverie, and she turned to see her bed covered with dresses, and Madame Villeray, with a gathering storm upon her brow, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"I declare it is shameful of that modiste! She has sent me a cap that is exquisite to hold upon the hand and examine, but its effect upon the face is dreadful. Look! It makes me some ten years older than I really am."</p> 
               <p>Lucille saw at once that the extreme delicacy of the ribbons and flowers no longer harmonized with the faded features of her mother, but she possessed too much tact to say so. She quietly removed the soft spring flowers, substituted roses of a deeper tint, and then replaced it upon her mother's head. Madame Villeray was enchanted, called her a fairy, and then actually kissed her. Lucille returned the caress, and turned again to the window, but her mother peevishly said:</p> 
               <p>"I wish you would attend to what is going on around you, Lucille, and not stare out of the window in that half-demented way. We must attend Senora Baliera's ball to-morrow night, and I wish you to select one of these dresses to wear. I am really sorry that the bridal robe is ornamented with orange blossoms, or you could appear in that. It will be long enough before it can be put to its legitimate use, and it is too beautiful to be laid away to grow yellow with time and neglect."</p> 
               <p>These words thoroughly aroused the young girl, and with flushing cheeks and tremulous voice, she said:</p> 
               <p>"Can you suppose that I will ever permit <emph>that</emph> dress to adorn me unless I wear it as the bride of Francesco? Truly, I must have fallen very low in your opinion, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma mre,</foreign> if you think I can be induced to parade myself at a ball in the robe consecrated to so different a use."</p> 
                
               <p>"Stuff! nonsense! You have all your father's high-flown notions about life and conduct. Here is a charming wardrobe; you are a young girl in society, without the means of providing another. The things are paid for, and must be worn, so it is useless for you to attempt to play the heroic about them. If you do not choose to wear the bridal robe just yet, here are others. This rose-colored crape, with these emeralds, will be lovely, and they just suit your style."</p> 
               <p>"But I do not wish to go to the ball. I have already been forced to go out many times when my heart recoiled from it. Francesco does not like it, and my father is so lonely when we are away."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense! Your father retires to bed at ten, and we seldom leave home before that hour. As to M. Vivaldi, I am not particular about pleasing him. The sooner he understands that everything between you must come to an end, the better it will be for you both."</p> 
               <p>"But he does not intend to understand anything of the kind, neither is it my intention to permit him to do so. I have promised you never to marry Francesco without your consent, but I have not consented to give him up."</p> 
               <p>"They are equivalent to each other, you ungrateful child, for I will <emph>never</emph> consent to give your hand to a man whose sword is his only fortune."</p> 
               <p>Lucille sat down with a resigned air. She had said all she considered necessary at the present moment, and she did not wish to exasperate her mother by any further display of feeling. She knew her own resolution to be immovable, and she could wait till a fairer prospect opened to her lover.</p> 
               <p>At that instant the door unclosed, and Madame Villeray's maid said:</p> 
               <p>"Madame, there is a visitor with M. Villeray, and he requests that both you and Mademoiselle will come down immediately."</p> 
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6335-00000145"/> 
               <p>"A visitor, Rosetta? Is it a gentleman or a lady?"</p> 
               <p>The girl hesitated as if uncertain how to class the individual referred to.</p> 
               <p>"It is a tall, dark woman, madame, wrapped in the ugly black thing the women of this island are so fond of wearing. M. Villeray seemed very glad to see her."</p> 
               <p>Lucille started up with animation, and exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"It must be Marie Montoni, and by a singular coincidence I have been thinking of her all the morning. I will go to her at once."</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray did not seem greatly pleased-she coldly said:</p> 
               <p>"I hope that half crazy creature has not really come back, to put more fantastic notions in your head than you already have there. Ah! there you go, without stopping to listen to me. If it was one of <emph>my</emph> friends, you would not be in such a hurry to welcome her."</p> 
               <p>The last words were unheard by Lucille. She was already out of the room, and in a few moments was in the library with Marie in her arms, for the young girl had known the poor wanderer in brighter days, and during the darkest hours of her life M. Villeray had been her firm and unfailing friend.</p> 
               <p>"Dear, dear Marie, how glad I am to see you again! How long you have been away, and how worn you look."</p> 
               <p>"And you, my pretty white rosebud, look as if the sunshine has not visited you of late," replied Marie, holding Lucille off, and gazing into her fair face with an expression of solicitude. "I dreamed that something has happened here to make you unhappy, and I came to see if it is so."</p> 
               <p>"As visionary as ever, Marie," said M. Villeray, with a forced smile. "Do not begin to sympathize with Lucille, or she will believe that her old father has wronged her, though God knows he has acted for the best."</p> 
                
               <p>"Then there <emph>is</emph> something wrong, and Lucille does not look so pale without cause. Oh! is happiness to be found upon this earth? Must blight and disappointment fall on all its children? My sweet Lucille, I trusted, might escape the doom of her sex, for if the evil of the father shall be visited upon his children, surely the good he has done should also descend on them as a blessing. If this were so, how richly dowered with happiness and good fortune <emph>your</emph> child should be, M. Villeray. Kind friend, my heart has folded in its deepest recesses the memory of all you did for me when life was dark, and hope lay dead within me."</p> 
               <p>"No more of that, Marie. I only did for you what any man worthy of the name would have done in my place. I trust that happiness and good fortune will indeed attend my darling Lucille, for they are likely to be the only dower she will possess. Come, sit down, and tell us of yourself. Where have you been wandering all these months, and why have you kept away from your old haunts so long?"</p> 
               <p>Marie still gazed wistfully upon the face of her young favorite, but Lucille smiled brightly, and the flitting color that gleamed upon her fair cheek partially reassured her friend. She accepted the offered seat, and commenced a rambling account of her late adventures. They were of little interest to her hearers, until she came to the marriage and subsequent elopement of Clarice from Isola Rossa.</p> 
               <p>With a few graphic touches, Marie described the romantic home of the newly-wedded pair, and dwelt on the devotion which led them to believe that life could be contentedly passed together in the solitude of their mountain fastness. Lucille listened with eager interest, and tears filled her eyes as she said.</p> 
               <p>"It is beautiful. It is noble. Oh, I trust that no cloud will ever come between these two faithful hearts. The vendetta will surely not be permitted to reach them."</p> 
               <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6335-00000146"/> 
               <p>Marie shuddered.</p> 
               <p>"I saw the mother of Matra as I passed through Isola Rossa, and she thinks vengeance has already been too long delayed. She is wild to gain a clue to Guilio's retreat, and take not only his life, but that of his bride. She offered me a large bribe to betray the secret of their retreat to her kinsmen, that they may invade it and wreak their vengeance upon its inmates."</p> 
               <p>"It is a dreadful state of society in which such things are tolerated," said M. Villeray, gravely. "In some of their habits, I am afraid, the Corsicans are half savage yet. But what became of the family of this young girl, and how have they escaped the fury of Matra's relatives?"</p> 
               <p>"That is the most singular and romantic portion of the story. To save herself and her children, Dame Marcante was forced to confess that Clarice is not her daughter. This she proved to the satisfaction of Matra's family, and thus was freed from the blood-vengeance."</p> 
               <p>"Romantic, indeed! Since the bride was not her child, to whom then did she belong?"</p> 
               <p>To the surprise of her two auditors, Marie suddenly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Do you remember the handsome lieutenant of hussars, who used to admire you so much, Lucille? With Senor Vivaldi the fate of my friend Clarice is singularly linked."</p> 
               <p>Lucille became very pale, as she faltered:</p> 
               <p>"Then your friend is the long lost cousin of Francesco. Yes, yes, it must be so."</p> 
               <p>Marie fixed her penetrating glance upon her.</p> 
               <p>"Then you know this story? You call this young man Francesco; I see it now. You favor his suit, but fortune frowns upon you. Hope is not dead, Lucille, and the flower of your love may yet revive beneath the revivifying influences of a golden shower."</p> 
                
               <p>"When the shower falls, it will be time enough to consider that question," said the sharp voice of Madame Villeray, who had entered the room unperceived.</p> 
               <p>Marie arose and received her welcome, which was given as coldly as politeness would permit. When they were again seated, Madame Villeray said:</p> 
               <p>"What is this about Lieutenant Vivaldi? Do you know the cousin who has come between him and his fine inheritance? What sort of a person is she? Will it not be the best thing the young man can do to go and marry her at once?"</p> 
               <p>"She is already married, Madame; but Clarice is noble and generous by nature, and I am sure she will act a liberal part toward her kinsman if she should claim the inheritance."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>If</emph> she claims it," repeated Madame Villeray, with a sneer. "I fancy there cannot be much doubt about that?"</p> 
               <p>"But in this case there is much doubt, Madame. The father of Clarice refuses to acknowledge her unless she gives up her husband; this, I am sure, she will never do, so Lieutenant Vivaldi may yet claim his uncle's fortune."</p> 
               <p>At these words Lucille clasped her hands so warmly, the cloud of care so visibly cleared from the brow of M. Villeray and Madame looked so astonished and pleased, that Marie needed no words to enlighten her as to the state of affairs. She said:</p> 
               <p>"My news affords you happiness, though I little dreamed that you had a vital interest in it when I began to relate this strange story."</p> 
               <p>Lucille leaned her head upon her shoulder, and whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You have brought back life and happiness to me, Marie. When we are alone, I will tell you all."</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray audibly said:</p> 
               <p>"Thank God for all his mercies;" and his wife fluttered<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6335-00000147"/> about the room in a state of excitement she could not control. She at length said:</p> 
               <p>"Who would believe in such madness? The girl will never have strength to refuse the brilliant future that Count Ernesti can offer his daughter. Francesco will not gain the inheritance-no, never. Marie, tell me again your grounds for this Quixotic belief of yours."</p> 
               <p>Marie went over the history of the attachment between Guilio and his bride, and repeated her own conviction that Clarice would remain true to her plighted faith, in defiance of temptation.</p> 
               <p>When she paused, Madame Villeray drew a long breath, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I trust it may prove so, for the sudden change in Senor Vivaldi's prospects has brought much misery into my family. My daughter has almost rebelled against me, though I have only done what prudence absolutely demanded of me as a good mother. Francesco will probably call today. Send word to the porter to admit him, Lucille; and now I think of it, he has not had a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte-a-tte</foreign> with you for some time. I believe I will relax my vigilance a little, and permit you to sit under the lime trees as you did before the news came that his cousin had been found. If this young girl chooses to throw her good fortune away, it places Vivaldi exactly where he stood before her existence was ascertained. I am sorry that I did not comprehend that affairs might take this turn; but who could believe that a woman who will give up rank and fortune for love could have been found in this world?"</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Madame, all women are not to be judged by the same standard," said Marie, with unconscious severity. "There are natures so noble that the sacrifices they make are not considered as such by themselves, though the rest of the world may look on in astonishment."</p> 
                
               <p>"I am glad that I do not belong to that class of simpletons," replied Madame Villeray, rather brusquely. "People that live in the world, and have a position to maintain, do not throw away their best chances in life as this wilful countess seems ready to do. I think that she will yet find that she has sold her birthright for a mess of something the priest told me an old Hebrew once sold his for. We owed a duty to our child, which we have fulfilled. Since Francesco has a prospect of succeeding to his uncle's wealth, there is nothing more to be said. The wedding prepraations can be resumed, and the trousseau will not have been bought in vain."</p> 
               <p>The father sighed, as he thought that his darling must indeed soon be given to the protection of one whose claims upon her would be superior to his own; but when he looked into that sweet face that was lately so clouded, and saw there the rose of happiness and hope again flushing into beauty upon the cheek which had begun to grow alarmingly pale, he was almost consoled.</p> 
               <p>At that instant a quick, eager step was heard without, and Vivaldi entered the room. He had been told by the servant that Lucille was with her father; but he paused, surprised at the presence of a stranger. With outstretched hand, and gracious smile, Madame Villeray advanced to greet him, and in her most dulcet tones, said:</p> 
               <p>"You are welcome among us again, Senor Vivaldi; and I am happy to be the first to inform you of the good fortune that is probably in store for you."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi seemed bewildered by this sudden change in her manner, and he looked toward M. Villeray for an explanation.</p> 
               <p>"I-I am really at a loss to know what can have happened, Madame; but be it what it may, if it restores to me the hope of a speedy alliance with your family, I shall consider myself among the happiest of men."</p> 
               <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6335-00000148"/> 
               <p>"My dear Francesco, you know that we have ever esteemed you personally as the most desirable of sons, but our imperative duty was to guard the interests of our daughter. It seems that they will no longer suffer by a union with you, so M. Villeray and myself withdraw our objections to your future marriage with Lucille.</p> 
               <p>"Madame, M. Villeray," replied the young man, with dignity, "I wish you both to understand that I will no longer be trifled with in an affair so vital to my happiness. I do not know what has wrought such a change in your views, but I demand that the consent now given to my union with your daughter shall be held irrevocable, whatever may happen in the future."</p> 
               <p>He looked toward the father, who instantly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is but just to you and our child that it shall be so considered. Lucille, give your betrothed your hand, in token that the compact is sealed. I pledge my word, as a man of honor, that it shall be held sacred."</p> 
               <p>How tenderly, how reverently that little fluttering hand was clasped; how much was said in the look their eyes exchanged, need not be explained in words. When Vivaldi could think of anything aside from the great and unexpected happiness that filled his heart, he asked:</p> 
               <p>"What miracle has been accomplished in my favor? I came hither jealous, and almost despairing-scarcely hoping to be permitted even to see Lucille, and am met with this unlooked for and most gratifying reception. What has wrought so great a change?"</p> 
               <p>M. Villeray hesitated and changed color, for he felt ashamed to say that the improvement in his worldly prospects was the source of his welcome; but his wife had no such scruples. A true Parisienne, it seemed to her the most natural thing in the world that the man who, without fortune, might not aspire to her daughter, was, as its possessor sessor, welcome to her hand. With perfect coolness she said:</p> 
               <p>"Senora Montoni has brought us the unlooked for information that your cousin will relinquish the fortune bequeathed to her on such singular conditions, and you will yet claim it as heir-at-law."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi turned quickly toward the dark figure he had hitherto scarcely noticed. He recognized her name, recalled her touching history, and with an emotion almost of reverence, he approached Marie, and raising her hand respectfully to his lips, said:</p> 
               <p>"Permit me, Senora, to offer my homage to one of the most courageous and most unfortunate of modern heroines. Your story is well known to me, and your devotion reverenced. Thanks for your endeavors to serve me; they shall not be forgotten."</p> 
               <p>Marie smiled faintly, and for an instant seemed bewildered by his sudden address. She passed her hand over her brow, and slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"You owe me no thanks, Senor. When I commenced the relation of what has happened to me in my late wanderings, I was not aware that the happiness of my young friend here was concerned in what I had to tell. I am glad to have been the bearer of good tidings, for what I have said will, I am sure, prove true."</p> 
               <p>"Sit down, Marie, and tell Vivaldi the whole story. He will hear it with as deep interest as we have felt in its details," said M. Villeray.</p> 
               <p>The group gathered around the narrator, and Vivaldi was soon in possession of such facts as were necessary to the full comprehension of his position. When Marie ended, he reflected a few moments, and then said:</p> 
               <p>"If my cousin and myself could divide the inheritance it would seem only just; but the terms of the will expressly<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6335-00000149"/> forbid that. The fortune our uncle spent his life in accumulating, must go entire to either one or the other; yet the noble renunciation this young creature is willing to make for the sake of her husband shall never be forgotten by me. As far as I can, I will make amends to her for the sacrifice that secures my happiness. Have you seen her since she learned her father's decision, Senora?"</p> 
               <p>"No-we parted on the day she received it. What I have told you I learned from the agent who brought Count Ernesti's letter. Captain Barnardo was once a friend of her family, and from him I learned the particulars I have related. But from previous conversations with Clarice, no doubt is left in my mind that she will refuse her father's offers; for he insists that she shall give up a husband to whom she is devoted, or forfeit her birthright."</p> 
               <p>"And is there no chance that Count Ernesti will relent? He may finally receive his daughter on her own terms, sooner than permit her to live as the wife of an obscure outlaw," said Madame Villeray, anxiously. "He is powerful enough to have this Falcone ennobled. Should he do this, your chances to inherit the estate are very slender, Senor Vivaldi."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so," replied Vivaldi, coolly; "but <emph>my</emph> prize is secured to me, let the result be what it may. I have the pledged word of M. Villeray and yourself that Lucille shall give me her hand at an early day. I can wait patiently for the decision of Count Ernesti and his daughter."</p> 
               <p>"But you misunderstood <emph>me,</emph> Senor. Only as the undoubted heir of your uncle, I again repeat, will I permit you to claim my daughter as your wife."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi turned appealingly toward M. Villeray, who here interposed with an air of decision unusual with him when engaged in a contest with his wife.</p> 
               <p>"I have given my word, Madame; and it shall be kept. So honorable and true a man as I recognize Francesco to be, is worthy of our child, and he shall claim her with or without the inheritance. He will make her happy, and that is all I ask."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi warmly grasped one of his hands, while Lucille pressed the other to her heart with an expression of joy that deeply moved the old man.</p> 
               <p>Pale with anger, Madame Villeray spoke:</p> 
               <p>"We shall see, Monsieur. The marriage shall <emph>not</emph> take place till this question is finally decided. A sudden conviction has come to my mind that this girl will not refuse the terms of her father; that she will claim her own; and you, Senor, will be exactly where you stood this morning-a poor lieutenant, with nothing but your empty hand to offer to a descendant of my noble house!"</p> 
               <p>She swept from the room, leaving those within it looking mutely at each other. Lucille struggled to maintain her calmness, but this sudden overthrow of her hopes was too hard to bear, and she burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Do not weep, my daughter," said M. Villeray, tenderly. "Retire with your friend, and leave me to talk over this matter with Vivaldi. My will for once shall rule in this house, as you shall see."</p> 
               <p>A few murmured sentences passed between the lovers, and then Lucille departed with Marie.</p> 
               <p>The conference between the two gentlemen was long and earnest, and it was definitely settled that so soon as Vivaldi could gain his promotion, and the certainty of a support, he might claim his bride.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BANKER AND HIS WIFE.</head> 
               <p>EVOLI reached Bastia a few hours after Marie appeared at the house of M. Villeray. His first object was to obtain a correct knowledge of the provisions of Tomaso Vivaldi's will, that he might understand on what ground he must stand with his nephew, in the interview he came to seek. If that document permitted such a division of the estate as was proposed by Guilio, he would suppress the letter of which he was the bearer, and carry back such a report of the failure of his embassy, as must destroy all hope of claiming any portion of the estate.</p> 
               <p>But if a restriction of that kind existed, it would be safe to see Vivaldi, and ascertain with what manner of man he had to deal in the relations that might hereafter rise between them.</p> 
               <p>It was twilight when he entered the town, and he went at once to the villa of the wealthy banker. Since his exile this was not the first visit he had made to his friend Baliera, for the latter was bound to him by many strong ties, both of interest and affection. To Evoli he was indebted for his present position as consul, and also in a great measure for the prosperity he enjoyed. On sending in a slip of paper with a few mystic characters scrawled upon it, Evoli was instantly admitted to the private room of the banker, who stood ready to welcome him with outstretched arms.</p> 
               <p>"My dear duke, is this really you? For the last two days, I have been seeking the means of forwarding a letter to you which lately came from Italy. How fortunate that you should have arrived so opportunely."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, that is good news indeed, though I suppose it only brings me leave to return there and vegetate in one of my country-houses, provided I will not meddle in political affairs again. Eh? Is it not so?"</p> 
               <p>"You are right, as you always are, my lord. Permission to return and manage your estates is fully granted, but you must pledge yourself to remain quiet."</p> 
               <p>"Such is my intention; for the present, I give up ambition. Aspirations for the elevation of my country, have led me into too many difficulties, and I relinquish the struggle till a better day dawns on Italy. But where is my letter?"</p> 
               <p>Baliera drew one from a portfolio and presented it to him. Evoli glanced rapidly over its contents, then thrusting it in his pocket, said:</p> 
               <p>"I am glad that I can return at my pleasure, for soon it may be necessary to my plans to do so. And now I can see that you are curious to learn what has brought me here in this peasant's garb."</p> 
               <p>"If it be not indiscreet, I should like to be enlightened."</p> 
               <p>"It is a simple affair, and easily explained. You know I have been the companion of Falcone for many months. He has incurred the vendetta, and could not come hither to attend himself to the settlement of some business in which he is interested. Can you tell me how I can obtain a sight of Tomaso Vivaldi's will? for I understand that a copy of it has been sent to an agent here."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! has that fruitful subject of gossip reached even your mountain solitudes? For the last three months it has been discussed here, and the presumptive heir has been the lion of the hour. It turns out, however, that Vivaldi will be compelled to resign his pretensions in favor of a long-lost cousin who was spirited away in her infancy, but has been found just in the nick of time."</p> 
               <p>"I know more about that part of the story than you can tell me. But where can I find the will, for I must see it as soon as possible."</p> 
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6335-00000151"/> 
               <p>"It is here, and I am the agent referred to. But pray explain how you came to know of its existence, and what interest your outlawed friend can have in it?"</p> 
               <p>In a few brief sentences Evoli gave as much information as he deemed expedient, and Baliera in return produced a formidable looking parchment, and placed it before him. In a short time Evoli mastered its contents so far as they could be of use to himself, and with a feeling of repressed triumph, he said:</p> 
               <p>"The old miser was determined that his hordes should not be scattered. He ties up the property in such a manner as to preclude all chance of a compromise between the heirs. The young countess must take all, or reject all."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, there can be no evasion in this case. If Count Ernesti refuses to comply with the conditions dictated to him, he strips his daughter of her inheritance. But the girl will scarcely hold to her determination to abide by the lowly and wretched life she has chosen."</p> 
               <p>"Not if <emph>I</emph> can prevent it," replied Evoli, significantly.</p> 
               <p>"And who could more easily do so?" replied the Italian, with a sly laugh. "The reputation of the Duke of Evoli as the most admired and successful of cavaliers, is well known to me already."</p> 
               <p>Evoli reflected a moment, and then seemed to consider it necessary to vindicate his reputation to a man who was at least thoroughly acquainted with his weaknesses, as well as with his better qualities. He gravely said:</p> 
               <p>"The world might probably condemn me, and accuse me of betraying the man whose bread I have broken; but this is a peculiar case. This young girl, believing she was marrying her equal, and blinded by one of those ephemeral passions which are common to inexperienced children, gave her hand to a man who is every way her inferior. It turns out that she is not only high-born, but magnificently dowered ered. In addition to this, nature has given her beauty and refinement of a high order. With the slender advantages afforded her, she has grown into a graceful and fascinating womanhood, that might shame half the daughters of fashion and culture. Behold this exquisite creature condemned to live as the wife of an outlaw, and see for yourself how fitness would be outraged in permitting her to abide by the lot she has chosen. Guilio is a good fellow, and very much in love with his Peri; but her wings must soon lift her beyond his sphere, and I will aid her to plume them for a flight which shall end--"</p> 
               <p>He paused, and Baliera quietly added:</p> 
               <p>"In your arms, my lord. I see plainly that her husband is not the only one madly enamored of this peerless senora. But how are you to dispose of this mountain chieftain? The Corsican heart is easily fired with jealousy, and wrong of this nature is never forgiven. His carbine or his dagger will surely reach you."</p> 
               <p>Evoli made a gesture of impatience:</p> 
               <p>"Falcone is already the object of deadly vendetta. He tore his bride almost from the altar, and in the melee that followed his rival was slain. The family of Matra have sworn vengeance against him; and they will surely accomplish it. Without raising my finger against him, Guilio will be removed from my path."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, I know something of that Matra. Information has been laid before me of dealings on his part which lead to the supposition that he was no better than a pirate, for he was certainly in league with one."</p> 
               <p>"My friend, Barnardo, I suppose you allude to," replied Evoli, coolly. "I have long suspected as much, but he has managed hitherto to keep out of serious difficulties, and it is not my wish that he shall be interfered with yet awhile. He can be of material use to me, and in fact I have pledged<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6335-00000152"/> him my word to serve him when I return to my native land."</p> 
               <p>"Then," replied the consul, respectfully, "I will ignore the communication, though it came from a very respectable source. It will be as well, however, for you to warn him that suspicion has been aroused against him, and he had better confine himself to smuggling. The authorities can wink at that, when the greater crime could not be overlooked."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, I will answer for him for the next three months. After that time I shall probably see fit to place him in a more honorable position than he now holds."</p> 
               <p>"Since you are kind enough to interest yourself in him, my lord, I consider his fortune as made. But you will balance this liberality by ruining the prospects of as good a lad as lives. Poor Vivaldi will lose his promised bride, I am afraid, if you induce the heiress to claim her fortune."</p> 
               <p>"How is this?" asked Evoli, with interest.</p> 
               <p>Baliera, whose wife was the chosen friend and confidante of Lucille, gave the history of herself and her lover, to which Evoli eagerly listened. When it was finished, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I came hither to seek an interview with Vivaldi, for I am the bearer of a letter from Falcone proposing to divide the estate. This, it seems, cannot be done, but when I have carried out <emph>my</emph> plans, I can easily offer to Lieutenant Vivaldi such an equivalent as will entitle him to claim the hand of M. Villeray's daughter. If I remember aright, he is a French refugee, living upon the wreck of his fortune."</p> 
               <p>"That is true, but Madame is of high family, and expects great wealth, or noble blood, in her future son-in-law."</p> 
               <p>"Great expectations are seldom fulfilled," said Evoli, coldly. "Madame Villeray must be taught to lower her pretensions, natural as they may be where an only daughter is concerned."</p> 
                
               <p>"He would be a bold man who would undertake to convince her of that," replied Baliera, shrugging his shoulders. "Of all the women known to me, I consider Madame the most unreasonable."</p> 
               <p>"It is always well to understand the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte du pays,</foreign>" said Evoli, laughing. "But I think I can find means to reach this fiery dame, even if her stilts do lift her so far above the heads of common mortals. I should like to see the young lady, too, for your description has interested me."</p> 
               <p>"If you will honor us with your presence at a fancy ball my wife gives to-morrow night, you can have the opportunity you desire. Madame Villeray has positively promised to come and bring her daughter with her. Since the ban is removed from you, you can appear without danger to yourself."</p> 
               <p>"I should not wish to be known, but I can easily disguise myself so as not to be recognized. The temptation is really great, besides, I can thus meet Vivaldi with all the mystery that would give piquancy to our interview. He will, of course, accompany his betrothed."</p> 
               <p>"If the old dragon will permit it. She keeps him off or on, as his chances to gain the estate rise or fall."</p> 
               <p>"Then he will be sure to accompany her, for a friend of Falcone's has come hither, and she is now in the house of M. Villeray as a guest. She will induce them to believe that Clarice will never give up her husband. Thus the claim of Vivaldi will seem to be in the ascendant, and he will be smiled on again."</p> 
               <p>"You speak like one who knows, yet you are no wizard. How in the name of all the Fates came a friend of your wild outlaw to be visiting the aristocratic dame of M. Villeray?"</p> 
               <p>"It is Marie Montoni, the improvisatrice, who is known to every one through the tragic incidents of her early life. She accompanied Clarice to the cavern, and I have heard her<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6335-00000153"/> speak of M. Villeray and his daughter as her best friends in Bastia."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! poor Marie! hers is indeed a sad story, and I think her mind has been a little astray ever since that dreadful night when she bore the body of her lover to its grave. If she is with the Villerays, we must send her an invitation to come to our festival. The time has been when that half distraught creature was the life of the gayest ball-room. Her family repudiate her, but they are the only ones who cannot see the heroism of her nature."</p> 
               <p>"Have her here, by all means, for I wish to speak a few words with her before I leave. I can easily guard against detection till I wish to make myself known, and by my superior finesse, grasp the destiny of all these people in the hollow of my hand. I rely on you, Baliera, to aid me in this as faithfully as I have served you in other days."</p> 
               <p>"I needed not that reminder, my lord. I am devoted to your service, as you have heretofore had good reason to know."</p> 
               <p>"That is true; you have been faithful to me in adversity, and I see the day approaching when I can do something in return more important to your future elevation than I did when I procured you the petty office of consul here. I shall not forget your interests, you may be sure."</p> 
               <p>Baliera expressed his thanks, and then the two had many incidents to relate which derived interest from the early relations that had existed between them. Baliera was the son of a noble but impoverished family, and the father of Evoli had received him as a page in his household. The young heir took a fancy to him, and insisted that he should share his studies. The two grew to manhood together, and a strong bond of attachment existed between them. Baliera made an early and imprudent marriage, and he would have fallen into the deepest poverty but for the efforts of his friend to place him in a position to ensure independence. The office of Consul at Bastia was obtained for him through Evoli's interest, and a sum of money, furnished by the same liberal hand, enabled him to become a partner in a private banking establishment, which prospered beyond his hopes.</p> 
               <p>Senor Baliera was a small, sharp-looking man, with a keen eye to his own advantage, and no strongly-defined principles. He adored his wife, was faithful to his friend, and careful of his worldly chances; and he flattered himself that the whole destiny of man was comprised in these duties. He was not shocked at the treachery Evoli had developed to him, for he had a vague notion that a man on whom the ban of society had fallen, had forfeited all rights, and if the vendetta was carried out against Falcone, it was only a rude kind of justice against a man who had placed himself beyond the reach of the law. His worldly shrewdness led him to believe that Clarice must eventually become disgusted with the solitude of her mountain life, and he considered it right that the daughter of a noble house should be torn, even by violence, from the arms of her plebeian husband. Thus he was quite ready to aid Evoli in every possible manner to carry out his plans.</p> 
               <p>Senora Baliera was soon made aware of the presence of her husband's distinguished guest, and every preparation was made to do honor to him. She was a brilliant little brunette, whose vivacity and grace vindicated the good taste of her husband. She was very fond of society, and the balls given at her house were the most agreeable reunions in the town. The one to which she was now looking forward was to exceed in brilliancy all that had preceded it, and great was the exultation of the little woman when she learned that her husband's early friend and patron, the handsome and magnificent Duke of Evoli, would grace her festival with his presence.</p> 
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6335-00000154"/> 
               <p>Her elation was a little clouded, however, when she learned that he would appear only in mask, as, for reasons of his own, Evoli did not wish his true rank to be suspected. The husband easily satisfied her that this was absolutely necessary to the safety of his friend, and with a sigh she gave up the brilliant vision of appearing before her guests attended by one of the most elegant men she had ever seen, who, in addition, was the head of one of the proudest Italian families.</p> 
               <p>An invitation was despatched to Marie Montoni, with a polite little note from Senora Baliera expressing the hope that she would accept it, as a friend of hers would be present who wished to have an interview with her under the shelter of his mask. He had something of importance to the welfare of her mountain friends to communicate, which it would be well for her to hear.</p> 
               <p>The reception of this note filled Marie with surprise, and also excited her greatly. After reading it several times, she carried it with her into Lucille's room to consult with her as to the propriety of accepting the invitation. She could not think, without a shudder, of again standing amid the glare and crush of a ball-room; for the last time she had entered one she was accompanied by him she had so fondly loved, so fatally lost; but if the interests of Guilio and his bride were to be served by doing so, she could not hesitate.</p> 
               <p>She found Lucille preparing the dress of a water-nymph, in which character her mother had consented she should appear. She glanced at the perturbed face of Marie, and turning from her occupation, asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Marie? You seem troubled."</p> 
               <p>"I thought I had attended my last ball," she replied, with a faint attempt to smile, "but it seems that I was mistaken. Read this note from Senora Baliera, and then tell me how I can enter her rooms without being recognized except by the mysterious person who wishes to converse with me concerning Guilio and his bride."</p> 
               <p>Lucille read the note with much interest, and immediately said:</p> 
               <p>"I am glad we can take you with us on any terms. Let me see-oh! I have it. You can go as a fortune-teller, with your head-dress so arranged as to conceal your features. Furnished with the bones used by the Corsicans in divination, you will doubtless be quite as successful in foretelling the future as most necromancers are."</p> 
               <p>The face of Marie cleared; she slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"That will do-my usual dress will answer for a sibyl, and the use of the bones is familiar to me. I have often foretold the future from them."</p> 
               <p>"And you really believe in this strange method of reading the future?" asked Lucille, playfully.</p> 
               <p>Marie gravely replied:</p> 
               <p>"Why not? Every nation has its favorite method of divination, and ours is by such simple means as the polished shoulder blade of a sheep or goat; but, mind you, it must be from the left shoulder, for the right one often deceives. When the bone is made perfectly smooth, the lines upon it are as clear to me as those on a map. The destiny of many distinguished Corsicans has been foretold in this way, and I learned the art from an adept in the science."</p> 
               <p>"Then you shall predict my fortune. But what great man has verified the prophecies so curiously revealed?"</p> 
               <p>"The greatest one of modern times. While yet a boy, Napoleon's career was foretold by a Corsican shepherd. The diviner found stamped upon the shoulder-blade a tree with a multitude of branches, but the roots were few and feeble. Thus was foreshadowed the rise and fall of the conqueror."</p> 
               <p>"Really, if true, it was very singular. I will order a small basket of bones to be prepared for you, and you can<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6335-00000155"/> astonish the people you will meet at Senor Baliera's by the skill you will display. I fancy, however, in most cases, you will be forced to draw on your imagination to fill up the programme."</p> 
               <p>Marie smiled vaguely as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"With some people with whom I am thrown in contact, I seem to come at once into <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rapport,</foreign> and a bewildering, confused mirage floats before my mental vision, in which I catch glimpses of their past, and future. With others, and they are the many, the oracle is dumb. Lately I have been thrown much with one who filled me with a vague kind of antipathy, and his future would arise before me clouded with darkness, and ruin to those I love. It is he, I am sure, who seeks to meet me now, though how or why he came hither is concealed from me."</p> 
               <p>Lucille looked upon the still face, with its large eyes fixed on vacancy, and asked, almost in a whisper:</p> 
               <p>"If you really possess this power, Marie, whence was it derived?"</p> 
               <p>"From ruined hopes, from crushed reason. It arose upon the night of my despair, as a beacon to warn others of the breakers that threaten to overwhelm their bark of life. I try to use it to a good purpose, for God help me! it is all the good that is left me to do now."</p> 
               <p>She covered her face with her hands and sank shivering upon a chair. Her young companion regarded her with tender compassion, but she did not venture to question her further. She gently said:</p> 
               <p>"I will answer Senora Baliera's note, and so arrange it that you need not enter the ball-room at all. The grounds are spacious, and a suitable place for a sibyl can be found far from the dancers."</p> 
               <p>Marie gladly assented to this proposal, and Lucille hastily dashed off the following lines to her friend:</p>

               <p>Senora Baliera was the only intimate friend Lucille possessed, and to her faithful keeping was confided the innocent hopes and sorrows of her young life. The happy wife took a keen interest in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> of this love drama, which carried her back to the days of her own doubts and fears, when prudence forbade a marriage which she risked with all its chances of future poverty, and found her reward in so doing. She read Lucille's reply with eager interest, and immediately set herself to the task of having the spot indicated prepared for the occupation of Marie.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BALL. A STRANGE GUEST, AND WHAT WAS DONE BY HIM.</head> 
               <p>SENORA BALIERA was an ambitious little woman, who wished to signalize her ball by something more striking than an elegant supper, and fine music, to which twinkling feet should keep time; she desired this entertainment to be<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6335-00000156"/> remembered, and spoken of as unique in its character, while, at the same time, it should increase the popularity of her husband with the excitable people he had come to dwell among. She took intense interest in the traditions of the island which had become her home; and the martial character of the Corsicans, their indomitable spirit of independence, delighted her. She wished to give something of a national character to the entertainment she had prepared, and arrangements had been made for the performance of the Corsican weapon-dance during the evening.</p> 
               <p>The Moresca does not belong exclusively to them, however, for it is also danced in other countries, but in Corsica its character is entirely chivalric. In all ages this dance, which is the very embodiment of the poetry of war, has been practised by them in seasons of great national peril, when the courage of the laggard needed rousing by reminding him of the great deeds of his forefathers.</p> 
               <p>On this evening it was to be represented on a small scale, but the villa occupied by Senor Baliera had extensive grounds, which might be made to serve as an amphitheatre for the performers.</p> 
               <p>An open space of green sward, encircled by majestic trees, and bounded by masses of thick shrubbery, was brilliantly illuminated, and a small summer-house on one side represented the gates of the town threatened with invasion. The guests, in every variety of brilliant, picturesque, and fantastic costumes, gathered in groups to witness the spirited scene about to be enacted, and among them was Madame Villeray and her daughter, escorted by Vivaldi. They, however, did not mingle with the crowd, but occupied the grotto which had been prepared for the reception of Marie Montoni. This spot commanded a perfect view of the scene of action, as it was built upon a projecting spur from the hillside, which overlooked the esplanade beneath.</p> 
                
               <p>Senora Baliera had been with them but a few moments, as her presence was needed elsewhere: and she could only offer a cordial welcome to her strange guest, and show her how cleverly she had fitted up the shrine of Fate, at which she was to preside. The grotto was a fantasy of her own; it was decorated within with mosses, spars, and shells, arranged so skilfully as to have the wild and picturesque effect of nature; and one might have fancied that Titania herself had presided over its construction, while the spirits of the air had been its architects.</p> 
               <p>It was an exquisite little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bijou,</foreign> placed in a rocky recess, which was approached by a winding avenue of lime-trees, whose branches formed an arch overhead. It was converted now into a pavilion, by placing heavy crimson curtains in front, which were drawn back and held in loose folds by silken cords. A marble table, a tripod, and a vase filled with polished bones, were placed within; and a pale, emerald light was diffused over the whole by means of a lamp, with a green glass shade placed behind a sparry screen.</p> 
               <p>In its wan scintillations, with her black dress, and flowing hair half-covered with a scarlet mandille, Lucille insisted she should wear, Marie looked the very embodiment of the character she had assumed. She had loosened her abundant black tresses, and brought them forward in such a manner as partially to veil her face, for she had a nervous dread of being recognized; while some power she could neither control nor comprehend, impelled her to seek the interview she instinctively feared, though she could not have told wherefore, so vague was the impression of something evil which she must grapple with, and if possible overcome.</p> 
               <p>Lucille, in a pale, sea-green skirt, covered with clouds of filmy lace, her light hair bound with sea grasses and water lilies, long sprays of which adorned her dress, was a charming representative of Undine. Pearls of rare value and<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6335-00000157"/> lustre gleamed upon her neck and arms, which only seemed to gain additional fairness from the contrast. Bright, fresh and happy, the young girl offered a striking contrast to the wan and worn figure of the sibyl, though even over her the emerald light cast a strange pallor, wakening in the heart of her lover the wish to withdraw her from its influence into an atmosphere more suited to her sweet and genial nature.</p> 
               <p>As Vivaldi was aware, however, that this was the best point of observation for the spectacle of the Moresca, he made no such attempt for the present. The scene below them was so striking that even Madame Villeray soon forgot to complain of the discomfort of the rustic seat on which she had placed herself to overlook the pageant.</p> 
               <p>The esplanade was lighted by long wreaths of colored lamps, extending from tree to tree, and gleaming like stars amid the foliage. The brilliant crowd, in gay fancy costumes and flashing jewels, gathered in groups in the best positions for seeing their national dance, and chatted, laughed and enjoyed themselves with that abandon peculiar to people of southern temperament, while a fine band filled the air with its inspiring music.</p> 
               <p>At a given signal the performers ceased, and a single bugle note, clear, shrill, and piercing, seemed to reach the very welkin. At this sound, the door of the summer-house unclosed, and a Moorish astrologer came forth. He looked up to the heavens, consulted the stars, and rushed back dismayed at the dire portents he there beheld. Then came another trumpet-blast, and a messenger in hot haste rushed forward and announced that the Genoese had taken two of their fortified towns, and were now marching to Bastia. He disappeared within the summer-house, and the defenders of the town appeared, headed by a tall, graceful knight, in gorgeous dress and floating plumes, who assumed for a time the character of Pasquale Paoli. His followers were all clad in flowing Roman togas of white material, and armed with a sword in the right hand and a dagger in the left.</p> 
               <p>Vivas and clapping of hands welcomed them, which were half drowned by a loud burst of music from horns and trumpets. Then came their opponents, dressed in scarlet togas, and armed in the same manner.</p> 
               <p>A breathless silence here fell upon the crowd, the faint vibrations of the trumpet faded away in the distance, and the notes of a single violin were heard. It was touched with masterly skill, and its piercing melody filled every leafy covert with its sound.</p> 
               <p>The two leaders advanced to the measured cadence, followed by thirty dancers on each side; they weave through the figures of the Moresca, striking their weapons against each other with a clashing sound, and keeping exact time to the music. The white and scarlet figures mingle in one wild maze, and the light flashes upon their swordblades as thrusts are parried, and blows evaded.</p> 
               <p>Then they separate, each party forms a crescent, moving for a brief space in its own orbit, but to meet again in wilder, fiercer motion. The scene grows almost fearful from its appearance of reality, and the actors seemed moved with the spirit of mortal strife. Blow rings on blow and the faces of these excitable Southrons begin to flash with the fury of a real contest, when the trumpet summons the party supposed to be conquered to surrender. Their weapons are at once lowered, and the stirring pageant is over.</p> 
               <p>The performers mingle with the crowd, the band strikes up, and the company seek the ball-room to join in the less exciting waltz.</p> 
               <p>Our little party had watched the whole performance with breathless interest, and both Lucille and Marie had kept their eyes fixed upon the striking figure of the plumed knight who led the Corsicans. The first was attracted by<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6335-00000158"/> the singular grace and dignity of his bearing, the last by the species of fascination which the reptile exercises over the fluttering bird it lures within its power. Lucille asked of Vivaldi:</p> 
               <p>"Who is the tall knight who represents the great Paoli? He should be <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans peur et sans reproche</foreign> to assume the character of so great and good a man."</p> 
               <p>"Yet I am very sure that he is neither," muttered Marie; but her words were not listened to.</p> 
               <p>"That is the stranger who only came to Bastia on yesterday. He wishes to maintain his incognita, but I have learned that the Duke of Evoli, the early friend and patron of Senor Baliera, is now visiting him, and I think that is he."</p> 
               <p>At these words the interest of Madame Villeray was suddenly aroused; she eagerly said:</p> 
               <p>"Ah, he is a great <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parti;</foreign> the richest nobleman in Italy, and almost of princely rank. He is unmarried, I believe?"</p> 
               <p>"He is, Madame," replied Vivaldi, coldly, almost haughtily, for he read the thought that prompted the inquiry. He answered it by adding, "Men of his rank only wed their equals in birth and fortune."</p> 
               <p>"Not always," said Madame, with equal asperity. "Love and beauty sometimes tell a different story. Lucille, love, let me see how you are looking to-night. Ah! I am glad you thought of coming as Undine, for the dress is very becoming to you."</p> 
               <p>"Not by this light, Madame," said Vivaldi, "for in its beams we all look like pale phantoms from the deep. Let us seek the ball-room; I am not afraid to trust Lucille even where the glamour of this handsome stranger may be thrown around her. I should be unworthy to win her, if I have not that much confidence in her."</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray bit her lip, but made no reply. After all, Vivaldi might prove the safest card, and Lucille seemed stupidly resolute to favor no other suitor. She arose and took the young man's offered arm, and Lucille made a last effort to induce Marie to make one tour of the ball-room and see the masquers. Marie shook her head.</p> 
               <p>"No, no-not there. I cannot summon courage to enter such a scene again. Let those who wish to consult me seek me here. Do not hesitate to leave me alone, Lucille, for solitude is always welcome to me. Here I can sit and dream, and conjure back the past, through the divine gift of memory."</p> 
               <p>"Then I will leave you for a season. Hark! how the gay strains of music seem to wreathe and dance in merry waves upon the soft air. Ah, it must be a scene of enchantment in the ball-room."</p> 
               <p>Printing a light kiss upon the sibyl's brow, Lucille tripped away with feet winged by impatience to join the revellers. The guests had been required to appear in fancy costume, but masks were not assumed except at the desire of the wearer. Madame Villeray wore the dress of a French marchioness of the ancient rgime, the stately splendor of which suited her style, and set off the remains of the beauty she had once possessed.</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi, in the magnificent court dress of a Hungarian noble, was one of the most striking figures in the motley crowd of courtiers, cardinals, and harlequins, amid which they soon found themselves. Lucille, in her light, foamy-looking toilette, seemed indeed a young Venus just from the sea, or better still, what she represented, a pure water-sprite, without the taint of passion which mars the ideal of the goddess.</p> 
               <p>Senora Baliera stood at the upper end of the ballroom dispensing smiles and gracious nods to her guests. She wore the picturesque dress of a Neapolitan peasant girl, and<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6335-00000159"/> the charming coquetry of her manner, the sparkling brightness of her large dark eyes, gave piquancy to its effect. Her husband, as a rural Boniface, was circulating among the crowd, sustaining his assumed character with such wit and good humor as won him hosts of friends.</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi had wished to appear as Rudolph, the lover of Undine, but to this her mother had positively objected. She chose to consider the union of the lovers as a possibility which might never be realized, and she did not wish to give the little world around them additional reason for linking their names together. Great, then, was the chagrin of Vivaldi when a tall knight, masked, and wearing the dress of a German baron, approached her, and with an air of assurance, said:</p> 
               <p>"I claim the right to dance a measure with the spirit I had power to conjure from the depths of ocean. Fair Undine, your Rudolph asks a single waltz to show these people how gods and sylphides illustrate the poetry of motion."</p> 
               <p>"My hand is already promised for the first waltz," she replied, "and, moreover, Bertalda has rivalled me. Seek her, and offer her the honor you would extend to me."</p> 
               <p>"Ha! jealous little sprite! Bertalda! what is that form of mere clay to me, while you are a dream, a sea-nymph, clad in spray, a pearl gathered from the halls of Neptune. Come, and tell me of your coral home deep in the unsunned caverns of ocean, child of the foamy sparkling element from which you sprang. Let us join the waltz together; float with me through its mazes but a single round, and then I resign you to your fortunate cavalier."</p> 
               <p>Lucille still clung to the arm of Vivaldi, but Senora Baliera whispered in his ear:</p> 
               <p>"It is our honored guest, the young duke. He has the power and the will to serve you; permit Lucille to go with him, as he particularly wishes it."</p> 
                
               <p>Though bewildered by this singular assurance that a stranger was interested in his affairs, Vivaldi knew the advantage so powerful a friend must be to him, and after a brief moment of hesitation, he released the little hand from his arm, and bowing, said:</p> 
               <p>"For a brief season I resign my claims in favor of the noble Rudolph."</p> 
               <p>Lucille looked surprised, almost offended, at this transfer, but a few low-toned words from Vivaldi reassured her.</p> 
               <p>"Senora Baliera wishes you to give the first waltz to her husband's friend. The duke, as a stranger, is entitled to this courtesy."</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray listened eagerly, and caught the sense of his words. A smile of exultation swept across her features, and she exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Of course: go, my child, and enjoy the amusement you love so much. If this noble cavalier waltzes as well as you do, your performance will be worth looking at."</p> 
               <p>"I should shame both my own and my assumed fatherland, if I did not excel in this particular dance," replied Evoli, with his usual nonchalance; and Lucille, without any volition of her own, found herself whirling away to the sound of the bounding music, to which her twinkling feet instinctively kept time. She soon found that her partner was indeed a perfect waltzer, for never before had her light form been so perfectly sustained-never had she so floated on the wings of melody as now; she seemed scarcely to touch the floor; and groups gathered to see the water sprite and her cavalier perform their airy evolutions with a grace seldom equalled.</p> 
               <p>At length they passed near the door of a boudoir which joined the saloon. It was a small room, illuminated by a single lamp, to which a ground glass shade gave the effect of moonlight. Evoli placed his partner on a divan near an<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6335-00000160"/> open window, and brought her an ice from the refreshment-room. He placed himself opposite to her, and lightly said:</p> 
               <p>"It is really too warm to waltz long. I was afraid, if I kept you upon the floor, that you might return to your original element, and flow a peerless rill to seas unknown. If I could have shared your fate, and, thus united, we could have flowed down time's river, I might have risked such a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dnouement;</foreign> but, alas! I have too much of earth about me to embrace a destiny so blessed."</p> 
               <p>"Ah! that waltz was entrancing! I am not at all fatigued, Senor, thanks to the power and skill you displayed as we flew through its mazes. Do not fancy that I am in danger of sharing Undine's fate. I am quite ready for another waltz when Senor Vivaldi comes to claim me."</p> 
               <p>"Really, your love of dancing must be insatiable; or does the charm of the next one lie in the person who will claim it?"</p> 
               <p>At this inquiry Lucille drew back with an air of reserve, which Evoli immediately understood. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me-I but assumed the freedom of the masquerade to utter my thoughts as they arise. Protected by my assumed character, I still wish to say something to you which you may consider strange, but my motives are atleast good; for the welfare of yourself, and, may I say it, Mademoiselle, of your lover, is not indifferent to me."</p> 
               <p>Lucille blushed, looked distressed and perplexed; but she said nothing, and her companion rapidly went on:</p> 
               <p>"An agent has been sent hither from the husband of Senor Vivaldi's cousin, to propose a compromise with regard to the fortune in dispute between them. Use your influence to keep him clear of any entanglement in that quarter, and an equivalent for enough of this estate to render him independent, shall surely be secured to him. More I cannot say; but Senora Baliera will tell you that I redeem all the pledges I make. There, I see that you are quite rested, Mademoiselle. Shall we resume our waltz?"</p> 
               <p>He offered his hand, which Lucille accepted in a state of bewildered surprise. As they emerged from the door, he whispered:</p> 
               <p>"You pledge me your aid?"</p> 
               <p>She looked up, caught the gleam of his magnetic eye beneath his mask, and bowed her head in assent. The next moment they were whirling among the dancers, and when they reached the spot on which they had left her mother and Vivaldi, Evoli led her back to their protection. With a graceful bow, he said:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Madame, for the honor of your daughter's hand in this intoxicating dance. Senor, I owe you something for the courtesy which led you to waive your right in favor of a stranger. I always pay my debts, and I shall eagerly avail myself of the first opportunity to cancel this one."</p> 
               <p>He bowed, and before Vivaldi could reply, was lost amid the crowd. Lucille was impatient to reveal to her lover the singular confidence offered her by her late partner, but no opportunity offered for so doing, for among so many people she feared her communication might be overheard; and soon she became so occupied with the amusements of the evening, that, for a season, it passed from her memory. As she left the supper-room, it was recalled by a voice that whispered in her ear, "Remember!" in tones she recognized as the same which had addressed her in the boudoir, but on looking around, she saw no one save a friar in a sombre frock, with his cowl closely drawn over his face. He offered a folded paper to Vivaldi, and disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Lucille earnestly whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Read it, Francesco. Its contents may have more significance than you think."</p> 
               <p>Thus urged, Vivaldi availed himself of the first opportunity<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6335-00000161"/> tunity to glance over the lines so mysteriously presented to him. He read:</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"SENOR:-I have come to this ball chiefly to secure a brief interview with you. Meet me half an hour hence in the lime-tree walk leading to the grotto, as I have that to say which may materially affect your fortunes."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Lucille looked over the paper at the same time, and she said:</p> 
               <p>"I also have something to tell you, which will convince you that the manuvres of the duke to waltz with me tonight, were simply to obtain a few moments' conversation with reference to your affairs."</p> 
               <p>She then related what had passed between them, and added:</p> 
               <p>"The friar and the duke are one, I am sure. I cannot fathom the source of his interest in our fortunes, but he is certainly connected with them in some manner that we do not comprehend."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi reflected a few moments, and then seriously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Are you willing, Lucille, that I shall accept the offer this stranger has made, and give up my chances for wealth? For myself, a certainty which will enable me to gain your hand at once, would be preferred to a claim which may end in nothing."</p> 
               <p>"I am not mercenary, and I love you," whispered the young girl, with a charming smile, and a deepening blush upon her transparent cheek.</p> 
               <p>"I am answered," replied Vivaldi, with a vibration in his voice which made her heart beat with a new sense of happiness in the strong manly love of which she felt she was the object.</p> 
                
               <p>Vivaldi sought Madame Villeray, and placing Lucille in her care, at the expiration of the time named in the note, proceeded toward the place of meeting. Groups were promenading through the grounds, for the night was deliciously clear and soft, even for that climate, and a few had found their way to the shrine of the seeress; but now the lime-tree walk was nearly deserted. A single dark figure paced to and fro beneath its shadows, evidently awaiting the arrival of some one, and as Vivaldi approached, the friar advanced to meet him. The young man said:</p> 
               <p>"I am here at your bidding. What is your object in drawing me hither?"</p> 
               <p>"To serve you," was the prompt response. "I am the agent sent hither to propose to you what I have since learned is an impossibility-the division of the inheritance to which you are the legal heir, if the Countess Ernesti refuses the offers of her family. Am I not right, Senor?"</p> 
               <p>"Perfectly; the estate cannot be divided. You are, then, a friend of the outlaw to whom my cousin has given her hand?"</p> 
               <p>"I am; but I am powerless to save him from the doom that hangs over him. The Vendetta has already written his fate in characters of blood; the decree may not be carried out quite yet, but it will surely be accomplished before the expiration of the year named by Tomaso Vivaldi, and the countess will be restored to her birthright."</p> 
               <p>"What, then, is your object in seeking me?"</p> 
               <p>"To offer you something like an equivalent for what you resign. Move no further in this affair, and I pledge the honor of a noble house to further your interests in your profession, and also to guarantee your future fortune. You may expect rapid promotion; and when the young countess bestows her hand on one who is her equal in rank and fortune, a liberal annuity will be settled upon you."</p> 
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6335-00000162"/> 
               <p>"What guarantee have I that these promises will be performed?"</p> 
               <p>"Here is a written paper, signed by a name that has never been dishonored by non-compliance with its contracts. I offer you immediate independence, with the power to claim your betrothed bride. If you cling to the hope of winning the inheritance, you will lose all; for I am certain that within the allotted time, the daughter of Count Ernesti will be the acknowledged mistress of her ancestral home."</p> 
               <p>"Since the discovery of this young girl, I have not permitted myself to hope that I shall claim my uncle's fortune. I accept your offers, my lord, for I penetrate your disguise. Your name is attached to this paper, and yours, I presume, is the hand destined for my cousin. I trust that no treachery against Falcone is concealed beneath this offer."</p> 
               <p>"Treachery! Why should you suspect it? His fate will only be one more story of Corsican vengeance carried to its extreme limits. To secure his bride, life was taken, and the relatives of the murdered man will only carry out the traditions of their race."</p> 
               <p>"But can he not be warned? You are his friend-you are aware of the fate that threatens him."</p> 
               <p>"And so also is he," replied Evoli, calmly. "Falcone may possibly evade the doom that approaches him, but his life will not ensure the estate to you, for his bride will not have firmness to refuse the brilliant future that is offered her. Count Ernesti has already applied to the Pope for a dissolution of his daughter's marriage; it will be granted, and the outlawed husband, even if he is permitted to live, will be forsaken. I speak what I know, Senor Vivaldi."</p> 
               <p>"Yet you, who probably expect to win her, claim to be his friend."</p> 
               <p>"I was his friend, but now-Senor, I cannot explain our present relations. I should rather say that Falcone and I have been friends-now we are-"</p> 
               <p>He paused, and Vivaldi added:</p> 
               <p>"Are rivals. I comprehend, my lord. My cousin must decide her own fate; 'tis not for me to interfere in any way, when I should gain so much by her allegiance to her wedded vows."</p> 
               <p>"Then you will accept my terms?"</p> 
               <p>"I do accept them."</p> 
               <p>"That is well; examine the paper I have given you, and see that it is fairly executed."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi, in a strange whirl of feeling, drew near a lamp, and looked over the closely-written page Evoli had given him. He presently turned to address him, but he had disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Walking like one in a dream, he slowly paced the long avenue in deep thought, and then proceeded toward the grotto to inquire how Marie had passed the hours of his absence. In the meantime, a tall, masked figure, wearing the costume of a Turkish pacha, appeared in front of the sibyl's shrine, and after a few courteous words of greeting, his long, slender hand, flashing with jewels, sought among the polished bones in Marie's vase for one from which to have his future foretold.</p> 
               <p>There was a strange fluttering emotion visible in the face and person of the seeress, as she fixed her large, melancholy eyes upon her visitor, with an expression half of feat, half of defiance, and she tremulously asked:</p> 
               <p>"Why have you come to <emph>me</emph> to foretell that future which you are certain you hold within your own grasp? It is a mockery! a mockery!"</p> 
               <p>The Turk lightly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It may be so, fair oracle; but it is still my pleasure to have my bright fortunes foretold by a real Corsican witch.<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6335-00000163"/> Excuse me, but the woman of Endor was beautiful and young, yet the chronicle calls her by that name. Ah, here is a bone as polished as fashionable sarcasm, which will answer my turn. Read its mystic lines, and tell me if my hopes will blossom and bear fruit, or will they be nipped in the bud?"</p> 
               <p>Marie, with trembling hands and dilated eyes, seized the bone, and glanced over its surface with intense interest. The faint network of lines traced upon it seemed to impress her vividly. She slowly followed them with her finger, and the impatient applicant again spoke:</p> 
               <p>"Let me hear the decree of fate. Am I to be happy or miserable? success or failure? which awaits me?"</p> 
               <p>Marie looked up, and faintly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Both; success in meditated treachery-failure in the reward. In the moment of fruition, the cherished hope of your heart will be crushed. There is blood-blood-but the record is blurred-I cannot read it clearly."</p> 
               <p>"Neither can you read it at all," replied the Turk, with haughty composure. "I have no faith in your predictions; I merely used them as a pretext to see you in private."</p> 
               <p>"Then I am not mistaken. You are Senor Benedetto. When did you leave the cavern and how are its inmates?"</p> 
               <p>"I left them a few hours after your own departure, and I am bearer of a message from Clarice to her friend."</p> 
               <p>"Which is to bid me return to her as soon as possible."</p> 
               <p>"On the contrary, it is to inform you that Lisa's daughter, Gulietta, will come to her for a season, and until she summons you to return, you can remain with your friends in Bastia."</p> 
               <p>"What then has brought you hither?"</p> 
               <p>"The wish to serve Guilio; but my mission has failed. I go hence to Italy, as my sentence of exile is revoked."</p> 
               <p>Marie uttered a cry of joy.</p> 
                
               <p>"That is well, Senor Benedetto. You will go at once; you will not return to the cavern; you will leave my poor Clarice to the love in which she will find happiness. I have read you wrongfully-I beg that you will pardon me."</p> 
               <p>"That is easily done, good Marie, for I never bear malice. If the heart of your friend clings to her husband, I am sure I shall make no attempt to wrest her from him."</p> 
               <p>"You promise me this?" exclaimed Marie, eagerly. "You will go back to your own country, and leave the mountain eagle with his dove clasped to his breast."</p> 
               <p>Evoli laughed at this image; it was a laugh that made her heart stand still, for it was bitter and scornful, but he lightly said:</p> 
               <p>"An eagle's nest, with a dove for its inmate, would be a curious spectacle for an ornithologist. Do you not know that the lordly bird would soon rend his timid companion into fragments?"</p> 
               <p>"My image may have been false, Senor," replied Marie, gravely; "but I warn you of one thing: If my eagle suspects his mate of a desire to wing her flight from his side, he <emph>will</emph> rend her. A Corsican slays his wife if she proves faithless."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I know they are a tragic race," he mockingly responded. "Yet have no fears for your fair friend, for I swear to you her safety shall not be compromised by me."</p> 
               <p>"You pledge your honor to this?" she earnestly asked.</p> 
               <p>"Aye, be at ease with your friends here. Gulietta is young and bright; and she will prove a pleasant companion for a gay young girl like Clarice. When she needs your presence, she will duly warn you. Adieu, fair prophetess. I hope your next applicant will have better fortunes to foretell than you have vouchsafed to me."</p> 
               <p>A step was heard approaching, and as it drew near, Evoli disappeared in the opposite direction. Marie looked after<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6335-00000164"/> him with an expression of vague fear and distrust, but her face brightened at the sound of a familiar voice, and with a sigh of relief she turned to greet Vivaldi.</p> 
               <p>"Have you had many inquiries at the shrine of fate?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes; many of the gay butterflies of fashion have been attracted hither; but the sombre tone of my predictions disgusted the most of them. Yes, to-night everything has seemed clouded to me with storms and darkness. I can see nothing bright, and a dim oppression has fallen on my own spirit."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, you only describe the feelings of a sensitive person placed in a discordant atmosphere. The sounds of mirth strike with hollow dissonance upon the heart that is not in unison with them. We had done better to leave you to a quiet evening with M. Villeray."</p> 
               <p>"No-it was necessary that I should come hither. I have accomplished my mission by so doing, and now I am ready to go."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi regarded her intently, but as he possessed no clue to the meaning of her words, he said:</p> 
               <p>"The sparkle and zest of the entertainment are over. I will seek Madame Villeray, and see if she is ready to return home."</p> 
               <p>"You will not have your future revealed, then?"</p> 
               <p>"No-I lack faith, and, besides, your bones have probably all been used by others; how, then, can one do duty for my especial fate? I do not care to have my bright visions dispelled by predictions of evil, for in the mingled woof of life I cannot expect the golden threads to weave themselves exclusively for me."</p> 
               <p>"It is as well, perhaps. Enjoy the sunshine while it lasts, and shelter yourself from the storm of fate as best you may."</p> 
                
               <p>"That is true philosophy, Senora, and I shall act on your advice. Come with me to the end of the lime tree walk, and I will bring our party there to join you."</p> 
               <p>Together they descended the pathway, and leaving Marie on a rustic seat, Vivaldi again entered the ball-room. Madame Villeray was looking anxiously for him, for she was desirous of being the first to leave the scene of the revels. The young duke had disappeared, and losing the hope that her daughter might secure so brilliant a conquest, all interest in the scene departed. Their adieux were soon made, and the four were whirled away toward the villa, the hearts of at least two of them filled with happy dreams of the future. Before they parted Vivaldi found means to whisper in the ear of his betrothed:</p> 
               <p>"You are mine, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">cara mia.</foreign> To-morrow I will see your father, and settle the day that will make me the happiest of men."</p> 
               <p>The sudden flush of joy, the tremor that ran through the little hand he held, assured him that she, too, was happy in the prospect of release from the thraldom in which she had lately been held.</p> 
               <p>Madame Villeray glanced at her face as they entered the hall, and peevishly said:</p> 
               <p>"One would think you had just returned from Heaven, Lucille, in place of a stupid ball. After all Senor Baliera's preparations, the affair was a failure."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">maman,</foreign> how can you say so? I think it was charming. Nothing could have been in better taste."</p> 
               <p>"So <emph>you</emph> may think, you have never seen anything more magnificent," replied the elder lady superciliously, "but after my experience, it seemed flat and tame. And only to think! you had the chance to fascinate a duke, and did not profit by it."</p> 
               <p>Lucille laughed, but she checked the reply that arose to<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6335-00000165"/> her lips, and carried with her into the solitude of her own room the perfect content with her opening future which filled every pulse of her beating heart.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DEADLY JEALOUSY. ITS FATAL ACTION.</head> 
               <p>A FEW few hours after the departure of Evoli, Lisa sought an interview with her foster-son, and informed him of her wish to have her daughter with her for a season. Guilio seemed pleased with the proposal, and promptly said:</p> 
               <p>"It is exactly what I wish myself. My own presence is absolutely necessary on my lugger, and I cannot leave Clarice without some companionship. My mate does not manage the bark well, for he has been very nearly captured with a valuable cargo on board."</p> 
               <p>"That would have been bad; but does the young Senora know that-that you are a smuggler?"</p> 
               <p>He changed color, and then abruptly said:</p> 
               <p>"She does not; neither do I wish her to discover it."</p> 
               <p>"Then how does she suppose you provide all the fine things that are about her? Outlaws don't usually have the means to buy silks and laces, not to mention other extravagant doings."</p> 
               <p>Guilio here looked almost angry; he imperiously replied:</p> 
               <p>"My expenses or those of my wife are no business of yours, Lisa. I see that you do not like Clarice; but I warn you not to betray to her the source of the luxury that surrounds her. She does not reason about it, for she is too young and ignorant of life to take thought of such things. It is my pleasure to lavish upon her all I possess, and no one shall say me nay. Let Gulietta come as speedily as possible, for I must leave the cavern in two days, to be absent probably as many weeks."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you for the permission to have my child with me, though it was ungraciously accorded. Oh, Guilio, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mio,</foreign> you have forgotten the days of your childhood. In your devotion to your new idol you throw aside all consideration for others."</p> 
               <p>"You accuse me unjustly," replied Guilio," with deepening color, for he felt that her words were true. "I love you, and trust you. I remember all your care of me during my childhood, and I have shown that I did not forget it by aiding you as soon as it was in my power to do so. But from the day I brought my bride hither you have shown that you dislike her; why, I know not, nor do I care to know. Her sweetness, her beauty, have failed to conciliate you; you reproach me with ingratitude, yet it is you who are ungrateful when you repulse the advances of the loveliest creature under the sun."</p> 
               <p>Lisa coldly replied:</p> 
               <p>"I am aware that such is your estimate of her, therefore I cannot be expected to share it. The heart of the child I nursed as my own has gone after a strange woman, and has closed itself to me. It is natural, perhaps, but it is hard to bear."</p> 
               <p>A few tears fell from the fiery black eyes, and Guilio felt almost self-condemned. He more tenderly said:</p> 
               <p>"Pardon me, Lisa, if I have unconsciously wounded you. I adore my wife; we are in the first bloom of our passion, and I have naturally been much occupied with her; but I also have a strong attachment for you. I love Guiletta as a sister, and when she comes, perhaps through her, we shall all learn to understand each other better."</p> 
               <p>"The sooner she comes the better then," returned Lisa, gloomily.</p> 
               <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6335-00000166"/> 
               <p>"Yes, by all means; I will inform Clarice of her expected arrival, and prepare her to regard her as a sister."</p> 
               <p>He turned away, and reentered the passage leading to his own apartments, and as the woman listened to his retreating steps, her dark eyes lighted up with a vindictive gleam. Muttered words of ominous import burst from her lips while she arranged the cheeses she was preparing for Angelo to take to market in the valley. On his return on the following evening he was to bring Gulietta with him, and with a kind of fierce joy the mother anticipated her arrival.</p> 
               <p>Clarice learned with dismay that Guilio must leave her for a season, and when she was convinced that it must be so, she gladly welcomed the prospect of a companion suited to her in age during the tedious days of his absence.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta arrived the next day, and after a brief and impressive interview with her mother, she was conducted to the presence of the young wife. She was a few years older than Clarice, and the tall, lithe figure, blooming cheeks, and starry eyes of the girl, with her abundance of raven hair, gave one the idea of a gipsy queen. Her manner was as stately as her person, and her voice was clear, hard and metallic. The voice is often a key to the character, and that of this grand specimen of mere flesh and blood beauty did not belie the nature that lay folded within her.</p> 
               <p>Two flowers might have typified these women, thus brought in deadly rivalry with each other; Clarice as the stately lily, with its white and delicate petals withering beneath a rude touch, and Gulietta as the Virginia creeper, with its poisonous wealth of scarlet blossoms. The refined beauty of her rival awakened a pang of envious jealousy in the heart of Gulietta, and as she compared her own style with the delicate loveliness of Clarice, she marvelled if Guilio could ever be brought to console himself for her loss, with a being so different in every respect as herself.</p> 
                
               <p>He should, he must, was her resolve; love such as she felt for him could achieve more than this, and the heart that had wandered from her should yet own the power of her charms. Yet all this was concealed beneath an appearance of interest and affection for the wife of her early playmate.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta played her part so well that Guilio who watched her with keen eyes during the week he remained after her arrival, was satisfied that the affection she felt for himself was only that of a tender sister. Once he feared it might have been otherwise, but now he felt reassured. In her convent Gulietta had acquired accomplishments not often bestowed on persons of her class, and Clarice found in her a companion suited to her taste. It was speedily arranged between them that in the weeks of Guilio's absence they were to spend a portion of every day in the cultivation of music, and in reading together such books as Gulietta had brought with her from the convent.</p> 
               <p>Hitherto almost shut out from the treasures of literature, with the vague longings of genius, and aspirations after the beautiful in art and nature, Clarice eagerly grasped at any means of improvement that came within her reach; Gulietta promised all the assistance it was in her power to bestow, and the former expressed her thanks so warmly and gracefully as almost to touch the heart filled with baleful enmity toward her.</p> 
               <p>At the moment of departure, Guilio reiterated his charges to Lisa and her daughter to take the best care of his precious darling; he extricated himself from the clinging arms of his bride, tore himself away with the promise to return as speedily as possible. Clarice retired to indulge her sorrow alone, and the two women remained together.</p> 
               <p>Their eyes met, and the mother asked:</p> 
               <p>"Have you the nerve to carry out my plan?"</p> 
               <p>"Why not trust to this Benedetto of whom you have told<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6335-00000167"/> me?" replied the daughter, evasively. "He will remove her from my path without the necessity of crime."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, but the safety of Guilio will be risked in carrying her off, as long as <emph>she</emph> lives, there will danger that her existence may become known to him. Believe me, Gulietta, when I tell you that no other woman can be anything to him till this one is cold in death."</p> 
               <p>A savage gleam shot from the eyes of the girl, and she hissed through her half closed teeth:</p> 
               <p>"To think that such a pale-faced thing as that should have stepped between me and the one hope of my life! Guilio knew that I loved him; he has known it from our childhood, and he should have understood my nature better than to have dared to give me a rival. Yes, I will do it; I will blacken my soul with crime to gain him. Give me the deadly extract you have prepared, and I will use it so deftly she shall never know what hurt her."</p> 
               <p>Her mother gazed fixedly upon her a few seconds, and then drew from her bosom a small vial filled with a murky-looking liquid. She whispered:</p> 
               <p>"It is the life of the laurel, unskilfully extracted, but certain in its effect. When Guilio returns, it must be to find his dainty darling in her grave. It is the only safety for him, the only hope for you."</p> 
               <p>Gulietta took the vial, held it up to the light, and shook its contents. A strange smile quivered on her lips as she said:</p> 
               <p>"We are curious creatures. To think that the living consciousness can be blotted out by a few drops of this innocent looking fluid, the blood be frozen at its fount, the heart robbed of its pulsations. Yet-yet it is a fearful thing to do."</p> 
               <p>"Have you grown cowardly in your convent?" asked Lisa, disdainfully. "Is it not better that she should perish in the flush of her youth and happiness, before blight has fallen upon her, than that you shall live a hopeless, disappointed woman? Choose between the two."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>have</emph> chosen," replied Gulietta, with a fierce gesture, as she concealed the vial about her person. "This fair piece of pride and impertinence shall not trouble you much longer, mother. But what shall we say to Benedetto, when he returns to find her in her shroud?"</p> 
               <p>"I shall tell him that confinement in the cavern brought on a violent fever, which proved fatal in a few hours. There will be nothing to disprove my statement, for in this climate such things are of too frequent occurrence to cause suspicion of my truth."</p> 
               <p>"But if he should suspect?"</p> 
               <p>"Then he may think what he pleases. Thank Heaven! we are above the reach of the law in our stronghold, so what matters it if we are at war with all below us? Guilio is an outlaw, with vendetta declared against him, incurred for the sake of this pretty doll; why, then, shall she who wishes to assume her place shrink also from the ban of society?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not; to win him, I am ready to dare everything," replied Gulietta, with an expression of concentrated purpose which assured her mother that there was no shrinking in her nature. She looked the meditated crime firmly in the face, and her heart did not quail before it.</p> 
               <p>With a smile of triumph, Lisa said:</p> 
               <p>"You are a true Corsican; fiery as the lava which rushes seething from the crater's mouth, fearless as the steel that flashes in the front of the battle, I recognize in you blood of my blood. Make your own fate, my daughter; let no relenting turn you aside from the bright future that opens before you, and you shall yet be Queen of the Mountain."</p> 
               <p>The girl's cheeks flushed, her lips parted, and a savage<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6335-00000168"/> gleam of joy illuminated the dusky depths of her eyes as she whispered:</p> 
               <p>"And the beloved of Guilio's heart; that is my crown, for the diadem of an empress would be worthless in comparison with that hope."</p> 
               <p>"Cherish it, then, for it shall meet fruition."</p> 
               <p>Lisa turned away, and busied herself with her ordinary occupations as quietly as if nothing unusual had occurred. It was not thus with Gulietta. She paced the vast length of the cavern with the swiftness of a caged leopardess, brooding over the fatal power of life and death that rested in her keeping, and lashing herself into a kind of blind, jealous fury, against the innocent cause of her suffering.</p> 
               <p>Clarice once out of her way, she felt assured that, in his great anguish at her loss, Guilio must turn to her for consolation. Gradually she would win her way to his heart, till she had made him her own forever. <emph>Forever!</emph> she shuddered as she recalled the teachings she had so vainly received.</p> 
               <p>"No murderer shall ever enter the kingdom of Heaven." Bah! why should she fear that sentence? Away with doubt; action, action was now the only surety for the future. Before the return of Benedetto, the deed must be accomplished, or it would be too late.</p> 
               <p>She smoothed her brow, decked her lips in smiles, and went to join her intended victim. She found Clarice preparing to go out on the platform which looked toward the sea, in the hope that she should catch a glimpse of Guilio's lugger, as she flitted past their eyrie. Gulietta accompanied her, and remained until the vessel appeared, and a signal agreed on between the lovers was hoisted, to point out her identity to the eyes her commander knew would be watching for its appearance. Clarice waved her handkerchief in reply, and again wept bitterly.</p> 
                
               <p>Gulietta used her utmost efforts to console her, but she soon wearied of the task, and left her to the indulgence of her sorrow, under the pretext of assisting her mother in her domestic duties.</p> 
               <p>When twilight fell, she summoned Clarice to their frugal supper of <foreign xml:lang="ITA">broccio</foreign> and cream. She came in reluctantly, and scarcely tasted the food set before her; but there was a bottle of wine upon the table, from which her companion insisted she should drink. It was the vintage of her own convent, and had been made by the nuns. Gulietta had brought a dozen bottles with her, as a present to her foster-brother, and Clarice must pronounce upon its merits. Not caring to appear churlish, she languidly complied with the urgent entreaties addressed to her; but, after sipping a few drops from the glass offered to her, she said:</p> 
               <p>"It has a singular, bitter taste; something like the petals of the wild flowers I have sometimes chewed. I like our own red wine best."</p> 
               <p>"That is because you scarcely taste it. Pray do honor to our nectar by drinking at least half the glass I poured for you. If you do not, I shall think my humble offering scorned."</p> 
               <p>If Clarice had looked up, and beheld her paling cheek, her wild eyes glittering with fearful excitement, she would instinctively have dropped the fatal draught; but she did not-she wearily said, as she lifted it to her lips:</p> 
               <p>"I cannot now refuse to drink it, Guiletta. Perhaps it will make me sleep soundly, and take this dreary pain from my heart."</p> 
               <p>"Aye, Senora, it will surely do that. Never have you slept so deeply, or so sweetly, as the slumber this draught will produce. It is a matchless sedative."</p> 
               <p>Clarice drank half the wine, and replaced the glass suddenly; she murmured:</p> 
               <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6335-00000169"/> 
               <p>"It affects me strangely. My head is giddy, and everything begins to glimmer before me. What is it? Oh, am I dying, and my Guilio away!"</p> 
               <p>She attempted to rise, but fell back upon her seat insensible. Trembling with excitement, Gulietta approached her, felt her pulse, and passed her hands over her lips; the breath of life still issued from them in fitful gasps, and she muttered:</p> 
               <p>"Stupid fool! why did she not drink the whole, and end the tragedy at once? I wonder if I can force enough between her lips to destroy her without delay, for in this condition she may lie for hours fluttering between life and death."</p> 
               <p>Lisa, who had been on the watch, here entered, pale as a phantom, looking the very embodiment of terror. She hurriedly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Is she really dead?"</p> 
               <p>"Not quite; her dainty palate did not relish the wine, and I could not persuade her to drink enough to strike her down as with a stroke of lightning. See!"</p> 
               <p>Lisa wrung her hands in terror.</p> 
               <p>"What shall we do! what shall we do! Angelo has come, and he says Senor Benedetto will be here in another hour. He met him at the cove, and he would have been here before now, but for his care about a box he brought with him. He would not come on till he had provided the means of getting it safely here."</p> 
               <p>"Do!" repeated the girl, fiercely. "Just what we would have done if he had come later. Show him the corpse of his dainty lady."</p> 
               <p>"But she is not dead; she may not die. He is keen as Saladin's cimeter; he will comprehend what we have attempted, and if he cannot restore her, he will punish us direfully."</p> 
                
               <p>The girl turned on her fiercely.</p> 
               <p>"You have your story prepared; tell it to him, if it will serve you at all, it will serve you now."</p> 
               <p>"No, no; if she were really dead, the odor of the poison would soon leave her; but when he comes he will be able to detect it on her breath. In place of letting her die, our only hope of safety lies in keeping life in her."</p> 
               <p>"And lose the reward of our crime? Never! let her die!"</p> 
               <p>"But I tell you this fearful man will ruin us. He will reveal all to my husband-to Guilio. Oh, is there no antidote to this poison?"</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless there is one, but we have it not. I thought you had nerve for anything, but you seem scared out of your wits."</p> 
               <p>There was deep contempt in her tones, and her mother sharply retorted:</p> 
               <p>"If you knew the man that is coming, you would be frightened, too. He would no more mind crushing you and me, than if we were a couple of weeds upon his path. He has power, will and recklessness, then why shall I not fear him?"</p> 
               <p>"You should have thought of all this before you undertook to circumvent him. I will meet this formidable Benedetto, and bear the brunt of his anger, since you shrink from doing so."</p> 
               <p>"Wait till you see him, and then utter your bravado if you dare. Come, help me lift this girl and put her in bed; if he found her here, and thus, he would destroy us both."</p> 
               <p>Between them they lifted Clarice, and carried her to her couch. Gulietta loosened her clothes, and wrapped her in a dressing-robe; she then sought for some pungent essence upon her toilet, and her lip curled with fierce scorn as she<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6335-00000170"/> saw the many little elegant trifles scattered about it. She bathed the face of the insensible girl with rose-water, with the hope that its perfume would overpower the subtle odor of the potion she had swallowed; but when she bent down at intervals to see if respiration yet continued, the sickening taint of the laurel water came with each labored sigh that issued from the oppressed breast of that pale and silent form.</p> 
               <p>Lisa chafed her hands, covered her with blankets, and used every effort to restore the languid circulation before the arrival of the dreaded Benedetto. An hour, that seemed to the two women an eternity, thus passed away; another was slipping by, and they began to hope that he would not reach the cavern that night, when the sound of approaching voices were heard.</p> 
               <p>Evoli and Angelo, gaily talking, were coming through the chapel, and how to account to them for the strange scene that awaited them, was the thought uppermost with both the women. Angelo, they knew, was honest and open as the day, and the deadly treachery they had almost accomplished would be to him a terrible revelation, if comprehended in its full extent.</p> 
               <p>As they drew near, Lisa summoned courage to go and meet them. Her pallid face and disordered appearance struck her husband, and he hurriedly asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has anything happened to the senora? Why do you look so wild, Lisa?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear, that I should live to see this hour. The poor child lies insensible, stricken down like a broken flower by a sudden and incomprehensible attack which came on her at supper. Oh! I am afraid she will never unclose her sweet eyes again."</p> 
               <p>Evoli glared on her one instant, and the poor actor felt as if the secrets of her soul were laid bare before that glance.</p> 
                
               <p>He made no reply, but dropping the box which he and Angelo were carrying between them, rushed like a madman to the side of Clarice.</p> 
               <p>The death-like immobility of her form filled him with nameless terror; he wildly passed his hands over her face, clasped her chilling hands, and bent down to ascertain if she yet breathed. As he raised his head again he glanced at Gulietta; it was but a single flash of his eyes, but it took in her shrinking form, her half defiant, half terrified expression, and he comprehended the dire meaning of the scene before him. He merely said:</p> 
               <p>"It is not yet too late. Thank Heaven that I arrived in time to save her; aid me in this to the utmost of your ability as you value your own life."</p> 
               <p>His voice was low and concentrated, and his words only reached the ears for which they were intended, but the unscrupulous woman felt that she had met her master. There could be no trifling here, for what this man said he fully meant, and she quailed before the power she dared not resist.</p> 
               <p>With rapid movements Evoli sought a small medicine-chest, and taking from it a vial, forced a portion of its contents between the lips of the senseless Clarice. He watched its effect with intense solicitude, and at intervals repeated the dose. Gradually faint symptoms of returning life were visible; a pale rose-tint returned to her cheeks, her lips moved tremulously, and she made efforts to lift the heavy lids that vailed her eyes.</p> 
               <p>At length he arose, and said to Lisa, who had followed all his motions with that kind of fear inspired by the venomous reptile before it strikes its prey,</p> 
               <p>"The senora will live. You and your husband can retire, and your daughter and myself will watch beside her."</p> 
               <p>"If we can be of any use, we had better stay, too," said<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6335-00000171"/> Angelo, bluntly. "I would not for my right hand have Guilio come back and find his bird of beauty dead."</p> 
               <p>"I have told you she will not die. Lisa should return to her child, and you must rest before you go forth to your daily labor. Go, then, good Angelo; this young girl and myself can take every care of the senora."</p> 
               <p>Angelo was not sorry to have this assurance, for he had been wandering over the hills all day, and felt the need of sleep. His wife was glad to escape from the penetrating eye that followed all her movements, and, she felt, fathomed her to the depths of her soul. In a moment of dire temptation she had been incapable of resisting the impulses of the wild nature within her, but she felt the mute accusation of that unflinching glance with a shrinking dread that was incomprehensible to her. She submissively said:</p> 
               <p>"Since Senor Benedetto wishes it, we had better leave him to watch with Gulietta. She is young and strong, and can easily bear her share of the burden."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother; go to the child, he may wake and miss you if you stay here too long. Senor Benedetto and I can do all that is now necessary for our patient."</p> 
               <p>Thus urged, the husband and wife retired, leaving the two watchers alone. Evoli listened to the echo of their retreating steps, and when they died away in the distance he turned to the girl and surveyed her a moment without speaking. She looked up, and met the glance which she felt was upon her, but her eyes had in them no deprecation, no quailing. The fire of pride and passion burned in their depths, and her red lips quivered as if resolutely repressing the words ready to pour forth in vindication of her crime. He at length spoke, in low, ringing tones:</p> 
               <p>"In this case <emph>life</emph> has been tampered with. <emph>Yours</emph> was the hand that did it, for I recognize in you one that can act, while your mother, less firm in her wickedness, can only plan. Speak the truth-why have you attempted to destroy <emph>the wife of Guilio!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The emphasis upon the last words caused the blood to leap to her cheek, and she slowly answered:</p> 
               <p>"Because she is his wife. You knew it before; then why have you compelled me to say it?"</p> 
               <p>"Then you love him?"</p> 
               <p>She passionately replied:</p> 
               <p>"Have I not proved it in this confession which you have wrung from me, I know not how or why?"</p> 
               <p>A subtle smile played upon his lip, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"I have never yet met one who could resist my power. It was my birth-right and my best inheritance. It is the secret of a grand organization, given for good or for evil as it is wielded by its possessor. I glory in it for the sway it gives me over men, and I have not often abused it. Could not your weak mother have told you that this statue of breathing clay that lies so helplessly before us would be removed from your path without danger either to you or to her?"</p> 
               <p>"She feared for Guilio's safety; she dreads the entrance of the sbirri into our fastness. It may lead to ruin to all who dwell here."</p> 
               <p>"Therefore she would not abide by her compact. Truly, worse than an invasion of the sbirri would have happened to her had this young creature perished."</p> 
               <p>"I do not know what can be worse than ruin to all one loves."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, there are things infinitely worse. Torture, despair, death; all these would I have inflicted on both you and her if I had entered this cavern to find my idol a corpse. Strong as you may believe <emph>your</emph> love to Guilio to be, it is an idle fancy in comparison with the fiery passion Clarice has aroused in my heart. I was the friend of her husband; I<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6335-00000172"/> have broken his bread, shared the shelter of his roof; I am of that caste which prizes honor above wealth; yet all-all has been forgotten in the frenzied hope of snatching her from his arms. I can do it, I shall do it, for the life I have saved belongs of right to me. Act your part, and the outlawed chief shall remain here alone, to be consoled in time by you."</p> 
               <p>Gulietta listened with breathless eagerness; she asked:</p> 
               <p>"What shall I do to produce such a result? Remove her, and I ask no more."</p> 
               <p>"You must induce Clarice to believe that Guilio was faithless to you; that he was bound to you by every tie that should influence a man of honor. She is sensitive and proud, and many other influences will be brought to bear upon her, which will aid in the decision she herself will make to go forth with me."</p> 
               <p>"But how are you to accomplish all this, Senor? You are an exile yourself, and Clarice loves Guilio."</p> 
               <p>"My sentence of exile is revoked, and I shall return to Italy to claim my hereditary rank, which is noble. Clarice is also the daughter of an ancient race, and the heiress to great wealth. I tell you this, that you may see I have the power to perform what I promise. I shall lift your rival to a sphere so far above her present one, that Guilio would as soon think of seeking his lost love among the stars of Heaven as in my palace."</p> 
               <p>Gulietta listened to this revelation with intense interest. She bowed her head respectfully, and replied:</p> 
               <p>"I trust you, and I consent to serve you to the utmost of my power."</p> 
               <p>"That is well, but I warn you that the least deviation from the line laid down for you will be fatal to your hopes. Help me to win Clarice in my own way, and Guilio shall be yours."</p> 
                
               <p>Gulietta bent her head in assent, and again silence reigned between them. Evoli watched with intense solicitude the flickering life which struggled to regain its vital power in the delicate frame of Clarice, and with deep joy he saw that she was slowly reviving to consciousness. Aided by Gulietta, his efforts were unceasing to restore the stagnant circulation, but the gladness with which he felt the small hand he held fluttering with renewed life, was slightly dashed by the first words that escaped her lips, she murmured as one waking from a dream:</p> 
               <p>"Oh, my Guilio, clasp me close; do not-do not let me escape from you. Death is cold, cold, and its icy touch is upon me."</p> 
               <p>"You are safe," whispered Evoli. "The skeleton hand shall not grasp you yet. Oh, Clarice, look on me, and see that <emph>I</emph> have given you back to life, and not your faithless Guilio."</p> 
               <p>These words seemed to arouse her inner consciousness, for she struggled to lift her heavy eyelids, and made a vain effort to arise.</p> 
               <p>"Raise her head, and sustain it carefully," commanded Evoli. Gulietta submissively obeyed, and the pale face of Clarice rested upon her breast, and her long hair swept over her, though she almost shivered with repulsion at its touch. Evoli understood the source of her emotion, and he said:</p> 
               <p>"Be very tender with her, Senora, for the burden you bear is very precious to more hearts than one."</p> 
               <p>He bent over Clarice, and earnestly regarded her; beneath that magnetic gaze her eyes were slowly unveiled, and she looked at him with an expression of vacant surprise. She faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"I do not understand; I thought Guilio had returned. Lay me down again, and let me sleep off this languor. It clouds my brain; I can see nothing truly."</p> 
               <pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6335-00000173"/> 
               <p>"Ah, you have only seen too much!" muttered Gulietta, inaudibly, and she carefully replaced her head upon her pillow. Evoli pressed her hand to his lips again and again; she feebly attempted to draw it from his clasp, while a faint flush came upon her cheek, but a controlling power she could not resist seemed to overpower her feeble will, and she fell into a tranquil slumber with her hand still held in both his own.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE TEMPTER. A WEAK HEART.</head> 
               <p>THUS the watchers sat hour after hour, each one bringing in its passage renewed life to the being who had so nearly slipped from the shores of existence into the wide sea of eternity. Gulietta watched the face of Evoli, and a kind of remorseful joy arose in her heart that her fell purpose had been stayed in its accomplishment. Since Clarice could live, and become the light of the stranger's home, far removed from all her early ties, it was best so. It was far safer to deceive than to destroy, and she was ready to play the part assigned her with such apparent truth as must bring conviction to the mind of the confiding wife.</p> 
               <p>On the following morning Clarice awoke languid, but perfectly calm, and conscious of all that was passing around her. Evoli placed himself where she could not see him, and watched the interview between the rivals.</p> 
               <p>"I have been very ill, I believe-suddenly, strangely ill," said the soft voice which sounded as music in his ears. "What could have caused such a seizure? Have you any knowledge of sickness, Gulietta, for I was never ill in my life before."</p> 
                
               <p>"The healthiest persons are often subject to the most severe attacks," replied the girl, evasively. "For a season you were in great danger, but fortunately Senor Benedetto arrived just in time to tell us what to do for you. My mother and I were so frightened that we did not know how to aid you effectually."</p> 
               <p>"Senor Benedetto," repeated Clarice, with an accent of surprise. "I scarcely expected him to return here while Guilio is away; but since he saved my life, I must not cavil at his coming. Where is he now?"</p> 
               <p>"He watched beside you with me till you were sleeping sweetly, and then retired to obtain some rest himself."</p> 
               <p>Clarice sank back and seemed absorbed in thought; presently she said:</p> 
               <p>"You too must be tired, Gulietta. I thank both you and Senor Benedetto for your kindness, but will not tax it farther. I still feel like a tired child, and I shall soon sleep again. Lie down and rest, I entreat you."</p> 
               <p>Gulietta suffered herself to be persuaded, and after she retired Clarice lay in a half dreamy state, similar to that which is produced by the use of morphine, a crowd of undefined memories and fancies strangely mingling in her mind. She had dreamed that Guilio was beside her, clasping her hand in his, and holding her back from death during those long hours of semi-consciousness, and now she knew that another had been her saviour. To Evoli she owed her life, and deep in her soul awoke the conviction that he would claim what he had rescued from the dark oblivion of an early grave.</p> 
               <p>She already seemed to belong less to herself than to him, for he had cast over her a spell she felt herself too feeble to resist. She vainly tried to drive such fantasy away. Benedetto was the friend of her husband, and he had only sought to save her for Guilio's sake; she was nothing, could be<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6335-00000174"/> nothing to him. Then he had brought her the decision of her unknown cousin; perhaps he bore with him the power to release her from the life she felt would soon become intolerable to her if Guilio must often be absent from her.</p> 
               <p>After a few more hours of repose she felt strong enough to rise and make her toilette. Unconsciously she selected the most becoming morning robe in her possession-a rose-colored wrapper, which harmonized with the delicate fairness of her complexion. When Gulietta appeared, she was quite surprised to find Clarice already dressed, and sitting in the leafy dining hall. The girl had already taken the precaution to remove the drugged wine, and no evidence remained of the event of the preceding evening.</p> 
               <p>In reply to her congratulations, Clarice declared herself almost restored to her usual health, and desired her to inform Senor Benedetto that she was ready to receive him, and hear the news he had brought from her friend Marie.</p> 
               <p>Evoli came immediately to join her, and after she had expressed her thanks for the service he had rendered her on the previous night, Clarice proposed that they should seek the platform overlooking the sea, for she felt as if its breath would revive her enfeebled energies.</p> 
               <p>He readily assented, and together they went toward it. The manner of Evoli was punctiliously reserved, and in the interest of the tidings of which she knew he was the bearer, Clarice forgot her fancies of the morning. He placed her on a seat, in a convenient spot near the edge of the rock, and replied to her inquiries concerning Marie:</p> 
               <p>"Senora Montoni wishes to remain some time with her friends, and she was glad to hear that you will have a companion in her absence."</p> 
               <p>Clarice tried to repress her own eagerness, as she asked:</p> 
               <p>"And my cousin? what was the result of your mission? Will he divide the inheritance with me, or will he play the part of the churl, and grasp the whole?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Lieutenant Vivaldi would gladly share the estate with you, but the terms of your uncle's will forbid it. You must have all, or none."</p> 
               <p>Her cheek flushed to a vivid rose, and then an expression of pale disappointment settled upon her features. But she presently said, with forced composure:</p> 
               <p>"Then my fate is fixed. My father will not claim his daughter, and my cousin will gain the inheritance. Let us go in, Senor. The air is cooler than I thought; it chills me to the heart."</p> 
               <p>Evoli silently offered his arm to assist her over the rugged path. This was not the moment to speak of his own passion, for he felt that she would now resent it, and probably banish him from her presence. But a few more weeks with the subtle poison of suspicion working in her mind against him she had so blindingly and trustingly loved, would open the way for his insidious wiles. His hand once upon her fate, its grasp should never be loosened while life lasted.</p> 
               <p>The days that followed opened a new era in the life of Clarice. Evoli had brought with him a box of books, selected with reference to her peculiar tastes; they were works of imagination, and the passionate poetry of his own tongue was read aloud by him with that pathos and expression which imparted to it a double charm.</p> 
               <p>All the stores of his highly cultivated mind were brought into requisition to show her how far superior he was to the man on whom she had bestowed her hand. Clarice felt the captivating charm of his manner, and unconsciously compared him with Guilio to the disadvantage of the latter. She sighed as she thought the wife Evoli might choose would be elevated and refined by association with a man of such varied culture, while Guilio cared little for the lore of books, and still less for the elegance of thought and expression which would render a man distinguished in society.</p> 
               <pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6335-00000175"/> 
               <p>In short, the power of race was beginning to make itself felt in the soul of this inexperienced girl, and the innate love of the beautiful and refined which is the best inheritance of the cultivated classes, now asserted its influence in an evil moment for her fidelity to her mountain chief. She almost ceased to think of Guilio's return, for the days passed all too swiftly in this charmed intercourse of kindred minds. The mornings were spent in reading, the afternoons in the marine grotto, which often echoed with the music of Evoli's magnificent voice, and Clarice listened entranced by its melody.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta always accompanied them, and Clarice dreamed not of the insidious power that was winding its coils around her. The girl seemed deeply depressed, and Clarice often tried to draw from her the cause of her unhappiness. At length, with a passionate burst of tears, Gulietta told her that she had been deserted by her lover; that every pledge had passed between them, and then he had falsely given his hand to another.</p> 
               <p>Clarice listened with tender sympathy; she attempted to console her, but Gulietta repelled her in such a manner as caused a cold doubt to thrust itself into her mind. She suddenly asked:</p> 
               <p>"You and Guilio were reared together; you were his foster-sister, he did not seek to--"</p> 
               <p>Her voice refused to utter the words her heart dictated, for they seemed to her to be a cruel wrong toward her absent husband.</p> 
               <p>"What have I done! what have I said!" exclaimed Gulietta, breaking from her. "Oh, Clarice, forgive me! I should never have spoken of my wrongs to you, but they have been bitter, bitter, and hard to bear!"</p> 
               <p>Clarice stood an instant pale as if stricken into stone. When she recovered voice to speak, she quietly said:</p> 
                
               <p>"If this is so, you should not have come here. I believed you were his sister in affection when he proposed that you should come to me."</p> 
               <p>"Till I saw him again, I thought I had conquered myself. Then-the unforgotten past rose up before me. Forgive me; this revelation was not for you to hear, but you have surprised it from me."</p> 
               <p>"Forget that it has been made," replied Clarice, with glittering eyes, and an expression of wounded pride which Gulietta was quick to interpret; and she secretly exulted in the success of her nefarious scheme.</p> 
               <p>The thought uppermost in the mind of Clarice was the great sacrifice she had been willing to make for the husband of her choice. Everything her heart most eagerly coveted-that her very temperament rendered almost necessary to her happiness-she had relinquished to remain with him, and he was the perjured lover of another woman! It was a fatal blow, brooded over in silence till it sunk into the depths of her soul, and rankled there.</p> 
               <p>Why should she persist in her refusal of her father's offers, for the sake of a man who had acted thus? Could she not forget their brief dream of love, and find happiness in such pursuits as were most congenial with her nature, while he returned to his first allegiance. She began dimly to comprehend that she was not fitted for the life she must live upon this isolated rock, cut off from nearly all communion with the outside world. Evoli had told her that he must soon return to Italy, and she thought, with a shudder, that his departure would snap the only link that bound her to the father she had abjured; the brilliant destiny that might have been hers; for with the intuition of her sex she divined that Evoli loved her; that he was far superior in rank to his present associates, and had she been free, she might have shared his greatness.</p> 
               <pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6335-00000176"/> 
               <p>Ah! why had they not met before the inexorable fate which now separated them had been embraced? then she would never have marred her future by wedding Guilio, for her heart would have sprung at once to meet its true master. She would start from these thoughts as if stung by some venomous reptile, and look up to meet the deep eyes of her tempter fixed upon her with such thrilling power as made her half believe in the stories of the evil eye. She sometimes even confusedly thought that his will forced these traitorous regrets into her mind, for in his presence they recurred again and again, while in solitude, her faith returned to her absent husband, and she wished he would come back, and save her from even a dream of treachery to the vows she had so lately plighted.</p> 
               <p>Then Guilio's supposed treachery to Gulietta arose before her, and her heart was torn in the conflict of feeling that ensued. At moments she struggled fiercely to escape from the net that was narrowing around her, and her cheek grew daily more delicate, her eyes lost their soft charm, and were alternately fierce with the fires of jealousy, or glittering with excitement over the vision of the new and untried world she might enter under such brilliant auspices, if it were only her will to do so. Evoli gave her clearly to understand that her own consent once given, he could restore her to her birthright without danger to herself or Guilio, but she must give up her husband.</p> 
               <p>Six weeks elapsed before Guilio returned. He had been unavoidably detained, and he came back in the gayest spirits to find Clarice so changed that he started in dismay when he beheld her. The inexplicable attack of illness from which she had so narrowly escaped, accounted for her pallor and nervousness, but the change in her manner to himself must have some deeper source.</p> 
               <p>He glanced suspiciously toward Gulietta, and the look was not lost on Clarice.</p> 
                
               <p>"Yes, he fears that she has betrayed him," was her bitter thought, and she extricated herself from his embrace, and sat down white and panting with emotion.</p> 
               <p>Evoli had gone to the cove to meet him, but did not return with him. He had planted the germ of discord, and was sure of its fruit, but he did not care to witness its first budding. When they met he informed Guilio of the ill success of his mission to Bastia, but he heard it with more indifference than his agent expected. He merely said:</p> 
               <p>"I feared as much; but if I can ply my old trade as successfully as in this last venture, I can provide my dainty little queen all she can require."</p> 
               <p>"Aye-even to the hoped for residence in Paris?" asked Evoli.</p> 
               <p>Guilio colored, and hastily replied:</p> 
               <p>"That was an idle dream. Clarice could not have been in earnest. What figure could a wild Corsican outlaw make in Parisian society? No, <emph>my</emph> home is upon the mountain hight, and my true mate will also find her happiness there. I should pine and die in the close walls of a city."</p> 
               <p>"And she would flourish in it as an exotic in the warm air of the conservatory. Count Ernesti is wrong; if he could see the delicate loveliness of his daughter, he would receive her on her own terms."</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish him to receive her," replied Guilio, brusquely; "she is more my own, since his heart is closed to her; I will be all to her; she is everything to me."</p> 
               <p>Evoli turned away to conceal the expression of sarcastic doubt which appeared upon his face. Let Guilio cherish this fancied security; it would only enable him more surely to carry out his plans.</p> 
               <p>Falcone was only to remain at the cavern a week, and then make another cruise. To his surprise, Clarice did not object. He could not understand what had changed<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6335-00000177"/> her so much. At intervals flashes of her former gaiety shone forth; occasionally she was tender as in the early days of their union, but her manner was so fitful, her spirits so clouded, that she became utterly incomprehensible to the simple-hearted youth who loved her better than his own life.</p> 
               <p>"Alas! she regrets the sacrifice she is compelled to make for me," was his discouraging thought. "Yet if Clarice loved as fondly as I do, how light they would seem, so long as I adore her."</p> 
               <p>The days passed on, sometimes bringing Evoli as a chance guest, and Clarice felt with a sinking heart, and accusing conscience, how much his presence brightened her life. The charm of intellectual companionship once made known to her, caused her to feel more acutely the lack of sympathy between the highest aspirations of her nature and the more mundane soul of Guilio. The poetry that moved her to the very depths of her spirit, he regarded as a mere jingle of fine words; he was a creature of action, passion, and impulse; she one of feeling and sentiment. Had no discordant element mingled with their existence, they might have remained as true to each other as on the day they fled together; but long before the period allotted by her uncle's will expired, the scales hung evenly balanced between misery on one side, and desertion on the other.</p> 
               <p>In Guilio's absence, Evoli returned, and resumed the charmed readings. Clarice felt that this should not be permitted; but she had not the courage to banish him from her presence, for she daily felt how necessary to her happiness he had become. The two women concealed these visits from the herdsman, for he was true to the interests of his employer. Angelo was engaged with his out-door occupations all day, and when he returned, he was too weary to inquire into what passed during his absence.</p> 
                
               <p>Evoli had been in the habit of going and coming at his own pleasure, without notice or comment, and he now came and remained equally unobserved.</p> 
               <p>One evening he stood upon the platform with Clarice, looking for the return of Guilio's lugger. Suddenly she looked fixedly at him, and asked:</p> 
               <p>"What is the trade that Guilio carries on? The unusual luxury that surrounds me in this wild spot causes me to suspect, and fear, I scarcely know what."</p> 
               <p>"That he is more of an outlaw than even the vendetta would make him?" replied Evoli, significantly. "Is that your fear, Senora?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not believe him to be a pirate; that would be too dreadful; but he may be--"</p> 
               <p>She paused, and he added:</p> 
               <p>"A smuggler? exactly-you have guessed his occupation."</p> 
               <p>Clarice became very pale, her lips compressed themselves, and a gleam of pride flashed from her eyes. After a struggle, she said:</p> 
               <p>"I thought him only a fisherman, when I gave him my hand; and humble as the occupation is, I wish he had followed it in preference to the trade he really carries on. I shall henceforth loathe the elegance that is purchased by dishonorable gains."</p> 
               <p>"Then leave it forever, angel of my life," he passionately exclaimed. "Clarice, I am noble; I am rich; I ask you to share my home, and title. Your father's arms are opened to you; the church will break the bonds that bind you to this sterile spot. Leave Guilio to his first love, and come with me, for I adore you."</p> 
               <p>Clarice started from his side, and a crimson flush swept over her face; then her eyes met his, the blush faded to marble whiteness, and she burst in tears. Evoli would have<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6335-00000178"/> taken her hand, but she evaded him, and after a struggle to regain calmness, she said:</p> 
               <p>"My lot is fixed. What has induced you to believe that my allegiance to Guilio is shaken? Senor, you could not have been aware of the strength of your expressions just now."</p> 
               <p>There was a tremulous vibration in her voice, which revealed what her words were designed to conceal. Evoli fixed his pleading, passionate gaze upon her, and rapidly went on:</p> 
               <p>"You would immolate yourself upon the altar of fancied duty. Your heart is no longer your husband's. I have probed it to its depths, and I have read all its struggles; seen all its weakness; if weakness it be to respond to the passion of him who loves you with all the strength of his being; who can make you happy. Clarice, do not throw away the brightest hope of your life, and also of mine. The mountain outlaw should never have claimed you as his bride, and it is no crime to tear you from him."</p> 
               <p>"But he will destroy me if I prove faithless to him," her pale lips syllabled.</p> 
               <p>Evoli laughed scornfully:</p> 
               <p>"I will bear you so far beyond his reach, that he shall never find you again. Holy church will release you from your bondage; and as the heiress of your ancestral honors, as the Duchess of Evoli, you shall appear before the world the fairest and loveliest bride that ever blessed a happy and exulting husband. See, Clarice, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mia,</foreign> what <emph>I</emph> can give you, and compare it with the beggarly lot to which you would condemn yourself."</p> 
               <p>Clarice listened in breathless astonishment, and a dazzling vision of pomp and power swept before her for one brief moment; then she whispered in broken tones:</p> 
               <p>"Go away; I cannot, dare not listen to you. Leave me to my wretchedness and self-condemnation, for I have been false where I should most jealously have guarded my faith. Had you not seen this, you would never have spoken thus."</p> 
               <p>"And he too. You owe him no faith. What has Guilio been? Ask Gulietta, and she will tell you."</p> 
               <p>She started, as if a serpent had stung her.</p> 
               <p>"His falsehood is no excuse for mine. Besides, Guilio loves <emph>me</emph> now."</p> 
               <p>"And you have ceased to love him. It is the law of nature that like shall seek like. I have found my true Eve, and, whether she will or no, she must forsake her first Eden, and go forth with me."</p> 
               <p>"You speak as if you possess the power to compel," she haughtily replied.</p> 
               <p>"Only the sweet compulsion of love, my angel. Look into my eyes, and swear to me that I am mistaken, that your heart has never wandered from Guilio, and I leave you to him forever. Ah, bird of beauty, you dare not, for it would be perjury."</p> 
               <p>Clarice stood trembling and pale before the power thus daringly asserted, and even her resentment at his boldness seemed to die away as her eyes met his; were held in a gaze that gradually melted into tenderness which she had no power to conceal. Evoli folded her to his breast, and pressed his first kiss upon her glowing lips."</p> 
               <p>The next instant she tore herself from his clasp, and fled from him, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"Go, go-leave me forever. I will not be the companion of your flight. Forget this scene; forget me, for I shall soon be laid where oblivion falls on all."</p> 
               <p>She disappeared within the cave, and Evoli turned away with an expression of exulting triumph upon his features.</p> 
               <p>Three nights afterwards Matra received the following note:</p> 
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6335-00000179"/> 
               <p>"The time has come. Obey the directions of the bearer, and abide implicitly by the terms of our compact; thus your reward will be sure."</p> 
               <p>The ring which accompanied it attested its genuineness, and Matra, with savage joy, prepared at last to swoop down on his victim and destroy him.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE ABDUCTION. THE ANGUISH OF AN ACCUSING SPIRIT.</head> 
               <p>WHEN Guilio returned from his cruise, Clarice received him with remorseful tenderness. She felt bitterly self-condemned that she had permitted her thoughts to stray a moment from the duty she owed him. The pageant of pride and splendor that swept at intervals before her mental vision was sedulously put aside, and she chided her vain heart that it was tempted by them even for one instant to forsake the path of honor and duty.</p> 
               <p>Clarice had not seen Evoli since the evening she fled from him almost in a state of frenzied excitement. He went forth to meet Guilio, and did not return. As he left the cavern he exchanged a few words with Lisa. In reply she passionately whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Guilio will be unharmed? You could not abuse his kindness so foully as to injure him. Promise me this-swear it to me on your life, Senor."</p> 
               <p>"I only seek to bear away the woman I love," returned Evoli, evasively. "Have I not before pledged my word that your foster-son shall be well cared for? Since you shrink from this service, let Gulietta point the way to those who come hither to remove her rival. My life on it, she will do it willingly."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes, she will do it," answered Lisa, vaguely. "I do not know but I might falter at the last, for I fear-I fear that something fatal my happen. I have had warnings of death to one I love. Last night I saw a pale flame glimmering on the hill side; the owls filled the air with their cries, and the sheep dog responded to them in long, doleful wails, till I struck him and made him hush his pitiful clamor. But when he was quieted, it was only to hearken to the spirit drum beating its tattoo within a foot of my head."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, Lisa, you are full of Corsican superstitions, and of late you have had nothing better to do than to nurse such absurd fancies."</p> 
               <p>"You may speak as you will, Senor, but those omens never lie. Besides, as I lay upon my bed last night, I saw the figures of the departed flit past me, clad in the garments of the dead brothers, with hooded mantles and pointed caps, and their ghastly eyes shone on me through the masks they wore. I saw them surround a bier, take it upon their shoulders, and carry it off, as plainly as I see you standing before me now."</p> 
               <p>"It was but a dream, Lisa; you slept, and your dreams took the sombre hue of your fears," replied Evoli, impatiently. "At all hazards you must serve me, for I need you, and you are in my power. Think what your fate would be if I but hinted to Guilio the cause of his wife's illness."</p> 
               <p>"You would not-you dare not, Senor," she excitedly said.</p> 
               <p>"I both could, and would, if you fail me now," he resolutely replied. "It is too late to draw back."</p> 
               <p>"Then, then, it must be so; but should any evil befal<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6335-00000180"/> Guilio, the curse of a broken and deceived heart will surely follow you; aye, and cling to you forever."</p> 
               <p>Evoli impatiently turned away; he sternly said:</p> 
               <p>"On the sixth evening from this, hold yourself in readiness to admit those who will come hither."</p> 
               <p>He left her, and the woman wrung her hands in helpless anguish, for a great dread overshadowed her, and she feared the results that might flow from this treachery to one to whom she was bound by every tie of affection and interest. She saw the days, hours, and moments speed away toward its consummation in a kind of dumb horror. Mechanically she performed her accustomed tasks, and it was not until the last hour arrived that she found courage to impart to her daughter the service that must devolve on her. Lisa felt that she could not point out the path which would lead the myrmidons of Evoli into the secret recesses of their mountain stronghold, and Gulietta must perform this service.</p> 
               <p>When at last, in broken tones, she revealed their expected arrival to Gulietta, she received the information with a fierce burst of joy.</p> 
               <p>"At last," she panted, "the sickening sight of Guilio's devotion to this pale-faced idiot will be removed far from me. She has ceased to love him, yet he fawns around her, and loads her with caresses which she passively receives. Yes, I am ready to point out the way to those who come at her lover's bidding to tear her from his arms."</p> 
               <p>They stood in the upper cavern while they thus spoke together, and as Gulietta ended, Evoli stood before them. He briefly said:</p> 
               <p>"All is ready; my friends will be here in a few more moments. I have preceded them, that I may be ready to bear away my prize through the lower outlet. A felucca awaits me near the grotto; the tide is out, and we can pass through the opening to the sea. Gulietta, I see that your nerves are strung up to the requisite point, but where is Angelo?"</p> 
               <p>"He has gone down to the villages to sell our cheeses, as is his custom every month."</p> 
               <p>"So much the better; we have nothing, then, to fear from his interference. Be firm; when you hear a whistle from without, swing your lamp above your head as a signal, and four trusty men will enter, and follow your steps. Guide them over the rocky descent, and leave the rest to me."</p> 
               <p>"Senor, you only seek to remove <emph>her;</emph> you will give me back my Guilio in safety?" asked the girl, with tremulous fierceness.</p> 
               <p>"I swear to leave him to you; his safety shall be cared for. Does that satisfy you?"</p> 
               <p>"It does," she murmured. "He will be mine; I ask no more."</p> 
               <p>Evoli rapidly passed on, with stern brow and compressed lips. He left the carefully-concealed doors open behind him, and, carrying a small lantern in his hand, threaded his way quickly toward the quiet retreat so soon to become the scene of violence and bloodshed.</p> 
               <p>For months Evoli's mind had been firmly made up to the necessity of sacrificing the man he had once called friend, but at this last moment he would have saved him had it been possible to do so without ultimate destruction to himself. He knew the Corsican nature too well to trust his future safety to the wronged and outraged husband. To ensure that, Guilio must die; then why should he recoil from the dire necessity that drove him onward? Had not Falcone also caused the sacrifice of life to gain Clarice; then why should he shrink from delivering him up to the avengers of blood that were even now upon his track?</p> 
               <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6335-00000181"/> 
               <p>If a momentary relenting had weakened his purpose, it was put to flight by the scene that greeted his eyes as he lifted the curtain that hung over the inner apartment. Clarice sat with her head resting upon her husband's bosom, her hand clasped in his, and a smile upon her lips as she listened to his voice in a dreamy kind of languor which she vainly tried to believe was akin to their old happiness together.</p> 
               <p>At the sound of Evoli's footstep she started up, blushed vividly, and greeted him with a cold hauteur he readily comprehended. It was their first meeting since the passionate scene which preceded Guilio's last return, for since that evening Evoli had purposely held himself aloof. Now the sequel to it was to be enacted, and he nerved himself for that which must speedily follow his arrival.</p> 
               <p>Guilio arose, and welcomed his comrade with cordial frankness.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad to see you back, Benedetto, for we have sadly missed you, and my lady-bird here has secretly wished for you, I am sure, to read aloud the strains of poetry she so much admires. I wish that my taste lay that way, but it does not, more's the pity."</p> 
               <p>"Do not underrate yourself, Guilio," said the low voice of Clarice. "You are sufficiently educated to appreciate the poetry of books, but you naturally prefer that of action. The incidents of our wedding day would make a pretty epic, I am sure."</p> 
               <p>"Shall I write it for you, Senora?" asked Evoli, significantly.</p> 
               <p>"Are you poet enough to make the attempt?" she replied, without looking toward him, for the impress of his kiss yet burned upon her lips, and she feared to encounter again the eyes which had wrenched from her the secret she had scarcely dared to acknowledge to herself. She trembled in his presence, yet her heart had given a great bound when she heard the sound of his well-known footstep.</p> 
               <p>Yet in all probability he had come to bid them adieu forever, for he had said his next visit would be his last, as he was on the eve of returning to his native country. At this thought her heart sank like lead in her bosom, and a film spread over her vision; but she aroused herself from this momentary trance of feeling. She would be true to her wedded lord, though her heart broke in the struggle; and Clarice sat calm, pale, and outwardly composed, while a whirlwind of feeling and emotion rushed through her soul. Evoli said:</p> 
               <p>"I have come to bid you adieu. The felucca of Barnardo awaits me below the grotto, and I must avail myself of the low tide to get safely out of the archway."</p> 
               <p>"Yes-that was a good idea, Benedetto, for we have more than once passed safely through it, but I am sorry to part from you, my old comrade. You have made my life joyous in other days, and you have witnessed my happiness since I brought my queen hither. We can never forget you-never. Clarice, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">mia,</foreign> can you find nothing to say to my old friend, although he may be going from us, perhaps never to return."</p> 
               <p>Clarice was speechless; she felt as if a great weight had suddenly fallen upon her heart, and a giant hand seemed clutching her throat. She held out her hand, which Evoli took in his; he felt that it was icy cold, yet its touch thrilled him to the soul.</p> 
               <p>At that instant a noise was heard in the outer hall; steps were passing over the chapel floor, heavy, unfamiliar steps, and Guilio sprang toward the entrance, exclaiming:</p> 
               <p>"What does this mean? Who enters my stronghold? Can it be that we are betrayed?"</p> 
               <p>Clarice would have shrieked, but her voice was frozen on<pb n="378-379" xml:id="VAC6335-00000182"/> her lips as the curtains parted, and four armed men rushed toward Guilio. There was one moment of blinding horror, and then she impulsively threw herself forward to place herself between her husband and his assassins, but Evoli tore her back; he wound his powerful arms around her, and held her firmly in his clasp, while Matra and his bravos rushed on Guilio with cries of-</p> 
               <p>"Vendetta, vendetta; thus we avenge the blood of our slain. Go to thy doom, assassin."</p> 
               <p>Of lithe and agile frame, Guilio desperately defended himself, but in a few moments he fell beneath the daggers aimed at his life. At this unexpected consummation, Gulietta rushed in with wild cries, and threw herself beside him. Clarice had fainted, and while the avengers coolly wiped their weapons, and looked down upon the body from which life was welling through many ghastly wounds, Evoli bore his prize away from the scene of blood. He rapidly descended the steps leading to the grotto, followed by one of the men who had taken no part in the conflict.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta had guided the men to the entrance of the chapel, believing that Guilio would be bound, and left to be released by herself; but the clash of weapons, the cries that came from the scene of the conflict, revealed too late the extent of the treachery to which she had become a party. Now she wailed, tore her hair, and acted all the extravagances of the wildest grief and remorse.</p> 
               <p>"Wretches!" she exclaimed, with glaring eyes and foaming lips, "you were only to have borne the girl away, but you have killed my Guilio, my pride, my darling, the life of my life. Go away; leave me to my despair and penitence, for they will never end."</p> 
               <p>The men, rude as they were, recoiled before the sudden blaze of madness that flashed from her eyes. One of them said:</p> 
                
               <p>"She will do us a mischief; put your knife in her, Piero, and end this pother; her squalling deafens me."</p> 
               <p>"No-I will not kill a woman: that was not what I bargained for. We expressly spared the chief's wife from the vendetta, then wherefore take the life of this poor girl? By Bacchus! but this den is grandly fitted up, and one can find something more valuable to take away than the blood of our victim."</p> 
               <p>At this crisis Lisa rushed in, her hair streaming wildly over her person, and uttering shriek after shriek. She turned fiercely upon the men, and said:</p> 
               <p>"You have had your hour, and now your own doom comes. Antonio, my husband, is here with twenty men at his back, and they will speedily avenge him you have slain."</p> 
               <p>At this announcement the assassins gathered hastily together, and rushed toward the entrance, for they fully believed that a whole band of outlaws were coming upon them. Lisa followed quickly upon their steps, and closed the doors as they passed through them. When they reached the outer cavern, the men stood in bewildered surprise, for there was no enemy there to encounter. They groped about a few moments to find the door, but soon comprehended that they had been baffled by the superior cunning of a woman. Finding the quest hopeless, they stumbled to the entrance, and went on their way consoling themselves for the loss of plunder with the prospect of the reward that awaited them for the successful consummation of their enterprise.</p> 
               <p>With fleet steps Lisa returned to the side of her daughter. She hoarsely said:</p> 
               <p>"Get up, girl; cease your wailing, and let us see if anything can be done to help my poor boy. Curse the cruel hearts that dealt the blows, curse the treacherous one that led them on. Too late-too late, I see his purpose."</p> 
               <pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6335-00000183"/> 
               <p>There was hope breathed in her words, and as Gulietta comprehended their sense, she hushed her cries, raised her prostrate form, and looked upon the face of Guilio. It seemed already set in death, and the girl clasped her hands despairingly.</p> 
               <p>"They have killed him! and I, blind fool that I was, led them on. Oh, mother, I shall go wild! I cannot live with this burden upon me."</p> 
               <p>Lisa scarcely heeded her; she knelt beside the wounded man, placed her hand upon his heart, felt his wrist to see if a feeble pulsation yet remained, and she rapidly said:</p> 
               <p>"There is life in him yet. I know of herbs that will stanch the flow of blood. They have cut and hacked him fearfully, but he may not have a vital wound, and we may save him yet."</p> 
               <p>The hope thus expressed inspired the girl with new life. She stifled her cries, and assisted her mother to lift the prostrate form and place it on the bed. As they did so Guilio uttered a faint moan, and with renewed hope they proceeded with their labor of love. Four deep wounds were found upon his person, three of which were in his breast, but the most deadly one had been dealt upon his head from behind.</p> 
               <p>With infinite labor the welling tide of life was stanched; Lisa's skill proved to be by no means contemptible, and while she dressed his wounds her daughter moistened his lips with wine, and chafed his cold hands between her own. The result of all their care proved that its object still breathed, but no more. Guilio lay as insensible as death itself, and thus Angelo found him when he returned to the cave.</p> 
               <p>The two women gave a confused account of the surprise and attack, carefully concealing their own share in the treachery, and laying its whole burden on the false Benedetto. The herdsman believed them, for he was simple and unsuspicious, and all his care was devoted to the restoration of his wounded master.</p> 
               <p>For weeks Guilio lay vibrating between life and death, unconscious of all that passed around him. Life rallied so slowly, that for days the two women who seduously watched him thought all hope was gone; but they did not relax their efforts to save him, and at last he unclosed his sunken eyes, and looked around as if seeking something he missed with pain. With a shuddering sigh he relapsed into his old state, and another wearing interval of suspense ensued. But at last their efforts were crowned with success, and Guilio awoke to consciousness, though weak and helpless as an infant. His first connected words formed themselves into an inquiry for Clarice.</p> 
               <p>Lisa and her daughter had their story prepared. With many precautions and much circumlocution, they finally told him that his wife had thrown herself between him and his assassins, and thus perished. Guilio started up, uttered a great cry, and fell back insensible. When he recovered he was quite delirious, and the feeble thread of life was with difficulty prevented from snapping in the dire conflict that ensued. Fever burned in his veins, delirium raged in his brain, and his piercing cries for his lost love might have moved the heart of a stone.</p> 
               <p>Angelo was deeply touched by his ravings, and when Guilio again looked upon him with a vision unclouded by delirium, he wished to undeceive him and show him how unworthy of his love he believed Clarice to have proved herself. But Lisa used all her art to persuade him that it was better to delude the forsaken husband with this belief than to let him know she had fled with her lover. She insisted that Benedetto was a great and powerful prince, who would take swift vengeance both on Guilio and themselves if an attempt was made to avenge his duplicity.</p> 
               <pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6335-00000184"/> 
               <p>Angelo listened to her reasoning and yielded, for he had great faith in Lisa's superior shrewdness; besides, as she argued, it would be better to have their daughter as the future mistress of their stronghold than a strange girl who was so unsuited to their way of life.</p> 
               <p>It was three months before Guilio was able to visit the platform, and look out upon the sea. He asked to see the grave of his lost Clarice, and a mound prepared by Angelo, with many remorseful misgivings, was shown to him as her last resting place. This he decked with flowers and shells; he watered it with his tears, and knelt beside it when he prayed.</p> 
               <p>The blow upon his head seemed to have permanently injured his brain, for a dull apathy clouded all his faculties, and his days were spent beside the mound, or in sitting upon the platform gazing in sombre vacancy upon the sea. All his interest in life seemed ended, and Gulietta followed, watched over, and talked with him, without producing any impression. He replied to her briefly and coldly, but did not seem to care whether she went or came.</p> 
               <p>Guilio's heart lay dead within him, and the fearful struggle for life through which he had passed appeared to have exhausted all the vital power both of mind and body. Gulietta fretted fiercely beneath this untoward condition of affairs, but she still persevered, in the forlorn hope of winning him from the contemplation of the past, to appreciate all the love and care of which he had been the object.</p> 
               <p>Thus we must leave him, and follow the retreating footsteps of Evoli and his hard won prize.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE HEIRESS IN HER FATHER'S HOME. FATHER GREGORY'S REVELATION.</head> 
               <p>CLARICE lay cold and insensible upon the bosom of her abductor. Evoli, followed by one of the men, reached the grotto, his attendant unmoored the boat, in the stern of which Clarice was tenderly placed. The tide was low, and the archway that opened toward the sea was high enough to permit the small craft to pass out without difficulty.</p> 
               <p>As the man rowed toward it, Evoli busied himself with attempts to restore consciousness to the insensible girl, but without effect, and he urged the rower to speed away as rapidly as possible. Under the impulse of the man's powerful strokes the light boat shot swiftly toward the opening; a few clinging vines and aquatic plants were torn away, and they were rocking on the open sea.</p> 
               <p>An arrow's flight from the towering cliff lay a felucca evidently awaiting their appearance; for as they approached, the anchor was lifted, and preparations for instant departure were made. By the time our party reached the deck the vessel was ready to wing her rapid flight from the shores of Corsica, and in a few more moments she was under way.</p> 
               <p>Clarice was immediately conveyed to a cabin prepared for her use, where a young girl impatiently awaited her appearance. She flew toward the insensible form, clasped it fondly, and wept over it; she used all her art to recall the dormant life, and hailed the first symptoms of revival with a burst of joy sadly at variance with the piercing cry of anguish that issued from the lips of Clarice in the first moment of consciousness.</p> 
               <p>"Why do you weep, my Clarice?" asked a well-known<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6335-00000185"/> voice. "You are with those who love you; for your own Ninetta is restored to you. See-I have come from Isola Rossa to serve as your maid, for you are a great lady now."</p> 
               <p>Clarice impulsively fell upon her neck, and wept as if her heart would break. She at length said:</p> 
               <p>"If I could feel glad for anything, Ninetta, it would be to have you with me again; but I am wretched and broken-hearted. My Guilio has perished in the vendetta; I saw him fall, pierced with many fatal wounds, and how or why I was spared I know not. At the moment he was struck down I became insensible, and I awoke to find myself here. Who brought me hither? who provided for my safety, and placed you here to console me?"</p> 
               <p>Ninetta had learned the story she was to tell, and we must do her the justice to say that she believed it. She instantly replied:</p> 
               <p>"A great Italian lord who is a friend of your father, has been hiding in your cavern. Matra's family have been raging for the accomplishment of the vendetta against poor Guilio. You, too, were to have been sacrificed through the treachery of a woman named Lisa, whose daughter Guilio was once pledged to marry. They gave admittance to the assassins, on condition that you should be the sacrifice to the vengeance of Matra's relatives, as it was on your account he lost his life.</p> 
               <p>"Senor Benedetto discovered their intended treachery too late to prevent its execution, but a large bribe induced the murderers to spare you, and destroy your husband. Thus you owe him your life, for he it was who rescued you from the daggers of the assassins; he it was who saved you when those two women had poisoned you in Guilio's absence."</p> 
               <p>Clarice started convulsively, and became even paler than before; but she said nothing, and Ninetta went on:</p> 
               <p>"Senor Benedetto engaged the vessel of your old friend, Barnardo, to convey you to your father, who is impatiently expecting you. He came to my mother and offered her such terms for my services that she consented to part from me, and here I am."</p> 
               <p>Clarice shuddered, and turned her face to the wall, weeping bitterly. In vain did Ninetta endeavor to console her; in this hour of deepest anguish no earthly voice could whisper peace to her wrung soul. She could only murmur, at intervals:</p> 
               <p>"Oh! my Guilio-murdered! lying cold, cold in your blood! and for my sake. Alas! I am fatal to all that love me; two men slain on my account-faithless, false as I have been! Oh, it is horrible, horrible! Ninetta, give me something to bring oblivion. I must sleep or go mad in my anguish!"</p> 
               <p>Her excited appearance alarmed the girl, and she hastily sought Evoli. He came with her to the side of Clarice, but she wildly motioned him from her.</p> 
               <p>"Go away! go away! I cannot bear your presence yet. The life you have rescued is worthless-the father to whom you would take me will receive only a hopeless, broken wreck! Let me die! that is all that is left me now."</p> 
               <p>Evoli made no attempt to reason with or console her; he understood the phase of anguish and self-accusation through which she we passing too well to oppose mere words to the torrent of her grief. He silently mixed a powerful narcotic, and leaving whispered directions with Ninetta to watch constantly beside her, glided away. The girl faithfully administered the potion, and sat in perturbed silence till her charge sunk into a broken slumber, interrupted by deep moans and muttered words, imploring pardon from him whose spirit she believed had been ruthlessly severed from his body.</p> 
               <p>At intervals she started up with staring eyes and quivering hands, making vain efforts to clutch the airy phantoms<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6335-00000186"/> that flitted before her mental vision; but at last she sank into the deep sleep produced by artificial means, and lay white and motionless, though her deep breathing indicated the strong young life that wrestled in her frame.</p> 
               <p>Evoli who had been watching with deep solicitude at her door, again entered, and observed her condition carefully. In reply to Ninetta's look of inquiry, he briefly said:</p> 
               <p>"She will recover from the shock, and regain all her old elasticity. Yes-she will awake to life and happiness again. Be faithful to the trust confided to you, Ninetta, and all will be well."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, Senor, I love her, and will do all I can for her," was the reply; and again she was left to her watch of affection. Evoli joined Barnardo on deck, and they sought a retired spot to confer with each other. The captain spoke, with cynical contempt:</p> 
               <p>"I did not believe you would succeed, yet you have won the outlaw's bride, and will bear her in triumph to her father. How has it been accomplished?"</p> 
               <p>"Not through a woman's weakness, as you evidently think. The friends of Matra have carried out the vendetta, and at a heavy price I purchased exemption for this young creature. I would have saved her at the cost of my own life, had that been necessary."</p> 
               <p>"Humph! then the wretches have murdered the lad in revenge for the crime <emph>I</emph> committed? I begin to think myself a paltry scoundrel, not to have proclaimed the truth, and taken the vendetta on myself."</p> 
               <p>"In that case you would have given the Senora up to them, for in her rescue the life of Matra was taken. Balked of vengeance either on you or Guilio, her life would surely have been sacrificed. We have but played a game in which life was the stake, and you and I, by superior craft, have been the victors."</p> 
                
               <p>"True; but is the life of this poor girl worth that of my fearless comrade? I trow not; but you have a way of binding people to your will, my lord, that is incomprehensible to me. What is your secret? Pray, tell me, that I may try it on my refractory men."</p> 
               <p>Evoli's peculiar smile gleamed an instant on his lip, and he carelessly replied:</p> 
               <p>"It is one you understand pretty well already. An iron will, that never falters in its purpose; in addition to which, nature has bestowed on me other advantages, which I know how to use with the best effect. That is all. Good night; the moon has risen, to light us on our way, and our voyage promises to be a prosperous one. I must sleep a few hours before we reach our haven; for the scene through which I lately passed has shaken even my firm nerves a little."</p> 
               <p>Barnardo gazed after him; with an expression half of admiration, half of envy, he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"It is almost a pity he is a duke, for he would make a splendid captain of a privateer. But with his chances, I should never have trod the deck of one myself. Well, my old enemy will get back his daughter, but the end is not yet," and Barnardo, a true servitor of fortune, reconciled himself to the part he had been induced to play, with the thought of the large reward he should gain for his services. He regretted the sacrifice of Guilio, though he congratulated himself that the vendetta had not fallen to his own lot; he had slain his enemy, and another had borne the penalty; such was the decree of fate, therefore why should he grieve; and he drowned such qualms of conscience as would arise, in a bottle of strong wine.</p> 
               <p>On the evening of a calm and lovely day, a litter was borne into the hall of Ernesti Castle, in which reclined a drooping form only half aroused from the death-like lethargy<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6335-00000187"/> produced by the narcotics, under the influence of which it had been found necessary to keep Clarice. She was immediately carried to a magnificent apartment which had been prepared for her reception, for Count Ernesti had been forewarned of her arrival, and he had himself superintended the fitting up of the suite of rooms appropriated to her use.</p> 
               <p>He did not appear to welcome his long-lost daughter, for at the last moment his feelings overcame him, and he retired to the room of penitence, to look upon Ginevra's portrait, and pray again for pardon for his great wrong against her, before he claimed the love of her child.</p> 
               <p>Many hours elapsed before he went slowly to the door of Clarice, and asked for admittance. The middle-aged housekeeper answered his knock, and seeing who the visitor was, she turned toward the bed on which the pale sufferer had been placed, and respectfully said:</p> 
               <p>"It is the Count, my lady, who has come to welcome you to your home."</p> 
               <p>At this announcement, Clarice lifted her heavy eyelids, half arose, and faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"Let him come; I am his alone now."</p> 
               <p>Ernesti motioned to the women to retire, and closed the door. Then he glided toward the couch, lifted the half-sinking form, and clasped her to his breast, while tears fell like rain over her face, and broken words fell from his lips.</p> 
               <p>"O, my child, my pride, my darling, why have you been kept from me so long, for my heart and home have been desolate without you."</p> 
               <p>"Alas! I now come to you broken and crushed. My life is desolate, but it shall henceforth be devoted to you. No other claims me now, my father."</p> 
               <p>"Then we will be all in all to each other, and you shall console me for all the misery of the past."</p> 
               <p>As the count looked upon the pale face that rested upon his breast, he could not repress a shiver, for in the anguish impressed upon it, he saw again that expression which gleamed white and cold upon him in that hour of supreme despair when Ginevra appealed to him in vain for mercy.</p> 
               <p>He softly laid her upon her pillows, and wiped the cold drops from his brow which that memory called there. A gulf which he could not pass seemed to open between himself and his child, and he sat down chilled and terrified. Had she come to him as a Nemesis, or as a blessing? Had he torn her from her happiness, only to become a living dread to himself? It was a fearful question, but one which only time and Fate could answer.</p> 
               <p>After a dreary pause, Clarice gently said:</p> 
               <p>"I am unable to talk with you now, my father. Mind and body are so overwhelmed by the dreadful scenes through which I have lately passed, that I must have rest. I shall soon be better, and then I will make such efforts as I can to brighten the home into which you wished me to enter. I need help, consolation, under the burden of my sorrow. Is there no holy man attached to your house, who can speak peace to my distracted spirit?"</p> 
               <p>The count arose with alacrity.</p> 
               <p>"You are right, my daughter; I will send Father Gregory to you. He can speak such words as will bring back composure to the heart that is sorely stricken, and I will leave you to his ministrations."</p> 
               <p>"Let him come to me without delay, then, I entreat you."</p> 
               <p>Her father bent over, and lightly kissed her brow, then he left the room, feeling as if a weight had been lifted from his heart. Yes, her very presence was an oppression, for her voice, her eyes brought vividly before him the awful record of the past, and he sorrowfully asked himself how long he could endure it and live.</p> 
               <p>Soon after the count's departure, a light tap was struck<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6335-00000188"/> upon her door, and the venerable priest entered, and drew near to the bed. Father Gregory's heart was filled with compassion as he looked upon the broken lily that lay upon it, and he at once addressed himself to the task that lay before him; to bind up this bruised heart, heal the wounds of the tender conscience, and reconcile her to the life that now lay before her, so dark and hopeless.</p> 
               <p>Since her marriage, Clarice had not been to confession, and she humbly and penitently laid bare her soul before him. She concealed nothing; even the momentary wandering of her heart from the husband she had chosen, was revealed, for now this seemed to her an inexpiable crime.</p> 
               <p>When she finished, the priest prayed with her, and inflicted such a penance as would compel her to arouse herself from the state of apathy into which she seemed in danger of falling; for Father Gregory was a keen observer, and he comprehended that the reaction of her present grief might bring with it lassitude and languor she would not struggle against without some powerful motive to counteract them.</p> 
               <p>He set before her the new duties that devolved upon her, and exacted from her a promise that she would seek to perform them as became a conscientious daughter of the church. When she had pledged herself to all he required, and he seemed about to leave her, Clarice said:</p> 
               <p>"Before you go, holy father, tell me something of my mother. Did you know her? Have you been long in the household of Count Ernesti?"</p> 
               <p>The change that came over his face caused her to think she had committed an indiscretion. An expression of reserve succeeded the bland mildness with which he had hitherto regarded her, and he replied, with evident reluctance:</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my daughter, your mother was well known to me. What can you expect me to reveal that is not already known to you?"</p> 
                
               <p>"I really know nothing. My parents parted in anger; my mother was thrown off, or eloped, I know not which. Oh! my mother, my dead mother, clear her fame to her unhappy child, if it can be done."</p> 
               <p>The priest was deeply moved, and after a pause, he said:</p> 
               <p>"The living and the dead equally claim your reverence, my daughter. Your father opens his arms to receive you; your mother lies in her quiet grave, so let her rest. She was imprudent, but not guilty. Your parents did not understand each other. Over their final rupture let a veil be drawn; mine shall never be the hand to lift it."</p> 
               <p>She sighed as if a heavy weight was lifted from her mind, and softly said:</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, father, for this much. I will endeavor to follow your counsels, and in the performance of the duties allotted to me on earth, perhaps the sunshine of peace will again fall on my soul. Pray for me that I may have strength to walk in my new path in faith and honor."</p> 
               <p>This the priest readily promised, and giving her his blessing he departed. Clarice, composed and elevated by this brief communion with a strong, God-fearing soul, closed her eyes in a balmy slumber, that gave new life to her drooping frame.</p> 
               <p>Evoli, after a long and confidential interview with Count Ernesti, set forth for his own castle. He bore with him the certainty that his return would be welcomed both by the Count and his daughter; for the present, he felt that it would be best to absent himself for a season, as Clarice would naturally shrink at this time from all that brought back to her the memory of the recent painful events of her life.</p> 
               <p>We must briefly pass over the succeeding months, though<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6335-00000189"/> each day bore its record in the experience of the young creature so suddenly placed on such an eminence of worldly power and pride. Every luxury that wealth could command was hers; every taste that could be ministered to, through its means was gratified at any cost. The heroine of a fairy tale could scarcely have had her fancies more completely realized than were those of the new found heiress of Count Ernesti.</p> 
               <p>Her father anticipated her wishes, and each day brought some new proof of his pride and affection; yet, after that first moment of meeting, his manner toward her never softened. Clarice felt that she was the heiress to his haughty line-the darling of his pride, but nothing more. A dividing line seemed to be drawn between them; and in her loneliness she often felt that the privilege of weeping upon his breast, of kissing his worn brow, those sad, firmly closed lips, would have been worth all the baubles he lavished upon her.</p> 
               <p>She wished to wear mourning for her lost love, but to this the count would not consent. All the pride of his nature recoiled from the thought that his daughter should wear the outward symbols of grief for a low-born outlaw, with whom it was degradation to remember she had ever been connected. He insisted that she should wear such robes as befitted her new state, and she yielded to what she believed to be her duty to him. The name of Guilio was never pronounced in his presence, and gradually the memory of what he had been to her faded from the heart of her who had ceased to love him before she was torn from him.</p> 
               <p>Intellectual culture, for which Clarice had so deeply pined, opened its stores to her eager mind, and under the guidance of Father Gregory she made rapid progress in the studies she undertook. Other masters were called to her assistance, and lighter accomplishments cultivated, and in one year from her restoration to her birthright, she was a brilliant and beautiful woman, fully conscious of her own powers, and eager to try them in the arena of fashion.</p> 
               <p>During that time she had greatly changed. Ambition to excel swayed her heart; pride of family and station had fully imbued her mind, and she became plastic in the hands of her imperious father. Count Ernesti impressed his own views upon the nature she inherited from himself, and Clarice learned to look back with a feeling of humiliation upon the humble associations of her childhood, and she finally parted from Ninetta because she brought them back daily to her remembrance.</p> 
               <p>The young girl was liberally provided for, and an annuity was settled on Senora Marcante sufficient to enable her to eclipse all of her class in Isola Rossa. Ninetta gladly returned to her own home, for she preferred the freedom of her mother's house to servitude in that of the count, and a more fashionable maid was found for the young countess.</p> 
               <p>During this time Evoli was often a guest at the castle. At first he was received with chilling reserve, for Clarice was a true woman, and her pride was wounded by the thought that this man had fathomed all the weakness of her heart; he had won her allegiance from her husband, and now he might presume upon this knowledge to assert claims she did not feel disposed to concede.</p> 
               <p>But Evoli was much too politic to commit this error; he did not even devote himself to her as he had done in other days. He left the charm of his presence, the sympathy in their tastes, to prove to her that fate had designed them for each other, and ere Clarice was aware of her danger, her heart was more deeply enthralled than before.</p> 
               <p>The love she had felt for Guilio she now knew was a child's dream; this was the engrossing, all-absorbing passion of a woman who has felt and suffered, the depths of<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6335-00000190"/> whose inner nature had been sounded, and who had learned to understand herself. In vain did she struggle against the conviction, that this man was her master, for she felt it in every quivering throb of her heart, in every pulsation of her being.</p> 
               <p>With subtle power, Evoli read and comprehended the fluctuations of Clarice's mind, and when she reached that point at which her pride might take the alarm if his outward indifference continued, he resumed his old habit of devotion to her. He read, walked, sang with her, and entered into all her employments with a zest that gave them double piquancy.</p> 
               <p>Evoli made his presence necessary to her, and then suddenly left the castle without coming to any explanation. Clarice missed him during every moment of the long days, and felt that life was becoming a burden to her. Her spirits drooped, and her father proposed a visit to Rome. She eagerly consented, and in the Eternal City she made her first appearance in society. Her beauty, noble family, and reputed fortune, drew around her a crowd of admirers, and the debut of the charming countess was regarded as the event of the season. But after the first flush of triumph passed away, Clarice turned from them all with a sigh of weariness, to find amusement and interest in the monuments of departed greatness which attest the grandeur of the race that has passed away.</p> 
               <p>One night she stood in the Coliseum, watching the effect of the moonlight upon its crumbling walls; she had strayed from her party to be alone a few moments, that her fancy might go back to the days of old, and re-people the vast arena with its shouting crowds looking down upon the dying struggles of the gladiator. Suddenly a stately form stood beside her, a voice that made her heart bound with rapture called her name.</p> 
                
               <p>Evoli had arrived during her absence, and had immediately set out to join her. A struggling moonbeam fell over her face, and he read his welcome in the flash of joy that swept over it. He seized that unguarded moment to pour into her ear the story of his hopes and fears, of the adoring love which must find a return, or become the burden of his life.</p> 
               <p>The time was skilfully chosen, and Clarice returned to her father the betrothed bride of the proudest duke in Italy. Count Ernesti received the announcement with deep gratification. The dearest wish of his heart was thus accomplished, and once more his lips were pressed upon the brow of his daughter as he congratulated her upon the brilliant future opening before her. When left alone, he muttered:</p> 
               <p>"The curse has passed from my house. The fatal mark has not marred her fate, for <emph>my</emph> child will be great and happy. Duchess of Evoli, and a noble man for her husband. Ah! Father Gregory will cease his croaking now, I hope."</p> 
               <p>As if the thought had evoked his presence, a knock came to his door, and the priest, looking pale and careworn, entered the room. The count greeted him with surprise, in which some apprehension was mingled.</p> 
               <p>"What brings you hither, father? I hope nothing has happened at the castle of so important a nature as to force you from your beloved seclusion?"</p> 
               <p>"Everything there is as quiet as usual, my son. But I have received a piece of information of such importance that I could entrust it to no other person, so I came hither myself to communicate it."</p> 
               <p>"Then let me hear it at once. Is my daughter interested in it?"</p> 
               <p>"You have rightly guessed, my lord. My news is vital to her future happiness. I have a letter from Francesco<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6335-00000191"/> Vivaldi, from which I learned that Falcone was not murdered; he was desperately wounded, but he is yet living, though in a state of weakness both of mind and body, which time seems powerless to heal. He believes that his wife perished in the vendetta, and he makes no effort to arouse himself from the state of apathy into which he has fallen."</p> 
               <p>The count uttered an exclamation of angry dismay.</p> 
               <p>"Living! The wretch! what right has he yet to cumber the earth? Yet it really matters very little, father, for the divorce for which I applied has been granted by the church, and my daughter is now the betrothed of the Duke of Evoli. My lessons have fallen on good ground, and the pride of Clarice would induce her to spurn her first lover, even if she were not strongly attached to Evoli.</p> 
               <p>The priest sighed heavily.</p> 
               <p>"I see, I see how it is. I have watched your daughter, and I have seen the imperious blood of your race assert its pride. I also saw the tender heart of her mother yield to the power of him who won her troth. Yet, my lord, in this hour of elation, painful as it is to me to utter a warning to recall the past history of your house, it becomes my duty to tell you of something which singularly refers to it."</p> 
               <p>The count became very pale, for he was superstitious, and with difficulty he said:</p> 
               <p>"Let me hear what you have to say."</p> 
               <p>The priest cast on him a piercing glance, and nerved himself for the disclosure he had to make.</p> 
               <p>"You are aware, my lord, of the tradition in your family that your noted ancestor, Count Ludovic, received from a learned eastern astrologer a prediction concerning the fate of his house. This was carefully concealed from his descendants, nor had its hiding-place been sought for, as it was vaguely understood that its discovery would herald the extinction of his race."</p> 
                
               <p>The listener bowed his head, and visibly trembled, but he could not speak; the priest went on:</p> 
               <p>"A violent storm lately burst over the castle, and the wall of the ruinous room in the rear of the chapel fell in. A recess was laid bare in which some relics and parchments had been concealed. One of the latter bore a rude drawing representing an armed knight, with a woman at his feet, on whose breast his dagger thrusts had marked the sacred symbol of martyrdom. Below it, traced in Greek characters, which were still clear and distinct, was the prophecy given by the Arabian astrologer to your ancestor. Here is a rough translation which I have made: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"'A storm will rage whene'er this page</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">Be given to mortal scan;</l> 
                        <l>Then tremble, man, before the ban</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">Of thy portentous doom-</l> 
                        <l>The last of all thy haughty race</l> 
                        <l>Will perish in her youth and grace,</l> 
                        <l>And he whose hand bears bloody brand,</l> 
                        <l>Be left in lonely pride of place,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">A prey to endless gloom.'"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>The count listened with an expression of pale terror that appalled his companion. He gasped:</p> 
               <p>"It is not true! it shall not prove true. The prophecy does not apply to me. The caitiff perished by suffocation; I did not soil my hands with his ignoble blood."</p> 
               <p>The priest compassionately regarded him. He slowly said:</p> 
               <p>"The blood of your victim is not the less upon your soul because you stifled its flow in place of shedding it. Alas, my son, I have gloomy fears and forebodings for the welfare of you and yours."</p> 
               <p>By a mighty effort the count recovered seeming composure. After a long pause, he said:</p> 
               <p>"The day for such superstitious nonsense has passed<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6335-00000192"/> away. We are more enlightened now, father, and can laugh at such a prediction as this. Destroy the parchment, and forget its contents, as I shall. My daughter shall become Duchess of Evoli, and her fate will not be marred by those ancient rhymes."</p> 
               <p>The priest bowed his head.</p> 
               <p>"I will obey you, my lord, and I trust that your hopes will not be blighted by a power which sets all our puny efforts at nought. Your daughter has become very dear to my heart, and any evil that menaces her, I would gladly avert by every means in my power. If prayers can avail in your favor, you both have them from me."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you, father, and now to other matters. Tell me of young Vivaldi. What is he doing, and how does he bear the loss of his uncle's fortune?"</p> 
               <p>"As a true man should. A friend has obtained promotion for him, and he has also acquired a considerable accession of fortune, he does not explain by what means, and Mademoiselle Villeray has given him her hand. Thus his happiness and prosperity are provided for."</p> 
               <p>"That is well; when Clarice is old enough to act for herself, it is her purpose to be liberal toward her cousin. I shall not interfere, for she will have the right to do as she pleases with her own fortune. When you see her, I beg that you will give no hint of this discovery. It might affect her spirits, and she is happy now."</p> 
               <p>"I will be careful not to do so, my lord. God forbid that I should shadow the sunshine in which she may for a season dwell. That it may continue is my earnest prayer."</p> 
               <p>After a few moments of deep thought the count said:</p> 
               <p>"Vivaldi is aware of the existence of the outlaw. It may be as well, father, to warn him not to betray to Falcone that my daughter yet lives. Since he believes that she perished, let him remain in that delusion. It will be best for all parties concerned."</p> 
                
               <p>"And will you conceal from the countess the fact of his escape from the assassins?"</p> 
               <p>"Of course; what good could be accomplished by telling her that Falcone yet lives? She has ceased to care for him, and her whole heart is devoted to Evoli."</p> 
               <p>"Yet my mind strangely misgives me, my son."</p> 
               <p>"Silence its misgivings, then," replied Ernesti, imperiously. "I only act for the best. If Falcone stood before her to-day, Clarice would refuse to return with him. She has adapted herself to her new position with a facility that is quite wonderful; and even if her passion for Evoli could be set aside, she would repudiate the thought of giving up her fortune and the luxury she loves, to return to that mountain den, to be drugged again by those jealous women. But if she were weak enough to think of such a sacrifice, I would oppose it at the risk of my life. Understanding this, father, you see your duty clearly before you."</p> 
               <p>"Not so clearly, I am afraid," replied the priest, gloomily; "but I will do the best that lies in my power. The happiness and well-being of the countess are my first care, and such precautions as will secure these I will cheerfully take. The rest we must leave to Him who rules our fate."</p> 
               <p>Father Gregory saw Clarice and her lover together, and his heart failed him as he saw how deeply enthralled she was by this new passion, and thought that another lived whose claims upon her no human laws could set aside; for the good priest was one of those rigid interpreters of Scripture who believe that not even the Pope has power to unloose the bonds assumed in the name of God himself. Yet he had not the courage to speak, and set the whole truth before her. Why should he mar her dream of bliss? Guilio was dead to her, her heart had found its true master, and the brilliant future beckoned her onward with gay promise of triumphant prosperity. Then let her bask<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6335-00000193"/> in its beams; his should not be the hand to dash the sparkling cup of joy from her lips.</p> 
               <p>The marriage was to take place in the following month at Ernesti Castle, and a brilliant party of friends was invited to accompany the count and his daughter on their return there.</p> 
               <p>To Clarice the hours sped by on wings of light. The whirl of social life was varied by delicious ttes--ttes with her betrothed, and together they visited every spot of interest in the vicinity of the Eternal City. A magnificent trousseau was ordered, and Clarice indulged her taste in selecting gems of art with which to decorate her future home. Evoli approved of all she did and said, and with them all went "merry as a marriage bell."</p> 
               <p>Evoli was truly and passionately enamored of her, and no qualm of conscience came to check his rapture, even when he thought of all he had done to gain her. He possessed one of those natures to which remorse is unknown, and with the skill of an adept in sophistry, he convinced himself that his treachery toward Guilio was a necessity imposed on him by fate. By the sacrifice of his rival he had saved one far more worthy to live, and thus he considered the account fairly balanced.</p> 
               <p>At present there was only room in his heart for one thought. This exquisite creature loved him entirely, devotedly. He felt assured that the love he had inspired was as different from the tender regard she once felt for Guilio, as the full blaze of the noon-tide sun is from the pale scintillations of a star; and day by day, hour by hour, this passion grew with the sweet aliment it fed on, till Clarice felt that to lose him would be to die to all that made life beautiful.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE RAGE OF THE WRONGED HUSBAND.</head> 
               <p>THROUGH the manuvres of Madame Villeray, the marriage of Vivaldi and her daughter was postponed from month to month, but at last he bore his bride to a villa by the sea-side, belonging to a wealthy and eccentric friend, who was absent on a distant tour. Embosomed in groves of orange, myrtle and laurel, the house stood in deep seclusion, overlooking the blue waters that spread away in the distance. The walls were covered with masses of ivy, and flowers bloomed on every side. In this enchanting spot the first halcyon days of their union were passed; the newly wedded pair brought no one with them except Marie Montoni, who, by her misfortunes and her gentleness, had won deeply on the affections of both.</p> 
               <p>To the tender entreaties of Lucille, the improvisatrice had yielded, and given up her wanderings to become a life-long resident with her. When the tragedy at the cavern had been related to Marie, and the flight of Clarice to the protection of her father became a certainty, she relinquished all thought of returning thither, though her heart yearned vaguely to ascertain every particular concerning the fate of the unhappy Guilio. That he was dead she believed in common with the rest of his friends, for every effort had been made by the inhabitants of the cavern to conceal his continued existence.</p> 
               <p>Fate had now brought her near the spot on which she had left him happy in the affection of her he had so fondly loved, and Marie formed a resolution to visit the cave, and learn from Angelo and his wife the history of what had actually occurred. On the morning on which she intended<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6335-00000194"/> to set out on her clandestine journey, Vivaldi invited her to join himself and Lucille in a visit to a grotto they had not yet explored, which was situated in the grounds of a neighboring villa. Marie could offer no excuse for refusing to accompany them, and she set out with the intention of disappearing at some opportune moment, and starting on her proposed pilgrimage.</p> 
               <p>The grotto had been recently discovered, and was pronounced a marvel of beauty. They passed through orange groves loaded with yellow fruit, and gathered clusters of purple grapes at the invitation of a young peasant girl, who acted as cicerone. When they reached the entrance, the girl lighted a swinging lamp, and left them to explore the interior at their leisure.</p> 
               <p>The faint light illuminated a fairy temple of exquisite grace and beauty, in which were represented pointed arches, massive capitals, tabernacles and rosettes, such as above ground are only found among the elaborate inventions of Gothic architecture. In the centre was a figure, which required little effort of the imagination to believe was the form of a woman with a white veil thrown over her person, and a crown of flowers upon her head. Four smaller figures kneeled near her, with hands stretched out as if in supplication.</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi and his companions paused in front of this, and commented upon the singular grace of the veiled lady. The faint light fell over it, and all beyond lay in deep shadow. Suddenly Marie said:</p> 
               <p>"We are not the only visitors here. Some one is crouching behind this group."</p> 
               <p>"I will soon see who it is," replied Vivaldi. "Stand quite still, till I light the lamp that hangs on this side. Why do you tremble, Lucille? there is nothing to fear."</p> 
               <p>He took a small match-box from his pocket, and drawing it sharply against its side, the flame flared up, and in another second the broad glare of the lamp flashed over the prostrate form of a man, who lay wrapped in the deep sleep of exhaustion, and whose emaciated person showed that he was suffering from ill health. His arm was thrown upward in such a manner as partially to conceal his face, but Marie started forward with an exclamation, for there was something in the appearance of the sleeper that brought Guilio irresistibly to her mind.</p> 
               <p>At the sound of her voice the man started up and grasped the carbine which had fallen from his hand. He gazed upon them with an expression of bewildered surprise, and then with a wild cry threw himself toward Marie.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Marie, my heart is broken! my life is desolate. They have slain her! my love, my darling lies in her bloody grave, and I-<emph>I</emph> live to tell it to you! Oh, pity me, for I need pity!"</p> 
               <p>Marie grasped his hand, she heard his voice, yet she could scarcely credit the evidence of her senses that this was indeed the living Guilio. She faintly said:</p> 
               <p>"I have believed you dead these many, many months, and another, to whom your life is more important, believes so too."</p> 
               <p>"To whom can my life be important now?" he asked, with an accent of indescribable desolation. "The angel of my life has been snatched from me by violence; and I have lost, with her, all hope, all energy. I wandered hither to gaze upon this veiled form, because I fancied that it bears a resemblance to my Clarice, wrapped in her flowing veil, when we rowed about our submarine grotto. Oh! those days are agony to remember now!" and down his wasted cheeks a tear wandered, and fell hot upon the kind hand that clasped his own.</p> 
               <p>"Who is this person?" inquired Vivaldi, in a low voice.</p> 
               <pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6335-00000195"/> 
               <p>"Senor, this is the wreck of what Guilio Falcone once was."</p> 
               <p>"The husband of my cousin? Impossible!"</p> 
               <p>At these words, Guilio turned quickly toward him.</p> 
               <p>"Then you are the heir to her wealth. You gained by her death; your presence stifles me; I must away, for we cannot breathe in the same atmosphere."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi impulsively and proudly replied:</p> 
               <p>"Her fortune is her own, I claim no portion of it."</p> 
               <p>"Her own? How can my murdered Clarice stand between you and your inheritance?"</p> 
               <p>A bewildered look passed between the three, which Guilio was quick to catch. A wild hope dawned on him. He clutched the hand of Marie with a grasp of iron, and gasped:</p> 
               <p>"What does he mean? what can he mean? Have they told me a falsehood? Have I worn out my life mourning over an empty grave? Oh, God! if my Clarice lives, why-why am I alone? Answer me on your soul; as you shall hope for mercy in your dying hour, show it to me now."</p> 
               <p>Lucille clung trembling to Vivaldi's arm; she eagerly whispered:</p> 
               <p>"Tell him, Francesco; he has the right to know all."</p> 
               <p>For an instant he was undecided, for he feared what might result from the revelation; but the lover, who had just won his own bride, could not stifle his deep compassion for this wronged and stricken man. He said:</p> 
               <p>"There has been some strange misconception here. My cousin believes you to be dead, and you have been induced to believe that she perished in the attack upon your strong hold. She escaped, and is now with her father."</p> 
               <p>A wild cry rang in startling echoes through the grotto, and Guilio fell senseless at his feet. He was removed to the villa, but when he again awoke to life his old fever returned, and weeks passed away before he recovered sufficiently to understand all that had happened. Then he had but one thought-to reclaim his lost bride, and find a new home in some foreign land where the vendetta could never reach them.</p> 
               <p>Marie watched over him with the tender care of a sister, and when he was sufficiently restored to explain to her all that had happened at the cavern, her woman's wit instantly penetrated the motive of Gulietta for concealing the safety of Clarice. She began to have painful doubts as to the willingness of her former friend to give up her new state for a life of wandering and privation with Guilio; and these were confirmed by the reply of Father Gregory to the letter of Vivaldi, which informed him that Guilio yet lived. The priest entreated him to conceal from him the continued existence of Clarice. He informed him of her approaching marriage with the Duke of Evoli; of her deep attachment to him, and the ruin to her happiness which must follow any attempt to reclaim her. The church had dissolved the tie that bound her to her first lover, and her heart had also repudiated the affection she once felt for him. Henceforth their paths lay widely apart, and they must never meet again.</p> 
               <p>How to reveal all this to Guilio was now the question, for his mind, so long clouded by grief and sickness, had regained all its clearness, and but one hope seemed to animate him-that of regaining his lost Clarice. Under the stimulus of this new hope his health rapidly mended, and once more he walked the earth with erect and firm steps. He sent for Angelo, and revealed to him his knowledge of the deception which had been practiced upon him, and commanded him to remove his family from the cavern without delay. In a few more weeks he hoped to bring back his lost love to her own home; and he desired Marie Montoni<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6335-00000196"/> to hold herself in readiness to precede her, and prepare everything for her reception.</p> 
               <p>The herdsman listened respectfully, though he knew it was useless to hurry these arrangements; he felt assured that Clarice would never again reign as Queen over the mountain, and Guilio would yet be glad to return to the friends who were faithful to him. A few words with Vivaldi confirmed this belief, and on his return he simply announced to Lisa and her daughter the safety of Guilio, and his early return to them.</p> 
               <p>One morning Guilio sought Vivaldi, and said:</p> 
               <p>"I am now strong enough to travel; I must go to Italy, and in person claim my wife. However powerful Count Ernesti may be, he cannot resist such a claim as mine. I shall leave to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi regarded him with compassion. He gently asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has it never occurred to you that my cousin may herself refuse to return to you?"</p> 
               <p>The livid pallor that overspread Guilio's face was fearful; at length he gasped:</p> 
               <p>"You are aware of something, then, that has been concealed from me. What is it? I demand it of you; I <emph>must</emph> know all, that I may be able to judge what I should do."</p> 
               <p>With deep reluctance Vivaldi related to him the contents of the priest's letter. Clarice loved another; was on the eve of marriage with a man of her own rank in life. She had been divorced from him by an especial decree of the church, and any attempt to reclaim her must end in wretchedness to all concerned.</p> 
               <p>Guilio listened with whirling brain and flashing eyes. When Vivaldi ended he asked, in a low tone:</p> 
               <p>"Does Clarice know that I yet live?"</p> 
                
               <p>"She does not; until very lately we all thought you dead, and her father deems it best that she shall still think so."</p> 
               <p>"Then shall my living lips undeceive her, and from her alone will I receive the assurance that another is preferred before me. And that one? who is he? what is he?"</p> 
               <p>"He is noble, rich, and reckless of consequences. He will have you seized and imprisoned, if you attempt to come between himself and the woman he adores."</p> 
               <p>Guilio started up with all the fire of his race blazing in his eyes. At that moment he was only the wild Corsican, ready for vengeance upon his foe, and he hissed through his shut teeth:</p> 
               <p>"Let him do it, if he can; I defy him-I spit upon him! <emph>She</emph> pledged to me her life, her blood, and I swear to take both, sooner than let another clasp her to his heart as his living bride."</p> 
               <p>He rushed from the room, and without offering his adieux to any one, left the house. When convinced that he was indeed gone, Vivaldi wrote a few hurried lines to Father Gregory, informing him of Falcone's purposes, and imploring him to prevent a scene of violence if it was possible to do so. Then, in the faint hope that his letter would arrive in time to put Count Ernesti on his guard, he went, with a heavy heart, to join Lucille and her companion.</p> 
               <p>As fate would have it, when Guilio sought at the cove for the means of embarkation, he found there the felucca of Barnardo. With what joy and surprise he was welcomed by the captain, we need not record; and he listened to his despairing cry for vengeance for his wrongs, with a degree of sympathy that surprised himself.</p> 
               <p>Barnardo had refused the offer of Evoli to employ him as agent for one of his estates; his fondness for the wild life he led was too great to permit him to immure himself in the<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6335-00000197"/> country; and in defiance of the authorities, he continued to ply his regular trade."</p> 
               <p>The journal Jacopo had engaged to send to him was received at intervals, and he was kept informed of all that occurred at Ernesti Castle, in which Clarice was interested. Though it now promised to be of little service, yet Barnardo read it with morbid curiosity to know how the count's affairs prospered, and at moments a kind of savage hatred arose in his heart at the thought that after all Ernesti would triumph in the restoration of his daughter, and her marriage with a man of high rank.</p> 
               <p>This feeling was predominant when Guilio suddenly appeared before him as one risen from the dead. Barnardo really liked him; believed that he had been basely deceived, and he quickly resolved to place in his hands details that must exasperate him to frenzy. Guilio read every word of the journal with a burning heart, and a resolution that never faltered in its purpose. Barnardo concealed from him the identity of Benedetto and Evoli; he left that for the future to reveal, calculating on the effect of the discovery to give fatal impulse to the blow he knew was resolved on.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A STORM BURSTS, AND THE VENDETTA IS ACCOMPLISHED.</head> 
               <p>A SELECT party of friends assembled at Ernesti Castle to witness the bridal of the beautiful heiress. The appointed day dawned amid threatening clouds, with that oppressive stillness in the atmosphere which always heralds the approach of a storm of unusual violence; yet the hours passed on, and it did not burst. It was hoarding its wrath for a final explosion, which should scatter desolation in its track, and leave death behind it.</p> 
               <p>Clarice, who was the child of sunshine, was vividly susceptible to the changes in the atmosphere, and she had almost a childish dread of lightning. For the first time for many weeks, a depression she could not shake off rendered her restless and miserable. Even the arrival of Evoli and a gay party of his friends, could scarcely enliven her. He brought with him his family diamonds, reset for her use, and requested that she would adorn herself with them on that night. Among them was a starry wreath, twined in the form of a coronet, as the insignia of the new rank she was about to assume, and the love of splendor innate with her, was gratified by this princely gift. She examined it with eager delight, tried its effect, and for a few moments forgot her depression. But when the excitement of meeting her betrothed passed away, she relapsed into the vague feeling of restless dread that haunted her, in spite of her efforts to shake it off.</p> 
               <p>Late in the evening she sought Father Gregory in his own sanctum; she came to him to make her last confession before the sacrament of marriage, and the priest received her with even more tender interest than usual, for when she came in, he held in his hand the hurried letter of Vivaldi, informing him of Falcone's resolution to regain her, even by force.</p> 
               <p>There was yet time to baffle the designs of the madman; but Clarice must learn the cruel position she held between these two men; both madly enamored of her; both claiming her as his lawful wife; yet Father Gregory dared not speak, and show her the precipice on which she stood.</p> 
               <p>Her confession was soon made, and then the old man, in a voice that vibrated with emotion, said:</p> 
               <p>"My daughter, if Guilio could arise from the dead, and<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6335-00000198"/> insist that you should return to him, what would be your own decision?"</p> 
               <p>She grew deadly pale, then flushed crimson, as she replied:</p> 
               <p>"I am wedded in soul, life, and spirit to Evoli. The love I once felt for Guilio was that of an inexperienced child. This is the passion of the woman who has staked her every hope in life upon its object. The rank and fortune of my betrothed I do not undervalue; but they are trifles in comparison with himself, for he is dear to me as the life-blood that warms my heart."</p> 
               <p>"I am answered, my dear child, and I trust-I trust that you will find happiness with him."</p> 
               <p>"Who doubts it, father? Yet I have had a strange presentiment of approaching evil throughout all the hours of this weary day. I believe, after all, that it springs from a weird dream I had last night, which left so vivid an impression upon me that I cannot shake it off."</p> 
               <p>"Relate it, my daughter. I may be able to interpret its meaning, as I have been thought to have some skill in that way."</p> 
               <p>After a moment's thought; Clarice said:</p> 
               <p>"I slept very little last night. Toward morning, I fell into a sort of waking trance, for I scarcely think that consciousness entirely deserted me. I seemed to be carried back to the days of the crusades, and I saw an Eastern scene stretching before me. The tents of two opposing hosts dotted a vast plain, and in the distance, the minarets of a Moslem city arose against the transparent sky.</p> 
               <p>"Then came the clash of battle; the infidels were overthrown, their city taken, and delivered over to pillage. I followed a knight of lofty stature who had been conspicuous in the fray. He entered, with others, into a palace filled with women and children. Death followed on their track, and the arm of this stalwart knight was raised against a defenceless woman. He stabbed her three times upon her breast, making a mark exactly similar to the one I bear upon my person. With her last breath, she shrieked:</p> 
               <p>"'My blood shall cling to you and yours. It shall curse your descendants, the last of whom shall perish by the hand of God himself.' It was strange that, although the woman spoke in a language unknown to me, the interpretation of her words came to me by that kind of magic known only to dreams."</p> 
               <p>The priest listened with absorbing interest. He said:</p> 
               <p>"Go on, my daughter. How did the vision end?"</p> 
               <p>"That scene passed away, and the cell of an astrologer was next visible. The same knight received from a venerable-looking man a scroll on which some Greek characters were traced, which I could not decipher, but I heard the words of the soothsayer. He said:</p> 
               <p>"'Conceal this prediction, for while it rests in oblivion your house shall last. When it is brought to light, its greatness shall pass away as a shadow, and be no more.'</p> 
               <p>"Then a long procession of my dead and buried ancestors passed slowly before me, and each one whispered as he glided by me: 'We claim you as one of ourselves-prepare to join our ghostly ranks, for the death-feast is made ready.' Was not this a frightful vision, father, to come to a bride on the eve of her marriage?"</p> 
               <p>The good priest possessed as little superstition as belongs to most men, but this ominous dream caused the cold drops to gather upon his brow. He hurriedly said:</p> 
               <p>"Your mind is full of fancies, my daughter, and you read too much nonsense. Think no more of this vision. Be happy while you may, and do not permit so intangible a thing as a dream to affect your spirits."</p> 
               <p>"Then you think it has no significance? Oh, I am so<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6335-00000199"/> happy that you do, for it has been a weight upon my heart all day. Yes, I will forget it; I will be hopeful again."</p> 
               <p>"That will be best, my daughter; and now I must dismiss you with my blessing, for I have business with the Count that must be attended to."</p> 
               <p>Clarice retired to the duties of the toilette, her heart a little lightened by the words of the old man, and Father Gregory immediately sought the Count, and placed the letter of Vivaldi in his hands.</p> 
               <p>Such precautions were immediately taken as Ernesti felt assured must ensure the arrest of Guilio if he attempted to penetrate into the castle; and he insisted that the knowledge that he yet lived should be kept from Clarice at all hazards. But he had a foe more wily than himself to deal with, and he forgot that the hunted outlaw would probably prove subtle enough to evade his best planned measures for security.</p> 
               <p>The chapel had been decorated for the ceremony much against the will of the Count, for he too well remembered the scene once enacted there, and the ghastly secret its walls enclosed, to be willing to make it the scene of a festivity; but in this Clarice had been wilful, and she declared that only before its altar would she be married at all. Her father yielded, as he did to all her caprices, and the walls were decorated with myrtle and orange boughs, and the pillars wreathed with vines from the forest. Banners, which had been borne in many a battle's front by gallant knights, bearing the name of the Ernesti, were draped above the altar, and on it burned the consecrated candles.</p> 
               <p>The chapel was one blaze of light, and at every entrance an armed man was placed with strict orders to permit no stranger to enter on pain of his own life. Too late had these precautions been taken. Crouching behind the folds of an immense flag, on which a red cross was embroidered, was a hollow-eyed phantom, in whose veins the fires of rage and insanity were burning. The wound on Guilio's head predisposed him to madness, and the terrible mental suffering through which he had passed had now completed their work. He was in that state of mind which stops at nothing, however fearful might be the results that would flow from carrying out his scheme of vengeance. He comprehended the drift of the preparations making, and panting like an enraged tiger about to spring upon its prey, he awaited the entrance of the bridal party.</p> 
               <p>Mutterings of thunder, reverberated from the distant mountain peaks, were heard at intervals, and the arrowy flashes of lightning which were seen even through the illumination within, showed that the storm was gathering in its fury, and would soon burst over the castle. But Guilio heeded it not-the storm that raged in his heart was wilder and fiercer than any strife of the elements could become.</p> 
               <p>He waited for the appearance of the bridal cortge to make his presence known; then it was his purpose to spring forward and bear away his bride, or strike her to the heart if she resisted him. He watched with feverish agony for the sounds that would herald her approach, and although he knew that Clarice was willingly giving her hand to another, he did not for an instant doubt that, when once assured that he yet lived, she would bound to his arms, and cling to him in defiance of every effort made to separate them.</p> 
               <p>There was a murmur of voices, sounds of triumphant music, and a dazzling array of pride and splendor poured into the ancient chapel. A bevy of young girls strewed flowers before the fair bride, who came forward radiant in white, resplendent with jewels, which flashed from every fold of her magnificent dress.</p> 
               <p>But her face was all that Guilio saw, and the expression of pride and joy that now rested on it struck coldly to his<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6335-00000200"/> heart. What if she really loved his rival? and his fiery glance fell upon the splendid bridegroom, who looked as if the crowning triumph of his life had been just attained.</p> 
               <p>A cry of savage wrath arose, but at that instant the long delayed storm burst with terrific violence; the thunder crashed in rapid reverberations, accompanied by flashes of lightning so vivid as to pale the light of the lamps within the chapel, and Guilio's cry was lost amid the increasing strife of the elements. He stood breathless and panting, his brain whirling so violently that he felt himself incapable of moving or speaking.</p> 
               <p>They arranged themselves in front of the altar, and the voice of Father Gregory, tremulous and uncertain, commenced the ceremony. Clarice clung trembling to the arm of Evoli, for the fierce storm that raged without filled her with fear. Suddenly a wild form bounded into the midst of the group, waving aloft a gleaming dagger, which he aimed at the heart of Evoli, as he shouted:</p> 
               <p>"False friend, base deceiver, take that as the reward of your treachery. Clarice, I yet live! Come back to me, for you are mine, <emph>mine.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Evoli rapidly parried the blow aimed at his life, and the reply of Clarice to this appeal, was to throw herself in his arms as if for protection from him who so madly loved her. At this, with a howl of rage, Guilio struck wildly at her breast, resolute to fulfil his threat that living she should never become the bride of another.</p> 
               <p>At that instant the castle shook to its foundation-there was a stunning crash, a blinding glare of lightning, and the wall of the chapel was shivered. A mass of stone fell forward, and with it a skeleton rattled to the feet of the Count. A pale blue flame seemed to play around the group before the altar; and each point of the starry crown worn by the bride glittered in its phosphorescent rays.</p> 
                
               <p>Falcone was struck down senseless, and all were stunned; when they recovered sufficiently to note what was passing around them, they saw Evoli and the priest sprinkling water over the pale face of Clarice, endeavoring to restore life to her. Alas! all their efforts were vain. The last of the Ernesti had perished in her youth, and the wretched father was left to end his days in the solitude of a monastic life. The long-suspended curse was consummated, and all that now remained to him was to consecrate the remnant of his existence to penitence and prayer.</p> 
               <p>Guilio was taken to an asylum for lunatics, where he was cared for at Barnardo's expense during the few remaining months of his life. Evoli mourned the loss of Clarice with passionate sorrow, and in an active career he sought to drive the memory of the past from his heart. He devoted his life to the elevation of his country, and among the most distinguished of Italian patriots is to be found his name.</p> 
               <p>Vivaldi gained his inheritance, and with his fair Lucille he is happy. Marie Montoni has found with them a permanent asylum; and in devotion to Lucille's lovely children she has ceased to pine for the freedom of the wanderer's life.</p> 
               <p>Gulietta accepted a consoler for the loss of Guilio, in the person of Barnardo, who found the cavern a convenient place of refuge for himself, and a safe receptacle for his contraband wares. She and her mother reign over the mountain fastnesses, which still continue to be a refuge to the hunted outlaw.</p>
