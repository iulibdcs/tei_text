                  <p>COMMENCING this first chapter, I hesitate an instant; the theme long drifting
                     through my imagination with such lively aspect, begins to take a doubtful hue;
                     its clear outline and vivid colors pale. The canvas waits—the palette is
                     prepared—but the subject has grown for a moment sadly vague and shadowy.</p>
                  <p>An unfortunate theme I have chosen, I fear, though my dearest thoughts are in
                     it. Who will take interest in the story of a beggar-girl? A mere beggar
                     girl—beginning the life of degradation which all her progenitors had lived
                     before her. What prosperous, well-to-do soul will care to dwell on the record
                     of this dull, stupid, half-brutalized waif of humanity? What innocent,
                     thoughtless, blithe-hearted girl, seeking to while away an idle hour in the
                     fairy realms of fancy, will patiently turn over these pages, and pronounce them
                     either interesting or amusing?</p>
                  <p>Yet, is she not one with us? one of that wonderful type—that human problem
                     which we hold, as it were, in perpetual trust for solution.</p>
                  <p>How complacently we look down from our superior hight upon such as she! We
                     pity, to be sure, but we try to forget. Why dwell upon such very unpleasant
                     subjects? These poor objects, doomed to their misery, have always been—and, we
                     may infer, must always be. So we pass heedlessly on, silencing the deep
                     intuitions that seek for voice—that would urge us from our indolence to the
                     rescue of humanity. We turn aside these instinctive emotions, soothing their
                     persistent cry <choice>
                        <sic>witht he</sic>
                        <corr>with the</corr>
                     </choice> lip-service of ordinary commiseration. Oh, poor <choice>
                        <sic>creaures</sic>
                        <corr>creatures</corr>
                     </choice>, miserable unfortunates! we do, indeed feel for them; but let them
                     alone—they are, it may be, quite as happy in their unreasoning ignorance, as we
                     in all the pride of our boasted knowledge. Happy! yes, that is the word—as if
                     individual happiness either present or prospective were the sum of life—the
                     great end and aim of all these rare endowments, these wonderful capacities of
                     our common nature, that almost, in their vast resources, ally us to the
                     Infinite.</p>
                  <p>We would not say to the block of unchiselled marble, "Lie there! it is as well.
                     Let not cunning hands guided by genius disturb thy quiet, or revel in the
                     beauties they may unfold. The attainments of exquisite art, that fill the soul
                     with enthusiasm, aiding its struggle toward the highest ideal—we can be happy
                     without these." Neither should we say to any soul striving to chisel its way
                     out of its surrounding circumstances, "Rest as you are. Be satisfied. Let not
                     this craving desire, this thirst for knowledge disentomb you from your safe
                     obscurity. In the darkness of ignorance you can be happy!" No: rather should we
                     seek to stimulate these qualities, these universal gifts; drawing them forth to
                     their utmost bounds, and to their broad<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC5590-00000003"/>
                     est and most universal application. Let it be our highest ambition, our highest
                     desire to have the world wiser, better, more lovingly disposed, for our being
                     one of its number.</p>
                  <p>But poor Leil, our beggar-girl, there she sits, all unconscious of the world's
                     deliberations, on the low step of a gateway opening into the extensive grounds
                     of a fine suburban residence. The day was cheerless and cold. Dark and somber
                     clouds hung low in the dense atmosphere, as though burdened with their frosty
                     load.</p>
                  <p>A few flakes of snow had already fallen, whitening the topmost branches of tree
                     and shrub within that pleasant enclosure, and throwing out more clearly defined
                     against the lowering sky, the pointed gables and turrets of the handsome
                     mansion which it surrounded. The gently falling snow now <choice>
                        <sic>sprinked</sic>
                        <corr>sprinkled</corr>
                     </choice> also, with impartial hand, the scanty garments of the girl, as she
                     sat on the stone step without.</p>
                  <p>We would trust that she did not feel the biting air as would the more favored
                     child of fortune. Our needs and susceptibilities are greatly hightened by
                     indulgent circumstances, what becomes a necessity to one is a luxury to
                     another. We have heard of two young Scotch lads, who earned a very precarious
                     subsistence by ferrying a light skiff across one of the picturesque lakes that
                     abound in the beautiful highlands of Scotland; carrying over their clear waters
                     any stray wanderer who might, either for pleasure or from necessity be
                     traversing these lonely mountains. Rich they were, these lads, in the wealth of
                     nature's surrounding loveliness, but poor, pitifully poor in the material
                     bounties by which she more directly appeals to the young and robust. Their
                     healthy appetites often outran their supplies, and as a matter <choice>
                        <sic>of of</sic>
                        <corr>of</corr>
                     </choice> course these unsatisfied desires occupied much of their thoughts, and
                     formed the theme of many, alas, to them visionary speculations.</p>
                  <p>"Do ye ken," said the eldest of the two, starting from the recumbent position
                     in which he had been resting on the bow of the boat, now moored in a quiet
                     little inlet, "Do you ken what I wud hae, were I a great and grand king?"</p>
                  <p>Of course the other was entirely at fault—could not be expected to follow the
                     inflations of so exalted an imagination. He at once declared his inability to
                     even venture a guess. "Weel, then!" said the triumphant enthusiast, "I'll tell
                     it ye! I would hae cream porridge whene'er I likit, aye days, as weel as
                     Sundays and holidays!"</p>
                  <p>"Whew!" exclaimed the eager listener, with rather a sneer of contempt, "is that
                     all? Why, man, I would not only hae cream porridge when I likit, but I would
                     hae cream til it!"</p>
                  <p>So, with our Leil, a few luxuries went a great way; in the multitude of her
                     exposures, a shaded corner was one of them, and in the limited nature of her
                     supplies the poor scraps beside her were a feast. She was not, at any rate,
                     over fastidious in the gratification of her appetite; at least so thought the
                     youth just then passing, for he suddenly stopped, and gazed with a shuddering
                     horror on those fingers shaped as his own, in their eager search for the choice
                     bits in that heterogeneous mass of scraps and ends of cast-off food that lay in
                     the filthy, unsightly basket by her side.</p>
                  <p>At any other time this very young man, occupied with his own purposes, would
                     have hastened on, forgetting at the next step that such a being had ever
                     shadowed his way. But now he paused and stood transfixed, as if held by some
                     strange fascination, looking down at her with a mingled feeling of loathing and
                     deepest commiseration.</p>
                  <p>"Poor thing!" he muttered, "oh, poor, poor thing! this is too dreadful!"</p>
                  <p>Apparently the girl did not heed his presence, for she did not even raise her
                     eyes to look at him, but continued busily intent on her loathsome
                     occupation.</p>
                  <p>Still the young man kept muttering, "Poor thing? poor thing! oh, that I could
                     do something for her!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey Luperthorp was a tender-hearted young fellow, with a natural vein of
                     sympathy running through his kindly disposition position. He knew that there
                     was suffering and destitution, at least he had been told so, and his young
                     heart had melted at the recital; but circumstances had never thrust the actual
                     presence of want in his way, and he had come to think of it as a thing afar
                     off—a kind of myth. Beside, he had associated with the idea of poverty a sort
                     of ferocity, a dogged resistance, as if to some supposed oppression; to see it
                     thus, enduring without a struggle, he was not prepared; it was a singular
                     revelation to him. And then he began ingeniously to administer some consolation
                     to his wounded sensibilities by whispering to these silent thoughts:</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps, now, she is not altogether human. I mean," he added, half
                     apologetically, even to himself, "I mean in its fullest sense—does she feel and
                     suffer as I and others do?" And then came the dim remembrance of arguments he
                     had heard long ago—learned arguments, concerning differences of blood—of the
                     patrician and plebian, with all their distinguishing traits—might there not,
                     after all, be something in this? "At any rate," thought he, "I would like to
                     know more of this girl. I wonder who, or what she is?"</p>
                  <p>Alas, poor unfortunate, there was little about her to answer this momentous
                     doubt as to her kinship with the great family of humanity. Her features were
                     coarse, hanging and listless. No momentary gleaming of youthful vivacity lit up
                     that meaningless face, no intelligence of thought, even in twilight glimmer,
                     transferred the impression of soul to soul. All was vague and stolid, save that
                     instinctive eagerness to satisfy a present desire, which is common to both
                     animals and man.</p>
                  <p>Her form, too, presented a strange anomaly. It seemed even less human than her
                     face, as she sat there doubled up in that miserable excuse for a covering. Poor
                     child! the wind now rising, came in fitful gusts around the sides of the tall
                     house; it swept across the frozen lawn, gathering in eddies around the
                     shivering girl, and wafting in wilder mazes the light flurry of snow which was
                     rapidly falling.</p>
                  <p>"Are you very cold?" said the young man, half roused from his reverie, and
                     addressing somewhat abruptly the object of his speculations.</p>
                  <p>His voice sounded kindly, I suppose, to the girl, for she looked up with
                     something of a surprised and curious expression. The glance must have satisfied
                     her, for she at the same time smiled, a pleasant, natural smile, shaking her
                     head negatively in answer.</p>
                  <p>In an instant the youth felt that all his doubts and questionings were
                     answered. It is only the human face that smiles. In that brief illumination,
                     lighting up for an instant those otherwise uninteresting features, the answer
                     came spontaneous and free. Through that witching freemasonry the pass of
                     fellowship was given, and he could not but recognise her as one of the great
                     family of his kind.</p>
                  <p>But this smile soon passed off as a vapor of the morning mist; for when he
                     spoke a second time, a frown, dark, impatient and angry rested upon her
                     countenance, and words sharp and severe—even something like an oath, sounded in
                     his ear.</p>
                  <p>She was becoming impatient of his protracted scrutiny. She could not understand
                     what it meant, at all. There were stories, fearful, terrible, rife among her
                     companions, about young men dressed as gentlemen who were so awfully
                     wicked—perhaps this was one of them. And she began to feel some fear—as much as
                     her stupidity would allow. What if he should carry her off, as Nellie Crinkle
                     had told her they sometimes did poor girls? She felt to throw something at him,
                     or even scream loud enough to be heard by the folks on top of the hill! Her
                     misgivings were by no means lessened when in her stealthy observation of the
                     stranger, she perceived that his eyes though fixed intently, seemed to look
                     through rather than at her, as if through her squalor, her rags, her very flesh
                     and bones, he pondered something beyond. What a strange look! Was he crazy?
                     What <emph>should</emph> she do?</p>
                  <p>Poor wretch! she could not follow him in those far off speculations that
                        were<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5590-00000004"/> floating vision-like before the
                     abstracted gaze which to her seemed only portentous of evil.</p>
                  <p>It was rather a strange mood for such a youth, and its novelty, perhaps, caused
                     him to linger. But, as I have said, he was by nature tender-hearted, and was
                     now really interested, and in much perplexity. Why were these things so? Why
                     this utter degradation—this ignorance—this semi-brutishness of so many of
                     earth's children? Alas! Wiser heads, and more profound than his have propounded
                     such queries, and still they remain unanswered.</p>
                  <p>Some pass through life on the soft, beaten sand of the broad highway, with head
                     erect—strong in themselves. There are no rude obstacles to trip them up; the
                     unobstructed sunshine and healthful breezes sweep all impurities from their
                     path. But others—their way leads down the weary steeps—the bye-paths of
                     life—among perilous rocks, where the footing is uncertain; and in the slippery
                     descent they faint and stumble, and stumble again, till hopeless and helpless
                     they fall over the precipice, and rest forsaken in the depth beneath.</p>
                  <p>Still we applaud or condemn, thinking little of the circumstances that govern
                     success or failure. We recognise deformities of the body, and understand why
                     those thus afflicted are weak and feeble, and incapable of full action. But we
                     cannot so readily apprehend the subtle deformities of these higher and more
                     intricate malformations—these nerves and sensations—tracing their inflammations
                     and choked up channels, that may throb with maddened impulse, or may lie inert,
                     diseased and sluggish, without controlling energy. So, we judge and pass
                     sentence, as we think, righteously; but God only knows how blindly.</p>
                  <p>But our young friend was scarcely involved in this metaphysical labyrinth. He
                     was puzzled: there was a real, tangible object before him, appealing to all his
                     finer sympathies for help—but how was he to give her that help? He might, to be
                     sure, hand her a little money; but then she would still be the same grovelling
                     thing. He wanted to get her out of that. A strange feeling had for the moment
                     come over him, as if he realized truly the full human relationship, and as if
                     he were disgraced, as he might be were a sister, or a near friend in such
                     degrading humiliation.</p>
                  <p>"But pshaw!" he suddenly exclaimed, endeavoring to throw off this weighty
                     incubus, "What does this mean?" What am I dreaming about? I never felt so
                     uncomfortable in all my life, and I do believe I make the girl uncomfortable
                     too, at least she looks so,—and what can I do? I had better be off!" With this
                     determination he turned on his heel, and walked quickly away in the direction
                     of the city. But he had scarcely gone a dozen yards, when his steps were
                     arrested by a fearful scream, and, turning, he beheld, to his amazement, the
                     young girl he had just left, inside the gate, struggling with an immense dog
                     that had sprung upon her as she entered.</p>
                  <p>A few hasty steps, and with a bound over the low railing he was by her side,
                     when a well-directed blow from his stout young arm sent the ferocious mastiff
                     whirling and spinning over the frost-crusted turf. The girl now fastened on him
                     with a frenzied tenacity, screaming with all the power of a pair of stout
                     lungs. What was he to do? The danger, it appeared, was not all over. The dog
                     was furious with rage, and evidently preparing for another attack. There was
                     not a stick or stone which the young man could lay his hand on, and the girl
                     was still clinging in his way. Begging her most earnestly to retreat behind
                     him, he braced himself, unarmed, for the encounter. On came the dog, and as he
                     was just preparing to make a desperate lunge, a man came rushing through the
                     gate, shouting,</p>
                  <p>"Stop! Don't hurt the dog! Stop, stop!"</p>
                  <p>"Don't hurt the dog!" repeated Geoffrey, turning angrily, "Is this girl to be
                     worried by that odious brute, and you dare to stand by, and tell me not to hurt
                     the dog?"</p>
                  <p>He now saw that this man was the coachman, who had driven a vehicle up to the
                     sidewalk, just as he, throwing off his musing fit, started away. Exasperated
                     that the fellow had not interfered before, he continued, wrathfully, "It is
                     infamous, most infamous to keep such a dog about! He ought be shot on the spot.
                     It is a shame and disgrace to frighten such poor creatures in this way!"</p>
                  <p>"But that is what he is kept for," said the man, doggedly, "All such stragglers
                     must keep off the place."</p>
                  <p>"And you dare to vindicate such cruelty!" cried the youth, in a transport of
                     passion, which was greatly hightened by the appearance of blood on the face and
                     hands of the frightened girl, "Take back your words, you mean, cowardly wretch!
                     Take back your words, or one of us must suffer the consequences!" And so
                     determined was his demeanor, and strong his indignation, that as he approached
                     in menacing attitude, the man, athletic though he was, involuntarily drew back
                     before his slight and boyish adversary.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, a collision was checked which must necessarily have ended
                     disastrously to our young champion, by the unexpected appearance of a fair
                     young girl, wrapped in warm furs, as if prepared for a journey on this cold and
                     wintry morning. She had come round the house and down the broad pathway, and
                     was close upon them before they knew of her approach.</p>
                  <p>Poor Geoffrey! he was covered with confusion to be caught in such pugilistic
                     attitude. He would have been glad to sink into the earth. Stammering something
                     like an apology, he excused his presence there, though hardly knowing what he
                     said. But the young lady's manner quite reassured him, it was so considerate
                     and affable. There was no allusion to what she had seen—indeed he began to hope
                     that by some strange freak of vision, she had not seen anything! And then she
                     was so kind,—so much interested in the poor, wounded girl, and so indignant.
                     What a shame! She had always told papa and mamma that Jowler would do some
                     mischief yet, he was so surly and cross; but we think so much of him,—"and you
                     know," she added, with much simplicity, "one is never afraid of their own
                     dog!"</p>
                  <p>And then she was so anxious to comfort Leil. Could she not do something or
                     other for her—would not Leil come into the house and have those painful
                     scratches dressed? "Oh, do come!" she urged with winning grace, "I will do
                     anything to make you feel better!"</p>
                  <p>But Leil only shook herself sulkily from that gentle touch; she seemed angry
                     with everybody and everything about the place. "Let me alone!" she cried, "Go
                     away, I want nothing!" And still holding fast to her protector's garment, she
                     relapsed into sullen silence.</p>
                  <p>There was certainly a marked contrast between these two girls. Now that Leil
                     stood up, she seemed taller and older than she had done—but they might be about
                     the same age. Yet in the amount they had lived, how incalculable was the
                     difference! In the one there was scarcely more than the mere animal
                     existence—the instinct to eat, to sleep, to keep warm. Battling stoutly to gain
                     enough for these few wants, she was hardly aware that there were any beyond
                     them In the other there was a cultivated perfection of power and expression
                     that gave promise of a large and intelligent individuality, seeing, hearing,
                     feeling with every capacity strengthened and vivified by education, whose
                     refining touch extended even to the more perfect moulding of form and feature.
                     Yes, there she stood, a beaming contrast to her human sister, whose dull
                     unconsciousness was as a mockery to all that was bright and beautiful in
                     life.</p>
                  <p>There was no aspiration to emanate from, no inspiration to enter into that
                     nerveless, opaque brain. She was like an embryo plant forced in an ungenial
                     soil, with no welcoming breath to nourish its growth, no dewy moisture to swell
                     the tender fibre of stem and leaf, no soft sunshine to quicken with light and
                     heat the impulses feebly working in the mysterious laboratory of its life; it
                     withers and dies, a sort of nondescript<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5590-00000005"/>
                     descript, and a monstrosity, with all its tendencies toward beauty of form and
                     tint undeveloped, and the sweet odors whose promise lay deep in the heart of
                     its ungrown nature, utterly unknown.</p>
                  <p>But why keep this fair girl waiting? The morning air is sharp, and the snow is
                     still lightly falling; but if we should judge from the rich blood mounting to
                     that young face we might fancy that even the elements combined to foster her
                     perfections. The keen, frosty air which chilled the ill-nourished blood of the
                     shivering beggar, planting the seeds of pain and disease to be reaped
                     hereafter, only brought a warmer glow, a renewed vitality to the favored child
                     of fortune, adding a brighter bloom to her unsurpassed loveliness.</p>
                  <p>But she must go; the surly Leil would not receive any of her services, neither
                     would she go into the house to be cared for. No! she wanted to get home—she
                     hated them all—and the dog too. So finding all her offers of assistance thus
                     rudely repelled, the young lady reluctantly turned to leave.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey managed to reach the gate, and opened it wide for her to pass, though
                     he still felt painfully shy and awkward. He offered to take the few books she
                     held in her arms, but she preferred to give them to the coachman, and with a
                     smile, and thanks, and a pleasant "Good morning," she entered the carriage and
                     was soon whirled out of sight.</p>
                  <p>Then it seemed to him, as she vanished, as if a sudden darkness had spread over
                     the earth. His eyes had been dazzled by that vision of light, and now all
                     seemed blackness. Who was she? Would he ever see her again? And where was she
                     going? He remembered that parcel of books—surely she could not be a mere
                     school-girl! There was too much of an air of "finish" about her for that. He
                     began to feel quite old and manly himself, and was sure he would not have been
                     so charmed had she anything of that sort. And straightening himself up to his
                     full hight, he began to count the weeks and months that must <choice>
                        <sic>elaspe</sic>
                        <corr>elapse</corr>
                     </choice> before he was twenty. Twenty: that was not so very young. If he could
                     be once out of those odious teens, then he would go ahead bravely.</p>
                  <p>But by this time he had forgotten Leil, who had followed him quietly out of the
                     gate, and was now dodging his footsteps unnoticed, with her eyes intently fixed
                     on him. She was afraid he would leave her.</p>
                  <p>As his cogitations closed, he was moving off, all unconscious of her vicinity,
                     when she caught hold of him with a wild cry of expostulation:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, good sir, do not leave me! The dog will come again—he will, he will; And I
                     have left my basket in there! Oh, take me with you! do, oh, do!"</p>
                  <p>The young man saw that she was almost paralyzed with fear, and was angry with
                     himself for having so far forgotten her.</p>
                  <p>"Just like me!" he said reproachfully to himself, "Just like me! A few minutes
                     ago I could not get her out of my head, and now, see how it is—if she had not
                     spoken I might have gone away, and never thought of her again!"</p>
                  <p>He tried to atone for his neglect by soothing her kindly, and assuring her that
                     he would not leave her till she was safe home. "But you have not told me where
                     your home is," he said, smilingly. She pointed to a sort of village of shanties
                     perched upon the hill just beyond them.</p>
                  <p>"Neither have you told me your name."</p>
                  <p>She looked at him now quite pleasantly, and, with a little bashfulness,
                     answered,</p>
                  <p>"My name is Leil."</p>
                  <p>"And have you any other name?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! I'm the Widow Neil's girl!"</p>
                  <p>"Then, Miss Neil," he answered, with a flourish of gallantry, "I shall be most
                     happy to escort you to your residence."</p>
                  <p>She appeared to understand that there was somewhat of a jest in this, to judge
                     by the sly look aside which she cast at him. But, nevertheless, setting hastily
                     to work, she soon had all the scattered fragments gathered into her basket,
                     when drawing her tatters around her, with a significant glance, she gave him to
                     understand that she was ready to move on.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">GALLANTRY. GEOFFREY LUPERTHORP.</head>
                  <p>IT was well, perhaps, that their way lay along an unfrequented path: for I much
                     fear our young gentleman's strength of purpose might have been severely tried,
                     had he been exposed, in such strange companionship, to the chance of meeting
                     any young and thoughtless acquaintance. Ridicule is a weapon whose sting few
                     can bear; a sharp, earnest blow from a strong arm is more endurable to a
                     sensitive nature than the slightest puncture of sarcasm.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, there was nothing to fear here. The place seemed deserted in the
                     biting air and falling snow of the early morning. He might, without much
                     stretch of the imagination, have fancied himself a hundred miles from that
                     great metropolis, now making its hasty strides and bringing its walls of stone
                     and brick almost to within call of the very woods and meadows.</p>
                  <p>Not an individual did they meet; not even a sound was heard save their own
                     footsteps, as they wended their way up the steep and narrow path leading to the
                     top of the hill.</p>
                  <p>Their progress was necessarily slow, for the girl halted and shuffled along
                     tardily. At first Geoffrey thought she was lame, but he soon discovered that
                     the uncertain gait was mainly owing to the slipshod covering of her feet, and
                     it might be some little of the stiffness resulting from cold and exposure.</p>
                  <p>At length they reached the top, and here a decidedly new state of things opened
                     to his wondering senses. It was an entirely new phase of life to the young man,
                     and its novelty was quite animating.</p>
                  <p>A group of low shanties clustered forlornly together, weather stained and
                     dilapidated—perhaps a little plot of ground before them, or a narrow pathway
                     leading to the low door. But, notwithstanding the apparently crowded state of
                     this city of poverty, there was room for the piggery, the hen-roost and the
                     goat-house—their inmates grunting, cackling, screaming—a chorus of life
                     everywhere. Geoffrey and his companion had advanced but a few steps when they
                     were met by a score of dogs, whose vociferous barking wakened the sleepy echoes
                     for miles around.</p>
                  <p>These dogs were not your rare, well-trained breeds, who prompt, proud, and
                     fully aware of their own importance, will cry for their pound of flesh like any
                     old Shylock, but receive the compliance with their demands in a nonchalant and
                     dignified manner of which that crafty Jew was incapable. These were unruly
                     curs—mixed and mongrel—noisy and rude—the very scum of dog society, as their
                     owners seemed to be of human society. Full of bluster, yet ashamed of
                     themselves withal, they came rushing out with furious onset—but a look
                     scattered them. Leil knew them well, and she dispersed them right and left with
                     ease.</p>
                  <p>But a still worse ordeal was to be passed—to run the gauntlet of
                     eyes,—wondering eyes, peering from every dingy window of the one-storied
                     cabins—staring sharply out from every crevice, every cautiously opened crack of
                     every ill-hinged door, to spy the cause of the hubbub.</p>
                  <p>One over-curious youngster, in his eagerness of investigation, suddenly pushed
                     wide open one of these doors, thereby revealing, to the indignation of those
                     concerned, three bent figures absorbed in gazing through the slight opening of
                     an ill-jointed panel.</p>
                  <p>But if our young explorer had heard the remarks and speculations on his
                     unlooked for appearance, he would have been much more disconcerted than he
                     was.</p>
                  <p>"It's a shame!" said one, "No good can come of it, I know!"</p>
                  <p>"And such an ugly thing as she is!" This was from a pert young damsel, who
                     rather prided herself on her good looks. "And I wonder where she could have
                     picked him up? Why he's a rale jintilman! Oh, dear, the sly thing! how full of
                     airs she'll be now!"</p>
                  <p>Still another romantic maiden, who had spent a short term of service as general
                     housemaid where there were a number of<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5590-00000006"/>
                     gay young ladies, suggested that it might be love at first sight, and perhaps
                     he was on his way to the widow's to settle proposals.</p>
                  <p>"Whist, yer clapper-trap!" said her sturdy mother, who was obliged to retire
                     from the window because of an obstinate baby, who would not look, or let her
                     look either. "Whist! I say, and keep yer eyes about ye, an' let me know when he
                     comes back, an' I'll jist run inter the widow's an' 'll get it all from her in
                     a twinkling. She's a poor, innocent body, like."</p>
                  <p>But happily the object of these squibs and flying reports, was blissfully
                     ignorant of the attentions he received, and quite enjoying himself looking
                     about, and watching Leil as she distributed a little here and a little there
                     from her basket to the ducks, geese and chickens crowding round her feet,
                     evidently well acquainted with her store. Poor Leil, antagonistic to almost
                     everything else, was happy and kind and gentle among these.</p>
                  <p>The snow which had fallen seemed to have relieved the clouds, for the
                     atmosphere now began to lighten up, and there was a bright look shed over the
                     little village; the lately fallen snow, pure and clean, spread like a white
                     sheet over all its unsightliness. Geoffrey began to think, after all, it might
                     not be so very uncomfortable to be poor. At least, from this outside, surface
                     view there was nothing remarkably repulsive in what he saw.</p>
                  <p>Some of the little dwellings looked quite neat: their doorways were swept, and
                     garnished with bits of old carpet on which to wipe off mud and sand. Even
                     curtains adorned a few of the windows, showing the woman's thrift and native
                     elegance. The greater number however were ruinous and neglected. Among those
                     most conspicuous stood Leil's home.</p>
                  <p>"There it is," she said curtly, pointing to one almost tumbled down in the
                     effort to maintain its standing at an angle of forty-five degrees. A woman was
                     standing outside busy with something in a tub, while a little, chubby fellow,
                     steadying himself on a tottering board across its threshold, chattered noisily
                     to her. His back was towards them, so that he did not notice their approach as
                     he exclaimed in an eager childish voice.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mudder! if I had a shillin' I'd buy you a great, big cow, with great, big
                     eyes! An' mudder, if I had two shillin'—" But what would have been the issue of
                     the last investment will never be known, for our enthusiastic young friend, in
                     great delight at this innocent exposition of golden imaginings, advancing
                     suddenly, caught up the little fellow, tossing him high in the air.</p>
                  <p>Of course there was a frightened scream, and an exclamation from the mother.
                     Her astonishment was not at all abated when turning she beheld Geoffrey,
                     accompanied by her "lazy Leil,"—the sobriquet under which that young lady was
                     known among her own friends.</p>
                  <p>Explanations were given—the widow was much obliged, and the visiter was soon
                     seated on an old turned-up box inside the shanty, with the chubby little boy on
                     his knee, proud in the possession of a real "two shillin" in either hand.</p>
                  <p>He found the widow Neil much more communicative than her daughter. But Leil was
                     not really her daughter, although the warm-hearted woman declared she was quite
                     as dear.</p>
                  <p>"She came to me a wee bit thing, an' I don't know any difference," said the
                     widow. She was now in her element—she had a listener, and a story to tell.</p>
                  <p>"Leil," said she, "go and give the children their bit, and take Bobby from the
                     gentleman's knee!"</p>
                  <p>When all were thus disposed of she proceeded.</p>
                  <p>"I remember well the night I first laid eyes on that poor thing. My good man
                     was then living—and" she sighed, wiping away a tear, a true tear from the
                     heart's sad fountain, "and a good man he was to me and mine—a decent sober man,
                     that brought his hard earnings home to his family. It was other days with me
                     then. But he was long sick, and the little we had gathered in better days had
                     to go, till ye see how I am left."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did look round, and indeed there was little to be seen. For the first
                     time he noticed how bare the place was. He had felt joyous and happy since he
                     came in, and in so much sympathy with all there, that he had not stopped to
                     consider whether he was in a hovel or a palace.</p>
                  <p>"Well, to begin," said the widow, recalling his wandering attention, "It was
                     long before this,—my good man was then alive and well,—that we were sitting at
                     our own door of an evenin'. It was bright above, that summer night, but my
                     heart was heavy and sore. I thought as the wee cloud would pass over the moon,
                     it was like that drop of sorrow in my heart. With all the light and love in it
                     for my dear man, that blackness <emph>would</emph> come over it now and again,
                     and shut him out. I had buried my first baby that day, and I could not be
                     comforted. But God is good! I had been crying, and hiding my face on my
                     husband's knee, when I looked up and saw a young thing close by, with a little
                     bit o' baby in her arms. The moon had been under one of those black, flying
                     clouds, and we had not seen her till she was close upon us. I was startled, but
                     my good man spoke up, asking what she wanted.</p>
                  <p>"'For pity, and God's sake,' says she, 'give me a night's lodging.'</p>
                  <p>"I was just going to say that we could not possibly—we had but the one bed—when
                     Patrick jumped up and took the baby from her arms, and made her sit down. He
                     had noticed, what I had not,—Heaven rest his soul!—that the poor creature was
                     faint and weary. Oh, how faint and weary! She coughed, too, as she sat there,
                     as though she must cough her life away. It was a long time before she could
                     speak. We did all we could for her. I gave her some tea and bread, and she
                     seemed to feel a little better. But ah, poor creature, it was little indeed!
                     The cruel cough and short breath gave her no peace. And she was such a
                     young-looking thing—almost a child herself. It made my heart ache.</p>
                  <p>"She made us understand that her money was all gone—that she had come a great
                     way in hopes to meet her husband—he was a sailor. But his ship had not arrived.
                     That was all she could say, and even that took a long time. My Patrick—never a
                     better man was named after the blessed saint, though its myself that says
                     it—bid me put the woman into our bed. 'I can lie anywhere,' says he.</p>
                  <p>"I felt when I laid her there that she'd never rise from it again, and so it
                     was. She lived through that night and the next day, but before the morning sun
                     rose again she was gone like the mist.</p>
                  <p>"She had kept up so long, that there wasn't strength left to keep sparrow
                     alive. She told me her husband's name was Peter Ackley, and if I ever met him
                     to tell him about the baby, and to say she loved him to the last. I doubt if he
                     was worthy of such love—to leave her, such a weakly young thing, so poorly
                     provided for—and I said so. But she would not hear it. And that's the way with
                     the poor things, always!</p>
                  <p>"I kept the baby,—surely it was God's gift, sir. And if she wasn't the sweet,
                     pretty baby my own was, she filled the empty place in my heart, where the
                     terrible pain gnawed, that I think would have killed me entirely.</p>
                  <p>"She's a good girl, Leil—I've never had cause to rue the day I took her to my
                     breast. Sometimes she's a bit surly and lazy, but on the whole she helps me a
                     power. She gathers food for the children, and takes care o' them when I get a
                     day's work out."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had listened attentively:</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever hear from her father?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Never. I had forgotten in all the confusion and fret of my mind to ask her
                     people's name; and so I could not let them know of her death, nor where the
                     child was."</p>
                  <p>"But is it possible" said he, recovering from the interest which the story had
                     excited, "Is it possible that such a great <unclear>girl</unclear> as she has
                     never been to school—does not even know her letters?"</p>
                  <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5590-00000007"/>
                  <p>"Alas! an' what could I do?" said the widow, in a deprecating tone, conscious
                     from his manner that it must be a serious matter, yet not altogether clear on
                     the subject herself, "An' what could I do? Sure I had'nt decent clothes, to say
                     nothing of shoes to put on her, an' they wouldn't let her in without 'em!"</p>
                  <p>"And hasn't she any clothes, now, fit to go to school in?"</p>
                  <p>"The good Lord have mercy on us, my young gentleman!—where would I get the
                     money to buy her clothes? As well might ye think to pick silver out of the
                     sea!"</p>
                  <p>"But I have money," exclaimed the young man, remembering, with a feeling of
                     unspeakable joy, a few gold pieces which his father had given him the evening
                     before, as a sort of monthly allowance for everyday incidental expenses. "Yes,
                     I have money! And if she had clothes could she go to school? Would you let
                     her?"</p>
                  <p>"To be sure I would! And right glad would I be to send her."</p>
                  <p>He put his hand deep down in his pocket, and drew forth five five-dollar gold
                     pieces.</p>
                  <p>"Here they are!" said he cheerfully, throwing them into the lap of the
                     astonished woman.</p>
                  <p>"All this!" she said, looking wistfully at them while the tears rolled down her
                     brown cheeks. Perhaps she was thinking of the struggles of a hard life endured
                     for want of this which he flung away so easily. "All this!" she repeated
                     dreamily.</p>
                  <p>She was a conscientious woman, and had the blessing of fair circumstances been
                     hers, would have done her part well in the world, "But, my dear young
                     gentleman," she said, turning a scrutinizing glance on the boyish face before
                     her. "Perhaps you ought not to give me all this—can you spare it?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey kindly explained to her that it was his own: that by doing without a
                     few things which he did not need in the least, he could give it to her—and it
                     would be such a pleasure to him if she would accept it.</p>
                  <p>"God bless you! God bless you!" was all she could reply.</p>
                  <p>"And you will buy some clothes for the girl, so that she can go to school,—with
                     the remainder you can do as you please. And maybe—I do not promise—but maybe
                     when that is gone I can give you more.</p>
                  <p>He would not listen to thanks. Indeed they seemed inappropriate. He was rather
                     disposed to thank her for this opening of a great pleasure—a joy and
                     exhilaration that seemed to lighten up the very air, earth and sky around him.
                     But he waited patiently to hear a few of her plans, and then left in full
                     confidence that she would do all she had promised—if not, perhaps, in the
                     wisest manner, at least to the very best of her ability.</p>
                  <p>It was, indeed, time that he should be on his way to the city. The morning was
                     far advanced, and he was a long distance from business.</p>
                  <p>He started off with accelerated speed, overstriding all obstacles, jumping over
                     embankments, overturning a toddling child or two, and causing as much
                     astonishment in his hasty departure, to the owners of those watching eyes, as
                     he had done in his first quiet and leisurely appearance before them.</p>
                  <p>Now all the gossips were sure something was the matter. It was well that the
                     widow's tumble-down shanty was not entirely upset that day with the crowd
                     dropping in one after another, oh, just to say a good mornin' to their
                     neighbor,—and wouldn't she have a bit of the butter they were just after
                     churnin'—or two or three eggs?</p>
                  <p>One went so far as actually to bring a chicken—it was all she had. The widow
                     thought that the windows of heaven were open this morning, and "poor, innocent
                     body," as she was called, they each, individually, in her overflowing
                     gratitude, got all the good news from her. Heretofore the widow had been rather
                     looked down upon in the little community, being the most abject in her poverty
                     of any of them, but now she had suddenly risen into importance.</p>
                  <p>But Geoffrey, with all his haste, had to stop a moment as he was descending the
                     hill, to look at the prospect before him. This sandbank on the very highest
                     grounds of the suburbs, commanded a fine view of the extensive city, encircled
                     with its belt of sparkling waters. The sun was now struggling through the
                     dispersing clouds, shedding a wintry gleam on the wide rivers, and away off on
                     the waters beyond; on the mist-enveloped mountains and sloping hills of the
                     far-off land, and on the lofty spires and stately edifices of the familiar city
                     lying as it were almost beneath his feet.</p>
                  <p>He was in the mood for enjoyment; his own spirit was buoyant, and everything
                     looked fair and beautiful. Even the people jostling and pressing onward as he
                     entered the busy streets, and joined the hurrying throng, had grown for the
                     time more love-able.</p>
                  <p>But a change took place in his feelings as he entered the atmosphere of his
                     daily avocations.</p>
                  <p>The office was pleasant enough, but a cold chill came over his heart; perhaps
                     it was merely the reaction after too great inflation of feeling.</p>
                  <p>As he stepped up to the stand where he usually hung his cap and overcoat, his
                     father, who was sitting near, took out his gold repeater, and opening the case
                     looked deliberately at the hands, closing it again with an energetic click.
                     This action the young man well understood as a reproof for the tardiness of his
                     arrival.</p>
                  <p>It would have been better had Mr. Luperthorp spoken, even in sharp rebuke, to
                     his son. There would then have been opportunity for explanation. But that was
                     not his way. In dealing with his child he was too apt to judge without inquiry,
                     which made his judgments oftentimes unjust, and certainly added much to his own
                     discomfort. But there was no help for it; Geoffrey could not enter a protest.
                     Indeed he was so accustomed to his father's manner that he never expected
                     anything different.</p>
                  <p>To add to his confusion, a few moments after, his cousin Ralph, his associate
                     in the office, inquired for the morning letters—but he had them not. At this
                     the young man was extremely mortified; it was his habit to call for them when
                     coming down in the morning, but to-day absorbed in the unusual circumstances
                     which had taken place, he had utterly forgotten them.</p>
                  <p>His father frowned still more severely; Geoffrey knew, as well as if he had
                     spoken them, what his thoughts were. And that supercilious Ralph, who never
                     made mistakes—who was like a well oiled piece of machinery, always working
                     right—he knew what <emph>his</emph> thoughts were, too!</p>
                  <p>His blood kept rising with unwonted indignation. He didn't want Ralph's pity—he
                     would'nt endure these mental reservations that spoke in his cousin's eyes, all
                     the more irritatingly because he said nothing, seeming to whisper with mocking
                     kindness, "Ah, he's a well-meaning fellow enough, but weak! He'll never be good
                     for much!"</p>
                  <p>Yes—he would let Ralph know what he could be!</p>
                  <p>Thus he fretted and fumed, angry with himself, angry with everything and with
                     everybody, till the frenzy exhausted itself. Then he rose from his desk, took
                     his hat, and with head less erect than when he entered, moodily went on his way
                     after the letters.</p>
                  <p>It must not be understood that there was any standing enmity between these two
                     young men. In reality they were much attached. They had been brought up as
                     brothers together, and had got along about as well as brothers usually do.
                     Geoffrey knew that these rather depreciating opinions concerning himself were
                     his cousin Ralph's honest convictions. But could he ever outlive them! Ah,
                     there was the rub.</p>
                  <p>Ralph was the elder by two years, and being possessed of fine capacities, and
                     blest with full confidence in them, it may be supposed they appeared for all
                     they were worth. He had been one of those lads who during their school career
                     receive high honors, delighting parents and partial friends with the triumphs
                     they achieve. His uncle had often been proud to own him as of<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000008"/> his lineage and name. With an unusual memory and
                     a clear intellect the youth was enabled to store away a vast amount of
                     learning, which he could reproduce at any time with clearness and precision.
                     This gave him a prominence which threw poor Geoffrey entirely in the shade.
                     Ralph, too, was naturally disposed to dominance, and under the circumstances,
                     having the abilities that made him so prominent before all, he soon acquired
                     vast ideas of his own superiority, and that it was only his right, a tribute
                     due to a master mind, to exact submission; and so he had ruled his young
                     cousin, who must as a matter of course be considered his inferior, with a
                     determined hand. He loved Geoffrey, though, that is with such a love as his
                     self-concentrated nature could afford.</p>
                  <p>But those who knew Geoffrey well, knew that in measure of capacity he was in no
                     way interior to Ralph. His abilities were more diversified—his susceptibilities
                     more acute. With an intuitive perception, a large, generous nature, he could
                     understand, where others had to be instructed in the knowledge; but he was
                     dreamy, confused, and highly sensitive, while only to those who appreciated him
                     could he appear all that he was.</p>
                  <p>In boyhood Ralph had been his lofty ideal. To gain his approbation, to have his
                     good opinion, embraced the great ambition of his life. As he grew older, and
                     came to know himself and things more thoroughly it served to modify his
                     hero-worship mightily. Had Ralph been less exacting, less severe in his actions
                     and judgment, and a little more cautious in his expressions of contempt,
                     Geoffrey would probably have much longer remained his willing slave. But now he
                     was sometimes indignant,—then defiant,—and at length began to really question
                     whether he was indeed the weak and insignificant lad that he had been half
                     inclined in deference to Ralph's decision, to consider himself.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, after all, this was good drilling for the youth. Over indulgence might
                     have made him inert—too happy to seek anything else; but now he was roused to
                     effort, he would let them all see what he was. Still there was no outbreak of
                     angry feelings; but this tumult of thought, these smartings and vexations, led
                     him to be more self-reliant; to think more of himself; to feel his own
                     strength, and to have more of a desire to act independently. He was in this
                     uneasy transition state at the opening of our story. Desiring to be free, and
                     in a measure so, yet not altogether absolved from the bondage that still held
                     him to the necessity for Ralph's approval and good opinion. He had been
                     struggling hard to become indifferent to it. Yet he had not so far succeeded
                     that he did not feel sorely uncomfortable, as on this morning, under the
                     suspicion that Ralph was indulging, not without apparent good reason, in
                     contemptuous thoughts about him.</p>
                  <p>Still, on the whole, they got along quite amicably. It followed, as a matter of
                     course, as they grew older, that their pursuits and enjoyments were chosen
                     apart. To Mr. Luperthorp this was a source of secret disquiet: Ralph was to
                     him, in character and habits, the embodiment of all excellence, and he had
                     hoped, till lately, that his son's more pliant nature might be moulded by the
                     influence of this cousin. But he had gradually abandoned all such expectations.
                     Geoffrey continued the same impulsive imaginative youth, whom he could not
                     understand—while Ralph followed the same impassive, systematic course, whose
                     undeviating regularity he could not too much commend.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LUPERTHORP FAMILY.—TRADITIONS.</head>
                  <p>THE short December day was near its close. The office clock had just sounded
                     the hour of five in Mr. Luperthorp's counting room. The setting sun, that
                     seldom vouchsafed its splendors in that deep buried place, cast a slender ray,
                     its last, like a golden thread across that little figure of time standing erect
                     on the desk.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey and Ralph closed with alacrity their portly ledgers, and made
                     preparation for departure. Mr. Luperthorp had left some hours before. He was
                     rather advanced in life, and being somewhat of an invalid came to the office
                     rarely, seldom remaining more than a few hours at a time. Indeed his business
                     was mostly taking care of his vast property, and he kept it in this form,
                     having a regular office, and exact office hours, more as an employment and
                     education for the young men than from any necessity. The management of matters
                     he left entirely to them, or perhaps it would be more correct to say, to his
                     nephew, Ralph, as he was in fact the constituted head, Geoffrey's part in the
                     business being only nominal.</p>
                  <p>As before intimated, Mr. Luperthorp had but a slender opinion of his son's
                     capacity, and he acted on that opinion without much reference to the young
                     man's feelings. But in fact he did not understand his son; he knew Ralph
                     better. Indeed there was an excellent understanding between the uncle and
                     nephew. Unlike Geoffrey, Ralph was always self-possessed, in fact he cared
                     little whether he pleased or displeased those with whom he had to do, and this
                     indifference gave him the advantage of always having his faculties
                     unembarrassed. He intended to do right, and he generally felt he was right, and
                     if people did'nt like it that was their business, not his.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a most desirable gift to possess a right appreciation of
                     ourselves. A foolish confidence is deplorable, but a proper assurance of all we
                     are worth, gives tone and vigor to what we undertake, imparting even to manners
                     and bearing that semblance of strength, which unconsciously inspires in others
                     a like confidence. On the other hand, the sensitive and timid, haunted by their
                     own fears, full of their own shames and mortifications, create distress, and
                     invite defeat.</p>
                  <p>Ralph, although fearless in his independence, always treated his uncle's
                     opinions with marked deference, and his uncle felt a corresponding reliance on
                     his abilities, while poor Geoffrey, fearing that he did not know much, always
                     managed to keep his father of the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>But our friends are anxious to be off. A fine afternoon, sharp and cold, had
                     succeeded the raw and clouded atmosphere of the morning. The keen nor'wester,
                     sweeping through the streets, made the blood tingle, and ruddy-faced people
                     blowing their fingers and slapping their hands passed to and from in hasty
                     succession, as the two stepped briskly onward.</p>
                  <p>Meeting a friend, and entering into a few minutes' conversation, detained them
                     on the way, so that before they reached Broadway, and passed the stately
                     Trinity, the short winter twilight had deepened into dusk. But innumerable
                     lights springing into brilliancy from every quarter, with the crowd and rush of
                     the cheerful multitude, made it bright and attractive as any gala day.</p>
                  <p>Broadway! How much there is in that name to those who have known thee in thy
                     pleasant youth, and still know thee in they not less pleasant maturity! Thou
                     art, and ever hast been the living artery, the very bone and sinew of this
                     great emporium of life. Thy present is eloquent of growing enterprise—of the
                     cheerful promise of a young, strong, energetic people. Thy past, full of
                     historic and cherished remembrances—of simple elegance and home-like comfort.
                     Thy future—keeping pace with the growth and splendor of the metropolis—may
                     exhibit to other generations yet unrevealed sources of beauty, and undreamed
                     glories of architecture.</p>
                  <p>They tell us that our New York, as compared with the cities of the old European
                     world, in excellence of management, size, and magnificence of surroundings is a
                     mere cipher—an utter insignificance. But we do not care to compare—we have our
                     own standard of excellence! And, beside, we love the noble city, which, like
                     the nation that gave it birth, is ever struggling on, restless, active, full of
                     vitality, seeking to attain a prouder eminence—we love it—and that is
                     enough.</p>
                  <p>Who that has seen, can ever forget the quiet and beauty of the former
                     Broadway?</p>
                  <p>Below the wall of Trinity, which our young friends are rapidly passing, no
                     rambling omnibus, or brisk, business-tread profaned<pb n="16-17"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000009"/> faned its dignified repose. A broad, clear,
                     beautiful avenue, sheltered by its fine old trees, it lay in all the calm of a
                     well-kept promenade; dreamily listening, rather than actually partaking the
                     noise and excitement of the city.</p>
                  <p>The eye runs through the long vista that memory recalls, and beholds on either
                     side lines of handsome dwellings, with their gay groups, bevies of beauties,
                     and richly clad women seated at their shaded windows of a warm afternoon. The
                     tide of life flows by, a joyful, eager, busy throng, wending its way to that
                     most charming and breezy retreat, the "Battery," as it then was. Child and
                     nurse, gaily attired maidens, beaux and belles, fashion and beauty, youth and
                     age, hastening down to the ocean; to meet friends, to see the world, to gaze on
                     those bright waters dotted with pleasant islands, to stroll in the broad
                     gravelled paths where luxuriant trees joined their branches in friendly
                     salutation overhead. All this, and much more,—each heart filled by its own
                     motive,—urged the throng onward to that beautiful resort.</p>
                  <p>But this time was long gone by. Geoffrey and his companion were traversing the
                     Broadway of the present. They were bound for what was then called one of the
                     uptown streets—now more in the center of the city. Their walk led them to a
                     distance of over two miles from their place of business, when they turned into
                     a spacious street built closely with elegant family residences. With
                     accelerated pace they faced the northwest breeze, now blowing strong from the
                     river; and requiring a stout resolution to brave its biting force. A few
                     minutes brought them in front of the house,—the old family homestead, it might
                     be called. It was one of the very few, even then, left to knit the past to the
                     present.</p>
                  <p>Standing as it did among the high walls and showy magnificence of modern
                     structures, it seemed perhaps rather insignificant compared with its prominence
                     of former times; yet there was an air of antique elegance about it that still
                     commanded respect. Although the building was low, it occupied much ground,
                     though curtailed in dimensions from its former size; a principal wing,
                     destroyed by fire in the latter part of the last century, never having been
                     rebuilt.</p>
                  <p>In its prime it was considered one of the finest out-of-town residences in the
                     neighborhood of the city. Its spacious grounds—now forming streets and
                     avenues—extended with park, orchard and garden, to the water's edge.</p>
                  <p>These lands with all their privileges were a crown grant to one Geoffrey
                     Luperthorp, ancestor to the present occupant.</p>
                  <p>This Geoffrey's father, a stout Fleming, had fled to England during the
                     religious persecutions then so fearfully raging in his own country. He was a
                     warrior by profession, and fortunately for himself, having reached his adopted
                     land at a time when men of skill were much needed to help the struggling
                     royalty to power, he was soon raised to eminence by the services which he
                     rendered.</p>
                  <p>The son, however, did not inherit the father's warlike propensities; but the
                     high position of his father placed him where in after years his shrewd
                     foresight was equally beneficial in more pacific times. The elder Geoffrey, at
                     quite an advanced age, was killed when successfully resisting one of those
                     border outbreaks with which the king's belligerent subjects were wont to stir
                     up his majesty. The son Geoffrey was afterwards, in consideration of his
                     father's services and his own worth knighted by that merry monarch, who, it was
                     said, never rewarded those who suffered for him, and presented with this wild
                     tract of land in the then New World.</p>
                  <p>Sir Geoffrey when quite matured in years, resolved to visit this possession,
                     which he was informed had become of considerable importance. An account of this
                     visit is still preserved with care in the family archives.</p>
                  <p>It relates, that after a tedious voyage of many weeks, ocean-tossed and weary,
                     his eyes were blessed with a sight of the promised land,—and fair he pronounced
                     it to be.</p>
                  <p>The vessel cast anchor in the beautiful bay on whose borders, till lately, had
                     flourished the thriving city of New Amsterdam—afterwards New York; having
                     received a new baptism with its complete submission to British authority.</p>
                  <p>The account speaks in glowing terms of the appearance and prosperity of the
                     little city, and of the knight's impatience to visit his lands, which were
                     within so short a distance, only a few miles, of such a growing place. But he
                     had to first submit to being feted and lionized. The city burghers, the
                     magistrates and high dignitaries of the place must show him all attention. They
                     were anxious to propitiate their new ruler in the far-off old world; and the
                     arrival of so distinguished a guest, and one who stood so high, as they were
                     told, in their royal master's favor, was an opportunity not to be lost.</p>
                  <p>So Sir Geoffrey went the rounds of the various hospitalities, and was much
                     delighted. He takes occasion in his narrative to mention the great thrift of
                     its population, and still more particularly to dwell on the remarkable neatness
                     and industry of the fairer portion of its inhabitants. He was charmed and
                     dazzled with the brightness of the brass on their doors, and the knobs on the
                     railings of their <emph>stoops;</emph> with their snow-white doorsteps, and
                     their well scoured and sanded floors, all in quaint contrast to the rather
                     barbarous grandeur of his own country—to the not over nice sense of cleanliness
                     exhibited by his countrymen and women, with their floors covered with straw and
                     rushes, the receptacles of filth and the manufactories of dust and
                     impurity.</p>
                  <p>He was also taken to view the defences erected in and around the city, to
                     protect them from the sudden attacks of the hostile tribes of Indians infesting
                     the country. Among these defences he particularly mentions a fine palisade
                     within a stone wall built across its outskirts, that had been found an
                     effectual barrier against this most formidable enemy.</p>
                  <p>After all this sight-seeing and consequent elation, he resolved, after a few
                     days of rest, to attend to the business that brought him there, and visit his
                     rich possessions. A horse, or vehicle was out of the question, both because
                     there were no roads, and on account of the rough, uneven nature of the trails
                     or paths forming the only means of transit thither. He heard many stories about
                     the bloody Indians, and was advised to take a formidable number of men with him
                     for protection. But what did the valiant Sir Geoffrey care? The face of man had
                     never yet made him quail, and a poor, paltry Indian—yes, or a score of
                     them—poh! all he wanted was a good, stout guide!</p>
                  <p>And so, early one fine October morning, they started on their expedition.</p>
                  <p>There had been heavy rains for a week before this glorious clear-off, and the
                     small streams and innumerable rivulets were swollen to a considerable degree.
                     The travelers experienced considerable difficulty in fording some, and jumping
                     others, but they pushed on with wonderful energy until the hot mid-day sun
                     began to pour its direct rays down upon them. Then it was hard work to beat
                     through the underbrush, wade through the swamps, and avoid the quicksands, all
                     the while in peril of deadly snakes and venomous reptiles!</p>
                  <p>Our poor Sir Geoffrey, stout and bulky, never much disposed to activity, found
                     his ardor beginning to abate. He almost wished he had never set foot in such
                     unholy place, and felt a secret misgiving that his most sacred Majesty had been
                     fooling him. He declared, with an oath, that he would not give a snap of his
                     lordly finger for the whole territory.</p>
                  <p>But an hour's rest in a shady wood, and a cup of water from a beautiful spring
                     trickling down the ravine near which he lay, quite restored his courage.</p>
                  <p>So, rousing himself, when the hot sun waned a little, and the afternoon breeze
                     began to be felt, the knight arose and again hopefully pursued his journey. The
                     guide now assured him they were fast nearing its end, but desiring
                     conscientiously to give the full measure of his contract, conducted the
                     traveler to its close by such devious ways that it was nearly dusk when
                        their<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5590-00000010"/> charts indicated their
                     arrival; not at the wished for spot, but a few miles beyond it.</p>
                  <p>Being tired and hungry and wet, the next thing to be done was to light a fire
                     and rest. The guide, accustomed to these things, soon gathered brush and made a
                     fire on a rising piece of ground. They then produced the contents of their
                     capacious pockets, cold meat and fine bread, all of which were made still more
                     palatable by copious draughts of good cognac. Sir Geoffrey, as he lay there,
                     happy and alone, with face upturned to the clear night-sky, glittering with its
                     thickly-bedded brilliants, and feeling the soft air like a gentle nurse fanning
                     him to sleep, almost repented him of the bitterness that had so lately filled
                     his kindly heart.</p>
                  <p>He and his guide had made arrangement to sit up alternate hours through the
                     night, to feed the watchfire, and give notice in case of danger, but as the
                     night advanced they forgot all caution, and both fell fast asleep,—sleeping
                     soundly until the clear morning light rested on their drowsy eyelids. Good Sir
                     Geoffrey, now thoroughly rested and invigorated, was enchanted on opening his
                     eyes to the glorious rising of the day.</p>
                  <p>"Talk of your English skies!" he exclaims in his enthusiastic narrative, "Why,
                     their brightest sunshine is but torchlight compared with this! Yes; and this
                     air—it is worth the journey here to breathe it! So clear, elastic and
                     transparent, that the landscape beyond, with its valleys and mountains, its
                     seas and rivers, is as plain to my vision as though within a hundred yards of
                     my eyes!"</p>
                  <p>We will not undertake to say at this distant day, how much a good supper, the
                     early going to rest, and hard exercise of the previous day had to do with this
                     brightness and clearness of his faculties; but indeed the exquisite beauty and
                     repose of all nature in this early dawn might have roused the most obtuse
                     imagination to a sense of its loveliness.</p>
                  <p>Under the vast columns of these mighty tree trunks, surmounted by the heavy
                     foliage now glowing in the resplendent colors of a changing season, he wandered
                     to the river's edge, and looked down its steep banks covered with verdure—out
                     to the jutting promontories and wooded hills of its opposite shores—and
                     listened to the low murmuring of its deep current, as it moved on in this
                     solitude, and had for ages, in the constancy of its own immutable laws. He was
                     almost overwhelmed with this new sense of the grandeur and sublimity of
                     life.</p>
                  <p>The birds now stirred to busy remembrance of their own importance, sang a
                     welcoming chorus to the coming sun, or sounded the note of departure for a more
                     southern clime, while the crisp leaves of the tall trees, swaying in the
                     freshening wind fell on the ear like the roll of a distant waterfall.</p>
                  <p>But hark! above all this, stealing. with sinister sound above the song of birds
                     and the anthem of the woods—what is this?</p>
                  <p>"Thunder and death, <emph>what</emph> is this?"</p>
                  <p>"The Indians! the Indians!" cried the guide, now pale with horror.</p>
                  <p>"Holy fathers!" exclaims our stout Sir Geoffrey, "This beats anything I ever
                     heard! All the imps of hell must be let loose!"</p>
                  <p>Down they came! screaming, yelling, whooping among the hills—down through the
                     forest, carrying their birchen canoes, and launching them with terrific shouts
                     into the still waters.</p>
                  <p>"Be still—immovable—for God's sake!" whispers the trembling guide, "It is our
                     only hope—they may not have noticed us."</p>
                  <p>It was a moment of most awful suspense. Their hearts, indeed, might literally
                     have been said to stand still. There they stood transfixed as pillars of stone,
                     looking down from the rocks on those savage men below them, as, wild for
                     adventure, their canoes one after another shot out from the low promontory into
                     the middle of the river, while the shores echoed to their guttural tones, as
                     they chaunted in regular cadence to the flash of their paddles in the morning
                     light, passing swiftly onward down the stream.</p>
                  <p>But, blessed relief, they were gone; the horrible sound of their voices was
                     dying on the air.</p>
                  <p>"Let us be off!" said Sir Geoffrey.</p>
                  <p>"But our breakfast;" humbly suggested the guide.</p>
                  <p>"Thunder and death!" cried the infuriated master, "Would you have me stay here
                     to be made mince meat of by those painted devils? A Christian foe I might
                     meet—but these fiends of darkness—God preserve us!" and with hasty strides the
                     devout knight turned about, and never came to a halt until once more within the
                     gates of the well-fortified city.</p>
                  <p>Entering the city, they found it in great commotion. The women and children
                     were gathering into the block houses, and men were running shoreward with
                     spy-glasses in their hands, while the alarm-bells rang to call all outsiders to
                     arms.</p>
                  <p>The Indians were upon them! This convoy of whose starting our friends had been
                     unexpected witnesses, was reported as reconnoitring one of the weak points of
                     their shore defences, and a night attack was expected.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this excitement, our knight ascertained that there was a vessel
                     in the offing ready to sail for the old world, and that a heavy boat now at the
                     dock, was just about starting to reach her. So, supposing perhaps, that
                     discretion was the better part of valor, he put himself and effects on board in
                     spite of all remonstrance. That vessel would take him where there was peace, at
                     least from such unhallowed foes.</p>
                  <p>He never visited the country again. At his death he left these possessions to
                     his youngest son, and through this branch came the American stock.</p>
                  <p>But in these few years rapid improvement had been made, thoroughfares opened,
                     roads completed, so that when this younger scion came to America, resolved to
                     found a home here, he had but few difficulties to encounter, and was under no
                     necessity of losing his way in the search after his possessions. This large
                     property, including a tract of land some miles beyond the then city, through
                     its constantly increasing value, caused himself and his numerous descendants to
                     rank among the richest magnates of the land.</p>
                  <p>At the time of which I wrote, the family were dwindled down to a very few, and
                     its wealth was not as immense as formerly. Each generation had spent freely,
                     and added little to the store. Still enough, and even an abundance was
                     left.</p>
                  <p>The present possessor was one of refined tastes and habits; and although he had
                     travelled much in early life, and been most munificent in his expenditures
                     wherever he went, gathering and purchasing largely of all the various works of
                     skill and art, yet had managed his affairs so judiciously that his original
                     fortune had greatly increased, instead of being diminished. He married late in
                     life a woman whom he deeply loved, but his happiness was of very brief
                     duration, his young wife dying within the year, and leaving Geoffrey, then an
                     infant of but a few days old.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Luperthorp did not marry again. After the death of his wife the reserved
                     and somewhat exclusive habits natural to him rather increased. He seldom left
                     his house, and never visited. A passing bow was all that he gave to even the
                     nearest friends. His family, who were ruled in everything by his wishes,
                     knowing his objection to all disturbance, gradually withdrew from society,
                     leading a most secluded life in the midst of the gay fashionables of the
                     city.</p>
                  <p>The house which our young friends were now entering was built by the son of Sir
                     Geoffrey, the founder of the family. The thick carved work of the vestibule was
                     so ar modernised, however, as to admit them with a latch-key. As they opened
                     the door a hall, low but spacious was revealed, the walls of which were covered
                     from floor to ceiling, and even up the sides of the broad stairway with rich
                     paintings, many of them rare works of ancient masters, and of great value.</p>
                  <p>The love of the beautiful was an absorbing passion with the master of the
                     house, as was also a reverence for all that had surrounded him in the years of
                     the past. His<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5590-00000011"/> mansion, his furniture,
                     the arrangements of the family, were in exact accordance with former usage. No
                     change whatever was allowed.</p>
                  <p>When our friends, relieved of their outer garments, opened the wide,
                     old-fashioned parlor door, there was the usual blazing fire of hickory logs,
                     crackling and sparkling on the polished brass andirons in that huge "franklin"
                     which nearly covered the lower side of the long, narrow room. There was no
                     formal announcement of supper in some far-off unsocial apartment, but the
                     cheerful tea-table was set in the center, brightening their eyes as they
                     entered with its array of silver and china. Mr. Luperthorp had so far succumbed
                     to modern innovation as to allow the introduction of a gas-light overhead. Its
                     jets of flame, mingling with the glow of the firelight, threw out in warmer
                     tints the rich coloring of the damask curtains falling in ample folds over the
                     minute panes of the great windows, and gave an added lustre to the carved
                     sideboard in the opposite arch. Everything within this family room, from the
                     heavy carpet on the floor to the mirrors on the wall, was antique, but in the
                     highest state of preservation; polished, glittering and dignified, worthily
                     reflecting into the present age the comfortable solidity of the past.</p>
                  <p>The master of the house, himself, partook of the style of all about him,
                     adding, so to speak, a certain grace and fitness to the whole.</p>
                  <p>His white hair flowing from beneath its black velvet cap, and his stately
                     person wrapped in the embroidered folds of a dark dressing-gown, rendered
                     almost artistic the effect of the high-backed, elaborately carved easy chair
                     which he usually occupied beside the glowing fire of an evening. He had grown
                     pale and much altered in the last few months, but was still a fine-looking,
                     venerable man.</p>
                  <p>After a few words of greeting all gathered around the table, now supplied with
                     inviting delicacies.</p>
                  <p>The first flush of appetite satisfied, a pleasant murmur of conversation filled
                     the apartment, as they leisurely sat sipping their fragrant tea, and enjoying
                     their iced cake.</p>
                  <p>While they are thus pleasantly engaged, let us make a little sketch of the
                     group, as we see them in the bright surroundings of this genial old
                     apartment.</p>
                  <p>In his easy chair in front of the table, polished, and erect, sits Mr.
                     Luperthorp. Aunt Edith, the sister of his deceased wife, presides at its head.
                     Mrs. Dupont, the lady at the right, is the only sister of the master of the
                     house. During her husband's life he was reputed wealthy, but on his death this
                     was discovered to be, like many other reputations, without foundation. He had
                     not only dissipated his own ample fortune, but irretrievably involved that of
                     his wife. The widow and her son were thus left penniless. With prompt
                     generosity her brother stepped forward and brought her to his own home, and
                     becoming in time very much attached to the little Ralph, had adopted him as his
                     son.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine, the bright girl whose pleasant voice and winning ways enliven with a
                     touch of girlish freedom and carelessness the somewhat formal stateliness of
                     the group, is the orphan daughter of a distant relative of the Luperthorp
                     family, a young girl, who by an early, and most imprudent marriage incurred the
                     displeasure of her wealthy connexions. The offence she had expiated by poverty,
                     sickness and death: friendless, and deserted by all, she had solemnly upon her
                     dying-bed bequeathed to the care of Mrs. Dupont her infant daughter. This
                     child, coming into the family under such circumstances, and at so early an age,
                     soon gained the affections of all. Mr. Luperthorp had educated her as though
                     she were a daughter of the house, although it was generally conceded that she
                     belonged more particularly to Mrs. Dupont, indeed she was usually called the
                     daughter of that lady, by those not familiar with her history.</p>
                  <p>The young men were very fond of Madeleine and guarded her with the greatest
                     tenderness. Her influence had happily tempered the somber aspect of that
                     strictly regulated household, and had been particularly beneficial to the
                     growing lads, who, save for that redeeming streak of radiance, might have been
                     tempted to fly from its gloomy exactions.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith, the lady with the sweet, sad countenance,—the countenance that
                     rarely smiles, yet never frowns, is, as has been said, an elder sister of the
                     late Mrs. Luperthorp, on whose decease she had been invited to take charge of
                     the household, and to be especially responsible for the bringing-up of his
                     child. This task she had willingly undertaken, and well had fulfilled its
                     duties. How well, was attested by the order and completeness of all the family
                     arrangements, by the cheerful happiness of its members, and by the filial love
                     of the one whom she had so devotedly cherished from infancy to youth, from
                     youth to almost manhood. She is a woman of much refinement and dignity of
                     manner, and well becomes her place as mistress of the board.</p>
                  <p>A little episode in the early days of her young charge gives a peculiar
                     significance to her position at table, and renders its unimportant honors
                     almost sacred in her eyes.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was a sensitive, and perhaps more than usually observant child. These
                     peculiarities may have been increased by the influence of Aunt Edith's
                     thoughtful temperament, and the deep melancholy pervading her countenance and
                     actions, even amid the cheer and harmony which her presence inspired. An
                     unchildlike and watchful anxiety was thus excited, leading his mind into
                     channels too mature for his tender age. Comprehending intuitively the nature of
                     one who was as a mother to him, he watched with eager earnestness every change
                     in that beloved face; and his own little heart would sigh, and its griefs
                     deepen with every varying expression of those mournful eyes.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith saw all this, and she tried to cover up the secret sorrow of her
                     soul, for the child's sake. What that sorrow was none knew. She never spoke of
                     it. Once when the child in his loving tenderness questioned her, she had turned
                     aside in passionate tears, and the boy only knew that there was a wound there,
                     sensitive, unhealed, not to be touched by any hand, however gentle and
                     commiserating. From his earliest recollection his aunt had always appeared in
                     widow's weeds, but how long she had been married, or when her husband died no
                     one seemed to know. And Mr. Luperthorp if he did know never spoke on the
                     subject.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey never liked his aunt Dupont; she never liked him. In fact she
                     positively disliked him. Dislike, perhaps is scarcely the word for so unequal a
                     feeling as must exist between one so mature and one so young. I had better say
                     she despised him. He was beneath her notice. When she first beheld him, a
                     feeble, puny child, this sentiment had manifested itself, and it had not
                     diminished in strength by any means as years passed away. "He is so different,"
                     she said then, and always continued to say, with a pertinacity which rendered
                     the proposition difficult of controversion, "so different from my son Ralph!
                     poor weakly child! If he had half Ralph's strength and intellect! Well, all I
                     can say is, I pity my brother and his only child."</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Geoffrey felt her unsympathetic pity, and the unexpressed comparison of
                     the two boys which was always going on in the mind of his aunt Dupont; it may
                     have been this which made him shrink from her. She was little aware of his keen
                     and almost instinctive insight into character, and had no suspicion that he
                     noted and understood clearly the motives of many things which escaped the
                     observation of others.</p>
                  <p>One point, perhaps, which rendered him still more distasteful to Mrs. Dupont,
                     was his extreme tenacity and sensitiveness in regard to the rights of aunt
                     Edith.</p>
                  <p>When he was young—so young that sitting at table with the family was yet a
                     privilege rather than a right, he was often indulged, when there were no
                     visiters, in taking the last meal of the day beside aunt Edith, sitting in
                     state at her right hand before his dismissal for the evening. It<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000012"/> may be that in this he was a little spoiled; but
                     he had been so long the only child of that lonely house, and took so little
                     advantage of his indulgences, being in truth so gentle, and good, and loveable,
                     that aunt Edith might well be excused in letting the reins of government
                     sometimes hang loosely in her hands.</p>
                  <p>One evening he drew his chair to the usual place and sat down, but hesitated,
                     looked around, and glanced from one to another with uneasy, inquiring glances,
                     as he found that it was not aunt Edith who sat beside him at the head of the
                     table, but aunt Dupont.</p>
                  <p>"Why don't you sit here, aunt Edith?" said the little fellow, as she quietly
                     took a seat on the other side.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont's clear, precise voice answered promptly, "My dear, I will relieve
                     aunt Edith of this trouble, and she can attend more to you."</p>
                  <p>"But aunt Edith does not think it any trouble, and I do not want any more
                     attention—so, aunt Edith—come and sit <emph>this</emph> side."</p>
                  <p>"Silence!" said Mr. Luperthorp, now roused to attention, "silence, sir! I
                     cannot have this disturbance."</p>
                  <p>For a moment there was silence, but the child burst out again, and this time it
                     was evidently a real cry of distress which he was unable to suppress.</p>
                  <p>"Upon my word this is too much," said his father, rising, and approaching the
                     child, as if to enforce explanation.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, father!" said the boy, sobbing and terrified, "I <emph>cannot</emph> help
                     it!"</p>
                  <p>"What is it you want?" said his father, imperiously.</p>
                  <p>"I want—I want aunt Edith to—to sit there!"</p>
                  <p>"Ridiculous! this is really too much of a farce," said Mrs. Dupont, rousing at
                     last from the silent astonishment into which this exhibition of what she
                     religiously regarded as "natural depravity," had thrown her, "Why, brother, do
                     you not send him from the table? It is injudicious, I may say unpardonable,
                     that he is here at all—I do not ask it for my boy. Geoffrey is
                     ruined—spoiled—he will very soon govern the house. You had better see to
                     it."</p>
                  <p>But Mr. Luperthorp did not then seem disposed to send his son away. He felt
                     that it could not be altogether a whim; there was too intense an earnestness
                     about the child's manner for this; it impressed him as out of the ordinary
                     range of childish freaks of temper.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, however, Geoffrey, if you wish so much that aunt Edith should take
                     the place of aunt Dupont, you can give us a reason for this."</p>
                  <p>Reason! poor child, that little head was throbbing with the wild riot of
                     reasons swelling and surging in his brain; but he had no words to put his
                     thoughts in shape. Our emotions and sympathies are born with us, but not the
                     power to give them utterance, and all the boy could do was to sob, and repeat
                     the piteous wail,</p>
                  <p>"Oh, father! do, please do, have aunt Edith sit here!"</p>
                  <p>"Amelia, it is but a trifling matter," said Mr. Luperthorp to his sister, "let
                     us indulge him this time." But half ashamed of this unaccustomed yielding, he
                     added sternly, turning to his son, "Now, mark me, Geoffrey, this is the last
                     time I will listen to any of your nonsense. If you ever attempt to repeat this
                     scene, you shall leave the table, and shall never come to it again."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont arose in silence, and left the room. Some days elapsed before she
                     made her appearance again; but this passed unnoticed, and aunt Edith was never
                     afterward disturbed in her position.</p>
                  <p>But that time was long gone by. If Geoffrey still regarded with little
                     affection his aunt Dupont, and still felt the real nature of this plausible
                     woman under the zealous interest which she always manifested in his welfare, he
                     had at least learned to be more judicious in the expression of his perceptions.
                     Between them there was always a formal and deferential intercourse, but nothing
                     more.</p>
                  <p>On this December evening of which I am writing, there was a sense of complete
                     enjoyment all around that table. The cold outside, and the cheerful warmth
                     within, gave such a realization of the comfort in their immediate possession,
                     that they could not but experience from the sharp contrast, an added zest of
                     contentment. Ralph and his uncle were as usual in close conversation, enlivened
                     now and then by a remark from Mrs. Dupont, while Geoffrey and the rest of the
                     party chatted briskly and busily on subjects equally interesting to
                     themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thus they lingered for an hour, and were about to rise from the table when a
                     servant brought in a note and handed it to his master. It was a trivial matter,
                     but one exceedingly irritating to a person of Mr. Luperthorp's habits of
                     punctuality; a carpenter's bill for some trifling repairs about the house had
                     been overlooked, and he now sent a request for immediate payment.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Luperthorp took out his pocket-book to hand the amount, but he found there
                     was very little in it. "Geoffrey,' said he to his son, "let me have till
                     tomorrow those few gold pieces I gave you last night." The young man was
                     completely taken by surprise;</p>
                  <p>"Is it me, sir, you are speaking to?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," repeated his father, with decided emphasis, "yes! Have your senses about
                     you! Be quick—I want those pieces."</p>
                  <p>"But I have not got them."</p>
                  <p>"Have not got them? You could not have spent them already. If you have not all,
                     give me what you have—perhaps that may be enough."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was now completely covered with confusion. He colored and hesitated as
                     he answered,</p>
                  <p>"I declare, sir, that I have not one of them."</p>
                  <p>"Have not one of them? Nonsense! Where are they—what have you done with them?"
                     asked his father, hastily.</p>
                  <p>"I gave them away," said the young man, much abashed.</p>
                  <p>His father's eye was on him, with a fixed, suspicious, penetrating gaze. He
                     thought of the lateness of the hour on which his son had come to business that
                     morning; of his flushed manner, and his forgetfulness; a dark misgiving came
                     into his mind, which was plainly marked in his countenance. Geoffrey had not
                     the stamina or indifference to bear such look unconcerned. Ralph could have
                     done so, and thought his uncle a fool for being so mistaken. But many feelings
                     mingled to make this slight encounter bitterly painful to Geoffrey;
                     mortification to be exposed in such a position; vexation that he could be the
                     subject of suspicion; self-contempt that he was unable to brace his nerves and
                     show what was in his heart—an utter contempt for all dissimulation. No—there he
                     must stand—trembling like some guilty craven, when every energy and sense of
                     self-respect called him to assert his manhood. This anger, and almost despair
                     of himself helped him to raise his eyes more coldly to his father's as he
                     repeated,</p>
                  <p>"Yes sir: I gave them away."</p>
                  <p>"There is no occasion to repeat this assertion," said his father. "If truth be
                     in the mere repetition, it is enough. But it is not truth," he added with cold
                     and bitter emphasis, "you know it is not truth—you dare not say it is truth.
                     There is some devilish plotting going on. Tell me what you have done with that
                     money, I say, sir,—on your peril tell me what you have done with it!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Luperthorp was a man of powerful passions, although they were kept under
                     strong control. Seldom manifested, when they did break loose he was blind to
                     all consequences. In this instance he forgot all present—the waiting
                     servant—the agitated group—so that when Geoffrey, pale with excitement repeated
                     almost mechanically, "I did give that money away—I do dare to say so, and I
                     cannot say anything else," his father answered with a voice loud and
                     determined, yet cold and deep,</p>
                  <p>"You shall suffer for this to the latest hour of your life. I will make you
                     feel it. Yes, by the great Eternal I swear it—you shall!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, brother, brother!" exclaimed aunt Edith, "don't, speak such words! I
                        know<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5590-00000013"/> that they can only reap
                     anguish and bitterness to those who utter them. They will never bring justice
                     or retribution to any but ourselves."</p>
                  <p>There was no answer made. Mr. Luperthorp sat down exhausted in the chair from
                     which he had risen with so much energy. Indeed all were stunned, amazed,—the
                     altercation had been so sudden and violent, and there seemed so little cause
                     for such extreme anger.</p>
                  <p>It is common to express surprise at an unwonted outbreak of passion, when to
                     the cool looker-on the provocation often appears so very trifling. Men meet, at
                     times, when a simple word, even a touch, or a look, perhaps, rouses the hidden
                     fire, and angry words are followed by angry blows; the collision seems to
                     spring out of nothing. But if we could inquire into these things, we might find
                     some old sore had been rudely touched; some secret spring disturbed which
                     overflowed with an added drop of bitterness. So with Mr. Luperthorp, this
                     evening's outbreak was not the beginning of the evil. Nor, save externally, was
                     it to be the end. Had he been one to whom after the first flush of anger was
                     past, the serious talk could have come on, a misunderstanding would have been
                     of less consequence. But all then present knew that when he dismissed a subject
                     it was not to be brought up again, and allusion to it would be considered an
                     insult, and at once put down.</p>
                  <p>And so all were silent; but not the less busy were their thoughts. Geoffrey had
                     some staunch supporters. He had a way of making people love him. Mrs. Dupont
                     thought her brother was right, of course. Ralph was not so sure. Geoffrey was a
                     good sort of fellow, but then he was rather weak in the main. Thoughtless and
                     good-humored, he might have been led into some scrape. He was not altogether
                     decided. But aunt Edith and Madeleine were firm. Nothing could shake their
                     faith. They knew that even though appearances might seem against him they could
                     all be explained away.</p>
                  <p>"If I were but a man," thought Madeleine, "and uncle Luperthorp not so old, oh,
                     dear, what I would do!" And her beautiful ringlets, in favor of these mental
                     darings, might be said to be possessed with perpetual motion. Her color rose
                     and her eye brightened, while her fingers trembled so much that she was obliged
                     at last to lay the untouched needlework in her lap.</p>
                  <p>There was no music, no general conversation that long evening. Perhaps Geoffrey
                     was the most unconcerned of any in the room. He had been very angry, very
                     bitter, and very revengeful—but it had passed away. How could he brood moodily
                     over his wrong with that great human love in his heart, first stirred into
                     existence that day. It bathed his soul as with a subtle and delicious ether,
                     and spread out balmily over every person and thing about him, carrying his
                     thoughts away to that little ruined cabin on the brow of the hill, with all its
                     warm-natures and affectionate hearts.</p>
                  <p>It seemed as if he had known and felt more this day than in all the days of his
                     life before.</p>
                  <p>The sharp cold wind that came with such melancholy shrieks along the high wall
                     of the building adjoining theirs, and wailed even around their own stately
                     doorway, did not disturb him now. There was a fire and warmth, he knew, in that
                     little cabin. How sweet the widow might rest that night. He wondered how that
                     great, untidy, soiled girl would look in smart clothes. She was certainly very
                     coarse and plain, but what a pleasant smile she had—and those awkward shy
                     glances—there was intelligence in them, even if she was stupid in everything
                     else.</p>
                  <p>Gradually by association of ideas, up started the image of the beautiful girl,
                     who had dazzled his eyes in this wonderful day of adventures. How anxious he
                     was now to be alone with aunt Edith and Madeleine, and tell them all about her.
                     Would he ever see her again? <emph>Who</emph> was she? This reverie led him
                     into such a labyrinth of fancy and thought, that when the great hall clock
                     struck the hour of ten, the signal for all to retire, he was as if awaked from
                     a dream, having forgotten that any one was around him.</p>
                  <p>But it was still some hours before aunt Edith and Madeleine and Geoffrey
                     retired for the night. In aunt Edith's little dressing room the three gathered,
                     and the hours sped most swiftly in talking over the events of the day, till
                     aunt Edith declared she would not allow them to remain up one minute
                     longer.</p>
                  <p>"Didn't I whisper to you, aunt Edith," said Madeleine when Geoffrey was gone,
                     "Didn't I know it would be all right? It was too hard of uncle Luperthorp to
                     say such things to Geoffrey. I think Ralph, who isn't the least afraid, might
                     have spoken."</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith kissed her good-night. "Forget this, and go to sleep, dear," she
                     said, "my poor brother is not well."</p>

                  <p>I HOPE I may be permitted, with due apology for the interruption, to devote one
                     very short chapter to aunt Edith; to speak of her early life and of her early
                     days, and how she became a member of this quiet household, and the trusted
                     friend of its head.</p>
                  <p>I wish to dwell thus on all I know of her, because I love her; not because she
                     is perfect—for to take her own statement, there is a heavy sin lying on her
                     soul—but because she is good: good in the sense of that love which spreads out
                     in pitying, sustaining sympathy to all. The veriest sinner might pour out his
                     sorrows and temptations on her breast, and find himself by her loving heart
                     strengthened to a better life.</p>
                  <p>Some twenty years or so before the time of my story, perhaps within the first
                     twenty-five years of this century, there stood on either side of the City-hall
                     the Bridewell and the debtor's Jail. Many now living can remember these dark,
                     sombre buildings, that stood as mocking shadows to the fair hall of justice
                     rising in the center. Still in the light of the morning sun even these dark
                     buildings looked pleasant enough, with their innumerable windows, enclosed
                     plots and high steps, viewed from the green peaceful surroundings of the park.
                     Although those windows, looking out on the busy world beneath, must have given,
                     I think, a suggestive and sinister meaning to the place; and an imaginative
                     man, no matter how busy, must have found it difficult to divest himself of
                     unpleasant speculations regarding those iron gratings from whence glanced out
                     on the eager whirl of life in which they could not share, so many weary and
                     wistful eyes.</p>
                  <p>I do not know that any such consciousness of observation troubled the elderly
                     gentleman who walked the broad flagging fronting these buildings on that bright
                     morning, so many years ago. He did not appear to be troubled with any
                     day-dreams, reveries or speculations on life, although he strolled along
                     without any apparent purpose other than to loiter away the time. But he was
                     soon awakened from his apathy in a manner most unexpected to himself.</p>
                  <p>As his appearance indicated, he was a man of leisure, and he was there this
                     morning, as he had often been before, waiting the opening of the courts, to
                     spend the morning hours in listening to some favorite speaker, or watching the
                     progress of a case in which he took an interest.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of the world; had been flattered and courted by what is called its
                     best society; one of those unfortunate individuals with friends and
                     acquaintances apparently innumerable, who pass through life without one real
                     friendship. He had never formed any special attachment, and now that the fire
                     of youth was spent, began to doubt whether there were any such thing. But he
                     had yet to be made aware that there was a vulnerable point left quite
                     unguarded, through which even he, so assured and self-possessed could be taken
                     by surprise.</p>
                  <p>As he was passing the Broadway gate of the park in his leisurely stroll to and
                        fro<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5590-00000014"/> and was about to turn back
                     again, a young girl entered. Her dress was very plain, and there was nothing
                     striking in her appearance, but the remarkable grace of her bearing, at once
                     fixed his attention, and when she came near, and raised her eyes in passing,
                     they shed a strange influence over him, subtle and like a spell. Wonderful eyes
                     they seemed to him, lovely, lustrous, melting. It was only a fair, innocent
                     face, but those eyes sent a ray to his inmost soul. He thought of the many eyes
                     he had met unabashed in his social life,—splendid eyes—magnificent eyes—eyes
                     that excelled in attack, retreat, or manœuvre, completely bewildering the
                     hapless foe under their fire. But these quiet eyes, raised unconsciously to his
                     in passing—they had reached his heart.</p>
                  <p>Following her at a distance he saw the young girl ascending the steps of the
                     debtor's jail, and disappear behind its heavy grated door.</p>
                  <p>About the localities of crime—or, even about the localities charged with the
                     punishment of crime, a certain atmosphere is observable; a heaviness, as if
                     guilt even in its possible transmutation, or reformation into virtue, weighed
                     down the air with its joyless presence; as if a palpable presence of evil, like
                     the exhalations of a vault, checked the respiration, chilling and oppressing
                     the blood. Evidently the young woman felt this sensation; her quick pace
                     slackened, and she ascended those high steps slowly and wearily. Our friend
                     noticed this from his distant position.</p>
                  <p>"Surely she will come out," he muttered, "She cannot stay long in there!"</p>
                  <p>And he was right. After the lapse of an hour she reappeared; and now he saw, as
                     she again came near, that her eyes were sad, and her face worn and pale. She
                     passed out of sight, but the remembrance of those eyes lingered with him; he
                     thought of them through the day, and dreamed of them through the night.</p>
                  <p>It was, indeed, a strange pursuit for one of his age and habits—to wait in a
                     public park day after day, merely to see a young girl pass; but it was like a
                     dream, or some overmastering influence. We do not surprise ourselves. We look
                     upon, or are hurried into the midst of the most unexpected circumstances, and
                     feel no astonishment; it is only afterward we wonder that we did not wonder. It
                     seemed to this grave gentleman, in his profound entrancement, not at all
                     strange that he, usually so deliberate in all his movements, so regular in all
                     his habits, should rise early, make a hasty toilet, and rush to the appointed
                     place, for such an object; he gave himself up without question to the full
                     power of this new infatuation.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, however, it is not right to call so intense a feeling an infatuation:
                     the thing was perfectly natural—it was only his age, and general apathy to all
                     sentiment which rendered it remarkable.</p>
                  <p>He noticed that the unknown lady every morning carried a parcel, but always
                     returned without it. His silent conjectures in regard to her daily errand were
                     numerous; sometimes he almost felt tempted to speak, but delicacy held him
                     back. No: he would not wound or alarm her sensitive nature even to gratify this
                     yearning which was fast becoming unendurable. Sometimes he fancied she knew,
                     and reciprocated, may be a very little—who could tell?—just a little—this fond
                     admiration. How could she fail to know it? Why, the very winds must whisper it
                     to her!</p>
                  <p>At other times, tortured and bewildered by the novelty of his feelings, full of
                     doubt and disquietude, he sank almost to the depths of despair.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I am a fool! I forget that she is a child, and I am an old man. These
                     glimpses of what the joys of life might be, must be smothered forever. I will
                     fly from this folly! I will fly, before the whole world laughs—before I even
                     despise myself irretrievably."</p>
                  <p>And the proud man did leave.</p>
                  <p>The fashionable season was at its hight. He entered into all the festivities of
                     the gay summer resorts—went from one place of amusement to another—conversed
                     with beautiful women—walked with gay and graceful maidens—it would not do. He
                     missed at every turn that pale, expressive countenance in which he could seem
                     to discern every thought. Then came the dread that she might be gone, and he,
                     perhaps, could never find her again. Impelled by an anxious impatience, he
                     hastily returned to the city and was once more at his old haunt, pacing the
                     broad flagging, fearful, longing, waiting.</p>
                  <p>He looked at his watch; it was the usual hour for the young girl's arrival. He
                     had been there some time, and yet she did not come. Perhaps the threatening
                     morning prevented her. The clouds were gathering blackly overhead; even now a
                     few drops of rain began to fall, and the sound of distant thunder muttered in
                     the skies. He ought to have been glad she was not there.</p>
                  <p>But he could not be reasonable—it was so bitter a disappointment. Yet at length
                     she comes! his waiting has not been vain,—she appears, not from the street, as
                     he expected, but descending the steps of the jail.</p>
                  <p>It was raining fast. She had no umbrella, and as she approached where he was
                     standing, he saw that her eyes were red with weeping. Ah, poor young creature!
                     he could have sheltered her in his heart from every cruel blast—might he not
                     with all propriety just offer his umbrella? He dared not speak yet, but
                     followed her diffidently, undecided what to do. As they passed through the
                     gateway the swinging gate caught in her dress; he hastened to assist her in
                     extricating it, when she raised her eyes so gratefully to thank him that he
                     ventured to offer his umbrella at last. Could he not take her to some place of
                     shelter? The rain now dashed down, and the thunder rattled fiercely. She seemed
                     frightened,</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes," she said, "yes; I will go back to my father. He did not wish me to
                     leave."</p>
                  <p>As he offered his arm, she glanced up shyly, evidently recognising the face
                     that had become so familiar, and so often looked kindly upon her, that she had
                     missed it in its absence. It was a face that none could doubt; whose every
                     lineament was marked by the high thought and elevated principles of its
                     possessor, and she accepted his assistance in the spirit in which it was
                     offered. Walking on with hasty steps, the prison walls soon sheltered them from
                     the storm.</p>
                  <p>"Will you come with me?" she said, passing across the outer vestibule toward
                     the great inner gates. He followed silently.</p>
                  <p>She ascended the broad wooden stairway, worn with the frequent pressure of
                     heavy feet. The light-hearted step in unison with their buoyant hopes, but the
                     sad and hopeless leave the impression of their weight of sorrows on the very
                     stones they tread upon. These well-worn steps were evidently depressed in
                     sympathetic misery with the misery that had so often made its weary passage
                     over them.</p>
                  <p>Proceeding up one or two flights, they entered a narrow corridor, lighted dimly
                     from grated windows. At one of the doors opening upon this passage the young
                     girl softly tapped, gently pushing it open as she did so. A small, bare room
                     was revealed, containing a cot, a chair or two, and a table. At the table sat
                     an old man, his elbows resting upon it, and his face buried in his hands.</p>
                  <p>At the noise of their entrance he started up, and throwing his arms about the
                     girl seemed quite overcome with emotion.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my poor child," he exclaimed, "out in this storm! I thought you would be
                     lost!"</p>
                  <p>"Father, this gentleman kindly protected me with his umbrella."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you,—thank you sir," said the old man, bowing courteously to the
                     visiter.</p>
                  <p>"I beg your pardon—pray be seated sir. But I was so anxious about this child,
                     and relieved by her return, that you will excuse my oversight."</p>
                  <p>These words, spoken with affability, and even a certain dignity, conveyed the
                     instant impression to the keen perception of his listener, that whatever
                     misfortune had befallen him, the speaker was a gentleman.</p>
                  <p>They were soon all seated, the fair girl on a low bench at her father's knee,
                     the stranger on one of the two chairs which were all the apartment could
                     boast.</p>
                  <p>The storm outside continued unabated;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5590-00000015"/>
                     the wind blew furiously, and the lightning glared almost continuously. The
                     group instinctively drew closer together. The reserved and haughty stranger
                     softened to words of affectionate inquiry, till the old man's pride melted
                     before the voice of sympathy, and with his daughter's face close nestling on
                     his knee to keep out the blinding flashes of lightning, he told his story.</p>
                  <p>It was a story often told in commercial cities, of fortunes lost, of ruin,
                     sickness and debt. This old man, shut up in this desolate room, the unknown
                     inmate of a jail, had once been ranked as one of the millionaires of a
                     neighboring city; but extravagant living, and too many speculations on a rather
                     slender foundation, had, when reverses came, ensured sudden and certain
                     failure. "I was getting old," he said, "and it was hard to begin anew. I made
                     several attempts, but without avail, and my family decided to leave the place
                     where they had been so humiliated—they thought they could bear these reverses
                     better among strangers. Perhaps we had not always acted in prosperity with that
                     judgment which commands respect when adversity comes—it appeared best to go
                     away. But it was a mistake—a sad mistake. I was too old to get employment in a
                     new place, entirely unknown. Younger men than I were wanted. I tried long; the
                     little we had was going, our furniture, our clothing, everything, at length we
                     were so hardly pinched, that, I think, but for our daughters we must have
                     starved. My eldest girl, though for many years an invalid, struggled with her
                     weakness, and gave lessons in music and painting, until finally her strength
                     gave way, and she now lies a second time helpless and suffering. My wife
                     entirely broke down under these calamities. Debts accumulated which I had no
                     power to meet, and at length I was thrown into this jail.</p>
                  <p>"Being a stranger here, there was no one whom I could ask to be security for my
                     appearance, and here I have lain for months hopeless almost. This poor girl
                     brings me my food every morning, and takes care of her sick mother and sister
                     at home. This morning she came earlier than usual—to bring me the sad news that
                     my poor wife is worse—dying, sir, in all probability—dying, and I cannot be
                     with her!"</p>
                  <p>During her father's recital his daughter wept bitterly.</p>
                  <p>But help was at hand. A few hours and they were all together, and their
                     benefactor with them, around that sick bed. His happiness was scarcely less
                     than theirs as he looked on this scene of reunion. Great is the blessing of
                     riches when the heart is rich also in warm and generous emotions.</p>
                  <p>The young daughter of this unfortunate household soon learned to love one who
                     had brought such happiness to all she cherished. It was a pure and earnest
                     attachment, notwithstanding their difference in age.</p>
                  <p>In a few months they were married by the bedside of that dying mother, who only
                     lingered to bless them. Her death was soon followed by that of her husband, who
                     broken in health and spirits by his long confinement, could not seem to rally
                     from the shock.</p>
                  <p>There was now only left to the care of the young wife, the sweet and pure and
                     serious Edith. Our aunt Edith.</p>
                  <p>She was the elder sister,—the sister who struggled and labored when all other
                     means failed, to nourish and cherish those she loved, with the same unknown,
                     unspoken sorrow even then a burden on her soul.</p>
                  <p>The young wife loved, and was supremely happy. It is doubtful whether she ever
                     saw those furrows or those gray hairs which besprinkling the dark locks of her
                     husband marked the great disparity of years between them.</p>
                  <p>Such were the father and mother of Geoffrey Luperthorp.</p>
                  <p>But their happiness was of brief duration. Within a year the idolized wife was
                     taken away by death, leaving the infant Geoffrey, but a few days old.</p>
                  <p>It seems a misfortune, and we cannot but view it as such, when one just on the
                     threshold of life, looking forward with such hopeful anticipations of its
                     future, and such deep experiences of its past, as had been, crowded into her
                     short existence—experiences which render the true and good stronger, and more
                     fit to do the world's work—it is a misfortune, apparently, when they are taken
                     away. It can only be regarded as one of those painful accidents or
                     circumstances which thwart our effort and progress in life. We do not
                     understand it, we can only submit.</p>
                  <p>Her husband was almost crushed by the blow. He shut himself up in his own
                     house, and ceased altogether to mingle with the world. It might be supposed
                     that he would now center all his affections on the child she had left—but this
                     was not the case.</p>
                  <p>His heart had opened to one great love,—had that object still existed, through
                     it he would have become interested in other things; but now it was gone his
                     heart closed again around its memory, and he became once more the exclusive,
                     self-contrated man out of the reach, it appeared, of human sympathy. He was
                     anxious that the child should be well cared for, and that every attention <choice>
                        <sic>neccessary</sic>
                        <corr>necessary</corr>
                     </choice> to its well-being should be supplied, but no love was ever
                     manifested.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith, fortunately supplied all deficiencies. She was father and mother
                     and all beside. She idolized the child, and he returned her all the affection
                     and duty of a son.</p>

                  <head type="sub">DEATH OF MR. LUPERTHORP.—THE WILL.</head>
                  <p>MR. LUPERTHORP did not appear the next day or evening, after the altercation
                     with his son. Indeed he was becoming so feeble that any unusual excitement
                     completely unnerved him.</p>
                  <p>His health was evidently declining; as spring approached he less and less often
                     made his appearance at the family circle. Though not confined to his room, he
                     had become so weak as generally to prefer its retirement to the exertion of
                     conversation and social observances. The young men paid their respects to him
                     morning and evening, Ralph lingering sometimes to say a few words on business,
                     or to inquire if there were any commands. Mrs. Dupont usually spent a few hours
                     with him in the morning, and aunt Edith whiled away a portion of the evening
                     hours in reading or in conversation, but he only submitted to these attentions,
                     he always preferred to be alone.</p>
                  <p>The absence of the head of the house interfered much with the regular enjoyment
                     of the family. Few of us estimate the pleasures which center in great and
                     accustomed objects of interest. We do not know until they are gone how much a
                     part of our life had become the dear old father and mother, the invalid sister,
                     or the affectionate child, around whom all could cluster as the center of
                     attraction to their best feelings and purest affections. How we missed them
                     when they were taken! and how long it was before we could fill the vacuum.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont generally kept her own room of an evening now, and aunt Edith was
                     necessarily much away, so the young people were left to occupy the roomy old
                     parlor, that sometimes seemed gloomy enough. Ralph generally had his book, and
                     appeared wholly absorbed in its perusal; and thus Madeleine and Geoffrey were
                     thrown upon their own resources for recreations. But as young people can very
                     generally adapt themselves to circumstances, they were not long in finding some
                     expedient.</p>
                  <p>It was nearing Geoffrey's twentieth birthday, couldn't they get up some little
                     entertainment for the occasion? perhaps theatricals,—some very simple
                     thing;—aunt Edith would assist them—and they could bring in old Stephen—(who
                     was old since their first remembrance)—and his grandaunt, still an honored
                     member of the family, who had nursed Mr. Luperthorp when a baby. But all this
                     must necessarily be a secret, because it was to be a surprise. Perhaps
                     Geoffrey's father might be induced to come down that evening, and then he
                     couldn't but be pleased and astonished.</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5590-00000016"/>
                  <p>So their conversation gradually ran into a pleasant whisper—even Ralph mustn't
                     hear it—at any rate if he did he would'nt take any interest—thinks himself so
                     much above us! And by degrees, as the interest of the important subject
                     increased, the council of two edged down to the lower end of the long table,
                     that they might not disturb him, talking over all their plans in the lowest
                     voice, while Madeleine was professedly deeply engaged in her embroidery, till
                     Ralph, seeming entirely out of patience with these suppressed gigglings and
                     whisperings, would slap his book on the table and leave the room, slamming the
                     door after him as if in complete disgust with their folly.</p>
                  <p>"Dear me! isn't Ralph rude," Madeleine would say impatiently on these
                     occasions, "and getting to be so cross—he scarcely speaks to me at all!"</p>
                  <p>"Neither does he to me," Geoffrey would reply, confidentially, "I cannot
                     understand him. Even in the office through the day if I ask him a question he
                     scarcely answers me."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I wouldn't trouble myself about it," answers the young lady, with a toss
                     of her curls, "he always was a whimsical fellow—and so easily offended! Dear
                     me, I wonder if he thinks he is so much better than we are, that we must fold
                     our hands and smile when he smiles, and be silent when he is sulky? I'll let
                     him see something different from that—indeed I will!"</p>
                  <p>Between Madeleine and Geoffrey there had sprung up a closer intimacy since that
                     eventful evening of the disagreement between his father and himself. Before
                     that there had been merely the usual interest of two young people thrown much
                     together. Madeleine liked Geoffrey, because she always found him pleasant, and
                     ready for any enjoyment and sport that might be had as a sort of "aside" in the
                     midst of the quiet and solemnity of the household; and he liked her, and sought
                     her society, as he would that of any bright, congenial spirit, as a relief from
                     the formality and decorum of his surroundings.</p>
                  <p>But since that night something of party feeling had arisen—in fact went through
                     the whole house—a report of the state of affairs having been transmitted
                     immediately to the regions below, where all the old retainers felt themselves
                     called upon to pass judgment upon any family matters that came within their
                     hearing. The intelligence that Geoffrey was in disgrace—that he had been giving
                     away money which he ought not, and wouldn't tell his father anything about
                     it—gave rise to many warm discussions. Some were decidedly severe and stringent
                     in their remarks—disposed to sanction the most despotic measures, while others,
                     especially the women, and eldest of the menservants, felt disposed to think
                     that the "old master had little to do, to make such a whilabaloo about that
                     money. He had plenty, and wasn't it the young man's own? Hadn't he a right to
                     do what he chose with what had been given him? He had always been a clever
                     lad—right hearty with every thing—not like "some folks." This was spoken low,
                     with a slight elevation of the nose, and the merest toss of the head, the
                     slightest possible hint in regard to the whereabouts of the repudiated
                     individual, accompanied with an expressive "Aye, aye, we understand!" which
                     appeared to settle the matter at once in the most triumphant manner.</p>
                  <p>But our upstairs partisans, being better informed in all the circumstances, had
                     less to say, though no less positive in upholding or condemning. Madeleine's
                     tender heart would naturally incline her to the weaker side, but Geoffrey being
                     on that side, made the decision at once conclusive. Thus their intercourse
                     naturally assumed a much closer intimacy. He told her all his fears and hopes,
                     and all the difficulties he had in his daily misunderstandings with Ralph and
                     his father. How much he would like to sit down and talk to them as he did to
                     Madeleine and aunt Edith, but he could not. He did not mean to blame anybody.
                     Indeed if there were any fault it must be with himself, for he had lately
                     become aware how much temper he had, and how quickly he became angry, and
                     revengeful, "Only it would be so pleasant to sit by father ther, and talk to
                     him in the ordinary way, and tell him how much it pains me," here the young man
                     brushed away a tear, "to see him grow so pale and feeble. Oh, if I only could
                     tell him this, it would take away such a sore feeling! But pshaw! it's no
                     matter—what are you going to wear—or what character will you take, Madeleine?
                     The twentieth will soon be here—only a week!"</p>
                  <p>"That reminds me," says Madeleine, to change the subject, "that aunt Edith has
                     had the widow Neil's cottage nicely repaired, and Leil, they say, goes quite
                     regularly to school, and improves very much. But aunt Edith says she is so
                     queer in her ways. Sometimes she is morose and shy, and will not speak all the
                     time aunt is there, and perhaps, just when she's going, Leil will spring wildly
                     to her—take her hand and almost devour it with kisses. Aunt Edith thinks she
                     has very strong feelings, but does'nt know how to manage them yet. I want to
                     see her very much, and aunt Edith suggests that on the afternoon of your
                     birthday, we might take a drive out there—and after we have been to the
                     widow's, you can show me the place where you met that beautiful unknown of
                     yours—it's in that neighborhood, isn't it?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was well pleased with the idea, because he was really desirous to see
                     Leil, and also, doubtless, because it would be so delightful to look on the
                     closed blinds and leafless trees that sheltered this ideal of loveliness, on
                     whose beauty he had often expatiated to the listening Madeleine.</p>
                  <p>Fitful April, with its clouds and sunshine came at last. But this birthday, so
                     long expected, was <emph>all</emph> sunshine, and at the breakfast table their
                     anticipated pleasure was the only theme. Geoffrey told Ralph he was going to
                     take a holiday.</p>
                  <p>"But in the evening," he added, "we will all be together. I am going to have
                     aunt Edith and Madeleine try and persuade father to come down stairs."</p>
                  <p>Ralph listened, but made no answer, and soon after left for business.</p>
                  <p>But the joy of the young people was much damped by finding that Mr. Luperthorp
                     was not so well that morning. He had spent a restless night; aunt Edith did not
                     like to leave him.</p>
                  <p>"But," she said cheeringly, "You and Madeleine can go, Geoffrey, at any rate,
                     and take a pleasant drive. Do now—I shall feel better if you do." With greater
                     energy she pressed them to go, although the disappointment of leaving her at
                     home, and the depression which Geoffrey experienced in regard to his father,
                     rendered the drive no longer a recreation to be greatly desired.</p>
                  <p>They rode along silently at first; the real enjoyment was <choice>
                        <sic>detroyed</sic>
                        <corr>destroyed</corr>
                     </choice>—they had expected so much. Still, with the blessed aptitude of youth
                     for adapting itself quickly to circumstances, they could not long remain
                     insensible to the charms of that lovely spring afternoon. The air was fresh and
                     exhilarating, and as they leaned from the open carriage, moving rapidly on over
                     the road, their spirits once more rose, and they talked, and laughed, and
                     looked, until they had almost forgotten there were such things as sickness and
                     sorrow.</p>
                  <p>Returning from their long ride out of town, they took the road that led toward
                     the habitation of the widow Neil, passing the stately residence also of his
                     "dream of beauty," as Madeleine mischievously named his nameless
                     acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"But what is this?" exclaimed Geoffrey in alarm, "oh, Madeleine, what is this?"
                     a funeral—hearse—and long line of carriages were slowly moving away from that
                     wide lawn and low railing he remembered so well.</p>
                  <p>He at once stopped the carriage and descended to make inquiries of a group of
                     lookers on. It was the mistress of the house, he was told, to his inexpressible
                     relief; she had died very suddenly.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, poor girl! has she lost her mother," cried Madeleine, "I do indeed feel
                     for her!" And with this saddening incident still in their thoughts they reached
                     home, silent and depressed again as they had left.</p>
                  <p>As they were alighting Ralph came up. He was just returned from the office.
                        He<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5590-00000017"/> looked very pale; so much so
                     that Geoffrey asked him if he was ill. "Only a headache," he answered, with so
                     strange and unnatural a voice that even Madeleine looked at him
                     inquiringly.</p>
                  <p>In answer to Geoffrey's eager inquiries concerning his father, aunt Edith said
                     that he had been rather feverish and excited all the afternoon. She remained in
                     the room, and he had seemed more than usually pleased with her presence,—but
                     now he was quietly lying down, and expressed a wish to be alone. She thought he
                     was asleep.</p>
                  <p>So they sat down silently to supper. All the expected gaiety of the evening was
                     of course given up. Mrs. Dupont came down with an apology from Ralph; he was
                     feeling very unwell, and could not join them. After remaining a few moments,
                     she too retired. It was a mournful ending of the joyfully anticipated
                     birthday.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith had more fears for Mr. Luperthorp than she dared express. There was
                     a marked change in him, she thought.</p>
                  <p>Yet accustomed to regard his slightest wishes, having arranged his table and
                     his drinks for the night, she acceded to his imperative desire to be left
                     alone, assured that he could help himself to whatever was needed and would ring
                     the bell if he wanted farther assistance. Thus they sat, all more or less
                     depressed, when a message came requesting Geoffrey's attendance in his aunt's
                     room for a few minutes. It being somewhat advanced in the evening, the young
                     man, dispirited and weary, bade his aunt and Madeleine good night, and left the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>As he ascended the stairs Geoffrey could not help conjecturing what might be
                     wanted with him. It was an unusual summons. Weeks, and even months frequently
                     passed without other conversation between his aunt and himself than the most
                     formal words of greeting.</p>
                  <p>As the door opened to his slight tap, he saw that Ralph was there; he arose as
                     Geoffrey entered, and paced up and down the floor hurriedly.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont received him in her usual stately manner, but there was a tremor
                     observable in her voice, as she bade her nephew be seated.</p>
                  <p>There was a moment of embarrassment, then she said,</p>
                  <p>"I have sent for you, nephew, to correct a misapprehension—a mere
                     misapprehension, I am satisfied, under which my son Ralph is laboring. Of your
                     principles of honor I have the highest opinion, and I also suppose you have too
                     sincere a regard for your cousin Ralph to wantonly trifle with his happiness,
                     and also that you have too true an appreciation of all he has been to you, to
                     evince a base ingratitude in your conduct toward him."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mother," said Ralph, interrupting this flow of words rather impatiently,
                     "you are mistaken—these things are not matters of calculation."</p>
                  <p>"But they are, my dear—at least in a certain degree," returned Mrs. Dupont.
                     Young ladies do not allow themselves to show a preference unless they are well
                     assured a preference is exhibited for them. It is their privilege not to commit
                     themselves until they become the objects of particular attention."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed," said Geoffrey, much puzzled to make out the bearing of these remarks,
                     "all you say is a perfect enigma to me. I cannot understand what you mean." He
                     did not pay much attention to his aunt's remarks about ingratitude, his
                     obligations, etc., because he considered her as slightly monomaniac on the
                     subject of her own and her son's importance; but he was astonished to see his
                     cousin so disturbed, and turning to him entreated that all this might be
                     explained.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Geoffrey, Geoffrey!" cried Ralph, <choice>
                        <sic>competely</sic>
                        <corr>completely</corr>
                     </choice> unnerved by the intensity of his feelings, and very much unlike the
                     Ralph Geoffrey usually knew, "I could not have believed you so cruel—that you
                     could have so injured me! My heart is broken—my hopes in life are all
                     destroyed. You <emph>could</emph> not but have known how long I have loved—I
                     have worshipped Madeleine—and you have tried by every artifice to take her from
                     me! I have watched your secret manœuvrings—you endeavor to keep out of my
                     way—"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had been trying to interrupt Ralph, but without avail; now he could
                     bear no more,</p>
                  <p>"I will endure this no longer!" he cried angrily, "manœuvring and keeping out
                     of your way, forsooth! There was no occasion for this, I think. If I wished to
                     gain Madeleine's affections, I could make the attempt without fear of you, or
                     any one else!"</p>
                  <p>But seeing Ralph so moved, so utterly in despair, the tender-hearted fellow
                     could not continue in this defiant and exasperated mood; he came suddenly down
                     from his high tone and temper to comfort his cousin, to declare, and explain
                     with eager rapidity in order to soothe most speedily the heartache which his
                     words had rendered more bitter.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, Ralph," he said, pleasantly, "it was all your own fault. You are so
                     silent and stiff, and live so far above us, that we thought you would only be
                     provoked at our everyday nonsense." And as Ralph brightened up he continued, "I
                     can speak for myself, and I am sure I can for Madeleine, that the idea of being
                     lovers never entered our heads. Now cousin, be reasonable—cheer up! I have
                     never deceived you, have I Ralph?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no; I ought to know you better," said Ralph with real emotion, as he took
                     Geoffrey by the hand and shook it warmly. "It was a weak and foolish suspicion
                     that misled me."</p>
                  <p>Ralph was subdued by this unexpected relief from sharp mental pain, to
                     something of the frankness and impetuosity of other young men of his age—and he
                     said, smiling,</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey, you are such a good-looking fellow, and so engaging in all your
                     ways, that I do not think it strange that I should be jealous. I am sure that I
                     have suffered enough in the last three months for my folly. But Geoffrey may I
                     still presume on your good nature—may I, dare I ask you, for the sake of the
                     kindness and friendship we have always felt to each other—may I ask that you
                     will, for a time, have as little to say to Madeleine as possible?"</p>
                  <p>Seeing Geoffrey hesitate, he added with less overbearing eagerness, "Only for
                     the present, of course." "Mother," said he, turning to where she sat in stately
                     silence, "do you think I am unreasonable in this?"</p>
                  <p>"Not at all my son. It is as little as my nephew can do to relieve you from all
                     anxiety. And I am sure he cannot but be grateful to find you so forgiving in
                     this matter—although I am pleased to exonerate him from all intentional
                     blame."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was somewhat confounded at this turn of affairs; but he never
                     attempted to unravel his aunt Dupont's reasoning. He answered coldly, "Well, I
                     think you may trust me."</p>
                  <p>And so the conference ended.</p>
                  <p>When, however, the young man sat down in his own room, and all his willingness
                     to abjure himself in the great pity that had been stirred by witnessing his
                     cousin's overmastering passion, had died away, he began to reflect that he had
                     been too precipitate. Although he might truly affirm that he had never
                     attempted to gain Madeleine's affections, yet when he really came to question
                     all his feelings he found there was something more than a mere regret that such
                     a thing could never be. "And besides," he exclaimed mentally, waxing more
                     impatient as he brooded over it, "are her feelings not to be consulted?" There
                     was truly very little vanity about Geoffrey, but, said he softly, if she had
                     ever so little—the slightest partiality for him, it was hard that their
                     pleasant intercourse should thus rudely be broken up, with no explanation. He
                     must avoid her—when her society had come to be such a pleasure, and then may be
                     she would grow to hate him—she would think him so whimsical. And he actually
                     shed tears of vexation, in his half boyish way, on this the evening of his
                     twentieth birthday.</p>
                  <p>"They had no right to ask this of me," he muttered. "And, forsooth, I must be
                     pleased that I am forgiven! What have I done? But so it has always
                     been—everything has ended thus—<emph>I</emph> am brought up as<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000018"/> the delinquent when they are the aggressors.
                     Ralph feels so much for himself—like a baby that gets its finger scratched—it
                     thinks there never was such suffering!"</p>
                  <p>There was an angry touch of philosophy in the young man's afterthought, a
                     truthful glimpse of the weakness of human nature, that lashed him into a rage
                     more unreasonable for having a very reasonable foundation.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he would go down and dare Ralph—and dare his aunt Dupont—and he would
                     love Madeleine if he chose, and she might love him if she chose—he would not be
                     made a fool of!"</p>
                  <p>But, again he thought, more coolly, "All I have done has been voluntary. If
                     Ralph's intense feelings made me forget all else but to alleviate them, I have
                     no right to make him suffer now. Perhaps I would never have thought of loving
                     Madeleine, but for this!"</p>
                  <p>By degrees his feeling became more calm, and then his mind reverted to his
                     father.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, my poor father, I have not even bade you good night! How unfeeling and
                     selfish I am—so taken up with every frivolous trouble of my own, that I had
                     forgotten."</p>
                  <p>Repentant and quiet, in the changing mood of his warm and enthusiastic
                     temperament, he put on his slippers, and stepped noiselessly down stairs and
                     across the wide hall, to his father's door. This he gently opened, without
                     knocking as usual, lest he should disturb or awake him if asleep. Stepping
                     within, to his surprise he found his father still up, sitting in a chair by the
                     bedside.</p>
                  <p>Cautiously he advanced, and saw that the invalid was sleeping. The dim light
                     from the shaded night-lamp reflecting on the pallid features, made them appear
                     even more ghastly and deathlike. As the son looked on that attenuated figure,
                     wrapped in its loose covering, leaning back in the large chair helpless and
                     solitary, his heart throbbed with the most overwhelming tenderness and pity.
                     "Oh, father!" burst unconsciously from his lips. The scarcely spoken words
                     waked the sick man.</p>
                  <p>"Father," said Geoffrey, "you look so lonely, "may I sit with you awhile?"</p>
                  <p>What spirit of peace was near, in this unlooked-for midnight meeting, touching
                     their hearts with reconciliation and love? "My dear boy," murmured the father,
                     in a low, tremulous voice. Such words as these had never passed his lips
                     before, and they were touching—so touching to his son that he could have sobbed
                     aloud. The weak voice, the gasping utterance, made the words inexpressibly
                     pathetic. When these failing efforts come from one whom we have always looked
                     upon as strong, so strong that we hardly connected them with the idea of
                     sickness or death, there is a sadness in their contemplation not experienced in
                     witnessing the prostration of weaker natures.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey still approached his father hesitatingly, as he said,</p>
                  <p>"I fear you are so much worse to-night, father—do let me stay with you!"</p>
                  <p>Whether it was the deep feeling in his son's voice, or whether the stern
                     organization of that iron nature was giving way with the touch of death, I know
                     not—certain it is the father's heart responded with its first living gush of
                     deep instinctive love, as he answered feebly,</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Geoffrey, yes, I shall be happy to have you near me. Come nearer—nearer."
                     He opened his arms, and the father and son clasped each other in a long
                     embrace, heart to heart, soul to soul, and for the first time in all their
                     lives they knew each other. Geoffrey wept, sobbing with joy and sorrow
                     intermingled, but his father shed no tears: the dying seldom weep.</p>
                  <p>"Father," whispered Geoffrey amid his tears, "can you—will you forgive me?"</p>
                  <p>"Forgive you Geoffrey? What have I to forgive?"</p>
                  <p>"Much, oh, much father—I have been but little joy to you. Oh, I see it all now
                     Do not excuse me, father. I have been silent and obstinate because I thought
                     you misjudged me. I have shut myself up in my pride, and called it proper
                     spirit, and have brooded bitterly over some things I ought to have utterly
                     forgotten." Then with all the earnestness and truthfulness <choice>
                        <sic>of of</sic>
                        <corr>of</corr>
                     </choice> his nature, he told his father with childlike contrition, every
                     thought and feeling of his heart, his disappointments, his struggles from early
                     to later life.</p>
                  <p>"And father," he added, "from this time forward every thought shall be open to
                     you. I will bear your reproofs, and I will be to you all that a son ought. I
                     will, father, indeed I will!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, my boy, it is too late!" said the invalid, "too late! But do not let your
                     fine sensibilities mislead you, or burden your conscience with a condemnation
                     it does not deserve. It is I that have been wrong. Every word that you have
                     uttered, my child, has entered my heart with keenest sting. Yes, Geoffrey," and
                     his features became convulsed as with a great agony, "yes, I have done you a
                     great wrong—a cruel wrong. Yet, perhaps I may be spared to undo it. Be quick;"
                     he said, with some of his old energy flashing out for an instant, "I am
                     reminded we must be up and doing. Not a moment can be spared." The struggle to
                     master his fast failing powers was visible in his countenance, but to
                     Geoffrey's entreaties that he would be more composed he only answered with
                     solemn decisiveness, "If you have any love for me, you will act in this moment;
                     do just as I say. Call Thompson—rouse him from his sleep, and bring him here to
                     me. But stop! let him first put a horse to the small carriage, and have it to
                     the door—in five minutes—not more than five minutes."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did not hesitate. He saw that it was best not to thwart his
                     father—this sudden rousing of exhausted life seemed almost like insanity, or
                     the fever of delirium.</p>
                  <p>The serving man came quietly for orders. Pen and ink were brought, and the
                     trembling hand of the invalid essayed to trace the old familiar characters, but
                     in vain—again it tried, but the grasp was powerless. He sighed: "Here Geoffrey
                     you must do this. Tell my old friend Bernott to come here at once—not an
                     instant's delay. Tell him to bring all my papers. Underscore that ALL again and
                     again. Tell him I am dying, and that death waits for no man, and he <emph>must
                        be here.</emph> And to you, Thompson," he spoke aloud and distinctly, "I
                     will give just one hour to have him here. Have Bernott here in one hour from
                     this, and a hundred dollars shall be yours."</p>
                  <p>When this was over he submitted with-out opposition to Geoffrey's desire that
                     he should lie down and rest. A soothing draught was administered, and for a
                     time he slept very calmly. Geoffrey sat watching by his side with anxious
                     solicitude. The short breathing, the half opened eyes, the hollow rattling deep
                     down in the chest, all gave the impression that his father was dying.</p>
                  <p>The young man was unused to death,—he did not know its signs—but in this lonely
                     night-watch, alone with the passing spirit, he <emph>felt</emph> them. "It may
                     be he is going now," he said, half fearfully, "Oh, aunt Edith, would that you
                     were here!"</p>
                  <p>But he dared not move to summon her; the cold, clammy hand was clasped in his
                     own, and he feared to disturb that painless tranquility. He looked on that
                     face, now so shrunken and livid, once so noble and dignified, with every
                     feature stamped with power, and thought of the years long gone when he had been
                     proud to say this was his father.</p>
                  <p>To his great, his infinite relief, his father opened his eyes, "Ah, I have been
                     asleep," he said, "Is Thompson back?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey explained that he had been gone but a few minutes.</p>
                  <p>"A few minutes! Can it be? It seems to me like an age. But life is made up of
                     minutes, and I must live—how many. Raise me up, Geoffrey—take me to the next
                     room. I will be stronger there. I am stifled—I will be stronger there—I only
                     want more room to breathe."</p>
                  <p>But he sank heavily back as his son attempted to raise him, "Well, never mind,
                     I must wait, wait," said he, and repeating the word he again fell into a
                     slumber. He thus continued, at intervals sleeping and waking. At times he
                     wandered; once he thought Geoffrey was his long departed wife, "Why, Gertrude!"
                     he whispered softly, "are you here? Ah, Geoffrey, it is<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000019"/> you! But you are so like your mother—you always
                     were. Do you know I was vexed because you were not a girl? It would have seemed
                     like having her with me again—but you have her eyes,"—looking fondly into the
                     young face bending tearfully over him,—"yes, her beautiful eyes—that same
                     inward look as though communing with an angel. You are like her, very like her,
                     my child. I feel—I feel" and he whispered the word softly as though to some
                     invisible presence, "I feel that she <emph>is</emph> here—that I look through
                     her eyes—that I feel through her eyes—that I feel through her heart. My, dear
                     child, how I love you!"</p>
                  <p>Again he rested, as in a dream—and he smiled—"Gertrude, my own Gertrude, thou
                     art here! In this sweet calm thy radiance is around me. I will float away in
                     this blissful joy. But you look sad, dearest," and a slight tremor passed over
                     his face—"Is it of Geoffrey, you think?" He started, as if from a powerful
                     shock, to sudden consciousness. "Yes, Geoffrey—is Thompson here?"</p>
                  <p>"Not yet. It is but half an hour, father, since he went."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed the dying man, and strong convulsions shook his
                     frame.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey now rang the bell violently.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was there in a moment. Mr. Luperthorp recognised her. "I am dying,"
                     "Edith, my faithful Edith,—and my poor child." He looked at them more
                     beseechingly, as a flashing thought gave momentary fixedness of purpose, "Call
                     Ralph, call his mother. No—I will write—You write, Edith. Geoffrey press my
                     head, hold my hand—tell them—," the eyes became fixed, "tell them—," he said. A
                     struggle—a long quivering gasp—again and again—and the worn out body was at
                     rest.</p>
                  <p>A few minutes more and Mr. Bernott arrived, and also the family physician, who
                     had been summoned by aunt Edith, but it was all too late.</p>

                  <head type="sub">TOO LATE.</head>
                  <p>THE sudden death of Mr. Luperthorp came like a fearful blow to all his
                     household. Though long looked for, it was unexpected at the last.</p>
                  <p>Death always takes us by surprise: we may have been waiting—waiting—yet in the
                     end it comes upon us unaware. Perhaps we have fancied an improvement, or some
                     dangerous period has apparently been safely passed, or we looked upon the event
                     as so far off—when lo, in the unguarded moment it steals upon us noiselessly.
                     We were not ready, but Death was ready. He has gathered up his prey, so
                     silently, so swiftly, that but for the cold limbs that cannot be warmed, and
                     the glassy eye that fails to distinguish its best beloved, we should hardly
                     know that the shadow of the Messenger had indeed crossed our threshold.</p>
                  <p>In the chamber of death, so hushed, so deeply solemnizing, we wonder to hear
                     the distant sounds of the outside world; the careless laugh, the busy voices,
                     the eager feet passing under our windows shock our high-strung sensibilities.
                     We think that for a brief space all might feel as we feel, sitting awe-struck
                     in the gloom that has gathered around us.</p>
                  <p>So thought poor Geoffrey, as into the stillness of the household intruded the
                     busy hum denoting the newly-awakened energies of another day.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, leave me!" he cried, "Shut out the light. It was here I came to love my
                     father. Let me stay—I want to think over that love, to remember how he loved me
                     at the last. Oh, let me, let me stay!"</p>
                  <p>Those about him wondered at the depth of his suffering. It was the memory of
                     that last interview which stirred all the passionate depths of his nature. Had
                     his father died without this communication of soul, he would, no doubt, have
                     mourned as any other dutiful son, but the grief would have quickly passed. The
                     changefulness natural to youth, new scenes and circumstances, would have caused
                     him to forget his sorrow; a sorrow which now seemed to crush his spirit to the
                     earth, rendering him for the time dead to all other feeling. Even aunt Edith
                     lost her influence to win him from this utter abandonment of grief.</p>
                  <p>With the usual solemnities the funeral took place; the remains of Mr.
                     Luperthorp were deposited in the family vault. The attendance was large, for
                     the family was widely known.</p>
                  <p>The Luperthorps were a highly respectable race, and bore an honorable name—more
                     honorable perhaps from its antiquity than from the marked and glorious deeds
                     which sometimes render a name immortal.</p>
                  <p>They were not a people famous for devotion to any cause, or undue willingness
                     to sacrifice themselves for such. They were reputable, intelligent, wealthy:
                     there was little enthusiasm or momentary impulse, to betray them into other,
                     and as some might think, higher aims. They were satisfied as they were; it was
                     distinction enough to be a Luperthorp. Men and women of entire generations of
                     this family had felt this satisfaction; to them the odor of its name was
                     sacred; in all the amenities and proprieties of life, in all its graver duties,
                     their great thought was to do it honor.</p>
                  <p>And this was a commendable self-respect. If a Luperthorp's name seldom added to
                     the annals of high and noble achievement, it as seldom swelled the lists of
                     dishonor. If they did not assist others in the effort to throw off a degrading
                     yoke, in the early times of their history, they certainly bore with every
                     exaction patiently themselves. Abhorring change, and feeling sufficiently at
                     ease with things as they were, they felt disposed to have the rest of the world
                     satisfied too, going on the principle that whatever <choice>
                        <sic>is is</sic>
                        <corr>is</corr>
                     </choice> right; a very convenient doctrine for those who are all right
                     themselves.</p>
                  <p>They were an unusually fortunate people: circumstances having raised the
                     original patrimony to an almost fabulous amount. Their ideas of justice, also,
                     were strict; rendering to every man his due, and exacting <choice>
                        <sic>rigdly</sic>
                        <corr>rigidly</corr>
                     </choice> a similar return.</p>
                  <p>The laudatory remarks, therefore, pronounced by the officiating clergyman at
                     the funeral obsequies of the recently deceased member of this family, were all
                     unexceptionable, and perfectly correct. He <emph>was</emph> an upright man,—an
                     intellectual man,—a man of much force and power,—withal strictly religious, and
                     living up to the exact observance of the most rigid tenets of his faith. What
                     higher claim to Christian <choice>

                        <corr>eulogy</corr>
                     </choice>, and to the honor of being presented as a shining light, an
                     illustrious example amid perfumes and tears to the tender hearts of the rising
                     youth present on that occasion.</p>
                  <p>Yet—there was something that he was <emph>not;</emph> something which lacking,
                     threw a shade over all these commendable qualities; he was not a man to create
                     human love around him. The veriest blunderer from the heart's crude promptings
                     could do more to charm and inspire to generous emotion, than he in the dignity
                     of his most elaborate efforts. He kept that to himself, and within himself,
                     which if spread abroad would have quickened his own impulses, generating an
                     answering warmth in the hearts of others, making him a truer and a happier man.
                     Not opening to the sunshine without, gradually all grew cold and shadowy
                     within.</p>
                  <p>Our best intuitions are educated by our perception of the outward. The earnest
                     expression of an exalted sentiment stirs our own soul to loftier aspiration. As
                     martial music fires the heart to more heroic daring, as a melancholy minor
                     strain touches it to pity and tenderness, so in all things the outer acts ever
                     upon the inner—the inner ever upon the outer. We cannot be independent of this:
                     as we desire internally, so we receive externally. If, like an oasis in the
                     desert, we close ourselves around with barrenness, doling out our living waters
                     to the stray few—then we must not complain if loneliness and the dearth of
                     sympathy be our lot.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Luperthorp was sincerely mourned by his own family; but outside of that
                        limited<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5590-00000020"/> ited circle not a ripple
                     was stirred in the great onward movement of events. It might be supposed that
                     with one of such wealth, position, natural and acquired endowments, a vacuum
                     would have been created somewhere by his sudden departure, but it was not so;
                     quietly he was laid in his grave, and the world went on without him as
                     naturally as the grasses grew over the place, or rather as they grew over
                     humbler graves,—for the stately and orderly resting place of the Luperthorps
                     ignored anything so plebeian and given to intruding on rules and
                     proprieties.</p>
                  <p>Only his son mourned as one that refused to be comforted. There was much of
                     bitter remorse in his grief; remorse unjust to himself, useless to any. Aunt
                     Edith expostulated with him. She saw that his health must give way; he scarcely
                     ate or slept.</p>
                  <p>"I myself have experienced this extreme of grief," she said, "until I was led
                     to see that even in our most amiable tenderness we may be selfish, and acting
                     very far from right. We ought not to make others unhappy, and oppress them with
                     the weight of our gloom. Ah, my child, have not all enough to bear? Do we not
                     all feel this loss? Must not Ralph and Madeleine suffer—and I, who have lost
                     such an old friend?" The tears flowed fast down her pale face,—"Geoffrey," she
                     cried, "will you add to our anguish this burden of anxiety for you—not even
                     letting us taste the satisfaction of sharing your grief, and being some little
                     comfort to you?"</p>
                  <p>The young man was struck to the heart by the pathetic arguments of his aunt,
                     and more by the pitiful pathos of her face,—"Oh aunt Edith," he said, "is this
                     so? I am ashamed to have been thinking only of myself, forgetting all my
                     friends in recollections that almost madden me—I will at once go to the
                     family."</p>
                  <p>During this time no business had been attended to. The will had remained
                     unopened; from respect to the son's grief all waiving their anxiety to become <choice>

                        <corr>acquainted</corr>
                     </choice> with its contents.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bernott, the legal adviser of the deceased, was often with them. He seemed
                     much interested in Geoffrey, and had many conversations with aunt Edith about
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"He seems to be an intelligent young fellow," he remarked, "and possessed of a
                     good deal of feeling. It is hard—very hard!"</p>
                  <p>What was hard? The death of a father was a sad thing to be sure, but aunt Edith
                     scarcely expected that a lawyer and man of the world would regard it as a
                     hardship to be the inheritor of a vast property, even if such enviable
                     possession came accompanied with mourning and death. Through the frequent
                     repetition of these words, she at last received the impression that perhaps—the
                     thing was possible—Mr. Luperthorp had died insolvent. She ventured to mention
                     her fears, adding that Mr. Bernott need not feel any concern in regard to her
                     nephew. If he had been so unfortunate as by any mischance of his father to be
                     left penniless, she thought he would be able to bear the disappointment
                     manfully.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, my dear madam," said the shrewd lawyer, shaking his head, "there are
                     greater trials to a high spirit than the mere loss of money. Poor boy, poor
                     boy!" And so the subject would drop.</p>
                  <p>At length the day was appointed for the reading of the will.</p>
                  <p>Those interested assembled in that same old family room where we first met the
                     members of the Luperthorp household.</p>
                  <p>There were a few additions to the party now, yet the old room looked empty,
                     chill and desolate this morning. That proud, snow-white head, rising stately
                     above them all, was not there. These figures clad in mourning, and with eyes
                     cast sadly down, seemed the shadows of that pleasant group gathered in the
                     cheerful glow of the firelight at the opening of our story.</p>
                  <p>In the center of the long table lay a pile of papers. From these Mr. Bernott
                     selected the will. He seemed somewhat embarrassed.</p>
                  <p>"It is a trying thing," he said, slowly unfolding the document, and pausing
                     with it in his hand, "a trying thing to speak for the dead. And Mr. Luperthorp
                     was an old and dear friend of mine—the companion of my youth—many, many years,
                     my boy," shaking Geoffrey by the hand, "before you knew anything of this
                     troublesome world."</p>
                  <p>He proceeded to read.</p>
                  <p>There was an ample provision made for Mrs. Dupont, and for his faithful helper
                     and friend, aunt Edith; also for Madeleine, beloved as a daughter. There were
                     no bequests made to servants, because, as the testator remarked with
                     characteristic exactitude, he had always paid them well for their services, and
                     he expected those who came after him to do the same. Some few old friends
                     received trifling tokens of remembrance. After reading some other unimportant
                     items, Mr. Bernott came slowly to the portion for which every listener was
                     anxiously waiting.</p>
                  <p>At the mention of Ralph Dupont's name he hesitated painfully. The family would
                     in future be represented by Ralph Dupont Luperthorp, who had been regularly
                     adopted by law as a son of the testator, and who was hereafter to be known by
                     his name. To him he left the remainder of his immense wealth, subject to a
                     perpetual annuity of two thousand dollars, to be paid yearly to his son
                     Geoffrey, or to his heirs after him</p>
                  <p>The apology for thus doing, (for even the haughty spirit of the deceased felt
                     that an apology might be needed) was, that his son Geoffrey had shown so little
                     aptitude for taking care of money, and for business matters generally, that he
                     feared the youth might become the prey of designing villany. And, furthermore,
                     he had felt it a duty to perpetuate as he found it, the name and dignity of his
                     honored race untarnished. His nephew and adopted son was thoroughly a
                     Luperthorp; for this reason he had been chosen as the representative of a name
                     whose unblemished purity and dignity was safe in his keeping.</p>
                  <p>For his son Geoffrey the father expressed much solicitude, and recommended him
                     to the brotherly care of Ralph.</p>
                  <p>The reading ceased. A painful silence pervaded the room. Everyone felt that a
                     fatal blow had been dealt where no words of healing could reach. Words, indeed,
                     were a pitiful mockery. And yet none there present dared impeach the right of
                     the deceased to do as he judged best, least of all the victim himself. He had
                     not even <choice>
                        <sic>the the</sic>
                        <corr>the</corr>
                     </choice> feeling of defiance to rouse him from that wounded sense of
                     humiliation, that bitter mortification which overwhelmed all other sensations.
                     His father's will with him would be final.</p>
                  <p>But all, even the hardest felt for him. Even Ralph and his mother were moved to
                     pity at sight of this young man sitting statue-like and motionless, bereft of
                     his birthright. It seemed as if the shock had smitten him with insensibility.
                     Yes, he was driven from his birthright as some miserable imbecile or
                     outcast—proud and sensitive soul, what would become of him?</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey," at length Ralph said, approaching him, "you do not blame me in
                     this?"</p>
                  <p>He tried to answer, but his lips trembled, and a ghastly pallor encircled
                     them—the evidence of terrible mental anguish. He could not speak. Waiving Ralph
                     away, he arose and walked to the door. No one opposed his going.</p>
                  <p>He walked upstairs, and his deliberate tread was heard on the floor overheard.
                     It echoed distinctly in that silent room where each one's breath might be
                     almost heard. The oppressive silence, only broken by that monotonous sound;
                     weighed heavily on the hearts that listened. Aunt Edith could bear it no
                     longer; she glided up the stairs, and tapped at the door of the room,
                     "Geoffrey, my own Geoffrey," she whispered, "You will break my heart."</p>
                  <p>But the door was not opened to the kindly and well-known voice.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Edith, bear with me a little," he answered, "just a little longer. I will
                     be with you presently."</p>
                  <p>She returned to her anxious waiting, and heard the steady step still pacing to
                     and fro above. How long it seemed. But at length the step was heard descending
                     the stairs. The door opened and Geoffrey came quietly in.</p>
                  <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5590-00000021"/>
                  <p>He stepped directly up to Ralph. There was no anger in his countenance, as he
                     held out his hand to his cousin in token of good feeling.</p>
                  <p>"We must always be friends, Ralph," he said.</p>
                  <p>"You are a noble fellow," said Mr. Bernott, starting up from the reverie which
                     had absorbed him since the reading of the will, "and had I known you as I do
                     now, that paper should never have been written—at least by me. But I have not
                     been idle although I have been silent. I have thought the matter carefully
                     over—and I am persuaded that this document, your late father's will, could not
                     stand in law."</p>
                  <p>"Not stand in law!" echoed Mrs. Dupont, so perfectly amazed that she could
                     scarcely command her voice. "My brother's will disputed? No sir, that shall
                     never be! A Luperthorp's last testament is inviolate; I am the appointed
                     guardian of this, and rather than its slightest iota should be set aside, I
                     will sacrifice every dollar that my son or myself may ever possess."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bernott made no reply; but Geoffrey said calmly,</p>
                  <p>"You need not fear, aunt Dupont; I shall never be a party to anything of the
                     kind. But I thank you, Mr. Bernott, with my whole soul. I fully appreciate your
                     motive. But sir—but sir—" he spoke rapidly, to cover his emotion, "if this
                     property could this moment be mine, I would not touch it. Its gold would wither
                     me—the bread it bought would strangle me. No, I am done with it now and
                     forever. Not a penny of its wealth will I ever touch. Let whatever claims I may
                     possess be vested in my aunt Edith. And Mrs. Dupont," he said, and the
                     unnaturally calm voice, hitherto restrained from all emotion, quivered
                     slightly, "although you may be the guardian of my father's last testament, you
                     are not, I can assure you—you are <emph>not</emph> the guardian of his last
                     wishes—but for these,—unspoken, but known,—my heart must surely break."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont coldly hoped that her brother's son would not consider as personal
                     anything she had said. She had spoken, perhaps, unadvisedly, but it was
                     entirely in reference to the sacred trust which she felt was committed to her
                     charge.</p>
                  <p>"Of course not;" Geoffrey said. He seemed to have grown into manhood that day,
                     and to speak and act with a decision and clearness older than himself. "I
                     understand, and I hope it will be understood of me, that in giving up the
                     annuity left me by my father, I do it from no childish caprice, or foolish
                     anger—but simply that I may, unaided and alone, prove to you—to everyone that I
                     am worthy of my name."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, young man," said Mr. Bernott. "You are right, and I shall be
                     proud to hear of your success."</p>
                  <p>"But, if I fail?"</p>
                  <p>"Then I shall honor you for the effort."</p>
                  <p>"And aunt Edith, you know you have always endeavored to inspire me with an
                     independent, manly spirit—you would not have me, now that the occasion is
                     presented fail to meet it, would you, aunt Edith?" and Geoffrey sat down beside
                     her, taking her hand fondly as of old.</p>
                  <p>Poor aunt Edith! she seemed utterly overwhelmed in her sorrow. It was long
                     before she could speak; but ever unselfish she struggled with her emotion; she
                     would not add one feather's weight to his heavy burden; and when he whispered
                     in her ear, bending down his face, pale and calm to hers, that he must go—in
                     that moment he must go—the very air of the house stifled him—she answered as
                     calmly, "Yes, Geoffrey, you are right," dropping the hand she had held so fast.
                     "Go, dear child, I trust you wholly. I know you will choose the right."</p>
                  <p>He then shook hands freely and kindly with all. Madeleine's hand he held a
                     moment; he longed to speak to her. The young girl was sobbing as though her
                     heart would break—but he was silent.</p>
                  <p>Promising that he would not take any important step without letting them know,
                     he stepped from the threshold of his father's house. He who had risen that
                     morning the supposed possessor of thousands, the inheritor of broad estates,
                     left the home of his childhood forever—a wanderer—owning ing nothing but his
                     youth and health. Deprived by a strange fatality of what was rightfully his
                     own, he ventured out on the world's broad highway, henceforth to be one of its
                     laborers.</p>

                  <p>THERE are few of us who in looking back at our past lives, may not trace by
                     what slender chances some of its most eventful changes have been brought about.
                     An accidental meeting—an unexpected call—a simple expression—a word—in fact the
                     most trivial matter, occurring at the most unlooked-for time, may change our
                     circumstances, relations, and the whole tenor of our lives, serving as the
                     pivot on which turns our future destiny.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey would hardly have believed that from his desire for a walk on that
                     cold December morning when we first met him, such strange results should have
                     come to pass. Yes, there he stood, the same Geoffrey, but how changed. He, the
                     lately dependent, unpractical dreamer, was transformed into the self-reliant
                     man, choosing and shaping his own course. He, the fastidious daintily-attired,
                     fashionable youth, seemed outwardly as well as inwardly almost other than
                     himself, as arrayed in a full sailor's suit, whose loose and free outlines did
                     not disfigure his well-knit form, and whose jaunty hat shadowed carelessly the
                     deep emotion of his eyes, he presented himself once more at the old homestead
                     to say farewell before setting out on his new and adventurous career.</p>
                  <p>But this change of prospects, though apparently the result of sudden and
                     unforeseen circumstances was in reality the natural climax of a long series of
                     events. So that the accident or incident of meeting poor Leil, the beggar, and
                     the generous pity which caused him in her behalf to give away without
                     reflection all he possessed, only decided a matter which had been long
                     unconsciously working in the mind of his father. To day presented the sharp
                     reality of what had been a dim and scarcely shaped dream for probably many
                     years.</p>
                  <p>To the young man, however, the transition had been sudden. Had he been aware of
                     the nice questions that were being decided by his careless youthful acts, he
                     might have been more guarded perhaps. Perhaps, but it is by no means
                     certain,—it was not in his nature to be calculating, or to wait patiently
                     events. It would have been about equally hard to make Ralph the gay,
                     light-hearted, impulsive youth, as to render Geoffrey the systematic lover of
                     order. Experience only would quiet this exuberance of youthful feeling, turning
                     it into channels of broader, more comprehensive usefulness.</p>
                  <p>We are very apt, as we say, to "quarrel with our destiny," and to feel that we
                     are hardly used when disappointments and trials come; but let us put this idea
                     aside, let us take these things as the hard task is taken by the sturdy
                     schoolboy, as the only way through which to reach knowledge and power; only the
                     stupid whine and cry and sink under the lessons they receive from the
                     master.</p>
                  <p>But poor Geoffrey had yet to prove of what stuff he was made. He was now
                     passing from dreamy youth to the realities of manhood; unformed thoughts and
                     visionary imaginings must now give place to living facts and stern
                     determinations. Life individual and tangible was upon him. There were no family
                     props of wealth or influential friends to hold him up: from these he had
                     voluntarily turned away, and by his own merits he must stand or fall. But youth
                     is sanguine. It feels intensely when suffering is near, but the impression is
                     less deep than in later life. The healing powers of fresh life soon close the
                     wound, and it leaves no scar. Geoffrey had no fears—the world was before him
                     and he was free. This pleasant novelty compensated for many of the minor
                     inconveniences he encountered.</p>
                  <p>Truly he looked well and manly in his new outfit. His countenance always frank
                     and ingenuous was particularly fitting to<pb n="42-43"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000022"/> this easy attire. The blue jacket and trousers,
                     and the tarpaulin hat, heightened the expressiveness of his face and figure, as
                     a judicious frame brings out in bolder relief the peculiarities of a fine
                     painting. Aunt Edith thought as she looked at him, that though he might be
                     often led into error, no base or ignoble motive could ever prompt the spirit
                     that beamed out from that open and honest countenance.</p>
                  <p>He had promised to take this last breakfast with them. Prompt to decide his
                     fate whether for good or evil, Geoffrey had shipped on board an East Indiaman,
                     and they were to sail that day.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith though sorely tried, accepted this almost too severe trial with her
                     usual martyr-like spirit; in the silence of her own soul she whispered, "It is
                     right; I deserve it. Ah, could I tell him what I am, he might give me up
                     without a pang! But no—I cannot do this—let me retain this satisfaction, that
                     he still thinks of me as a just and good woman, even though I do not merit that
                     any good or true thought should be associated with the memory of me."</p>
                  <p>Conscience, or self-accusation, or bitter remembrance had wrought a changeless
                     look of suffering in aunt Edith's face, a sadness which seemed to have become a
                     part of its very outline. So Geoffrey often thought, as he watched the
                     expressive features which had never been otherwise than full of blessing and
                     kindliness to him.</p>
                  <p>Her hand trembled as she buttered that last roll, and poured out that last cup
                     of coffee for him who had sat by her side during the years of infancy,
                     childhood and youth, who had always received her attentions so winningly, and
                     by every manifestation of his beautiful and loving nature had wound himself
                     around and around her affections, till it seemed that the pain of severing that
                     strong cord would rend her very heart. Still she smiled—she that so seldom
                     smiled—and entered into the general conversation. But all were working with
                     effort, endeavoring to touch only on subjects farthest away from their
                     hearts.</p>
                  <p>At length the well-meant gaiety died in an embarrassing silence.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps none had a greater struggle than Madeleine. Geoffrey had treated her so
                     strangely, and had so evidently avoided her since that birthday evening, that
                     she had been alternating between passionate fits of weeping and of anger,
                     interspersed with moods of forgiveness, ever since.</p>
                  <p>She had sometimes resolved to go to him and in their old familiar way ask all
                     about it; but then she would remember that he had experienced a great sorrow,
                     and great disappointment, and it was natural that every person and thing else
                     should be driven from his mind.</p>
                  <p>Oh, she forgave, she pitied him, poor fellow! Still, he might have come to
                     her—he might have known that she would grieve for his suffering. It was hard,
                     indeed it was—almost cruel. And weeping with vexation she would resolve not to
                     care any more for him. This morning she had made up her mind not to come to the
                     breakfast table, but to shut herself in her room until he was gone. Yet—it was
                     the last morning—and he was going so far away, perhaps she might never see him
                     again. It was a good opportunity to show him how indifferent she could be;
                     altogether, she had better go down. She wiped her eyes, and opened the window
                     to let the morning air blow on them; she bathed them in cold water, and used
                     every means she had ever heard of to dispel that inflamed look—but they still
                     gave the impression of a heavy heart and sleepless night, when dressed with
                     more than usual care, and with head more than usually erect, she entered the
                     breakfast-room.</p>
                  <p>Ralph was not, however, at all jealous or offended at the appearance of emotion
                     which Madeleine's countenance betrayed. It was perfectly natural that she
                     should feel very much—had not Geoffrey and Madeleine been as brother and
                     sister? Indeed he felt worse himself than he cared to show. Now that the dread
                     of any interference with Madeleine's affections was abated, he could afford to
                     grieve. Geoffrey had been so generous in this matter, had so respected his
                     feelings, showing no vindictiveness at the sudden loss of fortune and station,
                     that Ralph could not but feel it keenly; and to his honor be it said, he had
                     made some very liberal overtures to his cousin, urging him to remain at
                     home.</p>
                  <p>But the time had come for Ralph to leave; with his punctual business habits
                     nothing was allowed to interfere. Office hours and office duties were
                     imperative.</p>
                  <p>He rose from the table, stretching out his hand to say good bye as he did so,
                     but a choking sensation cut off the words, and the two young men stood a moment
                     thus, hand in hand—then the rushing tenderness of real feeling prevailed, and
                     before they parted they held each other in a close embrace.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont must leave also. She had an early engagement with her lawyer. She
                     bade her nephew farewell with a stately courtesy and pressure of the
                     hand—observing that she should be always pleased to hear of the success of the
                     son of her lamented brother.</p>
                  <p>The three, aunt Edith, Madeleine, and Geoffrey, were now alone. It was almost
                     time that Geoffrey was off. The appointed hour was at hand when he must be on
                     board the vessel.</p>
                  <p>"Madeleine," he said, "won't you speak to me kindly before I go? He took a
                     chair and sat down beside her. "We have not been so good friends as of old,
                     lately, but it was not my fault, Madeleine. I have felt the same toward you as
                     ever."</p>
                  <p>Poor Madeleine! all her dignified resolves about indifference deserted her on
                     the instant, and the tears that had been held back so determinedly, flowed
                     freely and without concealment.</p>
                  <p>"Oh Geoffrey, why have they treated me so coldly? Why have you been so
                     reserved? I have felt that I would rather die than live—we used to be such good
                     friends!"</p>
                  <p>"So let us always be. You will yet, Madeleine, know the reason for my
                     action—and you will not blame me."</p>
                  <p>"But what shall I do when you are gone? I shall be so lonely."</p>
                  <p>"You must let Ralph take my place—you must make a companion of him."</p>
                  <p>"Oh no, no! I couldn't. And Ralph wouldn't care for my society."</p>
                  <p>"Yes he would. He thinks a great deal of you, Madeleine, more than you suppose.
                     But come—that's a good girl—put your arms round my neck, as you used to do when
                     I was going to school, and give me a good kiss, and let me go."</p>
                  <p>Poor girl, she tried to smile, but she was sick and faint. Her lips trembled,
                     and her face blanched, "Oh, aunt Edith, where are you?—I shall die!"</p>
                  <p>They led her to a couch in front of the window, which Geoffrey raised. The
                     fresh air revived her, and aunt Edith laid the young white face on her own
                     sorrowing breast, while Geoffrey rubbed the cold hands and kissed them warm.
                     Ah, mournful hour of parting! Even the old willow by the casement seemed to
                     lament, gathering dismal tears from the morning mist, and scattering the cold
                     drops from its feebly swaying branches, as if in sympathy with the group
                     within.</p>
                  <p>"But my dear children," said aunt Edith, rousing herself from this lethargy of
                     grief, "it is only cruel to prolong this parting. Go, Geoffrey, and leave
                     Madeleine to me."</p>

                  <p>SAD indeed, and more than dejected, was that inexperienced youth, now tasting
                     the firstfruits of his bold experiment.</p>
                  <p>Leaving the warmth of those devoted hearts, he felt truly as if launched on
                     some unknown sea. He the petted, fondly nurtured object of so many home
                     affections, was now out in the world alone. Wherein did he differ from others
                     that he should be saved its rough jostling, and the necessity of battling inch
                     by inch for its right of way? The sun did not hasten forth to shine on him, or
                     the rain cease to bespatter his steps. The idol had stepped down from the niche
                     where the home worshippers<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5590-00000023"/> pers had
                     set him on high, and common men, brushing rudely by in the hurry of business
                     did not recognise him as other than one of themselves.</p>
                  <p>It rained steadily, as it had been raining for the last three days, and the
                     narrow streets, seldom clean, were now horribly disfigured with mud and filth.
                     New York is not exhilarating on a rainy day, especially in those narrow streets
                     leading to the shipping. And on this unfortunate morning Geoffrey's
                     sensibilities were unusually alive to unpleasant impressions. The
                     uncleanliness, the odors, the dreariness sickened him as he passed along. The
                     unseemly people depressed him; every one he saw—men and women, sitting in their
                     little shops, or lolling lazily out of their dingy windows, all, all were so
                     depraved, so colorless, so like the streets they lived in, stationary,
                     wretched, degraded! What a world was it to live in! Hope for an instant died
                     within him; the wild visions of ambition that had stimulated him vanished away.
                     He had not even the bracing influence of opposition to stimulate him. He might
                     go or stay, just as he pleased. Which should it be—should he turn back? It was
                     not too late: they would all receive him with open arms. Perhaps he wavered an
                     instant—hardly that, for planting his foot more firmly, "Turn back?" he said
                     almost aloud, and the bold movement of his head showed how daring he considered
                     the question—"Yes, turn back, to be pitied and taken care of as the helpless
                     imbecile of our respectable family. No! rather die free than live a slave!" and
                     with a determined step he pushed forward. No longer picking his way with dainty
                     steps, he hurried unconsciously on, splashing through mud and rain, under
                     horses' heads, between cart-wheels—stopping not a moment on his way, until
                     finally mounting the side ladder, he stood on board the crowded ship.</p>
                  <p>It was accomplished. He felt a sense of relief and of achievement. The
                     prospect, as yet, was not very inviting. Everything was being crowded on board,
                     wet, and covered with mud; the deck, the rigging, the sails lying about, were
                     all dripping. The actual falling of rain had now ceased but there was that
                     steaming murkiness in the air which is far more uncomfortable. No one, however,
                     save Geoffrey, seemed inclined to notice the aspect of things amid the hurry
                     and bustle, running hither and thither, and the confusion usual to a final
                     departure on a long voyage.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was sent to his quarters in the forecastle. Here it was worse still;
                     all the effluvias from all the docks seemed to have settled in the dark
                     corners, and under the unsightly bunks, penetrating the entire atmosphere of
                     that dark and miserable hole. To his inexperienced eyes it seemed a very
                     pandemonium of dirt and disorder. All sort of traps were thrown in confusedly,
                     boots, coats, caps, cups and plates—each man had something. Floor, berths, tops
                     of chests, were crowded to overflowing. Geoffrey did not tarry long here, he
                     hastened again on deck.</p>
                  <p>In this quarter the confusion was gradually disappearing. As he stood looking
                     over the sides of the immense vessel, and up, still higher up those great masts
                     pointing toward the opening clouds, a feeling of littleness came over him, an
                     impatience of the trifles that had hitherto influenced and fretted him. He
                     shook himself free of the past, and stepping briskly forward reported himself
                     to the mate as ready for duty.</p>
                  <p>That officer was not by any means a prepossessing personage; he nodded curtly
                     to the new hand, but scarcely looked at him, merely saying as he continued
                     giving his orders, "Step aside, step aside, young man, your turn will come by
                     and by."</p>
                  <p>Preparations were making for hauling out into the stream.</p>
                  <p>"All aboard!" was the shout. Anchors were hoisted, cables unloosed, the planks
                     and ladders drawn in, good-byes exchanged,—and cleared of all her moorings, the
                     great ship moved slowly out, and under the guidance of a brace of little
                     steam-tugs glided majestically through the deep waters, out to the noble
                     bay—past those beautiful islands—through the narrows—along the picturesque
                     coast, till with all sails set they launched into the deep waters of the mighty
                     ocean.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was indeed truly enchanted; he forgot all else in the grandeur of what
                     he beheld. He listened to the dash of the waves on the shore that was now very
                     fast receding, he gazed upon the field of immensity they were fast entering,
                     and a feeling of deep devotion stole over him; he could have bowed down and
                     worshipped. "Oh, that I were a poet," he exclaimed, "that I could tune to words
                     all this majesty and sublimity that inspires my soul like the glorious movement
                     of music!"</p>
                  <p>It was an innocent delusion, such as many another youth has pleasantly
                     cherished. <emph>Had</emph> he been a poet, he would have known that words have
                     not yet been found to give shape to the imaginations of the soul.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately for the young sailor, he had not yet been seasick. He had kept
                     mostly on deck, only once having experienced a little qualmishness on going
                     below.</p>
                  <p>After mid-day the weather had changed. There was at present rather a calm, but
                     the wind was veering round. The sun sank at last—a great ball of fire,
                     surrounded by a heavy darkness of dense clouds that bounded the entire western
                     horizon.</p>
                  <p>The deep golden hues of the disappearing luminary sparkled on the rising vapor
                     of the foaming waters, and lit the spread sails into sheets of fire. Gradually
                     it grew dark,—darker,—only that broad belt of seeming flame dividing the inert
                     mass of heavy clouds relieved the gathering shadows of coming night.</p>
                  <p>"That looks well, my young greenhand," said an old tar, stepping from the
                     poop-ladder, whence he had been observing Geoffrey's admiring gaze, "that looks
                     well—but, mark me, there's mischief in it. I can tell you, you will not be many
                     hours older before you'll have a smart taste of your new business."</p>
                  <p>"What makes you think so?" inquired Geoffrey, seeing the old man was disposed
                     to be friendly.</p>
                  <p>"Because the 'old boy' is there. You see that bright band of fire cutting in
                     half that eternal mass of pent fury?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey answered that he did, and that he thought it very splendid.</p>
                  <p>"Well, you see also, standing against its light, those stiff little poles, with
                     their taut streamers pointing to the right and left. Those are what we old
                     Jacks call the devil's banners—and when he raises his standard you may be sure
                     there's hot work ahead."</p>
                  <p>Sure enough. Even while they were thus discoursing, a blast came through the
                     almost oppressive stillness—a sort of advance movement from the enemy.</p>
                  <p>"Aha! Don't you feel that, my hearty? Don't say that old Jacob doesn't know
                     anything! So come along, my lad, let me show you how to lash a rope,—there'll
                     be work enough for us all, to-night."</p>
                  <p>As the evening wore on the wind still freshened, throwing out occasionally a
                     sharp gust, as precursor of what might be expected—making everything rattle as
                     it came whizzing over the ship. Geoffrey, however, rather liked it,—it was so
                     much pleasanter than the dull, sluggish atmosphere that had lately hung over
                     them, that the change was exhilarating. He breathed in the clear salt air with
                     a sense of satisfaction. The changed motion of the great ship was very
                     pleasant, it was not so rolling, more direct, plowing through the waters,
                     throwing off the white spray, leaving its foaming wake discernible even through
                     the darkness of the starless night.</p>
                  <p>Thus it alternated; sometimes the heavy breeze, sometimes the lull, until
                     towards midnight, when the wind gradually became more persistent, blowing
                     steadily on, and before that hour was past they had the whole fury of the gale
                     upon them.</p>
                  <p>It was pitchy dark. The hitherto partially clear sky, was covered with little
                     spiteful clouds, racing, surging one after the other as though belched out in
                     fury by the god of storms. The continuous roar was deafening, every new birth
                     of flying clouds coming forth from the parent mass accompanied by foreboding
                     sounds, and fiercer winds that died away in sighs and groans,<pb n="46-47"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000024"/> as if preparing a requiem over the ruin to be
                     wrought.</p>
                  <p>It was a hard experience for a young sailor, as yet wholly unused to the
                     changeful moods of old ocean. Geoffrey was naturally exceedingly timid, but he
                     had an unbending resolution that stood him in stead during the dangers of this
                     fearful night.</p>
                  <p>All that he could hear was the fierce sound of the trumpet, and the rush of
                     men, followed by the heavy flap of the sail, perhaps torn to shreds ere it fell
                     to the deck, till at last the vessel lay perfectly helpless, an immense hulk,
                     tossed about like a cork on the unceasing waves.</p>
                  <p>The hatchways had been closed at the commencement of the gale, and the breaking
                     waters had a clear sweep from bowsprit to stern. Sometimes a great wave
                     striking the ship threatened to engulph them instantly, making every timber
                     shiver, and every joint to strain, and carrying every loose and ill-guarded
                     thing before it. All that Geoffrey could do was to hold fast to whatever was
                     nearest him, in order to retain a footing; closing his eyes almost in despair
                     when through an occasional rift in the wild clouds, the moon sent down a
                     momentary gleam, rendering the desolation more desolate. Ah, he thought of
                     home, of aunt Edith, of all that loved him there. How little they were dreaming
                     of his danger, who, perhaps, might never see them more! For he felt as though
                     he might at any moment be swept into eternity. Wet, cold and disheartened, he
                     had almost come to be indifferent to death.</p>
                  <p>"Wasn't old Jacob a good prophet?" shouted the friendly voice in his ear—it was
                     the only way to be heard in the incessant din. "But come, my lad," he said,
                     seeing the poor youth's forlorn condition, "Come along with me. You're as safe
                     as on your grandmother's lap by the kitchen fire! A good ship, a clear deck,
                     and the breeze off shore—there's no danger though the very clouds rattled in
                     your face. I like this!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey followed, much relieved. "Every one to their taste," thought he, as he
                     came up with more force than grace against mast, caboose, and every obstruction
                     that lay in his way.</p>
                  <p>Before morning dawned the wind was considerably abated, and by sunrise it had
                     lulled to a stiff, pleasant breeze. There was now plenty to do—sails to be
                     unfurled, damaged rigging restored, decks swabbed dry—with all the clearing up
                     and putting away consequent upon the disorder of a night of storm.</p>
                  <p>The young man had thus an opportunity of seeing his officers. The first mate he
                     did not at all like. To be sure, in his ignorance of all nautical tactics he
                     came at present but little under the command of this man, but the way in which
                     he treated his men awoke in Geoffrey an intense and sudden feeling of dislike.
                     Every order given was accompanied by an oath, or insulting epithet, and he
                     appeared to go on the principle that all men, and sailors in particular, were
                     villains and rascals. who would shirk and take advantage in every way, if not
                     berated and knocked about like brutes.</p>
                  <p>The captain he had not yet seen, but was given to understand by his quaint
                     sailor-friend that this personage was an old hypochondriac, who could not put
                     his nose out of the cabin if the wind gave a puff—"But," added the old tar
                     confidentially, "he knows all that is going on, for all that, and is keen as a
                     nor'wester. Tell ye, now, youngster, you'll haul in yer colors when you get in
                     his wake!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did not pay much heed to this talk; he thought he could best judge for
                     himself. But, altogether, he was discouraged—he was tired and worn out.
                     Seasickness was telling upon him; the long swell of the ocean made his head
                     dizzy, and the pitching and rolling of the vessel all day long kept him
                     bewildered and faint.</p>
                  <p>He had another source of discomfort,—those two young fellows that stood by and
                     laughed at all his mistakes—could he bear it all? He had half a mind to go to
                     his quarters and never come out again—stay there and die.</p>
                  <p>He went down: but had the satisfaction of coming to an understanding with the
                     two young sailors when they came below to supper, shortly after. Stepping
                     boldly up to them he asked abruptly what they meant by laughing at him—it was
                     an insult that he would never endure. It is impossible to say whether it was
                     owing to Geoffrey's determined look, or to their natural good humor—it might
                     have been both—but they at once held out their hands, saying pleasantly,</p>
                  <p>"Beg pardon, comrade, we didn't mean anything—we always hold it fair game to
                     make sport of a landlubber, or greenhand, as we call 'em."</p>
                  <p>Having expended some of his <choice>
                        <sic>irratibility</sic>
                        <corr>irritability</corr>
                     </choice> the young man felt a little more comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Still the new state of things was disheartening to him. He felt repugnant to
                     association with such men. Weary and worn he flung himself into his berth, but
                     there was no rest or sleep for him that night.</p>
                  <p>The first watch had come below, and turned in; he heard them soon in the heavy
                     breathing of sound sleep, and envied them their brief oblivion to what seemed
                     to him now the horrors of sea-life. Thus another hour slowly passed. He was not
                     aware that he had slept, and yet he roused up as if awakened suddenly from deep
                     unconsciousness. He looked around—there appeared to be a faint light burning in
                     that low dusky place. He saw each man in his bunk—he even noticed the caps they
                     had thrown carelessly down, and the heavy jackets they had hung up as they came
                     in. He marked all these particulars, wondering how it was he saw them so
                     clearly. When he went to sleep everything was in darkness—there was not even a
                     dim lantern about the place. Yet the light was increasing—a soft, unflickering
                     light, like the sun-subdued haze of a warm summer day An inexpressible calm
                     stole over him, and a dreamy pleasure, as if he could have lain forever thus. A
                     breath of warm air floated over his face, He looked up: he opened wide his
                     eyes, as if to assure himself that he was actually awake. Was it possible? Oh,
                     do not tell him that he was deceived. There stood his father—solemn and dark,
                     and deeply sad. He looked upon his son with a loving but melancholy gaze. The
                     young man's heart throbbed wildly; his breast heaved and swelled with stifling
                     sighs; it seemed as though his life must dissolve in tears. He longed to
                     alleviate that depth of woe.</p>
                  <p>"Oh father!" he cried, "do not look thus, or I shall die with grief. Oh, smile
                     on me, and I shall be happy. I shall never more complain—I shall be good—I
                     shall be strong—I shall strive for right: for excellence and eminence. I shall
                     strive to be every thing that the son of such a father should be—but oh, smile
                     on me! once more—once more—or I shall die in despair! And father," he said
                     again, as if roused to still further pleading "I feel that it was the right
                     thing for me to be thus put aside from my birthright—the very best thing,
                     father! Oh, I should have been an indolent, self-enjoying idler, without any
                     high sense of the obligations of life, or knowledge of its duties."</p>
                  <p>Thus he plead, and promised, and entreated, as thoughts and words thronged up
                     for utterance. He even rose to eloquence in his overpowering earnestness.
                     Eagerly he watched the effect of all that he said upon the unearthly visitant,
                     and when he saw that gaze of deep sadness passing away, and hope and joy
                     irradiating the face of the vision, his own heart bounded with a joy
                     unutterable.</p>
                  <p>"Father," he whispered, "I thank you for this!"</p>
                  <p>His soul seemed to rise and expand; every cloud vanished, and the shape beside
                     him stood out clear and distinct, enshrouded in its mellow vapor of crystalized
                     light, emanating as it seemed from a lustre within. From that visioned
                     countenance there beamed an ineffable sweetness, as if from the very fountain
                     of love. It rested on the youth with entrancing power; it crept as a soothing
                     ether through his brain, till he lay bathed in a flood of ecstatic delight.</p>
                  <p>The vision vanished. Roused as by a sudden shock from this overpowering
                     sensation of extreme bliss and peace, he found himself again in the dark and
                        confined<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5590-00000025"/> berth, and listened to the
                     deep breathing of the sleeping men around him. But the sense of happiness
                     remained. Very soon a profound slumber stole over him, from which he awoke in
                     the morning calm and ready for his day's work. There lingered with him still a
                     strange feeling of buoyancy—an indefinable sensation which gave an energy and
                     cheerfulness to all his actions; so that when he went out among his associates
                     he no longer met them with shy distrustfulness, but with the free, frank
                     openness of his naturally unsuspicious disposition.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MADELEINE.—RALPH.</head>
                  <p>AUNT Edith had a long task and a serious one to restore Madeleine to calmness.
                     When Geoffrey was really gone, she was in despair—she would not, she could not
                     live—oh, she would be <emph>so</emph> lonely! She thought there never was
                     anybody suffered as she did, there never was anybody had such a trial.</p>
                  <p>And it was a great trial, a heart-sore trial indeed; aunt Edith would not
                     dispute that, "But time will mitigate the pang, my dear," she said, "only time
                     can do it."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no: no, aunt Edith—you do not know how I love Geoffrey, or you would not
                     say so. You know you are old, aunt Edith, and cannot love as I do—I mean,
                     though, in a certain sense," and Madeleine colored and hesitated, as she
                     recollected what these words implied. She had never before thought or spoken of
                     this, and Geoffrey had never thought, probably—he certainly had never spoken of
                     loving her otherwise than as a sister.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine still blushed, as she said hastily, "Excuse me, aunt, Edith; I know
                     that you love him above everything—but—you will understand me—I mean—"</p>
                  <p>"Of course, my dear," kindly interrupted her aunt, hastening to relieve her
                     perplexity, "I understand. Who could misunderstand you, my innocent Madeleine?
                     But while each month and year, my child, will bring relief to your suffering
                     sensibilities, they will only add to mine. This is the difference between youth
                     and age. Each year adds in anticipation and reality something to your life—it
                     only takes from mine. My days of fruition are passed, and all that goes from me
                     is a certain loss, never to be replaced. One after another of these ties are
                     severed, and at last we come to be alone."</p>
                  <p>Ah, dear aunt Edith! Well she knew the dull blank and apathy that would steal
                     over her life when this one joy of her days was gone. Years and years the care
                     of Geoffrey had been the sole delight of her loneliness, it had fed the ardent
                     yearnings of her soul for love. "But it is well," she sighed, "We become
                     isolated in this perfect filling up of our desires—it is perhaps better we
                     should suffer."</p>
                  <p>"Not you," said Madeleine, between her sobs, "not you, aunt Edith! you are so
                     good."</p>
                  <p>"Madeleine," said aunt Edith, almost sternly, "do not say that again. It
                     tortures me—I cannot bear it."</p>
                  <p>The young girl looked up distressed.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be troubled, dear child—it is nothing. Only undeserved praise sometimes
                     seems barbed with the most subtle sting, and conveying the keenest satire. But
                     to return to yourself, Madeleine; your love for Geoffrey must be, as you say,
                     that of a sister. Geoffrey loves you, too—but it is as he has always loved you.
                     His affections are not fixed. I do not mean to say that yours are, either; but
                     he will be out in the world, in varied circumstances that will interest him,
                     and divide his attention, while you, in the unvarying round of home life,
                     might, dwell, and still dwell on this vivid remembrance, until it became your
                     master and idol. This is what I want you to avoid."</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont returned about the middle of the day. She saw at once how matters
                     were; she noted Madeleine's mental exhaustion; her blanched face, her
                     expression of suffering. She did not intend to blame her for this. It was more
                     judicious to furnish amusement that would turn her from her grief.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont was a shrewd, observant woman of the world; but, unfortunately, her
                     world was rather contracted, and embraced but few responsibilities. Dignity of
                     family; the requirements of social life, as connected with a certain
                     position—its style, its opinions, its charities—these were of the highest
                     importance. To live up to an acknowledged standard, governed by strictest
                     etiquette—this was her passion. But we must be just to her; there are few of us
                     alike unconforming and disagreeable on all points, and although the spirit of
                     rule was strong in this lady, yet she could retire from its display very
                     gracefully, if necessary. She had lived many years with aunt Edith without
                     interference in the prerogatives of the latter. At first she had pressed a
                     little, but finding it would not answer had quietly given up. This she could
                     readily do; she must be all or nothing. She could not wear a divided crown, and
                     abdicated the throne accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Her son she had always ruled, and also her adopted daughter. Where she met with
                     no opposition, she could perhaps be as lenient as any. It was only when urged
                     by defiance of her authority that the worst traits of her character were
                     revealed. Neither am I prepared to say that her only motives were a desire to
                     rule, and an overweening determination to make others submit to her government.
                     I think that it is probable she conscientiously desired to do right by
                     everyone, but thought her own way the nearest road to that desirable end. So
                     thought the monster Philip, when luxuriating in the tortures and sufferings of
                     his fellow beings. He was going to save souls; through witnessing these terrors
                     others would be brought to a state of mind which would result in untold good.
                     So all through the world's doings—in its institutions and individuals—and even
                     in minor, everyday matters—we find among the dominant the same idea in greater
                     or less degree. It is for <emph>your</emph> good—it is right—but <emph>I</emph>
                     must be the judge of what is the right.</p>
                  <p>In Mrs. Dupont's appearance there was a certain air of command that we often
                     see connected with the physical build. The upright back, the well-poised head,
                     the strong tension of the nerves, and the firmly cut features of the face, have
                     an impressiveness not unfrequently felt even by those who are far superior in
                     intellect. There was a dignity in her countenance, but the eyes were cold, as
                     though looking out from some chilly depth; so cold, that Madeleine would do
                     anything, submit to anything, rather than have them rest severely upon her.</p>
                  <p>At present they were calm, as she mildly said,</p>
                  <p>"I must beg your assistance, Madeleine, this afternoon. I have just received a
                     note from young Blondenburg—you know he is one of us. His grandfather by the
                     mother's side was a Luperthorp. He and his sisters have just come to the city.
                     They sail to-morrow morning for Europe, and they desire to spend this evening
                     with us. Of course they will come in a quiet, unostentatious way. It will be
                     necessary, however, to open the drawing-room, and have it properly aired. It is
                     damp. You know it has not been opened since the day my dear brother was carried
                     from it. I will have Ruth light a fire—but you are aware I do not allow her to
                     arrange the furniture or touch the ornaments unless I am with her,"—Mrs. Dupont
                     had taken the entire charge of the house since her brother's death—" and as I
                     have some important writing to finish, I would be exceedingly obliged if you
                     would take my place."</p>
                  <p>Madeleine accepted the charge not only with usual submission, but with
                     alacrity; she was glad to get away from curious eyes. If Ruth would attend to
                     the fire that was all the help she needed. It would be a luxury to be
                     altogether alone—she could then cry as much as she pleased, and mourn without
                     question over all she had lost. For even before aunt Edith Madeleine was
                     ashamed to betray the extent of her suffering. She would like to scream out,
                     and walk up and down, and wring her hands,—and this she could do in that great
                     barn of a room. Through its heavy-timbered<pb n="50-51"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000026"/> floors and thick walls no one could ever hear
                     her. So telling Ruth not to come till she called her, she stepped across the
                     wide hall, rendered doubly dark by the sunless sky without, and unlocked the
                     door of the silent room. Opening it slowly the timid girl almost started back
                     with a superstitious dread. There was the great mirror before her, and her
                     imagination repeated all that she had seen reflected in its depths on that last
                     day, the day of the funeral, as she had furtively glanced across from the
                     opposite room over the crowd of solemn faces assembled here, and the pale
                     corpse lying in their midst. Again she heard repeated those meaning words: "Man
                     that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble;" and the deep
                     response of many voices which concluded the impressive services, "Amen, and
                     Amen!"</p>
                  <p>She shuddered—there was such a coldness and mustiness in the air that met her.
                     Yet in a moment she felt ashamed of her hesitation, and walking boldly in,
                     groped her way through the dim light to the windows at the farther end, threw
                     up the sashes, and unbolted the heavy shutters. This did not mend matters much,
                     however, for the windows were heavily curtained, and the opened shutters fell
                     back on a dead brick wall. This was always a dismal apartment, seldom used
                     except on formal occasions. Mr. Luperthorp's library opened into this room,
                     which was doubtless another reason that the family seldom invaded its gloomy
                     precincts.</p>
                  <p>This morning it seemed like a very desert into whose silence no traveler could
                     venture without a shudder. The drizzling murky day of early spring looked
                     gloomily through the casements—even the old garden seemed desolate and dismal,
                     struggling in vain to overcome its difficulties and wear a comfortable aspect.
                     The high walls around shut out the air and sunshine from its old age—the
                     sunshine that sported so freely and fully and grandly with its youth. The old
                     trees, gray and shrivelled, had scarcely thrown out a budding leaf; the bushes
                     and vines were drooping and forlorn; and the prim flower beds and mouldy
                     pathways and rotting trellises were all calling for the air and sunshine they
                     could not have to dry and warm and invigorate them once more.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine closed the window quickly as the steaming fog came in, covering the
                     mirrors, the polished furniture, the superb paintings, and the groups of
                     statuary with its thin misty damp. It was a rich room this, and filled with all
                     rare and elegant things, but it was low, and large and clumsy, only absorbing
                     into its dreariness what was intended to remedy its defects, and giving out
                     from all the beauties clustered there not one ray of cheer or true
                     heart-warmth.</p>
                  <p>The library did not look more inviting, but she hastened through with the
                     arrangements of the drawing-room in order to have opportunity for a few moments
                     there. It had been held sacred to Mr. Luperthorp alone, and in it he had spent
                     many of his hours of retirement. Madeleine had never been in it half a dozen
                     times, and standing at its entrance she hesitated, as though its old occupant
                     were still within. Slipping gently across the thick carpet, she seated herself
                     in the chair where he had sat—a bright scarlet leather-covered chair—and
                     resting her arms on the wide table before it she sobbed to the full measure of
                     her woe.</p>
                  <p>Just opposite to where she sat hung a full length portrait of Geoffrey when a
                     boy. He had just seemed to come in fresh and rosy from a garden path, a
                     favorite bird on his finger, and a little dog frisking and jumping at his
                     heels. It was a very life-like picture—happy, childlike, flushed with
                     exercise—just as a happy boy might look on a pleasant summer day. It hung
                     beside a niche in the wall, closed up by an oaken door very dark with age, as
                     were also the wainscoting and the numerous bookcases built around the sides of
                     the apartment. That door was partly open now—might she look in? She stepped up
                     to it. She had often heard what was enshrined there, and now she felt a strong
                     desire to see it. Opening the door a little wider, a fair and lovely girl
                     smiled down upon her. She knew whose portrait it was. She would have known
                     Geoffrey's mother without being told, there was so striking a likeness between
                     mother and son. Would Geoffrey ever lose that clear open look, she wondered?
                     Would he become the hard, weather-beaten man of iron for the iron work destiny
                     seemed to have cut out for him? Oh, he had to work now! ah, it was too bad—it
                     was shameful! And Madeleine closed the door reverently on that girlish face
                     which had been an old man's idol. She sat down in the same chair again in
                     distress. It gave a strange feeling, this communing with the dead and mourning
                     for the living. She felt as if shut from the world, so dreamy, so impressive
                     was the silence around her; and when a loud knock sounded at the door of the
                     drawing-room, and a voice said that Mrs. Dupont wanted to see her upstairs, she
                     trembled and started as though she had been indeed summoned from the tomb.</p>
                  <p>In the evening young Blondenburg and his sisters arrived.</p>
                  <p>The young ladies were lively and agreeable. One of them had quite a spice of
                     coquetry about her, ready for a gay flirtation with any young gentleman whoever
                     he might be, that chanced in her way. She even essayed to try her blandishments
                     on the grave and reticent Ralph Luperthorp; but Ralph was not a very pliant
                     subject, and she soon gave up the attempt.</p>
                  <p>Young Blondenburg was a gay, light-hearted fellow, full of hopeful
                     expectations. His mirthfulness was contagious; even Madeleine lighted up. He
                     was evidently quite charmed with her appearance—she looked so girlish and sweet
                     in that long black dress, just low enough to show the black chain and cross on
                     the fair white neck,—and then those ringlets, he had never seen such
                     ringlets—so shining, so beautiful in color.</p>
                  <p>Ralph thought she had never looked so well, the traces of recent grief gave
                     more character to her features and countenance—he was secure,—was complacent,
                     and Mrs. Dupont was satisfied. Altogether matters went on quite pleasantly.</p>
                  <p>It was only when Madeleine attempted to sing a very simple song, at Mr.
                     Blondenburg's entreaty, that her feelings gave way, and in the midst of the
                     strain she fell into a sudden fit of weeping. It was a farewell chaunt. The
                     young man was amazed and wounded. What had he done—would she explain—was it too
                     much for her delicate sensibilities?</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont apologized: "We miss so much a young member of our family—the son
                     of my lamented brother. You know he sailed to day."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, that is natural. Accept my warmest sympathies, Miss Madeleine. He must
                     have been very near to you indeed, you have been together so many years. Wish I
                     could have seen him myself—he is a fine young fellow, I hear."</p>
                  <p>"He is, indeed," said Ralph, warmly, "a fine young fellow, and we are all very
                     much attached to him."</p>
                  <p>The wind was very high that evening, so much so that its ominous voice even
                     attracted the attention of the gay guests in the drawing-room. As they took
                     their departure at a late hour, and the great hall door stood open a moment,
                     awaiting their egress, so fierce a gust swept in that they were all for a
                     moment driven back.</p>
                  <p>"Where, ah, where is Geoffrey, this terrible night?" whispered Madeleine to
                     herself.</p>
                  <p>This was the time when Geoffrey experienced his first great fear, and felt that
                     he was indeed trembling in the balance of fate—would it be life—would it be
                     death?</p>
                  <p>Madeleine shivered as they returned to the drawing-room, and crouched close to
                     the fire, "Oh, this is fearful!" she could not help uttering aloud. "Poor
                     Geoffrey! what will become of him, out on this dreadful night?"</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow," responded Ralph, "he has been much in my thoughts to-night."</p>
                  <p>Wonderful is the power of true sympathy! No studied artifice, had it been ever
                     so well-planned, could have so forwarded his interests with Madeleine, as this
                     simple expression. She looked up in his face with perhaps the first real,
                     kindly feeling she<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5590-00000027"/> had ever
                     experienced toward him, and under the inspiration of that look he kindled to
                     generous affection. He even, in that moment, felt a brotherly love for
                     Geoffrey, and regretted the necessity there was for his absence.</p>
                  <p>As Madeleine earnestly regarded his countenance in the quiet of this new
                     confidence, still dwelling on the same loved theme, she began to perceive quite
                     a marked resemblance between Ralph and his cousin. There were the same
                     features, the same complexion, and now, under the influence of this newly
                     awakened kindness for the absent wanderer, and this happiness in Madeleine's
                     glance of approbation, he wore in a brief moment's inspiration almost the same
                     expression of goodness and truthfulness that beamed in Geoffrey's
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine stopped at aunt Edith's door to say good night ere she retired to
                     rest. It was now just past midnight. The wind echoed through the halls, and up
                     the stairways of the old house. So strong, so sheltered, yet it trembled in the
                     mad riot of the unmerciful blast.</p>
                  <p>She found her aunt walking the floor, her hands clasped over her head, as
                     though endeavoring to shut out this awful sound. The young girl became strong
                     at the sight of another's anguish, and took up the office of comforter.</p>
                  <p>"Dear aunt Edith," she said, "you must come with me—come to my room. It is more
                     sheltered there. And—it may not blow so fiercely where <emph>he</emph> is, you
                     know,—these fierce storms, I have heard, do not often cover a large <choice>
                        <sic>circnit</sic>
                        <corr>circuit</corr>
                     </choice>. Come, do come, aunt Edith!"</p>
                  <p>And the early dawn found them watching together still, in Madeleine's little
                     room.</p>
                  <p>The storm had swept by with the night. Morning brought sunlight and hope once
                     more, and the faith that their absent one was in safety. A buoyant feeling that
                     however far he might wander they would certainly meet again in the future,
                     entered their hearts, to abide there unchanging during the long years of
                     separation.</p>

                  <head type="sub">VOYAGE OF THE AURORA.</head>
                  <p>AFTER the heavy gale encountered by the good ship on the first night of its
                     voyage, the weather became comparatively fine. They experienced no more severe
                     storms, and reached in safety the port of Liverpool.</p>
                  <p>At this port the Aurora touched merely to complete its cargo, sailing thence
                     direct for Calcutta.</p>
                  <p>During the short voyage from New York to Liverpool, Geoffrey had opportunity to
                     become acquainted with the different persons among whom he would be thrown for
                     so long a time. The captain he saw but little, old Jacob assured him that he
                     would see more of him when they got into tropical regions—he was afraid of the
                     cool air of these northern skies.</p>
                  <p>This captain was half owner of the ship; a person whose wealth and importance
                     gained him the privilege of doing pretty much as he pleased on board. The first
                     time our young sailor saw him he had come out in the sunshine, wrapped and
                     muffled to the very eyes. Geoffrey noted with an uncomfortable sensation those
                     eyes, black and sharp, peering out of the mountain of mufflers. When he felt
                     their glance upon him he experienced an unpleasant thrill. He did not wonder at
                     the saying among the men, that the captain's organs of vision were so prying
                     that they had bored holes through every plank of his cabin, and he could see
                     every man of the crew as well as though he was out on deck with them. So strong
                     did this notion become in Geoffrey, that whenever he came in a line with that
                     cabin he would involuntarily shiver, as if those eyes had shot a dart right
                     through him.</p>
                  <p>The first mate was the real commander of the ship. He and the second mate, "old
                     Jacob," as the sailors called him, and a man who was a sort of personal
                     attendant on the captain, were the only old hands on board. The crew had been
                     all shipped anew for the voyage. It was rumored among the sailors that no men
                     could be got to ship aboard the Aurora a second time. The vessel, it was
                     certain, had a bad name, and was shunned by the better class of seamen. Her
                     crew appeared to be almost entirely made up of the roughest and most degraded
                     of their craft, mingled with a few inexperienced hands.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey could not tell whether these men were really by nature "dare-devils,"
                     or whether it was the peculiar government exercised over them which made them
                     such.</p>
                  <p>In the management of people we may be forever stimulating the worst features of
                     their characters, or we may, by a wiser course, be always appealing to the
                     best. Suspicious, distrustful, expecting baseness and deception, we are very
                     apt to find what we anticipate; to sink the good, and bring<pb n="54-55"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000028"/> the evil to the surface. So it seemed to
                     Geoffrey in this case. It could not but be admitted that the men grew worse
                     instead of better. There had to be the given amount of watching, swearing and
                     punishment, or nothing was done. They seemed to prefer wrong to right, and
                     thought it about the best sport they could have to thwart their hard officers;
                     he being considered the likeliest fellow who could cause them most vexation,
                     yet so manage that no vengeance fell upon his own head.</p>
                  <p>Where there are numbers obliged to be together for any considerable length of
                     time, they generally form into knots or groups for association. It may be
                     congeniality, or taste, or age, or any other cause—but these groups
                     instinctively separate themselves from the rest, know each other best, and
                     prefer to be together. So in the ship, a few men would mess together—others
                     would do the same. There was another young "greenhand" aboard to whom Geoffrey
                     was much attracted. It was not difficult to perceive by his address and
                     appearance that he was quite as much out of a true place there as our young
                     friend. A decidedly gentlemanly, handsome young fellow he was, as far as form
                     and features were concerned, but there was a want somewhere—a want of energy,
                     it might be, that gave a <choice>
                        <sic>vascillating</sic>
                        <corr>vacillating</corr>
                     </choice>, purposeless expression to his countenance and movements, causing a
                     feeling of pain rather than admiration in looking at him.</p>
                  <p>The young men were naturally drawn together. No doubt their similarity of age
                     and education, their ignorance of ship life,—being equally the butt of good or
                     ill-natured pranks—sent on all sorts of impracticable errands—ordered aloft to
                     help each other brace a sail that never existed—sometimes scolded for their
                     ignorance, or else laughed at for their innocence—and much more in a common
                     cause of suffering, served to unite them more closely. But with Geoffrey there
                     was excited a feeling of commiseration for his companion. A glance could tell
                     what had brought the unfortunate young man to his present position, and it
                     revealed so much of weakness—pitiable weakness—that kindness urged Geoffrey in
                     his friendship, much more than the spirit of commendation.</p>
                  <p>There is a wrong-doing from which the high-minded, however impulsive,
                     instinctively shrink, because it seems to be born of the wickedness and
                     extravagance of all that is vile, and of a nature essentially degraded and
                     impure. But there is also a wrong-doing which arises from want of power to
                     resist a combination of unpropitious circumstances, or rather, perhaps, from a
                     disposition so yielding and unreflecting that present attainment of joy and
                     ease gratifies all the cravings of such limited natures. Wishing to have only
                     smiles on the faces of those around them, they cannot endure a present
                     sacrifice to ensure a permanent future good. Such appeared to have been the
                     case with this young sailor. Yet, spite of the evidences of premature decay,
                     consequent upon a life of thoughtless dissipation and self-indulgence, there
                     was such an expression of candor and amiability in his countenance as won its
                     way right to the heart.</p>
                  <p>He had told Geoffrey in the early part of their acquaintance, that Weston, the
                     name by which he was known among his shipmates, was not his true name. His own
                     he had degraded, he said, by his selfish folly, and he had resolved that if he
                     could not redeem that name in honor, and so live as to make amends for the
                     grief and anxiety he had caused his family, they should never hear from him
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"But is that fair, Weston," interposed Geoffrey, "to still punish your friends
                     by keeping them in this anxiety about you?"</p>
                  <p>The tears ran down the poor fellow's cheeks—he was undecided.</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps it is not," said he, at length, "and if I had a mother I could not do
                     it,—but the rest had better think me dead. Still, as you say, if they knew I
                     was really dead, then they could give me up—but being uncertain, and imagining
                     all sorts of things—it <emph>would</emph> be better to let them know about me.
                     So if I get well through this voyage, and prospects look bright ahead, I will
                     write to them."</p>
                  <p>The other two men who messed with them were of a very different stamp. They
                     were regular sailors, hardy and active—a pair of rollicking, fun-loving
                     fellows. These were the two who had laughed aside at Geoffrey's discomfiture
                     when his awkward blunders were roughly reproved by the mate. To the casual
                     observer they appeared much alike in temper and taste; but nice discrimination
                     easily detected marked shades of difference. Fred Tilton, as he was familiarly
                     called, was an active, simple-minded, good-hearted youth: he did his work well,
                     and when that was through fun and frolic were the great business of his life.
                     He had a keen appreciation of wit, and was always ready with a quick repartee,
                     but there was no malice in his jokes, and they were generally forgotten as soon
                     as uttered. Noise, confusion, and boisterous merriment were his delight, and to
                     enjoy them he was sometimes led into the wildest scrapes. Fortunately he was of
                     good disposition; he would not wantonly injure the most insignificant thing,
                     and was inclined to think well of everybody, taking it for granted they were
                     what they appeared, being averse to the trouble of looking beneath the
                     surface.</p>
                  <p>But Simpson, his chosen chum and companion, although as fond of mirth and
                     frolic, had a very different basis for his motives of action. He was deeper and
                     more calculating in all that he did. He possessed a lively sense of the
                     ridiculous, rather than an apt perception of wit. With him persons, not ideas,
                     were amusing. Odd combinations, personal peculiarities, mortifying mishaps, the
                     alarms of the timid, the disappointments of the expectant, were to him abundant
                     food for sarcasm and the sources of an ill-natured pleasantry. Withal he was
                     proud, irascible and suspicious—an extremely unpleasant character. Yet,
                     not-withstanding, he was a person of unusual powers of fascination—far beyond
                     Tilton in capacity of pleasing. He knew how to manage himself, had more general
                     intelligence, and could be the companion of the most serious moments, as well
                     as of the gayest.</p>
                  <p>This man in fact possessed large sympathies, and could be stirred to generous
                     emotions, and but for the bitter vindictiveness he sometimes exhibited would
                     have been a desirable companion, yet pride and envious jealousy were his
                     masters, and combined with lack of moral stamina made him rather a dangerous
                     one.</p>
                  <p>However these four together made a very merry company, and when they were
                     sitting at their mess below, or smoking their pipes after watch was over, their
                     lively talk and jolly laugh, and the droll jokes perpetrated in the overflow of
                     their young fresh spirits, were really inspiring, and all the stray idlers
                     about would gather round to enjoy the sport.</p>
                  <p>Among those whose idle time came with their own, and who generally joined in
                     the group of listeners, was one much older than themselves, an unusually large
                     and powerful man. His countenance at first sight produced rather an unfavorable
                     impression; the heavy eyebrows were darkly drawn over deep determined eyes, the
                     face was clumsy and coarse, and the hard weather-beaten skin was scarred and
                     striped with many a furrow.</p>
                  <p>But there was a great deal of human power about him; one of those natures that
                     convey to others a silent sense of force and strength, yet whom a woman or
                     little child would not be afraid to trust in the fiercest and most defiant
                     moods.</p>
                  <p>From the first Geoffrey had been attracted to him, although the man himself had
                     made no advances. Among his shipmates, from his silent and morose habits he was
                     known by the name of Surly Pete.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps another cause of the kindly feelings of Geoffrey toward him was the
                     unmeaning persecution with which the chief mate pursued this individual. He
                     seemed to hate the man with an untiring hatred, and yet it was evident that he
                     was afraid of him. The hardest duties were put upon him by the mate,
                     accompanied by language such as no one possessed of any soul could endure, and
                     yet when the much insulted man would look steadily at him in the excitement of
                     his feelings, the eye of<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5590-00000029"/> the mate
                     drooped, and he quailed in spite of all his efforts. His only resort then was
                     the oft-repeated low muttered menace, "I'll subdue you yet—by all that's
                     righteous I will."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey soon had it in his power to show something of the kindly regard he
                     felt to this usually undemonstrative man. He was taken suddenly and seriously
                     sick, yet was ordered as usual to take his night watch on deck. Geoffrey
                     managed to slip into his place. It was fine clear weather, and there was
                     nothing to be done, and when the watch was over he sat beside the sick man the
                     remainder of the night, bathed his burning head, and gave him cooling drinks.
                     For the next three or four days every spare moment he devoted to the sufferer,
                     and was astonished to find under his roughness so gentle a nature—so
                     appreciative of the smallest act of kindness. From that time forward Geoffrey
                     and Sulky Pete became fast, unwavering friends.</p>
                  <p>In a short time Geoffrey became more reconciled to his position. It is the
                     privilege of the young to easily adapt themselves to new circumstances, and he
                     was attaining more confidence and self-reliance. Being thrown upon his
                     resources, and braving some of the perils of life, awakened a force and power,
                     and an energy to meet its emergencies which he had never before recognised in
                     himself. The sharpness and quickness on ship-board, the prompt execution of the
                     word of command, were all excellent discipline for his dreamy, slow habits of
                     thought so long indulged in.</p>
                  <p>Altogether he was becoming well satisfied with himself and others too. At first
                     his sense of delicacy and his ideas of refinement were often shocked by this
                     motley mixture of nature's rough handiwork, but gradually he was becoming
                     accustomed to it. He found a great deal of warmth and heartiness, much honor
                     and must generosity. He determined while among them to be, as far as his
                     self-respect would allow, one of themselves, with no attempts at superiority of
                     any kind. On the whole he got along very well, and was much liked by his
                     messmates, and by some with a strong attachment. Sulky Pete and old Jacob loved
                     him as a son, and his younger and more immediate associates thought him a real
                     fine fellow.</p>
                  <p>Their stay at Liverpool was very short. The additional cargo was put on board
                     as quickly as possible, and they were again ready for sea. They also received
                     here two passengers for India. One was a middle-aged woman whose husband, a
                     mechanic, had been many years in the employ of the East India company. He had
                     recently died, and his widow was going out to look after his effects. She made
                     no secret of her business, and every one soon knew all about it. The other was
                     a young lady, at least so she appeared from her style and air, and the delicate
                     lightness of her slender person, but her face was closely veiled. Her manner
                     gave the impression of a lady, yet she occupied a place with the poorest woman
                     in the second cabin; beside there was no attendant or luggage; she came on
                     board alone, with merely a small trunk that a lad carried.</p>
                  <p>Of course there was an agreeable variety of conjecture among the crew, but they
                     were soon obliged to get to work again, and the vessel sailed on her long
                     voyage.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A TRAGEDY ON SHIPBOARD.</head>
                  <p>A LONG voyage, where it extends to weeks and months, becomes at last, no matter
                     how numerous and ingenious the expedients for passing time, a tedious and
                     monotonous affair. And when most of the time the voyager is exposed to the
                     burning heat of a tropical sun, shining down on the everlasting waste of
                     waters, scathing the brain, scorching the eyes, enfeebling the body with a dull
                     lassitude, the weight of the slow hours gets to be almost unbearable. Oh, for a
                     blast of cool, invigorating, frosty air, to stimulate into energy once more the
                     exhausted powers of the body! This comes to be the haunting thought all through
                     the day and all through the night. Like the dreams of a famished man, in which
                     delicious viands are spread before him, and groves of fruit trees, and fields
                     of grain offer their plenty to his lips, so under these rays of intensest heat,
                     and through the oppressive moisture of this sullen atmosphere, imagination is
                     forever sporting amid everlasting snows, and fields of impenetrable ice, where
                     the sunbeams have as little effect as affection on an insensible heart.</p>
                  <p>After leaving Liverpool, and before arriving in warmer latitudes, a constant
                     succession of slight gales accompanied them. Perhaps this freakish weather
                     irritated the mate, or perhaps, which is more likely, with the increasing
                     distance from all ports he felt more irresponsible in the use of power—certain
                     it is that he grew more severe than ever, indeed conducting himself sometimes
                     as though a very demon possessed him. Of course he was the constant theme of
                     conversation below, and his name was often uttered in connection with
                     imprecations and threats.</p>
                  <p>"To my thinking," said old Jacob one day, after listening to these
                     denunciations, caused by some new outbreak on the part of the mate, "To my
                     thinking all this trouble is your own doing, in the main—you must be forever
                     showing your gun-powder, and when he sends fire an explosion will surely
                     follow."</p>
                  <p>"Confound him, who cares?" they all exclaimed, "We're not his dogs—we'll let
                     him see he shan't rule us."</p>
                  <p>"Well then, take the consequences. I've lived with that man fifteen years, and
                     we still get along without much trouble."</p>
                  <p>"But you're a mean old hound," said one young sailor, "You'll bear
                     anything."</p>
                  <p>Jacob proceeded without heeding the interruption, "I'm old, somewhat, and my
                     experience has told me, that if you do your duty, and keep cool, you will soon
                     get to be master of the greatest bully. No one, be he in ever such a rage,
                     takes much satisfaction in beating an unresisting man. Where there's no
                     remembrance of oath for oath, or surly looks, or obstinacy to excuse their
                     devilish ferocity, then if theyv'e a heart or conscience such men get a twinge
                     of shame when they least expect it."</p>
                  <p>"But our master-mate has neither heart nor conscience," interrupted the young
                     man, in a high, excited voice.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind," answered the honest old sailor, "God Almighty made us all
                     alike—there's a place for 'em, any way, and I'm thinking a time's coming when
                     we'll feel awful bad if it's not comfortably filled. That man <emph>has</emph>
                     a heart and conscience—and it's all the harm I wish him when it knocks so loud
                     he'll have to hear it. And my young chap, you have a heart and conscience
                     too—and it'll tell you you didn't do the right thing to speak as you did a
                     minute ago to an old gray headed man like me."</p>
                  <p>"Bravo, Jacob! you're right! Go at him!" cried a chorus of voices, while the
                     culprit sat looking guilty enough; the hot blood showing even through the
                     swarthy cheek.</p>
                  <p>"It's a shame!" added his messmates. mischievously, "we must have an
                     apology—down on your knees, Bob Rutherford!"</p>
                  <p>"Stop!" said old Jacob, with a decision none could misunderstand, "I'll have no
                     apologies. I don't hold to 'em. If a man does me wrong, an apology won't help
                     me. It may help him, maybe—ease his conscience a bit, and make him humbler—but
                     it won't help me. All I want is if any one offends me they'll be careful not to
                     repeat the offence."</p>
                  <p>As had been predicted, as the weather grew warmer and they began to feel the
                     influence of a tropical sky, the captain showed himself a little more
                     frequently, although still enveloped in his manifold wrappings. He walked from
                     his cabin out on the quarter-deck under the awnings for an hour or so every
                     day. He never spoke to any of the men at these times—if he had any directions
                     to give he did it through the mate. It was evident however that he noted
                     everything that was out of place, or the slightest neglect of discipline; and
                     so nervous did his presence make the men on these occasions that the stoutest
                     would not unfrequently drop whatever they had in<pb n="58-59"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000030"/> their hands, or make a mismove of some kind,
                     then provoked and excited at their imbecility they would be ready to knock any
                     one down, the captain in particular.</p>
                  <p>Once in a while an appeal had been made to him in regard to the exactions of
                     the mate; but it was found that he was aware of and endorsed all these
                     proceedings. Indeed he seemed to have every movement in the ship mapped out
                     before him, and to take note of all that occurred, as vigilantly as though
                     possessed of the most vigorous health. He appeared to have great executive
                     powers, every department was systematised by rule, and any deviation from this
                     rule admitted of no apology. Thus they found out to their great astonishment
                     that every transaction since coming on board the ship was placed on the great
                     book of accounts without those mitigating circumstances that might somewhat
                     have excused the acts of insubordination.</p>
                  <p>Surly Pete, with the captain as well as the mate, seemed to be a particular
                     mark for severity; not that there was any remissness in regard to duty, for he
                     was one of the most prompt and thorough seamen on board, but he could not be
                     cowed under; all the punishments that ingenuity could inflict he would
                     apparently disregard, and threats were utterly lost on him. They might have
                     proceeded to compulsion, but strange to say, they dare not, there was something
                     about the man that made them hesitate.</p>
                  <p>He was repeatedly, as a last resort brought before the captain; this only
                     engendered more hatred, and brought no submission.</p>
                  <p>"Are you aware, Sir," the captain would say, "that your example on board this
                     ship is subversive of all order?"</p>
                  <p>"I am not, sir."</p>
                  <p>"You pay no attention to any commands."</p>
                  <p>"But they do not give a command that a man can obey."</p>
                  <p>"But you shall obey. By all that is holy I'll make you obey me!"</p>
                  <p>"We shall see," was the quiet response.</p>
                  <p>"Yes we shall see. We shall see who will be master on board this vessel. I
                     shall have you lashed like a dog, you infernal scoundrel—to defy me to my
                     face!"</p>
                  <p>"Have a care, captain, don't try that," said the strong seaman, raising his
                     immense but rather stooping figure to its full hight. "I have warned you once
                     before."</p>
                  <p>"This is mutiny—you are threatening a superior officer. I'll have you strung up
                     on the instant!"</p>
                  <p>"Keep cool; there's no harm done," said the imperturbable man,—"nor will there
                     be, if you are wise; but remember,—I have said it," and his dark eyes flashed
                     fire, "the first arm that lays its weight on me, shall never lay its weight on
                     another. So be warned."</p>
                  <p>"Out of my sight!" cried the infuriated captain. He ground his teeth in his
                     rage. "The scum of the earth!" he muttered, with a deep oath, so low, so
                     intensely suppressed, that only his own ear caught the sound. "I'll make him
                     bite the dust! I will—or my own soul shall pay the forfeit!" Prophetic words!
                     How madly he rushed to his doom!</p>
                  <p>A wise ruler seldom puts himself in a position where he can be defied. He
                     avoids letting his subordinate become aware of his own strength. But Captain
                     Eldrich was very far from being a wise ruler. To him all men beneath him were
                     alike; they must be governed alike, and the opinion he had of them was most
                     contemptible. It was an opinion that every noble mind would rise against with
                     indignation. It was an opinion that men striving to attain to better things
                     would break through all restraint, sacrifice all present advantage rather than
                     submit to. It was an opinion that would make the bad become worse, and tempt
                     the good to wrong. It was an opinion, in the poison of whose atmosphere men
                     without knowing why, grew prone to recklessness, irritation, and the worst of
                     daring. The habitual nurturing of such conceptions of his fellow men, in one
                     obliged to have them in great numbers about him, resulted in the necessity for
                     an immense amount of vigilance, more than would exhaust the energies of any one
                     man, even though in robust health, and the captain was constitutionally very
                     feeble. Had he understood his men better, he would have known that there were
                     lights as well as shadows in their difficult characters, and would have found a
                     better clue to their management, saving himself thereby a vast amount of
                     trouble. But he had an able coadjutor in his first mate; the two worked well
                     into each other's hands—they combined the brain to direct and muscle to
                     execute, and there was not much scruple in either as to the means by which they
                     retained authority.</p>
                  <p>Captain Eldrich had no idea, or he tried to have none, that he was unjust and
                     arbitrary in his proceedings—it was the kind of men, he supposed, whom he had
                     to deal with that forced him into extreme measures—with them lay the fault.</p>
                  <p>There are but few who can bear the weight of authority gracefully; many
                     disposed to be conscientious on first attaining the dignity of command, fail to
                     pass through the ordeal unscathed. Indeed Captain Eldrich prided himself on his
                     character for justice. He had for many years been reputed an able seaman; his
                     character stood high among his equals and business friends. He would not
                     defraud any of the smallest amount—not one penny. But he would misjudge a man;
                     rob him of his freedom of thought and action; insult his manhood, and deny him
                     the right to a life of honor and independence—because he had no sympathy with
                     anything deeper than a mere external right doing,—being in truth a gloomy
                     ascetic, whose feelings and actions were tinctured with the coldness and
                     sterility of his own nature.</p>
                  <p>The burning days were now constant and unremitting, only varied by a slight
                     touch of the sweeping tornado. It became burdensome to live. This fever-calm
                     and heat settled down upon and enclosed the vessel like molten metal. The
                     dreaded tropical storms almost grew to be desirable as a relief from the
                     fearful intensity and monotony of the fiery atmosphere.</p>
                  <p>But these storms, though passing near with their train of ominous black clouds,
                     enshrouded in the strange and vapory vail of white, with which in these
                     tropical regions the tempest covers its terrors, scowled in the distance, and
                     approached no nearer.</p>
                  <p>The squall, the ardently wished for blast brought no relief; so much condensed
                     heat did there seem in these shifting winds, that in the intermediate lull the
                     heaviness of the atmosphere appeared doubly intensified. It was only when night
                     closed, with perhaps an occasional heavy shower, accompanying the most terrific
                     thunder, that sleep, or rest was attainable.</p>
                  <p>But with all these drawbacks our young sailors managed to make some little
                     amusement for their spare hours; games and books, singing and conversation
                     alternated their evenings. They managed to drag in a little love too, and so
                     created an unceasing fund of interest. The young lady passenger in the early
                     part of the voyage kept herself quite a recluse, but when they came permanently
                     into the warm latitudes she was obliged with the rest to avail herself of any
                     opportunity for change, or a slight variation from the oppressive temperature
                     of the close cabin. So in the cool of the late afternoons, and sometimes in the
                     quiet of the moonlight evenings, the graceful figure was seen promenading that
                     portion of the deck appropriated to female passengers. During daylight the
                     young lady's face was invariably covered, on these occasions, with a thin gauze
                     vail, and her person enveloped in a long, dark mantle. It would scarcely be
                     supposed that here was material sufficient to raise a flame even in the most
                     ignitible bosom, yet two of our ardent young sailors managed to fall in love,
                     or imagine they did so, with the retiring and undemonstrative wearer of the
                     above modest apparel.</p>
                  <p>Young Weston and Tilton were the two rivals. The report went about that the
                     lady was both beautiful and agreeable. The young men of course worshipped at a
                     distance, but to one of Weston's impulsive temperament distance only increased
                     the measure of his devotion. The constant jesting allusions of his companions,
                     the jealousy, dread, and really ridiculous aspect of affairs, kept him in a
                     constant state of<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5590-00000031"/> nervous excitement.
                     Neither had ventured to speak, but Weston had vowed himself her slave for
                     life—her knight-errant, to guard and serve her forever. He could live always
                     thus—hover round her—never sully, her presence by a nearer approach. He knew
                     she was far above him; he would only dare to raise his thoughts to her, and
                     presume afar off to worship her perfections.</p>
                  <p>To Simpson's mischievous nature, Weston's earnestness, and Tilton's
                     thoughtless, dare-devil ways afforded great scope for hilarity. He was
                     constantly putting them against each other—magnifying the most insignificant
                     thing, and thus what would have been a matter of jest—at most an innocent
                     romance, to end when the voyage was over with a day's disappointment, was
                     swollen into something of serious import. The young men, usually so void of any
                     permanent feelings of ill will, began to imagine they must hate each other. All
                     kinds of misapprehension were constantly occurring to widen the breach.</p>
                  <p>About this time a little circumstance took place which elevated Tilton to the
                     highest pitch of felicity, and threw poor Weston into the very depth of
                     misery.</p>
                  <p>It happened that one morning early, as the young lady was taking her usual
                     promenade in peaceful unconsciousness of the wars among her worshippers, a
                     sudden gust swept by, and in an unguarded moment carried her light veil up in
                     the air, where floating and fluttering with great uncertainty for a time, it
                     finally rested at the extreme end of the long bowsprit. Tilton who happened to
                     be near, noticed the accident the moment it occurred; with the quickness of
                     thought he followed and rescued the frail treasure, and with bashful
                     awkwardness, and covered with unspeakable confusion, he handed it to the fair
                     owner.</p>
                  <p>Her agreeable smile and many thanks put him quite at his ease, however, and
                     then she had so many questions to ask as to where they were, and how soon they
                     might expect the voyage to end, that their conference lasted quite a little
                     time. This led to a passing notice when they met, a bow and a smile, and he was
                     such an honest looking young fellow, so frank and good natured, she had
                     ventured on one or two occasions to ask for a little information; "Had he ever
                     been in India? She was a stranger." "Yes, he had been." Then there were some
                     things he could tell her.</p>
                  <p>This little colloquy was magnified by the jealousy of poor Weston, till he was
                     completely dispirited. Here was quite a godsend for Simpson, and his
                     mischief-loving nature suggested innumerable ways of prolonging the discussion
                     by keeping Weston continually on the rack.</p>
                  <p>But it was not so much in regard to these two that Simpson was interested in
                     the love game thus being played—they were a pair of simpletons whom he could
                     wind round his finger—they might go on forever with their impossible fancies,
                     and not trouble him; but it was through them he hoped to hit Geoffrey.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was well aware that Simpson cherished a strong and growing dislike to
                     him. He felt it in many ways,—by insinuation, by sly thrusts, and cool,
                     insulting words; but it had never come in a square and open form, so that he
                     could ask explanation.</p>
                  <p>An open insult we can meet and return promptly, thrusting it from our minds
                     thereafter; but these ever-recurring taunts and inuendoes thrown out under the
                     semblance of friendship are far more difficult and dangerous things to manage—a
                     subtle poison which may infuse itself into, and wither a whole lifetime,
                     cunningly leaving it out of the sufferer's power to say in what spot he is
                     wounded, or name the deadly thing that has destroyed him.</p>
                  <p>It was scarcely to be wondered at that Geoffrey and Weston were, as I have
                     mentioned, more intimate together than with the others. In education, taste,
                     and the early circumstances of their lives they were more nearly on a level.
                     Without by any means holding themselves in the least aloof from their
                     messmates, they naturally, had a fellow-feeling somewhat distinct from the
                     frank friendship with which they regarded garded the rough men who constituted
                     the rest of the crew.</p>
                  <p>Simpson did not like this: it should not be. He was envious and jealous. These
                     gentlemen lubbers, as he sneeringly termed them aside to his companions, must
                     be brought to their bearings, we will have none of their nonsense. To Weston,
                     whom he regarded as a weak fool, he was indifferent, but Geoffrey came nearer
                     his measure, and he resolved to bring him down.</p>
                  <p>In the early part of their acquaintance he had met Geoffrey with such warmth,
                     and expressed so much willingness to serve him, that it seemed really churlish
                     to refuse his repeated offers, and they were accepted in the same apparently
                     frank spirit in which they were offered. Simpson taught him many things, and
                     repeatedly saved him from the serious consequences of his ignorance. For all
                     this Geoffrey was truly grateful, and felt as if he never could make a
                     sufficient return. But this did not satisfy the exacting nature of Simpson, and
                     strange as it may seem, the simple unconsciousness with which Geoffrey set
                     aside his government and asserted his own independence, was the original secret
                     of his enmity. Those who desire to rule never forgive the rebellious.</p>
                  <p>To reach and wound Geoffrey, he tormented and excited Weston, and fanned
                     incessantly the flame of his foolish devotion to the unknown young lady. For
                     Geoffrey having been Weston's good genius since he came on board, was pained to
                     find his efforts to strengthen and cheer the young man were rendered futile by
                     the constant excitement of petty jealousy and unmeaning passion, which Simpson
                     used every means to aggravate.</p>
                  <p>But they were approaching the end of the voyage. A few days would bring them to
                     land, where they would part, never probably to meet again, as Geoffrey had not
                     shipped for the return voyage.</p>
                  <p>But Simpson could not be done with them so easily. He brooded and planned, and
                     took the good-natured Tilton into his councils. Tilburn was always ready for a
                     frolic.</p>
                  <p>"Let us," said Simpson, "invite these gentlemen-lubbers to a last
                     merry-making—we will ply them well, and bring it about to have a quarrel. Then
                     we can manage these puny youngsters—you and I—and we'll give them a precious
                     trouncing before we part."</p>
                  <p>Agreed: and so the guests were invited.</p>
                  <p>In the evening, according to agreement, all contributed the last of their home
                     dainties, although to be sure the remainder of Geoffrey's supply furnished the
                     most substantial part of the feast. There was still some preserved fruit, and
                     even a portion of aunt Edith's great plum cake, and a remaining bottle of rare
                     old wine—her gift also; it was freely brought forth—and with checker and
                     cribbage-board they sat gaily down to the entertainment. This day Simpson had
                     been promoted second mate, and it was made the subject of hearty
                     congratulation. The men seemed indeed, all of them in merry mood, and as if
                     they might have forgotten old sores entirely. Tilton and Weston shook hands,
                     and indeed for the time had forgotten there was any trouble between them.</p>
                  <p>"What a couple of children you are," said Simpson, sneering.</p>
                  <p>"Let them alone," said Geoffrey, aside.</p>
                  <p>"Let them alone—what do you mean?" answered Simpson, aloud, "but you are so
                     wise you see things that no one else so wise you see things that no one else
                     sees."</p>
                  <p>"Well, never mind, here is a glass of the purest wine that ever passed your
                     lips."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I suppose," said Simpson with a shrug, "the like of us can hardly
                     appreciate such excellences," and he drained the glass. "What do you think of
                     that, Tilton, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"Splendid! its first rate," said Tilton, heartily, "it's like oil in the mouth,
                     it's so rich. Now another, to drink to your health. Geoffrey and Weston, and if
                     you ever need a friend call on Joe Tilton; he'll be on hand."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw!" said Simpson, sarcastically, "that'll do very well here on shipboard,
                     but on shore—<emph>then</emph> we'll see! By G-d, Tilton, they'd cut us out
                     without any trouble!"</p>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5590-00000032"/>
                  <p>"No, no," said both the young men, "we're not of that kind. A friend to us in
                     need is a friend always. There have been some kindnesses we shall always
                     remember with gratitude and wish to repay them."</p>
                  <p>"You're right," said Tilton; "I always believed you to be a couple of nice
                     fellows—no airs or nonsense—real gentlemen."</p>
                  <p>Indeed he forgot his agreement with Simpson to seek a quarrel, and his spirits
                     rose to the most jubilant pitch. He sang snatches of songs, perpetrated the
                     most ridiculous jokes, laughed at everything every one said, shook hands with
                     his friends again and again, in order fully to assure them of his good
                     feelings, and altogether acted the real single-hearted fellow that he was.</p>
                  <p>But Simpson, cool, and with all his wits about him, still kept to the one
                     purpose. Ah, had he known the full extent of its termination, even he would
                     have hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he replied, quietly, to Tilton's demonstrations, "I've heard all this
                     before—and Tilton you're a fool, an infernal fool—I've always said it. People
                     can make you believe anything. I know better than to mind all this
                     stuff,—gratitude and the like!"</p>
                  <p>"Now," said Geoffrey, interrupting him, "I see it plainly—I have long thought
                     it. There is something unpleasant on your mind, Simpson. Out with it, like a
                     man! You'll feel better! If I have done anything to offend you, I assure you it
                     was unintentional, and I freely ask your pardon."</p>
                  <p>"Ask my pardon! poh, I've had to do with the like of you before—these would be
                     gentlemen can be very humble to be sure!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was now somewhat angry, and almost disposed to resent this. "It's not
                     fair, Simpson," he said,"you have no right to say this."</p>
                  <p>"I've a right to say anything I please!"</p>
                  <p>"Not if it's an untruth."</p>
                  <p>"Who says I'm a liar?" cried Simpson hotly, and as he spoke aimed a fierce blow
                     at Geoffrey, which missed him however, but which he instantly returned with
                     such effect that Simpson was almost thrown from his seat.</p>
                  <p>Sulky Pete was by. He had heard it all in philosophic silence, and as they
                     sprang to their feet he cried out.</p>
                  <p>"We'll have fair play! There's bad blood between those two—let em fight it out,
                     they're a good match."</p>
                  <p>But Weston, fearing for Geoffrey, rushed between the combatants.</p>
                  <p>Tilton pulled him back, "I'll have none of this quarrelling among friends,"
                     said he, holding the struggling youth with his strong arms.</p>
                  <p>"Good!" cried Simpson, with a fiendish laugh, "I'll manage this one, you can
                     that! At him—the puny youngster! You can manage his lady-love and surely you
                     can him!"</p>
                  <p>Weston was now furious, striking blindly every way at the one that held him.
                     Geoffrey, though slight in figure, was agile and well knit, he readily baffled
                     his stronger antagonist; but Weston was a child in the powerful grasp of
                     Tilton's muscular arm. Frenzied with that cruel taunt, and fairly wild with the
                     confusion and excitement, he struggled and fought, till Tilburn lost temper,
                     and with one giant effort caught him up, and threw him nearly across the
                     forecastle. There was a cry of horror; all supposed he was killed, but he arose
                     with eyes glaring. Horrible! there was an open jacknife lying upon the table;
                     they had used it for cutting their cake. He seized it with such lightning speed
                     that Tilton, who had stopped to breathe, unprepared received its whole length
                     in his breast. The enraged man, wild with pain and passion had plunged it to
                     the handle in the heart of his supposed adversary.</p>
                  <p>That fearful <emph>thug,</emph> as the body came to the floor, threw a shiver
                     over all present. There was death in the sound. Antagonists and lookers-on all
                     stopped and stood transfixed. There lay Tilton, honest, frank Tilton, with face
                     upturned and features set yet calm—life must have fled in an instant. There
                     stood his wretched murderer. What had he done? was he in a dream? He groaned in
                     agony—"Oh, speak, Tilton! I have not killed you! Good God, it cannot be!" But a
                     moment since they were friends; the echoes of that good-humored-laugh had
                     scarcely yet died away; madly Weston wrung his hands, he clutched them in his
                     hair—that soft, beautiful hair. "Oh Geoffrey, kill me! kill me!" he cried. "Oh,
                     if I could but hate him, and feel glad that I had wreaked my vengeance on him!
                     but I love him—oh, I do sincerely pity him! <emph>can</emph> he be dead? What a
                     fearful cry that was! I pierced his heart, his kind, warm heart—it is all, all
                     over."</p>
                  <p>The remorse of the young man was terribly touching; even some of the hardiest
                     could not keep back their tears, and Simpson, beaten, bruised, discouraged, for
                     the first time saw his conduct in its true light.</p>
                  <p>Cruelly mischievous, envious and malignant, he had brought this thing about. No
                     one should ever know it, but his own conscience like a curse would be forever
                     whispering it. And what had he accomplished? The two, of all others, whom he
                     had no grudge against were sacrificed, while the one whom he hated was his
                     conqueror.</p>
                  <p>The news that a man was murdered had run like wildfire through the ship. The
                     mate, followed by a crowd of excited men rushed in upon the awe-stricken
                     group.</p>
                  <p>"You infernal rascals!" were his first words. "Where's the murderer?" And
                     without any mercy they fell upon the poor agonized creature, who, sore and
                     bruised enough already, made no resistance; till Surly Pete, indignant at their
                     cruelty, cried,</p>
                  <p>"Easy boys! don't hurt the poor devil."</p>
                  <p>Another voice now spoke in command. Each one looked up in amazement. It was
                     that of Captain Eldrich. "What have you to say here, you mutinous dog?" he
                     said, looking at Pete. "Another word, and you shall be served the same. Let the
                     offenders step out who have been engaged in this fight," he called
                     authoritatively. Simpson and Geoffrey were indicated.</p>
                  <p>"Put that greenhand in irons, too," was the order.</p>
                  <p>Pete again interposed; no one else dared speak. "It's not fair, sir!"</p>
                  <p>"Silence! another word, and you shall have fifty lashes. Mate, send that man on
                     deck."</p>
                  <p>Weston and Geoffrey were shut up separately in <choice>

                  <p>"SURELY PETE," as he was almost universally named, was one of those who go
                     through life, as through the battle ground, fighting and struggling for every
                     step they gain.</p>
                  <p>The constitution of his mind, strong in its every bias, disposed him to
                     uncompromising ideas of justice and right. He had started in life with high
                     determination to pursue an unwavering course; but unfortunately his temper was
                     violent, and he lacked the education that would have rendered useful the
                     principles of conduct he adopted, and the society which would have obliged him
                     to restrain his uncouth impetuosity. These opinions which he held so
                     pertinaciously, and put forth so brusquely, good as they might be, gained him
                     more enemies than friends. He was a strong, muscular fellow, and in the heat of
                     his temper when arguments failed to silence opposition, would bring down the
                     hammer of bone and muscle to clinch the matter. Thus he was avoided, and
                     reputed fierce and hateful in disposition, when really by nature he was soft
                     and tender, craving sympathy, and having the capacity to love with undying
                     devotion, and to serve the friend or the cause he espoused with undying
                     heroism.</p>
                  <p>But few could discern these good qualities under this irritable
                     self-consciousness, demanding so much, bristling all over with ready
                     antagonism; all deserted him, and in his disappointment, feeling that he was
                     misunderstood, and missing the friendliness and social cheer so much needed by
                     men of this disposition, he became silent and morose, and in the rough life he
                     led only to be roused to quarrelling or violence.</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5590-00000033"/>
                  <p>For one who has to buffet the trials of life so low down in-the scale of
                     existence, it might seem almost a mistake by which he was endowed with these
                     troublesome personalities and strongly marked features of mind.</p>
                  <p>Had this man's birth placed him in <choice>
                        <sic>emiinent</sic>
                        <corr>eminent</corr>
                     </choice> station, where wealth and education and all the influence they bring,
                     would have surrounded him, this irascibility, now so offensive, would
                     undoubtedly have been deemed high spirit, and the self-consciousness that
                     brooked no contradiction would have been the innate dignity of a mind formed
                     for pre-eminence. Unforgiving, inflexible, never doubting or changing, for-ever
                     keeping in the one thought and course, he would have made the great partisan
                     leader, gaining distinction by the powerful determination of his unyielding
                     will.</p>
                  <p>But our poor Pete was of little account—there was no one to speculate on or
                     care for his peculiarities. He was only an ugly, cross, brooding old fellow.
                     And long he did brood over what seemed to him the injustice of confining
                     Geoffrey below, and putting him in irons. Geoffrey was the only one who had
                     probed beneath the hard surface of this man's nature, and made him feel that
                     there was still a soft, warm place in his heart.</p>
                  <p>"It's a damned shame!" he would mutter, "and that young devil free, the cause
                     of all this trouble! I've seen it all for the last two months—I knew it would
                     come to this. But what can I do? If I speak it always makes matters worse."</p>
                  <p>He had heard the quarrel, and knew all about its commencement.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," he repeated, "that devil of a Simpson is at the bottom of it all, and
                     yet he goes free. There's no right nor justice in it!"</p>
                  <p>Yet Simpson withal was not free. He had the mortification of defeat, many
                     bruises, and a pretty sore conscience to bear. But this did not satisfy Pete;
                     nothing would have satisfied him so well as to have laid his own heavy fist on
                     the villain, and transferred those irons from Geoffrey's limbs to his.</p>
                  <p>The day following that on which this fearful tragedy had occurred, was Sunday,
                     and a day of glorious beauty it was. The air was beautifully cool, and the sun
                     rose calm and clear, as though the earth it smiled upon had never been profaned
                     by sight or sound of human passion or woe.</p>
                  <p>The presence of death spread a chastened quiet over the ship. Men spoke low:
                     the noisiest and cheeriest among them were silent now. Calamity brings us all
                     into nearer relationship. Even the young lady passenger and the terror-stricken
                     woman in the second cabin, came out to inquire concerning the death of this
                     "common seaman." The body lay covered under the shadow of the awning on deck.
                     They uncovered the face; it was pleasant, almost smiling; not a feature was
                     distorted. The pitying women wept.</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said the elder one, "if he has a mother, God pity her!"</p>
                  <p>"And how obliging and pleasant he was," the lady murmured softly, "I did not
                     fear to ask him any favor—so kind, so considerate he was! Let us pray that good
                     angels may gather round the released spirit, and bear it to the better
                     land!"</p>
                  <p>Kindly and fitting words; the last, as it seemed that were to be spoken over
                     the dead.</p>
                  <p>For a shadow was gathering over the ship, dispelling in its sinister gloom all
                     better or brighter thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The captain was animated to renewed activity by this event. He arose early the
                     next day, and gave directions personally. He and the mate were afterward in
                     long and close consultation, and finally Simpson was called. There was an
                     immense amount of conjecture among the crew in regard to this. Some thought he
                     was going to get his deserts, but others shook their heads; "Never mind old
                     Simpson," said they, "he'll come out all right!"</p>
                  <p>Simpson left the conference giving no clue by his countenance to what had
                     occurred; he went about his business with his usual alacrity. But old Jacob
                     shrewdly remarked to one standing near him,</p>
                  <p>"It comes handy to that young chap to order us round. I think it'll do him good
                     to give us a kick and a cuff occasionally, in his sly way. Confound him! he'll
                     soon take the wind out of his master's sails."</p>
                  <p>During the early part of the day prayers and the morning service had been read
                     by the captain himself.</p>
                  <p>At early twilight that evening the body of the young man was to be lowered into
                     the deep; but before performing this solemn ceremony, the captain gave due
                     notice that he would personally take the opportunity of saying a few words of
                     serious warning to all, and expected all to be present.</p>
                  <p>In consultation it had been decided, and Simpson had eagerly urged the
                     decision, that neither Geoffrey nor Weston should be brought on deck during
                     that time. They looked so bad, and Weston was really ill—it might bring about a
                     dangerous reaction in their favor. The culprits were such favorites, and the
                     whole ship's crew such a set of mutinous dogs, it would not do to trust
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Lingeringly the sun lowered in the west that quiet, lovely afternoon, and
                     dipped its radiance beneath the darkening horizon. Faint streaks of crimson
                     still flushed the fading clouds as the moon arose in tranquil majesty, not a
                     vapor to shadow its pure serenity. The air from the distant land was felt, cool
                     and invigorating.</p>
                  <p>Bengal, and its capital, Calcutta, enjoys during the early fall months a most
                     delightful atmosphere. We, in the northern latitudes, would perhaps call it
                     warm—very warm—the thermometer ranging from 80° to 85°; but to the weary
                     voyager, so long exposed to the direct rays of a tropical sun, while traversing
                     the burning Indian Ocean, the air appears deliciously changed and cool.</p>
                  <p>It was a sad and impressive scene, when in the still beauty of this evening
                     twilight the ship's crew gathered with uncovered heads around that silent bier.
                     The body of Tilton lay there wrapped in its winding sheet, waiting to be
                     launched into the quiet waters at the word of command.</p>
                  <p>The captain with his mates stood on a small platform,—he had just raised his
                     voice to begin the reading, when casting his eyes with a searching scrutiny
                     among the men he perceived that all were there but that ever <choice>
                        <sic>refactory</sic>
                        <corr>refractory</corr>
                     </choice> Pete. He at once commanded that Pete should be called. One of the men
                     went to summon him, but soon returned with the answer that he was not
                     coming.</p>
                  <p>"But he shall come!" said the captain, with raised voice, forgetting for a
                     moment the gravity of the occasion.</p>
                  <p>The messenger had prudently withheld much that Pete did say. That exasperated
                     worthy had remarked that he did not want to hear any of that maudlin
                     stuff!—Justice first! Let him release Geoffrey, and put the other young fellow
                     in quarters where a human being could live,—<emph>that</emph> would speak
                     louder to men's consciences than anything he could say.</p>
                  <p>But the captain still persevered in insisting that Pete should come. Another
                     man was sent with the same command reiterated—no excuse would be taken.</p>
                  <p>"Then you may say once for all that I will <emph>not</emph> come!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! is that so!" cried the captain,—"mates take a rope and bring that man here
                     dead or alive."</p>
                  <p>Pete saw them coming. In an instant he knew they were going to take him by
                     force. He sprang for the cook's galley, and seizing an immense iron poker, he
                     came out flourishing it around his head, calling out to them that the first man
                     who came near should feel the weight of that upon his skull.</p>
                  <p>Pete was not a man to be trifled with. His great size, powerful muscular
                     development, and known ferocity, had often before made them hesitate when
                     disposed for extreme measures; the two men retreated.</p>
                  <p>The captain was now furious at being thus defied and browbeaten in his own
                     ship. "Bring the man to me!" he repeated hoarsely.</p>
                  <p>But none dare move. The dark figure in all its breadth and strength stood
                     boldly out in the moonlight, making its circle of fierce defiance.</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5590-00000034"/>
                  <p>Which was the most excited Pete or the captain could scarcely be known. The
                     latter, who had moved slowly, talked low, and avoided all effort for so long a
                     time, was now as quick, agile and determined as any. A stream of almost
                     maniacal light shone from his eyes; throwing off his coat and all his outside
                     wrappings, he called for ropes. Going into his cabin he returned with a brace
                     of pistols in each hand, while the mate with a slipnoose coiled around his arm
                     followed close behind.</p>
                  <p>There was a cry of horror when they appeared; all thought of Pete.</p>
                  <p>"Don't kill our comrade!" shouted many voices.</p>
                  <p>"No, by heaven!" answered the captain. "Killing would be too good for him. He
                     will only smell a little gunpowder."</p>
                  <p>Pete by this time had braced himself against the side of the vessel. The
                     captain stepped deliberately forward, and within a few feet of the seaman fired
                     a charge of powder, then suddenly springing nearer in the midst of the flash
                     and smoke, he discharged the other pistol directly in the face of the daring
                     rebel against his authority. Burned, blinded, and for the moment frantic, Pete
                     reeled and let fall his weapon, when the mate rushed upon him, and bound him
                     securely with a rope.</p>
                  <p>"Now," said the captain, "tie him to the mainmast,—come Simpson, help, he must
                     have fifty lashes before we're done."</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate man, writhing with the torture of his burning flesh wounds, was
                     dragged to the center of the vessel, and there made fast.</p>
                  <p>"Now who'll give the first lash?" cried his merciless persecutor; "Ah, you hang
                     back, you mutinous villains! Give me the rope!" And with the vigorous stroke of
                     uncontrollable rage, he laid on the lash—one—two—three—till his arm fell
                     powerless at his side, and fairly exhausted and helpless he was carried away,
                     and laid almost fainting upon his bed.</p>
                  <p>The wretched Pete was lowered from his place of punishment, and by Simpson and
                     the mate fastened securely to the deck. All were forbidden to go near him,
                     under penalty of the lash. Poor Tilton was now without much ceremony hastily
                     consigned to the deep. This wail of human discord was, alas, the young sailor's
                     only requiem.</p>
                  <p>The moon still shone serene and grand, and flooded with its solemn light the
                     now silent and deserted deck. The men hid themselves in dark corners, and
                     gathered together in knots, to whisper about and talk over the strange and
                     terrible state of affairs. They were weary and satiated with horrors. With
                     shuddering sympathy they glanced fearfully over to the suffering man bound
                     helpless in their very sight. They longed to do something for him—give him a
                     drink, or rub that scorched skin with cooling salve. But they were watched—so
                     was he—and would be all night; two men with loaded pistols keeping guard over
                     the captive.</p>
                  <p>But could their most vivid imaginings approach the mental and physical agony
                     that tortured the proud soul of Sulky Pete? There he lay bound like a dog, his
                     scorched eyeballs burning with intensest pain, every nerve throbbing wildly
                     with heart-sickening agony.</p>
                  <p>Oh, these are the times when of suffering, of individual oppression, and cruel
                     malignity, dark deeds of vengeance are born! Quickly matured, precociously
                     ripened, revenge becomes the mastering passion. It is the one thought, the one
                     desire to glut over. The mind perverted, seems to concentrate every thought to
                     one fearful focus. Murder and violence run riot, sporting themselves in
                     alluring forms through the diseased imagination. That which would have been
                     horror becomes delight—the one mania idea overpowering, urging on the tortured
                     to become the torturer.</p>
                  <p>What a strange mystery was this man, with all these principles of good and
                     evil, so strongly marked, so strangely blended. He smiled that fearful,
                     demoniacal smile, that comes across the face as a warning spasm, to tell us of
                     the death of love. Yes, he smiled the bitter smile of hate, when he made the
                     final resolve. And yet there had been a struggle in his breast, before he could
                     take the fatal plunge into that infinite abyss of deepest sin. He pondered over
                     the consequences if he washed his hands in this man's blood. He knew that if he
                     perpetrated this awful deed, for him there was no retreat; he sacrificed
                     himself with his victim. And to what avail? Might he not still enjoy a little
                     of life, and leave that cold unfeeling tyrant to the accusings of conscience?
                     Why should he throw himself away? Why? Brooding over this idea—as a sort of
                     self-sacrifice—the more it took possession of him and the more determined he
                     became. It seemed a noble resolution; not so much for himself, as to rid the
                     world of so much injustice.</p>
                  <p>This man reasoned, as he fancied, calmly, but like all reason when passion is
                     the basis, one strong desire governed completely, and controlled absolutely
                     what appeared to be the action of the intellect. Only blood would satisfy the
                     burning thirst that consumed him, only blood, and blood it must be.</p>
                  <p>Alas! there was no pitying sympathy, or kindly word to stay the gathering
                     tumult of that raging soul. Perhaps—so nearly are soul and body allied—had
                     there been a ministering hand to pour soothing oil upon the scathed and mangled
                     flesh, or administer the cooling drink to moisten the cravings of the parched
                     throat—perhaps in that moment of blessed relief some chord of gratitude might
                     have been touched, which had roused with its soft music the better nature. But
                     he was alone—save the companionship of his watcher, now fast asleep, and that
                     ever present agony of torture urging him on to retaliation.</p>
                  <p>The fierceness of his bodily and mental suffering found no outlet in
                     expression; he lay there motionless—he did not groan nor cry:—not a gesture
                     betrayed the fiery passion that raged within, or the physical anguish almost
                     beyond endurance.</p>
                  <p>It was now past midnight. A perfect silence rested everywhere only broken by
                     the ripple at the ship's bow, as she crept softly through the calm waters. Not
                     a cloud was in the sky; a gentle breeze came from the nearing shore laden with
                     the sweets of many flowers. All nature was in its loveliest repose. The moon,
                     now almost overhead, poured down her rays clear and light seemingly as day.
                     Still, save that one poor wretch, all slept on the quiet ship. With him every
                     nerve, every sense was a thousand times awake. With them the undue excitement
                     of the last two nights had apparently resulted in the exhaustion of mind and
                     body. The guard slept, charged on his peril to be vigilant;—the watch on the
                     deck nodded drowsily at his post;—the man at the wheel, had lashed it to a
                     steady course, and like the rest sank down to snatch a few minutes brief
                     repose.</p>
                  <p>A purpose, strong and dark as death was brooding in the mind of Sulky Pete. In
                     the eager working of his scheming brain his agony was almost forgotten.
                     Silently working and twisting, he strained at the tight cords that bound him,
                     till, oh, inexpressible joy! although the torn flesh writhed with the effort,
                     his hand moved in the encircling rope.</p>
                  <p>He lay still: he listened: the heavy breathing around him betokened surely that
                     he was unseen. Again he moved, carefully, persistently—his hand was free. He
                     searched for his knife, that in the confusion of his captivity had by a strange
                     fatality been left still in his pocket. None had thought to take from him this
                     dangerous weapon. Touching the spring it opened like the ready response of a
                     waiting demon, answering his murderous thoughts. One after another every cord
                     that bound him was cut. He raised himself all stiff and maimed, and looked
                     cautiously about. He then rose to his feet;—no one stirred; he crept stealthily
                     along in the shadow of the deck-cabin walls, and reached at length the
                     captain's private room, it was a large, airy room with many windows on its
                     opposite sides, through which a flood of radiant moonlight poured, as gently
                     pushing open the unlocked door the avenger stood within. He had not expected
                     such easy access. Bolts and bars and the ever-ready weapon in the watchful
                     hand, these he was prepared to overcome. But fate and carelessness thrust all
                     into his hands.</p>
                  <p>Suspended by silken cords from the ceiling<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000035"/> ing a hammock hung shrouded by light gauzy
                     drapery. In the hammock, soundly sleeping, lay the unconscious victim. The
                     approaching intruder tore aside the frail curtain surrounding the sleeper.
                     Helpless, quiet and calm he lay, but his helplessness did not appeal to the
                     mercy of the vengeful heart, whose better qualities he never recognised in his
                     waking moments. It was now too late.</p>
                  <p>"No," muttered Pete; "I have more than one score to settle!" he hissed between
                     his closed teeth, clasping as in a vice with one hand the arms thrown over the
                     sleeper's head, while with the other he held suspended the glittering knife
                     ready to plunge it into the palpitating heart.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate man struggled as if aroused from a terrible nightmare. But he
                     could not move; his feeble energy was as nothing in the grasp that held him.
                     His voice was paralyzed, but he knew and felt what was coming.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my God!" he cried at last, "this is a fearful dream!" Again he tried to
                     shout, but a voice distinct and clear, a voice that he knew, whispered with
                     terrible distinctness, "Silence!—Not a moment shall you live if a sound is
                     heard."</p>
                  <p>In a moment the captain realized it all;—every sense was wide awake. His brain
                     was in a flame—his inveterate enemy, the man he had taunted and fired upon,
                     whom he had bruised and abused—the man so infinitely below him that he had
                     spurned him with his heel, and flung the wretch as unimportant and impotent
                     aside,—this man was close upon him looking with glaring hatred into his eyes.
                     The power was <emph>his</emph> now, the vengeance his.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, have mercy!" cried the captain, faintly, "all I have is yours—only spare
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>"Spare you!" whispered Pete, "all you have will not bring back—" And he placed
                     his mouth close to his victim's ear,—the muttered words were only heard by him.
                     "No! No! And I still warned you. There was something more needed to bring me to
                     this—and it came with the lash."</p>
                  <p>A smothered cry woke the stillness of the night. It roused the two women in the
                     next cabin; they trembled and shuddered, and covered themselves close as the
                     ominous sound penetrated with unearthly meaning the chambers of their dreams.
                     It was followed by a deadly silence. Could this be a dream? Still shuddering
                     and trembling they prayed for the morning.</p>
                  <p>The murderer crept back, the bloody knife still clasped in his hand, and lay
                     down in the same place where he had been bound.</p>
                  <p>When morning revealed the atrocious deed, those who came fearful and cautious
                     to secure the desperate man, found him, strange to say, quietly asleep. When
                     roused he made no resistance, "It's all right," he said to his comrades when
                     they hesitated a little, "All right! I'm ready to pay the penalty of what I've
                     done."</p>

                  <head type="sub">SHORES OF INDIA.—THE PRISONERS.</head>
                  <p>ON the second morning after this revolting catastrophe, just as the dawn began
                     to break, they entered, from the extensive bay, the beautiful Hooghly. This
                     river has been graphically described by one who knew it well. "It is
                     astonishing," remarks this writer, "that so little has been said or written
                     regarding the extraordinary beauty of the Hooghly. The Ganges to which so many
                     sacred remembrances are attached, from its immense expanse, and the deep
                     stillness of a current that flows over a soft, yielding soil, realizes the idea
                     of grandeur and sublimity; but the Hooghly charms to rapture by the picturesque
                     loveliness of its surroundings. The moisture of the climate in this particular
                     part of the country, with the peculiar nature of the soil, concur in preserving
                     an eternal verdure. Even in the hottest weather, when the sun perhaps for weeks
                     together pours down so fierce a flood of light, that it would seem as if its
                     scorching beams might dry up every blade of grass, the whole earth is covered
                     with a rich carpet, and the eye revels upon scenery of the most interesting
                     character.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can exceed the beauty of the foliage which waves over this favored
                     land. The high grounds on many parts of the river, which in a bend or turn
                     usually assume the character of a promontory, are frequently approached by a
                     stair, which winds down the declivity, and is partially revealed at every
                     opening. These stairs are often, if belonging to a Hindoo temple, strewed from
                     the top to the bottom with fresh flowers of the most beautiful kinds. Long
                     garlands of the Indian jasmine, with its delicious pearl white petals, and
                     blossoms of scarlet and yellow odorous with the richest perfume, are gracefully
                     distributed on the descending rails. All this pomp of beauty continues for many
                     miles as we ascend the river,—while on its glittering waters float the
                     frigate-like pinnace, the gaily painted budgerow, and the graceful bahlio, more
                     brilliant in its decoration than the Venetian gondola."</p>
                  <p>It may be supposed that our tired voyagers fully appreciated this scene of
                     beauty so suddenly unfolded to them after their weary weeks and months of sea
                     life—the eye resting on nought but burning skies and steaming waters.</p>
                  <p>How happy and joyous all would have been in the prospect before them, but for
                     the circumstances in which they were all placed. The noble ship, burdened with
                     its freight of death and human suffering moved slowly onward. It passed the
                     splendid suburban villas, the spacious gardens where fruit and ornamental trees
                     of the most magnificent description surrounded the dwellings, and filled the
                     grounds even to the water's edge. Slowly, as if reluctant to jar the harmonious
                     scene with its weight of wo, the ship sailed on, past the feathery palm, the
                     sygwam, the fruiting jamrool with its hanging clusters of deep green leaves,
                     and all the wealth and splendor of tropical vegetation.</p>
                  <p>Many persons were on the shore—or from the shaded house viewing the ship with
                     their telescopes, seemed to cheer her on. It was always a glad sight to them to
                     witness these arrivals, perhaps from their old homes; and this vessel was well
                     known to them, it had often been in these waters before. All but the
                     unfortunate prisoners were on the deck, some admiring and some anxious.
                     Simpson, and even the mate were among the latter. Neither felt pleasant in the
                     anticipation of the examination and scrutiny they knew must take place on their
                     arrival.</p>
                  <p>Still, whoever might wish for delay, or dread the nearing shore, the vessel
                     kept steadily on in the light morning breeze, the green shore on either side,
                     so near that it seemed as if they were gliding through some verdant meadow,
                     till a sudden bend of the river brought them within a few yards of the splendid
                     city of Calcutta, the metropolis of British India, with its domes and spires,
                     and elegant public and private buildings, which faced with white stucco,
                     glittered and dazzled in the morning sunbeams, pleasantly contrasting with the
                     rich green of the foliage so closely surrounding them.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the ship weighed anchor a government boat came along side, when a
                     message was at once despatched on shore to inform the authorities and the
                     resident owner and consignee of the state of matters on board.</p>
                  <p>The boat returning with scarcely a moment's delay brought the owner
                     instantly.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman, Mr. Cranburn, had one of those fine, benevolent faces, which,
                     as we look upon them, inspire us to rest and peace, and a feeling of reliance
                     on their strength and goodness. His first appearance gave the impression of
                     quite advanced age. The snow-white hair, the rather trembling pressure of the
                     tall form as he leaned on a dark ebony cane, as though needing its assistance
                     to hold him erect, conveyed the idea of physical weakness—of being worn out—but
                     the clear, bright eye, the broad brow, the strong white teeth and firm mouth
                     still betokened vigor and vitality, suggesting to closer inspection that
                     climate, or other outward causes might have led to this appearance of premature
                     decay.</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5590-00000036"/>
                  <p>"Mr. Mate," he said, after listening to a detail of the different
                     circumstances, and viewing the body his old friend the captain, which had been
                     preserved in spirits, as they were so near shore at the time of the murder,
                     "these are painful matters. Most sad it is to contemplate so much of human
                     wickedness. Two violent deaths in as many days! "What could have brought about
                     such a dreadful state of affairs?"</p>
                  <p>"The fact is," answered the mate, "Our crew has been all through a regular set
                     of cut-throats.</p>
                  <p>"Bless me! And my poor friend has been sacrificed to wanton cruelty. Where did
                     you ship these men?"</p>
                  <p>"In New York."</p>
                  <p>"And two of them, I think you say, were greenhands, never at sea before. New
                     York is my native place. I would like to see those young men—I will go with you
                     and speak with them."</p>
                  <p>This was something the mate had not calculated on when he put those two men
                     each in a suffocating hole below, with hardly a breath of air to breathe, and
                     so little room that they were obliged to keep always in the same position. He
                     could not avoid a little hesitation, and confusion of manner, as he said,</p>
                  <p>"They are desperate fellows—we had to iron them heavily. I would not advise
                     you, sir, to have anything to say to them till the authorities carry them on
                     shore."</p>
                  <p>Whether the manner of the make excited his suspicion, or whether it was a mere
                     determination when he made up his mind to do a thing, that he would do it—the
                     old gentleman still persisted in desiring to see these men.</p>
                  <p>The mate was puzzled. He dared not offend the ship's owner by flatly refusing
                     to produce the prisoners. Yet what should he do? After long and patient years,
                     fate had placed almost within his grasp the position which it was his only
                     ambition to attain. He expected to be commander of that ship. Only this old
                     gentleman's sanction was needed to effect the ratification. Must he lose it by
                     this untoward affair? Many years he had been the willing slave, the drudge,
                     ready to do the dirty work, of a cold-hearted and tyrannical man—he had worked,
                     he had striven, he had debased his soul for this. Even now he had on his person
                     carefully secured the written document with the promise of the deceased, given
                     long before his death, that, in case of that event, his chief mate, so
                     well-deserving, should succeed him.</p>
                  <p>But here was the dilemma. His instincts told him that the appearance of these
                     men, whether they were brought on deck, or visited in their airless hole below,
                     would shock the old gentleman's sense of <choice>
                        <sic>humaniity</sic>
                        <corr>humanity</corr>
                     </choice>, and be most certainly fatal to his own interests.</p>
                  <p>All this passed through his mind with lightning speed as he paused, and then
                     the insolent nature of the ruffian came up to help him. What did he care for
                     that old fellow? Was he not master of the ship—and had been so ever since its
                     commander died? Yes, he was so, and would be so until regularly deposed. No one
                     should order him. If he chose he could order that old man off the ship.</p>
                  <p>But his craven soul shrank from contest with a superior. He could kick, swear
                     at, and abuse by the wholesale those over whom he ruled,—but that stately
                     figure standing there alone, so calm, yet so decided,—he quailed before it. For
                     the first time in his life, this man of nerve actually felt afraid,</p>
                  <p>Confound it! he was mad with himself—mad with every one. Why did not some one
                     come to help him—where was that infernal Simpson?</p>
                  <p>He called him. Simpson was not far off. He had heard all that was going on, and
                     his own fears had been working on his conscience. He knew it would be his place
                     to bring up these men, and he dreaded above all things to meet the eye of
                     Geoffrey. Every plan he had laid, every inward chuckle he had indulged at the
                     torture and torment he had inflicted came up now in aggravated distinctness.
                     These mischievous desires and intentions were only written on his own heart,
                     yet it seemed to him as if they were reflected upon every one's face, and that
                     the very air held them in solution, ready for revealment. All this he could
                     have borne within his daring soul, but there was in his secret heart, born of
                     this sense of wrong-doing, a strange and unaccountable feeling almost like
                     pity. He had been battling with it—it did not belong to him—such feelings he
                     had been accustomed to set aside as weak and childish. Still it kept growing.
                     He dreaded to see these young men, he knew they must be sick and suffering.
                     Shut up in that impure air, with scant and unwholesome food, if they were alive
                     it was all he expected.</p>
                  <p>"Simpson bring up those men," was repeated, this time in a rather conciliatory
                     tone. This gentler command seemed to suggest some renovating measures before
                     they were brought to the light.</p>
                  <p>In the few minutes that were allowed he had done all that he could. The irons
                     were knocked off, and cold water dashed in their faces to restore them. Poor
                     fellows! No one need have dreaded the glance of their feeble eyes,—weak and
                     staggering, they had hardly strength to lift their lids, and seemed utterly
                     indifferent as to what was done to them. Although their irons were knocked off
                     they could not rise; their limbs were stiff and paralyzed. Weston was carried
                     on deck, but Geoffrey, naturally more vigorous and enduring, was able with
                     assistance to walk.</p>
                  <p>What a sight they presented to that man of feeling, so little used to
                     spectacles of hardship in any form. He actually reeled and grasped the cabin
                     railing to keep himself from falling, as these two figures were presented
                     before him, emaciated, ghastly, and covered with vermin and filth.</p>
                  <p>"It was by our late captain's command," said the mate, apologetically, white
                     with anger and mortification.</p>
                  <p>"Don't speak to me again!" said Mr. Cranburn, now recovered from his shock,
                     "don't speak to me again, or I shall be tempted to knock you down! This matter
                     shall be thoroughly investigated, but I will have nothing more to say to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>Humiliated and silenced the mate skulked away.</p>
                  <p>When the rush of pure air met these two poor creatures, it was more than they
                     could bear. The light so long denied them flashed painfully on their enfeebled
                     sight, and Weston fainted as the men laid him on the deck, while Geoffrey
                     staggered and fell forward as though he were completely dead.</p>
                  <p>"My God! what is to be done?" said Mr. Cranburn, walking about in perfect
                     helplessness, "What <emph>can</emph> be done?"</p>
                  <p>But there were those near whose womanly instincts told them at once what to do.
                     These women, terror-stricken as they had been, now came forward without
                     hesitation, and he looked on with admiration and seeming wonder as they bathed
                     the pale faces and rubbed the listless limbs, bringing them to consciousness in
                     such a loving, gentle way, their very presence seemed to impart healing.</p>
                  <p>"You are surely angels!" said the kind old man, relieved of his anxiety, "it is
                     in times like these that you assert your preeminence."</p>
                  <p>An expression of joy and surprise irradiated Weston's face, as he opened his
                     eyes and saw who was bending so tenderly over him. His divinity! she who was so
                     immeasurably above him that it seemed almost contamination to have her dwell
                     even in his thoughts. Oh, might he die in this delusion—in this sweet delirium
                     of enchantment, with that soft hand, that sweet voice bidding him still
                     rest!</p>
                  <p>But the officers of justice had now arrived, and all was bustle and confusion
                     in transferring the prisoners on shore.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn followed. He had influence enough to secure them an airy apartment
                     in the jail to which they were consigned, with consent that they should remain
                     together, as they entreated, at least until after the examination.</p>
                  <p>At parting he shook them cordially by the hand, and told them to be of good
                     cheer. Even from poor Pete, when he saw his blackened and scarred visage, and
                     heard his story, he could not turn with dislike.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE TRIAL.—A NEW FRIEND.</head>
                  <p>COMMON humanity demanded that the physical needs of the prisoners should be at
                     once attended to.</p>
                  <p>Pete was severely burned; his eyes were inflamed—perhaps fatally injured; he
                     was sick and very feverish, his system fearfully excited, and altogether in
                     immediate need of medical aid.</p>
                  <p>Weston also was really very ill. Geoffrey had suffered less than his companion;
                     being naturally of a strong constitution, which had never been undermined by
                     early excesses, he could endure much hardship. Beside, the agony of Weston's
                     state of mind was such that it appeared as if that alone had power to destroy
                     him.</p>
                  <p>That handsome face, wild and haggard, bore in every line the ghastly record of
                     inward torment. He could not forgive himself, or be for a moment reconciled to
                     the iniquitous deed he had committed. He mourned for Tilton with the most
                     continuous sorrow. His remorse was accompanied with a sense of deepest pity, as
                     though he agonized in sympathy with the departed in an immeasurable grief that
                     he should have been snatched from the earth.</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow!" he would groan, "this life was to you so sweet—it filled up your
                     desires. Strong, hopeful, good, it was one long, cheerful anticipation. Can
                        you—<emph>can</emph> you forgive? Ah, no—no, not yet—not yet!"</p>
                  <p>Thus he sighed and sobbed, and seemed wearing his life away. Geoffrey had much
                     influence over him, and sitting by his bed in the large pleasant room so
                     mercifully appropriated to them, he tried to wean his companion's mind from
                     this constant self-condemnation. He recapitulated all the circumstances of that
                     fearful night.</p>
                  <p>"If," said he, "the departed soul is really, as you feel, in sympathy with your
                     thoughts, he knows that it was not from hatred or ill will, or any desire to do
                     him a wrong that you were led into this violence. You never meant him
                     harm."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, he must know," answered Weston quickly, "that I could never wantonly
                     injure him, the kind, good-hearted fellow! He knows that some mad folly or
                     insane passion possessed me. It seems in looking back as though I had lost part
                     of my life,—as though I had been whirled through some fearful blank, and then
                     my eyes were opened in a sudden rush of light to the awful deed I had done."
                     And again the despairing youth covered his face, and groaned in anguish of
                     soul.</p>
                  <p>But with Pete, the fierce, defiant, energetic man, another sort of contest was
                     going on. He had no compunctions for the deed he had committed, nor pity for
                     the victim who had so summarily, met a terrible doom by his hand. To him it was
                     only an act of swift justice of which he had been the instrument.</p>
                  <p>"I warned him," he would often mutter, "I warned him of his peril—he deserved
                     all he got. I would do it again! By heaven and earth I would!"</p>
                  <p>It was scarcely to be imagined, yet it was true, that this coarse-featured,
                     heavy-visaged man, lying helpless on his hard couch, more than ever repulsive
                     to look upon, with his burns and scars and blood-shot eyes, was writhing still
                     under the insult to his personal dignity, and the recollections of outraged
                     pride; deeming the crime he had committed a just punishment to one who had
                     inflicted punishment on him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn visited the prison daily, and spent many hours with the prisoners.
                     Through his representations (being one of the most influential men in the city)
                     the attendance and comforts demanded by their pitiable condition had been
                     obtained. He became much interested in Pete, and took great pleasure in
                     conversing with him, and discussing the singular opinions so rigidly fixed in
                     his strong, one-sided nature.</p>
                  <p>We sometimes confound the strong mind with the wise one. It is a mistake;
                     whatever such a mind adopts will partake of its strength—but it may be folly as
                     well as wisdom. There is also a physical energy which may exist apart from the
                     mental. This man however, possessed strong powers of mind as well as body, but
                     they had been perverted, or the circumstances of his life had kept him where
                     the worst passions were most developed, and became the governing power. Force
                     could never subdue him, but kindness might. Having experienced little human
                     sympathy in his hard career, his estimate of men accorded with his only
                     knowledge of them. Pride and malice formed their chief characteristics, and
                     they were all disposed to be tyrants; it was his place to see that they did not
                     tyrannise over him. Thus he ever stood at bay. But under the influence of Mr.
                     Cranburn's manly and hearty interest he began to awake to better views of men
                     and things, and really for the first time in his life appeared inclined to
                     calmly reason and reflect.</p>
                  <p>In this lull after the cruel passions have reached their utmost, and, as it
                     were, naturally expended themselves, the soul, or inner spirit itself appears
                     to be more readily reached, and under the fostering care of a wise and
                     judicious sympathy becomes at last instructed in the knowledge of its own
                     intuitions. These whispering inner voices, at first childish and weak, craving
                     with hungry longing the love for which the soul has hitherto been starved,
                     gather strength presently, wooing the man away from his former low level of
                     thought and feeling. He becomes transformed,—looking out as from some grand
                     opening, glowing, throbbing, wondering, on a world attractive and beautiful
                     with life and goodness, virtuous effort, honor and love.</p>
                  <p>How changed under these new emotions the world became to Pete! But he now began
                     to realize that by the rash act he had committed he had shut himself out
                     forever from the world where he had accomplished so little, and might have done
                     so much. But the man's native strength sustained him; he did not murmur. His
                     great desire seemed to be to occupy every moment in thought and argument; to
                     prove and ponder over the knowledge, the new beauty and truth that flowed into
                     his awakened intellect.</p>
                  <p>Gradually both Weston and Pete became much restored in health, and Geoffrey
                     quite well. Mr. Cranburn was using efforts to have the preliminary examinations
                     entered into. In all the multiplicity of the cares of a prosperous business man
                     he still found time to interest himself for the welfare of these
                     unfortunates.</p>
                  <p>Of Mr. Cranburn's early life very little was known, even by his most intimate
                     friends. Although genial and sympathetic, and possessing a countenance that
                     inspired confidence and trust, there was a certain reserve about him which
                     prevented asking more than he volunteered to impart. He seldom spoke of
                     himself. Perhaps to none had he been as communicative as to these unfortunate
                     men, when he said, "I too am an American."</p>
                  <p>He was known to have come there a young man, and had been many years a clerk in
                     the establishment of which he was now principal. Unlike many of his
                     contemporaries in that country where so many go to make a fortune, and then
                     gladly leave so soon as that end is accomplished, having attained his wealth
                     there, he freely spent it there.</p>
                  <p>He had a magnificent establishment a few miles up the river, and all who had
                     anything to do with or for him were rewarded most munificently; but in his home
                     he lived rather secluded. The usual entertainments and hospitalities of social
                     life were not neglected, but he had no near friend or close companion. His life
                     was solitary. Whether he had ever loved or married none knew; he ever had
                     peculiarly avoided female society, and to his home, though so complete and
                     elegant in all its arrangements, no woman had ever been invited. The servants
                     numerous and well trained were native males. In earlier life this apparent
                     eccentricity had caused a great deal of curious comment, but people had at
                     length grown accustomed to it, and the peculiarity was now seldom subject of
                     remark.</p>
                  <p>An early day was appointed for the examination<pb n="74-75"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000038"/> amination of the prisoners before committing
                     them for trial.</p>
                  <p>The sympathies of the spectators were evidently most profoundly with the
                     accused. Peter Ackley, with his scarred and disfigured face excited interest
                     and commiseration; so did Geoffrey by his youth and intelligent appearance, and
                     Weston, with his bright eyes and deathly pallor. The latter was propped up in
                     his seat, and was supported on either side by his comrades when he stood up in
                     the dock to answer to his name.</p>
                  <p>But the prosecuting attorney soon turned the current of thought; his
                     representations throwing a new coloring over the aspect of events:</p>
                  <p>"In the early dawn of this morning," said he, "we followed to the grave one who
                     had been cut down wantonly in the very midst of life. In the dead hour of night
                     this stealthy villain, this fiend in human shape crept to his bedside, and with
                     the cool bloodthirstiness of a demon plunged the knife into that warm,
                     throbbing heart. There were no last words for a loving wife—no fatherly advice
                     for his helpless little ones. Alone and in terror he entered the unseen world,
                     facing the mystery of death without a moment for reflection to calm and
                     familiarise the soul to its awful change. Why, then, waste your sympathies,
                     your kindly emotions, upon one who by his acts has taken himself out of the
                     pale of sympathy with you all? Think of the widow, the orphan, even now
                     counting the hours that bring them nearer—ah, bitter disappointment!—to their
                     loving protector and guardian. Yes, turn from him, and only regret that in his
                     likeness you are made. And this young man, whose physical weakness so painfully
                     appeals to all our tenderest emotions—what shall we say of him? Let us close
                     our eyes to that pale exterior, and look impartially into his case—look into
                     the blackness of a heart that could smite a kind companion in the unguarded
                     hour of social intercourse and innocent festivity—that could ruthlessly cut off
                     a life in its first fresh opening—that could rend the soul of a poor, widowed
                     mother!" here Weston groaned aloud. The speaker continued with increasing
                     pathos: "His sisters—oh, who will break this news to them? this last news that
                     they will ever hear from him who sailed away from them full of high hopes, full
                     of brotherly love—brave, kind and strong. Oh, poor unfortunates! Oh, broken
                     ties, torn affections, poverty unalleviated by any hope of his return, who was
                     'the only son of his mother, and she is a widow!"'</p>
                  <p>There were many moist eyes in the room, but none wept so bitterly, in utter
                     abandonment of wo as the unfortunate Weston himself.</p>
                  <p>As the examination proceeded it was ascertained that there was no testimony
                     whatever to sustain charges against Geoffrey. The mate, Simpson, and old Jacob
                     were examined as witnesses. Simpson endeavored to appease his accusing
                     conscience by giving ample testimony of the provocation which Geoffrey had
                     received before making the assault. This statement quite mollified old Jacob's
                     feelings toward Simpson. He could not let the opportunity pass without a good
                     word for his favorite. Geoffrey: "As fine a young fellow as ever pulled a rope,
                     yer honors! And I have no doubt if he keeps to it he'll make as able a seaman
                     as ever stepped the deck!" To the old man's way of thinking this was the
                     highest praise that could be given.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was thus released under the most pleasant circumstances. But for the
                     others, alas, the testimony was too conclusive to admit of the slightest
                     amelioration of their doom. They were on the earliest opportunity to be sent
                     back to the port from whence they came, to be tried for the crime of wilful
                     murder on the high seas.</p>
                  <p>Poor, unfortunate Weston, half delirious with the fever and excitement of his
                     system, uttered a wild cry as of sharp pain, as this sentence was pronounced,
                     and Geoffrey involuntarily rose to his feet. "Gentlemen," he said, with an
                     earnest gesture, "can't you stay this? These men are not murderers! They are
                     not of the stuff of which murderers are made! Do you never, gentlemen, look
                     into causes? These men have hearts and feelings—are impressible to love and
                     kindness. Yes, a little child could lead them!—but they were goaded to their
                     acts. In the human consciousness is implanted an intuitive sense of right and
                     wrong; it urges us to hold inviolate from every stain our individuality. But
                     some are morbidly sensitive to these things, and this man," pointing to Pete,
                     "is one of those; no finer feeling, no keener sense of honor, could exist in
                     the most refined nature among you, gentlemen, than he possessed. And this
                     overweening consciousness, this nice sense of what is our due, was constantly
                     being insulted, taunted, degraded, on board that vessel, till he maddened under
                     it. The last provocation came, and the brooding monomaniac became for the time
                     a demon! But gentlemen reflect;—think of what brought him to this, and send him
                     not away where he must certainly suffer the utmost! Think whether under the
                     same circumstances you might not all have done the same. And this young man, so
                     delicate—to make again that terrible voyage, I shudder to think of the
                     consequences. But excuse me,—forgive me if I have transgressed—I feel so much
                     for my comrades—let it be my apology."</p>
                  <p>He sat down as hastily as he had risen, while his face flushed with a glow of
                     confusion. Leaning his head on the back of a raised seat in front of him, in
                     the agitation and excitement of many contending feelings, he did not notice the
                     removal of the prisoners and the emptying of the court-room. But few beside
                     himself lingered. Many had felt with him in the intense outburst of their
                     feelings—but what could be done? the law was explicit, and the crime
                     manifest.</p>
                  <p>How long he had sat there he did not know, but a friendly eye had watched him.
                     A kind hand was laid on his shoulder, he looked quickly up and saw Mr. Cranburn
                     looking on him with the deepest expression of interest.</p>
                  <p>"And your name is Geoffrey Luperthorp,—I had not heard your full name until
                     to-day. It sounded familiar—of what Luperthorps are you?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey briefly described the character and position of his family.</p>
                  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Cranburn, shaking his head, "I have heard of them, but I did not
                     know any of them. And what, my young friend, have you decided on for your own
                     pursuit in life?"</p>
                  <p>About this Geoffrey had very little to say. Unlooked for circumstances had so
                     crowded on him lately that he had little time for reflection. He answered,
                     faintly smiling, that he had come there to seek his fortune, and being an
                     entire stranger, he would have to be guided by the chances which might turn up.
                     "But at present, sir," said he, "I must follow those poor fellows. I feel very
                     uneasy about Weston; I think he is seriously ill."</p>
                  <p>"That is my opinion too," said Mr. Cranburn, "Indeed I thought so from the
                     first time I saw him, poor fellow! It has not been through a strictly unlawful
                     process, but he has been as certainly murdered as those other victims of an
                     unlooked for doom. The shock to his system,—which I take to be naturally a
                     delicate one,—in that foul, burning hole, with the loneliness, and want of
                     common necessaries, has literally killed him. So I told the mate to-day; and
                     that, though there was no law to reach him. I held him responsible for that
                     young man's life. But let us he done with this unworthy wretch, and consider
                     what can be effected for these poor unfortunates. Anticipating Weston's growing
                     illness, now quite apparent, I wrote a few days since to a Hindoo lady,—one of
                     those excellent women who devote their lives to acts of beneficence—to visit
                     this young man. She is, or was traveling in a distant part of the country, but
                     in answer to my letter informs me that she will certainly be at the jail this
                     evening, at any rate before midnight. Let us walk to my office, and on the way
                     I will tell you about this noble woman—this holy mother, as we often call
                     her."</p>
                  <p>Leaving the hall of justice, they proceeded to Mr. Cranburn's office, which,
                     with his extensive warehouse was situated on the river. The way thither led
                     through the Mardaum, an extensive plain stretching<pb n="76-77"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000039"/> along the river; here the heat, although it was
                     noon of an October day, was not at all oppressive. As they slowly traversed the
                     broad and level road, and passed the noble acqueduct, the breeze from the water
                     was cool and refreshing.</p>
                  <p>"This Madame Duleep, of whom I was speaking," said Mr. Cranburn, "is a Hindoo
                     lady of high rank and immense wealth. She is about eighty years old, but in
                     looking at her you would not suppose it possible she had reached such an
                     advanced period of life. The great forces of her magnificent nature seem to
                     endow her with an undying vitality. I have been told that in spite of all the
                     consequences attached to such a step by the rigid tenets of her people, she
                     married in early life a young Frenchman, and by that step lost caste forever.
                     She was an only child, and her father one of those we occasionally meet with in
                     all countries, who will think for themselves. He was a man of wealth and
                     influence, and could do this in a measure. He had his daughter educated
                     thoroughly; she can speak English, among other languages, as though it were her
                     native tongue, and has been accustomed to the society of the intelligent of all
                     nations, with whom her father delighted to associate.</p>
                  <p>"She accompanied her husband soon after her marriage to France. He lived but a
                     few years, and during her absence her father also died, leaving his entire
                     property to his daughter when she should return to her native country. She
                     remained a widow, and has managed her own estate exclusively. Through her
                     energy and skill its large revenue increases yearly, for she holds that without
                     money, however good our intentions, or elevated our aspirations, we can
                     accomplish but little.</p>
                  <p>"Since her youth up to this time all that she expends is with reference to the
                     interests of others. She has a fine house but a short distance up the
                     river—capacious and well appointed. Its doors are open day and night to receive
                     any who may come. The young, the old, male or female, the decrepit, the feeble,
                     of whatever nation or creed, are admitted where they are comforted and their
                     wants attended to, and they go or stay as they please. It is remarkable that
                     where so many thousands have been thus entertained so few impositions have been
                     perpetrated. But everything is conducted on such benignant and generous
                     principles the heart must be base indeed that could take advantage of it. There
                     is little temptation to deceit where nothing is suspected, and the desire to
                     evade restrictions cannot be active where no restriction is laid down. These
                     benefactions are not alone confined to the impoverished, though no remuneration
                     is ever received. In a population like that of British India, where so many are
                     strangers—young men and old men—away from the protecting influences of wife or
                     mother or sister—it is a blessing to have such a home to go to if they are sick
                     or dispirited, or needing advice, or affectionate words of encouragement. This
                     lady herself travels a great deal. Wherever there is pestilence, sickness, or
                     war, or any affliction in any part of the country—there she is found. She is
                     free to travel everywhere. Native and foreign population alike respect her. To
                     all the hospitals and prisons she is admitted at any time. But during her
                     absence her home is left under the care of able superintendents and assistants,
                     and is always open to all. And that reminds me that the young English-woman—the
                     lady who came out with you in that unfortunate vessel—called on me shortly
                     after her arrival to make inquiries in regard to a regiment supposed to be
                     quartered in or near Calcutta. She is entirely unacquainted here, but has a
                     friend or friends in the regiment. I find her a very intelligent and amiable
                     young lady, although rather reserved. She does not say who are these friends in
                     whom she is interested, but earnestly requested me to obtain her the officers'
                     names of that particular regiment. I told her that it was away at present, and
                     had been for some months, but that I would try and ascertain every thing in
                     regard to it.</p>
                  <p>"It has been rather tedious and trouble some to get all the particulars I
                     wished, but I have <choice>
                        <sic>suceeded</sic>
                        <corr>succeeded</corr>
                     </choice>, and this morning before fore I attended court she was at my office.
                     She expected to proceed up the country, but the regiment is ordered back here,
                     and is now on its return march. Probably it will arrive within the week. At any
                     rate it would be useless for her to start; she would not know where to find
                     them. I noticed that she looked ill this morning—flushed and feverish—though in
                     answer to my inquiries she said she had merely a severe headache. This climate
                     may prove too much for the young woman, I fear. I mentioned to her good Madame
                     Duleep's home, where she could rest and refresh for a few days, while waiting.
                     At my earnest request she consented to go there, and I sent her in my own boat,
                     with a letter to the superintendent. I know she will be well cared for."</p>
                  <p>They had now reached Mr. Cranburn's office, or rather offices. There were a
                     number of them, full of busy writers, divided by a low partition leaving free
                     the circulation of air. The building was a roomy and capacious one, a single
                     story in hight, the ceiling reaching to the open dome and arched roof above.
                     Its front faced the water, with a large portico looking out on the shipping,
                     while around its sides were long windows reaching to the floor, open to let in
                     the air, but shaded by dark venetian blinds; altogether it was a cool,
                     cheerful, pleasant looking place.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn ushered Geoffrey into his private room, and ordered cooling drinks
                     and refreshments to be brought. While partaking of these Mr. Cranburn was
                     silent, often looking at his young companion with a sort of preoccupied
                     expression on his benevolent, thoughtful face. Was he thinking of his
                     loneliness—lonely though so many surrounded him—lonely perhaps because he
                     missed the closeness and warmth of nearer affections? Did the presence of this
                     frank and manly, yet altogether unassuming youth recall his own young days? He
                     sighed, a deep, sad sigh. Perhaps he grieved that he had not such a son—and
                     felt the emptiness of all that he had gained in wealth and honor, lacking the
                     heart-warmth of family ties and home affections. In the great city, in his
                     business, on change, in his commercial transactions, the rich, the highly
                     respected Mr. Cranburn could command every attention, but in these silent home
                     hours how was it? Doubtless many delightful hours might pass away in his study
                     for he was a learned man; but there were two sides to his character—he
                     possessed an emotional and affectional nature, requiring these social
                     endearments and nearer relations. Why did he seclude himself in his advancing
                     age from these sympathies and loves, and every day home affections which might
                     greet and cheer, and fill to overflowing that great, warm, loving heart?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the fact of Geoffrey's being a fellow countryman aroused this special
                     interest in the young man. In a distant land those of our own language and
                     clime seem singularly near to us, and we almost feel to hail them as brothers.
                     And this youth was born and reared in his native city.</p>
                  <p>"My young friend," said Mr. Cranburn, briefly, as Geoffrey, having satisfied
                     the youthful appetite rendered keen by his long walk, and the exhausting
                     emotions of the morning, drew back his chair from the table, "as I suggested
                     before, I wish to know whether you have fixed on any plan for your future
                     movements."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey shook his head. "I have not, sir. A thought came across me to-day—it
                     may be fancy, however,—which gives me much occasion for reflection. I never
                     before felt such an ardent wish for power as I did to-day, in order to defend
                     my comrades. Such a profession, it seems to me, where I could do such work,
                     would call out all my energies. I know very little about business generally—it
                     never altogether took my fancy. But I know I must make my living somehow, and I
                     shall feel it my duty to give up all preferences, and do to the best of my
                     ability whatever comes to hand. I would be very much obliged, Mr. Cranburn, if
                     you would favor me with your advice. I certainly cannot dream of taking up the
                     study of law in a strange country, before I have learned how to earn my bread
                     in it."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn answered that the profession<pb n="78-79"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000040"/> sion he alluded to was a noble one. "To be,"
                     said he, with a warmth that was almost like enthusiasm, "to be the defender of
                     elevated principles, the champion of justice and right, the mover of large
                     bodies of men by the powers of a controlling eloquence—to raise the
                     oppressed—to lift the burden from the weary—to more evenly balance the cares
                     and struggles of life—all this might satisfy the highest ambition. From the
                     little I have seen of you I should judge you were well adapted to such a
                     pursuit; but it is and must be slow work in preparation. You are young though,
                     and have plenty of time. I have a proposition then to make.</p>
                  <p>"I have been for some time on the look out for just such a young man as
                     yourself, to take charge of my private office. Most of our clerks are natives.
                     I want one who understands our language thoroughly, and is somewhat acquainted
                     with local peculiarities, to attend to my English and American correspondence,
                     and other similar matters. The situation will allow you considerable leisure,
                     and then you can pursue the study of law; I am a lawyer myself, at least that
                     was my profession in my younger days, and I gained considerable credit in the
                     profession. I can therefore direct your studies, and it will afford me much
                     pleasure to do so."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was entirely overcome by this unexpected offer, and by the kind manner
                     in which it was made.</p>
                  <p>"What shall I say, sir?" he said eagerly, "to express my gratitude, my joyful
                     acceptance of your kindness!"</p>
                  <p>"You need not say anything, only accept. But the office is coupled with a
                     provision. You must come to my home, and be with me as a son. And, my dear
                     boy—" seeing that Geoffrey was about to speak, "you need not consider yourself
                     under any obligation. I assure you that I am the beneficiary. Come with me, and
                     bear the quiet that surrounds a feeble old man. Come with me, and charm away
                     some of those hours that have now become oppressive. I cannot mix with the
                     world—I am heart sick," he paused a moment, wiping away a tear. "Come and be
                     the link between myself and it. I will not confine you to my monotonous life; I
                     know what youth is.—You may go and come as you please, but only let my home be
                     your home, and try to make it the place you love best."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey could not speak. "Never mind," said Mr. Cranburn, "it is all settled,
                     I consider it so. You had better now return to the jail, and be with Weston
                     until some change comes, or the good madam arrives."</p>
                  <p>With the frankness natural to him, and warmed into new life by the kindly
                     attention of his benefactor, Geoffrey related the circumstances of his past
                     life. With hightened color, and voice that trembled with emotion, he described
                     those who were so near and dear to him at home,—aunt Edith his more than
                     mother, and all the rest. He related the incidents connected with the death of
                     his father which had resulted in throwing him out upon the world.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn commended his spirit, "You did right," said he heartily. I believe
                     in you and in these friends of yours. It refreshes my heart! I feel as if I
                     knew them all, and they were quite near to me!"</p>

                  <head type="sub">DEATH OF WESTON.—A HINDOO SAINT.</head>
                  <p>WHEN Geoffrey arrived at the jail the day was far advanced. He found poor
                     Weston in a sadly exhausted state, yet sitting upright at the side of his low
                     bed. He had been vainly persuaded to lie down—having been crying out for
                     Geoffrey ever since leaving the court-room, when he felt that his fate was
                     forever sealed. The feeble nature of the poor fellow sank under the struggle;
                     there was no power or pride within him to retain the consciousness of suffering
                     within his own breast; he needed some one to comfort him, and upon whose
                     stronger nature he could lean.</p>
                  <p>He was sure that Geoffrey had deserted him.</p>
                  <p>"I am so wicked," he sobbed, "he is glad to be away from me,—glad to be rid of
                     me altogether. Oh, why was I born?"</p>
                  <p>Pete, more philosophic, had tried his best to console him; true it was in a
                     rather rough way, and did little toward helping the weak and sensitive
                     youth.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, my lad," he said, "we've had our day!—let others take our place.
                     The world would go on well enough without us,—maybe a little better.
                     Nevertheless its hard—hard by all that's holy, to go out of it as we shall. We
                     all love ourselves, even although we know there's not much for others to love
                     about us, and it does seem confounded hard—" Pete wiped the big drops of sweat
                     from his forehead,—"confounded hard to be remembered only as the bloodthirsty
                     scoundrels that had nothing in them but murder and hate. Never mind my hearty,"
                     as his companion uttered a deep groan, "cheer up! Many a better man has been as
                     much misunderstood,—let it go! Let us remember we are men, we must not disgrace
                     ourselves—and it may be," here his voice softened to a gentle whisper, "it may
                     be, as we have been told long ago, that there is One who knows us, and bad as
                     we are, knows we are not all bad! And we have had mothers who would love us
                     through all, my lad, and in their love and mercy maybe—maybe—but I dare not say
                     it—Lord have mercy on us!"</p>
                  <p>But when the heavy key grated in the lock, and the iron-studded door slowly
                     opened as Geoffrey stepped in, then their joy was as great as their recent
                     sorrow. Weston became wild with excitement.</p>
                  <p>He was now so much elated that he flung his arms around Geoffrey, while Pete
                     also shook him by the hand again and again, "You are a fine fellow," he cried,
                     "You were the only one to say a word for us to-day! This complaining chap has
                     been saying you wouldn't come near us again—but I knew better!"</p>
                  <p>"And so did I, said Weston with an innocent, apologetic air, "but I couldn't
                     help it—I was so afraid. Oh, Geoffrey, what should I do? I would have died of
                     grief if you had not come!" And he clasped him in his arms as though he never
                     would let him go. "I think," said Geoffrey, looking at the pale face, and
                     trembling hands, "I think, Weston, that you ought to lie down."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, I cannot lie down," said the other, with a look of alarm, "I have such
                     frightful thoughts when I lie down—my blood becomes on fire. Ah," and a tremor
                     passed over him, and a look of wildness mingled with terror shone in his eye,
                     "they called things by their right names down there, this morning! They called
                     us murderers. There was no beating about the bush—we are murderers. And there
                     have been visiters here, Geoffrey—two persons—they have just gone—that I am
                     going to die. At least, so I inferred, for they asked me if I was prepared to
                     die, and ready to meet my God. Oh, Geoffrey, they may have done their duty—but
                     it seems cruel to ask me such a question."</p>
                  <p>The injudicious, well-meaning people had doubtless gone away with the
                     comfortable consciousness of having fulfilled their duty in alarming this weak
                     and timid youth, and fitting him more speedily for the doom of which they

                        <corr>forewarned</corr>
                     </choice> him.</p>
                  <p>"They handed me this little sheet," said Weston humbly, "look at it, Geoffrey,
                     'The unrepentant Sinner's Doom:' I am the sinner—how can I repent? Meet my
                     God!—there is no God for the murderer. I knew all the time what they meant,
                     hell and the devil are his portion. Oh, Geoffrey, Geoffrey, just read this—read
                     it—see what it says, there is no hope for me! and tell me," he said, looking
                     piteously at his friend, "tell me like a good fellow, do you think I must
                     die—and how soon? Oh tell me this, Geoffrey!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey hardly knew what to say. He was sadly distressed; his heart ached for
                     the poor fellow. He knew it would not do to tell that weak and trembling nature
                     all he felt. All that he could answer, was, "It is not for me to know, Weston.
                     But you must stop this kind of talk—you must be more quiet, and lie down and
                     rest, or you<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5590-00000041"/> will kill yourself; don't
                     you say so, too, Pete?"</p>
                  <p>"To be sure I do! that's what I've been telling him. He has not eat or drank
                     one mouthful since yesterday, and no fellow could stand it!"</p>
                  <p>"That just reminds me," said Geoffrey "that Mr. Cranburn put this bottle of
                     wine in my pocket, purposely for you—how could I have so long forgotten it? And
                     here are some sweet <choice>
                        <sic>buscuit</sic>
                        <corr>biscuit</corr>
                     </choice>."</p>
                  <p>Having partaken of these dainties, Weston was so much refreshed that he
                     submitted to lie down if Geoffrey would sit beside him. He could not be
                     persuaded to cease talking; his heart seemed to overflow with affection.</p>
                  <p>"How well I like you Pete!" he said, And you, Geoffrey—I never had a
                     brother—but I love you as much as I loved my sister, at home. Ah, how I have
                     disgraced you all! You would not care to own me for a friend. And think of my
                     father and my sweet sister, and all that know us—how they will feel! oh, how
                     they will feel when I am publicly tried for a hideous crime! If I could only be
                     kept here I would not care what was done to me. I have been trouble and sorrow
                     enough to my family, and now to bring this everlasting stain upon them—it is
                     too much!" he gasped as if it were his last breath.</p>
                  <p>"But Weston," said Geoffrey, anxious by any means to soothe and cheer him, "you
                     know that I and others have not learned your true name, and a public trial will
                     easily admit of disguising your appearance; and who will think of looking after
                     a Weston?"</p>
                  <p>"That's true!" and the young face lit up with a bright smile, "you've just hit
                     it! I've never told any one since I left home what my real name was. Isn't it
                     lucky?" he shouted in one of his impulsive bursts of joy.</p>
                  <p>"Come now, this won't altogether do," interrupted Geoffrey, playfully,
                     "remember your promise—I was to have this sister of yours for my wife. You have
                     talked me quite in love with her—and I can't give her up so easily."</p>
                  <p>"And you shall have her, my fine fellow! I shall be proud to give her to
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"But how am I do find her without the name?"</p>
                  <p>"That's so," and again that brooding frightened look spread over the almost
                     boyish countenance, and he whispered, "I had forgotten—I had indeed for that
                     moment; but you wouldn't care, Geoffrey, to have for your wife the sister of a
                     murderer, would you?"</p>
                  <p>"Now be done with this, Weston—I'll have no more of it," said his friend,
                     decidedly, "you always were, and never will be anything other than my well
                     loved companion that helped me so manfully to bear my hard and rugged life of
                     late. You have been unfortunate—I might have done the same in the same
                     circumstances. You are no worse than the rest of us—only be quiet, and get
                     strong, and then you may say what you please."</p>
                  <p>"You won't be angry with me, then? you will forgive me, Geoffrey—you don't know
                     how differently things are beginning to seem to me! I used to think it was all
                     pleasure I was seeking—and that every fellow had a right to be happy in his own
                     way—but it now seems to me all thoroughly selfish.</p>
                  <p>"I was so taken up with my own feelings I never thought of others. I remember
                     saying to my beautiful sister, the morning after my mother was buried, that I
                     would go away where no one would ever hear of me—for there was no one to love
                     me now that my mother was gone. How cruel I was to talk so to her! I know so
                     much better now! And when she still clung to me, and plead that I would not
                     leave her and my poor father to such utter loneliness, I roughly said she must
                     let me alone—I could take care of myself, and they had better forget me as
                     quickly as possible. 'But we cannot forget,' she cried bitterly, 'we cannot
                     forget—that is our terrible punishment!' Oh, would that we could forget! my
                     poor sister! A fearful retribution has indeed pursued me! Geoffrey you shall
                     have her name and mine—and you will find her and tell her all about me. But it
                     must not be soon—the sting must all be gone! They think I am dead,—it is now
                     more than six months since I have heard from them. Let it be so. Do not open
                     these painful wounds afresh. Let it be some years before you speak of me. Will
                     you promise me this, Geoffrey?"</p>
                  <p>"I will promise, most assuredly."</p>
                  <p>"Then get me pen and paper."</p>
                  <p>With slow and trembling hand he traced a few characters—folded, sealed, and
                     gave the paper to his friend. He smiled as he did so, and said, "When you
                     deliver this, I expect you will be a great and rich man. You always do right
                     Geoffrey, and success must follow."</p>
                  <p>"Not always, Weston, by any means; but I will sacredly preserve this memorial,
                     and should I ever meet your sister will tell her of you—of your truth—your
                     honor, and of the inward beauty of a character that could never do a mean or
                     dishonorable act. I will tell her how I have received strength and instruction
                     from you, and how I loved you."</p>
                  <p>"Is this so, Geoffrey? Can this be so? Do you love me—and am I not so bad?" he
                     said wistfully. "But it is your own goodness that makes you think so. Oh,
                     Geoffrey, I dare not be so deceived! There is no rest for me—no forgetfulness
                     for the murderer. He lives forever and forever in endless torture." His lips
                     grew whiter, his breath came short, "God deals the blow," he said, and fell
                     back faintingly on the couch.</p>
                  <p>"Who dares to utter such words?" said a voice near by. This is blasphemy—God is
                     love!" Both started, and turned their eyes toward the door. They rested upon
                     what appeared to the sad group gathered in that desolate room, a vision of
                     strength and peace. A woman, who seemed indeed the embodiment of that love of
                     which she spoke. A calm and holy influence emanated from her, as she stood
                     erect in the soft rays of the declining sun. In speaking of this noble lady, I
                     can scarcely introduce her in the usual way, as Mrs. So-and-so. She seemed too
                     truly herself—an embodiment of a divine individuality. In the full fruition of
                     her mature years, with an exterior conveying at once the impression of great
                     intellectual power, and the refinement of education and position, she appeared
                     as it were to stand aloof from the ordinary usages and etiquettes which govern
                     the daily converse of smaller natures. Few are gifted with all the attributes
                     both inward and outward of a clearly-defined excellence. Many an elevated
                     sentiment falls unheeded on the ear, because of the awkward and ungracious
                     manner of its delivery. So, many a warm and outreaching purpose is strangled by
                     the hesitancy and timidity of its originator. Only once in a while in some
                     kindly mood does nature beautifully adapt her outer to her inner perfections,
                     rendering the one efficient and expressive by the fitness of the other. In the
                     full development of an elevated womanhood, the splendid endowments of this lady
                     accompanied every external grace. Her form was commanding and dignified, her
                     features full of sweetness and beauty.</p>
                  <p>Her dress, to the eye of a stranger, would doubtless have appeared peculiar.
                     The long white robe enveloping her stately figure was fastened round the waist
                     with a girdle, from which were suspended keys and small bags filled with
                     healing herbs and reviving essences. Around the small, finely formed head,
                     covered with hair of that intense whiteness, soft curling and silken as an
                     infants, which we sometimes see in the very aged, was twisted a linen turban.
                     Her complexion was dark, though much fairer than is usually seen among her
                     countrywomen; its rich brown tint showed but few wrinkles, and her bright dark
                     eye shone gently and benignantly, with almost the lustre of youth, as she
                     advanced toward the group.</p>
                  <p>"Madame Duleep," said Geoffrey, rising and bowing low.</p>
                  <p>"Yes my son, and you are Geoffrey Luperthorp, and this is Peter Ackley." She
                     spoke distinctly and at her ease, as though the English language were her own.
                     "And this" she said stepping to the couch, and taking the invalid's hand
                     tenderly, "this is our sick young friend, Robert Weston."</p>
                  <p>He looked at her as though an angel had<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5590-00000042"
                     /> indeed descended from the skies to visit one so humiliated, so wretched and
                     so outcast as he deemed himself.</p>
                  <p>"Until you are better" she said, "you are to be my boy, and you are to obey me
                     as if I were your mother—my poor, sick child;" fondly passing her hand over the
                     fair forehead, and brushing back the light silken hair. The action seemed the
                     impulse of an instinctive affection, the offspring of her warm, human heart,
                     and was received by the youth with the simple naturalness of an affectionate
                     child, as though he recognised in this lady the presence of his mother from
                     heaven.</p>
                  <p>A servant accompanied her bearing delicacies and refreshments, and a basket of
                     sweet, clean linen. The invalid was soon surrounded with comfort and
                     cleanliness; his face and person were bathed in refreshing liquids, clean
                     garments were put upon him, his soft hair was brushed and combed. Sitting
                     propped up among the snowy pillows, his face, for the moment, peaceful and
                     serene, his large eyes looking out clear and brilliant, there was little in
                     this countenance, divested of every vestige of coarseness, and the roughness of
                     sea-life, to indicate one who was without the pale of society, a criminal and a
                     convict.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, mother," he whispered, "how happy I feel!"</p>
                  <p>He experienced in common with all who came near Madame Duleep a sense of rest
                     and holy calm, which pervaded her very atmosphere as with a halo. "I do feel so
                     happy!" he repeated, "Oh, mother, what can it mean?"</p>
                  <p>"Rest now, my dear child," she said, soothingly, "You are fatigued; rest, and I
                     will sit by and watch you."</p>
                  <p>As waters quench the hottest flame, even so do these sympathies born of the
                     soul's best love destroy evil tendencies, and that apparently inherent bent to
                     wrong-doing which many deem twin-born with the spirit itself. Pete, the surly,
                     dogged Pete, ever irate, and disposed to look shy on any expression of
                     sentiment, now drew nearer and pressed close to the mother's side, bowing his
                     head reverently as he listened to the low, sweet tones of her murmuring
                     voice.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey too came nearer; he thought of home—of aunt Edith, and all the loves
                     and affections of his life. As she talked the sufferer dropped into a quiet
                     sleep.</p>
                  <p>Night was advancing, and through the dusky quiet of the room, the starlight
                     shed its soft and solemn lustre.</p>
                  <p>The aged woman glanced thoughtfully from the open window. "How near we approach
                     Heaven," she said, "in these better moments."</p>
                  <p>"Heaven!" said the sick youth, starting with a wild tremor. His eyes shone
                     fearfully, even in the subdued light pervading the prison-room. "Oh, there is
                     no Heaven for us! I and my comrade are murderers! Oh Pete! Pete!" he almost
                     screamed, "we belong to the devil. Look out on that sky—isn't it
                     lovely—look—how it sparkles and dazzles beyond. There they say is the mystery,
                     and the glory! But it is not for us. There is no Heaven for the murderer. Long,
                     long ago I learned that. There's a terrible abyss for them! It opens dark and
                     dreadful! Help, oh, help!"</p>
                  <p>He raised his head from the pillow; his eyes glared. He seemed strong enough
                     now, grasping the hand of Geoffrey and of the kind mother with a fearful
                     clutch.</p>
                  <p>"My poor, foolish child?" she said, gently soothing him, "Poor victim of
                     phantom terrors impressed on a timid, unreasoning nature! Take this draught, it
                     will refresh you, and when you feel a little quiet we will talk this matter
                     over. Why do you doubt the immutability of God's law of love! In early life I
                     suppose these ideas were in-stilled into you by loving lips, whose truthfulness
                     you never could question. You were instructed to avoid sin and passion and
                     wrong. You learned the lesson of fear and punishment—of an avenging God;—rather
                     than the wisdom which teaches that the consequences of our crimes are their
                     sufficient punishment in this life, and that evil is to be shunned because it
                     affects the condition of others and wrongs ourselves by a misappropriation of
                     the gifts of heaven. Is not this so, my son?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I cannot think! I cannot think! I can only feel. I am so wicked—where
                     shall I hide from the anger and wrath of a righteous, but jealous God!"</p>
                  <p>"Anger, wrath, jealousy! My son, these are not the words to use. To me they
                     seem blasphemous, you judge the Infinite and Incomprehensible by the finite.
                     These expressions, with the passions they represent, belong only to ourselves.
                     I can understand the wailings of a sensitive conscience, mourning the folly,
                     the misspent hours, the prostration of all the nobler faculties of the soul—but
                     I cannot understand this leveling of the Divinity, from whom, in the magnitude,
                     the perfection, the universality of law, we gain our highest conception of
                     generosity, of disinterested benevolence, and changeless equanimity. I cannot
                     understand this attributing to the Deity the varying moods of our changeful
                     human nature—to be angry and pleased—to censure and to be reconciled again. If
                     the God you worship be a principle, then we cannot conceive of change in him;
                     if he be a personality, then do not degrade his intelligent supervision of his
                     creatures below the level of our most crude ideas of justice; let not the
                     penalty he affixes to transgression be altogether disproportionate to the
                     offence. Your life, my son, has been the merest speck on the ocean of time, and
                     yet you tell me you must suffer an eternity of punishment. Think of it!"</p>
                  <p>Weston caught both her hands and gazed into her face with a pleading
                     tenderness.</p>
                  <p>"Think of it, my son,—you have a soul that now only longs to be free from the
                     circumstances that made it err—that aspires henceforth to do only what is
                     right."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my mother," he tremblingly said, "you speak my very thoughts! I would
                     indeed make restitution for the wrong I have done, and atone for all. Oh, that
                     I could!"</p>
                  <p>"Then rise, my son, above these crude traditions, these childish fears. Let the
                     soul's intuitions speak for themselves. Are they love or hate?"</p>
                  <p>"Hate!" repeated Weston, "how could I hate? I love—I love—I love you all!"</p>
                  <p>His thin arms were extended; his eyes became intently fixed; their far glance
                     seemed to penetrate into unseen things.</p>
                  <p>Then the eyelids drooped again, the weary head rested upon the bosom of the
                     pitying woman at his side. "Be silent;" she said, motioning the others to
                     withdraw, "Leave him to me."</p>
                  <p>During the long hours of that night neither Geoffrey nor Pete slept. The good
                     Madame still watched. Weston breathed heavily; he did not wake. It was evident
                     that he was slowly passing into that sleep that knows no earthly waking.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey and his companion retired into a remote corner of the room, where
                     their whispering voices might not disturb the sleeper. They had many important
                     things to speak of.</p>
                  <p>"Peter," said Geoffrey, "I was startled to hear your name to-day. I have never
                     noticed, or perhaps heard it before. When they called you to answer to the name
                     of Ackley, it struck me as strangely familiar, that is, as if I had known it
                     under circumstances half forgotten, which it faintly recalled. Were you ever
                     married?"</p>
                  <p>Peter gazed at him in astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"I do not ask this from any idle curiosity. You ought to know me better than
                     that. I have a reason for wishing to know, but if you have any objection to
                     answering—let it go."</p>
                  <p>"None at all—only it is so long since any one cared to know about me, that I
                     had almost begun to forget that I had a past life. Ah, no! not that, either:
                     for memory every day as I grow older brings more clearly before me the by-gone
                     times. Yes, I <emph>was</emph> married; and to as nice a girl as ever lived.
                     But it was a foolish marriage. She was a mere child compared with me—though I
                     believe she loved me with all the love of her young, childish heart. I have a
                     letter from her here.—"</p>
                  <p>He drew an old worn pocketbook from his breast, and taking therefrom a letter
                     worn through at every fold, said bitterly, "I am now nearly done with it—I
                        have<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5590-00000043"/> paid off the last score. Yes!
                     that infernal villain," and he grit his teeth with the old malignity, "but I've
                     done with him—he's gone! I'll tell you all about this letter. I left my wife
                     for a long East India voyage. She was then near her confinement. The
                     understanding with the ship owners was that she should receive half pay. This
                     man, for whose worthless life I have risked my soul's everlasting peace, was
                     one of the owners. We were detained in port an unusual time; we could not get a
                     return car-go—and he refused to advance her any more money, on the plea, she
                     writes, that he was informed that I expressed great dissatisfaction and
                     impatience of the detention, and there was a probability I might run away—the
                     hypocrite! the contemptible cowardly devil! She begged in vain—she was sick,
                     her little girl was sick. 'I have such a cough, Peter dear,' she says, 'baby
                     and I must starve; I cannot work.'</p>
                  <p>"This is the last I ever heard of her or the child. She left her friends in the
                     eastern states, to look for me in New York, but she never returned. We made
                     every inquiry about her, but in vain. We were poor and little known, and the
                     thing soon died out. But I registered my vow of revenge, and I have kept it. I
                     lost sight of that man once—it was only when I stepped on board that fatal ship
                     that I saw him again. But I remembered him well."</p>
                  <p>"How many years since is that letter dated?" asked Geoffrey.</p>
                  <p>"About fourteen and a half."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said Geoffrey, exultingly, "I think I can tell you something of that
                     daughter. He remembered distinctly all the widow Neil had told him of the early
                     life of the poor Leil, the beggar girl. The description of her mother, and all
                     the sick and dying woman had said concerning herself, accorded strangely with
                     Peter's account. The heart of the unfortunate man was riven with fresh anguish
                     as he listened to Geoffrey's recital. He recognised and realized it all—her
                     last words of affection, so like her. Yes, it was certainly his wife—his young,
                     fair wife. And the little girl—his child—what was to become of her? Again his
                     strong feelings almost overcame him. Geoffrey consoled him, and endeavored to
                     persuade him to a more cheerful view of things.</p>
                  <p>"You can see her, Peter," he said hopefully, "I know that I can arrange it so
                     that you will."</p>
                  <p>They talked the matter over until Peter grew quite calm and happy. He felt that
                     there was something for him in the future, and again he shook hands with
                     Geoffrey, declaring vehemently that it was a blessing to have met with him, and
                     that he would never cease to be grateful. Thus they conversed until near dawn,
                     when both lay down to take a short rest.</p>
                  <p>Weston still slumbered, breathing heavily; Madame Duleep and her faithful
                     attendant alternately sat beside him, fanning the fevered brow, moistening the
                     parched lips, and watching tenderly the feeble movements which indicated fast
                     failing strength. So gradual had been the ebbing of the tide of life that when
                     the final struggle came it was scarcely perceptible. He who had been so full of
                     fears, met the messenger at last without dread. Smiling, as one awaking from a
                     pleasant dream, he opened his eyes and begged to be raised.</p>
                  <p>"Are you near me, all?" he said, "Geoffrey take my hand."</p>
                  <p>The voice had scarcely ceased to echo when he was gone.</p>
                  <p>"I am happy," said Madame Duleep, as she laid the head gently back on the
                     pillow, "I am happy that there is no earthly mother here to mourn."</p>
                  <p>Death touched with a solemn beauty the small features, the wavy hair, even the
                     weak and delicate mouth, so indicative of a variable, purposeless, but
                     affectionate nature. Death wrought his awful mystery in the hushed countenance,
                     and set his seal of dignity even upon its weakness.</p>
                  <p>There is something most peculiarly sad and subduing in the passing away of a
                     young life. As Weston's late companions stood beside that humble couch, and
                     gazed on the silent form, their tears flowed unchecked. They had loved him
                     truly. He was one of those simple, warm-hearted natures tures whose very
                     helplessness endears them to those with whom they associate.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell!" said the good mother, "I must depart. I am needed elsewhere." She
                     pressed her lips again to the fair forehead of the dead; "Farewell, dear
                     child," she said, "I will meet you again. We will all meet again."</p>
                  <p>Peter raised her hand reverently to his lips, as he said, "Farewell, oh,
                     farewell! May I ever hope to see you again?"</p>
                  <p>"Bless you," my son, she answered, "heaven bless and comfort you! I know that
                     we shall meet again."</p>
                  <p>The attendant proceeded to dispose the body for burial. Leaving the jail
                     Geoffrey went to inform Mr. Cranburn, and to take the necessary steps for the
                     removal of the dead. In a few hours they accompanied to the grave all that was
                     mortal of poor Weston; "ashes to ashes, dust to dust."</p>

                  <head type="sub">INCIDENTS OF LIFE IN INDIA.</head>
                  <p>ACCORDING to promise, at the appointed hour, Geoffrey was at the office of Mr.
                     Cranburn, ready to accompany him to his home.</p>
                  <p>They at once descended to the river, where was moored the bohlio, or large
                     boat, in which Mr. Cranburn was usually rowed a few miles up the stream to his
                     residence.</p>
                  <p>This boat was fitted up with every elegance, awnings, cushions and mats, in the
                     luxurious fashion of the country.</p>
                  <p>As they glided quietly along Mr. Cranburn remarked that he feared this home of
                     his would prove rather dull quarters for one of his companion's youthful
                     spirit, "But," added he, with a deep sigh, "if the cheering of an old man's
                     lonely hours be any recompense for the sacrifice, I think I can assure you of
                     it. I have money—plenty of money—I have friends too, that I prize most
                     truly—but there is still something more that I want. As I grow older this need
                     becomes the stronger. I want these closer affections about me. You are my
                     countryman, you will find among strangers, and in a foreign land, this forms a
                     tie almost as strong and enduring as that of blood. I grow, too, to crave young
                     voices and young life near me. I would not care to join in pastimes or
                     enjoyments, my young friend, you are free to follow these. There is no
                     happiness, I am well aware without freedom, and I will not restrain you in the
                     least—but I want you to feel toward me as a son to a father. Make my home your
                     home—bring your pleasures and burdens to me, and share my sympathy. And let it
                     be freely understood, my dear boy, that should you at any time become tired, or
                     wish for change, you will find me ready to aid you, without any hard thoughts,
                     because I know in the young these feelings are natural—the desire for change,
                     the necessity of variety is a part of their very growth."</p>
                  <p>But Geoffrey, as he sat listening, had not the shadow of an unwelcome
                     anticipation in his youthful and buoyant heart. He was enjoying the present to
                     its utmost. The novelty of his position, the ease and luxury of motion, the new
                     beauties of scenery that every advancing stroke of the oar revealed, charmed
                     his imagination, lulling him to a cheerful and placid mood. The darkening
                     depths of the thickly wooded shores became more bold and prominent as they shot
                     forward in the narrowing stream: the figure of the venerable man beside him,
                     old and hoary of aspect, though strong and vigorous in mental power, became a
                     part of the picturesque and vision-like scene through which they were passing,
                     combining with the stillness and solitude, and the novel features of the
                     surrounding landscape to touch the romance of his nature; the elated
                     imagination was busy in its own region of joy, soaring afar from any anxieties
                     or troubles of life, and as Mr. Cranburn's voice ceased, his listener fell
                     still deeper into an enchanted reverie, only interrupted by the sudden stopping
                     of their boat at the broad, white steps of the landing place.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn had enjoyed his young<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5590-00000044"/>
                     friend's absorbing admiration, that exceeding sense of the exquisite which
                     cannot be expressed in words, but can only feel, and dream, and wander off in
                     unformed vapory visions. He remembered his own emotions when first viewing this
                     same beauty of scenery. He had become so accustomed to the munificent endowment
                     of nature in this tropical land, that he was gladdened by the reviving
                     influence of a new looker-on, and restored somewhat to the recollections of
                     early sensations.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said he to Geoffrey, as they ascended the steps, "your young northern
                     blood infuses something of its vigor into the insufferable lassitude which
                     creeps into the veins in this southern atmosphere. I remember how I felt when I
                     first mounted these steps, full thirty years ago. I felt in my enthusiasm as
                     though I was ascending to some unknown region of unimagined loveliness. But
                     here is our gate," he said, unlocking the high and massive entrance. They
                     entered upon a still ascending path, leading up to a broad, level table land,
                     which commanded a fine view of the ocean lying beyond. In the center of this
                     verdant spot, approached by a wide avenue, and surrounded by immense, towering
                     trees, stood the mansion of Mr. Cranburn.</p>
                  <p>It was a low building, of great extent, fronted by a colonnade of marble
                     pillars, reaching from the ground to the roof. As they entered the circular
                     court, paved with mosaic, from which the various apartments opened, a fountain,
                     throwing up its transparent jets of cooling water, welcomed them with pleasant
                     murmuring voice; beyond it, through the marble archway, could be seen the
                     garden paths winding under the fruit laden trees, and beside gorgeous beds of
                     odorous flowers.</p>
                  <p>"And this is to be my home!" exclaimed the young man to himself, as in the
                     early hours of the day he wandered alone through this labyrinth of
                     luxuriance.</p>
                  <p>That prosperity which, without apparent effort, falls in the pathway of some
                     fortunate souls, elates them often unduly; they begin to form unwarrantable
                     ideas of their own importance; to imagine that all favors are only their just
                     due, and the natural result of their superior claims. But Geoffrey was not one
                     of these self-complacent souls. Ill fortune might make him a little refractory,
                     but good fortune humbled and subdued him. He began to question his right to
                     these favors. What was he that he should be singled out for so many blessings?
                     And in the depth of his young heart that morning, he made many resolves that he
                     would endeavor to be worthy of all this, and prove his gratitude by being to
                     himself and to the world all that a good man should be.</p>
                  <p>During the day he commenced his regular employment, which was to be that of
                     English, French, and German correspondent to the firm, for which a liberal
                     salary was given. He was also to act as Mr. Cranburn's private secretary.
                     During this gentleman's long residence in India, he had accumulated a vast
                     amount of matter, with a view of preparing at some future period, a more
                     enlarged history of the country, its soil, climate, social and religious
                     peculiarities, than had yet been given to the public.</p>
                  <p>"You can help me greatly in this," said he to Geoffrey, "getting this mass of
                     material in some shape, so that I can use it."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was thus perfectly satisfied; the right stimulus had been applied; he
                     was fully occupied and independent. He wrote cheerfully to aunt Edith,
                     detailing all that he had passed through, and his present happiness and good
                     fortune.</p>
                  <p>One evening after he had been some time thus domiciled, he was tempted by the
                     bright moonlight to take a sail up the river. It was too balmy and beautiful to
                     remain indoors, and as Mr. Cranburn did not feel disposed to accompany him, he
                     started with a couple of boatman on his lonely voyage.</p>
                  <p>The late twilight still lingered faintly in the sky, blending a soft crimson
                     tinge in the effulgent splendor of the moonlight as they glided silently up the
                     river. Sometimes the boatmen, knowing thoroughly every spot of special beauty,
                     every bend and curve which enhanced with its sudden changefulness the brooding
                     luxury of quietness with which the river flowed along, would pass unexpectedly
                     into some gentle inlet, darkened by the high grounds around, and again they
                     would shoot out playfully into the center of the stream, where the flickering
                     stars and the rising moon shone on the sparkling waters, and as the eye
                     followed their distant windings, it seemed to wander out to the confines of
                     another world.</p>
                  <p>Still floating onward, they came suddenly upon a bend of the river which seemed
                     like the passage through some mountain defile, so narrow and dark was the bed
                     of the stream, so high the banks on either side, while beyond, perhaps a mile
                     or two, it expanded to a considerable breadth, and lights were dancing on its
                     borders and gay boats were passing to and fro; but this contrast only rendered
                     the darkness they were in more complete. As they passed listlessly on, close to
                     the bold shore, Geoffrey thought he heard a suppressed sound as of a moan. He
                     listened. "Stop!" he ordered the boatmen: all sat breathless. Then came
                     sweeping on the night breeze the sound of distant music. "Ah, that was it,"
                     said Geoffrey, "let us proceed."</p>
                  <p>But scarcely had their oars dipped again in the water, and the ravishing
                     strains died faintly away amid the lofty hills, when again that weary sigh came
                     distinctly to their ears: there could be no mistake now.</p>
                  <p>"Pull for the landing!" cried Geoffrey, eagerly. Presently they touched the
                     shore; but the guiding sounds were now unheard, for the rich, full tones of the
                     same grand instrument to which they had listened farther down the river, came
                     reverberating around the steep sides of this deep gorge, in splendid unbroken
                     harmony, deadening all other sound.</p>
                  <p>"I wish it would cease!" said the young man impatiently, scarcely now in a
                     condition to appreciate such inspiring tones, "where, for heaven's sake, does
                     it come from?"</p>
                  <p>He was told that the music came from the grand organ of the cathedral at
                     Serampore, on the hights above, and that there was probably some ceremony
                     taking place in the building.</p>
                  <p>The noble sounds were again dying gently away, and those in the boat were again
                     listening. Geoffrey had been peering anxiously into the dense foliage that
                     covered the face of this mountain wall, and as his eye became accustomed to the
                     darkness, he thought he perceived something like the flutter of light garments
                     struggling through the underbrush that tangled the path at its base. Surely he
                     could not be mistaken! there again! a little in advance, was that same faint,
                     wailing sigh—</p>
                  <p>"Pull in, my boys! now I have it?" he cried excitedly.</p>
                  <p>A few strokes of the oar and he leapt on land. For an instant he again caught
                     sight of the receding figure; but startled apparently by the sound of
                     approaching foot-steps, it immediately took the steep route that led
                     circuitously to the top of the high hill, and proceeded rapidly upward.</p>
                  <p>He could still, however, distinguish the heavy sighs, coming at painful
                     intervals, and with youthful inconsiderateness of results resolved at once to
                     follow. He could not take the slower path, but at once in his intense
                     eagerness—for every feeling was wrought to the highest pitch—began to spring <choice>
                        <sic>fromg</sic>
                        <corr>from</corr>
                     </choice> ledge to ledge, clambering upward with great agility. The figure was
                     now distinctly visible, but whether man or woman he could not tell. It also
                     advanced with speed, crouching and springing as if in terror. In vain he called
                     out pleasantly that he was a friend, hoping by this subterfuge to lure it
                     nearer. Still it sped on. At times by a sudden turn in the path he almost laid
                     his hand on the swift moving from, but again it was gone, and again that
                     fearful stifled gasp urged him on.</p>
                  <p>The ground as he advanced became more uneven, it was not so perpendicular;
                     there were places he could stand upon. But he had strangely lost sight of the
                     object of his pursuit; he looked around—nothing was to be seen. There were
                     lights above, and the buzz of many voices, but he listened in vain for that one
                     wailing sound. Still he proceeded—through bushes, up sloping hillocks<pb
                        n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5590-00000045"/> locks, until he reached the level
                     surface, where, clambering over a heavy stone railing, he found himself on a
                     broad road skirting the precipice he had just ascended.</p>
                  <p>The great light and glare he encountered suddenly for a moment blinded him, and
                     then he stood wonder-struck.</p>
                  <p>A great city rose before him, with its splendid square and surrounding
                     mansions, its opening streets, and its magnificent cathedral, the turrets of
                     which were all ablaze with light. Crowds were pressing forward, eager voices
                     filled the air. To the bewildered young stranger the spectacle seemed like the
                     night-creation of some potent geni.</p>
                  <p>Making inquiries of the passing crowd, he found that a wedding was to take
                     place that evening. A British officer of high rank was to be united to the
                     daughter of one of the chief dignitaries of the government. The wedding was to
                     be celebrated with much pomp in the cathedral this evening. Geoffrey caught the
                     infection of excitement from the crowd, and forgetful of his late pursuit,
                     followed in the wake of the throng who streamed toward the glittering edifice,
                     from whence issued strains of inspiring and joyous music.</p>
                  <p>The immense square was brilliantly illuminated, and filled with animated
                     groups; military men in their showy uniforms, natives in their picturesque
                     robes, private residents—the rich and the poor—mingled in the scene, while gay
                     equipages filled with richly attired people dashed through the broad and
                     lighted streets. The moon added her serene beauty to the general lustre,
                     softening the glare of the scene, and enveloping the whole in its mild,
                     subduing atmosphere of peace.</p>
                  <p>As Geoffrey reached the portico of the cathedral, the equipage of the
                     Governor-general, accompanied by numerous outriders drove up, and scarcely had
                     the party alighted when the carriages of the bridal suite came dashing
                     along.</p>
                  <p>The bride and bridegroom descended, and the bevy of attendant beauty floated
                     ethereal in gauze and tissue under the vast arches.</p>
                  <p>The young man inquired of some bystanders if strangers were admitted, and being
                     answered in the affirmative, he hurriedly ascended to the gallery, in order to
                     have a view of the splendid array of wealth and loveliness as it passed through
                     the wide doors thrown open to receive them.</p>
                  <p>As the stately train approached the high altar, the venerable bishop of the
                     diocese and several other clergymen arrayed in white robes, solemnly arose. The
                     young couple bowed their heads, and the bishop, stretching forth his hands,
                     invoked a blessing on the act about to be performed. The solemn amen, loudly
                     responded to by the attendants, faded away in the arches of those lofty aisles,
                     as again he lifted his voice, demanding if any there present had aught to say
                     why this man and this woman should not be joined in holy wedlock.</p>
                  <p>"Speak now," he said, and the impressive words chilled for an instant the glow
                     of the cathedral, "or forever after hold your peace."</p>
                  <p>Profound silence reigned for an instant; not a sound was heard in that vast
                     building, thronged from floor to gallery with human faces. Such silence, that
                     Geoffrey almost could fancy he heard the beating of those two young hearts,
                     waiting to take upon themselves the solemn vows.</p>
                  <p>The ceremony was about to proceed, when a voice—a wild, shrieking voice,
                     electrified the assembly.</p>
                  <p>"My God!" said Geoffrey, as a woman staggered forward, her garments loose, and
                     her long hair hanging disordered around her shoulders, "It is the figure I saw
                     upon the precipice!"</p>
                  <p>"Stop! stop!" she cried, with wild gestures, holding a paper high in her
                     uplifted hand. "Stop! he is my husband! Here is the proof—God knows I speak
                     truth!" and the poor creature, apparently weak and sick with excitement, fell
                     forward with a groan on the floor of the broad, marble-paved aisle.</p>
                  <p>A fearful confusion ensued. The bridegroom, turning from the altar,
                     involuntarily put his hand upon the hilt of his sword, as he vehemently
                     demanded who dared to utter this falsehood.</p>
                  <p>"My son," said the bishop, "put up your sword, this is not the way to settle
                     difficulties here."</p>
                  <p>"Then go on with the ceremony," said the young man, waving his hand
                     imperiously, as if to the whole audience. He seemed to think his word was
                     all-sufficient, and no further explanation was needed.</p>
                  <p>But that delicate flower at his side had drooped. The fair young head, all
                     wreathed in its bridal bloom, sank insensible on the strong arm of him who
                     should have been, but must cease to be a protector.</p>
                  <p>Her father now came <choice>
                        <sic>foward</sic>
                        <corr>forward</corr>
                     </choice>, stern and pale, and lifted the young girl from his supporting
                     arm.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, do not take her away!" pleaded the unfortunate bridegroom in agony. "I am
                     not such a villain,—this is some mad woman's folly! Stay but one moment, I
                     entreat."</p>
                  <p>An excited crowd had gathered round them—the white-robed group of girls, the
                     elegantly attired young men of the bridal party, the dignitaries of the place,
                     the military officials, the elite and fashion of this and neighboring
                     cities—all anxious, inquiring, and wondering; what a contrast to the smiles and
                     hilarity of a few moments before!</p>
                  <p>Some one had taken the paper from the grasp of the insensible woman, and handed
                     it to the bishop. He read it silently.</p>
                  <p>It was a certificate of marriage between the young man, Leopold Douglas, and
                     Isabella Wallace.</p>
                  <p>"We had better retire for the present," said the bishop aloud to the vast
                     audience.</p>
                  <p>To the friends he whispered low, "The ceremony cannot proceed. This matter must
                     be looked into."</p>
                  <p>The fainting girl was carried out, and gradually the crowd dispersed. Only a
                     few brother officers remained with the bewildered and stricken bridegroom,
                     still urging his innocence with incoherent impetuosity.</p>
                  <p>"It is a cruel slander!" he cried.</p>
                  <p>One of the clergymen now stept forward, he seemed to compassionate the young
                     man in his intense mortification. "You had better," he said kindly, "return
                     home for the present. In the morning we will investigate this matter
                     thoroughly."</p>
                  <p>As the young man departed with his friends he passed the prostrate form, still
                     lying uncared for on the floor of the broad aisle. He shuddered. Passing out of
                     the church portal, the tall, dignified figure of the good mother appeared
                     entering. She at once walked up to the insensible woman. The crowd now
                     descending from the galleries, gathered around with eager inquiries, "Good
                     madame," they asked, "who is she? where does she come from?"</p>
                  <p>The answer that all received, was the only one that could be given. "She is
                     unknown."</p>
                  <p>A short time since she had come to the home of Madame Duleep, very ill. She had
                     escaped from it this evening, and here she was. One after another, finding no
                     likelihood of gratifying their curiosity, left the building. Only a little
                     group remained, on whose pitying faces the still unextinguished lights glanced
                     mockingly, shining down on the inanimate form in their midst gayly as they had
                     shone upon the wedding guests, and throwing on the marble floor the shadow of
                     the good mother bending fondly over the helpless woman, and of Geoffrey,
                     lingering beside her.</p>
                  <p>"My son," she said, "how happy I am to have you here. Raise her up—let us place
                     her on one of those cushions."</p>
                  <p>He lifted her tenderly; the face, resting deathly-white upon his shoulder,
                     revealed itself from its shadowy tresses in the clear blaze of the lamps. He
                     recognised it immediately as that of the lady-passenger who had been the
                     innocent cause of the terrible tragedy on shipboard. Geoffrey could not avoid
                     an exclamation of surprise.</p>
                  <p>"Poor child!" said Madame Duleep, "she is, like yourself, a stranger from a far
                     country. Mr. Cranburn sent her to me."</p>
                  <p>The lights were now being extinguished, and the men having charge of the
                     cathedral desired them to leave. What was to be done? Where should they take
                     the poor<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5590-00000046"/> burden which had fallen
                     helpless in their hands? In her haste to seek the unfortunate girl Madame
                     Duleep had made no arrangement for meeting her attendants.</p>
                  <p>"Wait a few minutes," said Geoffrey. "My men are below, I will have them bring
                     the boat to the city ghnat, and we can easily take her to your house, good
                     mother."</p>
                  <p>Descending hastily to the river, he passed a group of men in excited
                     conversation. He judged them to be natives by their swarthy complexion, though
                     they spoke English, and wore the British uniform.</p>
                  <p>"And these are the men," said one to another, who are sent to rule us—to be our
                     leaders! The rascals!" he muttered, with a deep oath.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey soon returned, and taking the helpless cause of all this bitterness
                     gently in his arms—her wasted form making the burden comparatively light—he
                     left the cathedral, followed by the good mother.</p>
                  <p>By this time the young woman had revived to partial consciousness, but she made
                     no demonstration save now and then eagerly stretching out her hands as if in
                     search of something, falling back with a helpless sigh again, when the search
                     proved to be vain. It was doubtless the slip of paper taken from her hand in
                     the cathedral.</p>
                  <p>The mansion of Madame Duleep was about a mile distant, up the river. On
                     arriving thither the lady drew a small silver whistle from her girdle, and with
                     a few sharp and piercing notes announced her coming to those within. At the
                     signal lights and figures were seen issuing from the old, castellated edifice.
                     Through the winding pathways and under the dense foliage of the trees,
                     attendants bearing torches hastened to the water's edge. In their trusty care
                     the young woman was soon placed upon a litter and borne into the house.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey bade the good mother a kind farewell, and bidding the boatmen make
                     their utmost speed, hastened homeward, fearing that Mr. Cranburn would be
                     uneasy at his protracted absence.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">AN EPISODE IN HIGH LIFE.</head>
                  <p>ON the morrow, as might be supposed, the strange event of the preceding evening
                     was the topic of conversation in both cities and among all classes, natives as
                     well as foreigners. The interest was absorbing. The announcement having been so
                     public, added to the high position of both parties, gave the event all the
                     necessary prominence for comment and gossip.</p>
                  <p>Of course there were conjectures of all kinds among persons who knew little in
                     regard to it, and silence among those who knew more. There were rumors of all
                     kinds afloat without any real foundation; but the general opinion was that the
                     person who had caused all this trouble was on escaped lunatic, whose vagrant
                     fancy possessed with this one idea, had satisfied itself with breaking up the
                     solemn ceremony, and gratified its malignant propensity to mischief with the
                     excitement and terror ensuing. It was generally rumored also, that as soon as
                     the young lady had recovered from the shock given to her nervous system, the
                     wedding would take place again with all its former pomp.</p>
                  <p>However, public opinion is not always tempered with such moderation, and this
                     was an ugly trick, even for a lunatic.</p>
                  <p>So there were others who shook their heads dubiously. Why did the bishop so
                     promptly advise them to disperse, when he had read the crumpled slip of paper?
                     And why did not the parties come out at once with a decided explanation? They
                     owed it to the public as well as themselves to clear the matter up. If this
                     woman was a mere wandering, insane creature, attracted thither by the lights
                     and crowd, it would be very easy to prove it so.</p>
                  <p>As time wore on these unanswered queries assumed a more decided shape; one
                     circumstance after another floating up in the current of gossip, as the tide
                     throws up the impurities that have been consigned to the depths of ocean.</p>
                  <p>It was said that a duel had been fought between the brother of the young lady
                     and her intended—that the latter had been severely wounded—obliged to resign
                     his commission, and was now on his way back to England. Little was said about
                     the young lady, except that the shock had made her ill, and as soon as
                     sufficiently recovered she would accompany her brother to her native land.</p>
                  <p>All these stories, and many more went about, and perhaps, stripped of their
                     exaggerations, they were in the main correct.</p>
                  <p>A growing and general indignation began to exhibit itself against one who could
                     so cruelly deceive this amiable and interesting girl. It would be better,
                     people said, that he should keep away from the country altogether, for no one
                     could or would tolerate his presence henceforth.</p>
                  <p>Yet, though the unhappy man had sinned deeply, he had not in this case
                     intentionally erred; he was himself deceived. Considering himself, as others
                     considered him, the very soul of honor, he would not for an instant have
                     tolerated a slight or an insult given in his presence to a woman of his own
                     station. Among those we designate as the higher classes, he enjoyed the
                     reputation of a chivalrous devotion to the other sex. Mothers would have
                     trusted their dearest treasures to his keeping, and fathers have deemed
                     themselves perfectly secure in his integrity. But unfortunately the young man's
                     principles of honor did not reach far enough; like too many, he had his line of
                     distinction—making a vast gulf between his estimate of gentle and plebeian
                     blood. In his idea the one was elevated above the very thought of wrong, while
                     the other was unconsciously degraded to the level of his most debased
                     passions.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn had been unceasing in his interest for the unfortunate stranger;
                     she was perhaps too much overlooked by the multitude in their sympathy with the
                     more prominent sufferer, but in Mr. Cranburn's kindly heart the neglected and
                     the oppressed held ever the first consideration.</p>
                  <p>Little could be gathered from the incoherent ravings of the sick woman, but he
                     had discovered where her friends were to be found, and from them had received a
                     full account of the circumstances which led to so deplorable a result.</p>
                  <p>The story was this:</p>
                  <p>In a thriving town in England, the name of which I withhold, as it is of little
                     importance, there lived a respectable trades-man and his wife, who in the
                     course of many years of steady, frugal industry and unremitting perseverance,
                     had attained to what in their simple desires was quite a competence. The wife
                     had attended the shop, while her husband manufactured the wares, and so
                     excellent was he in his humble calling, and so upright and honest were the
                     worthy couple in all their dealings, that not only the townsfolk, but all the
                     country round patronised them, and were disposed to think that whatever was
                     purchased at their little shop was better than could be obtained elsewhere.
                     They were indeed a fortunate and prosperous pair, for to add to their other
                     possessions, heaven had blessed them with two beautiful and intelligent
                     daughters.</p>
                  <p>In the bringing up of these girls, perhaps the good people showed their first
                     touch of weakness—at least their neighbors and friends thought so; but they do
                     not always know, and it generally after the turning up of misfortune that we
                     hear the wise sayings and predictions that such must happen. At any rate these
                     parents did their best. They loved their children beyond everything, and they
                     could not bear that these gentle, bright, and delicate little ones should have
                     the hard struggle in life which they themselves had endured, struggling up
                     through ignorance and poverty, and feeling instinctively, after all, having
                     attained the means of comfort and elevation, that they had not the full
                     capacity to enjoy them. So they resolved that these fine girls—and fine girls
                     they were, even apart from parental partiality—should eschew the hard labor
                     they had known, should be instructed and polished, and become the fine women
                     they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>So they were schooled accordingly: and<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5590-00000047"/>
                     in the process of education acquired tastes and habits far above those with
                     whom they associated. Had they been boys they might have broken loose from
                     these fixed usages and surroundings—gone out into the world, made for
                     themselves a place, and risen to a higher level. Not being boys—as their
                     neighbors and friends again sagely observed—what were they good for? They were
                     spoiled for decent mechanics' wives. They might be governesses—but the gentry
                     did not want tradesmen's daughters—and they were too handsome. The gentry
                     wanted decayed gentlewomen to teach their children, the daughters of broken
                     down merchants, professional men, or the like, and so they were afflicted with
                     sympathising fears: and when sad times did come, oh! they knew it! It was all
                     that false education—the girls were spoiled, and they knew it would be so.</p>
                  <p>But the father and the mother died just as their buds were blossoming into
                     woman-hood, leaving them all they possessed. It was a nice little property, and
                     with careful economy would have afforded an humble livelihood. But the girls
                     were proud, and perhaps swayed by a little vanity; they could not bear to spend
                     their days quietly and idly in the uncongenial society of their equals. They
                     were ambitious, they wanted to be known—to be where they could make their mark
                     in the world. It may be they were imprudent—at any rate they were unfortunate,
                     even in their youth and beauty, having no judicious friend on whom to rely for
                     protection. Sincere, high minded, and pure in their desires, they did not
                     estimate the difficulties of their position.</p>
                  <p>In the large and fashionable town where they had spent their school days, their
                     attention was often drawn by the elegant shops, attended by richly dressed
                     women, where all the little elegancies of stylish life were dispensed;
                     cosmetics, perfumes, toilet nicknacks, laces, embroideries, gloves, and all the
                     innumerable nameless things that help to spend the wealth of the wealthy, and
                     kill the time of the idle. They had often thought in those days it would be the
                     hight of happiness to be employed in such a place. And now the bold thought
                     occurred to them, could they not create such an establishment in their own
                     town?</p>
                  <p>At first they were almost frightened at their own daring, but the thought
                     constantly recurred until they became accustomed to its consideration. It was
                     certainly feasible. They had naturally a business tact and ability, and so,
                     before many months their dream was actually realized; they were at the head of
                     such a delightful establishment, and their whole fortune was put in the
                     venture.</p>
                  <p>What a contrast did their showy and elegant establishment present to the dingy
                     little shop where their father and mother had pursued their humble thrift.
                     Plate glass windows, rosewood cases, high ceilings, painted walls, and marble
                     counters, presented the very ideality of shop-keeping, and made it almost
                     aristocratic. The brilliant goods were selected and arranged with care. An
                     artistic eye had guided the combinations of color, the minute details which
                     resulted in the pleasing effect of the whole; all was lightness, grace and
                     beauty. And the two elegant girls, so earnest in pursuing their vocation,
                     apparently unconscious of their own extraordinary attractions, presided like
                     goddesses over an enchanted realm.</p>
                  <p>Letitia, the eldest of the sisters, was of most majestic style of beauty,—had
                     she been of noble or royal birth, we would name it queenly. Her features were
                     regular and haughty, her complexion fair and brilliant, and with that natural
                     diadem of rich brown hair, she looked a very queen, to be bowed before as the
                     dispenser rather than the solicitor of fortune's favors.</p>
                  <p>Isabel was slighter, darker, but some thought equally beautiful, and more
                     pliant and fascinating.</p>
                  <p>The young women commenced their business under the most favorable auspices;
                     people generally were pleased to have so fine an establishment in their own
                     town, and pleased, too, that it should be so ably conducted by those they could
                     claim as their own <foreign xml:lang="FRA">proteges.</foreign> The shop was
                     crowded with purchasers, and even the rich gentry try of the neighborhood
                     favored them with a call. Quite a buzz arose about their beauty; many came for
                     the express purpose of looking at them. In the excitement of their agreeable
                     employment, where they seemed to have just found their appropriate place, and
                     in the buoyancy and hopefulness of their youthful spirits, their attractions
                     increased.</p>
                  <p>The story of their beauty and sprightliness reached the ears of all, far and
                     near. Gradually the establishment became the resort of military men, whose
                     regiments were quartered in the vicinity; young officers, idle and
                     pleasure-loving, found it very agreeable to while away an hour or two in such
                     pleasant company, paying for their gratification in generous purchases of
                     costliest gloves and elegant trifles.</p>
                  <p>Among others, two more elderly and sedate than the rest, lieutenant-colonel
                     Potifer and Major Douglas, were lured by the common curiosity to take a peep at
                     the famous beauties. It would do them no harm to drive over and do a little
                     shopping with the divinities.</p>
                  <p>They took the drive, and did the shopping, and were astonished to find
                     themselves as much interested in making innumerable purchases thereafter, as
                     the gay young fellows about them.</p>
                  <p>We will not prolong the sad sequel. It is a tale too often told, of selfishness
                     on one side and confiding weakness on the other. The young girls were truly
                     refined and pure; it was out of the question to win them by unlawful means; but
                     they had to deal with men who, when their passions were roused, were incapable
                     of considering anything that stood in the way of their gratification. Female
                     virtue, with them, in certain stations of life, was a mere will-o'-the-wisp.
                     These men talked of love; they excited the sympathies of these young and
                     inexperienced women; they roused the feeling of self-devotion so common in the
                     sex; they spoke of happiness forever sacrificed if love were denied them.
                     Sacrifice! it was a word without meaning as applied to these sensual and
                     self-indulgent men, but they could sacrifice what was not their own without a
                     scruple. To the accomplishment of <emph>that</emph> sacrifice they could devote
                     whole weeks and months—and for what? To gratify the unworthy passion of an
                     hour—to amuse and give piquancy to vacant moments.</p>
                  <p>The girls were flattered by the devotion of those so vastly their superiors in
                     the social scale, and also undoubtedly loved the men who could for their sakes
                     apparently disregard the differences of station and the considerations of
                     wealth. They were so far led astray by these influences as to consent to a
                     private marriage, which was to be kept strictly secret for the present.</p>
                  <p>Soon after the ceremony of this double wedding took place, the regiment was
                     ordered off to India, and the officers left their wives, with the promise that
                     on their return the marriage should be made public. Months passed in that
                     agonising suspense endured when those we love are absent. No letters came,
                     though the sisters wrote repeatedly. Letitia, the wife of colonel Potifer, was
                     in a situation which would soon expose her to painful comment; she wrote to her
                     husband in great distress; self-respect demanded that the promised explanation
                     should be no longer delayed. Then came an answer at last. Too late these
                     trusting women learned the cruel deceit practised upon them. The marriages were
                     a mockery. Licenses had been procured, and the ceremony performed by the
                     confidential servant of one of the officers. In extenuation these men dared to
                     urge their great love; and asserted that only respect for the feelings of their
                     families as eldest sons had prevented the honorable union they would otherwise
                     have desired. Propriety forbade them to marry so far beneath their station.</p>
                  <p>Thus propriety remained intact; and if truth and manhood suffered indignity, no
                     one knew it, and it did not matter.</p>
                  <p>So these unfortunate women awoke to a terrible sense of all that had befallen
                     them They had avoided friends and relatives, and borne the obloquy of
                     suspicion, all for these cruel men who could throw them off as lightly as they
                     could change their garments<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5590-00000048"/> ments.
                     Poor women! With all their pride they could not endure the sly inuendoes, the
                     looks of compassion, the inspection of curious or kindly eyes; they sold out <choice>
                        <sic>their their</sic>
                        <corr>their</corr>
                     </choice> splendid establishment at a great sacrifice, which left them a bare
                     sufficiency for the necessities of life, and sought in an obscure and distant
                     village to hide their disgrace and their wrongs.</p>
                  <p>Isabel had felt more than her sister the spirit of resistance, and had
                     struggled hard with that heavy burden of wrong. She wanted to act; her impulses
                     would have led her to seek redress, to punish the offenders. "But why do this?"
                     the calmer mind of her sister suggested. "We shall but expose ourselves to
                     renewed contempt. The world is not ready yet to be just in these matters. It
                     would not allow us a fitting place before, it will not permit us in the future
                     to rise superior to our calamities. So, I will keep quiet and labor along in
                     some humble calling, unknown. I cannot bear contemptuous pity. And Isabel," she
                     said with bitter emphasis, "we cannot but know it—we have the curse of beauty.
                     A curse it is, and has been to us! It has exposed us to the insults of the
                     designing and the base, and it will never assist us to right the wrong—let us
                     bear our fate."</p>
                  <p>In the lapse of a few years the intelligence accidentally reached them that
                     Isabel's husband would shortly lead to the altar a young lady of fortune,
                     residing in India.</p>
                  <p>This rumor roused the young girl to a most painful excitement. Her naturally
                     active mind was wrought up to the highest intensity of thought. She pondered by
                     day and night the absorbing question—could she not do something to avert this
                     disgrace, or to avenge the deed on the head of its perpetrator? Clear thoughts
                     are sometimes born of the most darkly chaotic states of feeling; it was so in
                     this case. Unknown to her sister, Isabel conveyed the two marriage certificates
                     to an eminent solicitor, and explained the matter to him.</p>
                  <p>He examined them carefully, and to her amazement pronounced the certificate of
                     her marriage legal; her sister's was a forgery. Isabel was a legal wife. When
                     convinced of this fact, she determined at once by some means to reach her
                     husband, and prevent the perpetration of his second marriage. Her sister tried
                     to dissuade her; the object could as well be effected by writing, or through
                     the agency of another.</p>
                  <p>No: she would go in person, and that without delay. The preparation for this
                     journey exhausted what was left of their wasted patrimony. The last of their
                     little property was sold—and the eventful voyage took place.</p>
                  <p>On arriving in India, Isabel learned that her husband was absent with his
                     regiment in a distant part of the country: but they were under marching orders,
                     and might be expected to return any day. She waited with sickening impatience.
                     Anxious to preserve her husband's character, and to do him no injury, she was
                     very cautious in her inquiries, and as she had, of course, no opportunity of
                     going into general society, she could ascertain nothing in regard to the
                     approaching marriage. She could only wait in vague uncertainty. Oh, that
                     soul-sickening anxiety of suspense! There was a terrible burning pain in her
                     head every day, and a feverish restlessness possessed her.</p>
                  <p>The advice which she received from Mr. Cranburn, to retire to the home of
                     Madame Duleep, came just in time. The adventurous spirit gave way at last, and
                     she was prostrated with a violent fever, lying for a long time hovering between
                     life and death. On the afternoon preceding the grand expected bridal in the
                     cathedral, the invalid, apparently asleep upon her couch, heard in her
                     half-unconscious state, the nurses whispering over the matter—the
                     illuminations—the splendor—the bridegroom and the bride. In a moment all her
                     faculties were alert; she listened and heard much. Rousing herself, she
                     artfully put a few questions, and quietly gathered all the information she
                     desired without exciting suspicion. Her eye was bright, her face composed,
                     though somewhat flushed. The attendants wondered at the change which had taken
                     place in her; they thought it must be some unlooked for crisis in the disease;
                     not comprehending that this was the power of a highly excited mind operating
                     upon the physical system, and causing it to rally as at an electric shock. She
                     heard everything that they said with singular distinctness, and seemed
                     instinctively to comprehend times and places, and laid her plans accordingly
                     with promptness and decision. All nerve and action, she felt but the one
                     imperative necessity, thought only the one absorbing thought. Well aware that
                     she would not be allowed to leave her bed if it were known, she determined
                     silently to escape.</p>
                  <p>Still and watchful she lay, the coming event ever before her, the place she
                     wished to reach—the great cathedral on the hights above—ever present in her
                     thoughts. She felt that she had strength to go there that moment—how long
                     seemed the time of waiting! Her brain was all astir, throbbing, throbbing. It
                     was late before the opportunity came. At length the nurse was called to the
                     evening meal in the large hall adjoining; assuring herself that her patient
                     slumbered quietly, she turned the key in the lock and left the room. When she
                     returned the room was empty. Isabel had escaped by the window, lowering herself
                     by a cord to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The rest we know: when Madame Duleep returned that evening from one of her
                     visits of mercy, she found the house in commotion. To her inquiries the nurse
                     answered by relating the apparent change for the better—the interest manifested
                     by the invalid in the gossip about the wedding—and her seemingly deep slumber
                     afterward. Madame Duleep immediately resolved to hasten to the cathedral, where
                     she opportunely arrived just as the unfortunate object of her search fell faint
                     and helpless to the floor, amid the excited crowd.</p>
                  <p>After the invalid was restored to the fostering care of the good mother it was
                     many weeks before she evidenced the slightest consciousness. Let me now give
                     the sad finale of this sad story. It is a true one.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate Isabel never did entirely recover her reason. Harmless and
                     imbecile, she was returned to her sister. But that sister was laboring under
                     fatal disease and sunk in hopeless poverty. Their all was gone—sickness, and
                     inability to obtain employment had devoured the very last of their means—and
                     the stately, the elegant Letitia ended her days in that last shelter of
                     indigence and humiliation,—the alms-house, while Isabel was removed to the
                     insane asylum belonging to the same establishment. There after a short time she
                     also died.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps some may say that this was but retributive justice; that these women
                     should have been content to remain where their parents had placed them; that
                     they were proud, and carried away by the <choice>
                        <sic>vanties</sic>
                        <corr>vanities</corr>
                     </choice> of this world, and that it was in mercy they were visited with so
                     severe chastisement. This theory might be admitted it we could see its
                     universal application; but while the wicked flourish in all their pride and
                     self-sufficiency, and no evil overtakes them, we cannot but question its
                     truth.</p>
                  <p>The officers on their return to England were received again, with
                     congratulations, into the society which they had left. If a rumor of the
                     offence they had committed ever reached that society, it was regarded only as
                     some youthful folly, to be lightly remembered, and speedily forgiven. And so
                     pernicious are the false views in which we are sometimes reared, that it is
                     doubtful, even, whether these men ever realized the enormity of their crime.
                     Probably the longest retained and most poignant sting which Major Douglass
                     suffered, and the matter that was really most damaging to his reputation, was
                     the disappointment and public exposure of the young lady with whom he was to
                     have been united. The terrible cause was forgotten in the painful effect.
                     Society might overlook in her distinguished sons—distinguished by birth-right
                     and soldierly daring—any slight abberration which only affected the morals and
                     welfare of those below their level, but it could not be thus lenient with an
                     attempt involving the disarrangement of that reproachless superstructure—its
                     aristocracy. Major Douglass had tampered with one of<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000049"/> society's recognised darlings—it had been done

                  <head type="sub">GLIMPSES OF HOME.</head>
                  <p>LET us pass rapidly over a period of five years. Few events of importance had
                     occurred to the actors in my tale during this period. In the history of
                     individuals as well as nations, long intervals may elapse of comparative
                     uniformity, each day and year only marked by the impression of the last, while
                     again in a few weeks or months may be compressed great struggles, vital
                     interests, important changes, influencing the destinies of ages and
                     generations. So with our friends, five years had glided on in a monotonous but
                     happy quiet. Their calm was to be followed by a quick succession of events
                     whose rapid passage obliterated the remembrance of former quiet.</p>
                  <p>Although peace reigned in their eastern home, surrounded with all the
                     magnificence and abundance of nature, and embellished with every luxury and
                     comfort, yet afar off there was no peace in the land; a terrible internal war
                     raged, whose foundations and beginnings were in outrage and wrong. Then the
                     Hastings and Dalhouses and a host of others, unscrupulous, self-seeking, greedy
                     for power, flourished in their might, and the spirit of retaliation, roused in
                     the people, urged them to vengeance equally unscrupulous, equally
                     unreasonable.</p>
                  <p>Thus wrong produces wrong—and who shall say whether the cause or the effect is
                     deepest in sin? Innocent children were cruelly murdered; defenceless delicate
                     women remorselessly destroyed by the native Sepoys. It was harrowing to listen
                     to the recitals constantly afloat. The movement of troops, the thronging of
                     multitudes for protection to the Anglo Indian cities, kept up an universal
                     excitement, but further than this, their quiet in Mr. Cranburn's secluded
                     residence, and in his busy and prosperous warehouses, was not disturbed.</p>
                  <p>During these five years Geoffrey had been kept well posted as to all that was
                     transpiring in his native home. Aunt Edith was a regular monthly
                     correspondent.</p>
                  <p>As might be expected, Ralph and Madeleine were married. The marriage took place
                     not many months after he left. This he had looked for; "Aunt Dupont would
                     always carry her way," he whispered to himself as a sort of sedative. Still he
                     could not altogether quiet a little twinge of jealousy against Madeleine at her
                     precipitance.</p>
                  <p>"She might at least have paid the respect to my memory as it were—to have
                     waited at any rate a year. But it is just as I have always heard about these
                     women; you cannot make a lasting impression,—out of sight out of mind." But on
                     further reflection he was a little mollified toward the sex; he remembered that
                     his own fancy had wandered; that he had never given Madeleine any particular
                     reason to remember him; that she was almost justified in promptly showing that
                     she could forget.</p>
                  <p>And then there was aunt Edith, a host in herself, to vindicate women from such
                     a sweeping denunciation. Ah! these good mothers, and aunts, and sisters, they
                     are the salt that saves! Many a weak man lured to ruin and dishonor by the
                     wiles of a wicked woman, has been rescued from his vengeful hatred of the whole
                     sex, by the remembrance of his mother, long suffering, loving and kind, or of a
                     sister, innocence nocent, pure and true, who loved him for himself alone.</p>
                  <p>So, through the benign influence of aunt Edith, Geoffrey began to feel quite
                     complacent, and to experience the old softness and tenderness toward the whole
                     of womanhood, Madeleine included. He began to think she had done all right, and
                     that his love, if such it might be called, was only the effect of Ralph's
                     rivalry; and now it was all over he felt like writing a long letter of
                     congratulation.</p>
                  <p>Ralph, he was told, had sold the old house and grounds; and on the old garden
                     was being erected a church of magnificent dimensions. He had removed farther up
                     town—kept a splendid establishment—carriages and liveried servants—with all the
                     accompaniments of wealth, aristocracy and etiquette befitting the heir of the
                     great Luperthorp estate. Mrs. Dupont was with her son.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith had bought a little cottage just out of the city: "Quiet and
                     secluded," she wrote, "wholly embowered in willows. We call it 'Willow Grove.'
                     You will inquire perhaps, who are 'we.' Ah! you can hardly imagine the two
                     lovely girls I have beside me; my bower is adorned with their living bloom.
                     They are my clouds and sunshine, my care and my joy. But I will write you more
                     of them hereafter. I forgot to tell you that we had made a sort of division of
                     the old family retainers. Part of them preferred to remain with me. The
                     coachman, groom, and old cook are with Ralph, while Thomas the butler, and his
                     wife Nattie, are at the cottage. They and their stout young granddaughter are
                     all the help I need. And Thomas, although very old, attends faithfully to my
                     little garden, and keeps it a pattern of thriftiness."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn had made many unavailing efforts to have Peter Ackley at once sent
                     back to New York for trial. Although the unfortunate man had no hope, and
                     apparently no wish to escape the utmost penalty of the law, yet he was desirous
                     to have the matter over, and to know his fate. Two or three months, however, he
                     lay in his solitary cell, before the proper steps were taken for his
                     return.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey still continued to pay him all the attention his position allowed, and
                     fierce and ungovernable as Pete might be by nature, he was very much softened
                     latterly. He wept bitterly when parting from Geoffrey and Mr. Cranburn.</p>
                  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "had I met you ten years ago I might not now be in these
                     humiliating circumstances. I would have found there were some to esteem and
                     honor, and it might have saved me."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey wrote home to his aunt Edith, requesting her to show all the kindness
                     in her power to his late shipmate, and also to procure for him the legal
                     services of Mr. Bernott. The circumstances of Pete's connection with Leil the
                     beggar-girl, were also confided to her, and she was urged, if possible, to
                     bring the father and daughter together.</p>
                  <p>No punishment, of course, was meted out to the first mate. This man, who went
                     through life as a destroying moral force, a blight upon all good and generous
                     emotions, confusing right with wrong in one chaos of debasing passion, and
                     impelling to evil whoever came under his influence, met no apparent suffering
                     and little inconvenience from the effects of his misdeeds. Ill temper and
                     ungovernable passion are not in themselves punishable crimes, neither does the
                     world visit these with serious disapprobation: it has no time to discriminate:
                     "He is a fine fellow,—but a little hasty, and sometimes a little sulky. He
                     makes the fire fly, though, and you must stand round when he's in the mood,—but
                     in the main he means well—it's only temper!" Such remarks are often made by
                     those who do not come daily and hourly under its exactions. There is no account
                     taken of the bitter spirit fanned to life, of the timid natures crushed, of the
                     strong souls turned aside from usefulness, of human liberties outraged—oh, it
                     is only temper! What if those under the authority of this man were driven to
                     hatred and revenge until these became the ruling motives of action? He was a
                     fine seaman, ever wide awake to his<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5590-00000050"/>
                     employer's interests—and it was only temper! He never cursed or browbeat
                     another beyond the point of the law—he never by an added stroke of the rope
                     outraged the law's decrees—and his thorough seamanship should be rewarded. Mr.
                     Cranburn was obliged to allow him to retain command.</p>
                  <p>"I am but third owner," said that gentleman to Geoffrey, with whom he conferred
                     on all matters of business, "and he has the New York owners' written statement,
                     and one from our late captain, that he is to have command the first vacancy
                     occurring on our line of ships. He has chosen Simpson as his first mate, so you
                     see they are both retained in power. I was at first disposed to dispute this,
                     but on reflection concluded that perhaps it would be better to leave it as it
                     is. They would soon find other places in which to exercise more dangerously
                     their savage ferocity and love of power. Retaliation is sometimes sweet, but it
                     is not always best to act upon it. If the object is to make people better,
                     returning like for like will not always do it. There are differences of
                     disposition; some natures need punishment to bring them to feeling; others,
                     touch their generous emotions, be lenient, forgiving, and they are at once
                     subdued. It would not do to treat both these natures alike. In return for
                     allowing these men to retain their positions, they have submitted to certain
                     restrictions that will compel them to rule more leniently. Simpson is much
                     subdued; I think he is heartily ashamed of his share in the recent trouble. He
                     is a young man of good capacity, and perhaps the late serious results of his
                     malevolence may lead to reflections that will make him a wiser and a better
                     man. Old Jacob still remains with them—he has a most singular attachment for
                     the new captain—I cannot understand it."</p>
                  <p>"I can, partly," said Geoffrey, "the old man is all alone in the world—and the
                     mate, harsh and tyrannical as he is, has not been especially so to him. He
                     needs some one to attach himself to—and his kind heart has an odd sort of pity
                     for one so universally hated,—as other kind hearts are attracted to those who
                     are diseased and deserted. There is a kind of magnanimity in his devotion.
                     'I'll stand by him as long as these old bones last! He may need me yet—mad,
                     thoughtless fellow! This between you and me,' the old sailor has often
                     whispered confidentially."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn and Geoffrey had lived much alone during these years, and though
                     the young man often missed the happy female influence to which he had been
                     accustomed, yet his attachment for Mr. Cranburn partly supplied the
                     deficiency.</p>
                  <p>He had become acquainted with some of the resident English families, but this
                     intercourse was merely formal and occasional. In fact but little other
                     intercourse was possible; the nature of the climate, the changeful, military
                     character of the population, (but few, even of civilians, intending to make the
                     country a permanent residence) rendering home-like comfort and association, as
                     well as the presence and refining influences of woman very rare in these
                     Anglo-Indian cities.</p>
                  <p>So the great event of their lives, during this time, was the arrival of letters
                     from home. To Mr. Cranburn these epistles became almost equally objects of
                     interest as to his young friend. He usually read them all, and became through
                     Geoffrey's descriptions fully acquainted with the characters of those who wrote
                     them. Ralph occasionally sent a few lines in his brief <choice>
                        <sic>fashon</sic>
                        <corr>fashion</corr>
                     </choice>, and Madeleine cheered them now and then with those charming little
                     notes, full of life, gossip and current news, racy, spicy and vivacious, for
                     which graceful and charming women of society are so famous.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was the steady permanent writer: always the same, enduring in her
                     affections, and solicitous for the welfare of those she loved. She had much to
                     tell him about all she was doing with that yearly income left by his father,
                     which he had transferred to her, on leaving home. "I have sacredly," she wrote,
                     "devoted it to charitable objects, and some day when we meet again, I will tell
                     you all the blessing it has been.</p>
                  <p>"And will you ever be with me again, my dear boy? My heart is lonely without
                     you. Much as it may possess of all that is lovely and loveable, there is still
                     that want. But" and a wail broke through the cheerful letter, as if from the
                     heart's innermost core, "oh, I have need of suffering! It is only just that I
                     should suffer!"</p>
                  <p>"You might suppose, sir," said Geoffrey to Mr. Cranburn, "that my aunt Edith
                     had committed some great sin in the course of her life, so martyr like does she
                     bear chastisement; but sir, she is one of the best women that breathes. I can
                     hardly conceive that even in thought she should be an instant wrong: but from
                     my earliest childhood I remember there seemed always some mystery about aunt
                     Edith which I could not unravel, some strange cloud of suffering and depression
                     beyond the reach of my sympathies or consolation."</p>

                  <p>BUT time, though unmarked by any stirring event, had glided on swiftly enough
                     with our bachelor recluses in their far off Indian home.</p>
                  <p>These five years had to Geoffrey been laden with peace and contentment; every
                     want supplied; every desire indulged; he had been treated with affection and
                     consideration, and thus a proper respect for his own powers had been fostered,
                     which grew with his mental growth, developing in him a true spirit of
                     independence and manliness. They had been a good school for him, with a most
                     judicious teacher; and thrown on his own resources among strangers, he had
                     grown strong and self-reliant. Yet though Geoffrey was well aware of this,
                     still he could not conquer a secret craving and desire toward that other home,
                     which as years sped on became more intense and absorbing.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn had remunerated him most liberally for his services, and as his
                     expenses were light, he had been able to lay by during these few years quite a
                     nice little sum, at least it seemed such to his modest expectations. He would
                     soon have enough, perhaps in a year or two, to enable him to make a visit home.
                     Home! towards its beacon light speeds the most wandering fancy,—the most truant
                     thought,—to its steady luster attracted surely, after years of absence, it may
                     be of forgetfulness.</p>
                  <p>The letters of aunt Edith, especially, kept these home feelings with Geoffrey
                     ever present. They were so real he seemed to be there. She still trusted and
                     prayed that he would sometime return. That home was now so attractive—rendered
                     so by the presence of the young lives that adorned it. How much she had to tell
                     him about these two Cecilias. "The Cecilias," as she loved to call them, how
                     they illuminated and glanced through every page she wrote, in all these months
                     and years, becoming ideally a joy to the young man, because they were really a
                     joy to her.</p>
                  <p>He was most desirous to have a full description of their minds and persons.
                     This aunt Edith would not give. "You will be falling in love with one or the
                     other," she said gaily, "and that will not do. You are to love them alike."</p>
                  <p>When he still insisted on having something upon which to base his fancy sketch,
                     aunt Edith vouchsafed to inform him that one was tall and fair, the other short
                     and dark. "My Morning and Night, I sometimes call them, my blonde and brunette.
                     But do not let your fancy run away with your judgment, and paint your ideals in
                     the gold and azure of morning tints, or the rich purple darkness of evening
                     hues; they are mortals, and as such must be viewed. But think of them as
                     everything good, noble and true. They know all about you, they have gleaned
                     from me every fact, every fault, as truly as every virtue, and from all I have
                     said they have gathered so life-like a picture, that transferred to canvas I
                     almost have you here with me. Yes, Geoffrey, one of my adopted daughters has
                     sketched your portrait, and a most perfect likeness it is."</p>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5590-00000051"/>
                  <p>Again his aunt Edith described to him in charming detail all they were doing in
                     preparation for this joyful sometime coming home. She had built an addition to
                     the cottage, a circular wing, "and my girls, have named it 'Geoffrey's Tower,'"
                     said she, "we take great pleasure in fitting it up as the absent one would like
                     it, for it is to be devoted entirely to him. We have a sweet running spring at
                     the foot of our little garden, and over it a rustic summer-house, covered with
                     flourishing vines, and this is also dedicated to our wanderer, and is called
                     'Geoffrey's Spring,' so you see your name is quite a household word."</p>
                  <p>But after a time aunt Edith's letters assumed a more melancholy tone: she wrote
                     oftener, fearing, as she said, that she might not have that privilege long—her
                     health was failing. Though with her usual hopefulness she bade him not to be
                     alarmed, as although she might pass through a time of prostration and severe
                     illness, she had no doubt of ultimate recovery.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was indeed most painfully excited, and Mr. Cranburn shared his
                     uneasiness. The young man knew that his aunt was not one to be easily alarmed,
                     or to arouse the alarm of others, especially in regard to herself. He began to
                     have serious thoughts of returning home at once. But the duty he owed to Mr.
                     Cranburn restrained him.</p>
                  <p>Another letter came, and this time aunt Edith spoke more freely.</p>
                  <p>"I must tell you all, my dear boy," said she, "it is right that I should—you
                     must be prepared for the worst. There is fatal disease in my system. I am ready
                     to go, although I have long held up against it, hoping, dear child, that I
                     might see your face once more ere I depart. But I do not deserve to,
                     Geoffrey—and I am weary of life—my conscience will not let me rest. Geoffrey,
                     you were always so trusting that I had not the heart to shake your faith in me,
                     and reveal myself to you as I am, as I have been—heartless and selfish, cruelly
                     selfish. But neither yet can I tell you all. I still cling to the desire that
                     when I am gone aunt Edith may be to you in memory the aunt Edith you have known
                     in life. Yet, my child, I have a secret sorrow, a deep sense of guilt, which I
                     cannot carry unspoken out of the world. In my youth I wronged deeply one whom I
                     loved; I did not know how much I loved him until he was gone. He is, no doubt,
                     dead: and my heart-cry, the ever yearning desire of my soul is to be with
                     him."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had read thus far when his feelings overcame him, and he gave way to a
                     paroxysm of despair, weeping bitterly aloud. Just then Mr. Cranburn entered the
                     room. Geoffrey could not speak in answer to his anxious inquiry what was the
                     matter, but silently handed him the open letter. Mr. Cranburn retired to his
                     own apartment to read it, not wishing to intrude upon the young man's grief. As
                     he closed the door a light breeze lifted the papers upon the table, and
                     Geoffrey's eye caught sight of a letter lying unobserved hitherto among the
                     various packages received that morning from town. Another letter with the long
                     familiar postmarks of home.</p>
                  <p>Hastily opening it, he found a brief note, signed "Ilia."</p>
                  <p>"I have sent this," said the writer, "unknown to aunt Edith. We are so unhappy
                     in regard to her illness that Cecilia entreated me to write you. We beg you to
                     return home. It is perhaps a daring request—but your presence may save the life
                     of our dear adopted mother. The physicians have assured us that if she would
                     submit to an operation it would remove the painful disease under which she
                     labors—they have scarcely a doubt of it. But she cannot be persuaded; to all
                     our prayers she answers with unvarying determination, 'No, it cannot be.'
                     Indeed she seems rather to wish for death. So, if it be possible, return at
                     once. Her disease has not arrived at that crisis which threatens immediate
                     danger—she may linger a year—not longer; there is no hope of her ultimate
                     recovery, unless by your return—I feel assured that she will live till then—a
                     new life is aroused in her, and you prevail, as we cannot. The doctors say that
                     the operation may be delayed layed some months without injuring its probable
                     success."</p>
                  <p>This letter was a joyful relief to Geoffrey. He sprang to his feet to hasten to
                     Mr. Cranburn and tell him the joyful hope. Stepping outside the door he was
                     startled by a wild outcry, and the running to and fro of attendants in wild
                     disorder. He inquired hastily what was the cause of their excitement, and
                     received the answer in broken words and terrified gestures, that the master was
                     dead or dying—he had fallen in a fit. Running breathlessly to the apartment
                     whither all the eager steps were tending, Geoffrey found Mr. Cranburn lying
                     prostrate upon the floor, insensible—he might indeed be dead. The letter he had
                     been reading lay open upon the table. He had fallen from his chair, and the
                     sound had alarmed some one near, who hastening to the spot found him thus.</p>
                  <p>The loud outcries and lamentations of the numerous servitors and dependants of
                     the household attested their anxiety for their beloved master. But Geoffrey
                     persuaded them to retire; all save one, a native servant who had long been the
                     personal attendant of Mr. Cranburn. With the assistance of this man he lifted
                     the insensible form and placed it upon a couch. No physician was at hand; the
                     first and only thing that could be done was performed with self-possessed
                     promptness by the native, who was in his way somewhat of a student of medicine.
                     He opened a vein in the arm of his master. Presently a slight groan bespoke
                     returning consciousness, he opened his eyes and looked at Geoffrey as if to ask
                     what it all meant.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey begged him to lie quiet a while, till danger was past. A heavy sigh
                     was the only response—a weary and heavy sigh, and he closed his eyes again.</p>
                  <p>Drawing the light gauze curtains, Geoffrey sat down by the bedside. He sat
                     thus, occasionally looking at the invalid, until far into the night.</p>
                  <p>Towards midnight Mr. Cranburn roused, and turning to Geoffrey requested him to
                     retire. "You need not be afraid to leave me, my dear boy," he said, with the
                     kindly and fatherly attention which he ever manifested toward this youth whom
                     he cherished as a son, "No, you need not feel the least alarm—I am a great deal
                     better. And do not send any one else to sit with me, I much prefer to be
                     alone."</p>
                  <p>To the young man's great astonishment when he descended to breakfast the next
                     morning, he found Mr. Cranburn sitting at the table. He was pale—almost ghastly
                     pale, and there was a tremor about his person that showed great weakness. He
                     tried to speak as the young man came in, but the words failed to come forth.
                     Geoffrey took his hand and pressed it silently, and then sat down to their
                     silent meal. Mr. Cranburn did not eat, he drank a little iced milk, and
                     listlessly turned over the morning papers—they seemed to possess no interest
                     for him, and one by one he threw them aside.</p>
                  <p>When the attendants had removed the scarcely tasted breakfast, and retired from
                     the room, Mr. Cranburn made a strong effort to conquer his agitation, as he
                     said, "I would wish to explain, Geoffrey, but I am weak. I thought to have
                     outlived this—but that letter," and again his voice choked with emotion, "that
                     letter,"—he could say no more, but throwing his arms across the table, laid
                     down his head, and a burst of tears, such as perhaps only once in a life time a
                     man may shed, came welling forth, as if from his very soul.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey sat terrified and helpless, "Oh, sir," he cried, "what shall I do? You
                     will kill yourself and me by this terrible agitation! I must have help—I must
                     go for help—" he repeated scarcely knowing what he said.</p>
                  <p>As he moved to the door Mr. Cranburn raised his head; he could not yet speak,
                     but he laid his hand on the young man's arm to detain him. The flood of tears
                     had brought relief, and he soon commanded himself sufficiently to say, "Do not
                     call any one; what I have to say must be between ourselves. The shock though
                     came near being too great. This announcement so suddenly of the death of—my
                     wife—has quite unmanned me."</p>
                  <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5590-00000052"/>
                  <p>"Your wife!" repeated Geoffrey, looking into that pallid face with blank
                     amazement.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my wife, Geoffrey—your aunt Edith is my own wife! And now you may imagine
                     my emotions on reading those dying expressions of strong attachment."</p>
                  <p>"No, not dying, though," said Geoffrey, eagerly, "not dying! Read
                        <emph>this!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>But the letters swam dizzily before the earnest eyes endeavoring to decipher
                     them. The agitated man could not make out a line, and taking the paper from his
                     trembling hand, his young companion, almost as much excited as himself, read
                     aloud the note from Ilia.</p>
                  <p>"Thank God! oh, thank God!" exclaimed Mr. Cranburn, fervently. "If I can but
                     see her again I will devote the rest of my life to benefiting the world,—to
                     making others feel a little of the happiness I now experience."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey looked upon his old friend with an anxious, puzzled countenance. The
                     recent pallor of his face was gone, his faintness had disappeared as suddenly
                     as it came, and he sat erect with an almost youthful flush on his face, as he
                     said in reply to that questioning gaze:</p>
                  <p>"It is a strange story, Geoffrey, I wonder I never told you before. But I could
                     not altogether divest myself of some remnants of mortification attendant on the
                     matter. When I married your aunt Edith now nearly thirty-five years ago, I was
                     just ten years her senior. She was but fifteen. It was a foolish thing to marry
                     such a child, but I loved her sincerely and thought I could not wait. In
                     appearance and manner, and in maturity of mind she was very far in advance of
                     her years. I should have remembered, however, that precocity does not
                     necessarily imply wisdom, or the endurance and experience necessary to a good
                     wife. Brilliant and mature though she might seem, she was still a child, and I,
                     alas! expected the steadiness and thoughtfulness of a woman. She was tall and
                     finely proportioned, and her face was very beautiful then, Geoffrey, does she
                     at all retain that beauty now?"</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Edith is very pale, and the expression of her countenance is very
                     sad.—beside, she always wears a widow's cap, and black garments which make her
                     look still more mournful. But I think no one can look upon her face
                     lightly—there is an attraction which lures us to look again. A sweet and mobile
                     countenance. And then she is so good, so patient, so loveable altogether—I
                     cannot tell exactly where lies her greatest charm."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn smiled: "Well," said he, softly, as if the picture were not
                     displeasing, "The first interruption to our happiness, I remember, was the
                     failure in my business. We had lived in a very thoughtless round of gayety
                     these few months of our married life, and we were just about starting to make
                     the tour of Europe, when the fearful truth was forced upon me, that my affairs
                     were in a very critical condition.</p>
                  <p>"I had supposed myself wealthy,—so much so, that I did not think it worth my
                     while to look into particulars. My father's business I had inherited after his
                     death; all I did was to draw my supplies, while I left the entire management to
                     the active partners; but about this time something occurred to excite my
                     suspicions. Looking a little deeper into affairs, the truth began to dawn upon
                     me—I was ruined. Our trip to Europe had of course to be dropped. This was the
                     first great disappointment to my wife. She did not bear it well; she spent
                     hours in crying over her disappointment. There never was any one so hardly
                     used—she wished she had never married. If she had staid at home with papa and
                     mamma she would have had every thing she pleased. I was angry with her childish
                     complaints, and may be a little harsh—for she began to be afraid of me, and
                     fled to her mother at every opportunity.</p>
                  <p>"This was but the beginning; my child wife was called on for daily, hourly
                     sacrifice. Her whole soul and heart had been in the beautiful life which wealth
                     and fashion insured her elegant but undeveloped nature, and now everything was
                     being stripped away. To look upon life thus bare and disfigured was distasteful
                     to her young eyes; I could not get her to listen to my difficulties and
                     determinations. My intention was to give up everything and begin life anew,
                     rather than any one should lose by my gross, unpardonable carelessness. But my
                     wife could bear no explanations; she seemed to feel as if I was doing all this
                     to vex her—she was angry and resentful. This disaster made me stronger; it
                     roused the man in me, but it destroyed my child-wife.</p>
                  <p>"Still I thought this impatience and determination not to be reconciled to our
                     change would pass over, and she would be just to me, and prove her love; but I
                     was mistaken. Her father and mother I thought injudiciously sympathised with
                     her. I fancied they indulged her in the idea that I had deceived them—they
                     treated me coldly, while they lavished every fondness upon her. Her health was
                     failing, they said, she must have a change, must travel. Accompanied by her
                     parents she visited the places of fashionable resort, and entered again into
                     all their gayeties. 'It pleases me so much,' her mother wrote, 'to see the
                     bright smile once more on my poor child's face!' They were gone many weeks. I
                     worked on cheerfully, however, getting my affairs extricated from their
                     confusion, and gladdened with the hope that I would still have enough left to
                     give my Edith a snug little home. But when they returned she would not come
                     back to me. She was resolved, she wrote me word, to stay at home with her
                     parents—it was the only place where she could be happy.</p>
                  <p>"I will not detain you with a recital of my despair, and the efforts I put
                     forth to regain her confidence. She would not see me. I wrote again and again;
                     the invariable answer was that her determination was final. I at last declared
                     that I would not receive her decision as final until I had it from her own
                     lips. I thought that she must be influenced by others; I had yet to learn that
                     the cool resolution of a selfish girlhood could overawe the passionate
                     earnestness of maturest manhood. She heard me, but that was all. When I asked
                     if her decision was still unchanged, she coldly bowed her young head, and left
                     the room. Oh, how I had loved that girl! so sparkling, so brilliant, so
                     beautiful! But I left the house resolved never to see her again. I did not
                     think then that Edith loved me. Often had I been made painfully aware that I
                     lacked the ability to stimulate her to highest enjoyment; I was conscious that
                     far duller minds than mine had more power to elicit the full brilliancy of her
                     nature, and the captivating graces of her mind and manner; with me she was dull
                     and exacting. Had I thought it possible she really loved me, I would have
                     waited, and in after years have tried to woo her again. But there was so much
                     of dislike in her unmoved bearing that I was strengthened to leave her
                     forever."</p>
                  <p>"How hard it is to realise," said Geoffrey, "that aunt Edith should ever have
                     been so unjust. But this solves the riddle of her life; her humility, her deep
                     sadness, her martyr-like spirit have ever been enigmas to me—now I understand
                     it all."</p>
                  <p>"I then," continued Mr. Cranburn, "immediately closed up my affairs. I was glad
                     to be able to pay every creditor in full; but this left me barely sufficient to
                     come hither. But fortune followed me. I commenced as clerk in the house of
                     which I am now principal. I have been unusually successful as far as money is
                     concerned, but I feel that by this early misfortune my life has been in a great
                     measure lost. For many years I was morose and sour, avoiding all society,
                     really hating it in all its ways; hating those that composed it; hating
                     everything living, and only desiring to work, that I might lull the unrest that
                     pursued me. But time, the destroyer, is also, as some one has said, the
                     restorer, and it brought me at length to a better mind. I began to feel that I
                     had no right to this wealth unless I let others share its benefits; and I have
                     tried since then to diffuse it aright.</p>
                  <p>"I had never heard from my wife again until I saw you, Geoffrey. Some years
                     after my arrival here I instituted inquiries by a trusty friend in regard to
                     the family, but<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5590-00000053"/> without result. He
                     could discover little concerning them. Edith's father had failed in business,
                     and had removed with his family from the more southern city where they resided,
                     to New York; here all information ceased. My agent followed up the inquiry in
                     that great vortex of life, but without success. I heard nothing more of them,
                     until one day glancing over an old file of papers which had been thrown in to
                     fill up a package of goods from New York, I read, dated many years back, the
                     marriage of Geoffrey Luperthorp, esq., to Gertrude, youngest daughter of
                     Winfield Wyoming. Edith had a young sister Gertrude—that was the sole trace I
                     had of them for all these years. So now, Geoffrey, you understand my attraction
                     to you, and why I devoured your home-letters so hungrily; you were the sole
                     link between myself and the past. But, my boy, your own worth has tightened the
                     strange chain that bound us; it would go hard with me now to part from one whom
                     I regard as a dear and only son.'</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">FAREWELL TO INDIA.</head>
                  <p>MR. CRANBURN, with his accustomed decision and promptness, now resolved once
                     more to visit his native land. He informed Geoffrey that he had been revolving
                     this thing sometime in his own mind, and for the last two years had been
                     shaping his business to this end.</p>
                  <p>"I have lately felt," said he, "from her letters to you, and from words you
                     have dropped in regard to her, that my wife perhaps regretted her past life,
                     and still remembered me with kindness. Sometimes, under the impulse of this
                     conviction, I have been inclined to sacrifice all to be with her at once. But
                     prudence dictated otherwise. I remembered how helpless I would be at my age, if
                     I risked the loss of my property or wealth, and I have strengthened myself
                     against my impatience, and waited.</p>
                  <p>"Another project I have been endeavoring to carry out mainly with reference to
                     you, Geoffrey, and that is to establish a branch of this house in New York,
                     with you at its head."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey warmly expressed his gratitude.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I will want to do a little something myself. I have been so long used to
                     active life in managing this extensive concern-that I do not wish to be
                     altogether without something to occupy my mind. So I will take part in some
                     way—but that is for a hereafter. Now it is very fortunate I have been
                     preparing, as I must go, no matter what may be the consequences."</p>
                  <p>They appointed to sail in the first steamer, which would leave in a fortnight
                     from that time.</p>
                  <p>As may be supposed there was an immense deal to be done in winding up their
                     present extensive business arrangements, but there was a great stimulus in the
                     happy anticipations of the future. And Mr. Cranburn was not one to multiply
                     trifling difficulties. He was liberal with all, and intricate calculations were
                     swept away impatiently with, "Make it your own way." He was too supremely happy
                     to be able to restrain this feeling from brimming over to others, and so from
                     the overflow of his full heart all were made joyful that had any connection
                     with him.</p>
                  <p>His business was transferred, under the most favorable auspices, to the hands
                     of some half dozen native and other clerks, who had been some years in his
                     employ. His house and grounds were sold, and the domestics well provided for;
                     friends were visited and goodbyes exchanged. Nothing remained to do, save to
                     take a last farewell of the good mother, Madame Duleep; a farewell which they
                     felt would be final, for Madame was not likely to meet them again should they
                     ever return to these shores.</p>
                  <p>On the afternoon preceding the day of their final departure from the home of so
                     many very busy and not unfruitful years they stepped once more into the
                     graceful boat, formed so perfectly for speed and comfort, and passed up the
                     river to the fine old mansion where Madame Duleep resided. This ancient
                     edifice, impressive in its massive grandeur, exhibited also great architectural
                     beauty. It was a castellated building of dark stone, with facings and ornaments
                     of the chunom, so much used in that country, and which, white and polished as
                     marble, somewhat relieved its somber aspect. It stood upon an inlet of the
                     river, a small, indented bay, whose borders were lined with the drooping
                     bamboo, dipping its long branches gracefully into the pure waters of the
                     stream, while countless palms rose magnificently above, darkening the rich
                     verdure of the grassy slope extending between the castle wall and the river.
                     The effect of this light and shade was most picturesque from the water view,
                     and to Geoffrey the scene on this last day appeared in new beauty, as though he
                     beheld it for the first time. The afternoon sun shining athwart the old towers,
                     and penetrating the luxuriant foliage of the tall trees, whose shadows seemed
                     to hide in their silence and depth an unspoken mystery not to be described,
                     while through occasional openings in those regal palms, an intenser ray entered
                     here and there unchecked, falling sharply on the massive walls, lighting up
                     brilliantly some fine point of architecture, or elaborate ornament, and with
                     the finger of an artist touching with a more exquisite beauty what was already
                     beautiful—all these things to the heart of the youthful traveler spoke with the
                     solemn sadness of farewell.</p>
                  <p>A flight of marble steps led from the water's edge. Ascending these they passed
                     across a broad mosaic pavement and entered a circular court, surmounted with a
                     mosque-like dome of glittering glass. A native Bengalee now appeared and said
                     that his mistress would be happy to receive her guests. Opening a narrow iron
                     gate on one side of the court, he preceded them through a vaulted passage of
                     considerable length, when they again emerged to open air; a lovely little
                     garden, filled with rare and fragrant flowers smiled before them. Here the
                     attendant rang a small silver bell, and a young Parsee girl appeared.</p>
                  <p>The Parsee, more favored by nature than many of the Indian race, presents some
                     of the finest specimens of that peculiar type; they are fairer, and generally
                     of more graceful form. This girl was a fine representative of her caste, and in
                     her rich beauty, surrounded by this paradise of loveliness, might have been
                     fitly deemed, as Geoffrey silently thought, an eastern houri, admitting them to
                     some celestial home.</p>
                  <p>Courtesying low, she threw open the glass door at the end of the gravel walk.
                     Even when this houri disappeared the illusion was scarcely dispelled, for
                     Madame Duleep in her flowing robe of white, appeared like a spirit within. She
                     was reclining in a cushioned chair, apparently very weary. The strength of the
                     body was evidently wasting, but the power of the soul was still radiant on the
                     noble brow.</p>
                  <p>She was happy beyond measure to see them once more, but did not attempt to rise
                     as they entered, drawing her large cashmere shawl more closely about her form
                     as the door was thrown open to the visiters. She smiled as she did so, and with
                     a slight shiver.</p>
                  <p>"This is unusual for me," said she, in a low voice, "unusual for me—accustomed
                     to brave all weathers. But my inheritance of life is spent. And now the
                     question comes, as it must come to all—have I spent it well?"</p>
                  <p>"Madame," said Mr. Cranburn, "if you have failed, you leave us hopeless of
                     smaller efforts."</p>
                  <p>She shook her head doubtfully; "Ah, the retrospect shows many mistakes! Had I
                     my life to live over I could avoid much error, and do much that now remains
                     undone. But perhaps the fulfillment of unfinished duties will constitute the
                     enjoyment of the future. Yet I am not of the religion of my father, who
                     believed that the spirit would return to earth again to perfect its virtues and
                     to punish its faults; onward and upward—is my belief!" and the venerable head
                     was raised erect, the glance of the clear eye seemed to reach afar. "Yes!" she
                     exclaimed, "the realities of the unseen world are upon me! I almost fathom
                        the<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5590-00000054"/> light beyond. Oh, these are
                     rapturous moments, my friends. It is worth living a lifetime of care and trial,
                     to taste even for <choice>
                        <sic>anstant</sic>
                        <corr>an instant</corr>
                     </choice> the joys that come at its close."</p>
                  <p>Her voice was clear and touching; its gentle minor key thrilled Geoffrey's
                     heart, already attuned to sadness by the farewell to many familiar scenes and
                     pleasant associations. He covered his face with his hands, while the tears
                     crept silently down his cheeks. Yet it was not intense grief which affected him
                     thus; he had often experienced more painful emotion which was outwardly
                     unmarked. But the pathos of that sweet voice touched a responsive chord in his
                     soul, which the excitement and fatigue of the past few days had rendered
                     peculiarly sensitive. These tremulous modulations of a voice that seemed
                     passing away, like the last echo of some grand æolian strain, into the silence
                     of eternity, made the listener weep from an indescribable sense of nearness to
                     an invisible world.</p>
                  <p>The aged woman at once perceived his agitation, and assumed a more cheerful
                     tone.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive me, my young friend," she said, "forgive me—I forget all but myself. I
                     am so much alone, and feel so on the very verge of life, that I am as it were
                     in a waking dream, communing with the future more than the present. But I am so
                     happy my work is done—I am only waiting. It cannot be that you weep in pity for
                     me. Ah! that reminds me that you come to say farewell. Come—come nearer me my
                     child. I have always felt a true friendship for you. May God bless your
                     truthful and beautiful soul, and may your future ripen the fair fruit of which
                     your present gives such rich promise!"</p>
                  <p>"And to you, my old friend," she said, turning to Mr. Cranburn, and taking his
                     hand affectionately, "it is most hard to say farewell. I have ever found you
                     the ready champion of right, the guardian and defender of human liberty; the
                     wise adviser; the friend of the oppressed. You have followed the Divine
                     intuitions of your own soul. without expectation or hope of reward, and the
                     world is better for your being in it—this is the highest praise we ought to
                     expect. I grieve to have you leave just now—we need you here. Alas, alas, my
                     poor people! My unfortunate countrymen! Crushed and degraded, fearfully
                     brutalized in their mistaken vengeance! Would that there were more spirits like
                     yours, just, strong and true, to whisper peace and love."</p>
                  <p>Painfully agitated by her emotions, Madame Duleep lay back faintly on the
                     pillows and closed her eyes. Mr. Cranburn fearing further excitement for her
                     over-wrought nature, called in the attendants, and bidding her a last and
                     tearful adieu the two friends took their departure.</p>
                  <p>It was sometime before either Mr. Cranburn or Geoffrey recovered their usual
                     spirits. Indeed, throughout that long, last evening a deep melancholy tinctured
                     their words and thoughts, which constantly reverted to Madame Duleep. Geoffrey
                     recalled with gratitude her devotion to poor Weston, and the kindly
                     ministrations that lightened his trembling passage to the grave—her untiring
                     watchfulness of the unfortunate and deserted Isabel. In all the manifestations
                     of her lofty yet sympathetic soul she nobly justified the epithet by which the
                     natives loved to distinguish her, "The Holy Mother."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Mr. Cranburn, after reciting several incidents of her benevolence,
                     which had come under his own observation, "her deeds of mercy can be counted by
                     hundreds. Indeed Geoffrey," said he, with much feeling, "no nobler subject
                     could be presented to my mind than this woman, who through a long lifetime has
                        <unclear>followed</unclear> the highest dictates her soul. The knowledge of
                     so elevated a character long since apologised to me for wrongs which I deemed I
                     had suffered at the hands of her sex, and gave me faith again in
                     womanhood."</p>
                  <p>The following morning augured a most glorious day, and who could long remain
                     sad in the presence of such sweet anticipations of the future as gilded the
                     departure of our travelers? Fears and forebodings are for the silence and gloom
                     of night, but in the light of this cloudless day, and the bustle of
                     preparation, they could not be otherwise than <choice>

                     </choice> and of good cheer. As the two stepped on board one of the splendid
                     steamers of the overland company's line, a smile was upon the face of each, as
                     if this voyage and the life-long change it betokened were some festive
                     undertaking for a day's relaxation.</p>
                  <p>Many warm friends accompanied them to the vessel, and some whose sadness at
                     parting cast a momentary shadow on their serenity of mood. But the soft and
                     balmy breath of this winter atmosphere—though we of northern birth, to whom
                     that word always conveys a sense of shivering and snow, would hardly name it
                     such—came laden with inspirations that had no kinship with melancholy. Here was
                     no coldness, barrenness and waste; vegetation was still rife, life was all
                     aglow, the friendly shores to which they waved adieu were clothed with <choice>
                        <sic>verdude</sic>
                        <corr>verdure</corr>
                     </choice>, as with lingering gaze they watched it recede. The last murmur from
                     the crowd upon the wharf, the last glimpse of the city spires faded away, and
                     India was a memory of the past.</p>
                  <p>The first few days of their voyage glided peacefully away like a pleasant
                     dream; they stopped at the usual points, touching at the lovely island of
                     Ceylon, which shone through the mellow haze of the atmosphere a perfect mass of
                     bloom, beaming in all its tropical magnificence. The palm and cypress, and the
                     malestama with its superb blossoms, clustered in thick luxuriance; beneath them
                     a turf of unfading green was studded with dazzling flowers, and the rocks of
                     the shore were festooned with mosses and creeping plants, which at this season
                     exhibit their greatest brilliancy and profusion.</p>
                  <p>Leaving this beautiful spot, with its busy little town, they crossed the Indian
                     ocean to Alden,—the Eastern Gibraltar, as it is called—the remnant of an
                     ancient Arabian city; but its glory has departed, and it is now little more
                     than a British military station, its impregnable situation, however, forms a
                     grand feature of the scenery. Here the voyagers were supplied with fruits of
                     many kinds, pomegranates, dates, grapes and melons, brought in from the
                     surrounding country by the unwearying camels.</p>
                  <p>The next stopping place was Suez, and Geoffrey roused an instant from his dream
                     of the luxurious splendors of these tropical lands, as he looked ruefully over
                     the burning unhealthy flat upon which it is situated. The inhabitants of the
                     place, few and sickly looking, were anything but attractive.</p>
                  <p>From this dreary town they crossed the drearier desert. This unpleasant portion
                     of their journey, however, was made as bearable as possible by easy stages and
                     tolerably comfortable resting places for the night—but it was miserable enough
                     withal, and the eye and heart wearied of plodding slowly through deep sands,
                     and looking out monotonously on the barren wastes before them.</p>
                  <p>But all grew fair again, and their toil was well repaid as they approached
                     Cairo by the improved roads, and came in sight of the memorable Nile, and the
                     distant Pyramids, looming up far and faint in the purple atmosphere: these
                     wonderful monuments of man's ancient date and power impress themselves like a
                     thought upon the scenery that surrounds them, setting it apart with a spiritual
                     significance from common things. At least so thought Geoffrey, over whom the
                     mystery of the past and the beauty of the present threw their spell of
                     enchantment.</p>
                  <p>In Cairo, the Mohammedan capital, the travelers saw something of Egyptian
                     grandeur. Its fine buildings and palaces, its elaborate architecture of mosque,
                     dome and minaret, were gorgeously surrounded by gardens filled with rarest
                     flowers, and shaded by orange and olive trees. The scene that was presented to
                     the eye bore the semblance of pomp and luxury. The mixed population, though
                     showing quite a preponderance of the European element, still retained enough of
                     the native to add by their gay costume picturesque effect and brilliancy to the
                     busy streets.</p>
                  <p>From Cairo they embarked on the Nile, whose waters, now at their lowest ebb,<pb
                        n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5590-00000055"/> were covered with numerous boats,
                     and whose flat banks were dotted here and there with small villages, which
                     seemed sleepily awaiting some future rising of the sluggish waters.</p>
                  <p>On through the great Mahoudiah canal to Alexandria, or at least a few miles
                     from it—then taking steamer again, they entered the blue waters of the
                     Mediterranean—thence to Malta, Gibraltar, Southampton—the tropical dream was
                     passed:—taking steamer again they sailed for their beloved New York.</p>
                  <p>Joyful though weary, they looked with hopeful glances toward their native land,
                     as a haven of future rest and peace.</p>

                  <p>AS may be supposed, those at home were much interested in Geoffrey's friend and
                     benefactor. Through numerous graphic descriptions in many an eagerly read
                     letter received from the young traveler, Mr. Cranburn had come to be as much
                     talked about and as well beloved there as though personally known to them. And
                     surely it is not quite impossible that he might have sometimes felt the sweet
                     influence of aunt Edith's prayers, ever ascending in heart-felt gratitude for
                     all his kindness to her beloved boy.</p>
                  <p>The announcement that this friend was to accompany Geoffrey on his return
                     voyage, caused no little joy and excitement at the cottage.</p>
                  <p>The letter which brought this statement also contained the joyful tidings that
                     there was great probability Geoffrey might arrive in time to spend his
                     twenty-fifth birthday at home. It lacked now but three days of that time; the
                     letter having been delayed on its way had just arrived. Previous epistles had
                     prepared them to expect his speedy return, but this announcement fairly brought
                     him to their very door! A delightful consternation spread through the quiet
                     little mansion:</p>
                  <p>"Three days! only three days!" cried the young girls, skipping about from one
                     room to another, kissing aunt Edith with renewed rapture, and generally
                     conducting themselves in an extravagant manner that would not do to commit to
                     paper. Aunt Edith was calmest of all—the enthusiasm having spread even to the
                     kitchen, and every member of the household dutifully adding their part to the
                     whirlpool of hurry and expectation.</p>
                  <p>But the great question which the young ladies now discussed was what to do with
                     Mr. Cranburn. As a matter of course he would stay with them—"You would not hear
                     of anything else, would you, aunt Edith?" They always called their adopted
                     mother by this title; she liked it best, because it was connected with many
                     pleasant associations.</p>
                  <p>"Of course we must keep him here. Any one who has been so kind to our cousin
                     Geoffrey must stay with us—and like us, too;" said the low but decided voice of
                     Ilia.</p>
                  <p>Ilia was the familiar abbreviation by which the younger of the Cecilias was
                     distinguished in the household.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, we would not wish anything else;" replied aunt Edith, "that is if
                     the gentleman is willing"—they had not considered that. "He has no doubt
                     friends of his own whom he may prefer to visit. I think Geoffrey says he is a
                     native of New York."</p>
                  <p>"But," said the fair Cecilia, sorrowfully, "It is so many years since he has
                        been<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5590-00000056"/> here. Just think!
                     thirty-five years! His friends must surely all be dead."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," repeated aunt Edith, "thirty-five years! thirty-five years—yes, it has
                     been a long, long time!" she whispered to herself, and the silent tears crept
                     slowly down her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Don't, dear aunt Edith," said Ilia, affectionately kissing the forehead of the
                     invalid, over which were parted the locks already sprinkled with gray;
                     "Geoffrey is so near—the day after to-morrow will be the twentieth of April!
                     Aunt Edith you could'nt surely cry to-day! Come, Cecilia, where are we to put
                     the stranger? I have it!" said she, brightly, after a thoughtful pause. "We
                     will give him our room, Cecilia. There is but a short passage between that and
                     the tower, you know, and so he and Geoffrey will be near each other."</p>
                  <p>The arrangements for Geoffrey's coming had all been made long since, only a few
                     last finishing touches remained to be added—those last touches of preparation
                     over which we delight to linger, pleasing our fancy with sweet anticipations of
                     the coming meeting, and the eyes that shall beam brightly upon our efforts when
                     those we are working for, the absent, the loved ones return.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was much alone these busy days. Yet hardly alone; her own thoughts
                     were too full of by-gone times and anticipated future, to feel altogether
                     alone. And these young voices moving about in every quarter—singing, laughing,
                     ever merry—the repeated comings and goings for directions, and to see if she
                     were lonely, or did she want anything, scarcely gave her an opportunity to feel
                     isolated. The busy young hearts could not enjoy themselves fully without her
                     co-operation. Anxious comments on her looks were sure to follow their short
                     absences; sometimes she was pale—they feared she was exhausted; perhaps on
                     their next entrance they would find her a little flushed, she must have a
                     fever! So these sweet affectionate girls, devoted in their love, sought to woo
                     her from the melancholy of sickness—how could she feel any want? And all this
                     happy tumult was for Geoffrey, her own Geoffrey. They wondered if he were
                     changed—they conjectured how he looked—and if he were the same bright,
                     cheerful, and loving nature.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was busy too. Reflections of the past filled her soul to
                     overflowing. What if her Geoffrey should be changed? Ralph had so
                     changed—well—perhaps not changed altogether—his cold and practical youth gave
                     promise of the man. Geoffrey was different; so light-hearted and loving; but
                     then he had gone through so many strange scenes, and had been compelled to
                     buffet with so many strange circumstances—it might have made great changes. But
                     of one thing she thought she might still be assured—that he loved her. To think
                     of his coming such a journey and so promptly when he knew of her danger!</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith had suffered severely for the last two years, but she had held this
                     anguish in her own breast; only herself knew of these weary nights of
                     wakefulness and days of increasing pain. For the last six months she had been
                     under medical charge, and this, with the excellent nursing she had received had
                     much ameliorated her sufferings; although the disease was becoming still more
                     fixed she now enjoyed comparative rest.</p>
                  <p>It being extremely painful to remain in a reclining position, the invalid never
                     left her cushioned chair day or night; want of sleep was wearing out the system
                     very rapidly; but she was cheerful and happy, and it was a pleasure to her
                     adopted children, who were her constant and untiring attendants, to care for
                     and watch over her.</p>
                  <p>Ilia was occupied some hours of each day, but on her return took her place
                     devotedly beside the sufferer, reading, talking, and entertaining her in every
                     way that a fertile imagination could suggest.</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, my dear," aunt Edith would say, "you are wearing out your young life in
                     this persistent endeavor to prolong mine. Do not do so, dear child. I am
                     willing and ready to go. My usefulness is at an end, but yours is just
                     beginning. You need all your strength for your work. It is a great work, Ilia,
                     and it adds much to my peace of mind that I leave behind me one so capable of
                     taking my place. But you must have health—without health the energies fail. So
                     I insist for your own sake, for all our sakes, that you take more rest."</p>
                  <p>But these urgent entreaties were met with a burst of passionate feeling:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my mother—my more than mother!" sobbed the young girl, "my heaven-sent
                     guardian and protector! whatever I am or expect to be is from you. Why talk to
                     me of death? If you die, I must die too. If I am to succeed, if my efforts are
                     to benefit any, I must have you with me. Through you I can have everything,
                     without you nothing! If you wish to destroy me, then oblige me to sit with
                     folded hands—you will not do this, my mother! It is health, energy, joy to be
                     with you: you will not hinder me then, will you?" she said, with a look of most
                     affectionate persuasion.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith could only smile, looking into that face turned so pleadingly to
                     hers, and reply that she supposed she must submit; "I am helpless in your
                     hands, you self-willed, impetuous girl!"</p>
                  <p>But there was pity as well as love in the kindly gaze she sometimes fixed upon
                     Ilia's earnest countenance: a yearning pity: so much so that the young girl
                     herself noticed it.</p>
                  <p>"Dear mother," she said, "why do you look on me so sadly, always?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, my Ilia," whispered aunt Edith in her silent thoughts, "would that great
                     soul of yours had its fitting temple. Ardent, enthusiastic, it lies like a
                     hidden diamond within an unattractive casket. How that glowing heart craves for
                     love—no common love—pure, strong, undying. But will it ever find it? To inspire
                     such love the exterior must correspond to the soul's bright
                     intelligence—beautiful thoughts flow from beautiful lips, and brilliant wit
                     sparkle from lustrous eyes. But alas, my poor Ilia,—poor child!" Unconsciously
                     she had murmured the last words aloud, startling herself from her sad
                     reverie.</p>
                  <p>"What 'poor child,' aunt Edith?" repeated the watchful listener.</p>
                  <p>"Did I speak then? I was but dreaming, Ilia—a sort of waking dream, I
                     suppose."</p>
                  <p>"The Cecilias," being so interesting to the writer, to aunt Edith, and to the
                     coming guests, should be introduced to the reader together, (surmising that
                     "gentle" personage to be equally interested) with all possible advantage.
                     Still, truth must govern the picture—and truth is not always flattering.</p>
                  <p>It would be difficult to conceive of two more opposite in nature than these
                     young girls. Yet they were both so excellent that aunt Edith could scarcely
                     tell which she loved most. Ilia undoubtedly possessed greater faults of temper
                     than did the more meditative Cecilia; but these very faults, in her efforts to
                     overcome them, her indignation with herself, and self-accusation at repeated
                     failures, made her perhaps more loveable—these shadows contrasted with the
                     brighter hues of her high-wrought, sensitive nature rendering her character
                     more distinct and interesting. The girls were not at all related, yet they were
                     unusually attached, each thinking the other perfect, and striving to attain the
                     beauty which each saw in the other's soul.</p>
                  <p>Ilia strove diligently to acquire the calm moderation of her gifted companion,
                     the self-knowledge which rendered exquisitely clear the perceptions and
                     intuitions of her well-balanced mind. Cecilia equally emulated the seemingly
                     less favored Ilia in that mental force, vivid impulse, generosity and spiritual
                     elevation which were her peculiar characteristics.</p>
                  <p>"I should like to live above the clouds, sometimes, as you do, Ilia," her
                     friend would say with innocent admiration.</p>
                  <p>"But you would not like so well the terrible tumble-downs that accompany the
                     elevation," was the gay reply.</p>
                  <p>In personal advantages there could not be a parallel drawn between the maidens.
                     Cecilia, the eldest by a few months, was really beautiful, almost perfect in
                     her loveliness. No one could look upon her without admitting her charms. Tall,
                     graceful, with a complexion fair, soft and delicately colored as the blushing
                     peach, faultless features, and a countenance of sweetest<pb n="112-113"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000057"/> expression, thoughtful and reflective, she was
                     one of those finished master-pieces which nature in some happy mood delights
                     herself in perfecting. Her beautiful spirit, vailed in most alluring charms,
                     yet wore the mantle lightly, as if unconscious of its distinction. No action
                     displayed the slightest recognition of her own superiority, or the vanity which
                     often blights these unusual gifts.</p>
                  <p>But what shall we say of Ilia, dark, plain and shadowy beside these bewitching
                     perfections? She, too, was distinguished by munificent nature, but not with any
                     of her outward graces; there were no cunning shades of expression, there was no
                     fascinating play of feature to relieve the unattractive exterior, rendered
                     doubly so by nearness of contrast with her lovely companion.</p>
                  <p>Yet those who knew her, and loved to explore the depths of her profounder and
                     subtler nature, found their admiration excited, their love of the beautiful
                     enhanced. Few, however, cared to trouble themselves in this way. Not many are
                     eager to search for hidden pearls, when the lustre of those already polished,
                     if of less value, gleams fascinatingly upon them. The mind and senses equally
                     crave gratification in the perception of beauty; and through the outward
                     satisfaction of the senses we more readily attain to a perception of an inner
                     loveliness.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that I had but a shade of your beauty, Cecilia!" was the almost plaintive
                     cry sometimes wrung from the heart of the young girl, who felt in an
                     exaggerated degree her own defects when under the immediate flush and glow of
                     Cecilia's charms. "Cousin Geoffrey cannot help but love you, you are so
                     gloriously lovely—Oh! so lovely! And—and—I suppose he will scarcely notice me—I
                     shall be in the shadow while you are shining like morning!" An expression of
                     deep sadness stealing over the pale face belied the would-be lightness of the
                     words.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, ha!" said Cecilia, laughing, "Is that the trouble now! We do not know,
                     Ilia—he has been so long accustomed to those eastern beauties that he may
                     prefer your dark style."</p>
                  <p>But noticing the continued seriousness of her companion, she added, herself
                     becoming serious also, "Do you know, Ilia, I wish sometimes that I was not
                     beautiful, as you term it. I want to be natural—to do as I please—to forget
                     that I am the object of attention—to look at people, and have them look at me
                     without this consciousness being forever thrust in my face!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, the perplexities of a beauty!" laughed Ilia, now restored to her usual
                     gayety, "I must write a book about them. Where shall I begin?"</p>
                  <p>"You may laugh, but I'm in earnest! I'm tired of being forever on exhibition,
                     as if one were a picture set up for criticism. No soul! <emph>that</emph> never
                     comes into the question; it's by the coloring and shape of the surface we must
                     be prized or set aside. Besides, you make this cousin of ours the seeming
                     arbiter of our fate—that we must be so happy if he should fall in love with
                     either of us, and so very miserable if he does not! This is not like you,
                     Ilia!"</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Ilia, with a half apologetic air, whose playfulness covered a
                     deeper feeling than she chose to reveal, "it is as you say very likely he has
                     become a worshipper of some lovely houri whose enchantments we have no spell to
                     remove, but you know we have heard so much of him, and so learned to love
                     him—that I could not but feel pained if he should—as indeed I know he
                     must,"—looking up at Cecilia with a deep sigh, "entirely overlook me."</p>
                  <p>But the great work of preparation was over, and the morning of that wished-for
                     twentieth of April had really arrived at last. Geoffrey had said he would be
                     with them, and surely he must. Aunt Edith was accordingly wheeled in her large
                     chair into the bright little sitting-room. She had duly admired every
                     arrangement and improvement: there was a lull over the busy household, and the
                     busy hands of the eager girls had folded themselves with a sense of
                     self-complacence only attainable through her commendation.</p>
                  <p>The invalid sat by a low window looking out on the porch, and cast her eyes
                     down the sunny pathway of the little garden, bordered brightly on either side
                     with fragrant spring blossoms. Hyacinths, iris, jonquils and a host of others
                     made a brilliant phalanx, leading the way with flaunting banners down to the
                     spring, over which the old willow, now bursting into leaf, rose grandly in the
                     sunshine.</p>
                  <p>"How bright it all looks to-day!" said aunt <choice>
                        <sic>Edtih</sic>
                        <corr>Edith</corr>
                     </choice> withdrawing her gaze from the scene without to the scene within; the
                     cosy little room with the sun shining in it; the delicate white and blue
                     curtains festooning the windows, the cushions, chairs and sofas covered with
                     the same tint, and the cheerful fire burning in the grate, in order that fresh
                     air and open windows might not injure the invalid; everything was light, airy
                     and pleasant in this apartment, which was not reserved specially as a
                     guest-chamber, and chill with the sense of isolation, but was the home-room of
                     the little family, where they lived daily and worked daily. Vases, books and
                     flowers adorned it; a few small and exquisite paintings hung upon the walls;
                     they were Ilia's; "She is quite an artist—a genius in her way; and this
                     room—they have really made it beautiful between them!" thought aunt Edith, as
                     smiling and pleased she completed her survey.</p>
                  <p>"But, aunt Edith, you do not see the sweetest ornament of all—and that is your
                     own dear self! That cap is <emph>so</emph> becoming, and that soft white
                     drapery—well, aunt Edith, you do look like an angel! I should like to sketch
                     you just now—as it were looking down out of the clouds, with that silver
                     braided hair, and those dark, arched eyebrows. The contour is bewitching!"</p>
                  <p>"Silence, you foolish girl! you disturb my thoughts. There is room for but one
                     image there to-day. But Ilia, the hours wear on, and still he does not
                     come!"</p>
                  <p>At this moment Madeleine entered, all in a flutter of hurry and excitement,
                     gay, sprightly and expectant. Leaving her little girl and governess in the
                     carriage without, she had rushed in to hear the news.</p>
                  <p>"Has he come?" she said, breathlessly, kissing them all around. "No? that is
                     too bad! If he does not get here this morning then I shall not see him for some
                     weeks. We are off this afternoon for the south. Ralph has made all his
                     arrangements—this variable spring weather is so trying to his health! Oh dear!
                     it will be too provoking! How I wish he would come—I do so want to see him!
                     Aunt Edith," said she, more quietly, sitting down beside the sick-chair, "how
                     dearly we all loved him, he was so pleasant and so good. How happy seems the
                     remembrance of those young days!" A grave and thoughtful look replaced the
                     smile on the speaker's face.</p>
                  <p>"You are so aged and careworn now!" said the invalid with a smile, looking into
                     the almost girlish countenance before her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh no, not that! Well, it does sound very ridiculous to hear me talk so—but I
                     do feel old. It seems like looking away, away back, when I think of those
                     light-hearted days. Then troubles were so soon forgotten, and a good hearty cry
                     was the precursor of a still heartier laugh. Alas! the cares and anxieties and
                     frivolous nothings of life blot out all the blitheness and free-heartedness!
                     But let me see,—how long can I stay?" said Madeleine, taking out her jewelled
                     watch, "an hour, yes,—an hour and a half I might—and still be back in time. I
                     came out to give little Madeleine her morning drive. They can go on without
                     me—I will tell the coachman to be back in that time." She sprang up hastily and
                     ran out to give the order, as, though the thought of remaining was quite a
                     respite.</p>
                  <p>And it was indeed a great pleasure to throw off all restraint and rest beside
                     aunt Edith in this nest of quiet, beauty and love.</p>
                  <p>Her warm and affectionate nature was unfitted to be happy in cold and stately
                     formalities; and this morning in particular there was so much to talk about at
                     the cottage, and so many new arrangements to commend, an hour spent there would
                     be a real recreation. First, there was the library in the tower, for Geoffrey's
                     use. Madeleine was profuse in her expressions of admiration<pb n="114-115"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000058"/> tion. She spoke out with her old animation the
                     first words that came.</p>
                  <p>"How tasteful and elegant everything is! That window looking out on that shaded
                     little plot of verdure, where he can step into the open air and still be
                     alone—it is exquisite! And these book-shelves look so tempting, ranged around
                     the circular wall—I could almost become a bookworm here myself, with the garden
                     shining in upon me. This round table, and the chairs and carpet harmonize
                     beautifully. Dear! how perfectly comfortable! And this fine painting,—I think
                     you might have given it to me Ilia! You are too partial—keeping everything for
                     Geoffrey. But this portrait in the niche," said she, surveying a picture which
                     hung in a small alcove opening into the tower, "this is perfectly wonderful to
                     me, Ilia—how did you catch that expression?" turning round suddenly upon the
                     young artist, who answered with hightened color,</p>
                  <p>"Why, Madeleine, you see that I have heard so much of him and know so much of
                     his habits and ways, that I almost fancied I saw him. Beside, you know I have
                     seen a picture of him painted when he was a child."</p>
                  <p>"But you must not fall in love with your ideal," said Madeleine,
                     mischieviously, noting the still blushing face, "Yet this is almost reality. It
                     looks exactly as Geoffrey did when he went away."</p>
                  <p>They now ascended the circular stairway leading from this apartment to one
                     above, also appropriated to Geoffrey. This was the sleeping chamber, opening
                     from which were the dressing-room, and a large bedroom for the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"How complete and perfect everything is!" said Madeleine, as they returned to
                     the sitting room. "I almost envy you all this happiness, aunt Edith."</p>
                  <p>"Envy me, dear child! an old woman on the very borders of the grave."</p>
                  <p>"But you live so much while you do live, aunt Edith. One may exist a long time
                     and have scarcely the warmth of a living feeling about them. I don't know that
                     you understand me—indeed may be I hardly understand myself. But I feel when I
                     am with you and Cecilia, and Ilia, as if my heart beat with so many more
                     bounding throbs than ever at any other time—something of that kind I mean! I
                     feel so good—and every one looks so fair and beautiful, and—"</p>
                  <p>"Soul-beautiful, you mean, Madeleine," interrupted Ilia, laughing at her
                     enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and I feel as if I could take all the world in my arms, and hug them and
                     kiss them, as I do you dear aunt Edith!" suiting the action to the word.</p>
                  <p>But the carriage returned, and Madeleine must leave, although Geoffrey had not
                     yet arrived. She could hardly restrain a few tears of disappointment as seating
                     herself in that richly luxurious vehicle she was whirled away to her own
                     magnificent home. "Oh if Ralph would but wait till to-morrow!" she exclaimed as
                     she left.</p>
                  <p>It was now past mid-day, <choice>
                        <sic>aud</sic>
                        <corr>and</corr>
                     </choice> still no appearance of the expected guests. Some light refreshments
                     were brought in, but no one could eat;—they could only watch and wait.</p>
                  <p>Slowly enough the afternoon wore on. It was getting late; the shadows were
                     gathering; the garden which glanced so brightly in its morning lustre was
                     shaded now. Still darker seemed the little back room, where the morning's glad
                     expectation was gradually giving way to the evening's disappointment.</p>
                  <p>Poor aunt Edith was beginning to lose that habitual control over her keenest
                     emotions which had kept her placid and patient all this long sunny day. "The
                     birthday is nearly over," she murmured, "If I should never see him again!" The
                     agony of the scarcely spoken thought overwhelmed her so completely, that now as
                     if her heart would break she wrung her hands in bitter despair.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia threw her arms around the invalid and wept too, unable to offer any
                     word of comfort. But Ilia, sitting at their feet, grew inspired according to
                     the emergency. He must come—she knew he must. "For I am sure, dear aunt Edith,
                     the good angels will not allow such a dreadful disappointment to be put upon
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>Our travelers, too, on this twentieth of April, were spending a most
                     uncomfortable day. It had dawned upon them still out of sight of land. The
                     dense haze of the morning atmosphere rose like a wall to shut out the land
                     which they knew was near.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn and Geoffrey had long been traversing the deck, peering through
                     the mist that enshrouded them for a glimmer of the wished-for haven, but
                     through the chill and sunless atmosphere not the faintest outline had as yet
                     blest their longing sight.</p>
                  <p>The pale morning beams gradually overspreading the cold, gray sky, only made
                     the desolation around more desolate still. Heaving and rolling, the waste of
                     waters stretched before them, lapping its foam-edged waves with regular
                     precision, so regular that it would seem each graceful curve in its magnificent
                     sweep was marked by some mysterious line and plummet; monotonous, silent,
                     changeless, it bore no revelation of the shore secreted in that shrouding
                     fog.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn was painfully depressed this morning. He had been cheerful and
                     hopeful during the long, fatiguing journey, but now when so near its close, a
                     strange dread of what might be oppressed him.</p>
                  <p>"If <emph>she</emph> should be dead, Geoffrey!" he said.</p>
                  <p>"No, no," replied his hopeful companion, "no, no, we have no reason to think
                     so. See, sir, how splendidly the sun is rising! Hurrah!" he cried, springing
                     with a bound closer to the ship's side, "Caps off! it is here! Land, land
                     ahead!"</p>
                  <p>Up rolled the mist; the sea-gull, startled in its drowsy flight, flapped his
                     wings as if in sympathy with the shouts that arose from deck, till the ethereal
                     blue struggling through the clouds, seemed afar off to echo the joy.</p>
                  <p>The travelers, now elate and impatient, watched each nearing point, counting
                     the miles yet to be passed over. Their great fear was that they might arrive
                     too late to reach home that day. But notwithstanding their fears the afternoon
                     sun yet lingered on the waters, as the noble steamer entered the dock.</p>
                  <p>Without delay Geoffrey and his friend entered a carriage and drove to the
                     nearest hotel, where leaving Mr. Cranburn to endure as best he could the
                     tortures of suspense, the young man, as had been previously arranged, proceeded
                     in search of aunt Edith's cottage. He promised to return as speedily as
                     possible.</p>
                  <p>The directions to the cottage had been given so explicitly, that there was
                     little trouble in finding it. A rapid drive through the twilight streets of the
                     once familiar city, a brief passage through scented lanes and quiet gardens,
                     and the long dreamed of home was just before him, embowered in its beautiful
                     willows.</p>
                  <p>Dismissing the carriage at the entrance of the little lane, Geoffrey walked
                     down the path which led through it to the gate. Over the gate a stout young
                     serving-lass was leaning, evidently awaiting something or somebody. Some vague
                     notions of a grand escort—a trumpeting—a kingly parade when those from afar
                     should arrive, floated mistily through her mind. They would look so different
                     from the people around she would know them at once certainly. But this quiet
                     traveler, walking toward her, was one such as she might see any
                        day—<emph>he</emph> was not what she was looking for! She therefore did not
                     start to give the alarm as had been her intention on the faintest indication of
                     the coming guests, but stolidly kept her position.</p>
                  <p>As Geoffrey, however, approached, and stopping before her made his inquiries,
                     the damsel opened wide her eyes, and looked as if she might indeed take wings
                     and give the news.</p>
                  <p>"Pray don't!" said the young man, perceiving her intention, "I should like to
                     take them by surprise." Delighted she led the way to a side door, gently
                     opening which she beckoned him through the little hall, and he stood unseen at
                     the door of the sitting room just at the moment when aunt<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000059"/> Edith, losing all hope, uttered her exclamation
                     of disappointment.</p>
                  <p>A darker shadow in the darkening apartment, caused the dejected group to look
                     up, and "Geoffrey, my dear boy!" rang wildly through the room, as bounding
                     forward he clasped once more to his heart the dear guardian of his early
                     youth.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith sobbed and laughed by turns as she looked on the manly figure before
                     her. "Still the same Geoffrey!" she murmured. "But I had forgotten—here are
                     your cousins, the Cecilias, Geoffrey." He bowed low to the beautiful girl, who
                     now stood up to receive him. Both were embarrassed. "Ilia! my dear," aunt Edith
                     laid her hand half reprovingly upon the head resting against her drapery; she
                     thought an undue timidity restrained Ilia from rising. There was no reply; she
                     had fainted.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey lifted the insensible girl, and laid her upon a sofa. Lights were
                     brought in, and restoratives applied. Presently she began to revive.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was much alarmed, it was so unusual for Ilia to show any weakness.
                     "Poor child," said she, "her exertions have been too great lately, and the
                     excitement and fatigue have overcome her. I ought to be more careful of
                     her!"</p>
                  <p>Ilia was soon able to sit up on the sofa, but she was ashamed and confused, and
                     did not leave the shelter of the pillows and wrappers by which she was
                     surrounded for the rest of the evening.</p>
                  <p>"That I should have made such a scene!" she said with burning face to Cecilia,
                     when they were alone that evening, "How ridiculous our cousin must have thought
                     it."</p>
                  <p>But Geoffrey had taken his aunt's explanation, and thought no more about the
                     matter.</p>
                  <p>He was dimly conscious, during the few hours of that first evening, that his
                     beloved aunt sat beside him, as in old times, dear and loveable as ever. All
                     else was shaded, obliterated in the blaze of beauty that had broken upon him in
                     the presence of Cecilia. Aunt Edith did not perceive this, or take any notice
                     of his absence of mind. She was so happy and satisfied, experiencing so perfect
                     a heart-content, that she had no distinct thought or observation—all was a maze
                     of light and love and happiness.</p>
                  <p>But Ilia saw it all. Poor Ilia, accustomed to neglect, was wounded now, as she
                     sat unobserved of the long expected guest, obscurely shawled and pillowed on
                     the sofa. So many months and weeks she had looked forward to this meeting!</p>
                  <p>When our own feelings are interested we forget that others are ignorant of our
                     state of mind, and begin to think them unfair or ungrateful when they do not
                     recognise it. In these things finely organized natures are much more
                     troublesome than those which are harder and more indifferent. But Ilia was not
                     often thus unreasonable. She was not well this evening. She had so sympathized
                     with her dear adopted mother, and had grown to almost love this expected
                     cousin,—he might at least have noticed her! So she sat silent and moody till he
                     rose to go, then Ilia repented too late that she had added so little to the
                     charm of the evening.</p>
                  <p>Yet bewildered and dazzled and fascinated as he had been, Geoffrey had not
                     forgotten his friend. He thought of what Mr. Cranburn must be enduring in his
                     long suspense; yes, he must go.</p>
                  <p>"Why did you not bring your friend with you, Geoffrey? We have made
                     preparations to entertain him. Tell him I shall be most happy to have him make
                     his home here. I am, to be sure, a permanent invalid, but my good girls," she
                     said, looking pleasantly round, from one to the other, "will use their most
                     grateful endeavors to please him. We are all so much obliged to him for his
                     kindness to you, Geoffrey."</p>
                  <p>The young man bowed his thanks to the young ladies for their interest in him;
                     he promised to deliver the message, and would probably return with Mr. Cranburn
                     early on the next morning.</p>
                  <p>"But, aunt Edith," he remarked before he left, "I will not hear to your being
                     an invalid. You look much better than I expected pected to find you, and now
                     that I am here there must be means made use of to restore you to perfect
                     health."</p>
                  <p>"No, my dear boy, it cannot be! In this I am resolute. You will not distress
                     me, will you?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, well," said Geoffrey, kissing her affectionately, "we will speak of this
                     again. Good night now—you may expect us bright and early in the morning."</p>
                  <p>When our young ladies were smoothing their hair, and making other preparations
                     for rest in their little dormitory under the eaves, it was natural to talk over
                     the evening's occurrences. Their removal to this upper room had met with some
                     remonstrance on the part of aunt Edith, who much as she desired to be
                     hospitable, did not think it right her adopted children in their enthusiasm of
                     devotion to the coming guests should make martyrs of themselves. But Ilia, with
                     that self-sacrificing spirit of hers, had assumed the responsibility of
                     declaring this removal to be not only bearable, but unmistakably a great
                     advantage.</p>
                  <p>"Such a pleasant exchange, aunt Edith! Our view is so fine, and we have so much
                     more to think about! Before our prospect was bounded by the trees, but now,
                     from our diamond shaped window in the high peak of the cottage gable, we can
                     look right over the green fields out to the river, and moralise on those fair
                     islands beyond, so thickly peopled with their forced population of paupers and
                     criminals! Ah, how much thought it will suggest—and we so free, looking down on
                     it all from our eyrie above!"</p>
                  <p>But Ilia was not in one of her <choice>
                        <sic>philsophic</sic>
                        <corr>philosophic</corr>
                     </choice> moods to-night. She was gloomy and silent, and when Cecilia, her
                     beautiful face all aglow with animation, asked eagerly how she liked their new
                     cousin—wasn't he handsome? the only answer was, "I don't know—I don't care to
                     speak of him."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Ilia!" exclaimed her friend, still in gayest mood, and looking upon the
                     ungracious maiden with a mischievous glance, "I do begin to think you are in
                     love—you are so fitful and wo-begone! Ah, I see! It is a desperate case of love
                     at first sight! Upon mature deliberation I fear we must pronounce it that
                     terrible malady! What shall we prescribe?"—but she stopped abruptly; her lively
                     pleasantry was met by a passionate burst of tears.</p>
                  <p>"It is cruel of you to sport with my misfortune, Cecilia! I know I am plain,—I
                     know I am disagreeable. I do not need to be told of it—it is thrust before me
                     continually. Our cousin whom we had learned so to love, he too must let me know
                     I can give no pleasure to his senses! You are so beautiful, Cecilia, there are
                     no eyes or thoughts but for you! and then you laugh at my <choice>
                        <sic>mortificatien</sic>
                        <corr>mortification</corr>
                     </choice> and disappointment!"</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, no more of this," said Cecilia, in a deeply offended tone, "you
                     misunderstood me—I thought you knew me better. I shall be forced to think you
                     are envious of me, and that would be painful indeed."</p>
                  <p>Poor Ilia! with her inconsiderate words had flown all her anger. She was now
                     deeply penitent.</p>
                  <p>"Forgive, do forgive me, dear Cecilia. You have so often forgiven, can you
                     pardon me again? And do my words seem envious? How mean and contemptible!" and
                     now she sobbed outright, "Envious? how could I ever seem so? I would not have
                     you one jot less lovely than you are, Cecilia—the best and brightest of God's
                     creation! But—but—I never was made so painfully aware of what <emph>I</emph>
                     am, as this evening, and there was a bitterness and impatience came over my
                     heart that I could not control. I ought to be ashamed. I ought to be forever
                     kneeling in gratitude for what I am. You know this, dear Cecilia, and yet you
                     bear with me. I feel abased that I should ever grieve you!"</p>
                  <p>Cecilia was all forgiveness. She embraced her young companion again and again,
                     and endeavored to calm poor Ilia's self-accusing conscience. When morning came,
                     calling them to prepare for the expected visiters they were as happy as ever,
                     and none apparently more light hearted than our hasty Ilia.</p>

                  <head type="sub">REUNION.</head>
                  <p>GEOFFREY returned to the hotel that evening with a strange happiness filling
                     his heart; jubilant happiness such as he had never before experienced. He found
                     Mr. Cranburn pacing the long hall of the building with increasing impatience, a
                     prey to the most painful foreboding.</p>
                  <p>"Is it hope or despair, Geoffrey? Tell me quickly," he said as he came toward
                     the young man, his countenance flushed with excitement.</p>
                  <p>"Look in my face, sir!" said the other joyously, "Is there any despair there?
                     No sir! all is hope and happiness! Aunt Edith is much better than I expected to
                     find her—and I was astonished to see her so well. But she was so sadly
                     disappointed that I would leave her, and was only reconciled when I told her
                     that my friend was alone in a strange city, and would be anxiously expecting
                     me. So I have a pressing invitation for you to breakfast at the cottage, and
                     make it your home while you remain in these parts. Indeed sir, they are all
                     overwhelmed with gratitude for your kindness to me, my new cousins, as well as
                     my aunt,—and they are glorious girls! One of them has the most enchanting face
                     I ever beheld. I cannot describe it,—you will have to see it for yourself."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn smiled at the young man's enthusiasm, and patiently waited until
                     it was somewhat expended. Then he quietly suggested that it might be possible
                     he would like to hear of some one else.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey apologized with much fervor and some confusion, and dutifully went
                     into every particular of aunt Edith's health and appearance, describing
                     enthusiastically the lovely home where she resided. A gem—a paradise it
                     was!</p>
                  <p>It was arranged before parting for the night that they would start for the
                     cottage early in the morning; Geoffrey arranging to see his aunt alone, and
                     partially prepare her for the interview with the unknown guest.</p>
                  <p>"And in this you will have to be very cautious," said Mr. Cranburn, anxiously,
                     "I have many fears. If you find that any hints you may give alarm her, at once
                     refrain—I had rather wait in this state of torture until an operation is
                     performed that may possibly restore her to health, than run the slightest
                     risk."</p>
                  <p>"But, sir, she will not submit to have anything done! It is only you can
                     persuade her. I broached the matter last night, and she met me so decidedly,
                     and seemed so much distressed I was glad to drop the subject."</p>
                  <p>It was far into the night when their conference ended, and when they retired it
                     was hardly to sleep. Mr. Cranburn was anxious and fearful. He dreaded the
                     effect of announcing his return.</p>
                  <p>"If she should be snatched from me now, so near, my God!" he exclaimed "how
                     could I bear it."</p>
                  <p>But Geoffrey's sleeplessness arose from an entirely different cause. It was
                     elation not depression of spirits that troubled him. He had been drawn into the
                     fearful vortex of fascination for which there is no name until the victim names
                     it—Love. His only desire was to gaze upon that lovely face again. The face of
                     the other young lady he was puzzled to recall—whether in fact she were old or
                     young, fair or otherwise he really could not tell. He had been dazzled and
                     blinded, and all objects save one were lost to him. Vexed with himself, the
                     young man questioned what would aunt Edith think. He must have been very
                     negligent—this lady who had fainted so suddenly the evening before must be a
                     very delicate person, of that sensitive organization which cannot bear the
                     slightest shock. Certainly as his adopted <choice>
                        <sic>eousin</sic>
                        <corr>cousin</corr>
                     </choice>, his aunt Edith's ward she deserved some respectful attention. He
                     wondered what she had thought of his behavior. Poor Ilia!</p>
                  <p>The next morning bright and early saw the impatient visitors at the cottage
                     gate. Early as it was, aunt Edith was up and ready to receive her dear boy. The
                     young ladies were not yet visible. Mr. Cranburn remained in the parlor while
                     Geoffrey was ushered into the apartment of the invalid, on the other side of
                     the narrow hall.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was, as might be supposed, received with smiles and endearment.</p>
                  <p>"Sit down by me," said his aunt, "I want to see you in the clear light of day.
                     How little you have changed, Geoffrey! Only I think—well—you have grown I think
                     handsomer!"</p>
                  <p>"Now, aunt Edith! you make me vain." he answered with one of his bright <choice>
                        <sic>smiies</sic>
                        <corr>smiles</corr>
                     </choice>.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I did not say what I thought of you before!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, that's it,—I thought there would be some qualifications."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, my dear child, you will do well enough. You are browner, hardier,
                     more manly than you were. And you have not lost that fine, honest expression
                     that bespeaks a pure soul—Geoffrey that pleases me most of all. But where is
                     your friend?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was confused; <choice>
                        <sic>theis</sic>
                        <corr>this</corr>
                     </choice> question came a little unexpected, upsetting the caution with which
                     he had proposed to introduce the subject.</p>
                  <p>"Well, aunt Edith, the fact is,—he is in the next room! But I hardly know how
                     it would do to bring him in here—hem,—I mean so early in the morning!"</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey, my dear, you need not have hesitated; wherever I am, there you are
                     master. And beside, for all this friend has been to you, I feel under an
                     everlasting debt of obligation. I am truly anxious to see him, and thank him
                     with all my heart."</p>
                  <p>"Dear aunt," said Geoffrey, drawing his chair closer, "I will be frank with
                     you. I never was very good at managing anything! I have undertaken a job that I
                     would not do with any other woman on earth! But you are so strong, dear aunt,
                     will you help me in this?"</p>
                  <p>She looked at him earnestly, not understanding these remarks as applying to
                     herself; and seeing his agitation, a terrible fear came over her that he was in
                     danger or difficulty which he dreaded to reveal.</p>
                  <p>"Oh Geoffrey!" she gasped, "what has befallen you?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, dear aunt Edith!" he hastened to assure her. "I am all right! It is
                     about yourself I am speaking. Can you bear what I am going to say?"</p>
                  <p>"Bear? Why yes! I can bear anything Geoffrey!" she replied, inexpressibly
                     relieved.</p>
                  <p>"Can you bear to hear of one whom you have long loved—long mourned as
                     dead?"</p>
                  <p>She gazed at him with a vacant stare, as though paralyzed by his words, and not
                     fully <choice>
                        <sic>comprehrending</sic>
                        <corr>comprehending</corr>
                     </choice> them. He repeated them again, more slowly.</p>
                  <p>"Merciful God!" she cried, "he is here! My husband!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey opened the door, and beckoned Mr. Cranburn in.</p>
                  <p>But we will draw a vail over this reunion of two hearts that never should have
                     been separated. There are emotions too sensitive to be transferred to the most
                     delicate words.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn would listen to no expressions of contrition from his restored
                     wife.</p>
                  <p>"The joy I experience, and that I still trust is before us Edith," he said,
                     "would admit of many years of struggle and sorrow to bring it about, and still
                     leave a large balance in my favor. We have both erred. But surely we have been
                     well taught that which our lives, however short, must unfold to profit."</p>
                  <p>There was no hesitancy now in the plan by which they hoped to restore the
                     invalid to a degree of health.</p>
                  <p>"It must be done at once," she said. "Take me out of this fear of death—that I
                     may live, if it be only a few years of devotion to partially atone for my
                     former wrong. I dread—I do shrink from this dark ordeal," she said with an
                     almost hysterical cry, "but I will brave it all!"</p>
                  <p>There was a supremely happy circle gathered around the breakfast table late
                     that eventful morning. The warm April sun came in, paling the fire in the
                     little grate, resting daintily on the bright carpet, and softly lighting up the
                     pleasant scene, as it<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5590-00000061"/> crept through
                     the trellised shadings and curtains of the long french windows.</p>
                  <p>Great extent and sumptuous arrangement are not requisite for the exhibition of
                     taste or elegance. Here, in this little apartment, neatness, order and finish
                     made the place beautiful. The polished silver, the snow-white damask, the pure
                     china, and all the little delicacies so bountifully supplied, added a sense of
                     comfort to the pleasant picture—a comfort too often lacking amid the splendid
                     surroundings of grander homes.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was looking pale, almost as white as the pillows against which she
                     rested. Endeavoring to master her feelings she sat in her large arm chair at
                     the table, her husband on one side and Geoffrey on the other, looking upon
                     their faces as through the mazes of a dream.</p>
                  <p>"I open wide my eyes," she said, "and find it is truly a reality. To think,
                     Geoffrey, that your going away, which I regarded as so unmitigated a grief, as
                     an almost unendurable outrage on my lonely heart—to think of the great blessing
                     it has brought me! I shall never dare to murmur again, no matter what may be my
                     fate—no, never!"</p>
                  <p>Amid the cheerful group around that festive breakfast-table, was one only who
                     felt uncomfortable in spite of her smiling face. Ill at ease, and feeling the
                     awkwardness of her silence, Ilia sat by the side of Geoffrey, who endeavored by
                     many little attentions to make amends for former neglect. But constrained and
                     embarrassed, she only answered his remarks by monosyllables. There was a
                     painful nervous tremor observable in her actions. Even aunt Edith, though so
                     pleasantly preoccupied, could not but notice it. "Ah, I see it," thought she,
                     "I have talked with her so much about him—it is my own fault!"</p>
                  <p>She recalled the remarkable likeness that Ilia had painted, "Yes," sighed the
                     true-hearted lady to herself, "those vivid feeling of hers have been fostering
                     an idol till she has come really to love him. I fear it will not go well with
                     her, poor child! I must see to this faithfully."</p>
                  <p>But Ilia was taking the work from her hands. She was becoming conscious of her
                     enslavement, and beginning to do battle in her own behalf. She was provoked at
                     her own weakness; she saw the utter imbecility of wasting life in emotions that
                     could never bear fruit. Who would care or heed what she might feel? As well
                     might she expect a return of passion from the silent portrait above in the
                     tower.</p>
                  <p>The pride which formed a prominent trait in her character came to her aid. She
                     saw that though Geoffrey's words were directed to her, his eyes and thoughts
                     wandered ever to the beautiful Cecilia, and a pang of inconceivable
                     mortification shot through her inmost consciousness; like a sudden sword-thrust
                     it aroused her; she rallied, and became once more herself.</p>
                  <p>Presiding at the head of the board sat Cecilia, and as she dispensed the rich
                     cream and the fragrant coffee, a more graceful and attractive representative of
                     the rites of hospitality could scarcely be imagined. So thought Geoffrey, and
                     no one could wonder that his young heart was led captive by her charms. Ilia
                     knew their power, and had often gloried in their triumphs, but this morning she
                     was dispirited; a hearty burst of tears would have relieved her, but she
                     resolutely restrained the exhibition of any emotion.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia, just past her twentieth year, was entering on that womanhood whose
                     dawn is even more attractive than the immature graces of girlhood. With perfect
                     health, innocence of soul, and thoughtful dignity of manner, she was truly what
                     she seemed, a true woman, polished and refined. The full morning light and
                     simple morning attire increased rather than diminished her loveliness. Yet she,
                     also, was scarcely at her ease; perhaps the young stranger's evident admiration
                     disconcerted her. Her countenance, however, as well as her actions being more
                     under control than was possible with Ilia, this agitation did not betray itself
                     unpleasantly. Her changing color, flushing and receding with every thought and
                     emotion, only added a more bewitching charm to the fascination surrounding this
                     fair girl.</p>
                  <p>Ilia, now so completely silent, with no blushing grace to take the place of the
                     answering word, was a few months younger than Cecilia. Her countenance lacked
                     the color and light which, even apart from beauty of feature are a charm in
                     themselves. Her dress was of black, only relieved by narrow white wristbands
                     and collar of plainest linen.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey remembered that on the previous evening her dress had also been of the
                     same sombre hue, which might partly account for the opaque impression left upon
                     his mind. His morning observations, however, revealed the fact that her skin
                     though very smooth was also very dark, and that the heavy eyebrows almost
                     meeting over her downcast eyes were black, as were also the glossy braids of
                     her abundant hair. A fine forehead, a well proportioned head set upon a
                     graceful neck and shoulders, some-what redeemed the otherwise unattractive
                     exterior.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast aunt Edith was wheeled back to her chamber, where closeted with
                     her husband and Geoffrey she discussed the hazardous operation about to be
                     performed. Anxious and impatient to have it over, the invalid was resolved that
                     this dreaded ordeal should be no longer delayed, and that the physicians should
                     be in attendance on the following morning.</p>
                  <p>The next two weeks passed slowly with leaden wings over the anxious household,
                     every moment laden with the horrors of tedious suspense, and heart
                     sickness.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith passed safely through the fearful ordeal; the dangerous operation
                     which all so much dreaded, had been performed successfully, but life trembled
                     in the balance for many days afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn and Geoffrey were left solely to their own companionship, the
                     young ladies being in constant attendance on the patient night and day,
                     alternating in the necessary seasons of rest, but never leaving her.</p>
                  <p>The house was silent and dark. Even the sunlight, in that long fortnight,
                     seemed to shine less brightly in the little back-room, and on the narrow garden
                     path which Mr. Cranburn traversed daily with weary, waiting steps, unable to
                     leave, unable to seek more healthful and exciting exercise, for within that
                     curtained room just off the silent sunny pathway, all that made life dear to
                     him now, lay almost in the arms of death, yet faintly struggling to life. His
                     only satisfaction was in waiting to hear the half hourly reports which were
                     transmitted to him in writing by the faithful young nurses.</p>
                  <p>To vary the monotony of this sombre existence, he sought refuge with Geoffrey
                     in the library. This contained a small but careful selection of good books, and
                     several exquisite paintings adorned its walls. The portrait of Geoffrey Mr.
                     Cranburn especially admired as excellent in color and expression, vivid,
                     life-like and earnest.</p>
                  <p>A portfolio of drawings lay upon the table, some of them lovely little
                     gems.</p>
                  <p>"Who is the artist?" asked Mr. Cranburn, whose educated eye keenly appreciated
                     the master-touch of genius, the fine sentiment, the perfection of detail.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did not know.</p>
                  <p>In hunting over these sketches he came across a spirited portrait of Cecilia.
                     This was a great treasure to the young man; he could silently worship it in his
                     lonely hours, and do homage to the skill which had created so brilliant a work
                     of art. "There must be a genius somewhere around!" he said, and in his silent
                     thoughts he regarded Cecilia as the divinity. Of course. Her every look and
                     action spoke a superior mind.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they whiled an hour over the daily journals; in the silent and
                     absorbed life they were leading, many things caught attention, and served to
                     beguile the days of waiting, which would not in the ordinary activities of
                     life, have made any trace upon their minds. The news of the day, the current
                     items, contained little of interest; but two names continually surging up in
                     the sea of newspaper gossip, became day after day so familiar to the recluses
                     that unconsciously they daily looked to ascertain if<pb n="122-123"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000062"/> any thing more could be learned concerning these
                     important personages.</p>
                  <p>One was a celebrated clergyman, whose every remark was quoted, whose discourses
                     were published, and who, among his admirers, seemed altogether an oracle, the
                     commonest expression from his lips acquiring in their estimation a sacred "lo,
                     and behold!"</p>
                  <p>The other was an eminent lady philanthropist. Her wealth, which was immense,
                     she spent profusely in a broad, unbounded stream of charity. Her movements were
                     chronicled, her name was at the head of every benevolent project—its very sound
                     secured success. "And by Jove, sir!" cried Geoffrey, starting up in amazement
                     after the perusal of a long list of her charitable doings, "if it isn't aunt
                     Dupont! Why, sir, if any one had asked me the question, I should have said she
                     had no heart at all! So much for trusting to the prejudices of childhood! Here,
                     among the rest, is the Dupont Pensionary. It is said that she has endowed this
                     institution with a large amount, for the purpose of rearing orphan girls to
                     respectability and usefulness. That is an admirable idea, certainly. And here
                     are a number of other matters on which her money and time are freely bestowed.
                     Exemplary woman! Rises at six—listens to the reading of the daily reports
                     presented—after breakfast visits her various charges—looks over her accounts
                     after dinner—and spends the evening with her different functionaries in laying
                     plans for the next day's proceedings. What tireless zeal! Well, I will never
                     dare judge any one again. I was a little piqued to be sure," continued
                     Geoffrey, "at the note I received from her a few days after our arrival, in
                     which she regretted that the demands upon her time made it out of her power to
                     call upon her brother's son (those words do always so grate on my ear!) and
                     congratulate him on his safe return, but that she hoped to have the pleasure of
                     a visit from me when Ralph's health permitted his return to the city. Cold
                     welcome, I thought it, but I fully excuse her now. Ah!" exclaimed the young
                     man, with pleasant surprise, as he opened a note just handed him by the
                     servant, "here is something from Madeleine!"</p>
                  <p>Ralph and herself had just returned from their southern trip, and were both
                     exceedingly anxious to see their dear cousin Geoffrey. Ralph was unwell and
                     very much fatigued, would not their old companion waive all ceremony and come
                     to them tomorrow? "I will have the carriage at the cottage a few minutes before
                     twelve," the lady wrote, with the characteristic eagerness Geoffrey remembered
                     so well. "You will take luncheon with us—you will certainly come! A postscript
                     added inquiries for aunt Edith and the sweet girls, and—she would "die if he
                     didn't come!"</p>
                  <p>"And you must go, certainly," said Mr. Cranburn, "your aunt is so much better
                     that you may feel at ease, and I can surely endure to be left alone for a few
                     hours. I know you will be back as shortly as possible. You have been so
                     faithful to me, my dear boy," he added, in an almost tremulous voice, "and
                     denied yourself so much, that I can never forget it. But now I would be really
                     glad to have you enjoy this opportunity, and get away from this quiet house for
                     a little while."</p>
                  <p>On the next morning, punctual to the hour, the carriage was in waiting at the
                     door. A rich and elegant equipage, whose unostentatious mountings and livery
                     befitted those of old established place in society.</p>
                  <p>As they emerged from the grassy lane into the broad avenue, distant bells in
                     the city chimed the mid-day hour, and the road swarmed with swarthy workingmen
                     from the factories, foundries, and workshops that spread along the
                     water-suburbs of the great metropolis.</p>
                  <p>Passing swiftly from this busy scene of everyday life, through the bustling
                     thoroughfares of the city, they presently arrived where broad squares and wide
                     quiet streets indicated the aristocratic repose and elegance of wealth. Stately
                     mansions lined the way on either side. Before one of these, a large double
                     house of grave yet magnificent architecture, the carriage drew up, and preceded
                     by the footman Geoffrey ascended the high stone steps. The door was opened by a
                     pompous serving-man, who bowing silently to the young man's inquiries,
                     conducted him through the extensive hall, to a reception room at its extreme
                     end.</p>
                  <p>Involuntarily, as he followed this dignified personage over the velvet carpet,
                     Geoffrey assumed the same subdued step. In the general hush that pervaded the
                     place, he could not avoid the feeling that it would be an unseemly thing to
                     make a sound in the midst of such solemnity. As he took his seat in the
                     semi-darkened room, the silent serving man, with another low reverence,
                     received his card and departed.</p>
                  <p>The next twenty minutes seemed of marvelous length to Geoffrey,—he waited and
                     waited—no summons came. It occurred to him several times that if he had a
                     friend whom he had not seen for several years, he might not have been
                     sufficiently versed in etiquette to know that <emph>this</emph> was the way to
                     receive him! Pondering this useful but tedious lesson, he endeavored to beguile
                     the time by searching out some amusement. As his eyes became accustomed to the
                     duskiness of the apartment, he perceived that its walls were lofty, its ceiling
                     richly painted, and that it was ornamented with statues and pictures; but not
                     being able to distinguish anything save their outlines he received very little
                     edification from their inspection.</p>
                  <p>At last becoming utterly impatient, sitting there so still, perched in a
                     high-backed chair, in the center of the darkened room, he made an angry
                     movement in sheer restlessness; the stately chair responded with a terrible
                     creak which startled the visiter almost from his seat, it seemed to him as
                     though it would echo like a pistol through the silent house. But nothing
                     stirred—was there any one really in the building? He began to doubt if there
                     were. He looked about for a bell, or something by which he could announce his
                     presence, and summon some living thing to his rescue, but nothing was visible,
                     save the stately pieces of furniture; immoveable and silent as all else in that
                     dead house.</p>
                  <p>It was getting to be unbearable. Geoffrey looked at his speechless companions,
                     the chairs, with a sinister eye, being almost tempted to take one up, and smash
                     a window or mirror just for the pleasure of making a racket. It was evident
                     solitary confinement was not good for him. "Confound it!" he said, as he rose
                     and walked about, and had the satisfaction, at least, of hearing his own firm
                     step, as he placed it very decidedly on the thickly covered floor.</p>
                  <p>"Confound it! I would lose my reason very soon in such a place as this! The
                     very air is stifling—and what right have they to cage me here?"</p>
                  <p>Another twenty minutes passed.</p>
                  <p>"Now I'll go," said Geoffrey, "Not another minute will I wait." And he had
                     actually stepped towards the door, to put this threat into execution, when he
                     became conscious of a distant sound. A door was gently closed, as if on velvet
                     binges—then a step,—the same silent person appeared, and with a low bow of
                     grave meaning, made our impatient young gentleman aware that he was to follow,
                     and speechlessly ushered him into the drawing room, where the family were
                     gathered.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had not time to notice the magnificence of the apartment, for the
                     group he desired to meet were standing in its center. Madeleine, as he entered,
                     made a slight exclamation and a step forward, as though she would embrace him,
                     or grasp his hand, or do some natural thing of whose unnaturalness in that
                     great house she for the moment was forgetful. Speedily, however, the
                     recollection came to her, and she retreated as Ralph advanced and held out his
                     hand to the guest. Mrs. Dupont also expressed great pleasure at seeing him, but
                     Madeleine had not a word to say—it appeared as though it might be easier for
                     her to cry than speak.</p>
                  <p>Some reference was made to the length of time he had been kept waiting. Mrs.
                     Dupont had been engaged in her own room examining some matters that admitted of
                     no delay.</p>
                  <p>"Duty first, you know," she said, with a gracious inclination of her head
                        toward<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5590-00000063"/> Geoffrey. "We who intend
                     to fulfil our duties faithfully in this life, must expect to <choice>
                        <sic>facrifice</sic>
                        <corr>sacrifice</corr>
                     </choice> personal gratification."</p>
                  <p>"But where were the others all this while?" thought the young man, angrily.</p>
                  <p>"And although," continued the lady, complacently, there are but few who do
                     this, yet I find my only happiness in the performance of every duty. But I am
                     truly pleased to see you looking so well. "If our poor Ralph," looking at her
                     son's pale countenance, "could only enjoy such robust health!"</p>
                  <p>"Then he should travel—take it a little rough as I have had to," answered
                     Geoffrey, "and perhaps he would."</p>
                  <p>But we, who peep behind the curtain, scarcely think that he would; he wanted
                     the sanguine temperament of his cousin. In Ralph's colder, more concentrated
                     nature, everything he felt retained a distinctness which gave importance to the
                     smallest matters. A pain or an irritation that with the other would have been
                     speedily forgotten in some rush of fresh emotion, remained with him a fixed and
                     serious matter of fact not to be overlooked. Had he been obliged to exert
                     himself for a livelihood, and had others been dependent upon those exertions,
                     undoubtedly his conscientious sense of obligation would have led him in some
                     manner to forget himself for their sakes; and though this might not have been
                     to the extent of which many are capable, still he would have done his share,
                     for his was not one of those intensely selfish natures which in their joys and
                     sorrows think only of themselves. The recognition of justice and right were
                     really a predominant feature in this man's character. But apart from this, a
                     certain lack of warmth and emotion, gave a contracted intensity to his thoughts
                     and actions quite different from the free-hearted ease with which Geoffrey
                     flung himself into every varying phase of his life, living it with all the
                     fervor and capacity of his nature; yet possibly forgetting in the rapid passage
                     of new sensations the pains or pleasures of the last.</p>
                  <p>Ralph was not deficient in charitable action, but his was more the charity from
                     the head, not the heart. As a rich man, as one well known, it was his duty to
                     give to certain things, to support certain institutions. So he gave liberally,
                     in amounts so astounding that people opened their eyes with a wonder that made
                     them ashamed of their own doings. So to his family—to all who were dependent on
                     him, he gave as a gentleman of his wealth should. His house, his equipages were
                     sustained in the most magnificent style; but he obliged all those under his
                     influence to live in an atmosphere guided by his thermometer of feeling. There
                     were no spontaneous bursts of emotion allowable, no quick uncoverings of newly
                     awakened thought tolerated, all must move, live and be on the placid graduating
                     scale of the master mind, and as might be supposed under such circumstances,
                     many were impoverished even in the midst of seeming abundance, while others
                     fattened in the careless indifference of not troubling to think for
                     themselves.</p>
                  <p>He was, perhaps, constitutionally rather feeble, but he was not diseased. His
                     physical as well as mental stamina would no doubt have been robust with the
                     proper ventilation to toughen their fibre and sinew. His father had died while
                     still a young man, and he had become possessed with the idea that he was like
                     him in constitution, and must die early also, and now as he was nearing that
                     age, it cast a sort of funeral gloom over his life, stalking over the household
                     as a pestilence. Who could be merry or joyous when its master was under
                     sentence of doom? Ralph was not one of those who, in their humility, would not
                     consider themselves of so much importance that a world need mourn; or who would
                     draw aside and suffer unnoticed: no! he was a power that must be felt,—the only
                     reflection that would occur was how any one dare or could feel lightly in such
                     a state of things.</p>

                  <p>JUST as they were summoned to luncheon a lady entered the drawing-room who was
                     introduced to Geoffrey as Miss Arrowfield. She was very becomingly attired—more
                     elegantly than either of the other ladies. Although neither young nor handsome,
                     yet there was a grace and distinction about her that at once attracted <choice>
                        <sic>attentention</sic>
                        <corr>attention</corr>
                     </choice>. As she is to occupy quite a prominent place in the issue of this
                     narrative, it may interest the reader to have a short sketch of all that was
                     known of her.</p>
                  <p>About four or five years since Mrs. Dupont had advertised for an assistant in
                     her newly established Pensionary. This advertisement was answered by Eldred
                     Arrowfield, then a girl of twenty. From among many applicants the keen-sighted
                     Mrs. Dupont at once selected this then humble-looking young woman, on account
                     of the evidences of quickness and intelligence discerned by her practised eye.
                     And though in answer to her inquiries as to family and antecedents the lady
                     received very little satisfaction, yet the girl's manner was so frank, and she
                     was so well pleased with all she did say, that her usual suspicions were not
                     aroused, and for once in her life she acted more from feeling than from
                     judgment, and made an engagement on the spot.</p>
                  <p>The duties required of the new assistant at the Institute, were, to have a
                     general oversight of the establishment, attend to the girls, act as secretary
                     to Mrs. Dupont, and make herself generally useful; and a valuable auxiliary she
                     proved to be. It seemed as though she were indeed made for the task. Difficult
                     to please, and unappreciative as was Mrs. Dupont on general occasions, in this
                     instance she gave herself up to unqualified approbation, she was charmed,
                     delighted; time only revealed new features of excellence. "She is a very
                     genius," said the lady, to her son Ralph, "I almost feel to believe, my dear,
                     that a special providence, raised her to assist me in this great work."</p>
                  <p>Months and years went by, and still Eldred continued the same untiring, devoted
                     assistant, taking much of the labor and responsibility, and yet so managing it
                     that Mrs. Dupont received all the credit.</p>
                  <p>"Without you, my dear madam, to direct, to encourage, to give the benefit of
                     your large intelligence, what should I be? Well may I say, it is you, and you
                     alone that have done all this." Mrs. Dupont was gratified. The flattery was so
                     delicate, so skilfully administered, that it seemed the spontaneous gushing of
                     an overcharged heart.</p>
                  <p>There was but one thing to mar this perfect satisfaction, and that was in the
                     growing antipathy of the orphan girls of the Institute, which seemed to be
                     swelling to a perfect hatred for their young mistress. It might have been well,
                     and perhaps more just to have inquired if there was a sufficient cause for this
                     strange dislike, especially as it was so universal, but that was not like Mrs.
                     Dupont. Her mind moved in direct lines, and they were neither broad nor
                     comprehensive; she understood but little of human nature in all its varieties;
                     these young lives that she had undertaken to guide with all their varied needs,
                     were as a sealed book to her, neither had she that glowing warmth of affection
                     that would have softened down their roughnesses, and looked with lenience upon
                     their thoughtless acts; all with her must be ruled in the same way, by strict
                     uniform laws; she would listen to no complaints, indeed she could not
                     comprehend the right of persons utterly dependent to express dissatisfaction.
                     It was ungrateful, wicked, intolerable, and must be punished. So as a matter of
                     course the refractory spirits were by additional strictness brought to
                     submission, while she whom they regarded as their enemy was taken into greater
                     favor, as a martyr in the cause of humanity.</p>
                  <p>As the fame of the great Dupont Institute spread, and its numbers increased the
                     labors connected with the administration of<pb n="126-127"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000064"/> of its affairs be came much more arduous; there
                     was such an increase of writing; correspondence to be kept up, meetings called
                     records kept, internal accounts looked after—it was immense—Mrs. Dupont must
                     have Eldred for this one purpose. She must be her amanuensis, devoted to her
                     alone, and she must have her, too, with her at all hours in her home; so, to
                     the young lady's supreme delight, she became an inmate of Mr. Ralph
                     Luperthorp's splendid mansion. To be sure it was in an humble capacity she
                     entered its walls, but she knew her power, and was willing to bide her time. So
                     she busily employed herself from morning till night in her neat little room, so
                     inviting and orderly, with its white curtains and pretty chintz couches,
                     desiring apparrently nothing beyond its walls.</p>
                  <p>This was not indeed a happy household when Eldred entered it, and any change
                     seemed a relief to its restless young mistress. It must not be supposed that
                     Madeleine was ill-treated, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, or even
                     conscious of any injury; but she was unhappy,—her heart still craving for
                     something, she hardly knew what,—be it life, love, liberty, anything. The great
                     deficiency of her character was self-dependence; she needed the strength of
                     others, the kindness of others to support her. She was trusting, yielding, and
                     required sympathy and companionship even in everyday trifles. Mrs. Dupont was
                     altogether occupied with her own purposes, and Ralph lived entirely within
                     himself, having few interests outside of self, and expecting all other
                     interests to revolve around that same point, never for a moment dreaming that
                     he was unjust, or that it was unfair to demand this sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>So when Eldred came, with her bright, cheerful ways, it was indeed a godsend to
                     poor Madeleine, and the young wife soon began to enjoy a few moments spent now
                     and then in the hilarity of that pleasant room, and to visit it frequently,
                     sure to find Eldred ready with a bright smile and cheerful word that lifted the
                     gloom which was pervading the very atmosphere of her existence.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine had no near companions, only the dear girls at the cottage, and these
                     she seldom saw. She was devoted to her husband, and loved him truly; she sat
                     with him patiently, and talked or was silent, as he felt disposed. In the early
                     afternoons they usually rode out together; but this was not a pleasure-ride,
                     there was no talking or smiling, or looking to this side or that; these were
                     the state occasions, when the family presence and dignity were for a brief hour
                     aired before the public eye. There was also her extensive visiting list, which
                     on stated occasions occupied Madeleine's attention; but these were calls of
                     ceremony rather than friendship. So Eldred filled the vacancy, and seemed in a
                     measure to supply the great want.</p>
                  <p>There are few alas, on this earth, with whom it is safe to trust every thought,
                     yet Madeleine never dreamed, in the first flush of these new circumstances,
                     that there was any danger in disclosing the disappointments and desires of her
                     lonely life. Neither can it be supposed that this sympathy, this apparently
                     instinctive impulse to hush with the soothing accents of love every disturbing
                     influence or slightly-jarred emotion which the young wife innocently betrayed
                     to her new found friend, was altogether assumed, or that from the very first
                     Eldred deliberately planned the fearful results that followed. No, no, but she
                     was ambitious, vindictive, mischievous; all these little confidences so
                     thoughtlessly bestowed, forgotten in the relief their expression gave, were
                     treasured by her, and skilfully made use of as other circumstances transpired.
                     Indeed they seemed but trifles, and Madeleine would sometimes say with a laugh,
                     "Now that I have put forth all these grim fancies I am truly ashamed—there
                     seems to be nothing in them. It must have been in thinking over so much that
                     they acquired such distinct shape. Dear Ralph, who loves me so well, and dear
                     Mrs. Dupont, my benefactress, who has been as a mother to me! I ought truly to
                     be ashamed. But it is only to you, dear Eldred, only to you that I speak—you
                     have such an inviting, loving, way!"</p>
                  <p>With Eldred's usual good fortune she not only thus powerfully ingratiated
                     herself with the young mistress of the house; but soon following that all its
                     other prominent members were also as much interested; she was so pleasant and
                     daring in her agreeable way, Ralph would sometimes smile, and Mrs. Dupont would
                     nod her head graciously, and then there would be such pleasant times, the
                     shadows would seem truly to rise for a moment from that cold and formal
                     household.</p>
                  <p>And then she was so capable and thoughtful; did every thing right, and at the
                     right time; she was indeed an acquisition, and soon came to be a necessity, and
                     had everything mostly her own way. Not only was she Mrs. Dupont's dependent and
                     private secretary, but she was her fast friend also. Yet, although others were
                     satisfied, Eldred began to feel that she was not. The demon of ambition and
                     envy was coming in possession. She had gained her point so far, and there was
                     no reason why she should not go farther; was she not wiser, brighter, far
                     superior to that young wife, who could scarcely say her soul was her own? She
                     must be acknowledged her equal at any rate, she would not be this humble
                     friend, who must retreat under the gaze of their stately visiters, while the
                     grating sound would burn in her ear, in Ralph's grandest style, "Allow me to
                     present Mrs. Luperthorp this morning!" no, she must be all or nothing.</p>
                  <p>These growing feelings made her begin to hate Madeleine, to feel for her a
                     great contempt; still she was cautious, but withal Madeleine soon intuitively
                     felt her dislike. There was nothing done that would admit of explanation, she
                     was only distressed trying to imagine what could have occured, what she might
                     have done, and would redouble her attentions; it was of no use, they would be
                     met with bitterness, a scorn that was manifest to none but Madeleine, and yet
                     not even so manifest to her that she could take the proper steps to restrain
                     it. It was just in that position that when Madeleine, doubtful and troubled,
                     frankly said, "Eldred you are changed," she could answer, as if painfully
                     shocked, "Oh my friend, (may I use that endearing epithet?) I fear it is you
                     that are changed, or why should you imagine this?"</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless the consciousness that Madeleine was beginning to understand her,
                     increased this envious dislike into positive hatred, and made Eldred more
                     determined than ever to attain a position superior to her. But it was necessary
                     to use the greatest skill, it would not do to alarm either Ralph or Mrs.
                     Dupont; she knew that she herself would be sacrificed should she dare to raise
                     her voice against the mistress of that house. Nevertheless, in some strange,
                     mysterious way they came to know all the feelings which the young wife had
                     uttered. It was not by words, or in fact by any means which they could have
                     named, but they knew it just as well. A well timed shrug, a hint, an inuendo,
                     even an accent of pity will sometimes convey more than words. Poor Madeleine,
                     she was being woven in the meshes of a most intricate network, from which it
                     would be very difficult to disentangle herself. Small as her influence ever had
                     been, it grew still less. while the person who had so silently injured her rose
                     to the highest distinction; she was now supreme, though none save herself knew
                     that it was so; everything had been so natural, so gradual, it had all come
                     about as a matter of course.</p>
                  <p>Thus matters were when Geoffrey made his first visit to his cousin Ralph. He,
                     like others, was charmed with the lady, now universally recognized as Miss
                     Arrowfield, the intimate and bosom friend of the great Luperthorp family. She
                     was in the very zenith of her power; and it must be allowed that Geoffrey was
                     much relieved by her presence; it took away the stiffness. She was unceasing in
                     her efforts to please, and yet not officiously so, there was a winning grace of
                     manner that put all at their ease; she saw to every want; for Mrs. Dupont she
                     selected her favorite viands, for Ralph there was the exquisite little morsel
                     suited to his delicate taste; the guest could not be too much favored, and even
                     dear Mrs. Luperthorp was not overlooked, and<pb n="128-129"

                     </choice> be distracted by perhaps the opening of a door that might cause a
                     slight draught, then she was ready with some apropos question, that would
                     please and make him forget the interruption.</p>
                  <p>It was a rich apartment, this splendid dining-room, with its deep windows and
                     massive furniture, and the table glittering with its well-kept treasures of
                     sparkling silver and elegant cut-glass. When the fruit and jellies were brought
                     in, the little Madeleine entered with her nurse. She was at once taken to the
                     arms of Miss Arrowfield, who caressed her most lovingly, as she "showed off"
                     her graces to the new-found cousin.</p>
                  <p>"Do you think she resembles me?" said Madeleine, rather timidly, as the little
                     cherub face was smiling through its curls at dear Miss Eldred, who was picking
                     some nuts for the sweet darling, "Or rather," she said, in a deprecating tone,
                     "does she resemble me as I was in the old times?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey turned, and for the first time looked directly in Madeleine's face; he
                     felt as he looked at her thus that she had justly made that last reservation,
                     for she was altered, unmistakably much altered.</p>
                  <p>Hers was not a beauty to survive the rich coloring of youth, or the bright
                     sparkle of the young lithesome eye, and he was about to answer, laying his hand
                     on the child's bright head, "Here at least are the glossy, dancing ringlets of
                     the Madeleine of my early remembrance," when Miss Arrowfield exclaimed,</p>
                  <p>"Ah no, dear madam, she is all a Luperthorp! She has her grandmother's eyes, I
                     am sure, and her father's features, the little angel!" and again she embraced
                     the fairy little creature with rapturous warmth.</p>
                  <p>"It is a strange infatuation;" said Mrs. Dupont to Geoffrey, in her usual slow,
                     emphatic way, "Madeleine will have persons say that child resembles her."</p>
                  <p>"But, dear Mrs. Dupont," spoke Miss Arrowfield, in a half pitying, half
                     apologetic tone, "this desire is so natural."</p>
                  <p>"And why she should thus persist," said Ralph, now roused to a little
                     fluttering energy, "when she has been so repeatedly told otherwise, is
                     remarkable. And indeed Madeleine," he still continued, now addressing his wife
                     with increasing severity, "you do injustice to your guests by such frivolous
                     questions, and I must say that they are far from pleasant to me. So spare me,
                     if you please. The subject may be very interesting to you, but it would perhaps
                     be as well to remember that it may not be as much so to others."</p>
                  <p>Madeleine did not answer, but Geoffrey saw, even though he tried not to see,
                     the pale face and trembling lip of the silent woman, and a perfect fury of rage
                     came over him; he longed to level that sneering, insolent cousin of his to the
                     dust. "Aye! at your old tricks, Ralph! I know them well," he muttered to
                     himself, "these exasperating assumptions of superior wisdom. I wish she knew
                     you as I do. But it is better not, else I would tell her what a weak fellow you
                     are,—that she is worth a dozen of you, that you are a fool, that you cannot see
                     an inch before your nose, that she could trip you up any day, either mentally
                     or <choice>
                        <sic>physcially</sic>
                        <corr>physically</corr>
                     </choice>!" All this and much more was rapidly passing through his brain, as he
                     sat there trying to seem interested in the plate of bonbons before him.</p>
                  <p>In Ralph though, there was quite a change. After this little outburst he seemed
                     considerably relieved, and became unusually animated. He wanted to hear of
                     Geoffrey's travels, of the places he had visited.</p>
                  <p>"Oh do let us hear all about them, it will be so delightful!" said Miss
                     Arrowfield with enthusiasm. Even Madeleine's flush of mortification disappeared
                     as she exclaimed "Oh do, Geoffrey!" A pleasant hour was passed, and Ralph
                     forgot himself for a brief moment, in the pleasure of listening.</p>
                  <p>"And you think, Geoffrey, it would do me good to travel?"</p>
                  <p>"I'm sure of it!" responded his cousin, heartily, "It would make a strong man
                     of you," and he might have added, a wiser man; you would then find your level,
                     and where you belonged, as the merest unit in the world's vast creation.</p>
                  <p>Ralph soon, however returned to himself, and leaned back in his chair,
                     expressing much exhaustion from the unusual excitement. Miss Arrowfield was
                     prompt in pouring out a cordial into a delicate little glass, holding it in the
                     warmth of her hand until it acquired a certain degree of heat, then handing it
                     to Mrs. Dupont to administer to her son. He swallowed the beverage. "This is so <choice>
                        <sic>thoughful</sic>
                        <corr>thoughtful</corr>
                     </choice>!" he said reviving.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey now looking at his watch, hastily arose and said he must be off at
                     once, he had not known it was so late.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, do not go yet!" said Madeleine, in her old, eager way, "I have been so
                     delighted, so happy in listening to you."</p>
                  <p>"And, indeed, so have we all," interposed Miss Arrowfield.</p>
                  <p>"But do not go quite yet!" still urged Madeleine.</p>
                  <p>"My dear," said Mrs. Dupont, with that bland sternness of rebuke she knew so
                     well how to assume, "my nephew is the best judge of what he should do; I beg
                     you will be more considerate. Time may be of little value to you, but remember
                     it is not so to all others."</p>
                  <p>Madeleine bit her lips angrily. She was more disposed to rebellion this day
                     than she had ever been before, still she was silent and smiled again pleasantly
                     as he was going away.</p>
                  <p>When Geoffrey was saying good bye to his aunt Dupont, he received a pressing
                     invitation to attend the semi-annual examination of the young beneficiaries of
                     the Dupont Institute, which was to take place on the following week. "You will
                     then," added she, "have an opportunity to see some of the effects of my arduous
                     labors, in the intelligence and culture of these orphans, once degraded girls,"
                     and to Geoffrey's remark that it was a most laudable work, she answered, "It is
                     not, you understand, for myself I do this; it is for my family, my race; I even
                     contemplate dropping the familiar name of Dupont as bestowed upon this
                     cherished institution, and substituting that of Luperthorp. I feel that my son
                     and his inheritors should have the honor—I am willing to die and be forgotten!"
                     she added with a sublime devotion.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear Mrs. Dupont!" exclaimed Miss Arrowfield, with emotion, "do not speak
                     thus, do not, I entreat! How could you be forgotten?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did not go away favorably impressed; but why he should feel as he did
                     he could hardly tell. "It may be," thought he, "but a revival of my old
                     prejudices. I will not be so unfair as to allow myself to be governed by them.
                     They were all kind to me—that is in their way—and I must see more of them." He
                     resolved that he would attend this examination at the Dupont Institute, and
                     that he would make a strong effort to overcome this unreasonable repugnance to
                     his aunt Dupont, which had grown with his growth, and fastened on his manhood
                     so that he could not shake it off; she was to him still the same weak, pompous,
                     one idea individual of his childhood; but he would strive to judge fairly, she
                     had certainly done much, sacrificed a great deal, and people were loud in their
                     praise; let the present time guide his judgment, he would begin again and form
                     his belief.</p>
                  <p>But he was glad to be roused from these musings, and to get sight again of that
                     little cottage embosomed among the willows, as it rested so quietly in the
                     clear afternoon sun; here all was peace. In its society he lost that
                     combativeness that seemed to keep him restless and defying, as if wasting with
                     some phantom wrong, as if some bubble ruled, and right and justice were
                     trampled under foot.</p>
                  <p>He was met at the door by Mr. Cranburn, who was in high spirits; aunt Edith had
                     been pronounced out of danger, and her husband might be with her, "and so may
                     you, Geoffrey, my boy, if we will be very silent and behave ourselves
                     properly!"</p>
                  <p>For a week or more after this Mr. Cranburn and Geoffrey made a daily visit to
                     the invalid, and were permitted to press her hand and whisper a few words;
                     gradually the favor was increased, till the elder gentleman came to sit almost
                     constantly by his<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5590-00000066"/> wife's bedside,
                     and to declare he would no be put from it.</p>
                  <p>Thus the young ladies were much relieved of attendance on their charge, and
                     Geoffrey began to live again in the felicity of their society.</p>
                  <p>He had spent enough time in dreams and visions, and evening wanderings in the
                     little garden under that window with the pale light—he wanted now to gaze
                     without interruption on the ever varying beauty of that face which had been for
                     so many weary days shut from his sight. But he was pained and alarmed when he
                     found that once brilliant complexion pale and colorless as the drooping lily.
                     Not but Cecilia appeared even more lovely; but that she should suffer, and in
                     such a cause; that she had exhausted her strength and energy in devotion to his
                     own dear aunt Edith! Why it would justify the most extravagant sacrifices on
                     his part, it was only duty, gratitude! She must have out-door exercise,
                     horseback riding—walking, driving anything to keep her in the fresh air! When
                     of course a series of attentions began which occupied the greater portion of
                     each day.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was now so far recovered, that at her desire her sick-chair was
                     wheeled into the family apartment, where she ate her meals, and spent her
                     evenings with them all. Mr. Cranburn never left her, but too happy in watching
                     over her, every sense being absorbed in this delightful solicitude.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey, although sensible of a deep debt of gratitude to both the young
                     ladies for their earnest care of his best friend, yet seemed unable to carry
                     any manifestation of it beyond the fair girl on whom he was in constant
                     attendance; indeed, he was so absorbed in his devotion that he seemed to have
                     no eyes or ears for anything else.</p>
                  <p>Still he took great pleasure in talking to Cecilia of her eccentric companion,
                     as he was pleased to style the reserved and in-communicative Ilia. Was
                     certainly much obliged, he would say, and interested—and he even went so far as
                     to request Cecilia to invite the young lady to accompany them in one of their
                     morning drives, which honor the ungrateful recipient at once promptly declined,
                     and that satisfied him. "I have done all I can. I have not yet told you," he
                     said confidentially to his companion, "of the time when I came unexpectedly
                     upon her, as she sat in the summer house over the spring, and fancying from her
                     appearance that she had either been weeping or was in trouble, I spoke to her
                     with real pity and interest, asking if she was unwell, or if there was anything
                     I could do for her,—when she arose abruptly, and without a word of thanks for
                     my sympathy, said she was perfectly well, and left me. She <emph>is</emph> an
                     eccentric girl. You cannot make me believe anything else," he continued, "I do
                     not think I shall trouble her any more with my attentions."</p>
                  <p>"You do not know her!" answered Cecilia warmly, "if you did, you could not but
                     be interested in her, and love her, she is so generous and good!"</p>
                  <p>"Well I do not care" said the young man with indifference, "to trouble myself
                     about those who are so difficult to find out. Especially," he added with a
                     bow," when those are near whose soul-speaking thoughts are transparent as the
                     pure blush that heralds them!"</p>
                  <p>Cecilia colored; but she was not to be put aside from her championship, and she
                     answered bravely, "You are indeed mistaken, Ilia is not difficult to
                     understand, she is all frankness truth and simplicity."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey shrugged his shoulders with a rather incredulous significance.</p>
                  <p>"I would not wish to contradict my fair <choice>
                        <sic>anatagonist</sic>
                        <corr>antagonist</corr>
                     </choice>," he returned, with a smile; "but such, I must say, has not been my
                     experience with the young lady."</p>
                  <p>"But you know," said Cecilia still endeavoring to vindicate her friend, yet
                     hesitating, as though there might be something she ought not to say, and
                     therefore it were better not to reply at all. "You know there are some whose
                     every circumstance of life forbids openness and candor."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, but you would hardly connect such persons with frankness, and high
                     honor."</p>
                  <p>"Now you misunderstand me," she exclaimed quite perplexed, "I mean when it is
                     not of their own fault—when they cannot help it—when it seems as their fate or
                     destiny; but I hardly know what I am saying, perhaps I have said too much."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey noticed her embarrassment and tried to smile it away, remarking
                     carelessly "Oh you have undertaken a hard case; the young lady may be to those
                     who know her everything that is desirable, but to me she has always been silent
                     capricious, and wonderfully mysterious!"</p>
                  <p>Cecilia was vexed. Perhaps she had said too much or too little, or something
                     wrong, and she showed this disturbance in her sweet face.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind" said the young man with much tenderness in his tone, "your
                     generous affection for her will obliterate a number of my own antipathies. I
                     shall endeavor to do the amiable to your friend, on your account."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, I shall not be satisfied till you love her for her sake."</p>
                  <p>"Well, well we will see," he answered gallantly, as he assisted the beautiful
                     girl to mount her spirited pony, which had been some time waiting. This
                     graceful and well trained animal was a present from Mr. Cranburn to the young
                     lady, as a slight acknowledgment for her affectionate devotion to his wife.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey and his companion now gaily cantered away, full of happy life and
                     anticipation.</p>
                  <p>But with all Cecilia had said, Ilia was not the person she had been. She was
                     really becoming an enigma to her best friends. Aunt Edith had noticed the
                     change, but attributed it to the great nervous tension and fatigue she had
                     undergone during her long attendance in the sick room. She had entreated Ilia
                     affectionately to rest and strive to recruit; but the fitful girl would not
                     listen to any suggestions. She would only answer sharply that she wondered she
                     could not be let alone, when she did not trouble any body, and then perhaps the
                     next moment she would throw her arms around aunt Edith, sob, and cry, and beg
                     to be forgiven, "Oh do forgive me, dear, best friend! I cannot control myself
                     at times. I am wicked, bad—and oh, I am sick, sick at heart, would that I could
                     die!"</p>
                  <p>And when aunt Edith, in alarm, insisted that something must be done—that help
                     must be had immediately,—the unhappy girl, in a perfect frenzy of despair,
                     would beg and plead so piteously, that the kind lady to quiet her was obliged
                     to promise silence, and that she would never allude to the subject again, or
                     even allow herself to imagine there was anything the matter.</p>
                  <p>How long Ilia stood, gazing after that young couple, as they rode gaily away on
                     that warm summer afternoon, waking the echoes with laugh and jest, in the
                     solitude of that shaded green lane! She was standing at the little window of
                     that chamber high in the eaves, "the dove's nest," as Geoffrey laughingly
                     designated their tiny apartment. She could see them in their gay, graceful
                     abandonment, cantering on, till the wooded roadside hid them from her view;
                     then she turned bitterly away, and paced up and down the little dormitory she
                     knew not how long; there was such an agonising thought in that poor heart that
                     it seemed to absorb all time and recollection. At length she paused before the
                     mirror, shaded with its long lace covering. "Ah," sighed she, "there are no
                     roses to pale on this dark cheek, and who cares whether I am sick or well?"
                     Long she stood there, brooding and moody, gazing absently at the figure dimly
                     reflected before her. The evening shades began to gather round her, and still
                     she stood, even till the gay voice of Cecilia roused her from her
                     abstraction.</p>
                  <p>"What! moving up here all alone, Ilia, what is this for?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," answered Ilia, bitterly, "I am indeed alone. Who cares to be with the
                     ugly, unprepossessing, repulsive Ilia?" and as she repeated these words she
                     fell into a hysterical fit of weeping.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Ilia," exclaimed her astonished friend, "what <emph>can</emph> be the
                     matter? This is so unlike you—you that take everything so philosophically! What
                     has changed you lately?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I am changed," answered Ilia, in<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5590-00000067"
                     /> a calmer voice; "so changed I hardly know myself. I hate, I despise myself,
                     and if I cannot get rid of this mean, contemptible spirit, I will take my own
                     life!"</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, you frighten me!" cried Cecilia, with a started voice.</p>
                  <p>"I do not wonder. Sit down by me, Cecilia, and with your sweet voice talk this
                     bitter, unmanageable spirit out of me; you have often done this before. I try
                     to curb these passions, to make myself loveable—but somehow I fail. There is
                     something," and she shuddered, "that ever comes in my way. I want to be loved.
                     You cannot understand this, Cecilia, you who are so worshipped wherever you go;
                     but there is such a craving intensity of desire for it, that it seems to have
                     fastened upon my very life!"</p>
                  <p>"And don't we all love you, dear?" said the young comforter, tenderly. "Ilia,
                     we do all love you, with the truest love."</p>
                  <p>"I know it, and it is more than I ought to ask. I am ashamed and humbled to the
                     dust, when I think of all you have been to me, of your efforts for me, of your
                     untiring patience and magnanimity. You have so long known me, all about me, and
                     yet you take me to your heart as a sister. When I think of these things,
                     Cecilia, then I feel my littleness of soul, and my deep ingratitude, and I do
                     not wonder that people turn from me, and shun me, when my very spirit shows
                     repulsive and misshapen as my form and face!"</p>
                  <p>"But you are not any of these things!" spoke out quickly the affectionate
                     Cecilia. 'You will have it so, Ilia," she continued still more earnestly, "and
                     it is not fair. None of us here think so; we all love to look on you. There is
                     life and intelligence in your face and eyes; mine may be of finer form and
                     color, but yours express the strength of the intellect. I am handsome, I
                     suppose; it must be so, as all tell me so; but my beauty is like a fine
                     landscape, attracting the passing eye by a happy combination of graceful form
                     and glowing tint; yours is that grander effect which no trick of art can
                     reach,—the light underlies the whole, the illumination is from within—it is
                     like a flash of sunlight from an opening cloud—it comes from Nature's studio,
                     and before it all else must pale. There!" said she laughing, "you see you have
                     made me quite eloquent!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Cecilia, stop! You are too generous, too forgiving,—you overwhelm me with
                     your partial judgments. Oh that I were all your kind indulgence would have me,
                     but I am not, I cannot be—I am full of these selfish complainings born of
                     vanity. I talk of humility, but if I were humble, I would think every minute,
                     day and hour of my life that I have a thousand-fold more than my deserts. What
                     am I? Oh Cecilia, when I think of this, and what I might have been, my
                     ingratitude seems too black!" and Ilia covered her face with her hands. "And I
                     have been envious, too," she said, suddenly raising her head, "and of you,
                     Cecilia! What could have changed me so, I that have always gloried in your
                     matchless beauty? But it is now over—I have found out the cause of this evil
                     influx, and by my life it shall be conquered."</p>
                  <p>Cecilia looked in wonder at this girl, now all agitated with emotion, and could
                     not understand this depth and intensity of feeling; the occasion did not seem
                     to warrant it, there was something beyond that she could not comprehend. Ilia
                     had always been so frank with her, confided to her even every unformed thought,
                     and now there was a kind of mystery, a something she could not reach, and all
                     she could do in her kind solicitude was to cheer and encourage her out of this
                     crushed self-condemning mood.</p>
                  <p>"As I was saying, Ilia," she began, "you are neither ugly nor repulsive.—far
                     from it. But you have faults you might mend; you are too sensitive and proud;
                     you imagine a great deal. People have to make all the advances, till they
                     become tired, and begin to think perhaps you are indifferent to their regard.
                     Our cousin Geoffrey has this idea,—he does not understand you—so I told
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"You are a dear, good girl, Cecilia," said the impetuous one, with a warm
                     embrace, "and I will not trouble you any more. I will try so hard to be
                     reasonable and just, like yourself in all things! And now Cecilia, I have but
                     one more thing to ask of you, will you leave me here, and go down stairs to
                     dear aunt Edith? Make it seem as nothing strange that I should stay up here. I
                     want this one evening by myself to devote to the interment of the old Ilia. You
                     will find me in the morning all renewed, ready to commence a new career."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DUPONT CHARITIES.</head>
                  <p>EARLY on the bright June morning of the morrow Ilia arose: the shadow had
                     passed from her: she was natural, self-possessed, and unconstrained as of
                     old.</p>
                  <p>None knew the contest through which she had passed in the solitude of that
                     weary night. None knew the burning tears she had shed, praying and struggling,
                     now in despair, now in hope that she might regain the mastery of herself, and
                     recover her own self-respect. Like the plant lucchina, which quiet, unnoticed,
                     creeps and creeps, until gradually its twisted fibres occupy the whole field
                     where it germinated, leaving no room for the growth of shrub or tree, and
                     crowding out all other vegetation—so this subtile passion had grown with her
                     growth, had spread its unseen roots, and taken firm hold of the imagination and
                     romance of her ardent nature, till it threatened to exclude every other
                     sentiment and thought.</p>
                  <p>But Ilia was strong; and being strong she triumphed. As she sat quietly down to
                     the breakfast table, and entered pleasantly into conversation, no one could
                     have surmised that anything had disturbed her serenity of mind. Unusually
                     animated, she unconsciously displayed the rare resourses of her fine intellect
                     in every expressive word and gesture.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was charmed; he had heard her speak but a few occasional words
                     hitherto. Her voice was unusually musical, and her thoughts seemed to him so
                     fresh and new and her manner so engaging, he was sorry when the meal was over,
                     and the ladies departed to their morning occupations.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith continued to improve; she could now walk about the room, resting on
                     her husband's arm, and even on the little porch, varying the journey
                     occasionally by an airing on the smooth green grass in front of the cottage.
                     Matters thus began to assume their natural course. Ilia, the only one who had
                     occupation apart from the others, resumed the regular duties that had been
                     interrupted by aunt Edith's illness, leaving the house every morning
                     immediately after breakfast, and not returning until dusk.</p>
                  <p>"Do you always wear black?" said Geoffrey, one morning as she was putting on
                     the sombre cloak and bonnet which always accompanied these expeditions. This
                     remark was made more to have something to say to the reserved girl, than
                     anything else, "And have you lost a friend?" he added, "Was it a near
                     relative?"</p>
                  <p>She looked confused, and did not raise her eyes as she answered, "No"—Yes."
                     Then, lifting her glance to his in its clear truthfulness, she said with
                     decision, "Yes, I have a dear, a very near friend—buried—entombed!" and with a
                     quick movement she drew the dark vail over her face, as if to hide strong
                     emotion, and walked hurriedly away, leaving Geoffrey wondering, yet pained that
                     his thoughtlessness should have led him unwittingly to probe this hidden
                     wound.</p>
                  <p>"Entombed," she had said—it was an expression he could not banish from his
                     mind. On meeting Cecilia he spoke of it to her, but she did not enlighten him,
                     and seemed rather desirous of changing the conversation. When he still
                     continued his inquiries, and finally asked outright where Ilia went every day,
                     Cecilia's bright color became crimson, and she stammered and hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I beg your pardon!" said Geoffrey, "If there is any secret about it of
                     course I have not another word to say."</p>
                  <p>"There is no secret about it, no indeed!"<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000068"/> said the embarrassed and blushing girl, "Every
                     one might know it—every one ought to know it! But—but—only I would wish first
                     to speak to Ilia herself."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said Geoffrey, laughing, "I think you said there was no mystery in all
                     this, Cecilia! what do you say now!"</p>
                  <p>They soon forgot all about it, however; it passed from their minds as things
                     are apt to pass with happy young people having few cares, and fresh for
                     enjoyment. Mounting their waiting steeds they galloped away, soon overtaking
                     Ilia as she walked wearily along. They passed her with a laughing good bye,
                     flung gayly behind them as they rushed onward.</p>
                  <p>Insensibly, however, notwithstanding Geoffrey's predisposition to find fault
                     with whatever was not pleasing to his eye, or capable of feeding his exacting
                     sense of beauty, Ilia began to hold a large place in his interest. He found
                     himself longing for those pleasant evenings, when in conversation or reading
                     she held so prominent a part. He seemed to have two beings, as it were, one
                     loving to sit beside the beautiful Cecilia and feel the power of her winning
                     charms, the other loving equally to listen to the sweet tones of Ilia's voice,
                     and float off on its <choice>
                        <sic>muscial</sic>
                        <corr>musical</corr>
                     </choice> cadences to some far off realm of imagination. There was a sort of
                     inner and outer consciousness becoming equally fascinating, in which he
                     revelled and lived.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cranburn, now that things were working so smoothly and harmoniously,
                     proposed to resume his own name, which as the reader may have conjectured, had
                     been laid aside during his exile, because in the intensity of his wounded
                     feelings he had desired to part company with everything connected with the
                     past.</p>
                  <p>"But now," said he, "I wish it restored. Aunt Edith and I were married in that
                     name, and it is right we should be known by it."</p>
                  <p>"What is the new name!" asked the young people, eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"Weldon. So now, as you are all to be my children, henceforth, as well as aunt
                     Edith's, you must call me uncle Weldon.</p>
                  <p>All kissed the good man's hand most lovingly, and said so it should be,—he
                     should ever be their dear uncle Weldon, related, as was aunt Edith, by ties of
                     affection and sympathy closer than those or blood. She might wear her new name
                     to others, but she must always be aunt Edith to them!"</p>
                  <p>"And to me, too," said her husband, as he wiped away the tears of affection
                     that filled his wife's eyes as she gazed on her beloved group.</p>
                  <p>"And we have resolved," said he cheerily, "my wife and I, to change our style
                     of living. I have abundant wealth, and I feel disposed to use it freely."</p>
                  <p>All now tumultuously disclaimed against the idea of leaving the cottage.</p>
                  <p>"I understand your partialities," said Mr. Weldon, "and I shall have some
                     regrets myself. But we should work a little for the future. We and you should
                     take our place in society. In this great country, where caste should be
                     abolished, and the only distinction be that of virtue and intelligence, we
                     ought all to be striving upward. Humility is desirable, and the humility which
                     makes us know ourselves justly, and prevents our claiming an unwise superiority
                     over our fellow men, is admirable indeed—but I like ambition, the ambition
                     which urges us on to the highest we can attain. Such an ambition no upright
                     mind need fear. It can legitimately pursue its course without injuring any,
                     while it lifts up those less strong to its own level."</p>
                  <p>"These are my sentiments exactly," said Geoffrey, warmly.</p>
                  <p>"And mine too," said Ilia, with enthusiasm, "Every one ought to know
                     themselves—to be conscious of all that is in them, and to raise these qualities
                     to their highest point of elevation!"</p>
                  <p>"Then, in consideration of these weighty arguments we are to have the new
                     house,' said Mr. Weldon with a touch of his quiet humor. "I have all the
                     strength on my side."</p>
                  <p>Much amusement ensued over the discussion of plans and arrangements. Aunt Edith
                     was to take a little pleasure journey this summer, accompanied by her husband,
                     and on their return the young folks were to have a short recreation in the
                     country. In the fall, when all were together again, the change of residence
                     could be made.</p>
                  <p>One bright morning Geoffrey accompanied by Cecilia set out to attend the
                     examination at the Dupont Institute, for which Mrs. Dupont had sent them cards
                     of invitation.</p>
                  <p>They arrived early at the noble looking building, whose spacious halls and wide
                     stairways were not as yet thronged with visiters.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont, they were told was then engaged with the lady managers, but if
                     they would step into her private office, they might await her coming.</p>
                  <p>In a few minutes she appeared, all graciousness and smiles, and expressed great
                     pleasure at seeing them.</p>
                  <p>"Mine is a busy life," she added, after her salutation, "without much time to
                     enjoy the peaceful repose of home. But I give it freely, I have long ceased to
                     live for myself, and mine shall not at any rate be a half-way offering. But why
                     should I speak thus, it is but my duty—those of our wealth and family position
                     have great responsibilities to sustain, and these shall not suffer by my
                     neglect. The poor we have always with us, and those who are respectable, I
                     shall endeavor to my utmost ability to encourage."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey listened attentively, and as he stood, hat in hand by the side of his
                     dignified relative, he could not but admit there was something tangible in all
                     this, although those monotonous, measured tones as usual jarred against his
                     ear. Generally speaking he had been always impatient when his aunt in her
                     formal way was "delivering" herself, as it were, because there had always arose
                     the feeling that there was nothing in it; but now he could not feel so. Still,
                     he kept his eyes fixed on the white polished floor; he could not bear to look
                     into those cold hard eyes that seemed so strangely at variance with all she was
                     saying; but he determinedly kept down all these stray thoughts, true to his
                     resolution to judge impartially in regard to his aunt.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia and he were requested to wait awhile, it was rather early, and some
                     business was to be transacted. They rose to leave, but were desired not to do
                     so, as the matter was of little importance, and would be speedily despatched
                     when Miss Arrowfield, who was occupied in another part of the building,
                     returned.</p>
                  <p>As the young people sat, patiently waiting, they observed two plainly dressed
                     females sitting inside the railing in front of Mrs. Dupont's high desk; they
                     appeared to be waiting also. Presently Miss Arrowfield came, followed by a maid
                     servant carrying a couple of heavy folios. The lady was most happy to meet
                     Geoffrey again. The recognition between Cecilia and herself was rather distant
                     and formal.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont at once proceeded to business. "Miss Arrowfield will you please to
                     occupy your seat?"</p>
                  <p>She sat down in front of a desk beside Mrs. Dupont's more elevated one.</p>
                  <p>"Now," said Mrs. Dupont, with an inclination of her head toward the two women,
                     one of whom stepped forward.</p>
                  <p>"You wish to place a young person in this institution. Will you allow me to ask
                     you a few questions?" The woman answered affirmatively.</p>
                  <p>"Is she a relative of yours?"</p>
                  <p>"No, madam."</p>
                  <p>"Does placing her in this institution serve any purpose of your own."</p>
                  <p>"No ma'am, it is only a promise I made to her poor mother, just now dead and
                     gone, that I would do this; that is true, I can assure you."</p>
                  <p>"Your simple avowal is enough;" said Mrs. Dupont, rather severely, "these
                     asseverations do not strengthen the case."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! only—only—" said the woman, quite confused.</p>
                  <p>"We will proceed," said Mrs. Dupont, with a wave of her hand silencing all
                     interruption. "Miss Arrowfield, open at page twenty-one. Read aloud the
                     necessary qualifications."</p>
                  <p>"Age must be over twelve years."</p>
                  <p>"Yes ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"Of respectable parentage."</p>
                  <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5590-00000069"/>
                  <p>"So, she is."</p>
                  <p>"Both parents must be of undoubted reputation."</p>
                  <p>"Ah me! the poor father was in his last days rather unfortunate, and took to
                     bad practises."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Arrowfield note this down, and still proceed."</p>
                  <p>"The girls must have attended school, and from that school bring credentials of
                     character and capacity."</p>
                  <p>"But, ma'am, she never was put to school. Her mother was a fine scholar, and
                     taught her at home, and of late years, poor woman, she had to keep the little
                     girl hard at work to help them earn a living."</p>
                  <p>"Again, Miss Arrowfield, you will make a memorandum, and proceed."</p>
                  <p>"The applicant must possess a good wardrobe," enumerating the different
                     articles needed.</p>
                  <p>"Dear ma'am!" interrupted the woman, "where would she get all these things?
                     Why, she has hardly a covering to her back!"</p>
                  <p>"Then we may as well dismiss the application. The petitioner fails altogether
                     in the necessary requirements."</p>
                  <p>"But ma'am," was the anxious reply, "would you not this time pass some of them
                     by? It made her mother happy in her dying hour to think that she would be cared
                     for here."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry, but it is altogether against our rules;" said Mrs. Dupont, "if we
                     swerve from them once we may at all times. I am sorry, but it must be so."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, do let me entreat!" said the woman, imploringly.</p>
                  <p>"It is of no use."</p>
                  <p>"What will I do with her? If I was able I'd keep her myself, but I'm a poor
                     woman, hardly able to get my own bread, what then shall I do with her?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont was immoveable as a rock. She prided herself on this inflexible
                     determination. "My answer is final," she said, with the grandest movement of
                     her head, "You will retire, others are waiting."</p>
                  <p>The other woman now approached with sadly discouraged air; she felt that her
                     case was hopeless. It was to request the restoration of one of the
                     beneficiaries of the institute who had been dismissed for misconduct.</p>
                  <p>"What are the written charges?" inquired Mrs. Dupont, turning to Miss
                     Arrowfield.</p>
                  <p>"They are on page ninety-six, Eliza D—.First. Laughed at prayers. Second. Put
                     out her tongue at Miss Arrowfield's back. Third. Was generally
                     disrespectful.</p>
                  <p>"This is an aggravated case. Disrespect to solemn observances."</p>
                  <p>"But she is now penitent."</p>
                  <p>"Disrespect to superiors."</p>
                  <p>"May there not be sometimes such provocation that it may be a little excuse,
                     Miss Arrowfield?"</p>
                  <p>"Allow me to interrupt you," said the lady president, sternly, "we never hear
                     complaints."</p>
                  <p>"There is general disrespect."</p>
                  <p>"She is young, though, and giddy, and thoughtless, and promises to do better,
                     might she not be forgiven?"</p>
                  <p>"It is against our rules."</p>
                  <p>"The institution must be kept unsullied. I will be obliged to dismiss the
                     subject."</p>
                  <p>"This is cruel," now said the woman, with some little temper, "you have it all
                     your way; it pleases you to have this little by-play; you cannot be injured,
                     but you can injure such a helpless creature as this by dismissing her from
                     here. Who will take her or have her with such a spot on her character?"</p>
                  <p>"The hour for public exercises has arrived," said Mrs. Dupont, rising.</p>
                  <p>"At least, madam," said the woman, persistently, "you will give her a line
                     saying that her dismissal was for a childish, simple offence."</p>
                  <p>The lady answered with decision as she was preceding her guests to the upper
                     room, "It is against the rules."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was hardly now in a fit state to mind to judge dispassionately or
                     enjoy the really interesting exercises that were about to take place; the only
                     calming influence about it, and that kept him within bounds, was the impression
                     that had just come to him, that his aunt Dupont was perfectly insensible as to
                     what she had done. If he thought she knew, he felt as though he would denounce
                     her to the whole world; but as he looked at the calm, satisfied air that was
                     now stealing over her features, he almost conceived she was unconscious, as is
                     the piece of machinery that has been dealing death and suffering around of the
                     wounds it inflicts.</p>
                  <p>There was a vast assemblage in that spacious room. This was a fashionable
                     charity, and the elite of the city were there. Among those on the raised
                     platform who were to take a prominent part, was Ralph, with many other well
                     known gentlemen. Miss Arrowfield was also conspicuous there with her books and
                     papers, seated by the lady patronesses.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont bore her honors well; right regal she looked, seated on her chair
                     of state; any other woman would have shrunk in dismay before these laudatory
                     speeches that were, directed towards her. Poor Madeleine, seated beside her,
                     trembled and turned scarlet, then pale, and then nearly fainted; but she bore
                     up bravely and secretly received great praise for that equanimity which showed
                     she was full of the grandeur of the work, not its outside surroundings.</p>
                  <p>The girls performed their parts most creditably. It was Ralph's place to
                     address them, and thank them for what they had done, and to remind them of
                     their duties, and what they owed to those who had given them this means of
                     distinction. Some of their instructors were named, and great praise bestowed;
                     one was alluded to, not named; but all knew who was meant—as they instinctively
                     turned their eyes to Miss Arrowfield—who was above all praise. She was the one,
                     under the watchful supervision of the its great head, by whom all this
                     excellence was "created."</p>
                  <p>Ralph was much excited by his effort and could not bear any more conversation;
                     he went home in his mother's carriage, with that lady and Miss Arrowfield, and
                     left Madeleine with the barouche to drive Cecilia and Geoffrey to the
                     cottage.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine seemed like herself, all joy and life again, "I am so glad,
                     Geoffrey," she said, "to have a chance to speak with you. There is an hour and
                     a half yet," looking at her watch, "before I need be home, so we will have a
                     drive out on the soft road, and then we can have such a delightful chat, we
                     three without any noise, and we can say and do just as we please,—can't we
                     Cecilia? You are not critical Geoffrey, like Ralph, are you? You let people be
                     foolish sometimes, and say wise or unwise things, but poor Ralph is so nervous,
                     every thing jars so painfully those delicate sensibilities of his that I almost
                     dread to speak before him."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey laughed, "Well Madeleine, you may feel perfectly secure with me, I do
                     not know that I have any nerves in that way yet."</p>
                  <p>"But," said Cecilia, looking quite grave, "I do feel for those who have weak
                     nerves. Do see how poor aunt Edith suffers."</p>
                  <p>"That's different,—aunt Edith's nervousness is entirely different. I was not
                     speaking of that kind, I hardly know how to express it, you have to be with
                     them to understand; but it is altogether different," she repeated thoughtfully,
                     and then followed a long <choice>

                     </choice>. Geoffrey could not but again remark, as he looked at that face cast
                     down so sorrowfully, that those lines of care were too deep for one of her few
                     years. He was still looking with this half-formed melancholy thought, when she
                     raised her head, and seeing his expression, said,</p>
                  <p>"I am not as I used to be, am I? "But come, let us drive away all sadness, let
                     us be happy while we can."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed I think Madeleine," said Cecilia, you might be happy always, you have
                     so much in your power—just this morning I saw your name down on the list of
                     donations to the Dupont Institute for one thousand dollars! Just think! and I
                     heard Mrs. Dupont say to a lady there, that she contemplated retiring from the
                     arduous duties of the institution on account of advancing years, and intended
                     to place her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Ralph Luperthorp, at its head. Now I think I
                     should be<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5590-00000070"/> proud were I in such a
                     position. To think of how much good you can do, Madeleine, how many people you
                     can benefit!" she added, in her sweet, innocent way.</p>
                  <p>"Humph," replied Madeleine, with an ill <choice>

                        <corr>concealed expression</corr>
                     </choice> of scorn on her countenance. Still more haughtily raising her head,
                     she added, "I do not receive any honors till they are righteously earned. It is
                     not as Ralph Luperthorp's lady I shall hold such a position. If I ever do, it
                     will be as a woman whose heart is large enough, tender enough, good enough, to
                     carry all there within its warm bosom. Neither will I hold such a position till
                     I have the knowledge of myself that will serve as the key to unlock the
                     mysterious depositories of other souls, and trace the deep hidden causes that
                     lead to sin and folly, as inevitably as other causes lead to strength and
                     virtue."</p>
                  <p>"Hurrah! Madeleine—splendid! that's the idea!" said Geoffrey, with
                     enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>"Neither," she continued, not heeding the interruption, "will I hold such
                     position till I have a love so universal that in imitation of their infinite
                     author, my bounties may spread in kindness and pity to the erring as well as
                     the good, seeking no reward, but ever grateful for the circumstances that gave
                     me such privilege. So you see," she added, smiling, "my standard of
                     qualifications is so high it is hardly probable your humble servant can ever
                     attain such eminence."</p>
                  <p>"You are right," said Geoffrey. "It is the only true principle, this of an
                     extended love, on which philanthropy should be based. We would not think of
                     leaving an institution of learning under the government of those with but
                     slender intellect, and it seem about as absurd to leave an institution of
                     benevolence to the guidance of those with small capacity of heart, there must
                     be fitness, high merit both of thought and feeling, else we do more harm than
                     good."</p>
                  <p>"I hardly think Miss Arrowfield would agree with you, Mr. Luperthorp," observed
                     Cecilia, "She thinks that one cause of the great success of the Dupont
                     Institute is its remarkably strict code of rules, that reach with powerful
                     check, every tendency in the minds of the young recipients towards that
                     depravity to which by nature we are so prone."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw!" said Madeleine again, with haughty impatience.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine was not wont to be haughty or impatient, thought Geoffrey, this is a
                     new phase of character. Still she seemed to him more loveable, more the true
                     woman than she had ever seemed before, and there was a great pity in his heart
                     for her. But why should he pity that young lady, all a blaze of elegance, with
                     every thing, it might be supposed, to satisfy the most fastidious desires? He
                     could not say why, and yet it seemed to him as though a glittering mantle were
                     thrown round some famished skeleton craving, dying for the sustenance it
                     needed.</p>
                  <p>"And here we are," said Madeleine, with her old, natural laugh, "close by the
                     cottage, as grave as though we had all the cares of the world on us, when our
                     avowed object on starting was to have a fine merry time!"</p>
                  <p>Then they all laughed, and could not understand why they had so cheated
                     themselves; but they were now at the cottage door, and Ilia was there to
                     receive them.</p>
                  <p>"Have you become well acquainted yet with Ilia?" whispered Madeleine. "She is
                     one of the greatest, noblest girls, I ever met. I can tell you she's worth the
                     trouble of finding out." A few minutes with aunt Edith and a pleasant chat with
                     all around, and Madeleine left.</p>

                  <p>THE preparations for Aunt Edith's pleasure trip were completed. She and her
                     husband were to set off without farther delay, for the burning July days, long,
                     dry, and oppressively hot, were beginning to tell upon the invalid.</p>
                  <p>Meantime, while the preparations had been in progress, Mr. Weldon, had with his
                     unhesitating promptness, completed the purchase of a house. It was a new
                     building, in the course of erection, which he had accidentally come upon in a
                     ramble through the city. A large double house, elegant, commodious,
                     comfortable; the very thing he wanted. The size and situation would suit his
                     wife and the young people exactly, and it was to be completed in a few
                     weeks.</p>
                  <p>He announced his purchase the evening before leaving.</p>
                  <p>"And so, when we return," he said, in his peculiarly pleasant voice, "we will
                     put our heads together, and furnish and fit up this house in first rate style.
                     And Geoffrey," he said, addressing the young man, "will remember that with the
                     next month closes our long, idle holiday. I have had letters from the old house
                     in India, hoping we have completed our arrangements for opening our new one
                     here in New York, as they have large consignments they wish to send on
                     immediately. The reason I mention this now, my boy, is to inspire you to finish
                     that job you have had so long on hand, and complete it before we begin
                     business—our great History of India. What do you say?"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was all willingness.</p>
                  <p>"And to you Ilia," Mr. Weldon added, in the same jocose way, "I entrust the
                     supervision of this herculean task. Do not permit this youth to set out for the
                     golden fleece until he has finished the least attractive of the twelve
                     labors."</p>
                  <p>Ilia bowed her head in silence; it was all the assurance needed.</p>
                  <p>"I understand," said Mr. Weldon, that you are engaged during the day, but there
                     are long mornings—and I know your industry my good girl, and that whatever you
                     undertake you will most assuredly perform—and so, as this young gentleman's
                     enthusiasm may fail, and as he is a little, a very little inclined to
                     indolence, I leave him in your hands to push him on."</p>
                  <p>"Hear, aunt Edith, hear!" cried Geoffrey, with tragic vehemence, "Is this so?
                     To you I appeal—is this so?"</p>
                  <p>"No, it is not so," she answered, with a smile. "I will most assuredly
                     vindicate you from this vile charge, even with my latest breath. You are not
                     lazy—you are not procrastinating—not a bit! If you have an object to
                     accomplish, you will certainly go through with it."</p>
                  <p>"That's the idea, aunt Edith," he said with enthusiasm, that's it! When there's
                     occasion I can do my part right well—but when there is not—" he flung himself
                     again into his cushioned chair with great satisfaction, "then—I can enjoy my
                     leisure."</p>
                  <p>"But aunt Edith is a partial judge," said Mr. Weldon. "Her decision in this
                     instance, therefore, is without weight. I will give him up to you, Ilia, and
                     you may use any means you please to keep him up to the mark. And, in truth," he
                     added, "it is more his work than mine, and if any credit comes it is mostly his
                     due."</p>
                  <p>Which insinuation Geoffrey utterly disclaimed, and so the matter was laughingly
                     arranged before they parted that night.</p>
                  <p>Next morning aunt Edith and her husband took their departure.</p>
                  <p>All the household, including old Thomas, his goodwife, Nabbie, and their stout
                     grand-daughter Effie, came to the porch to bid them good bye.</p>
                  <p>"You will have an eye to matters generally," said Mr. Weldon, as he shook hands
                     with Thomas, who received the commission with the utmost gravity.</p>
                  <p>It was a wonderful event, this, to have aunt Edith leave them, even for a
                     day—and kind Mr. Weldon had thoroughly ingratiated himself into their hearts.
                     He was the real gentleman, they said, and they were right; none know better
                     than their class what are the marks of a real gentleman. Urbane and polished,
                     his actions were governed by a sincere deference for all who bore the stamp of
                     a common humanity, without respect to age or station; the little child, the
                     poor, the unfortunate were treated by him with all possible consideration.</p>
                  <p>But all, in truth, felt decidedly uncomfortable at this parting, more so than
                     they would admit. It seemed such a long time to be gone—a whole month! A month
                     to miss those pleasant faces, and that home feeling that centers so lovingly
                     round the old people.</p>
                  <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5590-00000071"/>
                  <p>I am afraid some secret tears were shed, at any rate there were some very sad
                     countenances as they looked after the receding carriage, turning out from the
                     green lane and vanishing from their sight. The house seemed very lonely and
                     silent when they went in again; an oppression was felt in this coming back, as
                     when the dead body of a beloved friend has been removed. All went about their
                     various occupations with a subdued look. Ilia put on her sombre outside
                     garments preparatory to leaving for her daily avocations.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Ilia, do stay home to-day!" exclaimed Cecilia and Geoffrey, with one
                     voice.</p>
                  <p>But Ilia shook her head.</p>
                  <p>"And where does she go?" Geoffrey wonderingly asked when they were alone.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia started, colored, and as usual when the young man ventured upon this
                     subject, did not seem to know exactly what to say.</p>
                  <p>She laughed and told him he was over inquisitive and she was not going to
                     gratify idle curiosity; evidently making an effort to put him off, and turn his
                     attention from the matter altogether.</p>
                  <p>On the next morning when Geoffrey descended to the library, as he thought
                     unusually early, he found Ilia there before him. She appeared to have long been
                     waiting.</p>
                  <p>The little room, so neat, and bountifully adorned with its treasures of books,
                     maps and paintings, looked cool and inviting in these early morning hours, and
                     its atmosphere was filled with the sweet perfume of dewy flowers.</p>
                  <p>The wide glass doors lay open, showing the small plot of ground on this side of
                     the cottage, tastefully laid out in square <choice>

                     </choice> whose centers were filled with sweetest bloom, not the luxuriant
                     growth of the rich tropical clime he had so lately left, but the sweet products
                     of his own native soil; salvias in every variety of brilliant coloring, the
                     pasque flower, heartease, carnation, heliotrope, sweet mignonette, and a host
                     of others, exquisite to the eye and of most delicious fragrance, combined and

                     </choice> tints. This spot was Cecilia's pride, and under the tuition of Thomas
                     she worked most assiduously as assistant gardener. He was very proud of his
                     pupil.</p>
                  <p>Although Geoffrey looked around this little paradise of perfection with great
                     satisfaction, and recognised Ilia with much pleasure, bringing out his books
                     and papers, and sitting down at the other side of the table to go determinedly
                     to work, yet there was something, evidently, he missed.</p>
                  <p>Ilia's quick intuitions told her at once what this was, and her heart sighed
                     deeply as the mortifying conviction was again forced upon her that she, poor
                     soul, was of very little consequence. But she bravely put back all rebellious
                     repinings, and answered his <choice>

                     </choice> looks by quietly saying that Cecilia was in the garden and would be
                     there in a few moments.</p>
                  <p>He was for an instant embarrassed at this prompt answer to his secret thoughts;
                     but the embarrassment was dispelled by the sight of the beautiful girl herself,
                     who came in across the low step, all radiant in blue and white, her hands
                     filled with fresh gathered flowers, and took her seat on the low ottoman to
                     arrange them.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was satisfied; the gleam of light that was wanting now irradiated the
                     apartment; his star had arisen, it lightened the atmosphere around him, and he
                     went to work with right good will.</p>
                  <p>Ilia was a most efficient assistant; she divined at once all he needed, sought
                     out his references, searched dates and authorities and was busy with her pen in
                     copying all he required. They accomplished wonders in the few early hours of
                     that morning. And Ilia even carried the sheets she had finished to the
                     breakfast table, to <choice>

                     </choice> and look them over.</p>
                  <p>"I am becoming so interested in these people," she said—"in tracing their
                     beginnings and endings. This law of cause and effect, how wonderful it is!
                     Wonderful! If we could, side by side with the history of events, give the
                     history of the personal experiences which led to them, then our capacities
                     would be enlightened, and our judgment of people and things broader and more
                     just. We should find, perhaps, that matters we deem beyond our control—these
                     wars—these national ups and downs—prosperity and adversity, moral elevation or
                     physical degradation might be traced to causes within our own
                     jurisdiction."</p>
                  <p>"Now, Ilia," said Cecilia, laughingly, "you are mounting one of your visionary
                     hobbies again! Indeed," she said, turning to Geoffrey, "you have no idea how
                     far she will go. If we were, as she thinks we might be, so wise, and so good
                     and everything that is delightful, then we should be angels—not men and
                     women."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Cecilia! This may do to jest about—but I am not one to think we can be
                     perfect—or like angels—far from it! We have to be rid of a vast amount of
                     matter, even this flesh and blood that is around us, before we can come near
                     that standard. But I have great faith in humanity, and its capacity to raise
                     itself higher than it has ever been yet."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Geoffrey, warming to the subject, I believe there are untold powers
                     yet unlocked in humanity that circumstances are yet to bring forth. I suppose a
                     hundred years since people thought they knew a great deal, and that perfection
                     might possibly be near—but think of the great questions that have been agitated
                     since! Steam, electricity, and other scientific wonders have opened on us, and
                     shown the numerous channels to which they may lead. So when an invention or
                     discovery is made, at once we find our need of it, and still other forces of
                     the human intellect come into play—"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear me!" interrupted Cecilia, with mock alarm, "I always dread to follow
                     Ilia into the clouds, but if you will go there too, what shall I do?"</p>
                  <p>"I will withdraw all I have said," exclaimed Ilia, gaily, "we are not
                     perfect—we cannot be perfect—not by any means! Let us alight upon the solid
                     earth again. I will take some bread if you please!"</p>
                  <p>Thus they breakfasted in real social pleasure. And their evenings and
                     unoccupied hours, which were spent together, became bright and animated by the
                     frequent interchange of thought, and the arguments, discussions, and
                     differences of opinion brought out by their interest in the work in which they
                     were engaged.</p>
                  <p>Ilia was much changed; she had thrown off altogether her former silent reserve,
                     and was communicative and unusually cheerful.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was surprised by the charm of her manner. It grew to be one of his
                     greatest enjoyments to converse with her. There seemed to be a congeniality in
                     their sentiments, and there was earnestness and enthusiasm about her when she
                     was really interested, and such fulness of feeling gathered around every
                     subject she touched that it quite infected him, rousing an energy of thought
                     and feeling he had never been conscious of before.</p>
                  <p>Thus they continued to work with increasing zest, the only drawback being these
                     daily interruptions caused by Ilia's going away.</p>
                  <p>"Why will you go?" Geoffrey would ejaculate impatiently, when the inevitable
                     hour arrived. And through the remaining time allotted to his work he proceeded
                     mechanically and without ambition.</p>
                  <p>Even his horseback rides, and drives with Madeleine and Cecilia lost much of
                     their interest, until Cecilia sometimes remarked in her confidential chats with
                     Ilia, that she wished that horrid writing was over with as Geoffrey was not
                     half so pleasant <choice>
                        <sic>siuce</sic>
                        <corr>since</corr>
                     </choice> he had any thing to do with it.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia could hardly conceive of the bounding delight these thoughtless words
                     caused her companion. Strong and good and noble she knew Ilia to be; but calm
                     and dignified and under such self-control as her own mind was, she had not the
                     faintest conception of that sweeping vortex of force that sometimes surged in
                     the breast of her silent companion. She did not guess the terrible infatuation
                     which swayed her, terrible from the consciousness of its utter
                     hopelessness.</p>
                  <p>Ilia, more keen of comprehension, and quicker of insight, knew that in her
                     innocent heart, all unaware that it was so, Cecilia loved Geoffrey And
                     Geoffrey, she<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5590-00000072"/> thought loved Cecilia.
                     Too noble a nature to cause the slightest misunderstanding between them, Ilia
                     suffered silently; but these little occasional glimpses of light, this seeming
                     appreciation and preference by one who was so much to her—might she not enjoy
                     it alone—place it away among her secret treasures without disloyalty to
                     any?</p>
                  <p>And she worked on most diligently, feeling happier than she had ever been
                     before in her work. So also did Geoffrey, warmed up again with some of the
                     enthusiasm he had felt in its beginning; indeed they were becoming daily more
                     fascinated with their employment.</p>
                  <p>Letters frequently arrived from the travelers, speaking of much enjoyment and
                     renewed health, but also of a desire to get home again. So Geoffrey and his
                     companion began to work in the evenings too, sometimes till late into the
                     night, in order that the task might be completed when their friends
                     returned.</p>
                  <p>How pleasant it was to identify themselves with those whose fortunes they were
                     relating. How proud an author becomes of his real or fancied heroes! They are
                     his children—his brothers and sisters.</p>
                  <p>Ilia felt all this with a peculiar vividness, and she would be pleased and
                     elated, or angry and disappointed as the case might be.</p>
                  <p>"How very aggressive the white race ever is and has been, it seems to me!" said
                     she one evening, raising her flushed face from the books and papers over which
                     she was bending, "how pitiless to the weak! They do so love to dominate, as if
                     they were the judges of all men. Assuming that they are right, they force their
                     habits, opinions and faith on all other men. And not only this, but, forsooth
                     they must receive allegiance for this—everlasting gratitude, and what not.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot," she continued, "Withhold my sympathy with these people—with any
                     people in this crumbling away of their ancient splendor, and I cannot but feel
                     indignant with those who help it along. I think that where such magnificence
                     existed, such architectural elegance prevailed, where learning was so
                     cultivated, where taste and exquisite beauty of workmanship still exist, and
                     all the amenities of life are recognised, it cannot possibly be that they are
                     in such need of our much vaunted civilization. At any rate, it would be
                     reasonable to suppose them in a condition to choose for themselves, whether
                     they would accept or reject."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I do not know," returned her companion, thoughtfully, "When we see a
                     nation or community governed by despotism, human liberty and power is utterly
                     extinguished. Where error prevails, and is forcibly promulgated—where the
                     spread of education, the arts, sciences and literature is crushed and
                     forbidden—where the wealth and energies of the nation are absorbed by a class
                     or clique, while the rest are kept in the lowest ignorance and bond-age, there
                     it would seem as if the interference of those more enlightened was admissible,
                     and its neglect almost a positive wrong. But to do this properly there must be
                     no twofold motive; our own interests must be merged in the stronger desire to
                     benefit the many."</p>
                  <p>"And we ought to be perfectly sure, said Ilia, "that we are giving them any
                     thing better. Our civilization is still very imperfect—there are too many
                     inequalities,"</p>
                  <p>"But its tendencies are to equalise. Our improvements, our inventions are for
                     all"</p>
                  <p>"Well," answered Ilia, her countenance lighting up with the fervor of her
                     emotion, "when I see all raised from debasing want and brutish ignorance to a
                     fair understanding of themselves, with a full sense of the obligations of their
                     being, and the independence that makes men stand individually alone, then I
                     will begin to be proud of our civilization, and surely desire to have it
                     spread; but as it is—" and she shook her head doubtfully, "I fear I could
                     hardly presume to do so."</p>
                  <p>"Then you are not over sanguine of the great good that might be done," answered
                     her companion, feigning disappointment. "Why, I had hoped in time to regenerate
                     the whole world through this great Teutonic ic civilization." But, "he added,
                     drily, I think this propensity for argumentative disquisition which we are just
                     developing will hardly forward the excellence of the work before us,—so perhaps
                     we had better do that well before we expand ourselves farther for the
                     improvement of the world in general."</p>
                  <p>"True," said Ilia, laughing, "but it is all my fault; so now I will try and
                     hold my tongue."</p>
                  <p>They were indeed full of conscious enjoyment, this couple; Geoffrey
                     particularly so. He had found the key to unlock the energies and powers of a
                     really superior mind. How many pass through life with a pressure on their
                     faculties never removed until death takes off the seal. The atmosphere of some
                     casts a depression upon the soul—we cannot speak, we cannot show ourselves in
                     their presence; while others lift off with their magnetic fingers every weight
                     that presses upon us, and associated with them we are exalted beyond ourselves.
                     Thus Geoffrey lived, as in a new existence; ideas, thoughts, bright imaginings
                     flowed through his consciousness with a living power; he acknowledged, but
                     could not explain the influence. Perhaps it was that for the first time in all
                     his life he was fully appreciated. He looked into that pale face for the
                     solution of the mystery; the eyes were downcast—scarcely downcast, either—but
                     as if turned inward, as it taking cognizance of some brilliant yet unspoken
                     thought. The face was plain, very plain, and yet when those eyes were lifted to
                     his some subtile charm seemed to glance from them, assimilating to his soul,
                     filling it with a delight unknown before.</p>
                  <p>He was as though possessed of two existences, as I have said,—one dwelling in
                     the atmosphere of a revealed loveliness, the other subtile, impalpable,
                     unconscious, yet full of strength; finding its joy in the inner comprehension
                     of a sublimer loveliness, known and felt by the soul, but unrevealed to the
                     outer senses.</p>
                  <p>But there was another watching with curious eyes the developments taking place.
                     Not Madeleine—for although almost daily a visiter at the cottage, she staid but
                     a few moments at any time. It was generally when taking the little Madeleine
                     and her governess out for a drive, that her call was made, or occasionally of a
                     late afternoon to give Cecilia and Geoffrey a short airing in the carriage just
                     before dusk. Neither was it the fair Cecilia. She was satisfied, and only too
                     happy in the kind attentions paid to Ilia. Why should a lovely girl, conscious
                     of her power, the object of an unfeigned admiration wherever she went, trouble
                     herself about the queer crotchets of a pair of silent enthusiasts, who seemed
                     to be possessed for the time with a sort of infatuation for the work they were
                     about; No: she did not trouble herself concerning their visionary thoughts and
                     imaginings, she had her own sources of enjoyment, and in the quiet grace of a
                     delicate and cultivated mind, she fully enjoyed them.</p>
                  <p>But old Thomas was in his element; he had something to find out; his keen
                     vision had lighted upon something not less interesting, apparently, to the
                     lowest than to the highest mind. Every avenue of sharp watchfulness was on the
                     look out. In answer to the sage advice of his old wife, Nabbie, "just to let
                     the young folks alone, and not trouble his head about them," he answered
                     promptly,</p>
                  <p>"Didn't the new master, that has been so kind to me, didn't he bid me to have
                     an eye everywhere? And musn't I do it? You know Nabbie, you were always a poor,
                     simple body, that never could see anything but was just before your eyes! I can
                     see deeper, and I do not like all that's going on, indeed I don't. What's all
                     this writing that's scratching away from early in the morning till late at
                     night? No good can come of it Nabbie! Young master Geoffrey grows pale and that
                     dark girl more silent and dark, while my sweet young lady mopes alone. We have
                     no music, no laughing,—even the flowers she doesn't seem to like so well. I
                     have heard of the devil casting his spell upon poor, bewildered creatures. I
                     misdoubt he's a hand on that horrid <unclear>pen.</unclear> Scratch, scratch,
                     it would<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5590-00000073"/> make your very blood tingle
                     in your veins to hear!"</p>
                  <p>"Lord help us!" ejaculated Nabbie.</p>
                  <p>The kitchen looked dark, and the few living coals on the hearth reflected in
                     the polished tins hanging on the wall, glowed out like so many unearthly eyes,
                     staring down upon her. "Lord help us!" she repeated fervently, "But, Thomas,
                     the devil could not come near our good young people. He is only permitted to
                     perplex the bad."</p>
                  <p>"Now, Nabbie, as I have said, you are a simple body—"</p>
                  <p>"To be sure, Thomas, I ought to know it, you've told me so often enough,"
                     interrupted the old woman, quietly.</p>
                  <p>"Woman, listen to me;" and Thomas assumed a tone and manner of severe dignity,
                     "are there not tempters—do we not read of them?"</p>
                  <p>"Amen!" said Nabbie, and she hung her head rebuked.</p>
                  <p>"I do not," he continued, like that dark girl. There's mischief brewing. I have
                     tried every way to get at those papers to see what they were about. You know I
                     am smart at my pen, and my sight is keen as a razor, but somehow that girl
                     always manages to keep them out of my way. I have brought in a bunch of flowers
                     of a morning to put on the table beside them—some of my finest carnations and
                     rosebuds that you would think might make her forget what she was about for a
                     minute or two, and ask a few questions, so that a body could feel they might
                     stay a bit,—but no; it would only be 'thank you,' an' that's all! Sometimes a
                     sudden notion would take them, and every thing was whisked off to the
                     summerhouse in a flurry—an' I'd be outside puttering about, tying up the vines
                     or anything else, an' I'd listen—and there'd only be scratch, scratch, an' the
                     dripping of the water over the stones. I might as well been a mile away for all
                     I could hear. It's mighty strange."</p>
                  <p>"But, maybe, after all" said Nabbie, whose curiosity was very difficult to
                     rouse, "maybe, after all, there's nothing in it!"</p>
                  <p>Thomas was so much disgusted at her stubborn imbecility that he did not attempt
                     to answer.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, at this moment, a knock announced a visiter, and Humphrey from the
                     "big house," as Ralph's was called, came in. So Thomas was charmed into good
                     humor again by finding a ready listener in his friend.</p>
                  <p>In Nabbie and her old husband the rule of that fallacy that to woman belongs
                     that officious curiosity that is so weak and offensive, was reversed.</p>
                  <p>And the grave and aged Humphrey was not without a considerable share of it in
                     his composition. But Humphrey to-day felt himself deeply aggrieved; he was
                     inclined to be severe on all young people, for it was the young who had deposed
                     him. He was now merely retained as a stable-keeper, a comfortable sinecure,
                     well-paid and easy to be sure: but in the old master's time, in his fine
                     broadcloth bottle-green coat, with a broad black band on his shining beaver, he
                     was thought to look well enough to drive the family anywhere.</p>
                  <p>"But times are changing, Thomas," he would say, with bitter significance. "It
                     is not as it used to be; the young folks must have their fine gallants to drive
                     them round with all the airs of a dancing master."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" they would all sigh in chorus, "if the old master could only come
                     back!"</p>
                  <p>"Lord preserve us!" echoed Thomas, "How amazed he'd be to see our master
                     Geoffrey so taken up and bewitched by that dark girl," and, with a great
                     stretch of his vivid imagination—"in the very face of that wonderful beauty
                     dissolving away in sighs and tears! Yes, we may well say that only the power of
                     the evil one could do it. Sometimes I would think I will tell young master
                     Geoffrey all that I know. They tried to keep it from me, but old Thomas is no
                     fool, I found out enough. And I think may be its my duty to tell him."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Thomas," said Nabbie, "you'll never do that! She's a good girl, with
                     all you may say. Do you remember how she nursed me through all that long fit of
                     the rheumatism, and how she has made warm flannels for me all these winters,
                     and how much else of kindness she has done us. No, no! And remember your
                     promise to our good mistress, that you would never speak of it. No, no, Thomas,
                     you couldn't do such wicked thing?"</p>
                  <p>Thomas, with all his assumption of superiority, was a little afraid of <choice>

                        <corr>his</corr>
                     </choice> old wife, Nabbie, he would not dare to do any thing in direct
                     opposition to her will. And he was much mollified by the course events were
                     taking. Geoffrey desired him next morning to have the horses at the gate early
                     in the afternoon, as he and Miss Cecilia were going to take a long ride, and he
                     had also heard young Mrs. Ralph Luperthorp making an appointment with them to
                     go to church on the following Sunday—she would call for them—to hear some
                     famous preacher that all the world was talking about. This was all as it should
                     be: he was relieved for the present from committing himself by any overt act.
                     But he would keep his eyes about him, that he would—have a clear look out "for
                     things in general," as the master had bidden him—yes that he would!</p>

                  <head type="sub">A REVELATION.</head>
                  <p>THE following morning opened one of those lovely Sabbaths when all nature seems
                     peculiarly hushed for a sacred rest.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine called early; it was expected the building would be crowded, and they
                     must take their seats before the great rush began.</p>
                  <p>Ilia watched her friends as they departed, and almost rejoiced that she was
                     left alone. She retired to her own room with such a volume of unwrought
                     happiness in her being, such a sense of deepest gratitude for all around and
                     within her, that it seemed truly the intuitional worship of the soul. These
                     moods come unbidden to all true hearts, that have not through contact with the
                     outer world lost their inner harmony with nature; unsought, unaware they come,
                     like angel visits, "few and far between," as though to remind the soul of its
                     kinship with heaven. The young girl looked from her little turret window out
                     upon the clear waters of the shining river, and up into the blue ether above,
                     that seemed as a vail between her and the Infinite beyond, and the spirit of
                     devotion held her. Yes, she must worship. While there is the capacity to
                     desire, and the power to appreciate, we must worship; while there is light and
                     love, and the great mystery of being, we must worship; while there is grandeur,
                     and sublimity, and while there is beauty and power, we must worship; in the
                     sunshine and in the shadow, when nature puts forth her charms, or when she
                     frowns, and trembling earth and lowering sky speak terror to the soul, we
                     worship still. It is the grand conception of a power behind the outward power,
                     which fills our spirits with awe, and feeling our own impotence, we bend the
                     knee in supplication to that which seems so much mightier than we. So, in the
                     wild shout of joy, as in the last wail of despair we speak the same language of
                     dependence. When thought strives for utterance, and finds no sounds fitted to
                     give forth its deep intuitions, we humble ourselves instinctively before that
                     mystery beyond us, the comprehension of which eludes our most searching
                     intellect.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," murmured Ilia, "we must worship, on this day of grateful rest—on every
                     day. Wherever there is light, and beauty, and life, we must praise the
                     Benificence that has given us these glimmering conceptions, these strange
                     responses within our <choice>

                        <corr>own</corr>
                     </choice> souls, this sympathy, dim and unutterable, with the Infinite."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that I could speak all this," she cried, "and could rise to thee, thou God
                     of all, in adoration of profoundest gratitude. But words are as naught to
                     express the hights and depths of these emotions. In silence, then I must
                     worship; in the into-nations, and murmuring echoes of my own being I will raise
                     my altar of praise and wait expression—till when—Oh, God! and where?"</p>
                  <p>Silent she sat, unconscious of the time until roused by the returning
                        carriage<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5590-00000074"/> wheels. Then starting up
                     and throwing off the deep reverie that held her, she hastened down to meet them
                     as they came in.</p>
                  <p>Madeleine drove immediately home, but Geoffrey and Cecilia, in high spirits,
                     and full of enthusiasm, lingered in the parlor without stopping to lay aside
                     gloves or bonnet, dilating to the listening Ilia upon the fine sermon they had
                     heard, and the great power of the orator, and how he had held the immense
                     audience completely enthralled for such a length of time. It was wonderful! and
                     the wonder afforded them conversation for the remainder of the day.</p>
                  <p>"Why is it," said Ilia, after an animated discussion upon the merits and
                     demerits of prominent persons, "Why is it that the genius of some is so
                     speedily recognised? They become the leaders and idols of the many, while
                     others of equal power—perhaps even far in advance—are crushed by neglect, and
                     they and their generation pass away before they come to be appreciated?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, that is it" said Geoffrey, "It is because they are so much in advance—that
                     is the cause of their failure. The popular leader, in his full zenith, requires
                     a combination of qualities, not all of them of the most exalted kind. He must
                     be strong in sentiment, but not universal in application. He must be enough in
                     advance of followers to excite their admiration, but not enough to take them
                     out of the limit of their thought. He must have their <choice>

                        <corr>prejudices</corr>
                     </choice>, and party biases, but he must be able to say all that they would
                     express in a much more telling manner. In fact he must be the representative
                     man of <emph>his</emph> age—not the genius that would lead to the wants and
                     capacities of a coming one. He must be bold, daring, but not fearless. His
                     emotional nature must be powerful; he must be able to electrify by the
                     enthusiasm of his love, and chill by the withering sarcasm of his hate, must
                     expatiate on liberty of thought and action, and even rouse his listeners to its
                     meaning, in a wide and comprehensive sense, astonishing them by the wild
                     waywardness of his own independent flight; but he must possess the cautious
                     judgment to check his scaring at the right point—a little farther and he must
                     most inevitably fall. Indeed, I know of no greater slave, in religion and
                     polities, or what else, than the successful partizan leader. He may be lauded
                     to the skies by his own party, and yet he may utterly despise himself; a mind
                     in full power, grasping after truth, must chafe in the fetters that bind it to
                     reject or receive only so far as blends with the views of others; yet he is

                     </choice> as those whom he leads will permit."</p>
                  <p>The day following this splendid Sabbath morning, was cloudy, close, hot, and
                     oppressive. Still, Ilia in the early morning came down all dressed for a
                     journey.</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be possible, Ilia, that you are going away. Where to?" said
                     Geoffrey, incautiously. But when he saw the painful expression of countenance
                     that could not be concealed, he checked himself at once, and begged to be
                     excused.</p>
                  <p>"But we will be so lonely, cousin Cecilia, and I; could we not persuade you to
                     stay with us? I am so sorry you must go?"</p>
                  <p>How the heart of the girl bounded at these earnest words! She knew that he
                     meant all that he said. "And he does care for my society," she said to herself.
                     Poor girl—she was truly lonely and isolated, with all the warmth and the
                     friendship surrounding her. And to such natures kindness and appreciation
                     though doled out in minutest quantities, are hugged and fondled and dwelt upon
                     with a delight unknown to those who have troops of friends.</p>
                  <p>"When, then, would she be back?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Not till late in the evening."</p>
                  <p>"That is too bad—indeed it is." he reiterated, as he followed her to the door
                     on her way out.</p>
                  <p>As he stood there, looking after her, and still stood, even though she was long
                     out of sight, there was a strange mixture of pity and interest working in his
                     breast.</p>
                  <p>She had indeed become almost a necessity to his enjoyment, and yet it seemed
                     strange to him it should be so. There was some unaccountable mystery about her
                     that kept her apart from the general world, and covered all her movements with
                     a questionable hue. Still she seemed to him the very soul of truthfulness and
                     honor. He was sorely perplexed when he sat down to his work in that same
                     attractive little room; the life of what he was about was taken out of his
                     employment; he was nerveless and listless; even when the beautiful Cecilia came
                     in with her offering of flowers, it failed to arouse him to energy.</p>
                  <p>It was truly a wearisome day—so oppressive that one could scarcely draw a long
                     breath. A slight shower, with thunder and lightning passed over before noon,
                     but it failed to clear the atmosphere of its stifling heat. Clouds still
                     lingered during the afternoon, and as they drew the little tea-table in front
                     of the garden door, and sipped and chatted the hour away, the bright flashes of
                     lightning would dance athwart their cups and plates with a glittering intensity
                     that made them start.</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid," said Geoffrey, "we will have a fearful storm before the evening
                     is over."</p>
                  <p>"And poor Ilia out in it."</p>
                  <p>"Surely," said Geoffrey, alarmed, "she will not leave where she is, to brave
                     such a night as this is likely to be."</p>
                  <p>"To be sure she will," answered Cecilia, "you do not know her as I do, or you
                     would not have any doubt. She will certainly be home, because she said she
                     would."</p>
                  <p>As the evening advanced a thick darkness overspread everything, and the
                     lightning came in with fearful intensity, while the thunder rolled and the wind
                     blew, shaking the cottage to its very foundation. The rain too was pouring in
                     torrents, and the hail rattled on the windows as it would break them
                     through.</p>
                  <p>"My God! what a night for any one to be exposed to!" exclaimed Geoffrey, as he
                     walked rapidly up and down the room, "what a fearful night!"</p>
                  <p>He put his face close to the window pane, vainly striving to penetrate the
                     thick mist, but the vivid flashes momentarily lighting up the gloom, made the
                     darkness more impenetrable, "I must go and seek her—she will certainly be
                     lost!" he said.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, no! cousin Geoffrey,—you must not. You could not find her—you could
                     not help her! Oh, do not go—I pray you will not go!" said Cecilia, almost
                     distractedly.</p>
                  <p>"But I must, Cecilia. It is only common humanity to do so."</p>
                  <p>The frightened girl, trembling with unwonted alarm, dropped down upon the sofa,
                     as still another blinding flash came followed by a rattling peal of thunder, as
                     though the very framework of the heavens was crashing above them. Geoffrey
                     hastily called Thomas and Nabbie from the kitchen, to remain with their young
                     mistress during his absence, and rushed out into the storm.</p>
                  <p>The darkness was so complete that he could scarcely tell whither he was going.
                     Endeavoring to take the direction in which he had seen Ilia walk in the
                     morning, he followed the winding lane, bracing himself against the stormy wind
                     as best he could. The wind still kept increasing, twisting and cracking in its
                     fury the branches of the trees above his head. An occasional gleam revealed the
                     deep embankments in the distance, surrounding vacant lots that flooded with
                     torrents of rain presented the appearance of a lake or river. Then a great fear
                     fell upon him that in the darkness Ilia might have missed her footing and
                     fallen in. He stood still and called aloud with frantic eagerness,</p>
                  <p>"Oh Ilia, Ilia! won't you answer?" But no sound came to his ears save the
                     moaning of the wind, and the rending of the shaggy trees on either side the
                     road.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he fancied that he heard the wail of a human voice, and again he
                     shouted with all his strength, but to no avail. He groaned in real distress,
                     "Oh, she is lost, my poor Ilia, she is surely lost!"</p>
                  <p>What was that he saw moving—surely that flash of lightning just dying away,
                     revealed some object in motion, and not afar off.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey hastened to the spot, trembling with excitement; but only a clump of
                        trees<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5590-00000075"/> met his grasp. Certainly
                     now he heard some breathing sound;</p>
                  <p>"Oh Ilia," he cried, "will you speak?" "Geoffrey! Geoffrey!" answered a faint
                     glad voice, and the girl rushed to him throwing her arms around him, and
                     calling him the most endearing epithets.</p>
                  <p>"Oh Geoffrey, dear Geoffrey," she sobbed, "I thought I should never, never see
                     you again!"</p>
                  <p>But after this burst of feeling, which completely overwhelmed him, it seemed as
                     if her lips were sealed; she shrank from him, and hurried on, as if not caring
                     whither she went.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was silent also. He had been so much excited, so completely overcome
                     with terror that the reaction soothed him into a pleasant sense of quiet and
                     peace. A feeling of strange happiness thrilled him at that almost confession. A
                     sensation new and intense, such as he had never before imagined. These
                     contending emotions kept him speechless. All he could say was, "Ilia, take my
                     arm; the ground is uneven, you will fall." He felt her tremble as she did so,
                     and a great pity swelled in his breast; he could have put his arm round her,
                     and held her up with loving care. But they walked on silently arm in arm, their
                     hearts full, yet neither having a word to say.</p>
                  <p>Such a storm was raging in Ilia's breast that the beating of the storm without
                     she did not heed. A sense of shame and deep mortification was working within
                     her.—What had she done? She had revealed the secret of her soul. She had
                     lowered herself in the estimation of one whose good opinion was more to her
                     than all in life beside. What would he think of her? How he must despise
                     her—would that she could die!</p>
                  <p>But she need not have been so distressed. Geoffrey had little vanity about him;
                     it would be much harder to make him understand how anybody could love him, than
                     how they could not.</p>
                  <p>He was indeed startled, and a thought, a sweet, delightful thought came across
                     his mind, "Does she, indeed think so much of me!" It was but for a moment,
                     however,—that momentary pleasurable feeling was speedily dispelled.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, she was so frightened," he thought, "Whoever she might have met she would
                     have been just as much delighted. Even if old Thomas had come along, looking
                     for her, she would have caressed him with just as much extasy.</p>
                  <p>The storm was now abating. When they reached the cottage all was silent and
                     dark.</p>
                  <p>Miss Cecilia had gone to her room, the girl, Effie, said. She had been very
                     much frightened and was very sick—almost like to die.</p>
                  <p>Ilia hastened up at once. Cecilia was lying upon the bed, while old Nabbie, in
                     great alarm was chafing her hands and face. When she saw Ilia the young girl
                     started from her recumbent posture, and threw her arms about her friend,
                     weeping like a child,</p>
                  <p>"And where's Geoffrey,—is he safe—is he unhurt?" she cried.</p>
                  <p>Through that long night there was no sleep in their peaceful little room.
                     Cecilia, the sweet, the gifted girl, warmed by the excitements of the evening,
                     and by the reaction of her recent anxiety, poured out every thought on the
                     breast of her tried friend and companion; little did she dream that every word
                     she uttered struck a pang of agony into the listener's heart.</p>
                  <p>"I so love him, Ilia! I did not know till to-night how much. I felt as though I
                     should die when I thought he was in danger. But Ilia, dearest, you will never
                     breathe this? I must tell you—I could not live if I did not, my more than
                     sister, my best and dearest friend! But Geoffrey does not love me—my heart will
                     break! I used to think he did, but now, I do not know why, I fear he does
                     not."</p>
                  <p>"But he must—he shall love you," said Ilia, impetuously, and seeing her
                     companion's astonishment, she added less vehemently.</p>
                  <p>"Because he cannot help it. He cannot be with you my beautiful Cecilia, and
                     know of all your worth and goodness, and not love you."</p>
                  <p>All were under considerable restraint the next time they met. Geoffrey was much
                     concerned at the appearance of suffering in the countenance of Cecilia. He
                     blamed himself for leaving her under so much alarm. He had not supposed it
                     anything more than the fear which every one experiences in so violent a storm.
                     The young man spoke so tenderly, and seemed so assiduous in his attentions,
                     that Cecilia was all confusion and alarm. Perhaps he had overheard her
                     confession, or had suspected from an inadvertent speech the real cause of her
                     excitement last evening; or perhaps old Nabbie, who had witnessed her despair
                     when he left, and heard her lamentations, might have told him something.
                     Cecilia was ready to sink with mortification.</p>
                  <p>To Ilia Geoffrey dared not speak, though he would have given worlds to do so.
                     He could not altogether forget the last evening's encounter, and the
                     remembrance made him feel a delicacy in addressing her. Indeed they were all
                     most painfully embarrassed, and it was quite a relief when after breakfast
                     letters were brought in from aunt Edith and her husband, announcing that they
                     expected to arrive at home that very night.</p>
                  <p>When the two travelers, so anxiously expected and so eagerly waited for, at
                     length were settled in the little cottage once more, their quick and loving
                     eyes soon noted a change in the young people. They found them pale, anxious,
                     and quite unlike the bright, happy beings they had left.</p>
                  <p>"You have been working too hard, Geoffrey, and Cecilia and Ilia have been too
                     much confined. You must start off at once, all of you, and take a trip to the
                     mountains," said Mr. Weldon resolutely, anticipating a demur to his wishes.</p>
                  <p>It was as he decreed. Before the end of another week the three were scaling the
                     cloud-capped peaks, breathing the inspiration of the mountain air, and feeling
                     the littleness of their atom selves in the midst of the sublime immensity
                     around them.</p>
                  <p>Ilia threw off all her former cold restraint and gave herself up to the full
                     enthusiasm of enjoyment. She was the life and leader of the party. They all
                     seemed for the time to forget former thoughts and misgivings, and live but in
                     the exultation of the present. When, after a week's absence, they returned to
                     their friends and the sweet influences of their cottage home, they appeared to
                     have renewed their lives, and to be now ready to start on a fresh race,
                     spirited and blooming as ever.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">LOVE.</head>
                  <p>THE matter that now occupied the general attention of the family was the
                     preparation for their new residence. Ilia was not included in the committee of
                     arrangements; she attended to her daily duties as usual; but Cecilia and aunt
                     Edith, accompanied by the gentlemen, were out in the carriage part of each day,
                     making selections of furniture, and all the different matters connected with
                     the complete arrangement of a first class establishment.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey and Mr. Weldon were now also quite occupied with their business
                     arrangements; the young man had not much time therefore to brood over his own
                     particular feelings. He enjoyed these excursions with his aunt Edith and
                     Cecilia during the day, and even felt a pride in the admiration which the
                     beautiful girl elicited wherever she went, yet he longed for the evening to
                     come that he might enjoy that calm, that soul-contentment which he ever
                     experienced when near Ilia.</p>
                  <p>He loved to listen to her low, musical voice as she read aloud to Mr. Weldon,
                     or talked with him about the countries he had visited, and the many objects of
                     interest which he had met. In her observations, clear and intelligent, her keen
                     appreciation of all she heard, and her own occasional touches of embellishment,
                     there was to the young man a charm that held him in rapt enjoyment. And then
                     again there was a sadness in her voice at times that touched his inmost
                     feelings, and a tenderness and<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5590-00000076"/> pity
                     would steal over him, and his heart would yearn with a craving desire to sit
                     beside her and soothe and comfort her, pouring out his every emotion of
                     sympathy and love. Thus the evening hours passed in a dreamy change from one
                     extreme of feeling to another.</p>
                  <p>In a few weeks all the arrangements were completed—only the paintings remained
                     to be selected. The time of their stay in the little cottage was now very
                     short. Mr. Weldon was determined to have some fine pictures, and desired that
                     their selection should be made with great care.</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, then, must go with us," said aunt Edith.</p>
                  <p>"Are you a judge of the art, Miss Ilia?" said Geoffrey, turning to her.
                     Cecilia, always eager to prove her friend's superiority, answered hastily and
                     without thought,</p>
                  <p>"Oh, dear me! why, don't you know she is a most exquisite artist? Have you not
                     noticed those paintings in your—"she stopped short, remembering her promise,
                     and only making matters worse by exclaiming,</p>
                  <p>"How thoughtless I am! Do excuse me, Ilia!"</p>
                  <p>It was really distressing to see poor Ilia's utter confusion.</p>
                  <p>"But why make a secret of it?" said Geoffrey, "Any one might be proud of such
                     works. I have often admired their perfect finish and beauty, and wondered who
                     the artist could have been, feeling as though I could bow in honor to such
                     talent—and now allow me—"he said, making a deep reverence to the agitated
                     girl.</p>
                  <p>She accompanied them to the gallery of paintings from which they intended to
                     select. Attended through this splendid array of art and wealth with such kind
                     assiduity Ilia for once felt proud and happy. Geoffrey was at her side; they
                     enjoyed together the rare gems so profusely displayed.</p>
                  <p>The rooms were filled with visiters—gay and fashionable young men, elegant and
                     haughty women—but he had no eyes for any but the plain girl beside him. What a
                     beating tumult of joy now filled her heart! There seemed to be but one distinct
                     consciousness, and that was happiness, entire and complete.</p>
                  <p>Cecilia had met many young friends, and was interrupted in her passage through
                     the rooms by their enthusiastic gatherings around her. Mr. Weldon and aunt
                     Edith also met those they knew, so Geoffrey and Ilia were left to themselves
                     for a time. These few hours, so rich in their meaning, seemed to Ilia in
                     looking back to them in after times, as though they stretched out to days and
                     months of sweetest bliss.</p>
                  <p>In their wanderings they came upon a group of young people, all life and
                     gayety, and overflowing with present enjoyment. Cecilia was in their midst, the
                     fairest and most attractive of them all. She was quite animated, and had never
                     looked lovelier. Geoffrey stood still for a moment gazing at her, as he
                     said,</p>
                  <p>"Ah, no art can come up to the perfection of nature! Did you ever see a more
                     perfect form and face?" and as if she heard him, the object of his admiration
                     came smiling to his side, and putting her arm within his said,</p>
                  <p>"Come with me, cousin Geoffrey, I have something the most beautiful you ever
                     saw to show you."</p>
                  <p>Ilia was left alone: the black cloud of reality closed about her. Her ideal
                     world was gone, and reeling, staggering in that faint sickness of sharp sudden,
                     deadly pain, she made her way from the now hateful rooms.</p>
                  <p>In a few minutes all were ready to leave, but Ilia was not to be found.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey made a circuit of the gallery, supposing she might have been tempted
                     to linger in some distant corner by unexpected discoveries in art. But the
                     search was vain. It was strange. Aunt Edith, however, suggested that she might
                     have become faint from the heat of the rooms, and gone home.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was a good deal agitated, but endeavored to conceal it, Ilia was
                     certainly well when he left her, and he was away but a short time—it could not
                     be that anything had happened.</p>
                  <p>On reaching the cottage they found the servants in utter consternation. Miss
                     Ilia had fallen down in a fit on the floor of the hall, and had been carried
                     senseless into the parlor.</p>
                  <p>All were hastily rushing thither, but aunt Edith kept them back. She would go
                     in alone. She found Ilia lying upon the sofa, weak and sick, but a flood of
                     tears brought <choice>
                        <sic>relieif</sic>
                        <corr>relief</corr>
                     </choice>, and the anxiety in regard to her was soon dispelled by aunt Edith's
                     reappearance. It was, she said, as she had supposed. Ilia had felt somewhat
                     faint, and immediately left the gallery. The hurried walk home had exhausted
                     her and she had really fainted as she entered the house. It was not a fit, as
                     the fears of Effie had made her suppose. "She will be quite well, I think in
                     the morning," said her tender nurse, "but I have prescribed quiet for her
                     to-night; she must keep her room."</p>
                  <p>Early the next morning—very early, before the family thought of rising.
                     Geoffrey was up and wandering in the little garden, now sitting under the vines
                     by the running spring, and then up again to some other point of rest. He had
                     spent a most uncomfortable night, and restless and wakeful had risen to go out
                     in the fresh air. But he was still as uncomfortable as ever, and turning
                     impatiently, retraced his steps to the house. Opening the library door, which
                     he had left unfastened, he started to find another person in the room. It was
                     Ilia, sitting solitary, completely absorbed, apparently, in gazing at his
                     portrait, hanging in the niche before her. It might be an artist's reverie; a
                     study of the effect of peculiar colors in the early morning light. Geoffrey did
                     not wish to disturb the student, but the slight sound he made in coming in
                     roused her, and looking round at the intruder, her first impulse was to rush
                     from the room. But the illness of last night was still, evidently, hanging
                     about her, she had gone but a few steps when she staggered, and Geoffrey
                     catching her in his arms led her to the sofa, and sat down beside her.</p>
                  <p>Ilia attempted to make some apology for being there; aunt Edith had obliged her
                     to remain during the night on the couch in the parlor,—she could not
                     sleep—and—but here she broke down, and fell into such a passion of weeping that
                     Geoffrey was in perfect dismay. He used every persuasive word to comfort, but
                     what could he do? Would she not tell him the cause of her trouble? Would she
                     not speak to him as a brother? As she became more calm, and with strong effort
                     endeavored to master her feelings, he continued.</p>
                  <p>"I have always felt a great interest in you, Ilia, and would much desire that
                     we should be closer friends; but you seem disposed to shun me,—I have sometimes
                     fancied that you actually disliked me."</p>
                  <p>"Oh!" cried Ilia, starting, and raising her eyes to his with a look of appeal;
                     but in an instant they dropped again, and the old impassive look came over her
                     face.</p>
                  <p>"And I fear you are not well, Ilia" added Geoffrey. "or that there is some
                     secret grief on your mind. Speak to me—let me be as a brother to you. I can
                     sympathise with you. It would be such a happiness to me," he said, tenderly,
                     "to be of any service to you and Cecilia."</p>
                  <p>At that name Ilia started again: "Oh, I must go! Let me go!" she cried.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was a little offended at her abrupt manner, and as he also arose, said
                     haughtily,</p>
                  <p>"Certainly; I have no right to detain—I have no right to press my wishes upon
                     you, or to ask your confidence in any thing."</p>
                  <p>"But you have," she said, with strong emotion. "No one on this earth has so
                     much right. Will you forgive me? I have hurt your feelings—oh, in pity forgive
                     me! She lingered an instant with her hand upon the door, turned her pleading
                     eyes upon him, and was gone.</p>
                  <p>The young man sat down more bewildered than ever. "I must tear this strange
                     girl from my thoughts," he muttered, "She is taking possession of my very
                     soul."</p>
                  <p>Ilia was at the breakfast table next morning, only bearing traces of her
                     illness in increased pallor of countenance. Even against aunt Edith's
                     solicitation, she insisted upon going out. Geoffrey, true to his determination,
                     manifested no interest.<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5590-00000077"/> He and
                     Cecilia passed out from the breakfast-room into the garden. Cecilia had a new
                     flower to show him. She was full of sweetness as a new-blown rose, herself,
                     sweet, graceful and gracious,—yet through all that day the image of the plain,
                     dark eyed Ilia haunted Geoffrey, and his heart ached in sympathy with the
                     pained, sad glance with which those eyes had unconsciously followed them, as
                     laughing and chatting gaily together, he and Cecilia left the room.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE NEW HOUSE AND THE OLD TROUBLE.</head>
                  <p>THE cottage with its home-like comfort and its pleasant reminiscences was at
                     last given up, and the family took possession of their splendid and spacious
                     mansion. Much gossip went about concerning the magnificence of the new house,
                     the gentlemanly bearing, culture and refinement of its owner the great East
                     India nabob.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith's life seemed renewed again. Her sweet countenance still retained
                     its thoughtful expression, but something of her old gayety had returned. The
                     strange events of life had brought her in the end an abundant share of
                     blessings: quietly and thoughtfully she and her husband traced their past
                     experience, seeking from all the disappointment and bitterness of former years,
                     to gather sweetness for the years that remained.</p>
                  <p>How happy they were! How constantly, side by side, they dispensed the happiness
                     they enjoyed! Surely, as the good Madame Duleep had prayed, the last days of
                     her old friend were to be his best.</p>
                  <p>They were thronged with visiters. Old acquaintances renewed their visits. Aunt
                     Edith was again recognised as "in the world." Mrs. Dupont was among the first
                     to call and welcome them to their new home, congratulating them on their
                     disentombment, as she said. The good lady was much pleased with Mr. Weldon, and
                     she roused the lion in Geoffrey again, by saying that she was most happy to
                     have her brother's son take his proper position in society once more.</p>
                  <p>Ralph also made his visit of form. The day was chilly; summer was past, and the
                     fall months were commencing. Accordingly Ralph was wrapped up close to the
                     chin, and came in a close carriage. All felt the frost of his atmosphere during
                     his brief stay. "I was not aware that our fires were low," said Mr. Weldon,
                     drily, "until your friend came in."</p>
                  <p>Madeleine, of course, was delighted to have the family so much nearer her.
                     Geoffrey and Cecilia were her happiness: "I could not live without you!" she
                     would say, emphatically, "My life would be a desert."</p>
                  <p>"Why Madeleine," Geoffrey would reply in mock reproof, "with all you possess
                     beside—how covetous?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, of course! of course! I ought to be ashamed to say this. There is dear
                     Ralph, and my sweet little girl, and mother Dupont, who has through all my life
                     done so much for me. Oh, certainly, I ought to remember all this!" and the
                     young wife relapsed into quiet thoughtfulness.</p>
                  <p>The gayeties of the season had commenced: the winter was fairly set in. Among
                     the denizens of the fashionable world the elegance and beauty of Cecilia
                     attracted universal attention, and she and Geoffrey were constantly engaged,
                     either at parties or places of amusement, or with evening visiters.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith did not object to this; she was anxious that they should take their
                     place in society, and enjoy themselves. Geoffrey now seldom saw Ilia; he was
                     occupied during the day with his business, and she had lately withdrawn herself
                     from the family meals. The young man often watched for her, and sometimes made
                     inquiries, but there was always some excuse—she had gone out, or was engaged,
                     or something of the kind—that was all he could learn without appearing too
                     particular in his questions. Once he met her in the library, aunt Edith's own
                     favorite room, where she and her husband generally spent their evenings.
                     Leaving for a moment the gay young visiters in the drawing-room, Geoffrey
                     entered this apartment. Ilia was there; she sat at the round table, looking
                     ever some maps with Mr. Weldon.</p>
                  <p>How comfortable and cosy it looked! The bright fire in the grate, the rich
                     furniture, the walls covered with books, and the smiling, contemplative faces
                     which looked up to him with a welcome, made a beautiful picture, which he
                     paused an instant at the door to contemplate.</p>
                  <p>"Come here, Geoffrey, and tell us all about this," said Mr. Weldon, pointing
                     him to a seat beside Ilia. They were presently deeply engaged together in the
                     examination of certain localities marked upon the map.</p>
                  <p>The old feeling of happiness came over Geoffrey, he lingered on. Ilia was
                     herself again; the bright thoughts and flashes of glowing sentiment came as of
                     old. It would be pleasant to rest forever, thought the young man, in such real
                     soul-enjoyment. But a summons came from the gay circle he had left; he was
                     wanted—he must go. Most reluctantly at last did he say good night.</p>
                  <p>It was some time before he again met Ilia. About the middle of the winter it
                     was determined that a large party should be given, to welcome to their new
                     mansion those whose hospitalities and attentions had been bestowed so warmly
                     upon them since their removal thither. So aunt Edith and uncle Weldon projected
                     a grand reception.</p>
                  <p>On the morning which preceded this important and exciting affair, Geoffrey
                     passing hastily up the steps of the house, chanced upon Ilia coming down. It
                     was snowing fast, and Ilia was wrapped up as if for a journey. Just as she
                     opened the door, not aware that any one was near, he caught sight of her
                     countenance in all its sorrow, and he was deeply moved. Forgetting all his
                     former determination not to make any officious inquiries, he said quickly,</p>
                  <p>"Where are you going, Ilia? You cannot surely be going far this stormy
                     morning!"</p>
                  <p>She made some half uttered excuse, but he persisted;</p>
                  <p>"You must let me accompany you, to carry your umbrella, or else allow me to
                     call a carriage. You must not go thus."</p>
                  <p>The sad eyes were now clouded with tears.</p>
                  <p>"I must go on alone;" she said.</p>
                  <p>"No Ilia, this will not do any longer," said Geoffrey, much excited, "I must
                     and shall do as I please. I must go with you—I must help you—I will not endure
                     this mystery any longer."</p>
                  <p>They had been walking slowly on, but Ilia now stopped, as she said,</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you shall know all this mystery—but not this morning. Let me go now," she
                     said, with a pleading gesture he could not withstand, "let me go now, and you
                     shall soon know all."</p>
                  <p>With all the snow and sleet and keen wind the carriages swarmed that evening
                     thickly, depositing their brilliant loads in front of the brightly illuminated
                     mansion, Every thing was festivity and splendor. Music and happy voices were
                     blended in one unbroken harmony.</p>
                  <p>Standing in the center of their sumptuous apartments, uncle Weldon and aunt
                     Edith received their guests, assisted by their beautiful adopted daughter, and
                     Geoffrey, their pride and delight.</p>
                  <p>Many remarks were made about these young people.</p>
                  <p>"What a splendid couple!" was whispered from one to another. Of course they
                     were engaged, and he was an immense fortune, with all the other charming
                     guesses people love to make in regard to these things. Even uncle Weldon,
                     glancing with approving eye at their beaming faces, whispered softly in his
                     wife's ear, "What a fine-looking couple they would make!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had been dancing with Cecilia, and being somewhat overheated, led her
                     to a seat near the open door, courteously taking her fan to help her to a
                     little air. Standing thus, he happened to cast his eyes out into the hall, and
                     there was Ilia passing hastily through, just returned it was<pb n="154-155"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000078"/> evident, her bonnet and cloak were covered with
                     the falling snow. In that swift glance he saw it all, and she saw him. That
                     look conveyed to him such a sense of misery that he dropped the fan—the
                     courteous smile fled from his face—and making some apology to Cecilia, he left
                     the room, to follow the sorrow-stricken girl.</p>
                  <p>He mounted the stairs, but Ilia was out of sight. He did not know which way to
                     turn; the rooms were deserted, save by a few half-sleeping attendants. A faint
                     light glimmered solitary in the quiet; evidently she was not here. He mounted
                     still higher—in fact he had never been in this part of the house before, and
                     felt like a traveler venturing upon an utterly unexplored region. The music and
                     hum of voices grew more distant, and winding their way faintly hither, lost
                     their wild and festive exhilaration, dying sadly in the passages and lonely
                     apartments. Geoffrey paused in his determined onward march; he listened
                     intently; from the end of the narrow passage a faint light issued through a
                     half open door; his quick ear caught a low sob which seemed to come from
                     thence. As he stepped toward it he distinctly heard a smothered cry, as if one
                     who struggled with some grief too bitter for silence. Pushing the door farther
                     open, he entered abruptly. A little fire burned in the grate opposite, and a
                     light stood on the mantelpiece. Glancing keenly about him the young man
                     perceived the object of his search. With her bonnet thrown upon the floor, and
                     her head resting upon the table, Ilia sat weeping with stifled moans.</p>
                  <p>"Ilia!" he said, hastening toward her and raising the bowed head, "what is the
                     matter? Speak! Speak, or you will drive me mad!" There was no restraining him
                     now. She seemed stupified and bewildered by the suddenness of his coming, and
                     the wildness of his manner, and only blankly stared at him between her falling
                     tears. Geoffrey walked a few times up and down the room, and then sat down
                     beside her, tenderly taking her hand in his.</p>
                  <p>"Ilia," said he, "there is no use in my struggling any more. I will not do it.
                     I have come to know all—to-night. I love you, Ilia, with my whole heart and
                     soul. Will you accept the offering?"</p>
                  <p>Ilia covered her face with her hands, and as he spoke these words, she uttered
                     a cry, so piercing that but for the din of voices below, it must have startled
                     the echoes even there. Then it seemed as though her endeavor to control the
                     excess of feeling must strain the cords of life.</p>
                  <p>She tried to speak, but for some time was unable to utter a word: at length she
                     gasped, "Oh, Geoffrey, is this so? Tell me again if it is truly thus. But no—it
                     cannot be. This is some delusive dream—the fantasy of a disordered brain. Oh, I
                     have been so heart-sick," she said plaintively, "so heart wounded and
                     sore!"</p>
                  <p>"I know not what your sorrows are, Ilia. You would never give me the privilege
                     of a brother, to partake of them, or even allow me to be as a friend to whom
                     you might unburden a grief. In what I have said I may have given offence, but I
                     must express these thoughts. I have long battled against these growing feelings
                     of mine—it is only lately I have come to understand their full import; still, I
                     thought I would not speak of them. I thought that you wished to shun me—that
                     you saw my infatuation, and did not wish to give me hope. But even though it
                     banishes me from your presence, I must now say what is in my heart.</p>
                  <p>"Mine is not a mere passing fancy, Ilia,—I have known such. It is the true
                     conviction of every faculty of my mind, every sentiment of my being, linking my
                     life to yours with a strange intensity. Ilia, I await your decision. You must
                     speak it to-night. Do you love me, or do you not? Is it for me to hope, or is
                     my future to be darkened by this deep disappointment?"</p>
                  <p>How sweet this pleading voice sounded to the listener! Every word vibrated on
                     her answering soul with softest melody. She would have gladly died in that
                     fullness of perfect bliss.</p>
                  <p>But this must not be: even an instant's indulgence of such feelings was to her
                     nice sense of right sinful. The high principles of her nature, even her very
                     love, which was so inblended with gratitude, forbade it. The brand that was
                     upon her had never seemed so broad, so burdensome. Must she forever carry it,
                     and cast aside every bright hope that lightened her pathway, and this love that
                     had been the stimulus of her life—that had quickened with its intensity her
                     intellect, her genius, and revealed to her everything that was lovely and
                     harmonious in existence?</p>
                  <p>Her whole frame trembled, but she braced herself to the struggle.</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey," she said firmly, "this cannot be. Yet this is the proudest,
                     sweetest moment of my life. It is beautiful to be loved by you, Geoffrey,—but
                     it must not be. If I have ever imagined in my most visionary dreams that such a
                     moment as this might ever arrive, when I should know a happiness so supreme, I
                     have also known that there would be pain, deep pain mingled with this pleasure.
                     But the pain is more bitter, more terrible than I dreamed. Must I involve you
                     in my doom? I could better have borne this alone—and must you suffer too,
                     Geoffrey?" Her voice melted to the softest accents of pity.</p>
                  <p>"Then you do not love me, Ilia!"</p>
                  <p>She had recovered from her agitation, and now sat erect, though with eyes cast
                     down, as she said rapidly.</p>
                  <p>"Love you? It is not unwomanly to say this,—yes, I love you with a love even
                     beyond what you have expressed or imagined. I have loved you from the first
                     moment I saw you, and shall forever, ever love you; but we can never be to each
                     other more than we are now. I can never be—yes, Geoffrey, I must say it—I can
                     never be your wife."</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, this is cruel," replied Geoffrey, sternly. "You are sporting with my
                     feelings." But seeing her deep distress, he softened, and entreated her to
                     explain more freely.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I cannot, I cannot!" she said, in painful agitation.</p>
                  <p>"You cannot. Then I have my answer,' and he was moving away.</p>
                  <p>But Ilia followed and held him fast, pleading in her despair. "Do not be angry
                     with me! I would die rather than give you a moment's pain. Can you not blot me
                     from your memory without all this suffering."</p>
                  <p>He was as much agitated as Ilia at this moment, "I cannot," he said,
                     briefly.</p>
                  <p>"Then, if I prove to your judgment that it is better we should part, can you
                     not give me up?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not comprehend you—you speak with such mystery. You tell me that you love
                     me, and yet you wish to fly from me. What can I think?"</p>
                  <p>"As I said before, this mystery shall all be revealed. Give me but a few days
                     more and all shall be told you—and with your own clear sense, Geoffrey, you
                     will see the necessity of the sacrifice to be made. You will help me in it—I
                     shall need your support."</p>
                  <p>"But Ilia, let me have something to say. May I not also have a voice as to
                     whether this sacrifice be needed?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I will put you to the test—will you follow me whenever I desire, without
                     farther question?"</p>
                  <p>"Anywhere, to the end of the earth."</p>
                  <p>"Will you leave me, then, the moment I desire?"</p>
                  <p>"If the separation is not to be eternal, Ilia."</p>
                  <p>"No."</p>
                  <p>"Then I promise. I am at your command whenever you shall call for me." He
                     raised her hand to his lips, and hastily left the room.</p>

                  <p>RETURNING to the drawing-room, Geoffrey found that his absence had scarcely
                     been observed. Cecilia had once or twice looked toward the door, expecting his
                     entrance, but the throng of admirers surrounding her, and the constant
                     solicitations to join in the dance, as each new set was formed, gave her little
                     time for thought.<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5590-00000079"/> The brief hour so
                     eventful to Geoffrey had sped unnoticed by her.</p>
                  <p>He felt assured that Ilia loved him. Of this he could not have a doubt, and a
                     thrill of joy pervaded his heart, with all its disappointment. But what was the
                     meaning of her assertion that she could never be his wife? Dispirited and
                     anxious, he wandered about the rooms without any fixed purpose, trying to be
                     agreeable, and act the part of entertainer with something of spirit. But his
                     thoughts would wander to the lonely girl up in the high chamber, above, till
                     all interest in the scene before him was lost.</p>
                  <p>In his wanderings about in this listless way he came unexpectedly on the family
                     group,—Mrs. Dupont, Ralph, and Miss Arrowfield, now one of the favored circle
                     wherever they went; and it may be added that her sprightliness served much to
                     relieve its pompous platitude. Madeleine did not seem to have either the
                     courage or spirit to assert herself in such circumstances; but Miss Arrowfield
                     was an agreeable as well as brilliant conversationalist, which generally
                     attracted a number of intelligent persons around them where otherwise they
                     might have been deserted.</p>
                  <p>But she was not one of Geoffrey's favorites, this Eldred Arrowfield; there was
                     something too artificial about her for his taste—something, also, which he
                     could not comprehend. She had never, however interested him, and at this time,
                     as might be expected, less than ever. She noticed his absent manner, and at
                     last, receiving a very awkward reply to some of her remarks, she laughed
                     outright, and turning to Ralph said, "What would you think, Mr.
                     Luperthorp,—your cousin is in love!"</p>
                  <p>Ralph's features relaxed with one of his frigid smiles, and poor Geoffrey was
                     covered with confusion. He was glad enough when the last guest departed, when
                     in the quiet of his own room he could sit and ponder over all that had occurred
                     in that eventful hour.</p>
                  <p>But how was it with Cecilia—the beautiful and admired Cecilia—she who was
                     pronounced by all the loveliest woman in the rooms that night—the undisputed
                     queen in the brilliant assemblage of wealth and beauty?</p>
                  <p>She too was weary, and glad to reach the solitude of her own chamber. But she
                     could not sleep there; she left it and wandered still farther, tapping lightly,
                     at last at Ilia's door. Ilia was still up, sitting in front of her little
                     grate, and looking dreamily into the burning coals.</p>
                  <p>She started when she saw Cecilia, and heard her gentle, "May I come in,
                     Ilia?"</p>
                  <p>These girls loved each other truly. They had been so long as dear affectionate
                     sisters, sharing each other's joys and griefs, alive to each other's interest,
                     jealous of neglect or slight, each feeling for the other as for herself,—why
                     must this shadow come between them? It was a strange fate that made them love
                     so blindly this one object.</p>
                  <p>Ilia's heart bled, as endeavoring to shake off the moody desire to be silent
                     and alone, she affected an interest in the events of the evening, questioning
                     Cecilia in regard to its pleasures. She heard instead of answer to her
                     inquiries the wailing cry.</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey does not love me! Ah, this is the curse of beauty—to create
                     admiration which our vanity interprets as love. Once," said Cecilia, wringing
                     her hands, "once I did suppose that he loved me, but now I am undeceived. How
                     indifferent he was to me, to-night." Every one was talking of his devoted
                     attention. He followed me everywhere—and you know he is always so kind,
                     Ilia—but he was preoccupied, indifferent. I understood it all; his attentions
                     were given only because he could not be uncourteous to any. Oh, yes, I see it
                     all, I—what <emph>shall</emph> I do? This frivolity is hateful to me; these
                     smiles and flatterers oppress my heart. I only want to be with you and aunt
                     Edith!" and the weeping girl laid her head wearily on her companion's
                     breast.</p>
                  <p>Ilia had spent those few short hours after Geoffrey's departure alone with her
                     heart. Golden visions had lighted up her soul, and made her as though
                     intoxicate with draughts of some divine ether. She allowed no shadow to mar
                     their bright and brief enchantment. Ah, might she not for a little time ignore
                     the dark pathway of her life, and linger in the sweet dream of her love? Might
                     she not in this short season of <choice>
                        <sic>halucination</sic>
                        <corr>hallucination</corr>
                     </choice> compress the long days and months and years of smiles and hopes and
                     joyous festivity vouchsafed to happier souls,—comprehending all in this one
                     great rapture of her being? It had not been her lot to walk an easy path, or to
                     know much of the gladness of life by experience,—this happiness, exhaling like
                     dew, she clasped for one moment of sweet delirium to her heart. The future was
                     forgotten—only the present in its spiritual joy was with her.</p>
                  <p>But, as the shock comes to the inebriate,—that terrible something that stirs
                     every power within him, and sobers him to the realities about him—so, when
                     Cecilia broke in upon her reverie, and in the tenderness and innocence of her
                     heart laid bare her every thought, did the stings of an accusing conscience
                     rouse the dreamer to a quick sense of everything as it was. Had she wronged her
                     friend? Oh, not intentionally! but she sympathised with her in that pang of
                     despair as though it had been caused by her own act.</p>
                  <p>"My poor Cecilia—my dear, my more than sister! I would give you all—my
                     life—all—all but," she paused; "Yes, I would—I will—" she said, with a noble
                     strength, "I will give up all I love, or ever will love, for you!"</p>
                  <p>Cecilia, absorbed in her grief, scarcely heard the low-spoken words, but she
                     felt the warm pressure of the friendly hand, the consoling music of the gentle
                     voice, and was comforted.</p>
                  <p>"I think," said Mr. Weldon, glancing toward Geoffrey and Cecilia, as they sat
                     at the breakfast table, "I think it will not do to give these gay
                     entertainments very frequently."</p>
                  <p>"Why, sir?" inquired Cecilia, striving to look unconscious.</p>
                  <p>"Because, my dear, it has robbed you of your morning roses. And as for you,
                     Geoffrey, with that grave aspect you seem rather as though you had been
                     attending a funeral than a ball."</p>
                  <p>"A funeral," repeated the young man, absently, "Perhaps I have, sir,—the
                     funeral of some dead hopes that were very dear."</p>
                  <p>Cecilia's face colored crimson. "Aha-!" thought the old gentleman, "What is
                     this,—has anything happened?" But he was silent, merely saying to aunt Edith
                     when they were alone, "How inexplicable these young people are! "It is
                     impossible to follow them in their variable loves and fancies."</p>
                  <p>"Truly, it is so," echoed aunt Edith, thoughtfully.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey went to his business as usual; Cecilia wandered about the house all
                     day, without any seeming object or interest. Aunt Edith watched her with secret
                     anxiety. Dejected and silent, Cecilia seemed to shun the notice of her best
                     friend, and attributed the undeniable change in her spirits to a slight cold,
                     brought on by dancing in too airy a dress.</p>
                  <p>A day or two thus passed, when a little note was despatched, which brought
                     Madeleine, kind, good Madeleine, and she carried off the gloomy girl.</p>
                  <p>"A week with me," said she, pleasantly, "taking you everywhere, will do you
                     good, Cecilia. You are not well, you want a change."</p>
                  <p>Cecilia laughed, "I think I have had a change," she said.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey had not seen Ilia for some days. He began to be uneasy, to fear that
                     she had forgotten her promise of communicating with him very soon.</p>
                  <p>One morning aunt Edith said to him, "Can you give me an hour this evening? I
                     want you to accompany me a short distance."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey gave a cheerful assent. It was always a pleasure to attend his
                     aunt.</p>
                  <p>At dark the carriage was at the door. As they drove leisurely along, aunt Edith
                     said smilingly that she was now going to render an account of her
                     stewardship.</p>
                  <p>"What <choice>
                        <sic>stewardiship</sic>
                        <corr>stewardship</corr>
                     </choice>?" asked Geoffrey, in surprise.</p>
                  <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5590-00000080"/>
                  <p>"The yearly allowance that you left in my hands when you went to India."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, oh, aunt Edith, that was you own."</p>
                  <p>"I know, and I have done with it as I pleased."</p>
                  <p>Presently they stopped in front of a large wooden building occupying a wide
                     extent of ground. It was perfectly plain, but neat and in excellent order. The
                     butcher, the baker, the shoemaker, besides numerous venders of wares, rivalled
                     each other in the briskness of trade and in the cleanliness of their
                     windows.</p>
                  <p>They passed around to a side door, which aunt Edith opened with a private key
                     ushering Geoffrey at once into a pleasant room, well lighted and heated—a sort
                     of family room where a number of boys and girls were engaged at different
                     employments. Some were sewing, others writing, and lesser ones were amusing
                     themselves with various games, all under the superintendance of older girls and
                     one or two women.</p>
                  <p>They were all delighted to see aunt Edith, and returning their eager greetings
                     with her pleasant words and smiles, she passed on to accompany her nephew
                     through the various other parts of the building.</p>
                  <p>They visited the dining room, where long tables were set in cleanliness and
                     order, then the small rooms, heated and ventilated for various trades, then the
                     kitchens for family use, and fitted for teaching all the females, young and old
                     in turn, the art of living in order and cleanliness. They visited the suites of
                     apartments, rooms and beds devoted to the privacy of family use. The halls and
                     stairways were lighted, and every thing bore the appearance of unusual neatness
                     and comfort.</p>
                  <p>"And this is a home for the poorest in the land, and yet" said aunt Edith,
                     proudly, "it is not a charitable institution. Those that live here do not eat
                     the bread of dependence; they pay for what they get; the place supports
                     itself—but by a payment suited to their means. A master mind has brought all
                     this to a system, where those who before were compelled to live in the
                     demoralizing influence of beggary, are elevated by the sentiment of true
                     independence. Your money built the house and started the enterprise—but even
                     that, it is expected, will in time be repaid. All that live here are the former
                     occupants of miserable shanties, without furniture and without food. You see
                     them as they now are, many of them, in the thriving little business of the
                     stores—women and men working at various trades and occupations—and the girls
                     are coming forward in usefulness.</p>
                  <p>"This is but the very beginning of the experiment; we hope to have it spread to
                     an indefinite degree. There are lectures and concerts, and readings for evening
                     amusements. This evening, after some instruction to those who cannot attend at
                     day time, there will be a short lecture. I would like you to attend; can you
                     wait so long?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly."</p>
                  <p>She continued. "We can occupy a little box or place of my own, where no one
                     will have the slightest idea of our presence. Let us go—I expect they are all
                     in the school-room."</p>
                  <p>On entering they found this room well filled with men and women; coarse,
                     illiterate men and women, but anxious to learn, their faces lighting up with
                     the new intelligence of mental desire. Some were spelling and reading, some
                     writing, some even learning their letters, and all were busy, and cheerfully
                     occupied in their various pursuits.</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Edith!" said Geoffrey, learning forward and following with his eyes a
                     slight figure moving to and from through the long room—saying a word of
                     encouragement to one, stopping to more thoroughly instruct another, and smiling
                     kindly on a third—"Can it be possible! This is Ilia!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my dear, this is indeed Ilia; like the spirit of love she presides here.
                     Now you can understand her secret movements. In the Home, in the school-room it
                     is her mission to instruct, to elevate those on whom circumstances have done
                     their worst. To reach these she has to go down to the very dregs of society to
                     bring them forth; and she has done it bravely; these triumphs are all her own.
                     But let us wait, we will hear more."</p>
                  <p>Just then the movements among these unwonted pupils showed that their present
                     occupation was closed. A number of others entered, and Ilia stepped quietly
                     upon a slightly raised platform, and began arranging some books before her upon
                     a little table.</p>
                  <p>"I am going to read you, this evening," she said calmly, "from various authors
                     upon the great subject we have ever before us—Our Common Humanity. But before I
                     do this, let me say a few words to you, as brothers and sisters in this great
                     family of life."</p>
                  <p>At first Geoffrey shrank within himself. It clashed against his feeling to see
                     Ilia thus, before so many. He spoke to aunt Edith of the pain it gave him; "Any
                     publicity of the kind for one of her sex is so repulsive—so repugnant to my
                     taste."</p>
                  <p>"True, Geoffrey;" answered aunt Edith, "but only a woman, and a woman of genius
                     such as hers, can fill the place of an instructor here, adapt herself to their
                     circumstances—and do the work."</p>
                  <p>But Geoffrey soon forgot all these shrinking and unpleasant feelings in
                     listening to the earnest appeals of that sweet, musical voice, that voice
                     which, in its pathos ever reached a depth in his emotions which had never been
                     reached before.</p>
                  <p>Not only Geoffrey was charmed and spellbound with its melody, all present
                     listened with rapt attention, their rough faces turned steadily toward the
                     speaker, their earnest glances and motionless attitudes bespeaking an absorbing
                     interest in what they heard.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly a voice said.</p>
                  <p>"Will you rise, Miss Ilia? We like to see all of you when you speak to us."</p>
                  <p>"Do, do! please do," echoed a number of voices around the low room.</p>
                  <p>She arose, her pale, dark face shining with the enthusiasm of its earnest
                     purpose, while her graceful head, erect and full of dignity, seemed encircled
                     with a halo of light.</p>
                  <p>Ah, had she then known who was gazing so wistfully on her! But it was better
                     not.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she continued, "My brothers and sisters, I address you as one who knows
                     all the difficulties of the struggle you have to raise yourselves—to throw off
                     your unfortunate surroundings. But you are heroes that can achieve it. Every
                     effort you make—every triumph you gain brings its reward in the grander
                     emotions of a soul opening to its own magnitude. Would that I could impress
                     upon every one here the importance of their individuality, with all the
                     obligations and responsibilities it involves. A proper sense of obligation,
                     inwrought in thought and action, must be the basis of all that is good. A deep
                     thinker has said that a high sense of obligation embraces the true religion of
                     a life. But these words have a deeper meaning than perhaps their mere utterance
                     would suggest. Think of them! To fulfil your duty yourself, to all, and every
                     thing—what a work to perform!</p>
                  <p>"You have, each of you, be you ever so poor, a possession in one of the most
                     wonderful pieces of mechanism ever imagined, with all its priviliges free and
                     unconstrained. You have yourselves. This wonderful being, with life and soul,
                     thought, feeling, and desire. But you too often degrade it—is it not so? I
                     would like to have you roused to the ambition of independence, to the
                     determination by reason and effort to overcome all excess in earthly
                     tendencies, and allow the higher attributes of the divinity within you to
                     assert their rights.</p>
                  <p>"Now, remember, I speak again to you thus, to impress upon you the truth that
                     in the Infinite Laws of creation all are treated alike. There is no favored
                     class or grade, absorbing more of the clear dews of heaven, more of its
                     resplendent light, or having a finer quality of air to strengthen and nourish
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"I admit though, alas! that here we are sometimes utterly crowded down by the
                     presence of hard circumstances which too often strangle all our inner spirit of
                     beauty, and we come to be mere flesh and blood—living only an animal
                     existence."</p>
                  <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5590-00000081"/>
                  <p>"But ye are the heroes—ye men and women who effect a deliverance from these
                     obstacles by your own strength of purpose! Would that your histories could be
                     written in their every minutest detail! But, as nothing in the world of matter
                     is lost, so it may be in the world of mind. And perhaps," she said, with a
                     gesture whose unconscious grandeur thrilled every heart, "Perhaps it may be,
                     that in these morning cycles of time the throes and struggles of humanity, its
                     aspirations and effort towards higher things, may all in their varied
                     pulsations be registered on the invisible machinery of space, to return with
                     life and distinctness, recorded in the actions and virtues of far-off
                     generations to come.</p>
                  <p>"But this is merely fancy; let us grasp the present, and clear its difficulties
                     away, because it is right we should do so. You, it may be, are burdened with
                     the accumulations of by-gone mistakes; add no more to the difficulties of those
                     who come after you. Let the world be better—some one be a little wiser and
                     happier for your having been in it.</p>
                  <p>"Poverty you have; but beggary you must be done with. Suffer and die rather
                     than let your wives or husbands, your innocent little ones, follow its polluted
                     course. Its results are artifice, deception, and every meanness of soul. Not
                     only the aspect of the mind becomes contemptible, but also that of the body.
                     You can know the professional beggar as far as the eye can reach; his step is
                     stealthy—as though the very ground refused him a firm footing, while every
                     action is depressed, as though some inward voice from those silent intuitions
                     still feebly whispered 'Shame.' So, root it from your children's—from your own
                     thoughts."</p>
                  <p>Thus she plead with them, with a glowing fervor that warmed every heart; urging
                     them to throw away the gross life that many of them led, and spiritualise and
                     refine the attributes of a common nature.</p>
                  <p>"Let cleanliness and order take the place of fifth and disorder—all can have
                     these if they will. So, let gentleness and love take the place of rudeness and
                     harshness; particularly in homes preserve a sacred purity. Let not innocent
                     childhood become familiar with aught that is base or depraved. 'Home,' as a
                     gifted writer says, 'is the citadel of all civilization, the nursery of the
                     affections and faculties, and the refuge from temptation. And woman,' she
                     declares,' with her rising advantages, is now co-architect with man, helping to
                     bridge the way from earth to heaven."</p>
                  <p>After reading a few selections from authors calculated to please her audience,
                     as well as to stimulate the self knowledge she so ardently desired to inspire,
                     Ilia arose, as if to leave. Many gathered round her, all having something to
                     say. And so aunt Edith, followed by Geoffrey, quietly left. They had been
                     unnoticed, and passing through the dimly lighted hall the lady opened the outer
                     door with her own private key, and they passed out unseen by any. The carriage
                     was waiting and they returned home. Geoffrey was silent all the way.</p>
                  <p>On separating for the night aunt Edith asked him if he could spare her a few
                     hours in the morning before he went to business, as she wished to have a little
                     private conversation with him.</p>
                  <p>Gladly, at the appointed time did Geoffrey repair to his good aunt's room. He
                     knew that she was going to speak on that matter that pressed so heavily on his
                     mind. He needed sympathy. He was in real heartfelt trouble. Aunt Edith had him
                     come to her own apartment. He found her seated beside the blazing fire,
                     everything about her bespoke as usual comfort and peace. The windows looked out
                     on the white snow, now quietly falling, but they were so warmly shaded by thick
                     scarlet hangings, that the sense of outward cold only added to the warmth of
                     luxury within.</p>
                  <p>"Come here, Geoffrey," said aunt Edith, "bring your chair close by me. I have
                     much to say."</p>
                  <p>How deeply she pitied him. But pity is a poor word. Her spirit yearned to him,
                     and grieved with his; every throb of pain in his heart, every hope
                     disappointed, every expectation blasted, was echoed in her own. It had always
                     been thus; she could not control nor avoid this sympathy with her nephew.</p>
                  <p>He sat down beside her, in that half shaded stillness.</p>
                  <p>"I know your troubles, Geoffrey, my dear," she said, "Ilia has told me all. I
                     was surprised and deeply pained to find your feelings so much interested. I
                     have known Ilia's for some time—ever since the afternoon that we spent in the
                     gallery of paintings I have known that she loved you. It was by my advice she
                     has since kept away so much; I thought it best on her account that you should
                     meet as seldom as possible. I did not know then that your feelings were
                     interested, neither did Ilia. She thought then that you rather disliked
                     her—that every sentiment and feeling was occupied with love and admiration of
                     our beautiful Cecilia."</p>
                  <p>"Did you think so, too, aunt Edith?"</p>
                  <p>"I did," she answered, "and I will own that I was very happy in the thought.
                     But to return; Ilia has told me all as it is now, and begged that I would tell
                     you all her history—every circumstance of her past life. My poor girl! With her
                     high tone of thought, of principle, of sentiment, it is hard that fate should
                     link her with such circumstances. Have you no supposition who she is?"</p>
                  <p>"Not the least!"</p>
                  <p>"Nor even suspect?"</p>
                  <p>"No."</p>
                  <p>"Then I will tell you frankly. Indeed Ilia entreated me to do so. She is the
                     daughter of a criminal in the state's prison,—a prisoner for the crime of
                     murder—Peter Ackley. And Geoffrey, this girl, whom I love, is also Leil, the
                     beggar, whom you once so disinterestedly helped."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Edith!" he exclaimed, starting from his seat. "<emph>Can</emph> this be
                     so? Oh, no, it cannot be so! I would have remembered—there would have been
                     something that must have reminded me. Oh, no, no, it cannot be," he again
                     repeated musingly. "that girl who sat shivering on the gate-way step, that
                     morning."</p>
                  <p>"But it is the truth, Geoffrey. When you left home, I endeavored to carry out
                     your wishes about Leil and the widow Neil's family. The result has been as you
                     see,—I need not follow the matter step by step, I found that Leil, as her mind
                     became developed, showed great powers of intellect; but, having grown to the
                     age she did without any training or control, it was difficult for others, and
                     even for herself to govern the impetuosity of the forces within her. I was
                     sometimes quite discouraged. She seemed desirous to do as I wished, and when I
                     would speak to her of what I knew you desired her to be, she always became
                     completely subdued, and ready to submit to anything. I was often surprised at
                     the accuracy with which she remembered you, and the vivid impression left on
                     her mind of your personal appearance.</p>
                  <p>"But I found that to do her any permanent good she must be removed from the
                     associations surrounding her. About this time Mrs. Dupont was commencing her
                     enterprise of the Dupont Institute, and I exerted my influence to have Leil
                     placed there. I was sorry afterward that I did so. Your aunt Dupont was quite
                     unwilling to receive the child, because she hardly came under the rules of
                     entrance,—her girls must be of respectable and unimpeachable parentage. But my
                     persuasions over-came all obstacles, and she was at length admitted. I will
                     hasten through the unpleasant part of my narrative. The effect of this
                     unwilling reception, together with the fact of her recent inferior position,
                     followed her as a blight. It was not spoken, but implied, that all the members
                     of the Institute were her superiors. And this, to her sensitive feelings,
                     continually kept before her in every word of instruction and advice, became
                     utterly unendurable, and finally raised such a storm in the poor girl's breast,
                     that there was constantly some outbreak taking place. Mrs. Dupont misunderstood
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Dupont," said Geoffrey, contemptuously, does not know anything!"</p>
                  <p>"She certainly does not understand human nature—at any rate she did not
                     Leil's—and the next thing I heard was that Leil<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000082"/> was to be publicly expelled from the school. I
                     was ill at the time, confined to my room, and knew not what to do. But Leil
                     decided for me. One day Nabbie came upstairs to tell me that a young girl was
                     in the kitchen, crying passionately, and declaring that she must see me. Nabbie
                     had told her that I was ill, but she would take no denial. I knew it must be
                     Leil, and sent word for her to come up immediately. Scarcely waiting the
                     permission the poor child rushed to my bedside, and burying her face in the
                     coverlet sobbed as though her heart would break. When by soothing words I had
                     brought her to composure she told me—with indignation and shame quivering in
                     every limb—that they were going to beat her. I could hardly credit this,—but
                     Leil's unquestionable truthfulness,—her deep distress—as well as my knowledge
                     of Mrs. Dupont's severe ideas of discipline, convinced me that the child had
                     been harshly dealt with."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey thought of her father; of his indomitable pride; and of those fatal
                     lashes, that had swept with a cruel stroke all ideas of right from his mind,
                     and crushed every expression of his noble nature into one long cry of
                     revenge.</p>
                  <p>"Leil told me," continued aunt Edith, "that she had broken away from those who
                     held her. 'You will let me stay here,' she prayed, 'and I will love you, and
                     wait upon you, and—and that young gentleman,' but this she spoke low, as she
                     cast down her head, 'will thank you for it.'"</p>
                  <p>Poor Ilia! thought Geoffrey, with melting pity; but he spoke not, he only
                     listened as aunt Edith proceeded.</p>
                  <p>"Of course I let her remain; and I soon found that the only management she
                     needed was kindness. Kindness opened the passage to such a volume of love and
                     devotion as I had hardly supposed existed in any human breast. I could detain
                     you many hours relating the countless proofs I had of this. I found very soon
                     that her capacities were of an unusual order. She learned everything that I
                     could teach her readily, and seemed eagerly to grasp for more. One day, after
                     Mrs. Dupont had been making me a visit. Leil came to me, all radiant, 'Oh, aunt
                     Edith,' she always called me this, 'I have lost the black spot!'</p>
                  <p>"What my dear?" said I, amazed.</p>
                  <p>'It is gone! it is gone! Oh, I am so glad!'</p>
                  <p>"What is gone?"</p>
                  <p>'The black spot.'</p>
                  <p>"Why, Leil, I do not know what you mean," I said, "What is the black spot?"</p>
                  <p>'It is something all the girls at the Institute have. I had it very bad. It is
                     a black spot on the heart, that makes one hate every body, they say. But it is
                     all gone—I do not hate Madam Dupont a bit. I felt, as though I could say that I
                     was sorry I had been a trouble to her—that she had done a great deal for me.
                     But I dare not speak, she always looks so grand.'</p>
                  <p>"I smiled within myself at this fanciful idea of the black spot. I suppose it
                     is <choice>
                        <sic>alagous</sic>
                        <corr>analogous</corr>
                     </choice> to that of the flame of love in the heart. I had heard of the black
                     heart—but Leil's conception of a distinct mark created there through the action
                     of the passions was suggestive. And I always found her just so artless,
                     truthful and perfectly frank in all her proceedings, and no one's heart it
                     seemed to me, could be more free from stain—whiter or purer than Leil's.</p>
                  <p>"About this time you wrote me about Peter Ackley. I read her your letter in
                     regard to him, stating your belief that Leil was his child. She was much
                     overcome, and recognised at once that it was so. During his stay in prison and
                     subsequent trial she was unremitting, and devoted. An affection sprung up that
                     developed the tenderness and delicacy of her nature. And then I began to
                     perceive, for the first time, a strong attachment for you. All she learned—all
                     she did was with reference to pleasing you. Her father had told her of you—of
                     what you had done for him, and her gratitude had been inflamed. She always
                     thought you saved her life when you delivered her from that great dog,—but
                     afterwards—she said, you had more than saved her life. Because, aunt Edith,'
                     she would say, I have come to know you, and you have delivered me from the
                     death of all these faculties that now lead me to life and truth and
                     beauty,'—and I might have added have given to my own life a new impetus, for
                     the bringing forward this bright, living soul, had added a charm to the painful
                     loneliness I experienced when you left me.</p>
                  <p>"As I have told you, by the exertions of Mr. Bernot, and the discovery of some
                     illegal technicalities in the verdict, her father's life was spared. Her joy
                     then knew no bounds, that her dear father should be saved from the disgrace of
                     a forced death. It was such a happiness, such a relief, that she bore his
                     incarceration for life with great equanimity. You have sometimes asked me where
                     Ilia went in these forced journeyings when she would be absent so long a time.
                     Once a month she visits her father and is allowed to remain with him some
                     hours. He is much respected where he is, and it would really do you good,
                     Geoffrey, to see him—he has become such an intelligent noble man. Through the
                     unwearied intercessions of his daughter he is indulged in many ways. He is
                     provided with books to read, and by her instruction, and tenderness and
                     affection, is now a man of much thought and reflection.</p>
                  <p>"But to return to Ilia. On leaving Mrs. Dupont's establishment she advanced so
                     rapidly in learning that I was obliged to provide her with the best
                     instructors. She had shown also an aptness for drawing and painting, but the
                     teacher that I desired for her was so constantly engaged that he could not come
                     to the cottage. He had however another pupil not far from us, and proposed that
                     in order to accommodate matters Ilia should go thither, and the two be
                     instructed together. And thus commenced our acquaintance with the beautiful
                     Cecilia.</p>
                  <p>"Leil remembered her well. She was the lovely girl who so fascinated you on the
                     morning of poor Leil's fright with the dog. It was at her father's gate you met
                     Cecilia."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Edith! how you amaze me! Yet, in regard to Cecilia, I have often imagined
                     that I must have seen her face before—but where I could not tell. It appeared
                     as if it had been in some dimly remembered dream."</p>
                  <p>"Between the two girls," said his aunt, "an intimacy sprung up, and they really
                     came to love each other as sisters. Cecila was often with us, and she became
                     much attached to me. She was an only child. Her mother was dead."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, I recollect," said Geoffrey, "my alarm on that birthday morning when
                     Madeleine and I, driving past the house, saw a funeral cortege leave the gate.
                     I thought at first it might be the fair girl whom I had seen."</p>
                  <p>"Her father," continued aunt Edith, "was taken ill about this time, and I had
                     it in my power to do him many kindnesses. His circumstances were somewhat
                     altered,—he was not quite so wealthy as was supposed. But I was surprised when
                     on his death-bed he entrusted his daughter to my care, in preference to placing
                     her with her wealthy connexions."</p>
                  <p>"I don't wonder!" said Geoffrey, enthusiastically, "No one can know you, aunt
                     Edith, and not trust and honor you."</p>
                  <p>"You are a foolish boy," she said smiling," but the tears stood in her eyes, as
                     she fondly laid her hand upon his.</p>
                  <p>"But I forgot to tell you that Leil's true name was Cecilia. This was the name
                     her father had given the baby in the last letter he wrote his wife. Honest
                     widow Neil corrupted it to Leil. So when I had my two Cecilias, we shortened
                     one to Ilia, in order to designate one from the other.</p>
                  <p>"As Ilia became older she evinced a growing and constant solicitude for those
                     in the walks of life from which she was snatched; so much so that it suggested
                     to me the idea of the work you saw yesterday—of making the effort to raise the
                     degraded by instruction, and accustoming them to better things on a level above
                     that misery and squalor in which they merely existed as animals.</p>
                  <p>"I can hardly give you an idea of the ardor and judgment and persevering
                     industry she has carried into her work. I am happy to say the widow Neil has
                     been a<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5590-00000083"/> great help to us. She has
                     been transformed into the good, systematic housekeeper, instructing others by
                     her example. She lives with her family in the building, and has a general
                     supervision—each inmate taking regular turns under her instruction in the care
                     of the house. I believe, now, Geoffrey, I have told you all. It remains for me
                     but to advise. I will own that I am grieved at this attachment. We are all
                     unconsciously influenced by the opinions of those with whom we mingle; I had
                     other hopes for you, and I am disappointed. I cannot help being tenacious of
                     your rights in society—it would be a sad trial to me to have you or your family
                     lowered in its estimate. It has been my proud hope to have you by the force of
                     your own excellence take the place from which you were unjustly driven. But
                     there is no one more jealous of your honor and rights than the poor girl whom
                     society brands with the disgrace which has fallen upon her father. She and I
                     have spent many hours in talking over it, and her hopes and expectations for
                     you have been as high as mine. And really, Geoffrey, when I reason from myself
                     alone, and rise above the slavish bondage that makes us fear to do this or
                     that, because of what others may say or think—then I feel that you should marry
                     Ilia in spite of the world's opinions, for no better companion can you meet.
                     But waking up to life as it is, and knowing its petty exactions, its inflexible
                     laws of social martyrdom to those who thrust themselves in the way of being its
                     victims, I tell you candidly, that if you conquer this attraction I shall be
                     glad; but if you cannot, then, Geoffrey, I must submit."</p>
                  <p>He raised her hand to his lips, he could not speak.</p>
                  <p>"Now, all I ask, Geoffrey, is that you be not precipitate. Wait at least for
                     one month. Do not strive to see Ilia—I know that she would herself prefer that
                     you do not—and then calmly make up your mind."</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey did as his aunt desired. He remained with the family, and he and
                     Cecilia were much together. She was rather reserved, and he was somewhat under
                     restraint; the slightest whisper had come to him that he had acted so as to
                     lead to the supposition that he was attached to Cecilia. He remembered his
                     early admiration of the beautiful girl, and his ardent expression of it. He was
                     ashamed of himself; he loved her still, and still admired her, but this other
                     passion so much stronger, overmastered him; it seemed as if reason, thought,
                     and every feeling were absorbed in it. But had he done any thing to cause this
                     reserve—to throw this cloud of seriousness over her buoyant nature? He thought
                     he would speak to aunt Edith about it—she had evidently noticed Cecilia's
                     depression—or to uncle Weldon; but after all he could not. It might seem vain;
                     and may be it was his fancy. So it passed on; he was kind and attentive, and
                     she received his attentions with her sweet, quiet dignity. But she did not ask
                     him to go out with her now. She had still her throngs of adorers, and was
                     engaged in various ways, and also spent a good deal of time with Madeleine; so
                     that Geoffrey, deprived in a measure by his love, of both his friendships, was
                     doubly to be pitied.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">SEPARATION.</head>
                  <p>SLOWLY indeed the month seemed to glide to our hero; but he remembered his
                     promise, and supposed himself altogether dispassionate, really believing that
                     it was with an unbiassed judgment he looked at every side of the matter.</p>
                  <p>But alas, our poor human judgment! Geoffrey was as much as any man alive to the
                     opinions of society in regard to the different shades of caste and class; these
                     are so firmly imbedded in us from infancy, that they become, to a degree, a
                     fixed principle of our nature; but he was hardly as much enslaved by these
                     opinions as many others—his cousin Ralph, for instance. He was more broad and
                     generous in his estimate of his fellow beings, had more respect for them as
                     individuals vested with inherent rights. Then there was such great pity and
                     tenderness swelling in his heart; if Ilia and Cecilia could but have reversed
                     positions, he thought he could more readily have given her up. This loneliness
                     of hers, this isolation from the world seemed to form a closer bond around the
                     generous chivalry of his nature, and he felt a desire to sacrifice himself, and
                     defy public opinion, exclaiming with the bold Van Artevelde: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l rend="ti-2">"I know my course——</l>
                           <l>And be it armies, cities, peoples, priests,</l>
                           <l>That quarrel with my love, wise men or fools,</l>
                           <l>Friends, foes, or factions—they may swear their oaths,</l>

                           <l>Their wits, their words, their counsel; here I stand,</l>
                           <l>Upon the deep foundations of my faith</l>
                           <l>To this fair outcast pledged."</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>And then Ilia's grandeur and dignity of nature had a deeper foundation than any
                     mere accident of birth. Her genius linked her with those lofty hights which the
                     mere butterflies of earth could never reach. Was not this distinction of nature
                     more truly regal than any pomp or glitter of jewelled crown and tinsel?
                     Fortified with all this reasoning and determined resolve, when the month was up
                     he sought the home of the lonely girl—lonely, though, we can hardly call her in
                     the strict acceptation, for many were around her. But lonely in the absence of
                     that soul-sympathy and companionship for which she ever so deeply craved.</p>
                  <p>But she was truly alone, in every sense, on the evening in which he resolved to
                     visit her. It was a cold and stormy night, the dismal sharp wind and driving
                     sleet swept through the streets, and struck icily against the one window of
                     that little room where she was seated.</p>
                  <p>She had drawn her table in the front of the fire, to make her preparations for
                     the next day's instruction; maps, books and drawings were scattered upon it;
                     but she sat listless gazing into the burning coals. Her work had lost much of
                     its charm. Where was that energy on which she prided herself so much? She tried
                     to make a beginning, and shame herself into something of activity. Ah, how
                     selfish we are, she thought, every recurring little disappointment that affects
                     our own personal feelings, will banish all usefulness and thought of better
                     purposes; it cannot—it must not be so! And with a determined effort, she would
                     rally her thoughts again to the work before her. But only to relapse once more
                     into that dreamy aching desire, Oh, that he would come! But thus she had
                     whispered these last weary weeks; on every evening she had sighed the same
                     weary sigh, until she was really sick and sore-hearted.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, he has forgotten," she said, "I might have known this. How much he has to
                     carry his thoughts beyond this mere life of feeling!" And ought she not to be
                     glad that he did not suffer with her? Had she not resolved—finally resolved?
                     Still he might have come once more, even if it were to say good-bye. Ah, how
                     startled she was, how her heart fluttered at the sound of that low tap at her
                     door. She could not raise her voice to bid him welcome, but he opened her door
                     and came in unbidden.</p>
                  <p>"How very pale you are, Ilia!" he said, as he took her hand, "and you tremble
                     so much,—have you been sick? Why did you not let us know?"</p>
                  <p>But she had not been sick. She assured him of this. Hers had been but the
                     internal suffering that wears life away, but there is no outward fever to
                     distinguish this. Ilia said nothing of her grief to him, for Geoffrey was
                     rapidly pouring forth the story of all that he had endured—of his torments, his
                     waverings, and final resolves.</p>
                  <p>"And you know all," she said, "of my poor father—my low origin?"</p>
                  <p>"I do, Ilia, I have made up my mind that I will brave the voice of the world,
                     and make you my own in spite of derision. Indeed, Ilia, my great love will not
                     allow me to do otherwise."</p>
                  <p>Again that cry as though some deep agony would rend life asunder—a wail as of a
                     last expiring hope.</p>
                  <p>"Oh why did you not help me, Geoffrey?" she said. "Why did you not rouse<pb
                        n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5590-00000084"/> my pride and anger, and say you
                     spurned such mean alliance, and wondered that I dared to love you, knowing all
                     that I did? But now you come with a noble love, with a great self-sacrifice,
                     you bind me closer to you, and add a double pang to my weak determination. How
                     can I say what I have to say in the face of all this? Oh, Geoffrey, this is
                     more than I can bear!" and she covered her face with her hands while her whole
                     frame trembled as with some fearful shock.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was inexpressibly troubled. He endeavored to soothe her, but it was
                     for some time in vain. At length he said,</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, dearest Ilia, I cannot understand this excess of feeling. You distress
                     me beyond measure. What have I done—what can I do? If my absence will relieve
                     you I will depart at once, even though it break my heart to do so."</p>
                  <p>Making a powerful effort to control her emotions and steady her voice, she
                     lifted her head, saying,</p>
                  <p>"Stay one moment, Geoffrey! Bear with me a little longer, and I will speak."
                     But as she attempted to proceed her voice again failed, and again she broke
                     into an uncontrollable passion of tears. In a few moments, however, she
                     forcibly shook herself free from this overpowering feeling, and once more
                     raised her head, while her face assumed somewhat of its old dogged expression,
                     coming up to Geoffrey like a dim reminiscence of the forgotten Leil.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she cried, "I will be free! I will be strong! But—but it is so bitter,
                     Geoffrey—so bitter," and yet another sob. "It tears my heart, my brother, my
                     best friend, to bid you this farewell. Yes, farewell—it must be—farewell
                     forever!"</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey started in amazement. "Ilia!" said he, "what does this mean? Are you
                     mocking me? Surely you are,—you cannot be in earnest. You say you love me
                     beyond all else, and yet we must part. What then am I to understand? Has it
                     been all a delusion—a mere phantom of words? You have been deceiving me, Ilia.
                     You cannot love me, or you would not sport thus with my feelings."</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey," answered Ilia fervently, "it is because I love you that I speak
                     thus."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot see this; indeed I cannot;" he returned hastily, "If I have
                     determined to risk everything,—if in sounding the depths of my own heart I find
                     my love superior to all fears for the future,—surely, Ilia, if you do really
                     love me, you might be willing to give up some of your schemes for my sake, and
                     let us join together to meet the worst that may come."</p>
                  <p>"But you do not understand me," she said, in despair, "you do not think how I
                     am breaking my own heart for your sake. If my life could save you from grief
                     and disappointment, how freely would I give it. I love you beyond anything
                     living. I love you beyond myself. It is not indelicate in me to speak thus,
                     Geoffrey. I, on the verge of a living death—death to you, death to myself in
                     every sentiment of personal happiness. Yes," she added, gazing intently upon
                     him, "mine is no common love. Yours is but the growth of a few matured months;
                     mine is the growth of a life—the life from which I date—the birth of the soul
                     to consciousness."</p>
                  <p>"Ilia, you speak lightly of my devotion."</p>
                  <p>"Let me proceed," she said, almost sternly, "Let me proceed while I can." She
                     spoke rapidly, as though afraid her strength might fail did she not hasten to
                     the uttermost the fulfilment of her purpose. "On that wintry morning when I, a
                     poor beggar-girl, scarcely knowing I was human, guided but by passion and
                     instinct, met you for the first time, Geoffrey, you came to me in your human
                     tenderness, as some great inspiration; the film of darkness cleared from my
                     sight, and through the power of a quickening sentiment my soul became truly a
                     living thing." Her voice lowered reverently, as she said, "Thenceforth you
                     became my adoration, my religion. I shaped all beauty in your form; all that I
                     knew of joy, all that I felt of aspiration were called forth by the same
                     intense love. It helped me to control my wild, unmanageable nature, and
                     stimulated me to a sense of justice and right. Through this great love I have
                     learned to love all life. When my poor father came back, and I heard from his
                     lips of all you had been to him, and all you had done for him, there seemed to
                     be a reconsecration of my whole being. I grew to intelligence. I longed to be
                     wise and good—to show my gratitude. I loved my father more because he knew you;
                     it made him sacred in my eyes. But why prolong the recital of all that this
                     love has been to me—my genius, my strength, my dream of beauty! You know from
                     aunt Edith's own lips what she has been to me; but she knew not that her
                     presence and her words were ever feeding that flame that illuminated my life.
                     Then I became desirous that others should be as I was. I desired to reach those
                     in the depths where you had reached me, and bring them to the better things I
                     had attained. I vowed my future to this work. But since your return I have
                     wavered, I have felt my weakness, and learned to know that I have not yet
                     subdued the evil inharmonies of my uncultured early years.</p>
                  <p>"When I saw you prefer another to me, even though I knew it must be so, even
                     though in imagination I had often dwelt with pride and pleasure on this
                     anticipated admiration of one so supremely lovely, so worthy of your
                     devotion,—then the old passions beset me. I was embittered; I hated the noble
                     girl who had done so much for me; who, knowing what I was, had fostered and
                     loved me as a dear sister, had elevated me by her counsels, had sustained me by
                     her strength; next to you and aunt Edith I owe her most in the world, and yet I
                     hated her. But my conscience has scourged me. I have suffered all the torments
                     of perdition. Forgive me, dear Cecilia! You are now among those for whom I
                     shall sacrifice much. Geoffrey, listen to me. There is one who loves you—I
                     cannot say as I do—but who loves you as you deserve to be loved; who is fitted
                     for you in every way, who will add to your honor in life, who will be your
                     crown of happiness." Seeing him about to speak, she entreated him by an
                     expressive gesture to hear her yet a little longer.</p>
                  <p>"Geoffrey I own—yes, I own that I have wavered in my duty—that I have been
                     nearly carried away by delusive dreams—that I have indulged in the wildest
                     imaginings. But my deep, my abiding love for you, a love that is above myself,
                     superior to myself, has brought me right, has awakened me to a sense of
                     justice, and I have resolved, firmly, fully and determinedly resolved that you
                     shall never unite your fate with mine. I understand and <choice>
                        <sic>apprecifate</sic>
                        <corr>appreciate</corr>
                     </choice> the great sacrifice of self you would make for me; but it only
                     strengthens me in my determination to prevent it. I love you too well, am too
                     jealous of your rights before the world, to have your wife a convicted
                     murderer's daughter! To have your wife a creature taken from the very dregs of
                     the earth. No, Geoffrey! the slightest breath of impurity or sin shall never
                     tarnish the honor of your fair name with my consent. And Geoffrey," and she
                     laid her hand gently on his arm, "what I ask of you is help in this—manly help.
                     Make it easier for me, by using no more entreaty, it will only agonize us both.
                     I cannot, I dare not change. Think of your aunt Edith, of her husband, of their
                     hopes in you—and of that other heart that loves you. Then think of what you owe
                     yourself—your capacities—the powers that God has given you to rise unburdened
                     to the highest that is to be attained—think of all this—and then let us part to
                     meet no more. Do this, Geoffrey, do this strongly. Ah! do help me! help me! I
                     know you will—won't you?"</p>
                  <p>He listened in silence, his head bent low, as her voice ceased he still sat
                     motionless. They were both silent, but the echoes of that low, sweet voice were
                     still lingering in his inmost soul. There was a great struggle—but he had
                     caught something of her self-sacrificing spirit. He had followed her reasoning,
                     and saw all its force. He thought of those at home—of the future—of aunt
                     Edith's ambition for him, and of this strange girl's love, which had so
                     mysteriously stirred all the latent powers of his character. He felt now equal
                     to any undertaking; he felt the force of a genius that must some day assert
                     itself. He felt all this, and knew<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5590-00000085"/>
                     the unbending determination of that will that now ruled him. Still, he would
                     make another effort; but she stopped his words.</p>
                  <p>"Do not be so cruel, Geoffrey,—I will fly from you. Let us part dear, undying
                     friends this moment. Wait no longer."</p>
                  <p>He arose mechanically, as though acting under the high behest of a will
                     stronger than his own.</p>
                  <p>"It shall be as you say,—farewell dearest—dearest farewell!"</p>
                  <p>She laid her head upon his shoulder with one long, last sob, touching her lips
                     to his cheek. He clasped her in an endearing embrace, and then rushed from the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>Slowly, and with a half unconscious sense of deep pain, he reached his home as
                     one in a dream. During that long night till morning dawned he paced his
                     solitary room; he reasoned, he struggled, and at last he conquered.</p>
                  <p>On the next morning he told his aunt Edith that it was all over. She wept in
                     very sympathy for she knew what he—what both had suffered.</p>
                  <p>"But I am rejoiced Geoffrey, indeed I am rejoiced," she said, as she wiped the
                     tears from her eyes. "It is best it should be thus. I knew of Ilia's love and
                     determination long ago. As I told you Geoffrey, on that night after our return
                     from the gallery of paintings Ilia confessed to her deep and abiding love for
                     you. And by my advice, since then she has kept as much as possible apart from
                     you. But she did not know then, neither did I, that you had the slightest
                     regard for her. When she knew this, then I feared the temptation might be too
                     great even for her resolution; I hardly dared to hope; but she is a noble girl,
                     a true, a great-hearted woman, and may the thought of her sacrifice and
                     devotion inspire you with strength to endure and fortitude to overcome the
                     present bitterness of separation, Geoffrey, my own, dear child."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"ALL OVER."</head>
                  <p>AND it was indeed all over. As Geoffrey had resolved, this heart-struggle was
                     now confined to his own breast. He would make no more attempts to influence
                     Ilia. And he had learned to know her well enough to be aware that where what
                     she considered principle and duty were involved, no power could alter her
                     determination.</p>
                  <p>But it was a great satisfaction to him to be so well assured that he was truly
                     loved. There is no more ennobling stimulus to a man than to be the object of
                     sincere affection. While the love (or that which is misnamed love) of a mere
                     flirt or coquette degrades and ruins by its blandishments, the love of a true
                     woman rouses every manly quality to higher excellence.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey was now resolved to take his destiny in his own hands. He had been led
                     on through his short life by influences which, though kind and beneficent, were
                     not of his own choosing. He determined henceforth to lay out his own course,
                     and set his mark high.</p>
                  <p>He knew Ilia's views of what men and women were, and what they might be; he
                     knew that, let his ambition aim ever so high, there was one watching its course
                     who would always glory in its utmost attainment. Thus he reasoned and resolved,
                     and the effort quieted the turbulence of his feelings. Ilia should always be
                     this soul-friend to him,—this secret instigator of thought and intellect.</p>
                  <p>A great bereavement—the loss of any loved object—sickens us to all interest in
                     our present pursuits; we turn wearily aside from that which has been our daily
                     employment, necessity or pleasure. But determination and perseverence will, in
                     time, work a cure; and so it was to be with Geoffrey.</p>
                  <p>He went on with his daily avocations, trying to cover with a pleasant smile the
                     wound that was still freely bleeding. He did this, too, for aunt Edith's sake,
                     feeling that she was anxious and uneasy about him. She and her husband now
                     proposed that he should travel, and see a little more of the world. Mr. Weldon
                     assured him that he could be readily spared from business for a few months. But
                     the young man declined this kindly proffer. He knew their secret motive was to
                     divert his mind, and he was ashamed to need such aid; to leave business, aunt
                     Edith, and all who needed his presence, when that brave girl unfalteringly kept
                     her post, carrying a far heavier burden than he had ever borne.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith was also seriously unhappy in regard to Cecilia. The proud girl was
                     reticent, but yet aunt Edith knew well the unspoken language of those feelings
                     she endeavored to conceal. Hers was perhaps as severe an ordeal to pass through
                     as well could be imagined. She had not only a deep disappointment to struggle
                     with, but also the bitter mortification of slighted hopes. The only thought
                     that supported her was that Geoffrey did not know this, that he was unconscious
                     of the havoc he had worked. Like Ilia, though not to the same extent, she had
                     cherished a remembrance that was fed and fostered by the circumstances of her
                     after life.</p>
                  <p>She nobly acquitted Geoffrey of all blame—perhaps more fully than he
                     deserved—because undoubtedly his impetuous and thoughtless admiration might
                     have justified the supposition that a deeper sentiment accompanied it. But it
                     was only as a kind, good brother these attentions had been paid, Cecilia
                     whispered to herself: "It was my vanity that misled me."</p>
                  <p>Still, with all this reasoning and calling up of pride to her aid, she suffered
                     much. Had she but some object in life—something to do! She had lost all relish
                     for amusement and the society of her gay young companions. Her emotions had
                     lost all the spirit and fire of their life, and it seemed as if no effort would
                     save them from a slow dying out. Yet she was silent about all this, unconscious
                     that every motion, every expression of her sweet countenance involuntarily told
                     the weary tale.</p>
                  <p>It was a sad situation for aunt Edith to be placed in—she whose sympathies
                     throbbed so truly with these young hearts. Cecilia and Geoffrey were kind still
                     and affectionate to each other; Geoffrey was attentive to her every want; but
                     there was a dark shadow between them, they were reserved and uneasy, and
                     appeared happier when apart.</p>
                  <p>"Do not," said Mr. Weldon to his wife, "do not, Edith, let yourself be so
                     distressed about these young people. There is wonderful elasticity in these
                     young hearts. It will come all right, you will find that it will; we cannot but
                     feel with them, but we must not make ourselves unhappy. I know, my dear, your
                     tenderness for both Geoffrey and our sweet Cecilia; but time works wonders; so
                     cheer up, Edith."</p>
                  <p>Still aunt Edith could not but grieve, not that she feared exactly for their
                     ultimate safety, but their health might suffer, the bloom of their present
                     life, that ought to be so bright, was gone, and she feared this deep trial
                     might cast its sombre hue over their entire future.</p>
                  <p>But a happy circumstance occurred that seemed to suggest a way, a most
                     agreeable way to make a change for Cecilia. Ralph resolved to travel. His
                     family were to accompany him. They had met with a severe trial lately, they had
                     lost their little son, and poor Madeleine was in deep affliction. Ralph had
                     proposed they should visit Europe, thinking change would be beneficial to all.
                     He was somewhat changed of late, he had lost much of that measured placidity,
                     that self-sustained consciousness, and was restless and nervous. Perhaps it was
                     the loss of his son, for he with all the rest had placed high hopes on him. At
                     any rate he entered into this plan with unusual energy for him. Mrs. Dupont was
                     to stay at home, but Miss Arrowfield was to accompany them. At first Madeleine
                     strongly objected to this; but she was overruled. The little Madeleine was to
                     go also, and it was necessary she should have her governess with her. Miss
                     Arrowfield had lately been installed into that additional duty. "And then, my
                     dear, your own health," said Mrs. Dupont, "has suffered so much<pb n="170-171"
                        xml:id="VAC5590-00000086"/> lately that I must insist that you shall be
                     relieved from all care, and Miss Arrowfield will be a most pleasing companion
                     for yourself." But Madeleine could not be satisfied. It preyed upon her. She
                     could not submit to this close personal companionship of Miss Arrowfield again.
                     They had been for sometime completely estranged, still she would not interfere
                     with Mrs. Dupont's or Ralph's desire to have her instruct their little girl;
                     but she felt that she might resist any attempt to force upon her the society of
                     one so extremely distasteful in every sense. Unfortunately Miss Arrowfield
                     heard of the objections Madeleine had advanced. She then entreated Mrs. Dupont
                     and Ralph that they would allow her to remain, "Much as I deplore dear Mrs.
                     Luperthorp's strange antipathy to me, yet I would die rather than give her a
                     moment's uneasiness. My health is of little consequence," she added, while the
                     tears fell fast from her eyes, "Let me labor with you, dear Mrs. Dupont, and
                     die if it must be. I have had my reward—you and kind Mr. Luperthorp are
                     satisfied with me."</p>
                  <p>Ralph was affected, and Mrs. Dupont seemed deeply moved. Such devotion was
                     truly touching—what could be done? This dear, heroic girl must not be
                     sacrificed. But aunt Edith at that moment was announced, she had heard of their
                     intentions, and had come in all haste to see if Cecilia could not accompany
                     them. Cecilia was not well, and a trip across the water was just the thing she
                     needed.</p>
                  <p>This relieved all difficulties. Madeleine was too happy to have Cecilia with
                     her; she would have other female companionship and all was right. There was
                     nothing but the busy note of preparation, and in this pleasant anticipation of
                     visiting new scenes, and the bustling activity of making arrangements,
                     Cecilia's spirits began to revive.</p>
                  <p>When the time of parting came, and the beautiful girl, with tears in her
                     lustrous eyes, faltered a last farewell, Geoffrey felt a sudden throb of pain,
                     that almost overcame him. Cecilia was very dear to him, he was hardly conscious
                     how much <unclear>so.</unclear> The possibility of losing her had awakened some
                     old dormant feeling. "Madeleine," he said, with much agitation, "you will take
                     good care of her. I did not know I should feel this separation as I do. And
                     Madeleine," he whispered, "you know she is so fascinating, that—that I hope you
                     will keep—I mean you will keep away those triflers—"</p>
                  <p>"O, I understand!" said Madeleine, laughing, and taking his hand for a last
                     adieu, "I will guard her well, dear Geoffrey, for your sake. Farewell!"</p>
                  <p>Lonely and deserted seemed the house after the departure of the joy-expectant
                     party. The day was bright as spring could make it, but everything within looked
                     dark and cheerless—its young spring life was gone, and even aunt Edith and her
                     ever cheerful husband were infected by its gloom.</p>
                  <p>They sat up very late round the library fire (for the evening had grown chilly)
                     talking of Cecilia. Aunt Edith remembered so much that was endearing about her,
                     and the knowledge that this girl, so much her pride, silently loved that other
                     one who lived as it were in her heart's core, rendered her doubly dear.</p>
                  <p>By and by long letters came, descriptive of the various places through which
                     they were passing. The summer months were spent in a hasty but delightful trip
                     through England, Ireland, Scotland, France, and Switzerland. The autumn months
                     found them in Italy.</p>
                  <p>Geoffrey read these letters with remarkable interest. He had not supposed that
                     Cecilia possessed such exhuberant fancy, or such unbounded enthusiasm. As time
                     wore on from weeks to months, she appeared to have recovered the sprightly tone
                     of her mind, and to live in great enjoyment, meeting many friends and
                     journeying with them through these inspiring scenes.</p>
                  <p>The party had been through the rural districts of England, they had visited its
                     busy towns and fine cities, with all the objects of historic interest, palaces,
                     castles, and ancient battle grounds, where knights of old sacrificed their all,
                     and bled and died, not for the liberties of humanity, but for some despotic
                     dynasty or crown. Now all was still, and thriving hamlets and rich fields
                     flourished where once fierce passions and bitter strife made hill and vale echo
                     with the notes of warfare.</p>
                  <p>Then our travelers pushed over the borders into Scotland, that name so full of
                     traditional lore. They trod its blue heather, thinking of the struggles of its
                     sturdy people for that freedom of thought and action which had developed to
                     such high attainments, to such prosperity, strength, and fitness in
                     everything.</p>
                  <p>Then across the channel to Ireland, so neglected by tourists, and yet so
                     abundant in nature's most impressive creations. That little isle on the western
                     coast of Europe quite fascinated them with its exceeding beauty.</p>
                  <p>They traversed it from north to east, from south to west, admiring its present
                     evidences of elegance and culture, and its ancient monuments of wealth and
                     grandeur—passing through cities and towns, and splendid highways with their
                     bordering mansions, pleasure grounds and parks, and all the surroundings of
                     refinement, to those wild regions where the ocean washed its pebbly beach, or
                     dashed foaming against cliffs and headlands, whitening their rocky sides, and
                     where chasms, waterfalls, and deep glens alternating with the rich profusion of
                     inland verdure, charmed with their picturesque loveliness and their romantic
                     intricacy.</p>
                  <p>"Only think", wrote Cecilia, "I have wandered by those sparkling rivers, the
                     Avonbeg and the Avonmore, where they unite their waters in that lovely vale
                     immortalized by the poet's fancy. And I have scrambled up the high mountains of
                     the Gattee, and the Maam Ture, and looked over a panorama of unsurpassed
                     beauty, with many of the ancient ruins in sight—old cathedrals, moss-grown
                     abbeys, still bearing traces in their sculptured arches and ancient gildings of
                     a magnificence almost regal. And I may add that I have seen with the poet: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"The rush thatched cottage on the purple heath</l>
                           <l>Where ruddy children frolic round the door,</l>
                           <l>The moss-grown antlers of the aged oak,</l>
                           <l>The shaggy locks that fringe the colt unbroke,</l>
                           <l>The bearded goat with nimble eyes that glare</l>
                           <l>Through the long tissue of his hoary hair.</l>
                           <l>As with quick foot he climbs some ruined wall,</l>
                           <l>And crops the ivy which prevents its fall."</l>
                        </lg>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thence they journeyed to France, visiting of course its far-famed metropolis,
                     and passing through the country districts to get a glimpse of its peasant life.
                     Here things were as they had been a hundred years before—the same quaint style
                     of dress, the same primitive simplicity of living. The aged matron sat on her
                     low stool in the doorway, quietly knitting, while the family cow grazed on the
                     little patch beside her. There were no fences skirting the roadside to keep the
                     creature from trespassing, and so the ancient dame watched and worked, as her
                     grandmother and great-grandmother had done before her.</p>
                  <p>Then to Switzerland—on the Rhine. The letters that came from there were full of
                     enthusiasm at the unparalleled grandeur of the scenery, and Cecilia was so
                     happy—much to Geoffrey's chagrin at the prospect of a lengthened stay being
                     made to explore its wonders. But in a few days, to the surprise of all, another
                     letter came announcing the welcome though unexpected news that they were all on
                     their way home. No reason was given for this change of purpose, save that
                     Madeleine was not very well, and wanted to get back.</p>
                  <p>As might be supposed, there was great rejoicing in the household at this return
                     of its bright star. Geoffrey was more pleased than he dared admit. He had been
                     in some anxiety lately, fearing lest Cecilia might meet with some one who would
                     interest her affections, and cause her to forget him. It seemed natural that
                     such should be the case; he knew from Madeleine's letters that she had been
                     very much admired. He had no right to wish it otherwise, and yet the idea was
                     not a pleasant one to contemplate.</p>
                  <p>Yet Geoffrey, although it may seem contradictory, had not forgotten his loved
                     Ilia. He thought of her as fondly as ever, with as much tenderness. As when we
                     are bereft<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5590-00000087"/> reft of some cherished
                     one by death, in the first flush of the terrible bereavement we shrink from
                     naming the lost one's name, or recalling their looks or words; fresh, bursts of
                     anguish follow every such recollection, and the heart-cry of our anguish is,
                     "Oh that we could sleep away these weary hours in unconscious oblivion!" But
                     time with its softening influence chastens the harsh blow, and those memories
                     we once so dreaded come to us with a subdued and softened charm. We love to
                     linger over them; they are our cherished pleasures; every distinct look we can
                     recall, every remembered word, is a treasure untold, and every wish they
                     uttered when with us becomes to us a sacred duty. So was it with Geoffrey.</p>
                  <p>Ilia was to him as a past dream—as a something lost that could never be
                     restored. She had been a vision in his path, that had illuminated all the
                     capacities and instincts of his soul—but like a vision she was gone, leaving
                     but the remembrance behind.</p>
                  <p>Time had healed the smart, but these awakened emotions and softened
                     remembrances still lived, to give him a higher taste for all that was good and
                     true, to widen and deepen his sympathies. His mind was no longer moody; he
                     could even bear to hear of Ilia, and to talk of her to aunt Edith, and all her
                     desires regarding himself and Cecilia became to him quite a pleasure.</p>
                  <p>And the party returned before the short winter days had fairly set in. Cecilia
                     was delighted and happy to get home; but she seemed to be the only happy one in
                     the company. Why did they come home? No one seemed to be able to answer, the
                     intention had been to remain all the winter in Italy, under its warm beautiful
                     skies. If Ralph was questioned he became angry, he had wished to stay, he had
                     been so much benefitted by the change. If Madeleine were spoken to she would
                     only cry and sob as though her heart must break. Ralph was much improved in
                     health but did not seem to be in temper. The haughty, supercilious tone of mind
                     that had laid in a sort of torpid languor was now a more active principle, he
                     was severe, impatient, and yet at times more softened and genial. Once after a
                     burst of violent passion he laid his head on his mother's breast and wept
                     bitterly, and asked softly, could she forgive her sinful erring son.</p>
                  <p>"You sinful, my dear boy, what is the matter?" said the stately mother,
                     soothingly; the utter impossibility of such a thing rendering it quite evident
                     that her Ralph was more unwell than usual to-day. "Shall I give you a
                     sedative?"</p>
                  <p>But Ralph made no answer.</p>
                  <p>Miss Arrowfield was, as ever, the indefatigable assistant. Matters had got into
                     much confusion at the Institute during her absence, and it seemed necessary
                     that she should remain there for the present to get everything straight
                     again.</p>
                  <p>And aunt Edith, and uncle Weldon and Geoffrey were all happy again, for Cecilia
                     was with them on these long winter evenings by the pleasant library fireside.
                     Thus the winter passed. Before the early spring had opened, Geoffrey and
                     Cecilia were forever pledged to each other. They understood each other now.
                     Cecilia knew every thing. With a deeper self-knowledge Geoffrey had offered
                     himself with all his faults, his indecisions and waverings, to the generous
                     girl. She had accepted the gift, for she loved him even as he was, forgetting
                     the slight wound to her vanity, and believing in the sincere affection of his
                     heart. Ilia would still be to her a dear sister, she said to Geoffrey, "I now
                     understand many things that were before inexplicable;" and to her own heart she
                     whispered, "Can she have sacrificed herself for me?" Well she remembered that
                     evening when she had owned to Ilia her love for Geoffrey, and well she
                     remembered the poor girl's anguish, and those words, "Geoffrey shall love
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Geoffrey," she would say, "how lonely poor Ilia will be! I understand that
                     deadness of heart that comes when we have no love. I ought not to say this
                     either, I knew I had many to love me—and aunt Edith, a host in herself—but I
                     mean, you know, it is so lonely without that undivided love which is our
                     inspiration—our," and the beautiful face flushed as the rose "our
                     soul-love."</p>
                  <p>"Dear Cecilia," said Geoffrey, "may you never be disappointed in it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," sighed Cecilia, "if Ilia had but a sister, who could come near to her,
                     and sympathise closely with her! I never had a sister—how I have longed for
                     such a friend! But I had a brother,—a poor, unfortunate brother. He left me
                     long, long ago. Poor fellow—where is he now?" Tears filled her eyes. She looked
                     sadly up into Geoffrey's face. The question struck his heart with a strange
                     thrill.</p>
                  <p>"A brother!" he exclaimed, "Ah, may it—can it be?" and he quickly took from a
                     side pocket a worn leathern case, from which extracting a letter evidently long
                     folded and sealed, he handed it to Cecilia.</p>
                  <p>"This is the very time," said he, "these are the very circumstances under which
                     it was to be opened and read. Poor Weston! Read it, Cecilia."</p>
                  <p>The lines were faintly traced and faded, Cecilia's voice trembled as slowly she
                     deciphered the dim words. The letter ran thus:</p>
                  <q>

                        <body>
                           <div type="letter">
                              <p>"DEAR SISTER CECILIA:—I am dying, and with my last breath I desire
                                 to give you to one whom I love best of all. Geoffrey Luperthorp is
                                 my last, best friend. God bless you both forever. He will tell you
                                 all.</p>
                              <closer>
                                 <salute>From your own brother,</salute>

                  </q>
                  <p>And he did tell her all. Cecilia wept as she listened, and yet she was happy;
                     it seemed a ratification from heaven of the solemn compact they had both
                     entered into. Her poor brother, so easily led into vice, and yet not
                     vicious—the story of his death brought him nearer to her again, bereft of the
                     shadow which had made his name a reproach. She remembered him now as in the
                     early days when they had loved each other so well.</p>
                  <p>"This accounts," said Geoffrey, "for the strange prepossession I felt for
                     Weston the first time we met. It seemed as if I must have seen him before. And
                     now I know what it was—it was the reflection of the beautiful image you stamped
                     upon my mind when you first appeared to me, on that cold winter morning. You
                     were much alike."</p>
                  <p>Long they talked together over all the strange circumstances which had
                     transpired since that morning to bring them where they were, and to unite them
                     in a love that dated its first existence from that chance meeting years
                     ago.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Edith and her husband, as may be supposed, were much gratified with this
                     engagement. It fulfilled their earnest wishes.</p>
                  <p>"Did I not tell you, Edith," said Mr. Weldon in triumph to his wife, "how it
                     would result? Ah, these young people are wonderful mysteries—but we old folks
                     need not give ourselves so much trouble about them. If we could help it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, that is it," said aunt Edith, "If we could help it!"</p>
                  <p>When Ilia was told the news she buried her face, as she listened, in the folds
                     of aunt Edith's dress. She had not yet entirely mastered her powerful
                     feelings.</p>
                  <p>"But it is all right, aunt Edith," she said, after a long struggle, "It is
                     right that Geoffrey should love the good, the beautiful Cecilia. They are
                     fitted—heaven-born for each other. And I have my work still, dear aunt Edith—my
                     work to which you know I am vowed, and to which I was for a brief, maddening
                     time recreant—my life-work, to lift from the depths of ignorance and
                     degradation those who are engulfed as I was once. And my dear father too—yes—I
                     will again renew this solemn vow, and to my latest breath live in this, my high
                     duty, and 'learn to love it.'"</p>

                  <p>THERE were dark shadows hovering around the stately Luperthorp mansion, which,
                     alas, were too surely deepening daily. Ralph and Madeleine were now totally
                     estranged. There was no apparent tangibility in the difficulty, and yet they
                     mutually shunned each other.</p>
                  <p>There had never been, however, that close communion of feeling between them,
                     that living for and to each other's happiness, which should exist in married
                     life. Too much dominance had been exercised on one side, too much submission on
                     the other. But Madeleine was now much changed; she was sullen and obstinate,
                     and would not be forced into anything.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dupont was sadly perplexed. She had never possessed much penetration into
                     the feelings of those around her; it was long before she saw how matters were,
                     and then only in part. But she was altogether bewildered,—what could it mean?
                     Ralph would give her no satisfaction, and Madeleine was more than ever
                     reserved. All Mrs. Dupont could do was to go to her dear Miss Arrowfield, (who
                     still remained at the Institute) and pour out her grievances in her ear. Poor
                     old woman! she was not being prepared for the blow that was about to fall.</p>
                  <p>In that other household, where love and peace and promise reigned, great
                     preparations were going on in this early spring. The great wedding was to come
                     off. Geoffrey and Cecilia were to be married on the coming week.</p>
                  <p>Old Thomas was delighted. "He always knew," he said to his faithful Nabbie, who
                     now seldom left the kitchen fireside, "he always knew that master Geoffrey had
                     too much spirit and pride to have anything to do with that dark girl—for his
                     part he liked to know who people's fathers and <choice>
                        <sic>grandfafathers</sic>
                        <corr>grandfathers</corr>
                     </choice> were. The young master was now going to marry a lady, and a beautiful
                     one too, and this was as it should be."</p>
                  <p>"Whew!" exclaimed the stronger minded Nabbie, 'people who live in glass houses
                     should not throw stones,' what worse are you for nobody's ever knowing your
                     father?" This was a home thrust that silenced poor Thomas. "That dark girl has
                     a big human heart; she has been a good friend to me and mine, and I don't see,"
                     she added, with a slightly sneering tone, "why people can't be ladies and
                     gentlemen without being born with a silver spoon in their mouths."</p>
                  <p>"But, Nabbie, you always were a simple body. 'Tis'nt for you to judge. God
                     Almighty knows best; and," he continued cautiously, remembering the rebuff he
                     had received, "you know that nobody knows who she is. I have tried to find
                     out,—I have listened, and put this and that together; but all I can make of it
                     is, that the day she came to us—and poor enough she was—she would make the
                     mistress keep her. Yes, she would—I knew that—because when I followed her up
                     stairs, and before the door was shut I heard her cry out, she would stay, that
                     she would!"</p>
                  <p>"And you have given yourself a great deal of trouble," answered Nabbie, her
                     honest old heart now raised to scorn, "you have, indeed! had you come to me I
                     could have told you."</p>
                  <p>"And ye didn't tell me!" said the old man in angry amazement.</p>
                  <p>"I didn't"</p>
                  <p>"And why."</p>
                  <p>"Because the mistress told me not to say any thing to yourself, or any one
                     else."</p>
                  <p>This was not at all satisfactory, he would have it that the mistress would not
                     tell a simple body like her anything, and not him. There must be some reason
                     for it; he must have it.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Thomas, ye know ye're rather given to fret and worry, and trouble
                     yourself about what's not always your business, and Thomas, if I'm a simple
                     body, ye're a curious body, and a little given to talking. We women get the
                     credit o' that, always, but the mistress knows best who to trust."</p>
                  <p>Thomas was highly indignant at this; he scolded and stormed, and expressed his
                     opinion pretty freely as to the capacity of his aged partner to form correct
                     judgments on any subject, until he remembered that there was a secret to be
                     found out, and then he changed his tone.</p>
                  <p>"And now, Nabbie, you will tell me all about who this girl is, and I will be as
                     secret as the grave, you know!"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Thomas, ye might not be able to keep it, and I will not put a straw in
                     the poor thing's way—let all that's past and gone be buried. That's the way, my
                     old man."</p>
                  <p>But the wedding was close at hand, and in the general rejoicing of the
                     household, all else was forgotten.</p>
                  <p>The next day at noon the marriage was to be duly consummated.</p>
                  <p>On the evening previous Geoffrey wandered out. It was a bright, starlight
                     night, and although late in the spring, the air was cool, and every star
                     twinkled with the brightness peculiar to the sharp, frosty atmosphere of an
                     earlier season.</p>
                  <p>This beauty of the heavens, and rest of all around, was in happy unison with
                     the young man's feelings. He had but one desire unfulfilled, might he not
                     indulge it? It would be the last of its kind. Might he not look once more upon
                     the pale, dark face that had held such strange witchery over him? Even Cecilia,
                     he thought, would not object to this. He still wandered slowly on through the
                     quiet streets, until he reached the well-known building,—Ilia's tomb, he felt
                     it to be. Passing round the side of the house, he opened the private door with
                     the key which he still retained, and entering followed the long passage, now
                     deserted, to where the hum of voices led—he knew that Ilia was there. Into the
                     little private room where aunt Edith first introduced him, he entered and sat
                     down in silence. His whole soul was riveted upon that one object. She was still
                     there, that same being of power, bending over those rugged men and women,
                     fashioned in nature's plainest mold, laboring still perseveringly to stimulate
                     the neglected channels of thought, and stir to intelligence by the patience of
                     constant love the inert faculties of their being. Never before had the work
                     seemed to him so pregnant of meaning, so truly noble. If we hope to advance in
                     the present and future, he pondered, we must raise to a higher standard the
                     human intellect, with all its qualities, moral, spiritual and affectional.</p>
                  <p>There were many men and women gathered together there, whom he had not seen on
                     his former visit. The place was crowded. Sometimes in passing in and out among
                     the different groups, Ilia would approach so near to where he sat that he could
                     see the gloss of her smoothly braided hair, and the working of her features;
                     and the sweet tones of her voice penetrated his hiding place, still striking
                     that chord of sympathy in his soul—thrilling as the plaintive cadence of the
                     æolian harp—freighted with the deep melancholy of an aching heart.</p>
                  <p>How pale she was, and how deeply sad! He felt that with her it was far
                     different than with himself; she lived intensified in that love which was now
                     to him but a dream.</p>
                  <p>Poor <choice>
                        <sic>Iilia</sic>
                        <corr>Ilia</corr>
                     </choice>! She too cherished one desire, which she hoped she might dare
                     indulge.</p>
                  <p>On the brilliant wedding day there was one sitting in a far-off corner of the
                     church, unobserved in the glitter and blaze of fashion. One who gazed wistfully
                     down the broad aisle to see the bridegroom enter. As he stood before the altar,
                     she whispered low to her own consciousness,</p>
                  <p>"Let me, ah, let me, before that sacred vow is plighted, fix my eyes on him for
                     the last time, and imagine him all my own!"</p>
                  <p>And with the privilege of thought, she compassed in those few brief moments all
                     those visions of untold happiness, those hopes and joys through which she had
                     been so wildly carried in that hour of unutterable intensity when first she
                     knew that she was really, and truly, and sincerely beloved.</p>
                  <p>But now it was past; the irrevocable words were said, "I pronounce you man and
                     wife." Now he was another's. The<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5590-00000089"/>
                     dream was all ended, the fantasy was over. and with a fervent prayer for
                     strength, she gave him up.</p>
                  <p>Again she looked, and as they bent in prayer a gleam of golden light,
                     struggling through the rich stained glass, rested upon the graceful head of the
                     young bride, studding the orange blossoms in her hair, till they flashed like a
                     tiara of brilliants, crowning her as with a diadem of richest promise, and
                     resting soft as a halo on the bowed head of the bridegroom.</p>
                  <p>"May it be ever thus with them!" murmured the lonely heart.</p>
                  <p>Ilia now turned to leave, and before the splendid cortege, amid the hum of
                     congratulations and the magnificent harmony of organ tones, had reached the
                     porch of the sacred edifice, she was far on her way to that humble home, to
                     begin again with renewed vigor her life work.</p>
                  <p>And must we leave her thus? Shall we know no more of Ilia? Life's real
                     progress, its grandest march, is not always with the showy phalanx. The efforts
                     of a humble and true life may tell more in future generations than the pomp of
                     a hundred popular and fashionable charities. Misnamed charities, having no
                     adaptation to the real wants of humanity. The genius of Ilia's soul was in her
                     work, it lived through her, and where there is life we expect
                        <emph>Immortality.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the pageant is waiting. Crowds of carriages are drawing up to receive the
                     fluttering, richly robed wedding guests. Mrs. Dupont is there, her dignified
                     bearing enhanced by a black velvet robe. A dress whose splendor suited well her
                     age, and calm, imposing style. She looked indeed the one to rule and be obeyed.
                     Madeleine was there too, but she appeared pale and careworn, and Ralph walked
                     by her side, more frigid and stern than ever. But what meant those deep lines
                     on his face? He did not complain, but his countenance was thin and ghastly.
                     Geoffrey shook hands with him at the church door,—he was not going to follow
                     the company. It was the last time they ever met.</p>
                  <p>That evening the proud Ralph Luperthorp stealthily left his home, to be never
                     more recognised as its master; to make his name a by-word, a disgrace; to be
                     shunned and jeered at; to give up the affection of fond hearts, the respect of
                     those he venerated. He knew all this; these thoughts had been gnawing like a
                     worm at his vitals, and yet he went.</p>
                  <p>It was a sad, a humiliating record of artful triumphs, of weak purpose, of
                     vanity, of self-indulgence. Yes, Ralph Luperthorp left his mother, his wife and
                     child, and fled with her into whose snare he had fallen—the heartless, the
                     designing Eldred Arrowfield.</p>
                  <p>But he fancied he had wronged her, and must redeem it thus. Oh, blind,
                     misguided Ralph Luperthorp, had you only the penetration to discover that she
                     who has spread her toils for you these many years is not the one ever to become
                     a victim! Oh, unfortunate Ralph Luperthorp, with all your pride and self-love,
                     how you have fallen, yet do not know that it is you who are the victim! But he
                     was deceived, and with his high, chivalric sense of honor—although he could
                     basely desert his wife—he must make all the reparation possible to one who
                     declared with bitter tears, that for his sake she had lost her good name. When
                     the proper proceedings had been gone through with, if it were possible, this
                     woman, whom he no longer loved, but whose flatteries and artful blandishments
                     had gained an irresistible control over his spirit—this Eldred Arrowfield, the
                     serpent who had crept into his household and whom its young mistress had
                     unwittingly warmed at her hearthstone—should become his wife.</p>
                  <p>They had sailed for Europe before the full consciousness of this degradation
                     had reached his family.</p>
                  <p>With closed doors, and in the deepest seclusion the family lived. Madeleine had
                     long secretly dreaded this result. Her suspicions had been roused, and her
                     heart cruelly tortured for many long months, and this wretched sense of
                     approaching humiliation had been the cause of the abrupt termination of their
                     recent tour. The fears she felt had nothing tangible to give them shape, and
                     still she knew that <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l rend="ti-3">Trifles light as air</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>And then she had so venerated Ralph; although he had never been to her the
                     husband whose loving heart might have encouraged and strengthened her young
                     life, yet she was proud of him, and had had felt the most implicit trust in his
                     wisdom and integrity.</p>
                  <p>But Madeleine's character rose with the emergency beyond the expectations of
                     her warmest friends. Cecilia and aunt Edith, who had always loved, and were now
                     truly sister and mother to her, felt a still added interest from her deep
                     devotion and constant care of Ralph's mother.</p>
                  <p>Poor Mrs. Dupont was an utter wreck. Never strong minded, she could not rise
                     superior to the affliction. With the nervous prostration of body took place
                     that of the mind also, and she sunk into almost utter imbecility. It was very
                     painful and humiliating to see that once proud head shaking with nervous
                     tremor, and the helpless hands feeling vainly for her boy, while the feeble
                     whining voice cried ever with a pitiful pathos,</p>
                  <p>"Where is he? My Ralph was always a good boy—<emph>he</emph> could not do
                     wrong!"</p>
                  <p>But Ralph was far away. Only rumor for a long time answered the sinister
                     question, "Where is he?"</p>
                  <p>On what road to infamy and ruin did he travel, the hope and pride and
                     representative of the honorable Luperthorps?</p>
                  <p>Daily the old woman repeated her <unclear>querulous</unclear> question, but no
                     answer came.</p>
                  <p>Rumor said that Ralph had purchased an estate in the south of France—that he
                     was living a life of retirement and solitude.</p>
                  <p>But obscurity was not the destiny for which Eldred Arrowfield had planned and
                     plotted. The wealth which the unhappy man placed at her disposal, was but a
                     part of the harvest to be attained through his destruction, and before long
                     rumor again whispered that as the center of a fashionable, if somewhat doubtful
                     circle in the brilliant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">salons</foreign> of Paris,
                     Eldred, courted and flattered, was attaining the end for which she had risked
                     all. Her end, whatever might be the end of those who had <choice>

                     </choice> themselves with her fate.</p>
                  <p>At length there came a letter from Ralph for Geoffrey. In its style there was a
