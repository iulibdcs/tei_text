DEAR READER, " lend me your ears!"-or, rather your eyes, which must serve as ears in your acquaintance with me-and I will relate to you a narrative which, if it have no other effect, must, from its truthfulness enlist your interest and attention. 1"Truth is strange--stranger than fiction"-and it is not necessary in a city like this, for a writer who is " posted up" in its mysteries and miseries, to draw upon his imagination for materials for a story. Without further preface,then, I shall at once proceed to impart to you " what I do know," from actual ob- servation. Perhaps you will remember the following paragraph which appeared in the local de- partment of one of the New York dailies- the only paper, by the way, that refused to suppress its publication, notwithstanding that I used every argument to induce the proprietor to do so. I told the heartless, purse-proud man that the conductors of every other journal, on hearing my reasons for wishing its suppression, had promised that it should not appear, his only reply to which was--"So much the better-we shall have it exclusively!" But to the para- graph : 1"DESPERATE ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE.-A young girl named Eveleen Wilson, of re- spectable appearance, who stated that she was lately from Ireland, attempted to com- mit suicide by jumping from one of the wharves on the North River, on Tuesday night last. She was, however, rescued, by a policeman, who, after much difficulty, i succeeded in rescuing her from a watery a grave. She would not give any- reason for i making the rash attempt, but we suppose E that love was at the bottom of it."  c The young girl alluded to in the para- i graph just quoted, is the subject. of the ih following narrative, and there are a dozen a persons in this city at the present time, and I at least three in Australia, that will at once t 3   remember the events connected with hi eventful. history. r, It was about nine o'clock on the evening s preceding the publication of the paragraph "alludedIto, that I was walking briskly along B West-street, on my way to my hotel, which , I was anxious to reach before a thunder a shoWver, which had been for some time brew-  t ing, should break over my head. As I i passed hurriedly along, flash after flash of 3 vivid lightning would dart athwart the sky, a lighting up the broad Hudson, which In the r distance beneath its glare, resembled a lake t of ink, and illuminating for a single instant -the piers and shipping. At length the huge drops which foretell a drenching shower, r began to descend, and as I was about start- - ing off on a run, I heard a sudden splash in - the water at the foot of one of the wharves, , followed immediately by the cry of " help!" rproceeding from a man. I bent my eyesin, the direction from whence the sound pro , ceeded, when a vivid flash of lightning revealed to me the figure of an individual standing on the string-piece at the end of the wharf, with his arms extended, in the act of plunging. Suddenly altering my course, I broke swiftly for the point which I have mention- ed, and reached the spot just as the man alluded to, made a plunge into the water The rain by this time began to descend in torrents, and bending over the end of the dock, I peered into the turbid water, and could just distinguish the dim outline of two human beings struggling desperately. For a moment, no sound escaped either party, but as a sheet of vivid flame lit up the scene and a stunning lcrash of thunder re-echoed in the vault of'heaven, I perceived by the star which for an instant glimmered on his coat, that a policeman was endeavoring to rescue a woman from drowning.  "Help!" he again shrieked.  "Here!"I answeredi as springing into a yawl-boat which the lightning had revealed to me, moored fast to the dock,I cut the painter with my pocket; ^  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7813-00000004"/> knife, and pulled her by the aid of the dock- j logs to the scene, which I reached just in c time to seize the man by the collar as he 1 was disappearing beneath the water. I quickly succeeded in getting thtem both into the boat, for the woman, with the in- ( Etinct of a drowning person, clung fast to the I policeman, and was not long in reaching an inclined plane at the mouth of the slip, with i slats Mnailed thereon, placed there by the  boatmen as a landing-place for passengers seeking transit to and from the shipping in the stream. By the time I made this landing, the po- liceman, who from sheer exhaustion had lain panting, in the stern of the boat, had so far recovered as to render me some assistance in getting the female out and stretching her upon the stairs. "I b'lieve she's gone, after all," said he, as he passed his hand over her face, and then rested it upon her heart--" she's as cold as ice, anyhow, and her heart don't beat a bit. She came very nigh -fixing me off, too- if you hadn't made your appearance just as you did, my birth would have 'been vacant, sure, and no chance for a captaincy." ". Run for a carriage!" said I, not heed- ing his remark-" let us take her where we may obtain assistance instantly. She can- not be dead yet, for she was not in the water long enough!" Starting off at once, he soon returned with the vehicle desired, and in a short time we conveyed her to the residence of a physician under whose skillful treatment we soon had the satisfaction of observing symp- toms of returning animation. Where am I V' she said, as she slowly opened her eyes, and gazed anxiously around the room; "where am I?-Oh William!" and again she relapsed into unconscious- ness. I felt, I knew not why, a strange interest in this young creature the moment I caught a full view of her pallid countenance. She was apparently quite voung-not more than eighteen-and her appearance denoted re- finement and delicacy. Her fair complexion, chestnut hair, and large blue eyes bespoke a sanguine temperament, a heart keenly alive to all the best feelings of humanity, and a disposition not at all calculated to struggle with this cold and heartless world. She grasped tightly in her hand an exceedingly fine cambric handkerchief, on one corner of which the policeman called my attention to the name Eveleen Wilson. While the physician was applying restor- atives, the idea struck me that it would be better, if possible, for the sake of the poor girl, to keep the affair from being made pub- fic, and turning round, I was about to request the policeman to say nothing about it, when I found he had disappeared. Thinking, Bhowever, that I could, By calling at the dif-   ferent 'newspaper offices, keep the matter quiet, I paid no further attention to it at the time, but lent my whole attention to the fair object of my solicitude. In a few minutes she again opened her eyes, and when she was perfectly restored to consciousness and a sense of her position, I ventured to make some inquiries concern- ing the circumstances which led to her rash attempt at self-destruction. "O sir,' she replied as an expression cf pain settled upon her youthful countenance, "do not ask me-I know 1 have done wrong -very wrong-in attempting to, rush un bidden into the presence of my Creator- but I was wild, frantic-I knew not what 1 did, but I will try to abstain from such at tempts in future." "My dear young lady," said I, " you mubs not suppose that it is any feeling of mere idle curiosity that induces me to inquire into your affairs-believe me, I am actuated by nothing save a desire to serve you." ( I am. satisfied that such is the case," she replied " and from my soul I thank you, but I cannot, must not, impart to you my history. I can only say that if you knew my story, you would pity me-indeed, in. deed you would!" "1 do already pity you "' I exclaimed, "and I am satisfied, my dear Miss Wilsol, that if you knew me you v uld make-. a- confident of me." She looked fixedly at me for a moment when she heard the sound of her own name, and at length tremulously inquired; (' Where did you learn that name?" I pointed to she handkerchief which she still held in her hand. "True, true," she exclaimed, "I had forgotten that-but you will not divulge it -I know, I feel that you would not injure me willingly." "I would die first!" was my reply- come, confide in me."  She gazed in my face awhile as though shewould read my inmost thoughts, and then sighing heavily, she said- "Do not press me to make any revela- tions to-night-I am weak-very weak- 'my thoughts are unsettled. and I do not feel equal to the task-to-morrow, when I am stronger, I will talk to you." "Till to-morrow, then," said I, "I will bid you good-night. In the meantime en- ' deavor to compose yourself, and rely upon my friendship." Then taking the physician . 'aside, and requesting him So pay the invalid evkery attedtion, at tihe same time expressing my willingness to meet any demand which he might make in the way of fees, I took the necessary steps to prevent the publica- t tion of the incident, and then went to my i hotel, where I was soon in bed, dreaming of Eveleen Wilson. The next morning at ten o'clock I called   upon, the fair patient, but was grieved to 1 &amp;earnthat she was too unwell to converse. She had been flighty, the doctor said, from I the time that I -had left, and any excitement ] woult be dangerous to her. It was a. sad disappointment to me, for my curiosity to learn the history of the young female, had become absolutely painful. I was forced to c exercise patience, however, so I left, and the t next day, at the same hour, I called again. I found her more composed, but yet not well enough to converse. I extracted from her i a promise: however, that the next day she would grant me an interview, and impart-to me something of her history. Accordingly on the third day I called again, but what r was my mortification and surprise, at learn- ing that she had taken her departure early in the morning, no man knew whither! The doctor handed me a note which he had found upon' a table in ,the room in which she had been an invalid, addressed- to "the kind stranger who had befriended her," and tremblingly breaking the seal, I read as follows:-- "MY KIND FRIEND :-The interest which you have manifested in the well-being of an utter stranger to you, and one moreover, whom circumstances seem to be greatly against, speaks loudly, in favor of your real -"goodness of heart, and merits a better re- turn than silence on my part. I should be ungrateful, indeed, were I to leave you en- tirely unsatisfied with regard to myself, and yet I dare not make you acduainted with the circumstances which led me to attempt the commission of an act, the bare recollection of which causes a thrill of horror to rush through my frame, and leads me to regard myself with abhorrence. I can only tell you that I was born in Ireland, of highly ret spectable parents, who are both-dead; that I am the victim of a most singular persecu- tion; that without ever in my life having in- jured a single human being, I have been hunt- ed from place to place, tracked through the world like a deer pursued by hunters, fol- lowed with a pertinacity which shows a settled determination on the part of mypur- suers to destroy me, and rendered almost frantic by the difficulties that meet me at every turn. I am certain-it would serve no purpose to make you acquainted with my whole history. I should only be involving you in difficulties from which you would find it hard to escape, without in the least relieving myself. Under such circum- stances, I deem it my duty to leave you in perfect ignorance as to my whereabouts, and at some future day, perhaps, Providence may sO order it that we may again be thrown in each- other's society. And now, my kind friend, accept the sincere thanks of a young and alpaost heart-broken girl, who deeply feels t e great sevices you have tendered   her,and who, while memory holds hermtseut will never forget your more than brotherly kindness and attention. Farowell, and be lieve me, yours, till death. - - - ....-   1  EIVLEEN WIlOw n I will not attempt a descriptiona of my feelings upon reading this note, the conteN of which only served to add fuel to the fie of curiosity which was already consuming me. .For a whole month I searched every nook and corner of the city, and made every inquiry which would be at all likely to put me upon her track; I even went so far as to insert a small advertisement in the Herald, calling-upon her to make her ple of abode known to me, but all to no purpose, and I at length gave up the- search in de- spair, and had almost ceased to think of the circumstances detailed in the foregoing chapter, when one night as I was discussing my supper at a fashionable restaurant in Broadway, my attention was attracted by hearing the name of Eveleen mentioned by one of a party in a box next to .the. one in which I was seated., I ceased eating, and listened attentively, for the mention of that name at once revived the recollection of what had passed, and the old feeling of curiosity took possession of me with tenfold power. "Are you sure it is Eveleen .  Our Eveleen " inquired the speaker alluded to, earnestly. "Not a doubt of it!" replied the party iaddressed, " and if it had not been for-the interference of a d-d policeman and another individual who interested himself in her be- half, she would now have been lying snug and safe at the bottom of the North River, by an act of her own, and we should have been spared all further trouble concerning her."        ^ The reader may readily believe that by this time I had lost all relish for any food save that of information; so, noiselessly laying my knife and fork upon the table,  leaned back against the partition that sepa- rated the two boxes and listened eagerly. "'Well," said the first speaker, "'we must try some other game-if we can only suc- ceed in ruining her reputation , it will be sufficient for our purpose. Wha twe want, if I understand the matter properly, is to in- duce old Wilson to change his mind regard- ing his will, and I am well satisfied, from his strong religious prejudices, that if we , can produce proof that she is npt only an abandoned wanton, but a heretic, he will cut her off with a shilling." I "What is the old man's opinion with re- r gard to her mysterious disappearancesfrom, i Ireland ." inquired Speaker No. 2. I "He knows not what to think," answered r the party addressed; "-he is almost-iticon r solable for her loss, but he clings tphe hop I that she will one day be restored to him2 ;* X /   &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7813-00000005"/> The party in conversation did not dream that ihere was anybody within hearing, and I listened-undisturbed to the most horrible plot for the overthrow of innocence and vir- tue that ever was conceived. 'I had heard enough to satisfy me that poor Eveleen had not in the least mis-stated her position in lfie--I became satisfied of the fact that par- ties--and powerful ones-were at work'to Mast her fair fame--I had heard them ad- mit that they had first succeeded in driving her from home, and had afterwards hung upon her trail, and dogged her footsteps from place to place--had followed her up at every sewing-shop, milliner's establishment, and intelligence office at which she had ap- plied in order to obtaip honest employment --had surrounded her with all sorts of diffi- enlties, ard thrown in her way every tempta- tion that was calculated to lead a young and inexperienced girl astray-and I had heard them admit that every effort had proved futile, and that the girl, driven to despera- tion, had sought death rather than dishonor. All this I learned, but I was determined to learn more-I took an oath that I would not rest satisfied till I had gained the key to the mystery-the reason why she was thus per- "everingly followed--and 1 succeeded. How J succeeded, it is not necessary now to state, but it will appear in the course of my story. In the mean time I will commence i the history of Eveleen Wilson, beginning; at her birth, and continue it in a narrative i CHAPTER II. EVELEEN WILSON was born in the city t of Dublin, in -the year 1834. Her father, i Felix Wilson, was a merchant, and at the t time of the birth of my heroine, was well to N do in the world. He seemed to have been I born under an unlucky planet, however, for his wife died shortly after giving birth to a his first child, the subject of this story, and i from that period, troubles poured in upon i him thick and fast. By the time Eveleen 1 had reached her twelfth year, her father, b who loved her almost to idolatry, and had lavished upon her everything that money t eould bestow in the way of education, be- t came a bankrupt, anid sinking under the 1 weight of accumulated sorrows, he died, be- queathing his well-nigh distracted child to t the care of an only brother, ai respectable ^ farmer in the county of Kildare!   c The father of Mr. Wilson had been a  wealthy landed proprietor, but having fallen v under the suspicion of the British g6vern- e ment, during the Irish Rebellion of '98, a which cause he was known to favor, he t was obliged to fly the country shortly after n ehe apprehension of the lamented -Emmett,- aving his wife and two children-Felix, t   n the father of our heroine, and sRobert,: t o 1 uncle with whom she went to reside- fter e her father's death-behind him. He died in - exile, but his wife, who was a strong- d minded, well-educated woman, bestowed the 1 greatest care and attention upon her two n sons, of whom misfortune had made her the - only protector, and lived to see them grow D up to man's estate; respected and pro-sperous, when she also dieddeeply lamented by every , body who had the good fortune to know her. , Both Felix and Robert were strongly tine- i tured with the same feeling which led to t their father's downfall, and- their love for , Ireland was unsubdued, as their detestation of the British government. Having stated tthus much with regard to my heroine's parentage, I will pass over the days of her earlier childhood, during which nothing of importance occurred, and introduce her to the reader at the time of her sad bereave. ment--the first real trouble which she had ever known. "Come, Evy, my child," said her kind- hearted uncle, as the poor girl hung-over the corpse of her deceased parent, sobbing as though her heart would break, "don't take on so. I know it is hard-very hard, for one so young to be deprived of an only parent, but your immoderate grief will not bring him back to life, and you must try to: summon philosophy to your aid. 1 will be. a father to you-as tender a one as he was, if possible. I pledged myself to that effect to hint that lies stark and cold there, and -may heaven forget me if I forget my vow."' "Oh, uncle," exclaimed the weeping girl, "dear uncle, you are very kind, and Iam not ungrateful; but it is hard to think of his being laid in the cold, cold ground, all alone, while I, who have never known what it was to miss h s smile in the morning. not even while he lay sick there and racked with pain--am surrounded by the happy sunlight. I shall never listen to the sound of his voice again, which to me fwlas the sweetest music, nor feel the light pre sure of his hand-upon my head, as he would say, 'God bless you!' U1cle, uncle, I must weep, or my heart wil break!"  - "Poor child!" exclaimed her un le, more to himself than to her; "it is your r;rst great trouble, and heaven grant that it may be your last." I shall pass over -the sad events attending the funeral of the deceased gentleman, which was followed by hvery man, woman and child for miles around, who waS able to be presant, and come to a fine morning in June, when Robert Wilson, having attended to the settlement of his deceased brother's affairs, started with his niece, in -a comfortable traveling carriage, for his own residehce, a neat country farm-house in Kildare. As they slowly, traveled along the main southern road leading frbom 'Dublin toward K ,   L  teiniraad Munstdr, Eveleen's sad counit- P namee contrasted strargely with thee happy i fa eofthe passengers that filled the numer-  ous coaches moving towards tihe capital. They, perchace, were full of bright hopes 1 and happy anticipations, whfte she, poor I child, was about leaving tier native city with sh its happy associations, to dwell amid I scenes entirely new to her. Her uncle did i all he ceould to raise her crushed spirits, and 1 althoughiehe had some days before succeeded 4 in cifSlpig the violence of her grief, yet her ; features wore that woful expression of utter dejection painful tX behold, even in the face i of one Who had struggled with the world, but doubly painful when observed in the face of a child of twelve years. As the carriage passed by the spot where Emmett was hung, Eveleen's uncle pointed it out to her, and related to her the story of that patriot's downfall, telling her at the same time that her grandfather was forced to fly in consequence of having espoused-the cause of Ireland, and calling upon her ever to bear the fact in remembrance. "The spirit," said he, " that animated the patsots of '98 is not dead yet, and there may be, and doubtless will be, ere -long, another movement in behalf of Ireland. Remember, Evy, my child," said he, " that your father, and his father before him, were not only patriots, but good Catholics; and whatever you do, in your journey through life, never disgrace them by turning a Protestant." Eveleen had thus far in life been instructed in the Roman Catholic faith, but she was a singular child, and possessed a profoundness of thought, and argumentative powers far beyond what her years would warrant. She was a Catholic because she had been educated in that religion, but she possessed a liberality of sentiment that led her to suppose that it required something beyond a mere religious belief in any faith, to reach perfectability. She made no reply to her uncle's exhorta- tion, but cast her eyes upon the Dublin hills, lying to the left of their route, and sighed, as she thought it would be many, many days before-she might see them again. As they progressed on their journey, Eveleen so far forgot her sorrow as to become quite in- terested in her uncle's discourse, as he point- ed out one after another, the elegant resi- dences they passed on the road, relating, every once in a while, some, anecdote con- nected with. them, and by the time they reached Kilcullin, a little town on the'route, she had assumed almost an air of cheerful, ness. -              * } , "Look around you, Evy," said Roberi Wilson, as they passed a-splendid farm; " i not this a beautiful country -r-there is nol another upon which the blessed light of hea- yen shines,' that. is - more prolific., Nature has done all for it that she- could do, and- i kould be a paradire-it should be, but it it   pot, for withdraw ybur garze from the Abur fields that 'fairly groan with produce, aid- cast them yonder.  She looked ih the direction indicated, and beheld a group of persons, poorly clad, eager- ly huddling around a sort of shop. You do not know 'what draws that wretched crowd together?" he continued as she gazed inquiringly into his face, " 'l tell you-starvation! starvation in the sight of plenty!-that is a meal-shop, and they are receiving a'scanty allowance of what in. truth belongs to them, to keep themselves from perishing! This is true, my child-as true as I relat. t i Ng-ature has done every- thing to bless lland--the British govern- ment everythingo it/urse! it, remember that! I am well en6uih off, myself, thank God, as Iar as this wold./goods are concerned, but I would willingly become a beggar to-mor- rows if by. so;/lang I crush- the power that' is sapping the very life-blood of my country- men."  As he ceased speaking, the carriage drew, up at his residence--an old-fashioned, roomy country-house, and the next moment' Eve- r leen had alighted and entered. Robert Wilson's family consisted of him- , ielf, one son, and1his mother-in-law. He , lad been father to three daughters, but they, a s well as his wife, had died some years r previously. Although liberal to a fault, not r only to those in his immediate employmenrt but to the poor of his neighborhood genes- Ially; he was a thrifty man and could not beay , willful extravagance. It was this trait in his s character that led him to tegard his only rsoni Bernard, with disfavor. Bernard Wil-. 3son was a rather good-looking man, about I twenty-five years of age, but of a character T entirely opposite to that of his father. He [t was wild. reckless, profligate and prodigal, s not sthstanding that his father had used his  b^gendeavors to train him to habits of fru- - gality And industry. Added to this, he was , captious, quarrelsome, and disobedient, and 1, wus disliked by the surrounding peasantry, s as much as his father was beloved by them. y He was seldom at home, as he spent most r of his time in roaming around in the -prin- ,- cipal cities of Ireland, running his father in - debt, and indulging in- ol sorts of riotus i- living. He not unfrequently found his way F, even to London; but Cork' that city of gay i- women and frolicsome youigf men, suited y him best, and on more. than ,:pne ocwcaion 4 had, Mr. Wilson been called,'on to free 1 the dissipated youth from some agreeable  affair in which he had got involvedithat city. rt This conduct on the part of y(ng Wil. is son had led to many unpleasant scenes be- at tween himself and his father, who at length i- threatened' to disinherit him if heod not re mend his ways. This, however, Beard it regarded merely as the result of pi is and paid not the slightest attention /o'i/.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7813-00000006"/> Upon-the day on which Eveleen arrived at her Uncle's mansion, a letter had been received from Bernard, stating that he was entirely out of money, and asking his-father for a remittance of fifty pounds. This ex- asperated the old gentleman beyond endu- rance, and he at once sat down to answer it. He wrote the young 'man to thie effect that not one cent more should he receive of his money-that he was disgusted with his un- dutiful conduct-that his- uncle -had died, leaving his ohly daughter in his charge, and that if he did not at once return to his home, and pursue an entirely different course from that which he had for some time past fol- lowed, he would disinherit him, and leave the bulk of his property to his (Bernard's) cousin. Eveleen had not been in her new home a week before she was not only the favorite of her uncle's household but the idol of every- body with whom she had come in contact. Her amiable gentleness and unaffected sim- plicity, added to her dejected look of patient suffering, and the fact that she was an or- phan, had at once taken hold of the sym- pathies of the warm-hearted peasantry. and there was not- a. colleen in the place that would not have walked through fire to serve her, nor a youth of the male gender that would not have cracked the crown of any " onmannerly haythen" that should even so much as look cross-wise at her. The old folks prayed for her, and the young ones swore by her, and everything which tended in the slightest degree to make her forget her forlorn condition, was done. One morning about a week subsequent to the .dispatch of Mr.,Wilson's letter to his son, Eveleen, who was an early riser, was traversing a small lane which led frorm her uncle's estate to a cluster of small cottages a short distance off, when reaching an abrupt turn she suddenly came upon an old woman pulling weeds and nettles from berfeath a hedge. The young girl's light footfall at- tracted the attention of the poor old crea- * ture, and looking up -from her occupation, their eyes met, and a-singular expression settled upon her face. "God be betune us an' harm," she ex- elauhed, crossing herself, " but has .the cowld grave gev up its dead!" For a moment the strange appearance of the distressed object before her somewhat startled the young girl. She was appa- rently about eighty years of age, and was bent nearly double. Her shriveled-up skin was the color of parchment-her small Wlack eves were peculiarly wild and -sharp, and a few grey locks struggled from beneath her dingy cap. Eveleen, however, soon re- gained her composure, and mildly addressing the old woman, she asked- "Do I so much resemble, some' departed friend of vours. then, go-M mother ." A   "Your 'name is Eveleen Wilso'n, re- marked the bl1d woman, without for a mo- ment removing her gaze from the face of the child. "You have guessed rightly," answered Eveleen,  . "Sorra a guess Ii ed at all," was the rev ply, 1" for I know it-I'm an old woman, an they call me a nathral, but I know what I know. Your mother--God rest her sowl-- was as gentle and purty a craythur as iveT whispered a prayer to the howly vargin, ane you're as much like her as she was like her- self." "You knew my mother, then "   said Eveleen. "Knew her!" answered the old woman, "didn't I know her, and her mother before her! I hard you wor comin here, and was prepared to see, something like her, bud whin you kem upon me so suddint, I felt a threm- blin at my heart, for I thought it was her- silf that stud before me. Eveieen Wilson," she continued, " your mother died young, but she was a good Christian, an' she's in heaven, where yersilf would be betther off than vou are here, 'for there's thrials, 'and thribulashuns, and throuble in store for you, It's not well fitted to sthruggle wid the world ye are, for ye are too gentle and angel-like in your nature-but more power to ye, and may the mother of God watch over and bear ye safely through!" At this moment the noise of a horse's hoofs was heard, and simultaneously Jook- ing up, they beheld a horseman approach? ing. "Ye'll have many throubles, Eveleen," continued the old woman, " but the greatest iv them all is approachin' now, so avoid him alana. The desaved colleen's death lies at his door, the beraved father's dying curse is 6n his sowl, and his own father's maledic- tion will soon be upon his head. Avoid him, alana, for there's danger in him." Asshe ceased speakingj the individual mentioned passed scowlingly by in the di- rection of Mr. Wilson's residence, and was soon hidden from view. "Good mornin' darlint," said the old wo- man, when the traveler was .fairly out of sight. " don't be forgettin' what I tould ye, Come an' see me whin ye've an opportu. 'nity. I live in a cabin beyant, (pointing in 'the direction of a clump of trees), an' iv ye can't find it yersilf, sure iverybody knows euld Biddy Ryan, and any one 'll show ye the way," so saying she hobbled off before Eveleen had an opportunity to make any- inquiries regarding the stranger agains whom she had been cautioned. The young girl slowly and thoughtfully, retraced her r steps, pondering upon the words of the strange being who had just left her, and I wondering what she could possibly have to I fear from .a person totally unknown to her/ /y  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7813-00000007"/> bn. shte apprtoahed her uncle's house, she p'reilved the travellers .horse quietly itanadng in front of the entrancegate. A sudden tremor, she knew not why, shook her frame', as he entered the spacious hall lead- ing to the principal sitting-room of the maa- sion. "Not one penny!" she heard her uncle exclaim, angrily, as she paused to compose herself, before proceeding-*' not one penny --you have squandered my means-brought disgrace on me and yourself, by your wild, wayward, and unprincipled conduct. and dis- obeyed me idf every way. With a father's foolish fondness for an only son, I have borne with it till patience has ceased to be -virtue. You have persisted in your de- relict coutrse, notwithstanding all my exhor- tations and threatenings, till you have suc- ceeded entirely in alienating every vestige of affection which! I ever had for you, and now go-leave this house, and never enter it again till you can do so an altered man, for -at present you are no fit person to reside  nder the same roof with virtue and inno- cence!"    \ The next moment the door was violently thrown open, and the traveller whom she had seen upon the road rushed forth. Eve- leen was terrified at the fiend-like expres- sion of his countenance, as he for a moment glared upon her like a wild beast, and then pushed her violently aside. Every bad passion which the human breast has ever felt, seemed to be concentrated in the fixed gaze with which he for a moment regarded her and, tottering into the room half-dead with fright, she fell into Mr. Wilson's arms, ex- claiming-- '"Uncle, who is that dreadful man, and what have I done to awaken his wrath?" " I am sorry to say, Eveleen, my child," he answered, " that he is my son-my only son-and your cousin. He has provoked me beyond endurance, and I have forbidden him the house till he can enter it with some show of reformation." "I hope that my appearance here has not led in any way to this difficulty," said Eve- leen, the te-ars springing to her eyes at the bare mention of such a thing; 4I would sooner beg, starve, anythingrather than that, dear uncle!" "Make yourself easy, my- dear child," answered her uncle; " this is not the first time that a similar scene has taken place in this room; but, by'all that is sacred, it shall be the last." So saying, he kissed her cheek, and bidding her to give no heed to what had happened, he started out to overlook the work of the laborers. Bernard Wilson, in, the meantime, had dashed rftklessly. into the saddle, and plunging the. spurs rowel deep into his horse, soarted Qa the road to Dubliqon a full   I must now conduct the reader to a dingy back room in one of the numerous dirty liquor-shops to be found upon, the Dublit quays leading to the Four Courts, in whict were assembled two of the most villainous, hand-dog looking .countenances that ever rested upon the Shoulders of as many human bipeds. They had the appearance of sea- faring men, and their forms were scarcely visibfe through the cloud of smoke by which they were surrounded. "Did you say he would be here to-night, Pat?" inquired one of -the party, a surly, broad-shouldered, bull-necked American. t"I said he tould me heo*ud, Bill," an- swered the party addressee", an' be the Hill o' Howth, I nivir knew him to niglict an appointment whin there was any deiil- thry to be performed." "And how- do you know there is to be any diviltry performed, now?" asked he who had been addressed as -Bill. *' Well, that I mayn't sin," laughed Pat, "but there's a Question! what else wud he want wid us! Sure he niver employed us to pray for him! I hope it's something asier than usual he has for us, anyways; for although he don't mind paying liberally, it's not a pleasant business to ie abductin' girls, firin' estates, and a:ch like dilikate matthers."  As the Irishman ceased speaking, the door opened, and Bernard Wilson stood bae fore them. "Boys," said he, "I am glad to find you on haild, for I'v got a little business for you that must be attended to immediately." "What is it this time?" inquired Pat, as he finished a mug of beer that stood before him., Something entirely out of my line," an- swered Bernard---"I want you to rob a house." "Is that all?" said Pat, with a laugh- "6 upon me sowl an' conshence, Master Wil- son, but. it's progressin' famously, ye are!- sure that's a legitimate business!" "Silence! you unminnerly hound!" ex- claimed the young man irefully---" do you suppose H have turned a common house- breaker  If you do, you are vastly mis. taken-I only wish to take what of right belongs to me-the house I intend to rob in my father's!" "Good enough!" exclaimed both the men in a breath, " we are with you!" "Then be about it, quick!" said Bernard, "6 for there is no time to lose: and hark ye, Bill Stark, and you, Pat Flanders--if in passing through any of the rooms, you see a pale-faced young devil in female form, ly- ing asleep, it .will be worth somethiig to you if she never wakes again-!"  "is it the: nace that your father tuk wid him from Dublin t" inquired Pat. - "The same," answeled Bemrnar.  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7813-00000008"/> - , Then, be me sowl," answered Pat, " i niver should have knode who to strangle, frim your description-for to my eyes she looked more lik6 an angel nor a devil, whin I saw her n 'the carriage; but it's all one to me, for divil a much difference I can see be- tween diviils an' angels, anyways." three nights following the conversation just detailed, Robert Wilson's residence was robbed of property and money to a large amount, . and Eveleen Wilson had disap- peared. CHAPTER III. I WOUND up the last chapter by statingK that three nights after the conversation be- tween Bernard Wilson, Pat Flanders and Bill -Stark, the Wilson mansion was robbed, and Eveleen spirited away. I shall now proceed to give some of the circumstances attending the robbery. About 12 o'clock on the night preceding the outrageous affair, the three worthies I have just mentioned, night have been seen emerging from the  turn of the lane leading towards the far- mer's abode, wher- it will be remembered the meeting took place between Eveleen and Biddy Ryan. They were all dressed' in smock frocks and slouched hats, and Ber- nard Wilson in addition wore an immense false pair of bushy whiskers, and a patch over his left eye, rendering his disguise so perfect that his own father would not have known lim had he suddenly met him. "Softly, softly-!" whispered Bernard, as they paused a short distance fromthe house, under the shadow of an old oak tree that threw its long arms far out into the road. ' Now Pat," he continued, " you know ex- actly how the place is situated, and I want you to creep noiselessly up and reconnoitre. Make a perfect circuit of the farm, and find out if there is a light in any of the win- dows, or anybody'stirring on the premises. And here," said he, presenting a wide-neck- ed tin can, tightly corked, " take this with you, and if the. dog should trouble you, open it and give him a piece of the meat you will find in it, but take care that your own nostrils are not affected by the stuff into which it has been dipped. Be careful of the eair, for we may have further use for its con- ents. Now go, and be 'cautious." Thus advised, PIat; pulling his hat over his eyes, crouched Idown, and creeping along in the shadow of the hedge, like a snake in the grass, was soon out of sight. It was a lovely night, especially for that latitude, where the sky is ever more likely to be cloudy than clear. The bright stars twinkled in the -blue firmament, as if .trem- bling at the enormity of the crime about to be committed, and the pale, chaste moon   looked down as if norriOtving over the wicked ness of the human heart. The scene was so calm,: and clear, and holy, that it .ould almost seem as though the men who cowered beneath that tree, plotting robbery and mur- der, would have mistaken the light rustling of the leaves above them for the whisper- ing of angels pleading with them to forego their hellish purpose, and that they would have abandoned their designs to some more fitting night, when the storm fiend should be abroad, and devils seem to,shriek in the air. But no; Bernard Wilson was not alivy to the influence of such a scene. His thoughts- were turned inward. The "still, small voice" was dead in his heart, and sin, Jark, dreadful and damning, reigned there. He had given full sway to his baser passions, and he now dwelt upon the robbery of a kind father, and the murder of an innocent girl-one, moreover, bound to him by the ties of consanguinity-whom he should havt been willing to lose his life in defence of instead of seeking to destroy-without  pang of remorse. * In about half-an-hour, Pat rejoined hit comrades in iniquity, and imparted the in- formation that everything was right. "Are you sure," inquiringly whispered Bernard, "that the lights are all out?" "Every wan," was the response; "devil as much as the ray of a dead shape's eye to be seen," "And you found nolody stiing about the farm?" t"Devil a wan, but wan-an'. it's me own opinion that he'll niver stir agin," and as he said this, he exposed the blade of a long knife which he held in his hand to a solitary ray of the moon thattshot through an open- ing in the branches above him, when Ber- nard and Bill Stark started back in horror, and shuddered at the sight of fresh blood. ," Why, Pat," said Bill Stark, scarcely able to speak for the fear that filled him, "you wasn't obliged to take life!" "t Well, you see," said the ruffian, with a chuckle, as he wiped the blade with some dry leaves, "I wasn't exactly obliged to, but I thought it safer, and as 1 iad no in- structions agin it, I did it. Afther all, I don't know as he'll be any great loss, for he was gettin' purty old and it's time he was dead; and I don't believe masther Bernard here had any great affection for him any, way, or he would have cautioned me agin killin' him afther giviny me liberty to kill the colleen. Besides," he continued, "I had a grudge agin him, for he never liked me, End has driven me off the ground : twice."  The hair rose upon the head of Bernard Wilson; his respiration grew ifficult) and cold drops of sweat started upon his brow , and chase each- other -down hi-livid' face, i as the suTlicion flashed across his mtindth-a   tte wretch before him had murdered his g father, for bad as he was, such a crime had or never entered his mind.   o- "' Fiend!" he ejaculated in a smothered u whisper, as he clutched Pat by the throat o and bore him to the ground; "who is it r you have killed? If you have dared to tl raise your band against my father's life, you fi shall never leave this spot in possession b of your own. Say, whom have you mur- e dered ."                c "Take your fingers from my throat," t said Pat, who could scarcely articulate from 1 the pressure on his windpipe, "and I will a tell you."              f "Speak, then,i' said Bernard, as he re- ^ laxed his grasp, " and quickly."   t "Well, thin," answered Pat, slowly, t ' sure it was only the dog I shrew. I gev I him the mate first, as you tould me, and' afther he was ashape, shnug an' comfort- f able, I thought I'd dhraw a little blood from 1 him to rendher him fable, the. way he i wouldn't have strength to bark whin be'd ( wake up agin, an? I cut his throat beautiful i frim ear to ear."  "Pshaw!" said Bernard, contemptuously, 4 as he spurned the prostrate Pat with his foot-" will you never have done with this pleasantry 2 We are here on business to- night-not pleasure--and you would oblige me, if you would attend to it properly. Now follow me, and be-careful," he conti- nued, and the trio proceeded towards the exrecutionp of their unholy design. The inmates of the farm-house, not dream- ing of harm, had retired early, and at the time the damnable plot was hatching be- neath the tree outside, they were enjoying that deep and tranquil slumber which can flow from the consciousness of innocence and rectitude. Eveleen and ;er uncle had taken a long ride in the afternoon around the country adjoining the farmer's estate, in the'course of which Mr. Wilson had stop- ped to exchange greetings with many of his especial favorites among the poor people of the ,lace, one of whom was Biddy Ryan, at whose cabin they alighted and spent some time in conversation.- The Young girl, on retiring to rest, was consequently consi- derably fatigued, but notwithstanding this fact, she was restless and ill at ease. She had never before experienced such feelings beneath her .uncle's roof, but in spite of her- self a sense of impending danger took -pos- session of her, she knew not why, and pre- vious to retiring to'rest, she knelt before a crucifix which adorred the mantle-piece in her littie apartmenti and prayed fervently and long, that the danger-if any there was -which hung over her, might be averted, or if it must come, that she might have strength to bear it,-and if it-was to end in iesth, she prayed that her sins pight, all be frgiven her. Think of thi ye :orldly,   gay, and heartless ones, that jostle each other on life's highway, without a thought of the awful responsibility that rests upon upon you! Look at this picture, thou votar} of pleasure, whose life is one continued round of thoughtless gayety--look at it, thou cormorant Crcesus--thou stony-hearted fiend, who dost daily grow richer on the blood, and sweat, and groans-of thy impov. erished fellow-man-look at it thou painted courtesan, who dost, bold and reckless, tauntingly tread the .crowded pave. Oh, lookl-at the picture of Eveleen-at prayer, acknowledging her errors and supplicating for mercy, she who has really never known what it was to sin; look at it, I say, and then reflect-if souls like hers need absolu. tion, how must stand your account witi heaven                 . ' The poor child having finished- her ori- sons, threw herself upon the bed, and for a long time lay turning over in her mind the , various scenes which she had witnessed Iduring the day, and trying to discover in the conversations which she had listeed to, somethi-ng which" might account for the un- , easiness which she experienced; but apart 3 from the interview between-herself and old s Biddy in the lane, some days previously,she - could think of nothing that was worthy a B momenti' consideration. The face of her  violent cousin, as he dashed by her in. the - hall, on the day of his quarrel with her uncle, e did indeed seem to haunt her, but she could not understand why hie should wish to in- - jure her, and she tried to disconnect him e entirely with the evil presentiment which - weighed her down. The room she occu- g pied was at the rear of the house and on the n ground floor, the foot of the bed upon which e she was reclining, pointed towards the win- d dow, and as she lay gazing between the d filds of the sloping curtains, at one or two n bright stars which showed themselves, ,- vainly endeavoring to argue herself to i sleep, she was startled by observing the le curtains move. Her fear was only mo- n, mentary, however, for with the true courage It characteristic of-a guileless heart, she attri- I, buted what she had witnessed to the action i- of the wind, and was about turufing upon her is side to woo sleep again, -when she thought ie she saw distinctly. a man's face, which sud- gs denly appeared at the window and was as r- suddenly withdrawn. For-a moment she s- had Well-nigh screamed out with terror, but e- restraining her, fear, 'she waited to see if it a would appear again, in which case she had in made up her mind'to leap from her bed, ly rush Ito her uncle's room, and give thealarm. as Five, tens, fifteen minutes passed by, and d, nothing occurred to renew her fears. So, re gathering courage astshe reflected upon the in love which/ the. surrounding peasantry bore be to he6r uncle, and the absurdity of thee ' idq y, thati anbody should wish tod harm 'him. a  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7813-00000009"/> at length arose from 'her bed, approached the window, and gazed out upon the night. Everythivg was quiet. Not a sound dis- turbed the stillness, except the hum of in- sect life, and the mournfill moaning of the wind through the branches of the trees. "How foolish I am," she at length said to herself, as, satisfied with her scrutiny, she approached her bed again, -" surely I ought to know that God never forsakes those who 'try to do right," and laying herself -down again, she was soon in an uneasy slumber. She had scarcely closed her eyes when the face of Pat Flanders appeared at the window. "Ah, me darlint," he muttered to himself, as he carefully pushed the curtain aside, and proceeded to enter the apartment; " is it there ye are? By me sowl, I believe I'll be the first in the house, and bad luck to me, I ought t0 be the last, for I've the manest job in hand I iver undertook in my life. I wudn't mind so much throttlin' a stout gos- soon, or knockin' out the brains iv a grown man, but may the divil fly away wid me if I like the idea iv sphilin' the countenance iv a colleen." By' this time he had reache d the bedside of the sleeping girl, and taking a sponge from the tin can, which he had not yet re- linquished,-he held it to her nostrils for a I moment, and then continued- - 'And such a colleen!  Divil resave the I ao' nme can, harum her! I do believe the divil himself-as hard an ould customer as  the prastes do be makin' him out-would rather suffer than to see her hurted!" i I am nolt a believer in total depravity. I have seen the -human character in pretty much all its phases, and I have never yet i met with man, woman, or child, that had not some redeeming quality, which it required \only circumstances to develop. I have e known the most reckless and hardened of i wretches--men who have spent a life time a amid scenes of a most revolting nature- 1 who were happy only when outraging the laws or injuring their fellows--I have known a such men to weep when, in the course of a I Judge's remarks previous to sentence, some a incident connected with thqir childish, inno- I ent days, recurred to their memory. I have v een the most abandoned of women shed r tears at the recollection of a mother's ex- y hortation uttered many years before, show- ing that although a long course of crime and a profligacy had tended to blunt their sensibi- c lities and render them loathsome and dis- f lusting to virtuous milkds, still some rem- nant of the, angel remained. The wretch I that now stood at Eveleen's bed side, seldom g felt the slightest touch of pity. He had f( never before hesitated to commit any act, however outrageous, for which his unprin- w cipled  employer was willing to pay him; tt lbt as he stood gazing upon the fair face of,   d8 the child that lay powerless be ore him, he* I. features assumed the expression of one tiat s- he had known many, many years before,when i- he was a guileless, innocent boy-one With e whom he had romped and frolicked upon the a. green sward ;- whose childish woes he had to tried to soothe, and in whose mirth he had e participated--that one was his sister-and it though she had been long dead, and the face o of Eveleen was not in reality anything like n hers, yet he thought of her, and he could not help imagining that she lay before him, n as he had seen her in her shroud on the e morning when she had been taken from his view and put beneath the ground. He had f, not indulged in thoughts such as these for e, many long years before, and as retrospec- s tion recalled vividly to his imagination the "scenes of his childhood, that merciless, har- !, dened, brutal wretch was for a moment a boy t again, and forgot what spot be stood upon, I and why he stood there. He was brought - to his senses by a hot tear dropping upon n his hand, and, starting as though it had been f a red hot coal, he exclaimed- e "Pat, Pat, ye divil! what is it ye're about at all?--is it blubberin' ye are, ye blegard? e -arrah, musha, big bad luck to the imp that eput Norah in me head at all." Then pick- - ing Eveleen up as though she had been an . a infant, he continued-"Well, well, for once in yer life, Misthur Bernard Wilson, yere e given Patt Flandhers a job to do, that he, e wouldn't transact for the full iv a house iv s goold. Iv ye're anxios for the gl's death, I ye must kill her yerself, for divil a wan o' mne 'll do it." As he finished speaking. the head of Bill Stark appeared at the window, and that tworthy exclaimed, in a low key-- t' "Pat, what the devil are you about . Do I you intend to stay in that room till you're  caught? Wilson has got everything that ' is comatable,}6ng ago, and I left him under a tree, swearing like a trooper at your de- lay--so hurry!" Thus admonished, Patt again rubbed the spongeunder the nose of Eveleen, and thern passing her out to Bill, he followed himself, and noiselessly, and with rapid strides, they made their way to where their leader was waiting, but what was -their surprise on ar- Iriving at the tree to find that he had de. parted. "Fhat in the divil's name does this mane, at all?" said Pat, who began to feel suspi- cious that Bernard meant to play them foul. "I don't know what it means," replied Bill Stark, " but by-- , if he attempts to get the best-of us, I'll blow on him if I dien for it ."' Just at this, moment- they heard a shrill whistle, proceeding from a distance down the lane. - "Thats   him," said Pat, "I know hit. a   1nilm;-" and at one they started in, the  directisi of the. sound.     .  They'wem not long in catohing up withb I Bernard, whom they found waiting impar- 1 tiently for their arrival, and whose rage on ,X seeing the fibrm of Eveleen in the arms of I Pat, knew no bounds. "' What in. hell," he exclaimed, " did you N want to log that young beast here for!--to I betray us!-couldn't you strangle her as she : lay in bed '"              1 "( May the divil sthrangle me. iv I cud," I answered Pat, "an' that's the raison H.1 brought' her along-there she is for you,  now, and iv you want hbr sthrangled, sthran- gle her yersilf," By this time the effects of the narcotic had passed off, and Eveleen began to return to consciousness. Slowly raising her heads from the position in which it had lain on Pat's shoulder, she opened her eyes, and rubbing them as. if in a dream, she at length became aware that she was in the arms of a man, and shrieking "Help!" with all the strength of which she was' capable, she struggled to free herself, "Hell and the devil!" muttered Bernard, otween his set teeti, " she has revived and all is lost, unless we silence her! Dash her brains out against a tree!" he exclaimed, addresoing Pat, " if she utters another whim. per." "Indade 'll not," saidPat, as Eveleen, having torn herself from his embrace, made the welkin ring with, shriek after shriek, as she fled from her enemies. "Then I wilt dosit myself," cried Ber-. lard, as he pursued, the. unfortunate girl, who fled with, the swiftness of a frightened hare, till overcome at length with terror and exhaustion, she fell at, full length uponw the ground, and her fiendish cousin raised her up with -the intent of, putting his inhuman threat into execution. Hardly had he got her fairly in his grasp, however, when a blow from a blackthorn stick caused him to measure his length upon the ground, and the next moment a pair of strong arms raised her,.and the owner of said arms fled preci- pitately with her in. the direction of Biddy R  Ian's cottage, as he heard the approaching 'ototeps of Berard's cqmpanions. "Are you hurted ." inquired:, Pat, as' he raised Bernard Wilson. from:the ground. - "Damnation!" answered Bernard, as he leant upon his two comrade- for support; "to be knocked down like a, dog, without an opportunity of returning the blow! Oi ff money can purchase the knowledge of whom I am indebted to for this, I will beg. lar: myself, if necessary, to obtain it, that-  may be revenged." "Well, thin," said Pat, "he's a quick lad, whoever he is; for divil a, dger wid the iounds in pnrehute, ever made the tracks he 4i down. the. lae   ' l:   "Damn him!" excaimed Bena^ad, bittr y.- " 'll1 be even with him some dayij :- hope.

"You're growing d&amp;d- humane all of a sudden," remarked Bernard, contemptuously, and Pat- was about to reply, when, he wa interrupted by Stark, who exclaimed,-  "This, is a very pretty quarrel as it stands," as, thie. man- in the play says, "' butl while you are bickering hereithe friend'whg treated you to that crack ,on the sconce ib making the best of his way to. some place of safety, and before we know it, we, shall have fifty wild.

"'That's very true," said; Bernard,. who at. once. saw the force-of Spark's remark, and trembled, with feaT at the thought of be- ing apprehended--" here, bind this handker- ohief round my head, one of you, and let-  to our horses at once. If I can hold out-till we, reach Doyle's, I shall be'fortunate, for I begin: to feel weak already from the lovs ot -blood," and having taken a swallow. of whii. ky from. a fiat. bottle which Pat carriedi about. him, to give him strength; Bernard lent upon the shoulders of the two men, and the party sought their horses, which were tethered in an obscure. spot'a short distaace r off, and were soon upon their way to Bally- I hale.

"Lave the colleen upon my bed," said the old woman, as she proceeded to comply with his request. The young man laid Eveleen gently down upon the rough couch which Biddy had va- cated, and impatiently waited till the old woman, whose movements, notwithstanding - she made all the haste which her. old bones were capable, were none of the fastest, had procured a light. t"Here it is, honey," she exclaimed, as she approached the form of the insensible girl with the light, here it is, afid let us see who is the colleen. Howly mother of God!" she exclaimed, as the candle's dim rays fell upon the pallid features of Eveleen--" it is the farmer's nace, 'tis Eveleen Wilson! Oh, whirra! whirra! who has done this at alll"            / "I don't know who done it," answered the youth, " but I do know that he has a head- ache at this present moment, from another cause than drinking whisky, or his skull is an unusually thick one." If old Biddy moved slowly when she first got out of bed, she made up for it, now by the alacrity with which she flew about, and from her long experience and familiarity in cases of sickness or accident, she soon suc- ceeded in restoring the color to the cheeks and lips of the unconscious girl. While she was thus humanely engaged, the youth. re- lated to her all the circumstances attending the case, of which he had any knowledge, and by the time Eveleen had so far recov- ered as to open her eyes and gaze confused- ly around her, he had finished the recital and stood gazing upon the mild face of the girl with an undisguised look of the deepest ad. miration. And here, I may as well, as the youth will figure somewhat largely in the subsequent chapters of my story, give a short description of him. William Haviland was a young man, about twenty-two years of age ; but to judge from his appearance, he was much younger. He was a Corkonian by birth, as were his father and mother before him, and the inde- pendent characteristics of that mixed race were strongly predominant in his composi- tion.  The maritime position of Cork, and the incursions of the Danes, together with the settlement there of the English down to the days&amp; of Cromwell, naturally tended to modify the Celtic race; but of all other marks in the! mixture, that of the French Huguenots was most visible, and it was from this latter stock that the preserver of Eve- leen claimed his descent. Unlike Eveleen, C he had been educated in the Episcopal reli- p glon, but like her, he attached no particular importance to sect or creed,-in fact, he had a become  so thoroughly disgusted with the i   s petty bickerings and heart burnings existing Iamong all denominations, -that he had with- drawn himself entirely from everything like a Church, and had determined to work out his own salvation without advice or assist- ance from the pulpit, simply building his faith upon the Rock' of Ages, and trusting - to the merits of the Redeemer of the world. He had inherited from his father a love fot the intellectual, a strong desire for know- ledge, and independence of thought, which I induced him to act upon the principle adop- ted by Lessing, as if instinctively, that it is better to think for yourself, even though you think wrong, than to allow another to think for you. He possessed, moreover, an ardent attachment for his country, and the wrongs of Ireland moved him deeply-a longing de sire to see her freed from the thraldom ot oppression was, indeed, the wish nearest his heart, and he hated and despised every senti- ment, come it from whatever quarter, that tended in the slightest degree to prevent that " consummation so devoutly to  be wished." It was this feeling that led him to energetically and eloquently promulgate principles that were afterwards adopted by a party numbering among its members persons of every creed and belief, and known as "Young lreland"--a party, that but for the despicable feeling of bitter sectarianism, disgraceful alike to the Christian and the patriot{ would, ere this, have removed the tyrannical claws of the lion from the "Green Isle," and Ireland would again have had "a ,place among the nations of the earth." Havi- land was, iin heart and soul a patriot, and he carried the evidence of that fact in his coun- tenance, which bore the unmistakable evi- dences of his Huguenotic origin. Hiseyes were large, black and lustrous, his com- plexion and hair- dark, and his whole face expressive of determination and firmness. He was not by any means a perfect charac- ter, however, for although his morals were unexceptionable, and he could love an object upon which his affections might chance to alight with an intensity of devotion amounting almost to idolatry, yet he could hate as conr diallv, and his antipathy once excited, he was bitter, vindictive, and even cruel. There was no medium in his character; with him, j it was either love or hate, as far as his friends and. enemies were concerned, but in his intercourse with the world at large, he was courteous, affable and engaging. As I have already Alid, he looked much younger than his years would warrant; there was not a sign of beard yet upon his face, which was quite soft, though glowing with the hue of health and vigor, and his strong-knit, compact, and sinewy frame, gave token of great strength and agility.  "Have I  been dreaming '" said Eveleea, abstractedly, as she slowly revived and gaw d first at Biddy and then at her preserver. O, m /   bsthis reality "As she said ,this, she *tretched forth her arm and grasped the hand Cthe old woman firmly, as if to assure her- self that it was realflesh and blood. "Thank Heaven!" she exclaimed, "I am safe! I remember now having struggled with a bad man, who sought to do me harm; who he was, or why he wished to injure me, or how lie succeeded in taking me from my bed, I cannot -tell, nor do I know how I escaped his wrath and found a refuge here." "' Whist, darlint, don't disthress yourself; keep aisy awhile, an' ye'll learn all about it, betimes," said"Biddy, as she stooped to kiss the fair brow of the maiden. "Oh, it's misilf that knew somethin' would go wrong, the blissed ininit I laid me two eyes on black Pat Flanders yesther-night, skulkin' in the shebeen shop bey-ant the bridge!" !"Do you think he had any hand in the transaction, mother "I asked young Hav- iland. "God forgive me, iv I judge him wrong- fully," she answered, " bud I think he had a hand in"it." "Then I'll pound him to a jelly for the mere suspicion," replied Haviland, " the first time I meet him. "I can't go wrong ida beating him soundly even if he knows nothing of this business, for I know him to L; a sneaking thieving, hang-dog scoundrel, and one that should have been hung long since, without-the benefit of clergy." "That's thrue for you, masther Haviland," exclaimed Biddy, "that's thrue for you- sure there's no wan knows that same betther nor mesilf. Didn't the black-hearted ruffin thry to shwear away -the character iv Catherine McBride--who's dead now/God rest her s6wl!-afther her misfortune, whin 'the Father above us knows-and so did he, tile vilyan!-that she was as pure as the snow till she made the acquaintance of that base hound, Bernard Wilson--that I should be obliged, in truth, to call the nathral born son of the best man livin',. such a name!" At the mention of her cousin's name, a painful expression settled upon the face of Eveleen, for though she tried hard to do so, she could not avoid the conviction that it Was he who had attempted her life. She would not, however, have made her thoughts known for the world-she felt it would break her uncle's heart if he even suspected that his son could be guilty of so black a crime as murder, so after reflecting a moment,-she said, addressing Haviland: ^ Do not, I beseech you, sir, injure any- ,body on a mere suspicion of their having done me wrong; I should not rest easy if I thought you would. I would not harm the parties, even if I knew them, for ' Vengeance is Mine, saith the Lord,' and crime will certainly bring with it its own punishment. --You must promise me, sir, indeed you '     ! -  2   e must, that you will not hurt the person whom d you suspect," and as she said this, she bent per gaze beseechingly upon him. k  "Well, then, I won't," he answered, I "since you desire it. I gave the fellow' 1 from whom I rescued you a remembrancer, e and I suppose I must rest satisfied with that v till I can get some positive proof as to who I the despicable wretches were." d  "It was you, then,' who brought me hither," said Eveleen, inquiringly, and in a ; gratified tone. ;, "Yes," he replied, " fortune .was kind o enough to bestow upon me the favor of run- 3 ning a slight risk in your behalf, for which I , am very thankful to her. I was going to- k wards home from the house of a sick friend e with whom I had been sitting iup, when I was attracted by your cries and arrived-just e in time to stretch the villain with whom you - was struggling, upon the earth. I should most certainly have had 'a closer acquaint- - ance with him, had- it not been that I heard a the footsteps of his companions approaching, and fearful that your safety might be imper- a illed if I remained longer, I fled as fast as e possible, and succeeded in reaching here in g safety."   "You would not know, the person by whom   I; was assailed, then, should you , see him, again!" said Eveleen, with some , anxiety. "Not I," answered Haviland; "I wish 1 ' could; it was so dark that it would have - been impossible to tell whether he was black * or white." A  look of satisfaction rested upon the features of Eveleen,as she replied: ! "Well, sir, I thank you for the great service which you have rendered me, and I , am sure my uncle will thank you too. It was very fortunate that- it was no worse, and I hope our acquaintance will not end here." "If it does," was the reply. of Haviland, "itshall not be my fault, I promise you; and now, as there is no further danger to be apprehended, I shall take my leave, trusting that by. the time we meet again, you will. have entirely recovered from the shock which you have received. Good morning!" i Good morning, sir," answered Eveleen, pleasantly. *' God be with you!" said old Biddy,as the young man sallied forth, and took -his -way- homeward, whistling a favorite air. "Iwonder," said William Haviland to him- self, as he ceased whistling and his nind reverted to the scenes through which he had just passed-- I wonder who it could have been that wished to harm a young creature like that! Old Biddy suspects Pat Flan. ders; but if -he engaged in it, he is only ad instrument in the hands of somebody else, and works for pay-who is that somebody else, that's the question . The old woman  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7813-00000011"/> in mentioning his name, coupled it with that af BernardV ilson-he's a hard man, I know, t)ut I hardly think he'd stoop to the murder of a child, and that child his father's niece- I am sure, he would not, unless he had some powerful reasonrfor it, and I see no reason unless lie fears his father may grow too fond of her, and take it into his head to leave her 'a portion of his property.' That's it, I'll be sworn! Bernard Wilson is a selfish, heart- less man, and reckless,-withal, and if he is not at the bottom of the matter, who is? what possible enemy can Eveleein Wilson have, when everybody that sees her must love her, and she has only been here a few days 1 "After all," he continued, when he had turried the matter over in his mind at least twenty times, "may not that villain, Pat, have attempted to steal her away in the hope of obtaining a ransom "for her in some indirect manner? I know he is up to every imaginable rascality, and he barely escaped conviction On a similar charge be- iore. 'If I can come across him I'll choke the truth out of him! How beautiful she looked as she lay there insensible! ,Who could find it in his. heart to harm her? I wonder if she felt any df the sensations that I experienced as we looked at each other? Nonsense what am Ithinking of?-she is a child-a mere child.-and cannot be sup- posed to ever have thought seriously upon any subject! Besides, if it were otherwise that is, not-the direction in which I should look. Her uncle is an honest, Upright, good man, but full of religious prejudices, and al- though he likes me well enough as an ac- quaintance, he would never consent to his niece's union with any other than a thorough- going Roman Catholic, and I am too fond of thinking for myself ever to yield up either my spiritual or physical being to the control of any man. But, 1 declare, in what a train of reflections have I been indulging, and the subject of them a little girl!" Those expressions of William Haviland with regard to the'juvenility of Eveleen Wilson were all well enough as far as they went, but they did not come from his heart, for he could not avoid the conviction that notwithstanding her extreme vouth, she was very different from females of her age gene- rally. Although not by any means a wo-  man, still she was not a child, for she took no pleasure in childish sports, and she pos- sessed a gravity of demeanor and profound- ness of thought that might sometimes be looked for in vain in females of twice hei age. Added to this, her appearance was greatly in favor of a more advanced period in life, for she had attained nearly her full height, and her tondness for study had given a thoughtful cast to her countenance, which  might easily be mistaken - foir experience Nor was Eveleen's feelings very different" ufrom those of the young man. Sensations   t such as she had never experienced fbew , thrilled her frame as she gazed into his faes rand listened to his recital of her rescuefrom ' - danger. She could not account for it hexr self-she only knew that it was so, and the i cause of that effect, a ,;e did not even dare to "nquire into. It could not be that the hoys god was trifling with so youthful a heart! It i could not be tho first promptings of love that moved her! O, no-forbid it reason  forbid it, propriety! I will leave William Haviland in bed at his residence, which he reached without mo- tlestation, and return to the cabin of Biddy / rRyan. ".Lie there, alana," said the old: woman, tsoothingly, as she smoothed the pillow be- neath the fatigued gfrl's head, "and shape soundly till the blessed sun crapes over  the hills beyant, whin mesilf will see you' -come." "I hope nothing will happen to that young man," said Eveleen, in a half-abstracted manner.   .        / i' It is Willy Haviland?" exclaimed old Biddy--"arra, well, thin, rme darlint, niver fare for him-the vilyans would rather run from him nor attack him-sure it's many a toss he gev the likes o' thim before. Willy iHaviland's a bould gossoon ana a nate wan, too-an' a good hearted wan to thim he likes --but he has the black spot upon 'him, arl you musn't think iv him, darlint." "The black spot!" said Eveleen, in some surprise, and looking earnestly into the eyes of the old woman; " what do you mean by the ' black spot,' mother V" "He hasn't the praste's blessin," answer- ed old Biddy, in the same tone in which she would have announced that he was a high- wayman or a murderer--" he isn't a Catho- lic, mavourneen!" "Is that all?" said Eveleen, a look of satisfaction taking the place of the painful expression that had settled upon her face. I Is that all?" echoed Biddy; " an' isn't that enough? Sure nothing could be worse nor that! Bud go to shape, darlint, for it's tired you are, an' you'll have the red eye- lids and throbbin timples if you don't get rest." Thus advised, Eveleen turned upon her side and was soon sleeping as sweetly upon the rude bed beneath that humble roof as though she had pressed the eider down, in her uu- cie's mansion. Great was the consternation among Ro- bert Wilson's neighbors, when, On the morning succeeding the abduction of Eve-. leen, it was discovered that the house had been robbed; but if the good people ware surprised at this announcement, what wa" I their rage and indignation when they heard the news that their pet Eveleen. had been 'fourcibly dragged from her bed and cadied off. The sthry spread like wildfire 'among   the surrounding peasantry, and in a short time-in fact before -Mr. Wilson himself was aware of their intentions-a hundred differ- ent parties had started in various directionsj in search of the girl and her captors, Mr. Wilson himself was well nigh frantic with grief at the loss of his niece, for' he had already learned to love her with a depth of devotion which could not have been ex- ceeced even if she had been his own instead of his dead brother's child, and consequently great was his joy when he saw old Biddy Ryan coming down the lane, leading his darling by the hand, perfectly unharmed, and looking as joyous as when she had taken leave of him to retire to rest the nights pre- viously. Quickly did he rush towards-them, and great was-the volubility with which he propounded questions to the old woman, as he bestowed, kiss after kiss upon the brow of Eveleen. For the moment he forgot every other circumstance' connected with the transaction in his joy at the recovery of his heart's idol, but after his first transports were over, a cloud settledmpon his brow as his mind reverted to the robbery and the probable perpetrators of it. Thoughts-- thoughts that he would fain have been a stranger to-obtruded themselves upon him, and- he groaned in agony of spirit, as he tried to chase from his heart the conviction that his son performed a part in-or a t least had a knowledge of-the transaction. He would willingly have given three times the amount that had been taken from him--nay, all j'was worth, for that mattetn-k-to have felt perfectly satisfied that sueh was not the case, but the more he pondered upon the subject the deeper becamne his conviction that his suspicions were just. Eveleen was deeply pained. She divined, as if by intuition, the thoughts that were passing through her uncle's mind, and- has- tened to dispel them. ; "Why are you sad, uncle?" she said, forc- ing a smile; " surely we have cause rather for rejoicing than sorrow-for am I not restored to you, safe and well I Come, smile again, as you did but now-you don't know how happy it makes me to see you merry." "You are right, my child," he answered, as with an effort he threw aside the air of I despondency which had depressed him. " i1 have indeed, reason to rejoice, for you are the only being that binds me to earth at all, and had I lost you I had lost all. I am sure you. love your uncle, Evy, do you not?" he t asked, as he gazed with a father's affection c into her clear blue eyes.   rt "Indeed; indeed I do!" she said warmly. s  ". And you will always-alwa ys love me " - -the same as though I were the father you , have lost instead of his brother--you will always come-to me for advice, and follow "my counsels?" e  "Always, dear uncle," she answered, i " always---for you are my father now, and - to -whom should I go for advice in the hour - I of trouble, if not to you?" "Evy, my child," said the old man, sol- remnly, laying his hand upon her head, " tha 3 day is coming when you will form other at- tachments---when you will experience feel- ings which you now know not of--it jb at that time, more than at any other, that I would wish you to be advised by me." As Robert Wilson said this, Eveleen blushed deeply, as she thought of William Haviland.  Quickly recovering   herself, however, she answered*-- "At all times and under all circumstances, dear uncle, I shall 'regard yogas my first, best friend; and if I thought I pver should form an attachment that would lessen my love for you, I should feel most miserable." "Well, well," he replied, "I think I am safe in your affection." Then turning to Biddy, who stood gazing with an air of devotion at both uncle and niece, he inquired-- "So you say, Biddy, it was William Ha- viland that rescued my darling from  the foul grasp of the villains?" "It was himself and nobody else," replied the affectionate old woman, " and more pow- er to him, he do be always helpin' the waker party. Do you mind the time he throttled Tim Daily for sphaking ill iv Father Mur- phy, although Tim, bad luck to him, was a Pradistant? It's meself that can't -hilp likin' the gossoon, although he says the Pope is no better nor himself, God forgive him." "William  ,Haviland is a noble-hearted young man," said Mr. Wilson, ." but he bas bWfen educated in the wrong school. His parents are both intolerant Protestants, and spring  from a stock- which I detest; and the young man himself, although I do be- lieve him to be a true patriot, and an ardent lover of his country, will have to alter his opinions greatly, concerning theology, before he will appear perfect in my eyes. But see, hereacomes the very person of-whom   we are speaking."     i And, looking up, the party saw the objdt of their discourse approachiig. -  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7813-00000012"/> CHAPTER V. # Good morning, Master Haviland," said Robert 'Wilson, as he grasped the out- etreched hand :of that young gentleman, and shook it heartily. "So there, were robbers and kidnappers in our midst last night l" "It would appear so," said the young man, as he withdrew his gaze from the far- mer, and looked fondly at Eveleen, whose small white hand, he took within his own, and gently shook--" it would appear so; and right glad I am that itf fell to my lot to prevent their carrying off the richest jewel beneath your roof. How is Miss Wilson this, morning?" A"I have entirely recovered from the shock I experienced last night," replied Eveleen, ciasing hek eves upon the ground, and blush- ing deeply at the compliment paid her, "and feel quite lively and well." "I am rejoiced to hear that," said Havi- land, with Warmth, "for I was fearful that the extreme fright which you sustained might l'ead to indisposition." "Oh, Eveleen comes from the right stock," observel the farmer, " and is not easily frightened into sickness. Fear ever feels  itself an unwelcome visitor to the heart that knows no guile, and though it may some- times obtrude itself, its visits are seldom of long continuance ; but come, let us in," and as Robert Wilson ceased speaking, he led -the way 'into the house, followed by the young couple,; old Biddy having found her way into thekidtchen, where, surrounded by a number of Mr. Wilsons dependents, she was narrating with great volubility, 'the oc- currenc es which had given rise to so much excitement. "It is the first trme," said Mr. Wilson, as soon as Eveleen, Haviland, and himself were. seated in the drawing room, " that any attempt of this kind was ever made upon my premises,; but to say the truth, I am not surprised at it. Ham prepared for almost anything now. Our poor old country is in such a distractd state, from the iron heel of oppression that men, driven to despera- tion by poverty and hunger, forget every moral obligation in the desire to escape fam- ine, and are willing to resort to almost any means to ob'tain money." "Affairs are indeed in a dreadful state," answered Haviland, with a sigh, " and the worst of it is, I can see no prospect of their ever becoming better." "There I must differ with you," answered Mr. Wilson. "I look forward .to the day when a war-cry, as if proceeding from the Suited voices of, the fathers of the Holy Church, shall ring through Ireland, touching a chord in the hearts of her peasantry that &amp;all speak her entire freedom from the tyranny of Protestant England."   "Alas, my dear sir," answered Havilad. "I fear it is that very voice of the Cbhureb that will keep' Ireland where she is. *Re. Iligious supremacy, and not the political rights of Ireland, it seems to me, is all that is thought of. The emancipation of our peoplle, if it ever takes place, must be a triumph of principle alone, without regard :to theological prejudices. It must be an up- rising of the masses as one :man, -and the battle cry should be liberty and not religion. The fitness of a man to join so holy a league must not be sought in his religious creed, but in his aspirations after freedom. The man wht eauses for his spiritual adviser to tell him when to strike, cannot be sup- posed to have any opinion of his own as to whether he is oppressed or not, and becomes a mere machine il the hands of another. Why did the Great, Maker of all things endow us with thinking faculties if He did not intend' that we should use them why did he implant in our hearts a sense of right and wrong, if He did. not intend that we should personally act' when subjected to insult or injury? Look at the 'harmonious work- ings of the institutions of glorious America! Not Protestant or Catholic America-but great, enlightened, liberal and free America! Think you that Great Britain would ever have ceased to rule there, had not the heroes of the Revolution, headed by that most God- like of men, Washington, banded together as brothers in a common cause? Think you that if like us, they had been split up into factions, filled with jealousy, bitter prejudices and all uncharitableness, they would- have occupied the position in the world's history which they now do?  No, sir,--they would have failed, as we have ever done. The time is fast approaching when another strug- gle for Ireland will be made, and if it prove a failure--if those engaged in themovement fall -  if will be the fault of over-zealous theological propagandists, and the cause of Ireland will be buried beyond the hope of resurrection." The face of Eveleen glowed with enthu- siasm and beamed with Satisfaction as she listened to the frank speech of Haviland. She was not old enough ever to have studied, the subject deeply, but she felt satisfied of the truth of the sentiments to which she had listened, although she knew full well that they would not meet with her ultra Catholico uncle's approbation. "If the cause of Ireland fail," said Mr. Wilson, whose extreme bigotry was the only drawhack to his otherwise' well-bal- anced character, " through the interference of the Roman Catholic church, it will be the work of Heaven, and will only prove to me that the time for her emancipation, has not yet come." "The work of heaven!" exclaimed Havi- land, with some  surprise, "O, sir, in tke   fact that the cause of Ireland has already once tfailed, entailing, by that failure, star- vation and misery upon our poor 'country- men, the'woik of Heaven. Is it the work of Heaven tlat you cannot travel -in any section of this beautiful,.fruitful, but ill-fated - isle, without meeting scores of howling sup- plicants- for enough food to sustain life? Is it the work of Heaven -that thousands of warm-hearted, iron-framed, muscular rmen, anxious-oh, how anxious!-to, work, are at this moment stretched in God's sunlight, atdtheir cabin doors, without work, without food, without hope! No sir, that Ireland is beautiful and prolific: is the work of heaven, that the hewers of wood and drawers of water upon her soil are not rewarded is the, work of proud, designing, and ambitious, men--men who have, in every age of the" world, sought only for power, plunder, and extended rule." "You are a patriotic enthusiast," said Mr. Wilson, with some show of displeasure at what he considered to be a fling at the Roman Catholic priesthood, "-and have evi- dently never tal en into consideration the efficacy of prayer or the necessity of obedi- ence to the will of God,. who is all-power- ful, and will help those who put their trust in Him, and give heed. to his ministers." "There you mistake me," answered Ha- viland, "I believe in yielding implicit obedi-  ence to the decrees of Providence,t but I also believe that ' God helps those who help thsmselves,' but I am not disposed to attri- bute the ills which man brings upon himself to the workings of the Infinite." Mr. Wilson, who was evidently not very well satisfied with fhe turn the conversation had taken, here arose and excusing himself on the score of having something to attend to, departed, leaving the young people- toge- ther. "What is your opinion upon this subject, bMiss Wilson?" said Haviland, when the farmer had gone. 1 can scarcely be said to have an opi- nion,"' she answered, " with regard to'the means which should be pursued to bring prosperity and happiness to Ireland-I am a mere child, and dare not presume even to think upon a subject of so much weight, but I have often -thought-and seriously, too-- that the bitter sectarian feeling which ex- ists here is wrong-very wrong. I cannot conceive how a person can believe against conviction. I am a Catholic-my confessor tells me that my religion is the .true one. I believe him, and ;should think it very hard if forcel by a Protestant to express a belief with my lips which my heart did not prompt ---o in like manner, I should- think I was doing very wrong to interfere with another's religion *" "Do you believe in all that the Catholic   x religion teaches!" asked Haviland, lookinl - intently at Eveleen. "That is a question," said the youg girl, ( "which it would be impossible for me to r answer, since I do not in reality know all I that it does teach. In fact, I have always felt that something else besides a due obser- 3 vance of forms and tenets was necessary to F gainCor us an admittance into Heaven. I , love God, because I believe Him to be just,  and merciful, and loving--and because I , have an innate feeling that He is pleased t with me when I do right, and offended with 3 me when I do wrong. When 1 go to corr- , fession I do not consider my sins forgiven F because I receive absolution from the priest, !. but because 1 feel heartily sorry for having ,-committed them, and because I determine Knot again to offend." "You are a good Catholic," said Havi- land, with emphasis; ' H wish there were a I few thousands in Ireland who held the same  belief, and there would be a different state of things here speedily. But the, opposite/ is the case-instead of unanimity and har-  mony, discord and jealousy prevail to such  an extent that men will not help themselves through fear of helping their neighbors." L" 1 am sorry that it is so," said Eveleen, and I hope the day will come when there will bhe more tolerance and less bigotry on all sides." "Amen," ejaculated Haviland fervently. , You speak like a true lover of human rights, Miss Wilson, and I fear your senti mento would not exactly suit your spiritual adviser." "I know they would not," she answered, "' I have been reprimanded more than once for the license which I gave my tongue. I cannot help it, however, for I consider it not only foolish but wicked to think one thing and say another." "Ireland has not only a beautiful but an able advocate in you, young as you are, Miss Wilson," said Haviland, as he arose to take his leave--"Good morning. I trust it will not be long ere we shall see each other again, for really it is so seldom I meet one with whom I can converse so unreservedly on any favorite theme' that I can scarcely speak my gratification while listening to you.  "You are pleased to set too high a value upon my poor merits," -replied' Eveleen, modestly, " and. such praise from your lips will, I fear, have a tendency to'raise my self-esteem and make me proud. At the risk of becoming inflated with an idea -of my own importance, however, I must beg the favor of your company at our house as often as you can make it convenient." "Thank you," answered Haviland, as he pressed her hand; "it is the favor of all others that I would have asked, for I doubt not that between us, we. may one day brin.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7813-00000013"/> your uncle over to our way of thinking. So, once more, good morning." "Gpod morning," answered Eveleen, and Haviland departed. "How eloquent and warm-hearted he is'!" said the young girl to herself, as she arose and went to the room from which she had the night previously been so ungere- moniously taken.  In a few days all was again tranquil bpon the estate of Mr. Wilson. The events that had so -seriously disturbed the good people -. were well nigh forgotten, and the farmer managed, in a great degree to tranquilize his mind. One morning when Eveleen, as was her usual wont, had started out to take a walk in the open air, she saw her uncle coming towards her, with satisfaction de- picted upon his benevolent countenance, an open letter in his hand, and a dirty,-ragged, wild-looking boy, at his side. "Joy. joy, Eveleen!" he cried, as. he ap- proached her; "the heaviest weight that his ever pressed upon this old heart has ben removed by the receipt of this letter. It is from Bernard, my son, who has re- pented of his disobedience, and will soon be with me again. You will be surprised, my child, when I tell you that I more than half suspected he was concerned in the attempt to carry you off; but all such suspicions have now 'vanished, and I am the happiest old man in -Ireland. But read, read ' and me-handed her the letter, Eve-een opened the sheet, and read as follows: "DEAR FATHERR,-I have Just learned with the deepest regret, that your Huse has  been entered and robbed, and an attempt made to carry off my cousin. I could not help thinking, as I listened to the disagree- able recital, that I was greatly to blame for such a misfortune. I could not put off the conviction, that had I been with you, suceha 1 thing could not have happened, and this led me to think upon my past conductl The result of reflection has- been that I am heartily ashamed of my transgressions, and have determined, like the prodigal son of l1d, to arise and go to my father, and say i unto him, Father, I have sinned against \ Heaven and before thee. Dare I'hope that 1 you will forgive me? That you will again X take me to your heart? I fearI 'am asking r too much, and I can only beg, that if you refuse to see me, you will at least grant me i your forgiveness, and I will at once de- 1 part from a country which, by my misdeeds, I have disgraced, and seek an asylum in some other land, where, by a life of sincere ' penitence, I may atone for my past wicked- I ness. it is with a heart full of emotion, i a&amp;d a trembling hand, I write these few i lines, the bearer of which will receive your 1 amwer, which, like a criminal awaiting E   sentence, I look for. Do not attempt todir, cover my whereabouts. Through motiovel of regard for you, I am constrained to keep my abode a secret.  Write quick, dear father, and let me know my fate.  "Your affectionate and penitent son, "BERNARD W1LSON." "My poor boy!" exclaimed Mr. Wilson, when Eveleen had finished the perusal of the letter, "I will write at once, announ- cing my forgiveness!" and bidding Eveleen take the boy in, and see, that he was well fed, he went to his own room, and was soon employed in answering his son's letter at which task I will at present leave him en- gaged, and in the meantime will bestow a little attention upon Bernard and his com- panions. CHAPTER VI. ON the road from Carlow to Waterford, is a posting place called Ballyhale-about as celebrated for its big pigs as Kerry is for its little cows-the whole district of country around which, to a man fond of cul. tivating pacific relations with his neighbor, should be avoided. It is just about the worst locality in all Ireland for a man with any pretensions to respectability. to settle in, though a stranger could travel through it with safety, for the majority of the people, although they would not hesitate for a mo- ment to murder the man who should attempt to take land over them, possess, neverthe- less, in a great degree, that characteristic of Irishmen throughout the world, hospi- tality. For miles in this region not a gentle. man's mansion is to be seen, and in a hilly district through which the traveler to Water- ford has to pass, the inhabitants are wild and reckless in the extreme, and some of them are equal to any crime, however hor- rible.         .  . It was towards this district that Bernard Wilson and his two associates took -their, way; and it was in a miserable cabin in that region, the proprietor of which gloried in the name of Thady Doyle, that Ber- nard Wilson lay stretched upon a bed of pain, about a week after the unsuccessful attempt upon the life of Eveleen and the robbery of the elder Wilson's house. "Where is that devil's bird whom you sent with the letter '?"'he inquired of an-ill- favbred, uncouth-looking being that stood beside him; " will he never return ." "Is it Timmy?" answered the man-- "well, thin, divil a quicker boy iver step- ped, barrin' timptations. Bud here he is now," and as he finished speaking, -the boy we have before mentioned as having de- livered Bernard's letter to Mr. Wilason showed his head at the cabin door.   ^Have you get the answer ." asked Bernard impatiently. The boy, who seemed rather economi- cal of words, merely nodded his small nut- like head affirmatively, and approached the bed- with one hand in his coarse, terrier- like hair, and the other grasping a letter, Bernard snatched the epistle hurriedly, and as he was about breaking the seal, he discovered the handle of a silver spoon pro- Cruding fropm the boy's pocket. "What have you got there?" he ex- claimed, jointing to the article. "'Spoon." said the boy, as he pulled the article forth. "By all that's rascally!" said Bernard, "the young imp of Satan has stolen a spoon from the kitchen. Did you purloin anything else?" "Yes;' said the boy, as diving first into one capacious pocket and then into the other, he pulled forth first a couple of eggs, then a like number of' huge potatoes, and eventually a black cord, to which was at- tached a gold cross set with emeralds, and a pair of scissors. "Where did you steal this?" said Ber- nard, as he snatched the trinket. "I clipped it from the chlleen's neck wid the scissors,"' answered'the boy. "It is Eveleen's'" said Bernard, as he ob- served his cousin's name delicately en- graved upon the back of it, then rolling the cord around it and placing it in his pocket, he added,'; and I may one day find use 'for it." It was, indeed, Eveleen's-the gift of her dead father-she prized it above everything earthly, and was inconsolable when she dis- covered her loss, which she could not ac- count-for, as she had ever taken the greatest care of it. "Vanish, you young hell-hound," said Bernard, as he proceeded to read his father's letter, " vanish, and take your booty with ryoul." The bov did not need a second bidding, but left the room, followed by his father, and when Bernard was alone,- he read as follows: '"MY DEAR SON:--With feelings of the most lively gratification, I hasten to answer your epistle, so expressive of real sorrow ,and penitence for errors committed, and so indicative of' a determination on your part t? lead a new life. O, my dear Bernard, I have not felt so great a degree of joy since your mother flpst placed you, an in- a fant in 'my longing arms, and covering you t With kisses, 1 inwardly prayed God that o you might live to be a blessing to us both, and an honor to the land that gave you t birth. Your mother died, and then you d qioFned doubly dear to me-day by day I g watched your rapid growth, and in my great f   love for you, I lost sight of the fact that the human heart' is prone to evil; I was blind to your defects, and could only -se your merits. It-was a fatal error, for I am ' satisfied that it tended to destroy your better nature, and lead you into that vicious course which has proved so- destUective to my happiness. At first I fondly h .ed that age. and experience would lead you to reflect, but my heart sank within me as I saw you grow daily more inattentive to my counsels and disrespectful to me. At length, Ber- nard-forgive me, Heaven, that I should a ever have entertained such a thought! I was willing to believe that you had even , descended to violence and robbery, did ac-. L tually suspect you of the crime to whiche i you made allusion in your letter. Sinking under the weight of this dreadful suspicion my cup of bitterness was full to-.over- A flowing, and I do believe my gray hairs , would speedily have been 'brought down in I sorrow to the grave,' had I not at length re- ceived assurance that you was awakened to I a full sense of your sinfulness, and that you was not guilty of the terrible crime which I imputed to you.  Come to me, my son, at once. Delay not a moment, for I long to I embrace you, and to tell you that you are forgiven. As to the robbery of my house, it is of no importance. Tbe loss of a few thousand pounds is nothing in comparison with the joy I feel at regaining a son; and for the attempted abduction of my niece, the villain who was foremost in the work, sus- e tained a severe injury at the hands of 'Wil- liam  Haviland, a brave, but wrong-headed young man, and Eveteen escaped uninjured. So  you see, I have every reason' to -be thankful, for 'all's well, that ends well.' Come, then, Bernard, and come quickly. "Your affectionate father, i"ROBERT WILSON." "Death and the devil!" hissed Bernard Wilson, as he crushed the letter in his clench. ed hand. "So, then, I am. indebted to Bill Haviland for that knock down in the lane'! It shall g6 hard, but I'll be even with him; twice had he crossed my path before that --once in an affair of love, in which he was not at all interested, arid once in a quarrel of which he said I had thewrong side. When next we- meet, if circumstances are favor- able, I think we shall have a settlement, and the balance will be in my favor." As he ceased speaking, Pat Flanders and Bill Stark entered the room. "Top o' the mornin' to ye, master Wil. son," exclaimed the former, as he drew neai the bedside of Bernard, " how is ivery bit o' ye by this time?" "O, I'm gaining strength rapidly," said the wounded man, "and in the course of a day or two  shall --be about again. . bhaye gat. an answer to the letter I sent my father."  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7813-00000014"/> U Have you now .t" said Pat, "and what does the old gentleman say ' "O, he befieves in my sincerity, and has invited me home again," replied Bernard, with a, laugh. "Well, that I mayn't sin, but that's a good wan t" said Pat, "and are you afther nalkin' up'your mind to accept-his invita- tion?" "Yes," answered Bernard, "I shall go home in the course of a day or two, for in order to carry out my plans, I must be on the spot." "And what are your plans e" asked Bill. "My object is," said Bernard, " to regain the confidence of my father by playing the penitent, and then by some means or other, to set him against the brat whom we en- deavored to carry off, so that she may not interfere with my'birthright. The firstpart is easy enough, for he has already forgiven me, but for the-last part I fear I shall find it troublesome, as the young devil has already wound herself so closely around his heart thathe almost worships her. She must be got rid of-some way or other,rat all events, . and as they say the devil isgood to his own,  I have no doubt I shall hit upon a plan. If ] I can once get her out of the house, I will ( follow  her up so closely that if she gets 1 back again with a fair fame, it will be won- - derful. In the mean time I Cant each of I you to hold yourselves always -in readiness ( at this place, which you .must not leave  without my knowledge.  I have no doubt I X ahall have work for you  before long, for a there is a young man of my acquaintance e who needs doctoring and I shall attend to I his case as soon as possible. If I cannot \ succeed in persuading my father to make t me his sole heir, I must take all I can Jay t hands on, and away'to America, where I am I told that a man with plenty of money can c enjoy the largest liberty, and no questions A asked."         The parties seemed very well satisfied 4 with'his arrangement, and three days after- 'a wards,'Bernard was again an inmate -of his t;  father's house.            a Nearly a  year passed by, during which li time, Bernard Wilson, although his course t was quite as vicious as ever, managed, by a remaining more at home, and observing a h demeanor quite different to that which had n previously characterized him, to hide the tE fact from his indulgent father Day after t day, did he watch like a snake in the grass for an opportunity to strike and blast his unoffending victim, but Eveleen knew him- T she was satisfied in her own mind that he fe was the prominent actor in the- outrage to bE which she had been subjected, and she was hi ever on the alert to guard against his ma- p I chinbtions. In vain did he endeavor, by pr every art, to gain her esteem-she would thi answer him kindly, but coldly, and never be,   at would she remain even for a moment al with him. She was afraid of him, and; he as knew it, yet did he wait patiently, in the ex- d, pectation that sooner or later the wished-for opportunity; would arrive. Neither could a he get an opportunity to wreak' his ven- er geance upon William Haviland who 'had a- become -a frequent visitor at his father' house, for he as if by instinct knew that ro Bernard was his enemy, and carefully n avoided him. He had two different times n been shot at on his way home at night, and on fOne occasion barely escaped with his life, I. a ball passing through his hat. Aithoughk tr he had no proof of the fact, it was his con- e viction that Bernard Wilson waIs concerned r, in these attempts at his destruction, but the - thought that his enemy was qousin to Eve- t leen, whom he had learned to love devotedly. t was enough to restrain his wrath, which awould otherwise have led -him to somne act t of retaliations Eveleen, too, grew daily r more and more fond of the society of Havi- t land, and by the time she had reached her e thirteenth year--a period Nhen most girls , of her age have very little idea of serious , attachment-she might be said to have ex- F perienced the premonitory symptoms of un- Iequivocal love. Bernard had let no oppor- tunity pass to poison the mind of his father against Haviland, whom he represented to r be not only a bitter opponent to the Roman Catholic religion, but he even went so far as to insinuate that he was ohe of that nmosth despicable of all wretches, an anti Irishman at heart, and an informer. These assertions constantly repeated, with a character like Mr. Wilson, bad considerable weight, but were not sufficient to satisfy him of the truth of so grave a charge. He .told lhis son that he must be mistaken-that William Haviland, he was sure, could be no such character as he represented him to be. W hen Bernard had exhausted all his powers of dissimulation and falsehood, he resorted /to stratagem. He induced his father to accompany him to the residence of a Protes- tant upon whom suspicion had long rested, and there, under cover of a hedge, they listened to a conversation between Pat Flanders, Thadeus Doyle and Bill Staik, at the porch of the door of the suspected house, in which the name of Haviland was mentioned as the leader of a party of Pro. testant informers. This was satisfactoryt. th -old gentleman did not for a moment sue- pect his son's duplicity in the matter, and Haviland, in his mind, was a marked man. To say the truth, the fdea of any differert feeling than that of friendship springing up between the young'couple had never entered his head, even when Haviland was unsuie pected, or he would have endeavored t prevent it long. before. He had permitted the'visits of the young man; because he bad believed him to be an enthusiastic lover 'a   Ireland, though not "a Catholic, but when his suspicions as to Haviland's patriotism were aroused, he determined to forbid his atring any further companionship with Evoleen. -It was a sad day for Eveleen when her uncle made his determination known to her. In vain she recalled to his mind the many- noble traits in the character of Haviland, and when he assured her that he had proof posilve that her lover was a spy and an in- former, her blue eyes sparkled with indig- nation, and her breast heaved with the tu- lultuous feelings that filled it as 'she 'eked-- U Who is his accuser, uncle i Who is it that ,ares call William Haviland an informer? Is it my cohsin? If he is your informant D -and I feel that he is-why did he not ,ome out openly, fearlessly, like a man, and make the charge . I tell you, uncle, the shade of disgrace never did and nevrer can rest upon the brow of William Hfaviland, and although my duty to you may counsel me to forego the pleasure of his company, yet you requre too muchf of me when you tell me to forget him, for that I can never do if I would. On the contrary, I shall al- ways cherish the remembrance of the happy hours I have passed in his society as the -brightest era in my existence. I may for- get everything else, earthly, but his many acts of kindness to me-among which I may mention his rescue of me from the grasp of ruffians, will always keep his memory green in my heart!" and overcome by her feelings, Eveleen, as she finished speaking, sank into a seat, and burst ihto tears. "Remember your promise of obedience to,me, Eveleen," said her uncle, solemnly- This is the first time 1 have ever attempt- ed to control your actions-do not deny my first request." -"I have promised you obedience, uncle," she answered, drying her tears, " and 1 will not see him again, since you )vill it-but I must write to him explaining tie reason why, For a whole year I have been in the habit of seeing him daily, and I cannot think of dropping his acquaintance without a word of explanation." - "Do so, then," said her uncle, as he left the room, " but your intimacy must cease from that time forward," When Eveleen was alone she sat down, and with a trembling hand wrote to Havi- land as follows:-- "DEAR WILLIAM-With a heart full of sorrow and a brain whll-nigh turned, I sit down to indite the most afflicting iruth/this hand has ever penned.- I can scarcely cre- dit that I am awake while I write, for it does not seem to me that there can be, iven in this dark world of tribulation, so sud.   den- a transition from unalloyed happimen to bitter woe; O, William, must I pen thim hateful words . After near a year: of unbro ken joy and sweet - intercourse between us, my, uncle has decreed -that we must part-he has commanded me to forget you. Forget you! Can I forget that 1 live, breathe, and move  Can I forget that I have sat for hours as if spell bound, beneath the magic of your voice? Can I forget that you have ever been to me all that a lover should be, and more than a brother could be--my soother in affliction, my c ounsellor in trouble, my defender in danger! Forget you! not till death shall 'have stilled the pulsations of my: heart, and the immortal part of me shall have fled to that heaven of bliss where sorrow cannot dwell. and even then, if, as some. people assert, the spirits 'of the departed are permitted to revisit the scenes of their early jovs, I will be ever near you. Wi may be separated here, dear William, but no earthly power can prevent the commingling of our souls!  , "You have been slandered, 'William-- 'foully-,slandered--you have been charged with that of which the meanest reptile that drags his slimy length along the earth, were he gifted with knowledge should be ashamed. You have been accused of holding inter- course with Informers-the most contempt- ible of all'God's creatures. I know not who is your accuser, but I can gkess, and so canb , you-the bitterest enemy tw us both in twhi world, my cousin. I know not what proof he has given my uncle to satisfy him that the charge is true, but that you have been con. victed upon some testimony other than his word, I am certain. Trace the black false- hood to its source, dear William, and make your innocence as manifest to the world as it is to me. I do not require even a refuta- tion of so foul a charge from you,.but tie warm-hearted peasantry by whom you are surrounded are not apt to reflect when their cause is endangered -.they are- impulsive, their imaginations easily worked upon by bad men, and in their zeal for Ireland, they might, should such a story go abroad, do you harm. "And now, dear William, I must bid you farewell, but let us not despair.  Go4workl by means that we know not of, and behind the clouds that now frown upon us, may be hidden the serenest joy.

She found the poor old creature greatly agitated, wringing her hands and indulging in the most immoderate grief. ' What ails you, mother?" said Eveleen, as she took the hand of the old woman with- in her own.  "O , whirra whirra!" exclaimed Biddy, "that iver r Willy Haviland should turn informer! But it's all owin' to his want iv riverence! Sure, it's only the divil that could ever lade such a heart as his asthray i." "Who told you he was- an informer, mother?" asked Eveleen, quietly. "Who tould me, is it?" replied Biddy, "o'hone! o'hone! who- didn't tell me? Sure iverybody for miles around knows it, an' it's mesilf would rather have hard iv his death, as much as I loved him." "It is not true, mother," said Eveleen ; it is a wicked lie invented by my cousin, to lower William in the estimation of my uncle. It is a falsehood, and William will prove it such in time." "D'ye think he will, darlint?" said Biddv, eagerly jumping at anything that would tend to clear Haviiand, " an' are ye sure it was Bernard that riz the report?" A"I am satisfied of it in my own mind,"'  said Eveleen, " although I have no proof of ' it. My uncle has forbidden me to associate with William  any longer, and here is a letter which I wish you would deliver to a him."                 I "I'll do it, darlint- I'll do it," replied Biddy, " but oh, don't I wishi me two eyes ; may see the bright day whin the gossoon J will prove himself worthy iv your love!"  When Eveleen returned to the mansion, t she found her uncle and Bernard together. t They had evidently been engaged in a con- t versation of no very agreeable nature, for f the elder Wilson's brow  was clouded by anger. As  the young girl entered the r room, she cast a look so full of scorn and s contempt upon Bernard that he, marble- o hearted as he was, cowered beneath her u glance of virtuous indignation, and retired if from the apartment leaving his father and so her together.             a "Uncle," said Eveleen, throwing her E arms around Mr. Wilson's neck, "I have n one request to make -one favor to ask, n even at the risk of inburring your dis- cc pleasure."               p "Wha    it " hasked the farmer coldly. Mi "1The crime  with which tWilliamn Havi. ol la4 ais, charged," she replied, "lhas gone vi abro'd'month  p6ople, they believe him dr guilty.; r satisfied he is innocent.

Dt d, not deny me this favor." st  "Eveleen," said her Uncle, disengaging her arms from his neck, and looking sternly n, at her, " listen' to me. When your father h- died, I regarded you as my child. He be- queathed you to me, and I swore to love y, you, and to use you exactly as though you n were my own. I will keep that oath.' T v could not love you. more tenderly than- I do, t were you a thousand times my child, but I s would rathex see you lying dead before me than to have you spend another hour in the r, company of that man. Now,hear my last words with regard to him. I do not wishyvou r, ever to mention his name in my presence.  He must be as strange here as though he ;, had-never existed, and on no pretence, even s to the saving of his life, must you again see him. If, in your foolish infatuation for him, ; you so far forget your duty to me as to hold , intercourse with him, even t6the extent of y one word, you are thenceforward no child of 1 mine, and must-seek elsewhere that protee. tion which, by such a course, you will for- feit under my roof.' Forget him, my girl I and you will be happy; cling -to him, and you will be forever miserable." "Is this a charitable decision, uncle?" , said Eveleen, as a tear glistened in her eye, f and the next moment rolled down her fair cheek. "It is a just one," was the reply; " at all events, it is unalterable," and with a measured step, Mr. Wilson left the apartment. Bernard Wilson had now fairly coramen- ced the formation of a plot to remove Eveleen from his uncle's house, which he had no doubt would be successful. He knew that his cousin was devotedly at- tached to Haviland, and he felt certain that the course which he had induced his father to pursue, would tend to lessen her love for him. Furthermore, he had, with the aid of his confederates,' succeeded in ar- raying the people against Haviland, by spreading thefreport that he was a paid spy of the British government-a character than which no other by which Ireland is cur is held in greater abhorreneTand very justly so. The informer is genIally to be found  among the more bigoted clads of Protestants. He is a man whose bitter intolerance and narrow-minded views will allow him to see nothing good in any movement or act not connected with the advancement of his owrn particular creed; he will not hesitate for a moment to sacrifice his .country on the altar of sectarian supremacy ; he possesses a vindictive, overbearing disposition, and a desire to rule with a rod of iron takes pre- cedence of every other feeling in his breast. Especially is his hatred mrost deep and deadly against the Roman Catholic religion, and hie would think no more of killing a mehiber of that persuasion, than if ne (t6h   Cabtholic) were a mad dog instead of a hu- 'man being. Such being the case, it is not at all surprising that Eveleen should feel alarmned for the safety of her lover, and de- -eire to caution him against the blind wrath of the abused people. On the day following that on which Eve- een had sent her letter to Haviland, she took her way to old Biddy's cottage, in the hope of receiving an-answer bf some kind; but she was doomed to disappointment, for the old woman informed her that he was i from home, when she got to his house, that she had left the epistle, and had neither heard of nor seen him since. As she was returning, dispirited and melancholy, to the mansion, Bernard Wilson passed her; and as they looked at each other, a gleam of savage triumph sparkled in his wild, dark eye; and the girl shudde;ed involuntarily, aS. she encountered his gaze.- He passed on, however, without speaking, and was soon lost to view; while Eveleen, as she entered her uncle's house, exclaimed to her-' self,-"The very look of that man has be- come painful to me-I dread to meet him!" Bernard Wilson kept on his way moodily, ever and anon dropping some such expres- sion as "The trap is set and the game will \ soon spring it I Look to thyselfi my dainty cousin-the end of thy reign is near, or I am no%-prophet! and thy graceful lover, too! 'tis a pity that so handsome a prospect of earning a big name should be suddenly blighted, but it is the fate of genius to meet with reverses, and I do not know why he should be an exception to the general rule." Thus indulging in dark communings with himself, he came to a tumble-down tene- ment, situated a short distance from the main road upon which he was traveling, and nearly hidden from view by the tall bushes of rank growth which skirted the highway on either side. Pushing the door open, he entered with a "God save all here!" and was immediately greeted by Pat Flanders, with- "' Ah, ha, Masther Wilsoni how is ivery bit o' ye ." "I feel exceedingly light-hearted and like business," was the answer. "In fact, I don't know when I have felt so well!" \"Oh, you're afther doin' some wa- tt) d  actions for which you are so famo,'" id Pat, with a chuckl ' li e- iaust well, whin hA2always doin' a  good fo some  XkOh, teaya  d--d -senseless gibber- a ixshq' baid Bernard testily, " and listen to whalt'tin-e to say." Then looking at the t occupa  of the cottage, an old woman, I nearly Blind with age, and her spouse, who v was abput as decrepit as herself, lihe said, 1 ,"  eme outside; I wish you to walk a V Iho odistance with me."  -   . /F  aith, Ill do that same," answered 1       ,   - Pat, I'll not fault ye, for givin' me a- t chance to stretch my legs."  1  "I don't know whether old Dougherty and his wife would be pleased with our pro- I ceedings if made aware .of them, or not," said Bernard, when- they stood in the open -air, " but it's best to be safe. Where are e Starlk and Doyle?"  Where should they be but at Thady's cottage?" answered Pat. r"Well, I want you to go after them with- out delay," said Bernard. "1; have work for you all. I have concocted a plan which I think cannot fail to lead to a blow-up be- tween my father and his neice "  -. W What is it " rInquired Pat, listening eagerly. "Eveieen," continued Bernard, has writ- ten a letter to Bill Haviland, informing him that he has been charged by me with being an informer, and calling upon him to refute the slander. This letter she entrusted to the care of Biddy Ryan, who promised to take it to Ifaviland's house. I knew I could do nothing in the way of bribing old Biddy, for she's foolish enough to be hornest--besides, she hates me ; so I bribed a hanger-on around Haviland's house, who received the letter from the old woman, passed it to me, and I took the liberty of substituting for it another with my father's signature' at the bottom of ,it, forbidding him the house, without asigning 'any cause, and stating that Eveleen knew and approved of the decision. I met her an hour ago, on her way from Biddy's cottage, whither she had doubtless been to get an an- swer to her letter. She of course is not satisfied et the result of her visit, and will certainly return again and again in the hope of hearing something from him. Now you know there is a thicket a short distance from Biddy's house. I want you and Stark to conceal yourselves there, and as she passes, attract her attention by uttering in a subdued tone, but loud enough for her to heari the name of her lover. In the present state of feeling against Haviland, sahe- will -at once imagine that somebody is plotting to take away his life, and will stop to listen.

She will then fly to save. him, which you must not prevent.  In the meantime, I will inform my father that Eveleen, contrary-to hit express commands, is in the habit of visiting Haviland at his house. He, of course, will disbelieve me at first, when I will offer to give him a proof of it. I will have it so timed, that when he thinks her in bed, he shall find her in the arms of her lover. The result is easily foreseen-she is cast off, Bill Haviland is forced to fly, if a dose of cold lead does not save him the trouble, and I triumph. Is not this a glorious plan 1" "The divil himself couldn't have med a better one," answered Pat, " conshurnin' to me, bud you're an illegant plotter. When'll we commence the play?" "The sooner the better," answered Ber- nard, " we must work fast, or we may fail." ,' Wel, thin, T'll be off to Thady Doyle's at once, an' the evenin' afther to-morrow, 3 the first actshall take place, an' at tin o'clock the same night, we'll have the grand denow- ment, as we say in Frinch.-Will that shute you ." "That will do excellently," answered Ber- nard, " now away with you and about it.!" and so the fiends separated. Three days had passed since William i Haviland had been- permitted to speak to  Eveleen, and further than the few cold words i contained in the laconic epistle sent him by t Bernard Wilson. he had heard nothing of 3 her. He had seen her on two or three occa. sions as she was going to and from old Bid- ( dy's cottage, and might have stopped her and ; asked foran explanation; but he was too proud 1 to do that. He loved her truly, deeply, de- votedly-she no longer seemed a child to 1 him, but a woman--and one in whose defence he would have poured forth his heart's blood I as freely as water. But he would not speak to her while he thought she misjudged him. i tIe had heard of the report which had- been i raised concerning him, but -he could not trace c it to any source, and consequently could not c refute it at once, Three long, long days I had passed, and he sat at a table in the draw- ing-room of the house in which he resided, v pouring over the pages of a history'of the C rebellion of '98. No man living entertained t a deeper disgust for the class of men of b whom he was reputed to be one, than -him. 8elf. He cared not for what a man's religion  was--it wad a subject into'which he did not .i feel himself justified n. inquiring, and he s   d would full as soon have. been.. called a l r derer, as in -informer. His mind was: ei- n dently not fixed upon the Subject upon whib r. he was reading, fort after turning the leaves 1u over rapidly for a'while, he closed the book, "exclaiming as he did so, with a sigh-, o  "If Eveleen is willing to believe me guilty of so heinous an offence, and condemns me fwithout a hearing, she cannot love me as I I had fondly hoped she did, and I must leave 1 her without even attempting to. make my n character clear before her.

O, Ireland--dear Ireland-thou other god- dess of my idolatry, I must leave thee too, at least for a tithe, for thine enemies seek my life, and though I ask no other boon than to die for thee now, yet I must work for thee i first." As he arose from  his soliloquy', his ear  caught the sound of a quick, light foot-fall,  and the next moment he started at hearing  the sound of his own name. "Heavenly Father!" he exclaimed, "surer i ly that was Eveleen's voice!"  He listened eagerly fof a few moments, I but all was silent as the grave.  "Alas! alas!" he exclaimed, "mvy excited? imagination hears her sweet, plaintive voice S in every wind that blows--Oh, Eveleen! i dear Eveleen!" he continued, " would that I  could in reality again clasp thee to my I heart!"

The heart of William Haviland beat wild- ly as he gazed upon the pale countenance of the beautiful girl who lay senseless in his arms, and for a moment he could scarcely divest himself of the idea that he was dream- ing. Arousing himself st length, however, he pressed her closely to his heart, and im- printing a burning kiss upon her almost colorless lips, he said-- "' It may be the last time our lips will ever meet, and even were you conscious, you would not blame me for it-although you love me not - did you but know how wildly I have worshipped you." As he finished speaking, he placed her in an easy chair, and taking a small pitcher from the table at which he had been writing, he sprinkled a few drops of water upon her white forehead, and soon had the satisfaction of. observing symptoms of returning con- iciousness. , I do not know what could have brought thee here at such a time," he said to himself, as she slowly revived, " but if you are pursued by those who seek to do you hkarm, they must reach you over my corpse." "William'!" exclaimed, the maiden, as she threw a frenzied glance around the apartment, evidently unconscious of the presence of the young manr-" jWhere are you, William ." She paused for a moment, and pressed her hands against her throbbing temples, as if endeavoring to collect her scattered senses-at length she exclaimed, "O, now I remember-he was here when I arrived, but they have dragged him hence, and are perhaps even now engaged in his murder! I will 'follow them-I will go4 forth into the dark night, and if he but sigh I will hear it even above. the voice of the wind--I will supplicate, implore, struggle t with the ruffians, and if I cannot save, at I least I can die with him!?' She sprang. towards the door, and Havi- land, in whose breast the suspicion that she I had ceased to love him had given place to the most extatic hope, exclaimed-  "Eveleen--dear Eveleen E!"  She turned suddenly, and the next mo- l nment, with a cry of joy, rushed into his: arifts. . "'You are safe, then," she said, as'she ' gazed into his face with sweet emotion e depicted on her angel-like countenance- - "safe, and they have not injuredd you, not e even to the extent of a scratch!" and drop- ping her head- upon his bosom, she sobbed ; eonvulsively, ,Who has not- injured me?" inquired ' 'Villiam, kindly, as he gently kissed her- ' irhat fiend has;been operating on your too I sensitive nature, darling - :Speakl to me- i '    tell -re aFl--for my sen ae obfused; my   brainiwhirls, it almost seems to me that I anm under the- influence of some spell, or that I am dreaming-If this be indeed a dream, however, it is a sweet- one, and -would to God the illusion would never be dispelled, for I am holding you in my arms--I can feel the tumultuous beating of your heart against my own, and the world;, an hour since to me so cold and cheerless, is bright and beautiful once more."  "1 Yes, they wero fiends," she said, allud- ing to the first part of his speech--":horrible fiends! O,. William, I listened to-a plot for your destruction, the very remembrance ot which fills-me with terror!" Eveleen then related to her lover, in as few words as possible, what the reader al- ready knows, and suddenly checking herself in an expression of tenderness as she finished the recital, she said, as she looked reproach- fully at Haviland, "But I forgot in my anx- iety for your safety that you no longer loved me!" "No longer loved you, Eveleen?" ex; claimed the young man, in a surprised and somewhat reproachfiul tone, as he drew her more closely to his breast--" O, Eveleen, since the last time I enjoyed the sweet pli- vilege of conversing with you beneath your uncle's roof, your image has been ever pre- sent in my mind. When from a restless pillow I have arisen in the morning, my thoughts have been of you-in the oppres- sive noontide if I wandered through the woods *, walked beside a purling stream, you, in imagination, Was ever at my side, and when disheartened and weary, I sought my bed at night, condemned by my fellow- man-innocently condemned, Eveleen, I call Heaven to witness-the victim of foul slan- der-still, still, among thedark countenances of the enemies which iny imagination con- jured up, yoursweet face, like a bright star shining in the midst of the warring elements, smiled luminously updn me, and I sighed when I thought how impotent would be their wrath if you believed me guiltless., O, Eve leen how could you think someanly of me?" "So meanly of you, William -" she said, with a puzzlEd expression of countenance- then, as a light seemed to break suddenly upon her, she inquired, " did you not receiva a letter from me?"  "A letter-from you," answered the youth. "No, dear Eveleen, I received a cold, la- conic note from. your uncle, the contents of which he said you endorsed, forbidding' me ever again to enter his house or speak to you, this is the only letter which I have re- ceived." "Then there has been, treachery some- where," said Eveleen, " for my father never wrote it. - I am certain old Biddy would not play me false, and my, cousin must be the author of this new injury."   t At this point in: their conversation, their  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7813-00000017"/> attention was attracted to the sound of heavy footsteps upon the stair, leading to the room in which they stood. In a moment Eve- leen's former fears returned, and she almost shrieked- "They come-they come!   Lock the door, William, or-they will murder you!" "Do not be alarmed, dear Eveleen," said Haviland, as, following her advice, he turned the key in the lock, and took a pair of pistols from a-case which stood upon the table- "a strong arm, a clear conscience, and a de- termined heart, are more than a match for a dozen midnight assassins!" -"Open this door!" authoritatively ex- claimed the voice of Robert Wilson from the outside, "or I will obtain assistance, and force it open." "Great Heaven!" exclaimed Eveleen, who up to this time had entirely lost sight of the fact that she -had violated the pledge she had made--" it is my uncle's voice, and I am lost." "Robert Wilson need never resort to force to gain admittance to any apartment of mine, ' said Haviland, ashe unlocked and thlrew open the door. "It is notat all likely," answered the far- mer, as he gazed with lowering brow first at the trembling girl and then at her lover "that Robert Wilson twill ever again have occasion to seek admittance to your apart- ments, under any circumstances; nor should I have done so now, but that I was deter- mined to see with my eyes what my heart refused to believe. Eveleen," he exclaimed, "dare you look me in the face!" The poor girl, fairly paralyzed with fear, could not move a muscle, but stood rooted to the spot, with her eyes, bent upon the ground. "I perceive," said her uncle, bitterly," that shame has rendered you dumb. It is a cir. cumstance that I 'hardly looked for, for I had supposed that you had lost all sense of shame."             I   a At this unjust allusion to her character, c the blood- rushed into the face of Eveleen, 1 and raising her head proudly, she said, look- 1 ing the while indignantly through the tears I tha; filled her bright blue eyes- - "Uncle, you will one day be sorry for that c reproach  appearances, I own are against r me, and had you, as my father would hi ve c done had he been living, chid me gently and d called upon me to clear myself from suspi- i cion, I should have endeavored to do so; I but since you are willing to suspect my l character for 'chastity, it is not at all likely t that you will /believe in -my veracity, land ] silence is the only course left me." - "It is at least your wisest course,"-said C Mr. 'Wilson, now more than ever exasper- ated at the tone of defiance which his niece  'had assumed--'*for guilt should remain m silent; and that you may not cherish in any a   ry corner of vour heart a hope that I am lta. m acquainted with the full extent of your trans* e- gressions, I may as well inform you, that st since this irreverent scoffersat religion:; this traitor to his country, to whom you have e decided-to cling, was forbidden my house, you have been watched, and have been d traced on each night to this house." d  "Mr. Wilson," said Haviland, the grosser s part of whose nature was thoroughly aroused -by the language of the farmer, and whose - soul seemed to be concentrated in the indigo a nant look which. sparkled in his dark eye, "you have made use of language in relation - to me, which would likely have cost any n other man than Eveleen Wilson's uncle, d his life-but let that pass; for myself, I neither ask your friendship nor your favor , --in fact, until you have made the most t ample apology for the insult you have put oupon me, we must remain enemies, but I owe i it to this trembling maiden; this more than angel, to assure you that, up to a few mo  D ments ago, I have not spoken to her since t my visits to your house were discontinued, I I beseech you, sir, before you take any step which -may embitter all your- after life, to - pause and reflect. I solemnly assure you, t upon thv-word and honor of a man, that the , object Miss Wilson had in view when she came here to-night, was a most praise- worthy one, and one in which you, in com- i mon with every human being who has a spark of humanity in his composition, must ; applaud. She came---- "I know what she came for," interrupted the choleric old gentleman, impatiently, L "and I have no doubt you consider her o- 1ject very praiseworthy, but I happen to hold a different opinion. And now," he conti- nued, addressing Eveleen, "a few words twith you, and I have done. You have for- feited all claim to my protection by your un- dutiful conduct. I might, were I so dis- ' posed, force you to live beneath my roof, and exact from you that obedience which a child owes a parent. I do not choose to take such a course. There is no virtue in the performance of a duty against which the heart rebels, and as you have marked nut a path to suit yourself, I will allow you, with-, out hindrance, to pursue it. You may re- main here if you please, or choose a place of abode somewhere else, and you shall not suffer for means. All your expenses shall be paid as long as you desire it, but in the meantime, I do not wish either to see or hear from you. With these remarks I will take my leave, and. I hope, though full well I know the hope is vain, that the life you have commenced so badly, may be a happy one." At this stage of the proceedings, the lady of the house in which Haviland resided who had been aroused from her sleep by tWi sound of loud voices in disputatia entered   *he room. She was the widow of a de- ceased officer in the army. Her husband, Lieut. Jackson, while living, was well and favorably known, not only as a brave sol- dier, but a generous,- warm-hearted man, and although he died is rather straightened circumstances, he didyot leave his amiable! partner actually in want, for with what, money he left her, and some slight assist- ance from his brother officers, she was en- abled to buy the small piece of property upon which she lived, and managed by great industry and frugality to get along quite comfortably. She had been educated a Protestant, but, like Haviland, she had no sectarian prejudices, and attached about as much importance to one religious denomina- tion as to another. If a poor person called at her house for relief, she never stopped to inquire into his or her creed, but what she! had to give was given as freely to the I  Catholic as to the Protestant. Mr. Wilson I and herself, although they had been near; neighbors for a long time, had never been, i thrown into each other's company, and con-(  sequently had never spoken together, but'  she had often heard Haviland speak of Eve- u leen, and she had conceived an affection for t the young girl almost before she had seen her.  She had heard the report which had 1 been set afloat with regard to Haviland's re- 1 creancy to his country, but it is needless to n state that she attached not the slightest im- t portance to it.. She had known him from e his boyhood, and she would as soon have t looked for virtue in a fiend as for dishonor in him.                 a Mrs. Jackson could not comprehend the 3 scene which was presented before her-to a her it was all a mystery. Haviland had long . before made her acquainted with the state v of his feelings towards Eveleen-he had also v shown her the letter forbidding his further t intercourse with the girl of his heart, and n the widow was at a  loss to imagine what c could possibly have brought the trio together n at such an hour, and under such circunlstan- v ces. She was perfectly satisfied, however, p both of the integrity of Haviland and the a virtue of Eveleen, and had resolved in hler g own mind to give them both her countenance c and support.           . As the farmer ceased speaking, she re- ti marked-- - "I cannot understand, Mr. Wilson, what *' has led to this most disagreeable meeting, g but certain I am that there is some misunder- a standing, which a  little explanation would tl set right. Your niece I do not think would it willingly do anything to incur your displeas- it ure, and William, I know, is above trickery al or fraud of any kind."         fI "Excuse me, Madame," replied the farmer cl stiffly, "you, of course, have a perfect right at to your opinion, which- is just such a one as fu I should expect to hear from the friend and as   - confidant of William Haviland- but with all 1, due deference to you, I must claim the saWmi d privilege. You, I make no doubt, are not - only willing, but anxious to take my niece , under your protection. I had much- rather 1 she would make another choice, but since 1 etcan no longer control her actions; as I said t before, it is at her option to do as she - pleases." '* It is not my desire, and it certainly never has been my practice," replied the widow, ; in a tone of mingle orrow and reproach, "to breed disunion' %f discord between the members of any family-on the contrary, it has everubeen my aim rather to heal than widen abreach of such a nature: but as you seem disposed--on what account I know not-to withdraw your protection from a j young and innoceut girl-one, moreover' who has no immediate relations, although from the sweetness of her disposition, and her many virtues,she had made a friend of almost everybody with whom she has come , in contact, 1 feel it no less a pleasure than a 'duty to offer her an asylum beneath my roof. If Miss Wilson will remain with me until she can suit herself better, I shall-es- teem' it a great favor." "Again I say," replied the farmer abrupt- ly, "Miss Wilson can' do as she pleases." He turned to go, but Eveleen, whose counte- nance while he was addressing her, had turned from red to pale, alternately, with the emotions which filled her, arrested his atten- tion-  , "Uncle,"' she said, with faltering accent, and choking utterance, 1"I have listened to you---now hear me. When my father died"--- and here a sense of her forlorn condition over- whelmed her, and for a few moments she wept bitterly---drying her tears, however, with an effort, she continued---" when my fa- ther died, I felt that the only tie which bound me to life was sundered---for- I loved him as child never loved parent--I never knew a mother's gentle care, but he, in his almost woman-like tenderness, supplied a mother's place.  I did not think I could ever smile again, when they placed him in the dark grave, and I heard the cold -sod fall upon his coffin"'-here retrospection was busy with Mr. Wilson, and he could not restrain the tears which in spite of himself filled his eyes -" at length," continued Eveleen, *' your kindness somewhat assuaged my grief. You took me to your heart and home and. I  had almost taught myself to think that my father's spirit, instead of winging its flight to heaven, had taken up its abode in your breast. You were kind to me, uncle and I thank you for it---I-iave not received from you a  kind look or word that I will not cherish in my breast while I live. But"-- and here she drew herself-proudly up to her full height---the sweet consciousness of- un sullied virtue beamed in her eyes---and witk  &#xD;<pb n="32-33 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7813-00000018"/> te gir of an empress, she continued, "4 you 'ave doubted my- virtue---when you per- mited that doubt to, enter your breast, my father's spirit fled from it, and I -can now only see in you an uncle. I kindly thank you for the offer, you have so generously made, to support one who has no claim upon your bounty, but I must decline the accept- ance of it.. I have already been a burden upon you too long, and I am now fully able to support myself by my own labor. Again I thank you sincerely ifor the kindness I have received at yotir hands, and if, in the course of events, it should happen that I am able to repay you, I shall only be too happy to do so."' This was a reply for which Mr. Wilson was not prepared, anid he looked at the young creature before him with perfect astonish- ment. He was both surprised and subdued, ,Eveleen's allusion to his liberality cut him to the very heart, for he was indeed generous to a fault, and was never so happy as when relieving the sufferings of a fellow crea- ture.---Already he regretted that he had been so hasty, but his stubborn nature kept him from  making any manifestation of his feelings. "Do not add stubbornness to the list of your errors," he said at length; "I 'feel it my duty to see that you want for nothing--- ,besides, I have money belonging to you--- 'te remnant of your deceased father's es- tafte---quite enough, with care, to make you comfortable." "You have told me so before," answered Evejeen, "' but I had forgotten it. I do not object to receive what of right belongs to me, and when I  need it, I will send for it." Mr. Wilson, whose combative disposition c had, up to this time, enabled him to preserve 3 a  stern exterior, felt that his better rature I was fast getting the /Mastery, and fearful v that he might exhibit some show of weak- i ness, he turned upon his heel abruptly, and a left the house without another word. After E he had departed, Eveleen gave full vent to d her pent up grief, and turning to Haviland, e she said,               a "He has gone-the only' relative I have - upon the earth has disowned me, and you, it William, ar the only friend that's left mie oi now; shoul lu cease to love me, then d farewell hope'd welcome death!"    d "Will not Miss Wilson consider me  a h friend?" said the widow, affectionately, as fe she embraced and kissed the weeping to girl.                 of "And can Eveleen doubt that my love tl will be as lasting as my life?" asked Havi- la land, reproachfully. " O, Eveleen, from di the moment thatci gazed upon you, pale and or deathke, but still beautiful, in the rude w cabin to which I  had conveyed you, after Bs having rescued yju from the grasp of brutal tic rlffians, I conceited a. feeling which swal- he   u lowed up every other--love is too-'poor a r- word to'express that feeling---it was adora y tion. Day by day it grew stronger, and at w length I dared to hope that my passion k might meet a response in your heart. The y hope was not vain, f r as time sped by our n intimacy grew more lose, and at length-- t- O, rapture!--I listened to the confession, n timidly given, that you loved me. Then it e seemed to mne that the world had suddenly n put on another aspect, the skies seemed I bluer, the stars brighter, and the flowers e more fragrant, and the birds more musical. n At length a cloud obscured the horizon of y my joy---malice was at work, and I feared that you had ceased to love me---this was n only momentary, for anon the glorious sun ig of truth shone forth and all was bright again ,- IfI loved you then, Eveleen, When you haO i no sorrow, how much greater must be m n love now, when you are rudely cast off b s an unfeeling relative, and overshadowed nD n grief?" - "Come love," said Mrs. Jackson, again d addressing her, " dry up your..tears--slebo )t with me to-night, and- henceforward I shall L regard you as my daughter," and taking her by the  hand. as she bade Haviland good r night, and led her to her sleeping apari- y ment. Two years passed by, during the whole of - which time  Eveleen remained under the - protection of the lady who had so generously u adopted her- as a daughter. Ifer uncle, when his anger had somewhat abated, felt d that he had acted rashy, the spirit of the t orphan girl's father was ever whispering in o his ear, charging him with having violated his solemn oath. In vain he sought for an P excuse in her disobedience, and argued with e himself that had she been his own daughter e he would have acted the same, and so he' I would, but then the "still small voice" pro- 'pounded the- question, "Would you have I acted properly . Even supposing, for the r sake of argument, that she had been your daughter, and was actually, as guilty as you supposed her to be, was it acting the part of a parent, when she had erred, to cast her off -to entrust heki to the care of strangers- instead of trying by persuasion and the force of love, to win her back to the paths ot duty and virtue?"  Stronger and stronger did the conviction grow in his mind that he had acted wrongly, nay wickedly, till the feeling at length became, an actual torment to him, and he would have given every cent of his possessions if he could have recalled the past. His son, too, hadgradually re- lapsed into his old habits, of dissipation and disobedience, and the Cfarmer Was more than once tortured by the suspicion that Eveleen was indeed innocent, and was the victim in some way, of Bernard's duplicity.. A dozen times did he resolve to address a letter- to her, begging her to forget the past, and' re ,?    , ' *  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7813-00000019"/> tm hbme again, but each time his pride kept him back' for she, although she had never neglected to inquire of the servants when she met them as to the state of his health. had never by word or look expressed a desire to converse with him. Such was the state of affairs when one morning William Haviland, who had for eighteen months devoted his time to the tudy of the law in, his native city, during which time he occasionally visited Eveleen, lLighted from his horse, at the widow's dwell- ing and imparted to that lady and Eveleen the melancholy intelligence of the death of his father,* who had for some time been his only remaining parent. - "El eleen," said he, as they sat side by side on the afternoon of the day of his re- turn, "I had hoped in a few days to call i you my wife, but the sad event of which I have informed you, will deprive me of that happiness for a few months. In the mean- 1 time, I Iiave business in Dublin which must i be attended to, and consequently we shall 1 not be much together. I shall keep you in- t formed of my  proceedings, however, and shall neglect no opportunity that offers to be c with you. I have one request to make be- t fore lagain leave you, dear Eveleen," he I continued; as he passed his arm, around her c waist, " which is, that during my absence, I you will remain beneath this roof, and not, on 'any account again place yourself beneath M your uncle's protection." .   "Why, William," exclaimed Eveleen, in fi a  tone of surprise, " what could have put d' such an idea in your head?"     p "I know not," he replied, "but some- sA thing tells me, he will endeavor to persuade qi youl to such a corse. I should not feel at ease if I thought you were there, for there sa is danger to you in the very atmosphere of ha the place. Here you are safe from insult if and injury, and here I want you to promise of myo, you will remain."        in "Well," said Eveleen, laughingly, "I caLrot see, the shadow of a reason why I th should wish to return there, but since you we desire it, I promise you that I will not visit pn my uncle's house, unless he is taken dan- raT gerously ill, and wishes to see me."  ' s   That's my own dear girl,' said Havi- sai land, as he fervently kissed her.  . the Haviland had but three days to spend not with Eveleen, previous to his depaoure for ass Dublin, whither he was bound to take coun- for. mebwith a band of patriots, regarding some dea secret movement which they had it in con- ] temptation to make. The story of his infi- ad 'delity to the Young Irelind party, which wit   ride had at first arrayed so many of the pea. had santry against him, was not for, a moment nts believed by the patriotic 0oung men with his whom he was banded, and the slander had ;sed in fact died of itself for want of evidences even with'those who had felt most bitter one towards him.           te for Late on the afternoon of the day %Which the Haviland had fixed upon for his departure, ing a party well known to our readers, consist- en, intg of Bernard WilsonA Pat P]anders, Bill ell- Stark, Thadeus Doyle and his son Tim, een started on the road to Dublin.

I e- thought to climb into the windy to see could heI steal anything, whin I sees himself and the er colleen sittin' wid their backs to me, and so e, I listened and heard him say it." * t, This was a long speech for a boy who th was in the habit of answering only in mono- syllables, and drawing a -long breath as he in finished it, he thrust his dirty digits into the it depths of his unfathomable pockets, and pressed his lips firmly together, as who - should say, "I wudn't answer another e question to save your life, so I wudn't." tt 1 I don't think he can escape us now," e said Bernard, addressing Pat Flanders,-"I f have. pistol, knife and poison with me, and t if wt cannot find an opportunity to use one e of them successfully before he reaches Dub. lin, the devil's in it." 1  "It's my opinion," answered Pat, " that the devil's in it iv ye do-for sure no Saint i would iver ingage in such a business, iv the praste do give thim gintlemev a true cha. racter."' "I must be off to America in a few days," said Bernard, without apparently noticing the remark of his companion, "' and I could not go with a  light heart if I had not the assurance that Bill Haviland was dead be- fore I started. D-n him! nothing but his death can balance accounts between us."  He grated his teeth fearfully as he spoke, atd -his whole countenance was lighted up with a look of the direst malignit.  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7813-00000020"/> CHAPTER VIII . TOAT all men have their failings, nobody 1 will deny. Thadeus Doyle had many, but i most of them, in the eyes of Bernard Wil- 1 son, were virtues. Doyle was looked upon! by Bernard as the most valuable man ii the i party, if he would keep sober. He was i shrewd, cunning, quick and daring, but it  was necessary to watch him closely, for if an opportunity offered, he was sure to drink 1 till his absence was rendered as necessary as his presence was deemed desirable when I he was sober. Such being the case, it was with no very amiable feeling that Bernard observed him drinking whisky from a flask which he pulled from his coat pocket. "Doyle," te said, as he snatched the flask, which he found was quite empty, from that individual's hand, " can't you keep sober for once in your life? We are on business now which requires nerve, and if you are to be one of the party, it is necessary that you . should be able to sit a horse, so that you may at least escape, if you are unable to do anything else. We do not wish to be caught, tried and condemned on the testi- mony of a Queen's witness." His rebtke came too late, for Thaddeus Doyle -was unquestionably already anything but sober, and by the time they reached the first public house on the road-a dilapidated hotel-bhe was decidedly drunk. Bernard, who wished him  heartily to the devil, thought the wisest plan would be to pull up at the hotel and,leave him there to sleep off the effects of the whisky which he had swallowed; so, after giving him instructions to remain there till the return of the party, which instructions were only answered by Doyle with; maudlin grins and hiccoughs'; they got him to bed, and proceeded on their route. Meanwhile, William Haviland, whose in- tention it had been to depart at six o'clock, found the society of his affianced bride en- tirely too agreeable for his power of resis- tance, and it was at least nine o'clock when he gave Eveleen the parting kiss, bade Mrs. Jackson farewell,jumped into the saddle, and started on a brisk trot for Dublin. The night threatened rain when Haviland - started, the sky was as black as ink,the at- mosphere damp and chilly, and the scene, contrasted with that which he had just left in the dwelling of the widow, seemed doubly dark and dismal. He had not progressed more than a couple of miles on his journey when the rain commenced falling, which gradually increased, and by the time he reached the house where Doyle had been pul to bed, the wina had increased to a perfecl gale, and the rain descended i -torrents. !"I almost regret," he. said, as he pulled up at the door, "that I did not wait until   morning before I commenced my journey. I should have done so, if I had not made up my mind to start to-night, but I do not like to alter my purpose when I have cnce settled upon a plan-of action." Thus saying, he en- tered the hotel, gave directions that his horse should be taken care of, and expressing his intention to wait till the storm had abated, he seated himself in front of a blazing turf fires and as the steam from his drenched garments enveloped him around, he indulged in thoughts of Eveleen and happiness. Arousing himself at length, he approached the door, looked out upon the night, and as the storm showed no signs of abating speedi- ly, he thought he would spend the time, while weather-bopnd, in drawing up some documents connected with his business. So, taking off his coat, he Spread it upon the back of a chair in front of the fire, and de- positing his hat upon a table, he asked the landlord if he could be accommoda/ed with pen, ink, and paper? The landlord, a stout, red-faced, jolly; honest-looking fellow, in- formed him that in an adjoining room he would find the materials -he required, ready to his hand. "It isn't an hour since," he said, " that a gintleman was" usin' thim, and I didn't disturb thim since," and leading the way, he inducted his guest into the apart- ment. "I v you want anything," he .dded, as he turned to leave Haviland, "all you have to do is to knock on that windy which looks out upos tiie yard, and one of us will be- with you in a minit. The rain is playin' the very divil wid the cellar-the mud is flowin' into it like a river; and I'm just afthez callin' in all hands to hilp me sthop it;- Good fnight, sir." "Good night," answered William Havi- land, and the landlord departed. In the meanwhile, Thaddeus Doyle, hav- ing- slept off the effects of the whisky, awoke, and as Haviland drew up at the door  of the hotel, he lav trying to collect his scat- , tered senses. "Where am I, anyhow ." he - said to himself, as he peered around lftO ooin, - and tried in vain to penetrate the darlness. I '"Whew!" he continued, as the rain, carried  by the force of the wind, came pattering d against the window panes, " how it rains! It is a blipsin' that I 'm under shelther, any- d ways-ha e I bin dhramein', or what?" and : again he paused in the endeavor to recall , what had passed. "Oh, now I remember," It he exclaimed, as the recollection of Bernard y and the rest of his companions came bick d to him, "I was bound on some expedishun y wid young Wilson an' the rest, an' becaee I h tuk a wee dhrop o' the craythur, they didn't e consider me sober enough to mnake wan o9 it the party, and so they left me in bed here. t I'm much obliged to him for that same con- descenshun, for I'd rather be here nor/out in d the rain. Conshumin' to me!" he continued il " bud me head sphins round like a whirlgig *    an' although the ground outside is afther hav- ia,plinty to dhrink, it's meself is sufferin' wid the drouth! I. mst git out o' this, an' see is there a naggin' o' whisky in the house." Rising cautiously from the bed upon which he had been flung by his companions with all his clothes on, he groped around in the dark till his hand came in contact with the knob of the door, which he slowly opened, and made his way noiselessly along the entry, and down stairs into the room which Havi- land had vacated. The domestics were all employed out-side, and as Tim gazed around the apartment, his eye fell upon a bottle which stood upon the mantle-piece, with a tumbler alongside of it. Approaching it, he seized it, smelt of it, and as a smile of satisfaction illumined his features, he poured out about half-a tumbler full of pure whisky, and imbibed it almost at a swallow. "Arrah, but that's the rale ould stuff!" he said, as he passed his hand back and forth in a satisfied manner, over his stomach ; "I'll sphake a good word for this landlord wherever I may go, for he not only kapes good whisky, but it's as free as wather, an' ye may have it without askin' for it. Be the rock iv Cashel!" he continued, as his eye fell upon Bernard's coat and hat, " iv he hasn't had the kindness to set out a gintle- man's coat an' hat for me!-and wud'nt it be imperlite for me to refuse to take them?" As he spoke, he threw aside his dilapidated head-piece, and investing himself in Havi- land's coat and hat, he surveyed himself in the glass, exalaiming, as he did so- "Thady Doyle, -ma bouchal;, who is this said you weren't intended for a gintlpnan? Och, your soul, bud it fits illega l! I must git out iv this though, for your giierous land- lords do sometimes alter their miinds, an' he might want to give the coat an' hat to some wan else i" and approaching the front door, he let himself out into the open air. It was still raining, and as Doyle gazed up at the murky sky, he exclaimed--- "I wohdher, now, iv I cudn't borry a horse from the landlord till I'd return frim Dublin!-sure, he woudn't expict a dacint gintleman to walk on, such a night as this, an' iv coorse I'd return the baste agin." He walked towards a shed adjoining the hotel, as he spoke, and uttered a grunt of satisfaction as he observed Haviland's horse quietly masticating the fodder that had been placed before him. "Well, well," he remarked, as he pro- ceeded to untie the animal, "I've no sooner to make a wish than it's gratified-whoa, my darlint!-stip aisy iv ye plase-I wud'nt bleak the repose o' the -ginteel folks within, all' they so obligin' an' kind to me, for the wide world-so-o-o, darling so-o-o!" and leading the horse carefully some distance from the house, he jumped into the saddle,   struck his heels into the animal's flanks, and dashed off at a full gallop. Bernard Wilson and his companions, after they had left Doyle, proceeded on their way, and at about the time Haviland took leave of Eveleen, they had reached a point upon the highway where the road was skirted on each side by a small piece of woods. Here *they halted, and dismounting, they led their horses a short distance into the woods, and returned again to deliberate upon their farther proceedings. "Curse this rain!" said Bernard impa- tiently, "I fear it may have caused him to alter his mind. If he started at six o'clock, he should have been here by this time ; but something may have detained him, and I will watch here till daylight, rather than he sha:ll escape me. Where is the cord?" said he, addressing Stark. "Here," said that individual, producing a coil of stout rope. Bernard fastened one end of it to a tree, and then crossing the road, he passed the. other end around a tree on the opposite side, and bade his companions stand ready to seize it. "It is almost too dark, at pre- sent," said he, " to distinguish a person at any great distance, but I have great hopes that it will clear up ere long. I think I shall be able to tell his horse at all events even in the darkness, for he is a plculiarly marked bald-faced chestnut, with four white feet, and a white spot oa his-left shoulder. In case any other traveler should come along all we have to do, is to let the rope remain slacked, and he will pass over it, but when I give the word, pull hard and hang on with all your strength. If I can manage to\bring him to the ground, I will forgive him ever afterwards if he escapes me." Everything having been thus satisfac- torily arranged, the murderers relapsed into silence and waited for their victim. Hour after hour passed by, during which the rain still continued to descend in torrents, and-no traveler made his appearance. The impa- tience of Bernard, who stood with his right hand inserted beneath his coat, grasping the stock of his pistol, the muzzle of which, to protect it from the rain, he had placed under his vest, close against his bosom, was fast becoming exhausted, and ever and anon, the low muttering. of Stark and Pat Flanders, showed that they were anything but pleased with the situation in which they were placed. The boy, Tim Doyle, wasabout the most contented of the party. He  sat doubled up at the foot of a tree, the water from the branches of which poured in a per- fect cataract upon hiin, apparently, sound asleep, and resting as tranquilly as though he was reclining Yupon feathers in a first- class hotel. At length the storm began to abate, the rain descended less heavily, the wind fell to a murmurs the ink-like cloude /  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7813-00000021"/> '  n teRCbreak away,. and in a short time thereafter the edge of the moon showed *ltal   the corner of a ponderous leaden -T-ht is clearing away at last," said Ber- i?-. '7^ nard, and there is some hope for us after all. Hist?" he exclaimed, in a suppressed voice, as the sound of a horse's hoofs in the distance fell upon his ear, " stand ready!" The eyes of Bernard Wilson gleamed like balls of fire, and his frame trembled with eagerness, as he approached closer to the edge of the road and strained his vision to catch the first glimpse of the traveler.-- "'Tis he!"-he hissed, as he sprang t the rope and took another turn around the tree, "now hold hard!" On came the horseman at full gallop, evi- dently blind to the danger ahead of him. The sagacious and clear sighted animal which he bestrode, however, had evidently observed the impediment just as he reached it, for he attempted to clear it, but the speed at which he was going rendered it impossi- ble, and striking it as he rose with, his fore feet, he stumbled and threw his rider far in advance of him. A  yell of fiendish exultation broke from the lips of Bernard Wilson, as rushing upon his prostrate victim, whlo lay stunned by the fall which he had received, he placed the muzzle of his pistol against his ear, and pulled the trigger. A flash, a report, and Thadeus Doyle, after a slight struggle, lay a corpse before the assassins. "Now,   Bill Haviland," said the mur- I derer, as he spurned the body with his foot, X "' the account between you and me, which has E been of rather long standing, is at length 1 closed.  Stop," he continued, as he pro- t ceeded to rifle the coat-pockets of the dead 1 man, "' you may have some documents here f that will be of use to me. As I am about m leaving Ireland, I don't know thatthere will p be any harm in making what I can at her g expense, before I go. Now boys, let us off p for Dublin as -fast as horseflesh will carry I us!!" he exclaimed, addressing his com- fa panions, and arousing the Mt Tim.   a William Haviland, having concluded his p writing, and noticing that the storm had u abated, arose, and proceeding to the room ii in which he had first seated himself, was w somewhat surprised to observe that his coat ic and hat had been riemoved, while those of n Thadeus Doyle were lying upon the floor. ha Thinking, however, that the landlord might th have taken them in charge, he rang a bell  which lay upon the table, and the landlord he soon after appearing, he stated his desire to hi proceed on his journey.        fu "Well," said Fie host, "iv you would sa take my advice, you would stop the night qu wid us. But if-ye be to go, God speed ye."*-of "Well," answered Haviland, who saw as, ;,0e landlord made-o-o movement to procure be   ne his missing habiliments, "where is 'my iit ed and coat'?" en 4"Your hat and coat, is it ." answered the landlord, as" his eye fell upon the suspickic r- looking garment that Doyle had. thrown off. er "The devil a wan o' me knows-where did ed you lave thim?" he  "Here, upon this chair," replied HRai. land. ke The landlord for a moment stood like ow th thunderstruck, and thenr suddenly left the. le room. Returning almost immediately afte. to wards, he said, with a rueful countenance- "I'm sorry, sir, bud a thafe o' the wor' l ie that was put to bed here, dhrunk, a few e, hours ago, has left, an' I'm afraid your things left wid him; but I can furnish you i- wid another coat and hat. and maybe iv you i. ride fast you can overtake him." al Haviland donned the articles which the y landlord brought him, and started out to d mount his horse, but what was his mortifi- d cation to find that it was also gone. De- i- termined; however, to pursue his way, he e obtained a horse from the landlord, mounted, n and started on. The moon by this time was shining brightly, and Haviland had not pro.. n ceeded far when he saw his own horse, n without a rider, making rapid strides towards e him. Dismounting quickly, he secured the e animal as he came up, and retracing his 1 steps, he restored the landlord's horse, and d proceeded by the aid of a light which tho T host produced, to examine his own. He was not long in discovering that the horse - had been thrown heavily, for he was full of , mud, and after standing still awhile, went s slightly lame on attempting to step. Havi. Iland did not consider him in fit condition to - travel, and, placing -him in the care of the I landlord, he remounted the horse he had be- fore borrowed, and was soon again upon his way. He rode briskly, and as he ap- proached the spot where the dreadful tra- gedy which we have already narrated, took place, he was startled at seeing the body (of Doyle stretched at full length upon the road, face down. Pulling up under a tree, lie alighted, and fastening his horse, he ap. proached the body, and turning it over, he was horrified at perceiving that it had lain in a  pool of- blood, and that his own hands were besmeared with human gore. The idea suddebly occurred to him that the dead man might have been the individual who. had made free with his property, and with this idea occurred the recolle itibn that he had left in his coat pocket documtnents which he would not have made public even to save his own life. Examining the body care. fully by the light of the moon, he became. satisfied that he had conjectured rightly, and quickly thrusting his hand into the pockets of the coat, his heart sank within him as he ascertained the fearfu truth that they had been rifled.   ar a moment Raviland was fairly para- lysed with the fears which overwhelmed him. "Fool that I am!" he exclaimed, "why did I not use more care?" Then pausing for a moment, as if in deep thought, ,he added: " but this circumstance should urge rme to reach Dublin with all haste, or worse may come of it. Poor fellow!" he said, as he looked at the dead body of Doyle, "your career of crime has suddenly been cut short; but your last offence has undoubt- edly saved my life, for the villains who mur- dered you were lying in wait for me, or the papers would not have been missing."' Thus saying, with a heavy sigh he jpmped into the saddle, and resumed his way at'a full gallop. As he approached the townof Naas, where the assizes of Kildare county are held, the -first rays of the morning sun began to show themselves above the tops of the hills in the distance, and Haviland was somewhat per- plexed,- as to what course ke should pursue, ;rUnder other circumstances he would not have hesitated to stop and make the author- Cities acquainted with what he had seen, but he feared that should he do so, he would be forfed to remain as a witness in the case, andtin that event, the most unfortunate re- sults might ensue. It was actually neces- sary that he should make certain parties aware of the loss of his papers without de- lay, and after much deliberation he deter- mined to keep right 9n, and return, if possible, .from Dublin, in time to be present at the inquest. Arriving at the capital, Haviland pulled up at a hotel, and giving his horse into the hands of an hostler, lie desired to be shown to a room. After bathing freely he fordered and drank a cup of strong coffee, then throwing himself upon a bed, he was boon sleeping soundly. It was nearly noon when he awoke, and rising with alacrity, he sallied forth and directed his step setowards Prince's Street. He stopped opposite the Post Office, and entered the residence of a certain doctor, well known as an ardent pa- triot and eloquent pleader in the cause of Ireland. Into this gentleman's hands he delivered the papers which he had written an the previous evening, and also made him acquainted with the loss of his documents. Having thus far relieved his mind, he, re- urned to his hotel, and shortly afterwards, again started towards Naas, to be present at the inquest upon the body of Doyle. I must now again conduct the reader to the baek-room of the liquor shop on the Dublin quays, where, it will be recollected, the conversation relative to the robbing of Mr. Wilaon's house, took place between Bernard Wilson, Pat Flanders, and Bild Stark. The same three desperate men were again assembled ; there on the night following the murder of Doyle, together with the boy Tim, who sat in a cvrner, with \   - his elbows bent and his head resting upoa 1 his hands, eagerly 4" devouring up- the dis- , course" of the party, but keeping perfectly a mute himself. ;, "Do vou hear anything said of the mu , l der?" asked Bernard, addressing Pat Flaa- r ders. "Plinty," answered that individual-sure, , iverybody's talking about it." "Have you heard what the verdict was?" inquired Bernard, tremblingly. * "Yis," answered Pat--" the verdict is, 3 that he met his death from a pistol shot in the hands oft somel person or persons un- , known, an' if mesilf had been one o' the I Jury, I should insisted on addin' to it the sintince--' served him right.'" "Did anybody recognize the body ." asked ' Bernard.. "I don't know that' anybody knew him by name," answered Pat, " for I didn't hear any name mentioned; but, it sthruck me as very singular that he should be known at the as- ;sizes. I heard a number sayin' that thJ officers knew him well, and be me sowl, I ; always thought that Willy Haviland was the very pink of honesty." "O, it isn't at all likely they knew him as a thief," answered Bernard--'Bill, Haviland has been preparing himself for the practice of law, and he mav have been hanging around the Court House at Naas for what I know. His legal knowledge, however, will not avail him much now, unless there is a criminal court in hell, at which the devil presides as Judge ;" and as he uttered this profane speech, the ruffian laughed demoi.' acally--"But now to business," he continued, as he pulled forth the document which he had taken from the pocket of Haviland; "there is enough in this paper to consign a number-of my deceased enemy's most particu- lar friends to a dungeon, on a charge. of high treason. There will be satisfaction enough to me in injuring anybody that worked with him, even though I make nothing by it in a pecuniary point of view.  I shall proceed alone in this business, and H want you to6 wait here till I return. I shall not be long absent, for it will take but a short time to complete the job. My first step must be to, consult Col. Brown, the Clhief Commissioner of Metropolitan Police. I shall very likely find him at his office, at the Lower Castle yard." "If you take my advice," interrupted Pat, "you'll have nothing to do wid the Potice a long'as you can avoid it. It's lookin' afther you they'll be, won o' these days, instead o' your lookin' afther them. The very name o' police gives me a disagreeable sinsatioca ,around the throat, an' I'd be obliged to you, if you wudn't mintion -it." "You are one of that class,+ said Bernard, as he surveyed Pat contemptuously, * who are reckless enough to get into difficult, a d  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7813-00000022"/> towardly enough to betray yourself after- wards. Don't you see, you stupid fool, that the fact of my being, bold enough to con- sult the authorities would be in my favor in case suspicion should point towards us? I tell you I shall move in this matter, just as though nothing in the murder line had oc- curred. A set of young men-patriots they call themselves--wlio take exceptions to the manner in which her Most Gracious Majes- ty's government is administered, meet to- night at 9 o'clock, at the Brazen Head Ho- tel, to discuss some matters detrimental to the public peace. Now- I feel it incumbent ot me, as an order-loving citizen and a loyal British oabject, to inform Her Majesty's ser- vants of this fact, to the end that an example may be made of these most rebellious kpaves.% Shau e upon you, Pat, to -counsel me against a course in every way so praise- worthy!" and indulging in a hearty laugh at what he considered a piece of .most refined facetiee, Bernard strode out of the apartment and took his way towards the Lower Castle yard. It was not his intention to deliver up the document in his possession to the officer with whom  he was about seeking an interview. Far from it. He was fearful that her Ma- jesty's servant should be curious enough'to wiah to know where he obtained it, a close is vestigation of which matter might lead to rery disagreeable consequences. His inten- tion was merely to state that he, had sus- picions, from a conversation which he had overheard, that a meeting was to take place, and that although he-might be entirely mis- taken, yet in such troublous times he felt it incumbent on him as a good subject, to men- t tiQn his fears. He found the Chief Commissioner at his C post, and in a very few words stated the 1 object of his visit.  "It is slight grounds. to proceed upon," ; said Col. Brown, "arn yet it is worthy of a some attention."           t ' As you say," remar!ned Bernard, " the C grounds are very slight, and you may have a you'r trouble for your pains; and then again, E you may make some important arrests." "I will try it, at all events," answered the p officer, and 'taking a posse of trusty men v with him, started in, the direction of the sus- u  gceted house. The Brazen Head Hotel, an n -old and somewhat dilapidated building, situ- li ated in a sort of court surrounded by ware- b tinoues, on Lower Bridge-street, Dublin, is n well Known as having been a place of ren- ru dezvous for the patriots of '98. MAany a time tl and v 11 has the lamented Emmett harangued 1is ftiends assemnbled there in secret con. re dave, and it has ever been the head-quarters u of the true friends of Irelaind. It is almost at needless to say that on the present occasion the Chief Commissioner and his aids accom-. of   r- pfished about as much as the celebrated! Kh It of France, who 1-       "With fifty thousand men, n Marched up the hill, and then marched down again," I for the reader will have already divined that s the information which Haviland had given  the Doctor, with whom he had an interview y on the morning of the murder, was sufficient e to prevent any assemblage. Bernard knew not what to make of the - circumstance. He thought he must-have- - made some mistake in the date while reading o the document, and after Col. Brown and his t party had departed, and there was nobody L1 present but himself, the landlady, and a gen- - tleman who was seated ata round table, en-. e gaged in reading the Freeman's Journal, s which he held in such a position as to hide 1 his face, the murderer likewise took a seat at the table, and pulling forth the stolen man- t uscript, proceeded to re-peruse its contents. 1 Scarcely had he got it unfolded, however, t when a strong hand tore it from his grasp, e and William Haviland, springing across the table, and clutching him by the throat, hissed min his ear, loud enough- for himself alone to hear- 'Bernard Wilson, I arrest you on the charge of MURDER!" CHAPTERIX. (CHAPTER IX. FOR a moment Bernard Wilson shook as though attacked by an 'ague fit. He had  supposed, of course, that Haviland was dead, and hardened and reckless though he was, the sudden appearance of his enemy before him, filled him with a superstitious awe-that caused his hair to stand on end, and his blood to curdle in his veins. He was soon aware, however, from the tight pressure upon his windpipe, that he was grappled by real flesh and blood, and not a phantom. Exerting all his strength, therefore, he broke from the grasp of Haviland, and made for the street. Quick as a flash, however, Haviland was again upon him, and bearing him to the ground, lie exclaimed-- "Nay, nay, fiend, murderer, villain, we part not so-the time has at length arrived when an understanding must be had between us -for years you have followed not' only myself, but one who is dearer to' me' than' life, with all the devilish pertinacity of a blood-hound. You have had your day-- now it is my turn ; and before many months roll by you shall expiate your crimes upon the galltows." By this time Bernard had, in a manner, recovered his self-possession, and casting/ upon Haviland a look of mingled malignity and fear, he said, in a suppressed voice-- "Perhaps it will be more to the advantage of William Hlaviland to converse diaspassio   *ly!y-I do not think he relishes the idea of dangling from a gibbet any more than I do; and high trdason, I believe, is punishable with death--besides, what becomes of the cause of Ireland if I swing? 'You must not lose sight of the fact that although ybu have regained your document, I have -names and facts." This was true, and Haviland's features assumed a disappointed and bitter expression as he removed his grasp from the villain, and allowed him to take a seat, while the land- - lady, who, up to this time, had gazed upon the strange scene before her with a look of surprise and disquietude, went towards the door, as though for the purpose of calling as- sistance in case of necessity. Her inten- tioin was anticipated by Haviland, who -ap- proaching her, whispered in her ear that there was no danger, and then returned, and seated himself by the side of Beiard, who by this time, had regained his composure, and with all air of the most perfect indiffer- ence, remarked- "I thought you would rather compromise the matter, and I coommend you for it. There I is nothing like a spirit of accommodation I when one finds oneself in a disagreeable fix. J Sit down, my friend, sit down, and let 'is I talk this disagreeable little affair over calml- o ly."                  t "Your patron, the devil," said Haviland, f as he seated himself, " at present favors you, r but retribution must come sooner o6r later. 1; Had you given up that document to -the t authorities, nothing upon earth could have a saved you from the gallows. As it is, your t; career of crime may continue {for a time s lorr, but life, to such a than as you, must e be a  iurden." . '"It is a burden which I shall bear with n all the patience of a martyr," answered Ber- sj nard, with a scowl, " if I can at any time ni during its continuance have the satisfaction en of stopping your breath effectually." n "Inhuman monster!" exclaimed Haviland, te "why do you seek my life "? " "V-1or the best of reasons," was the de- in liberate answer-"I  hate you-hlate you in beyond the power of expression. You have w crossed my path a  number of times-have thwared-my plans-have. taken sides against fe me always-and worst of all, I have well- nigh. suffereSd death from a blow at your ca hands. Look there!" and holding down his m kad, he parted the hair which covered the w; tignitful scar left by the wound which Havi- ha land's blackthorn stick had niade.. "' Bill Haviland," he continued, " among my other a defects, may have given me the character of po a  hypocrite--you'shall not call me one, at th: least, for I will be open with you. I hate in you- bitterly, cordially, with my whole the heart and soul I  hate you, Ad I will' not a'n rest till I see you before me a stiffened I E corpse f"               m:   of "Bernard Wilson,'" said Haviland, regarid. o; ing him sternly, "I haveSever interfered le with you except when I had right on my he side.. You brought death arid sorrow into ot one happy home. I saw the aged, silver. ve haired sire bend in an agony of grief ovet nd the dead body of an only daughter, who, rendered frantic by your perfidy, to escape es the scorn and contumely of an unfeeling an world, laid violent hands upon herself. Had id she been my sister, not all the combined d- powers of the earth could have saved your ,n life; I would have followed you to the world's. ,f end, ere you should have escaped my ven- ie geance; as it was, I could only feel sympa- 3- thy fobr the bereaved parent, and detestation i- for the wretch who- had wrought his misery. - Not long afterwards, I was informed' that. it your hellish arts were at work in another d direction, and then I interfered and foiled o you, and saved from  irretrievable ruin a A, young and inexperienced girl- Burning - with rage, and not having manhood enough to attack me openly, you sought to wreak e veilgeance upon your Intended victim's bro. 3 ther, whose only fault was a too pacific dis. n position. I espoused his quarrel, and you,  like a sneaking, despicable cur, fled from my s presence, atiaid to look me in the face. For a while I lost sight of you while engaged in the dastardly attempt to abdut--no doubt , for the purpose of murdering-a young, in- , nocent, and lovely girl-one; moreover, re- lated to you by the ties of blood." I did not then know you, but Istruck you to the earth as I would a mad dog, and rescued the vie- tin of vour brutality, with whom I fled in safety.  Since that time you have tried in every way possible to deprive me not only of lifeb, but of what is far more precious to me, her love. In every attempt you have signally failed, and you sit quailing beneath my glance now, an example of the very low- est degree of degradation to which God's noblest work can be brought--a mean, con- temptible, heartless wretch-a human being only in form-a  beast in everything else- in short, a convicted, blood thirsty murderer, in comparison with whomrflhe first-born Cain was a very pattern of gentleness!" The face of Bernard Wilson glowed with ferocity as-he .answered: "Ohmrail on, and be d-d  to you! You can do so now with impunity, but it will be my turn next, and you shall pay for every word of the grandiloquent speech which you have just uttered, with a groan of torture!" "Pitiful coward!" answered Haviland, in a  tone of the deepest disgust. " do you sup- pose for a  single momenit that 'lheed your threats  It you have a spark of manhood in you, why do you not, instead of playing the midnight assassin, come boldly forward a'nd challenge me to combat on fair terms. I  shouild feel myself disgraced -by bringing myself' down to your level,'bu't I would do *^f   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7813-00000023"/> -ft, if only or the opportunity of ridding the world of a pestto society." "I dare say such an arrangement would be very agreeable to you," said Bernard, with an affected laugh, " but I am not in the habit of throwing away the game when I hold it in my own hands. Besides, I do not wish to kill you now; I have altered my -mind, and within the last ten minutes have determined to devise some other means to- make you comfortable." "Let, me advise you, then," said Havi- land, as Bernard arose to depart, "to use great care in laying your plans, for by all that is most sacred, I swear that the next hostile demonstration on your part towards me, will be your last, if it is in my power to compass your destruction!o ' "Your advice p entirely gratuitous," an- swered Bernard with &amp; sneer, "you may rest assured that I will not lack for caution in my operations. Good night, and pleasant dreams to you!" and; as he was about leav- ing the hotel, he with mock politeness, raised his hat gently from his head, and bowed obsequiously. ' "There goes the worst man in Ireland," said Haviland to the landlady, as Bernard disappeared, slamming the door after him. "Keep watch of him, Mrs. D., for he is no friend to our cause," and taking a light, he retired for the night, and was soon enjoying that sweet repose which the man who had just left him could never know. Bernard Wilson, once more in the street bent his steps towards the hovel on the quays in, which he had left his vile compa- nions. It was a foggy, disagreeable night, and as he walked moodily along, he search- ed in his depraved mind for some idea that might put him in the way of revenge, but could not seem to hit upon any which -suited him. "Never mind," he muttered, " there's no very great hurry, it will come by and bye--perhaps the bright imaginations of Stark or Flanders may assist me; well, well, we shall see ;" and again he was silent, for ais mind reverted to the murder, and al- though brutal in the extreme, yet he shud- dered at the idea of having murdered an in- dividual in cold blood, without the slightest cause. "Who the devil could it have been?" he pandered; "he rode Iaviland's horse and wore Haviland's clothes, that's certain; the- document which 1 took from the coat puts'that beyond a doubt. Pat said the police were acquainted with him; then it must have been a thief, who in some man- ner had managed. to rob Haviland of his pro- perty and me of my victim at the same time. Psha! no matter who it was. It was only a man gone, anyhow, and the world can spare him." As he came to this very cha- ritable conclusion he quickened his pace, for notwithstanding he tried to argue himself into a tranquil frame of mind, the effort was ,.   abortive, and -the dingyr, solita street be. came almost frightful to him. -e imagined that he could see the murdered man, gaunt, stark, and frightful, in the gloomy porch of every door-Way that he passed, and when he ventured by a court or alley-way, it was with a rush, as though he feared some un. seen enemy would dart out and pounce upon him. Every object that could possibly be tortured -by his guilty mind into the shape of a man. seemed instinct with life and-ready to rush upon him; and once, with hair erect through tfear, he, with desperate resolve, brought himself up in front of what he con- ceived to be a tantastic figure with arms stretched out to clutch him, and bade it "come on." Reassured from the fact that it did not approach him; he advanced toward it and found that it was a wheelbarrow stand- ing erect with a cloth thrown over the han- dles of '; then lie cursed himself for giving way to his fears and started on again, again to be frightened by something equally absurd. At length he commenced to run, and in this manner, with his heart beating quickly and the perspiration starting from every pore, he  reached the hovel for which he was bound, and thundered at the door for admittance. i' Who is there V' said a not unmusical female voice. "It is me, Nelly," answered Bernand-- "mn:-Wilson!" "Well, what in the devil's name is the matter with you?" was the angry inquiry, as the door was opened, and a slight built Eng- lish woman about twenty-three years of age stood before him, "do' you want to alarm the whole neighborhood, and have the police down upon us." "No, no, Nelly," he replied, "but I was a little flurried, and wanted to get in as soon as possible---are the boys in the back room V" !"yes," said the woman testily, as she double-bolted, locked, and barred the door. , I've just let Pat Flanders in---he went out r almost directly after you did, and he has just returned with his skin pretty full of * somebody else's liquor than our's." Bernard made his way to the apartment t where a few hours before he had left bis a companions. He found the door open, and on looking in, a curious scene presented s itself. Bill Stark sat with his head resting i upon a table, an empty mug, and an un- I filled pipe before him, and fast asleep--the i boy Tim, as usual, was coiled up in a cor- - ner, hbt wide awake, his great eyes staring - like those of an owl,'as he gazed about the  roomi while Pat Flanders, who had evideqt- y ly just entered, for he lad not thrown off n his cap yet, sat facing the boy, with hif "back towards the door. "r  So you didn't know that ver father was f dead ."' said Pat, addressing the boy. s  The hoy shook his head- negatively   E"O, yis,' said Pat, " he tuk a piU whice didn't agree wid him. He "didn't want to take it, but the docther insisted upon it, and so it kilt him. O, yis, he's -dead, an, yer an orfin." "A ftat?" inquired the boy, into whose obumse head an idea that something of in- terest to himself had happened--he knew not what---began to find its way. "An orfin," said Pat, "which means a gossoon whose father and mother's gone out o'town, an' whose uncle is thransported for shape-stealin'. Och, my poor boy.- an' havn't ye a right to feel sorry, whin yer af-  ther losin' such a tendher parent as he was, an' wan that cud dhrink so- much whisky ." And Pat indulged in a boisterous fit of laugh- ter, which lasted till the tears ran down his cheeks in a perfect stream. "Oh, Thady Doyle, Thady Doyle," he continued, when his mirth had in some degree subsided, " it's $eself that hopes yer sowl's in glory this very minit, bud I doubt it damnably," and again he laughed. "Is me pappy dead?" inquired the boy, his dull eye lighting up with an expression of pleasure. "He: is," answered Pat. "An' lie can't conme back any more to bate me ." said the, boy, who, by this'time, in his excitement had risen to his feet. "The divil a come," answered Pat. "An' I can kape all I stale meself ." said the boy, now fairly beside himself with ex- citement. "The divil so much as a tinpinny nail can anybody take frim you now," said Pat, seemingly highly gratified at the manifes- tations of pleasure exhibited by the boy. "Whoop!" shouted the boy, in reaf Tip- perary fashion, as he tumbled' head over heels upon the floor, a half-pint pewter mug, a small wine-glass, and a brass door-knob, which he had stolen before Pat came in, rolling out of his pocket'upon the floor as he did so. "'Now  d'yer see that!" exclaimed Pat, deprecatingly--" sure yer afther stalin' frim yer frinds, which you musn't do, for ther's honor among thieves, you know."  The boy made no answer, but straighting himself up, he pointed towards the door, over Pat's head, and then slunk quietly into his corner again. Pat turned around, and 'his eyes met those of Bernard Wilson, who stood looking in upon him. "Ah, masther Wilson!" he exclaimed, "how is ivery bit o'.ye I O, come in an' take a seat till I tell yer the news." "Well, what is the news ." said Bernard, sulkily, as he threw himself into a chair. , D'yer mind Thady Doyle?" said Pat. "Yes, yes," answered Bernard impa- tiently, i' d---n him for a drunken beast." "Well, thin," answered Pat, " divil a sooorer man is there fi her Majisty's dowain-   h ions at this blissed moment than that same o Thady Doyle. Sure he didn't dhrink'a d dhrop since -the blissed night that we put n him to bed dhrunk, an' it's me own opinion that he niver will agin." e  "Well, well," said Bernard, " let's t ave - no more useless talk about the matter, I r heard you tell the boy that 1a* father was dead. Was you lying, or is it really soI i and if so, what caused his death?"  t "It was a pill caused hit death-a leaden r pill-which yersilf administered, for the divil ' a wan else was it but Thady Doyle that ye shot on the road." , "Well, I'm glad I've found it out," an- swered Bernard, " for I ascertained to-night that it was not Bill Haviland, and it has caused- me some little anxiety of mind-but now  let us drop the subject, and talk of something else. Stark," he cried, raising his voice, and shaking that individual,"wakce up, arouse yourself!. ' "Well, what's the matter now?" said the besotted wretch, raising his hid, and sha- king himself and gazing stupidly around. "I-have  seen Haviland t-night," said Bernard.  "The devil you have," said Stark, who awoke at once at this announcement, " why I,thought he was resting quietly, by this time, where he'd never disturb any one again." "' I thought so, too," answered Bernard, "but it turns out that such is not the case, for I saw and talked with him to-night, and Pat has found out that instead of him it was Doyle that I shot." At this part of the conversation, Bernard discovered the boy Tim, who had crept from- his position in the corner undert the table, and was endeavoring to make his escape through the still open door. Seizing him by the neck, he exclaimed-- "How now, you young hell-hound,where the devil are you going r' - "It's goin' home I am!" exclaimed the boy, " the way I 'can get all the things poppy left there, iv. I don't take thimn resilf, sure Peter Flannigan will be afther gettin thiim." "Stay where-you are," said Bernard, as he pushed .the boy .roughly back into his corner; "and hark ye, if' you attempt to leave here without our knowledge we'llsend you to keep your poppy, as you call him, company." "' Shure that's not the May to shpake to the boy iv you want to'kape him here," said Pat Flanders. t"You must stay wid us, Timmy," he said, addressing the boy; *" it wudn't do to let you go back, for you might say something, you know, that wud lead the people to think that we killed your father, an thin they'd put us in the prison, you know." "I thought to kill him wanst mesilf,"said the dutiful boy, " but I was afeard to try  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7813-00000024"/> wid the axe while he was ashape for fear I wudn't hit him hard enough, an thin I knew he'd kill me." "That's'a good gossoon," said Flanders, patting him approvingly on the head, " iv you grow up that way it's a beautiful mim- her of society you'll make wan o' these days, bud at prisent,-you know, you must stay wid us, the way you may have a chance to steal watches and jewelry, and fine things iv ivery sort; an whin ye git plenty o' thim here, we'll take ye across the big say, over into Ameriky, where you can spind yer money, and live like a gintleman. Wont that be the fun. now, Timmy ." The boy's eyes looked as big as saucers, and rolled about in his head extatically. "Can I have all that I stale meself ." he inquired. "To be sure you can," answered Ber- nard, " and more too, iv. you want it." - "The divil ca more I'll want," said the boy, who already, in imagination, was loaded down with riches. "Bud you must stay here, Timmy," said Pat, "for iv ye attempt to lave us, we'll have to tie your hands and feet. the way ye can't run off-d'ye mind?" - I do," said Timmy, who again crawled to his corner, apparently well satisfied, and settled down into his usual dumb-like de- nmeanor. "Yes," said Bernard, going back to the subject of which he was talking, "I not only saw and talked with Bill Haviland to-night, but Ifelt him too, as the marks of his nails upon my throat will testify. D-n him, I shall die of spleen if I do not find some means to wreak my .vengeance upon him, and I -vant you wth to set your wits to work and see if you cannot aid me..

'I would not convict him of treason, if I could, for that would -be considered honorable by some.. If I can once help him to a passage to Australia on a criminal conviction, I'll see to it that his charming sweetheart does not rest easy afterwards. I can do-nothing with her while he is at large, for he watches her too closely. Now let's see-How can we ac- complish it a" The three conspirators relapsed into si- itfnce, and each for about ten minutes seemed buried in thought "Pat Flanders was the first to break the silence, "I've thought of a plan," he said, "which 1 think wil. do iv we can get Nell to help   "What is it?" inquired Bernard eagerly "Why wouldn't it be an aisy thing," sawi  Flanders, " for Timmy here to dog masther Haviland, an' -find out some time, whin he will be walkin' in the street, at night 4--an' thin wudn't it be aisy for a nice lookin' young woman to faint away on the pavement jist as he was passin'?

D'ye see, now." continued Pat, as he rubbed his hands glee- fully, "sure there's groundwork for ye,.an' iv yourself can't fill it up, your fast friend, the divil, has deserted ye." "Pie Corner," said Bernard, " is rather a suspicious locality -" wouldn't he be apt to suspect something . I know he has vexy little knowledge of the ' fast' population of- Dublin, but then he's very shrewd,.and as Hamlet has it, 'can tell a hawk from a hernshaw.' Wouldn't it be better if we could introduce him into some more respect- able establishment, on the south side of the Liffey-- say French-street, or Clarendon- street-the Duchess's, for instance; suppose we introduce him to the Duchess of Cla- rendon ." "Introduce him to the divil!" exclaim- ed Pat, holding up his hands in perfect astonishment, "Masther Wilson, it's mesilf that thought you wor sharper noreat! Who the divil iver dhrames iv murtherin or robbin' any wan at the house of the Duchess1 Sure the jintleman that go there are in the habit o' payin' liberally enuf iv their own accord widout havin' anythin' tuk from thim be force!"  "That's very true," was the reply of Bernard, "I didn't think of that-well;.let it be Pie Corner, then. I've no doubt we shall be able to trap him, even there, if Nell enters into the business heartily-for I do believe she could deceive the devil himself if she set to work about it, much less a softs hearted-green-horn like Bill Haviland. So let's about it." And rising from his seat, h went to the door and called, in a low voies -"Nelly! Nelly Blossom!" "Ccming!" was the response, and shortly after, the woman who had admitted Wiloe made her appearance.   -CHAPTER X. Tir deliberation of the Coroner's Jury at the inquest upon the body of Doyle was of short duration. He was known by the police as a desperate and expert thief all over the south of Ireland, and consequently the persons who were called to view his body were not long in coming to the con- clusion that he was shot by some gentleman whom he was attempting to rob upon the Queen's highway, and that said gentleman, being in a hurry, had not thought it worth while to delay his journey for the purpose of testifying at,the inquest. Such being their conviction, they as I have already said, were not long in bringing in their verdict, the substance of Which our friend Pat Flan- ders, has already made the reader acquainted with, and by the time William Haviland re- turned to testify, the murdered man's body had been put beneath the ground, and he was allowed without detention, to take his way back again. In the meantime, the news that a man, whose dress corresponded with that of Wil- liam Haviland, had been murdered ofn' the road to Dublin, flew on the wings of the wind to Kildare, and was not long in reach- ing the ears of Eveleen, who, ever fearful for her lover's safety when he was absent, at once concluded the worst, and in a frame of mind bordering upon insanity, she rushed to the cabin of Biddy Ryan, who was the gen- eral gossip of the place, to see if she could not extract a ray of hope from any intelli- gence the old woman might have received. She was doomed to disappointment, however -Biddy had only learned what she herself had heard-that a man dressed like Haviland had been found dead on the road, his skull literally blown to pieces fromn a pistol shot. The old woman tried to speak consolation to the maiden, but -in truth she whispered hopes that she herself did not cherish, for she was of the opinion that the body found : was Haviland's. She knew that Bernard Wilson had not been home for some days, , and this disposed her to think that he had waylaid and murdered the young patriot. Unable to find any balm here for her crushed heart, Eveleen returned again to the house and flew to the widow's apartment. "O, mother," she exclaimed, for she had learned to call Mrs. Jackson by that tender name-" they have murdered him! Cruelly, brutally murdered him, and now I am indeed alone! I am alive, and yet I have no lit'e, for my heart is in his grave--I am on the earth, and yet I belong not to the world, for they destroyed my'world, when they took him from me!" And-here the poor girl covered her face *rith her hands, and indulged in paroxysms 'f grief terrible-to behold   ' Take comfort, my daughter," said the kind widow, affectionately embracing her, but at the same time overwhelmed with grief he-self--"Nothing is more likely than that he may at this moment be safe and well. Surely there were other travellers than him- self upon the road, and it is wrong to in- ulge in this immoderate grief upon Were Surmise." "Oh, Eveleen, Eveleen," cried the young girl, apostrophising herself. "'where now are the bright dreams in whicn you have so lately indulged? Where is the kind smile that was wont to greet you; the warm heart in which you was enshrined as an idol, and the dear voice that called you 'darling'! Gone, gone forever! settled in the night of the grave! lost! lost! lost!, The day-star of my existence has gone d6wn-the light of my soul has departed, and my heart is breaking " "Do not take on so, my dear child," said the widow, tremulously, the tears at the same time filling her eyes and streaming down her cheeks, "your great grief will' , render you insane, i" you do not chide it." Y; Yes," said Eve een, starting up quick ly, and looking wildey about, "I am insane, fbr I see before me -Sw in imagination a  countenance which would drive the Arch I Enemy of mankind himself to distraction! That face is Bernard'Wilson's! Does he expect to escape me!, When he raised his I hand against nmy life, I looked over it, for h was my uncle's son--but now, he has slain I my love, and by that act he has destroyed all that was kindly in my nature, and were he my uncle's self, he should die! You look at me, mother, as thouh you listened to he voice of one who spoke at random, an knows not what she says. Such is not Ith case-I know what I am speaking of,  and I tell you le shall die! If he be above i the earth, I will find him and atrag him to d justice, and if the law fail to accomplish his- r death, I will kill him rmyself. I can do it. i I, who yesterday, c(uld not have found it in d my heart to hurt a fly, could now stand by , and see that fiend torn piecemeal, for I have d no heart-it is in the grave with William!  To Dublin! to Dublin!" she exclaimed wild- 1 ly, as she rushed towards the door. e  "Merciful Heaven, assist me!" exclaim- ed the widow, in an agonized tone, as she i pursued and detained the distracted girl. r Her prayer, as if by a miracle, was an- , swered at once, for a knock at the door was d immediately followed by the announcement , that the postman had a letter for Eveleen e Wilson. With a loud cry Eveleen tore her- r self from the embrace of Mrs. Jackson, "rushed t) the door, snatched the letter eagerly from the hand of the postman, and e when she saw that the superscription was s in Haviland's handwriting, the reaction that at once took place in her feelings was *tiSgl* o  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7813-00000025"/> fui to witness. She wept and laughed hys- terically by turns, and at length entirely overcome by her contending emotions, she swooned dead away, and would have fallen to the floor, had the widow not received her in her arms. When she was restored to consciousness she was as weak as an infant, and it was some time before she was suffi- ciently collected to peruse the epistle, which, with a, convulsive clutch--as though fearful it would escape from her grasp, and leave her again in blank despair--she still kept possession of. Breaking the seal at length, she read as follows: "MY DEAR, DEAR EVELEEN:-I snatch a moment from pressing business to inform you that I have arrived safely in Dublin. I take this, the earliest opportunity, to do so, because a circumstance of a rather unpleas- ant nature occurred on the road on the night i left you.  A man was found murdered, who had my clothes on, and I feared should the story reach you, you would imagine that I was the victim. Tile truth of the matter is, that the murdered man was taken for me. He fell a victim to his own cupidity in stealing my coat, hat and horse. I know this tot: be the case, because certain docu- e ments were taken from  the pocket of the , coat, which, by a fiost fortunate circum- t stance, I am again in possession of. You l need no, be under the slightest apprehen- v tion for my safety, now, dearest, for I am c among friends, and for your sake. if I had c no other motive, I should be careful. I can- a not help shuddering when I think how far. a row has been my escape-not because I fear p death, but because the idea of parting with N you is ten thousand times more terrible than a the aspect of the Dread King, come he in I what shape he may, If deprived of you, is dear Eveleen, I  would not value life a straw, n but when you are near me, life is indeed lt precious, for the world seems full of. har- w mony and beauty, and everything speaks to m me of Eveleen.

It is a truth which I dare scarce- he ly breathe to myself, but in addressing you, no1 it is to my second self I whisper it, and I go know that in your bosom it is hermetically '01 sealed. I  must now take my leave of you pai for the present, darling. Write soon and ant make me acquainted with all your hopes and her fears, and every' feeling of your heart, for tIo there is to me a  joy too deep for utterance, her *rea in gazing upon'tho lines which your to    hys- dear hand hae penned. Farewell, desre rely and while this heart is capable of emotion, she believe me dllen     Your ever devoted WILLIAM." her I to Eveleen's young heart overflowed with ant, joy and gratitude to Heaven, when she had iffi- finished the perusal of her lover's hastily ich, written epistle, and she at once set about the . rfiul pleasant task of answering it. She wrote ave to Haviland, informing him of the torture ept she had undergone at the thought of his ;th, murder, and called upon him by all the love he bore her to be vigilant. Sie told him that every night and morning, she prayed h a to'-Heaven for his safety and success, rm and that sleeping or waking he was ever I in her mind.  Then she indulged in anti. so, cipations of the blissful future, and dwelt as- with rapture on the beauties oqimrl8o f ,ht love they should inhabit, when ;a ey ed, would meet to part no more forever. In ld this style she closed her letter, which she iat was about folding, when a note from her ter uncle was laid before her. She opened it or nervously, and read as follows: ity "MY DEAR NIECE :-The third year ha" a- now commenced since the unfortunate cir- he cumstances  which led to our separation n- took place. I am satisfied that you have Du been the victim of calumny, and that I have \ n- wronged you ; can you forget the past and m come to me again? O, Evy, I am a poor d old Man, sick at heart and tired of life. I n- am very ill-confined to my bed, in fact--' r- and there is no kindred hand tonmoeoth my ir pillow, or to close. my eyes if I should die. h My poor old mother-in-law is bed-ridden, ri and is fast passing to that better land where n I  trust I shall soon find rest. Biddy Ryan I, is my only attendant, and-as far as care fAir , my comfort is concerned, I need no other d I I did, there are hundreds I suppose, who would travel upon their hands and knees a mile to serve me-but' there is no niece- - no son among them. Come to me, Evy, a Bernard is not at home,and has not been for e some days. I  do not ask you to stay when r he returns, for It know it would be painful r to you, but come to me now and let me heat i you say that you forgive 3 "   Your poor, enfeebled uncle, R ROBERT W ILSON." ' Afi, how the old feeling came back to the heart of Eveleen when she perused thWi note!. in a   moment everything was for- gotten, everything forgiven. Already she could see her uncle stretched upon a bed of pain, sick, pale, emaciated--perhaps dyinog, and the sympathy that at once welled upS her pure heart, drove hence every recoes!e. finn of the deep wrong he had inflicted upon her. Making a little postscript in her l*t*  to Haviland o   inform him of the Btfp^$ i   wi about taking and the cause of it, she ftlded, sealed, and dispatched it; and then hurrying on her hat, she hastened to inform Mrs. Jackson of her resolve. She found that lady in conversation -with .old Biddy Ryan, who had been the bearer of the note from Mr, Wilson, and who had already im- parted to the widow the probable contents of it. ' Go, my child," said the latter; as with a tear glistening in each eye at tfte thought of separation, she embraced and kissed Eveleen, " you have a holy duty to perform, discharge it like a Christian, but don't forget, while in your uncle's mansion, how closely you have twined yourself around this widowed heart; I should die of grief, my daughter, if I thought you could forget me!" and, as she ceased speaking, the kind lady turned her haad to hide her emotion. "Forget you, -nother!' exclaimed Eve- Jeen as she kissed the widow fervently, "forget you! Ah, now, that's an unkind thought! If I even dreamed that I could lose the recollection of such kindnesses as I have received at your hands, I should hate myself. Forget you! Ah, mother, dear mother, recall that expression." P"It was an unkind thought," replied the widow, smiling through her tears, "; and I do recall it Now go, and God bless you!" "Why, mother," said Eveleen, merrily, as she clasped old Biddy's hand, and pre- pared to start--"I am not going to leave you for good--no, b, if you expect to get rid of me so easily, you are mistaken; I phall. return when my cousin arrives, and that's likely to. happen at any timeryou know-to-morrow, perhaps. Good-bye 1" "Good-bye, my sweet child!" was the widow's response, " and may He who guards the innocent, watch over and protectryou V" Eveleen and old Biddy started towards the farmer's house, and were soon at the bedside of the sick man. " God bless you, my child!" exclaimed tie old man, as Eve- leen advanced towards his couch, and bent her head to kiss him. "You- have come, then, to see your poor old uncle ."  "Didn't I toll you she wud." exclaimed old Biddy, " sure, she cudn't belong to the mother iv she wudn't, and she's as much like the mother at her age, as wan pea is like another." "So she is, so she is," said Robert Wil- son, as he stretched forth his emaciated arm, and took the small white hand of Eveleen within his own, -while he gazed into her mild, clear blue eye, with all his former tenderness-"' YOu will forgive a foolish, headstrong old nan," he continued, at length, "' for the unkindness which he, in his blind wrath, inflicted on you, won't you, love 1?" ,b on't speak of it, uncle," answered Eveelen, who could not restrain her tears ascshe noted his altered appearance. He had been sik but- a few days, and yet he e .    '   e looked as care-worn, pale and haggard, a n though he had lain there as many months. i Eveleen had learned from one of the tarm dservants, that her uncle was unwell, but the idea had never entered her-mind that he was E seriously sick. "You are very ill," she continued, as she layed her hand upon his fevered brow. "Why did you not send for I me before V"  *" wanted to," was the farmer's reply, I "obut I was restrained by shame. O, Evy, , you told me that I would one day regret my usage of you--I have never forgotten the temark--and fearfully has your prophecy been verified, for I have never known a happy hour from that moment. My hasty action has reduced me- to what 'you see; my disease has been-more of the mind than the body, and now that you are near me, I shall soon be well again." '"I hlope so, uncle," 'said Eveleen, wiping away the tears which had gathered -in her eyes. ; How is William Haviland i" said the sick man, abruptly, after a short pause. "He is quite well, uncle," answered Eve- leen; "tI received a letter from him but a few hours since." "Where was he then?" inquired the far. mer. "In Dublin," answered Eveleen. Robert Wilson wa silent for some mo ments, apparently indulging in thoughts of a disagreeable nature, for an expression of pain was visible upon his countenance, aind at length, heaving a diep sigh, he said, "I wonder Where my vagabond son canb-e .  I have neither seen nor heard from him in three days. Well, well, I suppose he will: come to me when everybody else is tired of his company. It is hard to speak in con. demnatory terms of one's own flesh and blood, Evy, but I fear my son is a very bad man.' 'As Eveleen felt certain of what her uncle only feared, she could only answer his last remark with a deep sigh. '(Go to bed, Evy," said the farmer, at length, "Biddy will watch by me to-night, and you are tired, I know, for your eyes look swollen lA/d heavy." Eveleen did in truth feel very unwell. The excitement through which she had passed had weakened her, and she was faint and weary. Still, she tried to persuade' her uncle to allow her to remain at his bedside, in the hope that she would, after resting awhile, feel better. The farmer, however, would not hear to it. ." Go to bed, Evy," he said, kindly, " there's a sweet child. 1 should not feel so well satisfied to have yoe with mea to-night. I want to think, and if you are near me I shall not be able to fix my mind upon any subject but that of yoo wrongs. Tomihorrow I shall be better ip pared to talk to you."  &#xD;<pb n="48-49 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7813-00000026"/> Good night, then," said Eveleen as shie / arose to obey him, " but you must try to regard the past as something that never had a reality; look upon it to-morrow as an un- pleasant dream from which you have just awoke, and when you greet me in the morn- %  ing. let it be with the same look and feeling that characterized you of old. ' Once more, good night, dear uncle," and taking her way to her own sleeping apartment, which had - never been tenanted since she left it, she was soon buried in sweet repsse, Early on the following evening William Haviland was seated by himself in the Bra- zen Head Hotel, with Eveleen's letter before him. "What a happy fellow 1 am," he ex- claimed, as he pressed the letter again and again to his. lips, "to possets the love of such a girl. O, Eveleen," he continued, as he folded and placed the letter in his bosom, "who could-go wrong, with such an angel as thou art to guide him?" He arose, made his way to the street, and was met at the porch of tihe door by a young man about his own age, whose hand he grasped and shook heartily, "Well met, Frank," he exclaimed, "I was just about X starting in search of yoiu, how do things progress?"  "Not as well as I coula wish," was the i answer, given int a low, captious tone ofh  voice; "there is too much jealousy and X heart-burning abroad-there is not that una- 3 nimity of feeling apparent that-should cha- c racterize men engaged in the movement. I, \ as you know, Willy, am a rigid Catholic; I i love my religion, and in all things spiritual J I submit myself to my pastor, but in nothing farther.

"  I will be with you, if notling happens to prevent me," said Iaviland, and they tl parted. 'Haviland took his way towards the Free- k man's Journal office, when, after a short h conversation with the editor, he started on I ais way back, and once or twice, as he pf walked along, the figure of a  boy might tl have been seen behind him. Reaching the h Brazen Head again he wrote awhile, and th at about half past nine, he sallied forth and bent his steps in the direction of that famous hi promenade, Sackville street. le had not w got far from the hotel, when a slight shriek ea just ahead of him arrested his attention, hi   ie and looking up, he saw a female struggling to in the grasp of a man, Ever ready to assist Ld the weaker party, especially if that party i- happened to be a woman, he quickened his st pace, and, as he reached the spot the man i- fled. and the woman fell fainting in his arms y         a           d       CHAPTER XI. e HAVILAND'S first impulse was to sh6ut fort a assistance, and he was about to do so, when - ,a slight movement on the part of the woman e evidenced the fact that she was reviving. - She recovered slowly, and at length, as if 1 by a great effort, raised herself from the support of the young man, and looked tremb- s lingly around. Seemingly satisfied that the , danger which had threatenld was over, she I directed her gaze towards Haviland, and said in a feeble voice- "Thank Heaven, he has gone, and left me uninjured!

"i t  have done npting   to merit yqur thanks," replied -aviland, as he looked into her face, which he could see, by the dim rays of a  street lamp, possessed many marks of beauty-'" the pleasure of having rescued a defenceless woman from the grasp of a  ruffian, sufficienthy pays me for any fisk I  may have run, or any trouble I may have taken.

From the time   of my first acquaint. ance with him, he has followed me unceas. ingly, and when hemfound that I would not listen to his infamous proposals, he has ac- tually gone so far as to assault me in the street, and I am now almost afraid to stir, for fear of meeting him." l Did you learn his first name V" inquire4 'Haviland. "Yes, sir. I  thiRk it is Bernard," was -the reply. "'I thought so," replied Haviland ; "I know him well. This is no new offenoe- he has been guilty of it frequently before. I have had the pleasure of foiling him re- peatedly myself, and I am glad that 1 have the opportunity of doing so again. But why have not your friends pursued and brought the miscreant to justice .?" 6"I  have no friends," answered the fem/ale, heaving a  deep sigh; "I am aolone in the- world.

You have taken trouble enough for me already." Haviland was touched to the heart by the tone of deep dejection in which these words g were jttered. He was all unsuspicious. of guile, and even had he been disposed to doubt the woman's story, her mention of the name, of'Bernard Wilson would have put every such doubt to flight. His sympathies were at once enlisted, and Forgetting all about lis appointment in Sackville street, he determined to see the ill-used woman safe home, and render her all the aid in his power. "( You wiil not think me impertinent if I inquire your name!" he said, kindly. "O, no, sir," she answered readily, "my  name is Alice Carson." "And' where do you live?" was his next inquiry. 'I am almost ashamed to tell you," sshe  answered, ' for the locality is anything but  a respectable one; and yet your own good ' sense must tell you that it is not in the power I of the poverty-stricken to chose the locality e in which they would reside, or the corm- i panions they would keep. Poverty, sir, is ] no crime, but the more wealthy classes seem f to regard it in that light,; because the poor 1 are sometimes forced by necessity to dwell e among the vile.   My residence is at Pie I Corner opposite Dame-street."     a "It is indeed an unfitting neighborhood I flor one of as much intelligence and delicacy a as you seem to possess, to reside in. You 1 have evidently seen better days--how did'  this sad reverse of fortune come about?" "If you wil accompany me to my wretch- v ed abode," -said the woman in -a mournful I tone, ' I will give you the history of my a life, in the recital of which, if you find much V to condemr. you will also find much to pity o me for"       .  "I was just about offering to see you ] home," said Haviland, whose curiosity to e learn his ,companion's history was now a almost aas great as his desire to serve f her.                  a 4"Thank you," she replied, with fervor, c "a  thousand times, thank you! I should a scarcely have dared to venture alone, for the t figure of that terrible man haunts me contin- u [ually," and timidly taking his arm, they a walked along together. The reader has long ere this divined that f the timid and lady-like Alice Carson was inone- other than Nelly Blossom, the bold h bar-maid of the hovel on the quays. She s had readily undertaken Phe task which Ber- h nard had given her to perform, for, apart tl from the pecuniary reward which had been o promised her, she possessed a daring, reck- h less disposition, not at all in keeping with her delicate appearance, and rather liked e     n'the excitement. She had oeen familiar with n vice in its worst form almost from her e infancy. She had graduated from St. Giles'e in England, and after having followed a e most vicious course in London, during which 3 time she had made the acquaintance of many fashionable and dissipated youths, from D whom'she had extracted much knowledge as well as money, she had at length been t obliged to fly on account of being concerned s in a transaction in which a wild youth of Irespectable. parentage lost his life. I She 3 was naturally quite intelligent, and from thei : mixed society in 'which she had from time I to time moved, she had-managed to pick up a very fair knowledge of genteel life, and when she felt inclined could play the lady to/ perfection.  Her appearance, too, as we have already stated,b Was in her favor. She was slight built, and looked almost sickly, though her frame ;was close knit, and she was active, sinewy, and possessed more strength and endurance6 than many women of more robust appearance Her face to a casual observer, would not have at all bespoke a vicious heart, but to ons-whe studied character closely, there was ":a lurk ing devil" in her eyes, which were large, lustrous, and black as-midnight, and a spite- ful expression around the corners of her thinly-cut, nervous lips;. Her hair, like her eyes, was black as the raven's wing, while her complexion was dark, and her -whole appearance bespoke a temperament of -the nervous-bilious- order ,well calculated to accompany a character possessing a " mind to dare and a will to Aocute" crimes how- ever heinous.  Such was the character of the' womar who now hung upon the arm of William Haviland, and as they walked slowly along, she, while pretending to be filled with fear, was counting, in her own mind, the chances of the success or failure of the plot which she and her vile companions had concocted. Ever and anon as some pedestrian approach- ed them, she would uttter an exclamation of alarm,and cling to Haviland as though fear- ful thif she was about to be forced from his side by violence, and so well did she sue- ceed in playing her part that when they arrived at the house, Hasviland, who had at first felt some slight misgivings, was entirely unsuspicious with' regard to her t-ue char- acter. "Come in," she said, as they paused be- fore the door. Haviland hesitated a moment, to question himself as to the propriety of the step he was about talking, but at length his desire to hear the girl's story, and to ascertain all the particulars concerning this new villany on the part of Bernard, determined him, ana he entered. Passing up a  ncketty flight of stairs, they entered a  miserlablv Poor, though tid;look-  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7813-00000028"/> gig apa tment, and placing a chair for him, Nelly requested Haviland to be seated, while she proceededl to procure a light and to di- vest herself of her hat and shawl. The furniture of the room consisted of a bed, a table, three chairs, a well-worn carpet, a sort of bureau, and a few other trifling arti- cles; butV-the manner in which they were disposed showed a strict regard to order, and everything looked scrupulously clean. Having picked up the wick of the lamp which burned somewhat dimly, the perfidi- ous Nelly seated herself beside Haviland, and heaving a deep sigh, she said- "You see, sir, the manner in which I am obliged to live. From one week's end to another, I sit alone in this cheerless cham- ber, endeavoring by my work to make an honest livelihood. Seldom  is my heart cheered by a kind word or look, for the only human being that deigns to look in upon me is my exacting landlady, whose sympathies, if she ever ha4; any, are frozen, and whose only desire is to obtain the rent." ".Yours is indeed a hard lot," said Havi- land, " and if it is in my power in any way to ameliorate your condition, you may rely upon my friendship. But, surely, it has not been always thus with you. What has placed yod in such a friendless, necessitated condition?"' "' That," said, Nelly, with well-assumed indignation, ' which has placed too many of my sex in even a worse position than I oc- cupy---deception. I promised to tell vou something of my history, and I will keep my word, though I 4istnecessarily be brief, for it is growing late, and I would not have a man seen leaving my apartment at an un- seasonable hour. I, as you will doubtless have observed from my accent, was born in London.  My father and mother are both living, but I have neither seen nor heard I from them in five years. About six years  ago I made the acquaintance of a young i man, whose company I kept contrary to the; wishes of my parents. It would answer no I purpose for me to tell you' everything that transpired, for my case is only one among! thousands of others of Which you have doubtless either heard or read. I trusted i and-wasbetrayed.  Bowed down by shame : and grief, H fled from the presence of those I who had reared me, and took refuge among e strangers.  I obtained a situation as gover- I ness in a respectable family, and by -a life  of sincere repentance endeavored to atone  for my fault. The secret of my  degrada- tion was locked in my own breast and I was  respected, till in an unlucky hour, a friend i of the man who betrayed me   visited the t family with whom I was living and recog- I nised me. He   informed them of my fall, and I was again thrown   upon the wide i world. Since that time I have not remained i 1Ing in one place. i have wandered around ]   , the world like a restless spirit, with none to ,care for,- none to pity me. Some tthree weeks since the landlady of this house in- troduced me to the man from whom you trescued me, as a friend of hers. I was not long in discovering that, however friendly he might be to her, he was no friend of mine, and I forbade him ever to come near me. To this,- however, he has not paid the slightest attention; but persists in follow. ing me up wherever he may find me---he has on one or two occasions actually entered my room, and sought by force to detain me; but my shrieks for assistance has frightened him and forced him to leave me. My wretchedness now-has become so great that I am tired of life. and shall gladly welcome the hour that lays me with the dead." t She ceased speaking, and Haviland, who felt for her the keenest commiseration, asked her if, in the course of all her vicis- situdes, she had not met some friend in whom she could repose confidence?  "Never but one," she replied dejectedly, "and to that one I wish to write a few lines. I wish to write once--this very night-for if I have to live this way much longer, I shall go mad. You do not know 'what wicked thoughts have been pressing upon my brain lately, nor does my friend, but I want him to know,- I wish to confess him, but my brain is confused, my hand is nervous and I cannot write. May I beg the favor of you to write a few lines as I shall dic. tate?" "With pleasure," replied Haviland. "I ' shall be only too happy to do anything that will tend in the slightest degree to aid you." "Thank you,' said Nelly,s she pro- ceeded to the bureau and brought forth writing materials, which she placed upon the table. "I do not wish you to know my friend's name or address," she continued;  (" you must excuse me for remaining silent in this respect, and if you will act as my amanuensis for a few moments, I shall be forever obliged to you."  / "I am ready," said Haviland, taking his seat at the table. "Well, then," said Nelly, " please write thus: 'My   dear friend--It is some'time since I have written to you, nor should I have done so now, had not dire necessity compelled me to take such a course., Since I have been in Dublin, everything has gone wrong with me, all my plans have failed, and although  my acquaintances are not aware of the fact, I am here without a pen. ny.  I am driven' almost to desperation by my pressing wants, and as though it were not bnough to suler poverty, I am malig. nantly pursued by a fiend named Bernard Wilson, who takes every opportunity to an. noy me.  For some   time past the mos wicked thoughts have taken possesion ' me, and I have a number of times lately A .   contemplated rbbe!y.  You will be sur- prised when you Tead this confession, but I assure you it is true. I have endeavored to banish such evil ideas, but all to no pur- pole,and I know not how soon- I may be led to the commission of some such act." Nelly, who had been busily engaged in placing a small package into the pocket of the young man, as he wrote, ceased, and Haviland, with a look of surprise, exclaim- ed-"- Is it possible that you could have so far forgotten your accountability to Heaven, as to indulge in thoughts of so horrible a nature ."  "I could not help it," she answered; " if you did but know how I have struggled against temptatioWwhen beset by hunger and the danger of being turned into the streets penniless, you would not so much wonder at me. But I trust I shall be able hereafter to better control myself.' At this moment a shrill female voice upon the stairs called, "Miss Carson." "That is my landlady's voice," said Nel- ly, turning to Haviland ; "I must obey the' summons; stay here, and I will be with you immediately," and she hastily left the apart- ment. Fifteen minutes passed by, and Nelly did not return. In the meanwhile Haviland was pondering upon the singular position 'in which he found himself placed. d What strange events meet us at every turn in this life,"' he mused; " two hours since I was seated in a hotel, perusing a letter from my own dear girl, and now I am seated in a Bhouse that I neverwas in before, and that I know nothing of, engaged in writing a letter to I know not who. What mystery and misery is all around us! What scenes of crime, and poverty, and suffering are to be found in every street, and lane, and court, and alley. i cannot help feeling compassion for this woman, and yet there is something about her that I do not exactly like." His soliloquy was cut short by a piercing cry of "Murder!" which proceeded from the room immediately adjoining the one- he was in. Starting up instantly, he paused and listened for a repetition of the sound. He had not to wait long, for almost instantly the cry was repeated, and seemed to come from a man who was sufferingifrom stran- gulation. Without waiting any longer, he bobunded through the door, and rushed to the room from whence the cry proceeded. He found'the door unlocked, and dashing in, what was his surprise to find a well-dressed man, who had apparently just arisen from bed, entirely alone, shouting without the  slightest apparent cause. "' What is the matter, my friend?" in- quired, Haviland, whose first impression was that he was addressing a lunatic. - "( What is the matter, eh ." exclaimed the man, who was no other than Bill Stark, and   /                  a ' who had been dressed up by Bernard for occasion; " we'll soon see what the matter is! Ydu Attempt to murder anrid rob a man, and then ask him what the matter is!-That game won't do for me--I'm too old a bird to -be caught by such chaff!"-"nd seizing- Havi- land in his herculean gripe, he reiterated the ,cry of "Murder! help! thieves!? with all the force of which his lungs were capable, "Let go your hold!" cried RHviland, who now felt satisfied that he was grasped by either a knave or a madman. "I am nei- ther a robber, nor a murderer, but I shall do you ad injury if you do not release me!" "Yes, yes!" cried Stark, tightening his gripe, "I know you will do me an injury if Ido release you, andI think it's my best policy to hang on. Murder! help!" Haviland struggled desperately, to free himself, and so far succeeded as to get one of his arms at liberty. He then seized a case-knife which lay upon a chair near him, and finding his strength fast giving way, he wounded his-antagonist upon the wrist to break his hold, when just as he did so, the door was thrown open, and two policemen, headed by Nelly Blossom, rushed upon the scene. "There he is!" cried Nelly, pointing to Haviland--.i"Seizerhim l-seize the robber!" In a moment Haviland, who, struck dumb with amazement, made no resistance, was seized by the police. "What is the meaning of all this '." said Haviland, addressing Nelly, as soon as he could find words. "That's a quistion, young man," she re-  plied, looking him straight in the face without in the least changing countenance, "which you'll have to answer before a magistrate." Am I dreaming," said Haviland, in a , tone. of amazement, " or is this some plea- sant farce that you have been getting up for rmy amusement?" "It's meself that thinks, me tight lad," said one of the policemen, "that it's a i mighty unpleasant farce you'll find it, iv the 3 charge that's brought agin you is made I good before his lordship. Come along wid  us." ' "Search him!" cried Stark, "' ho has got i a packet of notes on the Bank of England, -belonging to me in his coat pocket and he e may attempt to get rid of them." e "I will not submit to this indignity!" cried a Haviland, as the policeman, inaccordance , with the directions of Stark, attempted to d insert his hand into his pocket---"I am no i thief, and will not suffer; myself to be search- ' e ed-- so stand off' and breaking from his captors wiih -a sudden jerk, he brandished - the knife which he still held in his hand, and n stood at bay. Resistance, however, was useless; for a blow from a truncheon disabled e his arm, and he was soon again in the power d of the policeman, who, diving his hand into  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7813-00000029"/> the pocket, brought forth, to Haviland's atter amazement and consternation, the packet of notes. "I am the victim of some damnable con- spiracy!" cried the young man, "and I de- clare before Heaven that I never saw that packet before!" "It's wastin' breath ye are, young gintle- man," said the policeman who had taken the packet from him-" it's betther for you to kape cool and take it aisy. You see, we're used to these things, an' ye must come along pacably or it'll be worse for you, so it will!"            v "Stay!" cried Nelly, " search the room that he and myself occupied before you go --I peeped through the key-hole after he had sent me out, and saw him writing some- thing, which may be ofasome importance. Haviland now saw exactly how he was situated, and was satisfied that both Stark -and Nelly were the tools of Bernard. Ev- ery little circumstance that had transpired came vividly to his imagination, and he saw it as plainly as though the whole matter had been laid naked before him by his enemies. "Will I never learn wisdom '!"he me- chanically ejaculated, in the bitterness of spirit.  "I hope you will," said Stark, sarcasti-  cally, "' older men than you have learned wisdom, and I don't see what's to hinder a you." Har "Hark you," replied Haviland, fixing his I gaze first upon Stark and then upon Nelly, 1 "you are, both of you, led on to this by a i man who has sworn my destruction. That 1 man is Bernard Wilson. -You may think,  perhaps, that he is perfectly safe, but I tell 1 you he stands upon the edge of an abyss, 1 and look to it, that when he falls, he does f not drag you with him."        V "Well-, you are, without exception," said 1 Nelly, deliberately weighing her words as 3 she uttered them, " the most impudent thief E I ever met in my life, and I've come across I a few of them in my travels. You come h into a house, attempt to rob and murder a gentleman, and when caught in the very act, ] you make as if you was the most innocent h man in the world, and talk of persons that i nobody ever heard of but yourself."  t "Let me see if I know  him," said the 1 voice of a female on the stairs, and- the next 3 moment a coarse-looking, broad-shouldered, c red-faced trull entered the room, and rush- a ing up to Haviland, she grabbed his hand e ad   shook it heartily, exclaiming, "Why,   's Billy Haviland, how are you? It's a long e time since I'veseen you before, and I'm sorry to see you now, in such a fix as this i- How are all the boys--Limpy Dick, Rollick i- some Jack, Flashy Ben, Tricky Bob, ant. Lt the rest of 'em ."    ' "Here," said Haviltnd, whose patience - was fairly exhausted, addressing the police- e men, (" if I must go to prison, take me at oonce, for any place is preferable to this." "3  Well, Bill," said the disgustinrg creature e who had addressed him, "I didn't think t you'd give a body the cold shoulder in that style. However, I don't ask no favors of i you, and you may cut it just as fat as you've ) a mind to." "Will you take me hnce " said Havi- - land again addressing the policemen. "It's me own opinion," said the one who I acted as spokesman," that you'll be more anxious to lave it than you wor to enther it, but since you're in a hurry, we'll secure the Iwritin' in the other room, jist, and thin we'll be aff," and entering the apartment into which Haviland had been led by Nelly, the policemen took charge of the manuscript which the young man had written, and in a short time thereafter, Haviland was taken before a magistrate and committed for ex. amination, while Nelly was held to bail to testify, and Bill Stark, who represented him- self as an American gentleman, travelling for pleasure, and gave his name as Capt. Richard Canter, after stating that he had been taken to the house while in a state of inebriety, or he would never, have been - there-that he sprang- from his bed and closed with the robber, who thereupon at- tempted to murder him with a knife, when the police entered and saved him-after stating all/this, I say, with the air of a man who meant exactly what he said, he ex- pressed his willingness to be responsible for Nelly's appearance when wanted, and then started for the hovel on-the quays, whither he was soon afterwards followed 'by Nelly herself. "O, Eveleen! dear Eveleen!" exclaimea Haviland, as the prison door closed upon him, and he was left alone, " how, O, how shall I break this to thee, without breaking thy heart!"Then raising his eyes toward Heaven, he exclaimed, "Oh, Heavenly Father, if Thou dost, for any wise purpose of Thine own, bring this affliction upon her and me, bestow upon us, I beseech Thee, strength to bear it!"   CHAPTER XII. 1BlBNARD WILSON, Pat Flanders, and the hoy, Tim Doyle, sat in the hovel, on the night on which the events chronicled in the last chapter took place-the former in front of the table, and the latter in his accustomed corner, "Do you hear?" said Bernard; "' I am going to America, and I shall take you with me. I think it's more than likely that I shall want to use you there. You must fol- low my instructions to the letter, and do exact]- what I tell you to, and nothing more. Do yot understand that!" "I do," answered the boy, "sure you won't sthop me frim sthalin' ." No, I won't stop you from stealing," an- swered Bernard, looking savagely at the boy, "but I want you to pay particular atten- tion to what I am going to say now--if from the ,time we leave Ireland, you undertake to /teal even so much as the value of a pin's  worth more than I tell you to, I will kill i you.  You hear what I say, don't you? i Don't forget it, for your life depends on i-- i I will kill you. Do you think you can re- I member that ." I do," answered the boy, who shrugged t his shoulders up, and  dropping his neck a down like a tortoise drawing its head within its shell, " but sure, Pat told me I cud sthale t more nor I cud carry."       .  "You are to mind me," said Bernard, at i the same time throwing a pewter mug at the b boy's head, " and not Pat, I want you to understand that too."         i1 "Yis, Timmy," said Pat, who up to this t time had remained silent, " you are to mind a masther Wilson, for he knows betther nor I p when .it's safe to sthale; but sure, he'll give a you a  plenty of chances, niver fear." n "I will, if he behaves himself, and not ti without," said Bernard, eyeing the boy, who h sat ready for a  dodge, in case the genteel h ruffian should take it into his head to throw w anything'else at him. " I wonder how our cl plot has succeeded "  he remarked, turning m to Pat.                fi "Beautiful!" exclaimed that individual, dt 'cenfidentlyj " how could it help succeedin', ain sich a lady as Nelly Blossom at the N head of it! Beautiful! Divil a doubt in fit it, at all!" U We   shall soon know at all events," said pi Bernard, "for here they are!" and as he se spoke a  rap was heard at the front door, and, to the next moment Stark and Nelly were ad- wi mitted, and entered the apartment. " Well, " how did you succeed?" he continued, when as they were seated.           nil "  Excellently," replied Nelly,. "we've W got him as dead as a door nail, and without ov any trouble worth speaking of; why, he's ge as green as a school -girl; he didn't suspect wi *        S er   the slightest thing till we'd got him fairly into the trap, and even then he was foolish enough to try to exculpate himself, and tne every word he uttered only seemed to make he his guilt appear more plain. I don't take he any merit to myself for such a performance, ,nt I assure you, for I know many a girl of ed twelve years who could have cooked'his goose for him easily." m  "Now, if we can only manage to have th him indicted, tried, convicted, sentenced and I transported, I shall hardly be able to con- f1- tain myself with joy. And Eveleen, my do dear, sweet, pleasant little cousin Eveleenh e. with what satisfaction I will send her an ac- count of his incarceration! I'd give an )u hundred pound to see her when she reads it! It will nearly break her heart, but not a- quite, for she will feel satisfied of his inno- y, cence, and will live to cherish his memory i- and bring me to justice, which I shall stay n here for the purpose of affording her an op- ze portunity to do, of course! While he is in is prison awaiting a safe conveyance to Ans- II tralia, I won't be cutting it across the blue waters on my way to New York, where it - is my intention, if possible, to prepare a - home for her!  O, no, of course not!" And Bernard Wilson in his fiendish ex- d tacy, laughed till the little room echoed again with his unholy mirth. i "So large an amount of satisfaction ought e to be worth something, and I hope you won't forget before you go, to whom you are t indebted," said NBlly, who had an eye to- a business;  )  "Indeed I will not, Nelly. I have a little business of a private nature to attend 3 to in Kildare, before I cut and run for good, I and after that is accomplished I will recom- pense you.  But how did you manage to i succeed with so little trouble.? Cpme tell me all about it---I could listen to hle lpar- ; ticulars of such a matter all night!" and as , he said this, the unnatural man rubbed his hands gleefully, and listened attentively, whiie Nelly went carefully over her whole course of procedure from the time she com- menced her abominable task till she  had finished it by consigning Haviland to a dungeon.      I  '"You are worth your weight in gold, Nll!" cried   Bernard, when she had finished.        . "I  am glad you think so," answered the perfidious woman, "  and 4 hope when you settle with me, you will pay me according to my  worth."  Then rising from the chair which she had occupied, she continued, "  But for my part, I am somewhat tired,ad as it is growing late I shall go to bed. Good night and sweet slumber'to you, and I say Wilson (and here an ixnpious laugh spread over the features of the woman,) don't for- get me in your prayers---I shouldn't sleep well if I thought you would--there is such a  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7813-00000030"/> consolation in the thought 'that the petition of a good mall is ascending to the throne of grace in behalf of such a hard customer as I am! Farewell!" and with a heartless laugh the she devil left Bernard and his compa- nions alone. By this time sleep had began to exert its influence upon the villains. Bill Starl had laid his head upon the table and was snoring loudly. Pat Flanders could hardly keep his eyes open, and Bernard! himself showed by his frequent- yawning that he was growing drowsy. The only really wide awake one of the party was the boy Tim, who seemed never to sleep, but always to be on the look out for a chance to steal. The passion for theft seemed to have been born in him, for he had evinced a desire to appropriate to his own use articles which did not belong to him, from his infancy, and he now sat in- his corner watching with eager eyes the countenances of the three men, patiently awaiting the moment when the deep sleep which he knew would soon be upon them, should give him an opportunity to rummage their pockets, at which interesting employ- ment they had often detected him. "Pat, are you going to sleep ." said Ber- nard, turning his eyea lazily towards that individual. But Pat was already asleep, and did not hear him. 6"Well, well," he continued, pushing the light fafther from him, and laying his own head upon the table, "I suppose we should all sleep." As he rested his right cheek upon his arm, his eyes encountered the big optics of Tim fixed upon him. "Why in h-11 don't you go to sleep, you d--d scum of the earth ." he growled. The boy quietly closed his eyes and made no answer. It was not long before he re- opened them, however; but finding that Bernard was not yet quite fast asleep, he closed them again instantly-while the lat- ter indulging in such mutterings as, " want to steal; put you to sleep one o' these days, --laudanum-d-d  hell-hound," &amp;c., at length slept as soundly as one of so vile a nature can be supposed to sleep, and in this position I will for a time leave the whole vile crew. I will now pass over some three weeks, during which time the Grand Jury, which was in session at the time of Haviland's arrest, found a bill bf indictment against the unfortunate young man for robbery, and as the Quarter Sessions of the Recorder's Court was being held, his trial was brought on in due course. I will not attempt to describe the feelings of Eveleen, when the horrible truth was revealed to her that her lover was arrested on so foul a charge. It is not necessary to say that she did not, for a moment doubt his entire innocence. From the time of his incarceration to the day of   his trial, she, accompanied by Mrs. Jack%, visited him constantly. To them he related, without reservation, every incident con- nected with the affair; and they felt as sure of his acquittal as they were certain of his innocence. Eveleen, as Bernard had anti- cipated, at first came near sinking under the effects of the dreadful blow, but, buoyed up by the hope of his speedy acquittal, and the consolation which the widow poured into her bleeding heart, she managed to subdue the wildness of her grief--especially when in the company of Haviland; although a week had not passed by ere she had fallen away to a mere shadow of her former self, and looked fit to drop into the grave. The day of trial at length arrived, and the court -room was orowded to suffocation, Haviland, pale and. somewhat emaciated, yet firm. and collected, was seated near his counsel, whom he had decided to assist himself, while Eveleen and Mrs. Jackson, upon whose dejected and te'arful counter nances the eyes of the vast assembly were from- time to time turned in sympathy, oc, cupied seats a' short distance from him. The counsel for the Queen read the charge against the prisoner to the jury, after which the name of Richard Canter was called, and Bill Stark, richly, though neatly, dressed, oame forward and took the stand. His statement was the same in effect as that' which he gave at the first examination of the prisoner, viz. : that he was an American gentleman making the tour of Europe-that he had indulged rather freely on the night of the robbery, and that he had been ac- costed by somebody, he did not recollect who, and conducted to the house in which the transaction took place, where he was put to bed-that sometime afterwards be was awoke by feeling a man's hand in his packet; that he bounded out of bed, and seized the robber, who proved to be the prisoner, and who would undoubtedly have tmurdered him had the police not oppor- ,tunely arrived. Stark was followed by tNelly Blossom, whose testimony was, in L substance, that the prisoner accosted her in the street, and prevailed upon her to accom- , pany him to the house in which the robbery took place-,-that when. they arrived there,' ,two gentlemens one of whom was very i much intoxicated, were talkiog to the larn, i lady-that the most sober of the two ro. i quested the landlady to put the gentlemen to i bed. stating atlthe same time that he had i picked him up in the street, as he seemed t to be a stranger, and did not know where he D was-going; that the landlady;consented to do so, and ,that after he was taken to a r room, the prisoner and herself proceeded up t stairs, and entered the room next' to his, r when the. prisoner proposed to her that tayx n should rob the stranger-that she seemingD consented, but wens out first on pretence ai *e   acertaining if anybody' was stirring, an notified the police, who arrived with hei just in time to prevent the escape of th prisoner. One of the policemen who made the arrest was next put upon the stand, and testified to having been called in by the las witness to arrest the prisoner, whom he found in the act of assaulting the complain! ant with a knife-that he resisted to the ut- most then they attempted to search him. and that they found a roll of bank notes in his pocket which the complainant said be- longed to him, and that in the room which he (prisoner) had occupied they found a sheet of paper with some writing upon it. The manuscript was produced and its iden- tity sworn to by the policeman, after which Eveleen Wilson was called to identify the handwriting of the prisoner--this, however, was dispensed with, Haviland admitting that thl writing was his own. A number of other witnesses of doubtful reputation, Fwhom Haviland had never seen before in his life were examined for the prosecution, who stated that they knew the prisoner, but had only very recently become acquainted with him, and this closed the testimony for the prosecution. For the defence it was an easy matter to impeach the testimony of the witnesses against the accused, for, with the exception 'of the complainant himself and the two po- licemen, they were known to belong to the very worst class of characters. It was no easy matter, however, to throw discredit upon the testimony of Stark, who, except to the friends of his unprincipled employer, was entirely unknown in Dublin, and all the shrewd cross-examination for the defence  could not succeed in eliciting the slightest - proof that he had acquaintance with any of 1 the witnesses. Again, although Haviland ( "old prove an unexceptiosable character J oui of Dublin, he utterly refused to give any c account of his proceedings while in the c capital, and this to everybody save his con- r fidentia. friends, looked suspicious. Every t effort had been made by the friends of the h accused to find out the whereabouts of Ber- tl nard Wilson, whom Haviland wished to con- fa front with his accuser, but all to no effect, tl he was nowhere to be found. The testimo- ny or both sides having been at length got a l through, Haviland arose to address the jury. al Every eye was immediately turned upon w him, and so profound was the silence that br the suppressed breathing of the eager audi- an tors could almost be heard.      tic "  Gentlemen of the Jury," he began---"I ac stand before you in a double light-I address viz you as both a  pleader and a prisoner. If I in were called upon to speak to you in behalf sw of another person than myself, I  think I net should feel fully equal to the task. but as it the is, my position is of so novel a character I evE scarcely realize the fact that  I am awake wh   and and in my right mind. It would be useless her for me to recapitulate the testimony offered the by the prosecution for my impeachment, for lade I have confidence enough in your intelli- and gence to think that most of it is already con- last demned by you. My chief ent wor shall he be to appeal to your reason as men ,ho Iknow ain- the world, and to your svmpathies .s lovers ut- of your kind. I want you, in imagination, to rim, travel back with me some twenty-five years s in Accompany me to a peaceful dwelling in be- Cork, where a young mother in extacy is rich bending over her- first born, while the part- d a ner alike of her joys and sorrows stands by n it. with pleasure on his face and a whole world len- of joy in his heart, Now watch with me rich the boy, as he grows--follow him through the all his childish days till he reaches manhood, ver, and see how, although wilful and passionate ;hat perhaps at times, he strives to. avoid every- of thing that is really dishonorable or base-- om mark how anxious he is to obtain the good ife, opinion of his fellow-men-how he strives rho to obtain the approbation, by diligent study, had of both parents and tutors. Now imagine 1ith that he has reached his twenty-second year, the and a fair young creature, bright and beau- tifil as the first openinga bud of Spring, and to pure as the dew drop that nestles in it seS at morning, hangs upon his arm and looks ion with rapture into his face. - Follow him Po- farther-he hias reached his twenl-fifth the year, and is about to be united to his heart's no idol; he is as, happy as the lark in the dit  rnpming-he knows neither sorrow nor dis- to content, but all is bright, and beautiful, er, and joyous. Now, think you, gentlemen, he when he has reached the .zenith of human ce happiness-when his fame is without a  blot Ist -when his real friends look admiringly of upon him, and the safety of her he love, id dearer than life itself is endangered-think er you, gentlemen, that under these circuimstan- iy cea he would commit an action that would ie cause histriends to blush for him  . Is it a- reasonable to suppose that he would crush y that young heart whose pride and pleasure it e has been to look to him as her protector, or -r that he would in one fatal moment blast a - fame that ihe has preserved untarnished ;, throughout his lifetime? "Sue, gentlemen of the jury, has been and is my case; and I cal upon you now by all that you hold most sacred, to deliberate I well before you render a verdict that will t bring blight and sorrow upon the innocent and unofeniding. '  Some portions of the tes- timony against me are, I admit, of a char. acter which seemns conclusive. but I am the victim of a  foul conspiracy, ihe grand mover in which, I  am satisfied, is a man who has sworn my destruction. Not one of the wit- nesses who have testified upon that stand that they were acquainted with me had 1 ever laid eyes upon until the fatal nihe when they caught me in their toils. fb4 \  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7813-00000031"/> woman, Alice Carson, lured me to the house  by a tale of woe, and while there I wrote, do, at her dictation, the note which has been ke used in evidence against me.     it i ' It were useless, gentlemen, for me to wi detain you longer, and I will submit my case nor to you, with the prayer that you may be di- rected by that Great Being who cannr ot err, m to judge correctly." ju Haviland sat down, and after some farther th proceedings, the Recorder having summed hi up and charged the jury, that body retired ac to deliberate. After having been absent g come two hours, they again returned into se Court and took their seats.      a "Gentlemen of the Jury," said the clerk, hi i, have you agreed upon a verdict"  fe This question was answered affirmatively hy the foreman. P' "Prisoner," continued the clerk, "look a upon the jury." P A momentS of fearful suspense filled he i bosom of Haviland's friends as he benthis a gaze upon the foreman, as if to read the verdict ere it was uttered. "Gentlemen of the Jury," said the clerk, e solemnly, "how say you, is the prisoner at s the bar guilty or not guiltyi'    r "GUILTY!" answered the foreman; and i as he did so, a shriek clear, wild and pierc-  ing, ran throughout the court-room, and Ev- 1 eleen Wilson swooned in the arms of Mrs.  Jacksor] About a week after the fearful scene which we have just narrated, took place, Eveleen was seated by the bedside of her uncle, who was fast becoming convalescent, while she herself looked as though death had claimed her for his prey. "Evy, my child," said the farmer, "you will die if yon take on so--try, do try to moderate your grief." "Why should I wish to live '" she an- swered, "has the world any charm for me, now  O. how eagerly would?welcome death, if it were God's will to send it!" "You must learn to feel differently, my dear girl," said her uncle, soothingly. You peak as one without hope--you believe Haviland guiltless, and yet you have not confidence enough in God's justice to hope that he will one day make the young man's innocence manifest-or you have not courage enough to bear the .ills of life till that day rrives."   "I know it is wrong. for me to feel rol do," she answered, as she applied her hand- kerchief to her Weeping eyes; "but, Uncle, it is hard to think how many thousand miles will in a few weeks separate us. You do not believe him guilty, do you, Uncle ." "Nor my sweet c hild," answered the far- mer, "as deep-rooted as have been my pre. judices against Haviland, I have never thought, even when I felt bitterest against him, that he would be guilty of a dishonest action, and I feel as certain that he is not guilty of the crime for which he has been sentenced to transportation, as I do that I am living, and it is my firm conviction that , his innocence will one day be made mani- fest.') "O, bless vou, Uncle," exclaimed the poor girl, throwing her arms about his neck, k and kissing him; A' bless you for that ex- pression of opinion, for it speaks comfort to e my sorrowing heart, and revives within me s a hope that I shall one day see. hbimagain. e  "I cannot imagine," continued the farmer, "what man, or set of men, could be base  :, enough to concoct and carry out such a con-  :t spiracy, but, whoever they are, no punish- ment which it is in the power of the law to d inflict, is sufficient for their crime. If my - own son were concerned in such a transac- r- tion, 1 would not stretch forth my hand to 8. save him from the gallows. By the way," he continued, as a look of surprise settled le upon his countenance, "I believe Bernard's e, name was mentioned in connection with that er business, was it not t" lt  "His name was alluded to in the note th which Haviland wrote at the dictation of that bad woman," replied Eveleen. ou  ( If I should find him guilty of such a to crime," said the farmer, and his face turned crimson with anger as he spoke, "no tie of m- blood should keep me from delivering him le, up to justice, even though he were to pay ne the forfeit with his life.

When Bernard Wilson and his father were left alone, they regarded each other for a moment steadily without speaking a word. The old man was the first to break the si lence. , ".I am sorry to see," he observed "that you have added eaves-dropping to the lis of your many bad qualities--but I trust in this instance, you have been made aware of the truth of the saying, 'that listeners never hear any good of themselves.' Where have you been for the past two weeks ." "I have been seeking abroad," answered Bernard, in a heartless tone ot' voice, " what ( I have never been able to find at home since that pest of my life first showed her hypo-  critical countenance in Kildare-pleasure. I "What!" said the farmer, his face glow-  ing with rage as he noticed the gaze of im- t pudent irony which had settled upon the face a of his stony-hearted son--" dare you address g me in this feelingless manner, after having been absent from home two whole weeks,  without even notifying me of your where- tl abouts, leaving me here to die, for aught 1 vou cared?

Bill Haviand is ord. pleased to think that I am his enemy-he si- knows that I have cause to be so--and if he alluded to me as such in a letter to some in- that timate friend of his, I don't see how I am list to blame for it." t in "Haviland never wrote the letter which eof was used in evidenceagainst him to afriend," ,ver said the farmer; " of that I feel confident- ave and I am half inclined to think that you know more about it than you are willing to red admit.

Eveleen, having arranged her hair and donned her hat and shawl, returned to her uncle's bedside, kissed and bade him good- bye, and then took her way back to Mrs. Jackson's, stopping on the road as she went, at the house of Biddy Ryan, to instruct that kind old creature to again take up her abode for a time with the farmer. "So, you have come back again," said Mrs. Jackson, ioyfully, as Eveleen rushed into her arms;"Oh, how delighted I am to have you with me once more. You can't tell how lonesome I have been while you were absent. Have you come back to stay, love, or must I again bear the pain of part- ing with you? To what am I indebted for this turn of good luhick 1 has your cousin re- turned ." "He has," answered Eveleen; "he ar- rived about half an hour since, and his stay there will regulate mine here. Oh, mother, you can't imagine how horribly he glared upon me when our eyes met; it seemed as though his look would petrify me with hor- ror, and 1 fled from him instinctively, as I would have done from a beast of prey." "' Well, thank Heaven, you are safe here," said the widow, as she tenderly kissed Eve- leen, " where it will be impossible for his malignity to reach you. It may be wicked, perhaps, but I feel that I could not help but rejoice at the news of that rman's death." "No, no, mother,' said Eveleen, " do not wish for his death, but rather -pray for his amendment." "So I would," answered the widow, " if there was the slightest probability of his ever becoming- a different man, but- I fear that he is too far gone in vice ever to be- come better." "Let us- at least hope that he may," said Eveleen; "he is my uncle's son, mother, and much as he hates me, I should rejoice to see him act once more in a manner that would regain for him his father's favor." "' So should 1,". answered Mrs. Jackson, "provided such action sprung from a sense of his past wickedness, and not a desire to secure the farmbr's wealth. Such I feel certain, however, will never be the case. But now let us change the subject. i have a letter for you. It was left here but a short time before you came in, and I was jdst about sending it to you as you entered the door. It is from Haviland, Hthink."' "O, let me have it!" exclaimed Eveleen, and eagerly receiving the letter which the widow took from her bosom and held towards her, she tremblingly broke the seal and read US follows;   t "BELOVED EVELEEN: By the time yo receive this I shall be on my way to a penal 3 colony, there to suffer for a crime iwhich I had rather, ten thousand times rathe, suffer death than commit, Forgive me, dearest, I if I did, at our last meeting, practice the only deception which I have ever used to- wards you, when I led you to suppose that we should meet again before my departure. Twenty times did I essay, as I held you t sobbing in my arms, to impart to you the fearful truth that we were about parting to meet no more forever perhaps in this world, but- my heart was in my throat and my tongue refused to utter the words. How. ever, I am now constrained to write what I t could not speak, and O,-may (God in His in- finite mercy grant you strength to bear the terrible announcement, and to tell you that even while you read these lines, the wind is bearing me swiftlyfrom Erin and from you. I am leaving you, dearest Eveleen, *,' It may be for years, And it may be forever," but let us hope for the best, let us not give way to despair, for who can tell what joy the future may have in store for us? or myself, whether I ever clasp you to' my bosom again or. not, I shall ever have you near me in imagination, and , "While my heart retains a pulse, 'Twill beat for thee alone." I shall fear neither storm nor shipwreck while upon the ocean, for the memory of you t will turn the howling of the wind to sweet- est music, and the crackling of the ship's t timbers, as perchance she strikes upon a a rock, will seem as the opening of a gate which lets me into heaven, where I shall wait for you, never, never, never, to be torn s from you again. And in the silent midnight, r when the wind is calm, and not a ruffle dis-  turbs the bosom of old ocean, will I not gaze up into the clear, blue expanse above, i and as , I watch that star whose beams so oft have lighted tme to thee,' will I not derive consolation from the-thought , that your dear eyes are fixed upon the same object 0O, Eveleen, light of my heart! ,dearly cherished object of my affection! the I -malice of man may separate us corporeally, but it cannot divorce our souls, for it was God who united them. This language might , seem extravagant to those who know not love, for they cannot ' translate the poetry of hearts like ours,' but I know, dear Eve- leen, it will meet a response in your heart, and that is all I ask. "Yes, dear Eveleen, I am leaving' thee,. but something tells me we shall meet again.

Let us school our- selves to think that ' sorrow and trouble are friends in disguise,' and that we shall one day experience the delights 'of a reunion which shall more than compensate for the heart- rending agony we have lately been called upon to endure. "' My position is indeed a dreadful one-I am here, surrounded by the most degraded,0f human beings-men with whom I have not a single feeling in common--whose minds are debased, whose natures ar6 coarse and brutal, and whose souls have never been lighted by a single ray of pure and holy love. I look at them, sweet Eveleen, I contrast their natures with yours, and then, O, how I loathe them! I am almost forced at such a time, to exclaim, '*My punishment is greater than 1 can bear!' and it seems to me that I have suddenly been shut out from the joys of heaven and thrown among the spirits of the damned. But although I am branded as a felon, shut out from all the joys of home, deprived of the extatic joy of looking into the clear depths of your mild blue eyes, and breathing upon your cheek, condemned, villi- fied, abused and apparently forsaken of God, yet am I happier--far happier than he who Wrought this mischief, for lie can never, never know that 'peace which passeth understanding'--he can never enjoy the fruits of even one ghod action-the curse which the Great Father ofus all pronounced upon the first, murderer will follow him through life--the brand of homicide is upon his guility brow, and a fugitive and a- vagabond shall he be upon the face of the earth.' i ( Hate cannot wish hhn worse Than guilt and shame have nmade him.' -he will paes through life with the dreadful consciousness that no human being loves him while living,or will cherish his memory wheu he' shall have passed away--he will drag out a miserable existence, the victim of his own bad passions-and when he conies to die-perchance upon- the gallows--'his wily companions will be remorse and despair, and he will leave this world without a single hope beyond the grave, How different is il cuae! I have one who through good   and evil report will love me still,. and wre should I die, will keep my memory green in her heart--I have friends who, coetious of my innocence, respect me, and I have faith and hope-those twin guardians of human happidess--to whisper in my ear of future joy. The future to me is full of bliss, but Bernard canl see nothing whien he strains his mental vision in that direction, but * the dark valley of the shadow of death,' without ' rod or staff to comfort' him. 4"And now farewells thou whom J have so devotedly loved, and-whom I now, that I am parted from thee, so wildly worship ; let me, in thus taking leave of you, call upon you by that sweet love which animates urboth, to keep up a brave heart--do not give. away to despair, for remember that upon your well-being depends my happiness--do not forget that you have my life in your keeping --that our hearts are united, and that when yours is cold, mine must cease to beat. Above all things, beware of your inhuman cousin--never trust yourself outside the house after dark unattended, for, like the Tell tiger waiting (or his prey, he watches but the unguarded moment when he may seize you. Give my love to Mrs. Jackson, my more than mother; tell her that I shall never cease to cherish for her all the affec. tion whichh a dutiful son should feel for a fond and tender mother, and that one of my brightest anticipations is that of one day proving to her the deep gratitude which I feel for all the kinfdness which she has shown me. '* Once more farewell, dearest, and that all good angels may watch over and protect you is the prayer of "Your eternal adorer, ' WILLIAM." The widow strove hard to repress the grief that filled her, as Eveleen stopped from time to time during her perusal of the letter, to wipe away the tears which blinded her, and when the reading was finished, Mrs. Jacksqn's pent-up grief foiund vent in Violent sobs of anguish. "Don't weep, mother," said Eveleen, a flood of. tears at the same time deluging her own cheeks; t we shall see iftn again." "God grant it," cried the widow, as she pressed her cheek against Eveleen, and their tears mingled in [dweet sympathy.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7813-00000033"/> CHAPTER XIV. BtRNARD WILSON, having reached his own 1 apartment,'entered it, and having locked the v door behind him and hung his handkerchief I over the keyhole to prevent the possibility 0 of his movements being witnessed by any o idle servant who might be curious enough 1 to peep through, he seated himself before a a table, and pulling forth a package of deeds 1 from his pocket, he proceeded to untie the i tape which held them together, and to com-  mence an examination of the documents. 1 The first manuscript which he opened had a a fresh, clean appearance, and seemed to i have been recently written. He glanced t over it rapidly, and,.his face assumed a de- f moniacal expression, as he progressed in the reading of it. "4 It is as I expected," he said at length, in a bitter tone, " he has destroyed the will which he had written, making me his sole heir, and has executed another, depriving me of all that he could by law take from me, and leaving the bulk of his property to her! D--n her! the meek-faced devil! Why in hell can't she die. What she has endured already would,have killed any other girl, but I believe she lives on purpose to spite me. She shall not, however, have' it, not a penny of it, for I will take the liberty Of ap- propriating, this document, and altering it to suit myself. In order to prove that lIcon- sider myself entitled to all the old gentle- man's wealth, I will just draw upon him for a few thousand pounds at once. As for the will, I can place a document resembling it in appearance, in its place. The probability is that my gracious father will not think of making any alteration in his will, and so will not discover the fraud. If he should. how- ever, find out my game, and write another will, I shall not relinquish the idea of getting him eventually to alter his resolution. J If 1 can, by any device, succeed in getting her to America after I go there, I do not think it will be a hard task to force her among the vilest of the vile. If I can manage to ruin her reputation, the old man will have nothing to choose between us on the score of cha- racter, and in that case, if he favored either of us, it would be myself." After overhauling all the papers, which consisted ofrdeeds, mortgages, certificates of stock, etc., he selected such as had his father's signature attached, and set about copying the autograph. He" worked dili- gently at this, till the shades of night began to gather around, when, apparently well satisfied with the result of his labor,-he ga- thered the manuscripts up, tied them as he had found them, and placing them in his pocket, he drew forth a huge key, and pro- ceeded noiselessly to the room in which his father's safe was kept, Having unlocked   and opened the door of the depository of bf old man's treasures, he put the documents (all but the will, for which he substituted a paper folded like it,) carefully back from whence he had taken them, and possessing himself of some three or four blank checks of the Bank of Ireland, he returned to his own room, and seating himself, he proceeded to fill them up. After he had finished them all, he scrutinized them carefully, and at length selecting one from the lot he placed it in his wallet, and lighting a lucifer match destroyed the rest. He then opened his trunk, and taking thence a number of letters and a few trifling articles, he placed them in his pocket, and going noiselessly out of the house, he proceeded to the stable, brought forth his horse, jumped into the saddle, and took his way to Dublin. It was near mid- night when he reached the rendezvous upon the Dublin quay, and knocking at the door he was admitted"by Nelly Blossom, and soor found himself in company with his boor, companions who awaited his coming in the back room. t"Well Pat," he said, as he threw himself into a chair, " is everything in readiness to start at a moment's notice ." "It is," answered Pat, " all the thrunks an' luggage, an' other farafernalias are aboord, and all we have to do is to mut our bodies in the same place, up wid the anchor, an' off." "So far, so good," said Bernard, as he proceeded to pull out the forged check and the stolen will.-"Do you see that docu. ment?" he continued, as he presented the former paper for Pat's inspection. "I do," answered that individual. "Well, that's a check upon the bank of Ireland for five hundred pounds-does it look like a good one ." 'Peon me sowl it does look like a very good wan," answered Pat,"' an' divil a doubt I'd have iv it at all, iv it was any wan bud yersilf that held it." : "Well, it isn't a good one," said Bernard, "it's a forgery-I took it into my head to i draw upon the old gentleman for that amount, and as I did not wish to put him to the trouble of filling up a check, 1 did it myself." r "Sure it isn't your intintion to send me to the Bantik wid it!" exclaimed Pat, with a i frightened expression of countenance, 3  Do you think I'm crazy?" asked Ber- i nard, with a contemptuous look; "I might t as well inform them at once that the check - was spurious, as to send you with it. Ne, i no, I merely show it to you to let you and I Bill Stark see that we do not start without - means. I1 do not apprehend the least danger e in presenting it, although it is a pretty large B sum, for I am well known at the Bank aa - the son of Robert Wilson, and I have pre- 3 sented genuine checks for smaller amounts d an hundred times. To-morrow afternoon I   dhall get it cashed, and to-morrow night we shall hoist anchor and away. I did intend to leave you behind, Bill," he said, address- ing ,Stark, * to keep me informed of how matters progressed here, but I have come to the conclusion that your company would be indispensable on our arrival in New-York, for I shall need somebody to pilot me around the city, and to learn me the ins and outs there. So I have made arrangements with another party, here-Dr. Stykes-who will keep an eye about, and drop me a line occa- sionally, and I shall expect the pleasure of your company.' "Well, there's one thing I've got to tell you before we start," answered Bill, which is, that it's very little traveling around New- York I can do, for I am '-wanted' there, and have been these six years. I can direct your movements, and may, perhaps, venture out occasionally; but even then. it must be in disguise, for there are certain benevolent gentlemen there who would perhaps insist upon offering me board and lodging for no- thing, if they knew me." '  "That's the difficulty, is it?" inquired Bernard, with a laugh--" why, what did you do, to make the kind gentlemen you allude to, so solicitous about your welfare?"  ' "Well, I met a gentleman one night who had plenty of money,-in a dance-house in Water-street, and persuaded him to take a walk with me-he was a little in liquor, and I wished to get him sober. At my request, ; he handed me his money to keep for him till 1 he should come to his right senses, and then I we strolled down to the foot of the wharves: v It was a very dark night-there was nobody I near us--and while we were looking off the ' end of the dock at the gaslights which were d sining in Brooklyn, on -the other side of the 1 river, he lost his balance and fell into the 1 water. As I said before, there was no help a at hand; and as I could not rescue him my- a self, I thought I wouldn't say anything i about it. The man's body was found float- ing in the river some few days afterwards, i and because a stevedore recognized him, and 1 remembered having seen him in my compa- m ny on the evening he was missing, suspicion 1 arose in the minds of some persons that I f! had pushed him overboard, for the purpose of retaining possession of his money. O, s i, you've no idea what a place New Yfork is h -there's no such thing as justice there-if o there was, I shouldn't be here at present, I c ssure you,"   - .          a "That's the place for ne!" cried Pat, b sxultingly, " that's the very place I want to E go to-the way I won't have justice done tl me, be fme sowl, they're too fond iv doing h justice to a felly here, so they are!"  - Well, I'm of the opinion I shall be an X Apt scholar," remarked Bernard, "and 1 c don't think it will be necessary, for you to w upose yourself much on my accour.- The h   re experience I have had in traveling in Dub., d lin, Cork, Belfast, and London, will aid;,m g- some, I make no doubt, for all large cities w must be nearly alike in many, particulars. o So that's all fixed; and now, then, to-settle e with Nelly." He rose from his chair as he ;, finished speaking, and approaching the door, d he called out "Nelly!"That delectable s young lady soon made her appearance, when h Bernard infoyrmed her of his intention to sail "the following day. -  "Well, I suppose you have not forgot your indebtedness to me," said Nelly, signi-, ficantly. 1  "No, indeed!" answered Bernard, "it h was to speak to you concerning that matter, -that I called you. How much, now," he I continued, chucking her under the chin and t smiling graciously-" do you consider youa have earned ." O "It's impossible for me," she answered, t  "to fix a value- upon my services; I must ; leave that to your generosity." t "Will fifty pounds pay you " asked Bernard. l "Well, yes," was the reply, "I should say that fifty pounds would pay very weH for such a job, and I'd like to have a few more at the same price." "-You may have, one of these days," said Bernard, " if you're a good girl and behave yourself. Tn the meantime, after 1 am gone, I wish you would take a trip into Kildare, occasionally, and if you see or hear of any- thing there which you think will interest me, I- wish you would make a note of it. I'll write you word where to direct a letter to me when I get to my journey's end. Dr.. Styke's will be on the look out for me, too; you need not fear to converse freely with him, if you wish to consult him at any time he is one of us. I must he off to bed, now and to-morrow, before going on board, I will give you the fifty pounds I have prom- ised you." "All right!" said the degraded creature, in a tone of the greatest satisfaction, as she, left the room, with Bernard following her;, while Pat Flanders, Bill Stark, and the boy Tim, stretched themselves out upon the; floor, and fell into an uneasy slumber. The next morning Bernand Wilson was, stirring betimes, and at about 10 o'clock,. having personally superintended the taking on board the vessel in which he and his- companions intended to sail a number of articles necessary for the voyage, which had, before been overlooked, he left Flanders, Stark, and the boy Tim, in the cabin, giving them strict injunctions to remain there til- he should complete his business on shore, when he said he would be with them agaimn He then went on deck, and approaching the captain-a coarse, brutal-looking felow, who spoke- with a strong German accento. he intimated to him that- he should wish ti /       '          t  &#xD;<pb n="64-65 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC7813-00000034"/> 1Sl about five- o'clock, and jumping into a pil yawl boat he was pulled ashore by a couple of of sailors who were in waiting for him, and fro took his way to the bank of Ireland. He sp succeeded in getting the cheek cashed, for, th( as he himself had observed, his countenance the was familiar at the Bank, and there was of scarcely one of the officers of that institu- lie tion who had not, at one time or other seen vi him there. Having received the money, he re bent his steps towards the Dublin quays, br and having put Nelly in possession of the Sc reward he had promised her, he bade her w. good-bye, repeated his request that she cc should keep a bright look-out for iuforma- at tion that might be interesting to him, and by n the time night had thrown her sable pall over g the city of -Dublin, the murderer, robber, tiU and conspirator, and his boon companions, C were on their way to          ta "The land of the free and the home ofthe brave." : re rfo tl CHAPTER' XV.     .   t IS the latter end of 1847, many of the v most prominent leaders of the Irish people ti became dissatisfied with the doctrines put t forth at Conciliation Hall, considering them r too tame, and as O'Connell tad on many oc- t casions, in the opinion of a- number of the t malcontents, retracted his most solemn as- 8 severations, and broken-his vows of unswer- 1 ving fidelity and patriotism, they began to a think for themselves, and it was whispered r among them that O'Connell did not exactly t mean what he said, whilst others, looked  upon his political teachings as " a mockery,. a delusion, and a snare," from which nothing f good or beneficial to the. cause of Ireland a could ever emanate. Prominent among the I dissatisfied were such glorious men as Mea- gher, Mitchell, Martin, O'Brien, Doheny, O'Dogherty, Duffev, and last though not least, Father Kenyon, of Templederry no- toriety. Accordingly these patriots met, and form- ing themselves into a confederacy, they designated themselves "Young Irelanders,I in contra-distinction to the "Old Irelanders," with O'Connell and his " moral suasion" principles at their head--whilst they, (the # Young Irelanders,") repudiating such doc- trines, determined upon making the attempt to achive by " unawed rebellion" what they regarded as their inalienable rights. Cir- aulars were printed, and sent through the wiesthood to almost every parish in Ire- land-Clubs were organized, named after their leaders--a committee was formed in Dublin, who met in their Club Rooms in Westmoreland street, and framed rules and regulations for the guidance of the -various subordinate ones-ars were purehased- ' *.   pikes were manufactured-sand the memteos of the Clubs were drilled by old pensioners from the British army---and thus, before the spring of '48 was far advanced, the leaders of the ' Young Ireland" party numbered in their ranks, if not all, at least the majority of the patriotic spirits of the country. Pub. lic meetings were held at the Music Hall-' violent speeches were made, which found a ready response throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, but particularly in the South and West, and the Secret Committee, who managed all, the private affairs, of the confederacy, met nightly at their rooms, and at length definitely decided upon a simulta- neous rising, not later than the ensuing Au- gust. Their reason for deferring it to that time was, their 'want of funds to provide X Cbmmissariat Department sufficient to main- tain the Irish army during the winter cam- paign. This deficiency, they determined to supply by seizing upon the, harvest, when reaped, and gathering it into X various depots, for the purpose of storage, and it was to this fact that Haviland alluded in his letter to Eveleen, when he remarked " that the crops which the coming Autumn would ripen would belong 4to the peasantry, and not td their masters." The chief object of the pa- ttriots was to keep the intended period of rising a perfect secret, so that ttey might -take the British troops unawares; but in 3this most important point of all, they were -signally defeated by British gold. Col. -Brown, the Chief Commissioner, who had a at his disposal a horde of detective police, I made them subservient to the cause of royal- r ty by bribing them (to their eternal shame 1 and disgrace be it spoken!) to gain admit- ,r tance into the various Clubs, as Delegates g from the- country, and there learn and divulge d all the movements of the Young Ireland e party--so that there was not a meeting or L- secret consultation held, the object- and re- sult of which was not as well known 'tothe )t Government as to the confederates theme, I- selves-and it was this secret intelligence which enabled the Government to anticipate l- the Irish party, and, as it were, to goad on y poor O'Brien and his brave companions to ? their ruin, well knowing that the country "was not then prepared to support them. It i" would serve no purpose here to recapitulate le the painful detailsiof the many causes which c- led to the overthrow and total destruction of pt one of the most justifiable attempts at revo. ay lution that ever happened in any age of the ir- World. The ugineipal circumstances must ie still be fresh in the recollection of all true e- lovers of liberty and human rights, for scarc er ly yet has the wail of disappointment and in sorrow which arose from twenty millions of in free Americans when the lamentable truth nd of Ireland's failure reached them across the us Atlantic died away. Suffice it to say, that -- shortly after Bernard Wilson and lId bamr  ?'-  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7813-00000035"/> confederates sailed, the chains of bleeding Erin were only rivetted stronger by the cap- ture and incarceration on a charge of high treason, of some of fier brightest, best, and most patriotic sons. It was some two weeks before Robert Wilson-who had himself secretly favored the movements of the Young Ireland party, although an ardent admirer of O'Connell-- became aware of the fact that his son had been guilty of the terrible crime of forgery. At first, although he had long ceased to look fir anything good from Bernard, he could scarcely believe that his son was so far lost in infamy as to commit a forgery upon him while he lay stretched upon a bed of sick- ness. When, however, this fatal truth, oon- . bined with the intelligence of the failure of his long-cherished hope of the liberaion of Ireland, was made apparent to him, he came  near sinking under the anguish which over-  whelmed him, and it was many months be- I fore he rallied sufficiently to rise from his bed. E During his . entire sickness, Eveleen  watched over him with the tenderest solici- a tude--his every wish was anticipated by her, a and 8o devoted was she in her attentions to t him, that the Joss of her regular rest, taken n in connection with her own sorrows, so v preyed upon her naturally delicate constitu- u tion, that she became a mere wreck of her h former self, and looked as though she was 1 fast falling into the grave. The old man e; witnessed this change in the appearance of tt his niece, with alarm,for he now regarded w her as the prop of his old age-his nurse in p sickness-his consoler in sorrow-the apple si of his eye. Nor was Mrs. Jackson less sl apprehensive than Mr. Wilson for the safe- he ty of hel darling adopted child, and she I strove by every means in her power to en- da liven her and to chase from her mind the o sad thoughts which continually depressed gr her. Six months had passed away since c she had received the last letter from Havi- d land, and during the whole of that long pe- fo riod the poor girl was a prey to the most as agonizing thoughts. She strove hard to ex follow the advice which her lover had given wt her-to keep a brave heart, and hope for the- ce best ;- -for a long time she tried to appear wi li(vly, but "hope long deferred maketh :the ho ^rt sick, and many a tear did she shed cl( in the solitude of her chamber, and many a H bitter sigh escaped her breast when none  were by to notice it.         lip. At length, Mr. Wilson, having entirely thu recovered from his severe indisposition, was not advised by the doctor to try what effect a ho change of scene would have upon the health slij of his niece, and he accordingly informed ma Eveteen, one fine day, of his intention to you mate a short excursion through some of the few rural districts of Ireland, expressing a wish we at the same time that she should accompany ing hits it^   ling  "If you wish it, uncle," she said, when *ap- the farmer broached the matter, " 1 will go igh with you, but 1 had much rather stay here, and for there is not an old familiar object in the neighborhood that does not remind me of )ert him, and when I think that perhaps I may red never see him again--O, uncle, dear uncle, rty, what a fearful sound there is to me in that I- little word, never!-I feel that the wide ad world owns no scene which could appear so ry. lovelysto me as this, the green earth no ep'ot ,ok where I could so contentedly lay me down ld and die.

They had not been absent more than three ag weeks, when BEveleen's health apparently E getting worse instead of better, they took tui their way home again, and the very day fix after their return to Kildare, a letter from sh Haviland arrived. Eveleen wept and ha 'laughed by turns when she received it, and m was so much excited that it was some time ag before she could compose herself qufficiently to read it. When she did succeed in some- br what tranquilising her feelings, she broke w the seal, and a smile of joy settled upon her bE care-worn features as she glanced over the a first few lines which informed her that her pi lover was alive and well. The letter was hN dated on ship-board, it having been brought D * to Ireland by a transient vessel, and Havi- tl land wrote that he was much better con- 1a tented than he thought he could have been li -that he had attracted the attention of one m of the assistant-surgeons of the ship, to if whom he had told his story-that from this tl gentleman, who believed his narrative and t sympathised with him, he learned many ji things concerning the government of 'the t penal colony of which he was not aware-  that he had no doubt, even should he be t Afored to staytlthe full time for which he was c transported, that in the course of a short i time, he should be able to obtain what was termed a ticketiof leave, which would en- able him to labor for himself and secure to hitn privileges of which he would otherwise 4 be deprived. He wound up his letter by again urging upon Eveleen the necessity of preserving a tranquil frame of mind, and ex- pressing a full belief that his innocence would ere long be made manifest, stating at the same time, that till such was the case, he should neglect no opportunity of writing to her, and informing her of every little in- cident worth mentioning, "you need not, dear Eveleen," he wrote, " feel any anxiety for me, if you do not receive letters regu- larly, for I have made arrangements by which, should anything happen to me, you will be informed of it. Keep up your spi- its,' for I feel as certain that we shall be happy yet, as I do that 1 am at present Eveleen was filled with joy when she had finished the perusal of the letter. "What a tutor is adversity to teach con- tentment and patience!" she exclaimed *'when there was tothing to keep bin   from me, I could not bear that he Should be a moment out of my sight,. and now that he is thousands of miles away from me, I cannot help but weep with joy and grati- tude on the receipt of a letter from him. Mother, she continued, as she folded the letter up, put it in her bosom, and started for the house. of Mrs. Jackson, "this will be joyful news for you, and I must hasten to put vou in possession of it." Not'many weeks passed -before the rose again made its appearances on the cheek of Eveleen, her eye assumed more of its na-' tural brilliancy, and her step became more firm and elastic. The great length of time she had been forced to wait for a letter had taught her patience, and she had deter- mined in all future time to "hope even against hope." We must now take a look on board the brig Sea-Gull--the name of the vessel on which Bernard and his companions had em- barked. She had reached New York after' a voyage of about twenty days, and having rpassed through quarentine, Bernard had her towed to one of' the wharves on the t North river. I should have stated before - that Bernard has purchased the brig in Ire- -land, put on board a small cargo of Irish I linens, broadcloth, and other mnerchandize, e which he intended to disposeof here, and o it was then his purpose as he could not sell s the vessel unless to some one who would d1 trade with her in some portion of Her Ma- y jesty's dominions, to find a customer for e her in some Merrimack lumber merchant. - Accordingly he disposed of her cargo, and e the German captain whom he had placed in ,s command of her was not long ip finding a At purchaser for her. s  "Now then," said Bernard, after all this a- business had been satisfactorily arranged, to " here we are in this much talked-of land se of liberty. What's to do next, Bill ." . My "Well, the first thing to .be donb, /now, Df said Stark, " is to get a place to stow our- x- selves away in.. The best thing you can ce do will be to put up at some one of the at hotels in Broadway--the Howard is about as ;e, good as any, I guess--under the name of ng Smith or Jones or anything that happens to n- suit your fancy. Pat Flanders; the boy ot, Tim, and myself, will put up at one of the ity emigrant boarding-houses in Greenwich- ,u- street, where we will stay till you are able by to hire .and furnish a house, when the best Lou plan will be to hire a housekeeper- -I will pi- get one of the right stamp--one that can be be depended upon in cases of emergeneyt-- ent and we will all live together. In selecting a house, you had better get one on the ouvt she skirts of the city somewhere-say Third Avenue, pretty well up-and be as q'ick on- about it as possible, for the sooner we are ed; together the better. For my parth I must him keep myself pretty shady, until I ean get a s    fitting, #diguise, fr. I do not consider an in- troduction to the keeper of a. certain granite building in Centre-street, at all desirable. You will soon, if you keep your eyes about you, become familiar with the city, and in the course of a few days, when I get my new- rig on, I shall be able to accompany you occasionally, when it will not take long to " learn you the ropes." Stark then gave Bernard directions how to find the hotel he had mentioned, and giving him the number of the house in Greenwich-street at which he himself intended to put up, he told him to call there the next morning, and bidding Pat and the boy follow him, he took leave of- Bernard, and bent his steps towards Greenwich-street. CHAPTER XVI. VERY few of the sleek, well-fed, pious ladies and gentlemen who every once in a while astonish the world by having paraded in the columns of our newspapers the dona- tion of large sums of money towards the support of already immensely wealthy insti- tutions, have any idea of the enormities fre- quently practised in the generally filthy es- tablishments known as emigrant boarding- houses, so numerous in the streets skirting the eastern-and western shores of New York. They (the benevolent class of citizens afore- said) are content to have themselves rolled to church in their carriages on the Lord's Day, notwithstanding the prohibition con- tained in the third, commandment; and there, seated in their cushioned pews, either cosily sleep or "idly ruminate" with the word of God in their ears and the voice of Mammon in their hearts-They are content to contribute money towards the purchase of spiritual food for the heathen or the re- tention il office of a horde of high-salaried lazy vagabonds; but the idea of feeding the hungry or clothing the naked wretches that meet them at every turn on their way to the house of God, never enters their heads. Nor are they the only class of persons who , ate blind to scores of glaring evils which exist in our midst. There are many really benevolent, well-to-do, but careless persons among us, who on meeting. in the streets a case which excites their sympathies, will put ltheir hands in their pockets, bestow a trifle, pass on, and forget the next moment all about it; They never refleet that these are only individual cases-that there are, in  certain Sections of the city, scores of sickly. half-famished, perishing human beings, hud- dlsd together like so many beasts-men, women, and children, who havingjsucceeded, aftr flying frori starvation and tyranny at home, in reaching our shores, are beset, on landing by a crowd of rapacious human   wolves, who strive by every imaginable ar. tifice and trick to rob them of any little pro- perty which they may have been fortunat ; enough to bring with them, having succeeded i in which damnable crime, they send them adrift upon the community ce turn them over to the tender mercies of the Ten Governors, who generally manage to accommodate them eventually with an .abiding place, in the shape of six feet of earth, on Potter's Field. Few, indeed, there are, who are aware of the outrages to which the unfortunatelinmi- grant is subjected in these dens., Her*, not unfrequently, young girls who are on their way to some country town where they may h ave relatives-fathers, mothers; brothers or sisters, who expect them-are either en- ticed into some den of infamy, and there ruined, by the soulless scamps who are ever on the look out for them, or are forcibly violated in their beds, at the dead hour of the night, in the establishment at which they put up; and there is no redress for them, for they are strangers here-friendless, and with the exception of barely money enough, per- haps, to carry them to their journey's end, penniless.  If, in the extremityof .their an- guish, they venture to speak to any one of the great wrong which has been done them,. it is more than likely they will be laughed at for their pains, and told that they " mustn't mind such things, they are of very common occurrence, and they'll got used to them if they stay here long en6ugh."' It often happens, that under such circum- stances, the girl will, in the absence of all sympathy, become hardened and reckless, and when the relative who expects her, alarmed at her delay, comes to the city to seek for her, he will find her an inmate of some brothel, a home which has been kindly furnished her by the dastardly, contemptible wretch, whose prey she has become. On the  morning -following the day on which Bernard parted with his companions to put up at the Howard Hotel, Pat Flan- ders might have been seen in the bar-room of an emigrant boarding-house inGreenwich- street, familiarly chatting with a number of gossoons from  the " oulld sod," while, Bill Stark sat moodily apart, With his hat drawn close over his eyes, and the boy Tim at his side. "Show uz the dudeen," said Pat, as -he, without ceremony, took a short pipe from the hand of one of the " finest pisanthry," drew it across the cuff of his coat, and in- serted it in his mouth. ("So it's frim Bel- fast ye are P' he continued, as he sucked away at the black stem of the unsavory piece of clay with a  smacking noizeand -blew a cloud of smoke before him. "Yis," answered the man, a stout, good- looking young fellow, "I've an uncle an'.a cousin in New York somewhere, an'ia/-ilf and me sisther Judith kem here to fin' hi ,",       Q    r  -  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7813-00000037"/> "How long are you afther comin' over?" h inquired Pat.             h "' About a wake," was the response. g "An' ye di-a't fin' thlm, yet " said Pit, t inquiringly.             g /"The divil a find," answered the Itish- t man; * bud a gintleman in the sthreet tould h me iv I'd put an advertisement in the Sun, s I'd find him; so he showed me where the g office was, an' I put'wan in yistherday, an' h I expict he'll be- here to-day.

"Iv he lives till next spring," said the elder jof the two, "I'll have the entire party over here, so I will." "The ould man 'll niver come, Uncle," \ said the nephew, with a mournful expression. of countenance; '"he ses he couldn't die happy away from Ireland; he was willin' that we should come, because he sed we wor young, and could return again iv we didn't like it here; bud he'll niver come him- *elf, Uncle, hiver!"

I go an' git a cart to remove yezi"Then turning to the landlord -a bull-necked. red- haired, animal-looking -Englishman, who \ stood behind the' counter, complacently re. garding the scene, he said, " what's to pay here, landlord?" "I'll tell you, presently," .said that indi- vidual, as he took a pen from an inkstand in front of him, and began figuring up on a dirty sheet of foolscap paper. He spent some fifteen minutes at this-employment, and at length handed over his bill, with t'0--- remark, " it will be just thirty-five dollars and twenty-three cents." "Thirty-five dollars an' twinty-three cints for a wake's board an' lodgin', for two, in sich a beautiful establishment as this j" said the uncle, as he raised his hands as though i surprised at the extreme reasonableness of. [the charge--" an' is that all! Couldn't you make it a little more? Sure I don't want i to rob ye!" "That's my price," said the landlord, testily, " and you shan't remove a thing from here till it's paid-you may rest assured of i that." "Shan't I now?" said the uncle, as he. I lugged forth a greasy-looking wallet from the side pocket of his coat and took out a I ten dollar bill-" may be you'll give -us a B resate in full for that," he continued, as he r held it towards the landlord. D  "May be I won't do any such a d-d e thing!" said the landlord-"I've stated my e terms, and I want you either to settle or e clear out." d  You won't take no less?" said the Irish- 1 man, as he put the bill back from whence he , had taken it.     - d  "Not a penny," replied the landlord. I' "Well, wait a bit, James," said the Irish- ;, man, addressing his nephew, "sit down an' make yersilf comfortable for a few minutes - -I'll be wid ye agin directly," and he hur- d riedly-took his ideparture. He had not bein e gone more than twenty minutes when he re. y turned in company with. a short, thick-set, well-dressed, fniddle-aged gentleman, who, e though evidently an American by birth, bore y in his countenance unmistakeable evidences of Irish origin. He was a good-looking' "man with red cheeks and large bright eyes, n. but the comtmonest observer could not fail. e to perceive that he was of an impulsive, ex-. a, citable temperament, and one who would e not easily abandon an undertaking. e  Walking up to the landlord, and regarding i- him sternly for a moment, he enquired-+ "How long have these people boarded '- with you t"  is The la :lord east his eyes upon the floor,   and answered hesitatingly, "I don't know that's any of your business." "1am going to make it my business, said the litle . man, bringing. his, fist down upon the counter with a force that made the de canters and glasses dance again, " and if You give me another word of your imperti- nence, you d-d heartless scoundrel, I'll jump down your throat! How long, I ask you-" but here he appeared to have lost all patience, and checking himself, and turning to the un-le, who stood looking on with a bioad grin upon his countenance, he' said-- Mr. O'Brien, point out your baggage." Mr. O'Brien did so. "N-ow " said the little man, "take it out upon the iide-walk, call a carman, and cart it off! I'll take the responsibility!" The uncle and nephew took hold of a big 1 chest, and were about carrying it towards the door, when the landlord, who up to this : time, had stood perfectly dumbfoundered, 1 shouted out "Thomas i John! William '  but almost before the last name had passed his lips, the little man cleared the counter at c a bound, seized him by the hair of the head,  got his neck in that position termed by prize- h' fighters " chancery," and before he could be I taken off from him, had beaten his face al- t most to a jelly.  (Now," he said, addres  sing :the landlord, as he himself grabbed ti hold of the last chest, and helped to pull it to the cart, while Thomas, John and Wil- a liam, who had obeyed the call of their mas- ter, stood looking on. as if frightened to v death, " when you wish a settlement of this. r little affair, you always know where to find S me."  The little man then waited till he saw the uncle, nephew and niece fairly star- . ted, when he tookl his departure in the direc- f tion -of the battery.          b "That's a  smart little felly," said the nephe,w, as they started off, " but won't he get himself in throuble wid the landlord ." B ' The divil a  bit," answered the uncle te it's a shippin merchant he is, an' he knows tu enough about that thafe o' the worl' to hang him, 'll be bound-it's well enough I ie lan'lord knows it, too, niver fear."  he Leav'g the cart upon which the emigrants were seated to'pursue its way up town, let us now  again return to the bar-room. I, "I-r wonder where the devil Wilson can be!" muttered Stark, in a low tone, as Pat Be took a seat alongside of him-" it's time he was here--I hope he has not allowed him- hai self to be drawn  into any bad snap. It's faa necessary I should see him this moring-- - I wish to give him some instructions---after Be which I must play sick for-the day, and lay fai] in bed, for it won't do for me to be seeu gai about till I have procured a disguise."   X "Sphake iv the divil an' 1 is imps will ap- ma pea  r i" said Pat, as Bernard entered at the sai l door and approached them.  .     hin "Good morning, boys!" he exclaimed, 9   ow "how do you feel this morningS  How is it with you, Pat?" aid ".

Then turning to the boy Tim, he continued- "and how did you sleep, Timmy?" "I didn't shape at all!" answered the hopeful youth.         '  "And why didn't you?" asked Bernard "Ifkept awake, the way I might-see cud I sthale anything," was the answer. "And did you steal anything," .nquired Bernard.  "Yis," answered the boy,  as he put his hand in his pocket, and took forth an old- faahioned English bull's-eye watch. "And where did you steal thist" said Bernard, whose malignant features grew fairly purple with suppressed rage as he re- garded the boy.         + "I shtole it from anundher the pilly o' a man that shipt in the same room wid me, te said the boy, in a frightened tone, as he took himself out of the reaoh of Bernard. -- Didn't I  tell you," said Bernard, "that  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7813-00000038"/> Ird kill you if you attempted to steal any- ne, t'ig without my permisslon . t; Sure. cuAn't help it," said the boy, " it Ber was so convanient!"         em 4' Do you want to get us all in trouble by del the paltry theft of a five dollar watch, when mx we have so large a game to play" said to. Bernard, in an enraged but suppressed tone m --- here, come with me and show me the vii man from whom you stole- it."     bu Tim led the way to the room where he fal had slept, where the owner of the watch--a  burly Scotchman-was swearing about the bl loss of the missing article, and charging the as theft thereof upon an Irishman who had th slept in the same bed with him. Bernard It approached the man, and after, with as inuch m suavity of manner as he could assume, in- forming him that Tim was the son of a friend of his, who had placed him under his charge, w he expressed his sincere regret that any- thing of the kind should have happened, and a forced the boy:to restore the watch, giving c him, as he did- so, sundry- severe clouts on the side of the head, with a promise, that if E he was again guilty of such an offense, he g should hand him over to the authorities. n This satisfactorily settled the matter, and E Bernard, seizing Tim by the collar, led him t jck to his companions.        a "I tell you what it is, Wilson," said Stark, X as Bernard approached him, "something ( must be done, and that very suddenly. for I can't live in this way-I am liable to be de- tected at any moment while 1 stay here-- I've seen no less than three of my particular friends with stars upon their coats already, and if any accident should expose me to their gaze in my presentdress, I'm a goner. We must get a house immediately, and I've hit upon a plan that I think will help us." "What is it ." inquired Bernard. "I am acquainted with a certain lady who Keeps a house in Mercer-street," said Stark, who, I think, will aid us. When I left here six years ago, we were not very good friends, for -' was rather ' hard up' at the time, and one night I took the liberty of appropriating to my use certain articles of jewelry belong- ing to her, for which she has never been paid. I think now, however, if she is made aware ot +he fact that I have plenty of mo-   ney, and am willing to pay hr witL interoS we shall have no difficulty m' enlisting her services. I know that she has those in her employ-respectable people, too, soosonsi- dered-who could obtain a house for us at a moment's notice; and my plan is to visit her to-night, and make the necessary Arrange- ments. I wish you would, towards evening, visit some wig maker's establishment, and buy a black, bushy wig, and a pair of black false whiskers And mustachios-these with a little penciling of my eyebrows, and the black suit of clothes which I wore when I appeared as the prosecutor of Haviland, I think, will render my disguise complete. IIn the meantime, I will gc to bed, and. re-- L main there till you call for me." "I like your plan well," said Bernard, "and will attend to my part of the business , without fail." -  And f hat are Timmy and mesilf to do d all day?" said Pat Flanders. "Sure we g can't sit here and suck our fingers." n  "There's no necessity for that," replied F Stark: " there's nothing to prevent you from e going where you please-take down the ,. number of this house and street, and if you d get lost, anybody will show you the way n here. But be careful that you don't get into any difficulty-go where you please, and k, ask as many qulestions as you please, but g don't answer any and above all things, I keep ybur eyes upon this d-d young Irish e- hound, and see that he don't steal anything. - I'm sorry Bernard brought him along with ar us, for if we d6n't break him of his propenm y, sity, he will certainly get us into difficulty." to  "If he does," said Bernard, grating his or. teeth, and scowling fearfully upon the boy, ve "I'll beat his brains out, and grind every d-d bone in his body into powder! .

CHAPTER XVII. TEB two worthies mentioned at the end of the last chapter, walked leisurely along Greenwich street making comparisons, as each novel sight presented itself, between New York and D ublin, till they had reached the only public piece of ground worthy the name of a public promenade, to be-found in the city. Pat pushed open the first gate he came to, and was about entering, when -a smooth-faced, genteel-looking individual, dressed in a suit of black clothes, and a white choker, held out his hand, with the remark- "Fare,  sir---fifty cents for yourself-- twenty-five cents for boy---seventy-five cents in all---free walk all around, then, wherever you please." "An' d'ye call that fair?" answered Pat, as he regarded the man with a look of ming- led astonishment and suspicion. "Be me sowl, I niver hard iv a charge for entherin' a park in the ould counthry, an' I don't think it's fair atall, so I don t---but sure," he re- marked, as the banging to of the gate above attracted his attention, and' two gentlemen passed in without let or hindrance, "there i goes two that's afther passin' in 'widout pay- i ml'---why don't you shtop thim 2" "Yearly subscribers," answered the indi- c vidual, mildly---" pay their rates yearly--- p if you want to subscribe for a year, twenty o dollars---give you a receipt in full." Just at this time the gentlemanly gat, h keeper observed a policeman walking toward d him, and suddenly turning to leave, he oJB d served--- "But you can pass in this time for no- Abe thl'ng---T woyld't grant the same privilege to do everybody, but you look like an honest, good- dE natured fellow, and I, won't be hard on you. cc You needn't say anything about it to that an gentleman with the piece of brass on his o0 coat, though---he's one of the keepers, and kr if he finds out that I've passed you gratis, he'll not only make you pay, but he'll report ap me to head-quarters.

He allowed them to pass him by, when, turning sud- denly, lhe dropped a pocket book front be. hind at Tim's feet, and immediately began scrabbling for it, as though fearful that Pat would get it first. i' Is dis your pocket book, bossy?" he asked, as he held-ittowards Pat. '"Perhaps it is, an' perhaps it isn't, answered the latter. "Show us-is there any money in it?" tre Joe opened it, and Pat observing that it was filled with bank notes, continued-- "Will,. upon me word an' credit, bud that's lucky-it is mine, an' yer an honest filly.

"I thought I seed you drop it myself," said Joe, "L but I wasn't sure. Here it is, bossy-now wot you gwine to give me for  findin' it " " The willingness of the,negro to give it  up at on'ce, excited suspicions in the mind  of Pat that everything was not right.  Being dishonest himself, he did not at all  believe in the honesty of others, so taking  the wallet in his hand, a bright idea seemed  to strike him, as he remarked-    I "Well, you are an honest filly, an' I'll 1 have to reward you.  Here," ,che said, taking a fifty dollar bill-the smallest, de- nomination yi the roll-from'ths pocket  book, "will that do ye ."  For a moment the negro looked blank, but instantly recovering himself, he re- marked, with a modest air-  / "Oh, bossy, dat's too much--couldn't- tink of takin' all dat money for bein' honest  -ten dollars 'll be plenty--don't want more'n ten dollars."

"Well," said the policeman, as he wit- nessed the termination of the affair-;- that Irishman 'll do to travel alone after he's been here a short time--I must keep track of him." Then approaching Pat, he said, "you didn't care about buyin' that pocket book, my friend ." "No, sir," answered Pat, with assumed dignity--' sure, honesty 's the best policy." , "I hope you'll always think so," said the policeman, "but why did you take posses. sion of the wallet?" "Whd the divil made you me father con- fessor." said Pat, with some asperity--- then addressing the boy, he continued: "Come, tTimmy, let's away back. Och, bud it's the quare paple they have in New York---the divil's paple, intirely!s and the two, after sauntering around for some time longer, taking a stroll upon the wharves among the shipping, and coming near being run over a dozen times by the differeht ve- hicles that throng such places during the day-time--made their way back to the place from whence they had started, pretty well tired out.   CHAPTER VIII. ON the night following the morning when the conversation between Stark and Bernard,  relative to the procurementof a house in which to domicile themselves, took place, those two individuals, in company with a female, might have been seen seated in a splendidly furnished apartment in a house in Mercer street. The latter was a woman about thirty vears of age ;-but the deep lines which a life of profligacy and dissipa- tion had mllarked upon her thin face, and which were visible to a close observer, even through the rouge and chalk with which her countenance was bedaubed, would have led one to suppose her considerably beyond that period in lite. She was of. slender make, and the unnatural brilliancy of her large, piercing black eyes, and the short dry cough, which occasionally broke from her, "told plainly enough that consumption had claimed her for its prey. She seemed to be aware of it, too, fobr occasionally when her cough was more troublesome than usual, she would refer to it with a blasphemous expression, winding up frequently with a laugh, (but such a laugh! it seemed like '" the echo of some yawning grave!") as she asserted that she had had a jolly life, if it was a short one. Her features were very regular, anrid she had doubtless once been oeautiful; but it was easy to perceive from her thin, bloodless lips, her restless, uneasy glances, and the reckless expression of her whole counten- , ance, that she was a slave to the very worst  passions. i"Yes, Bill," she said, addressing Stark- , but that individual, who in his new disguise would never have been taken for the person who an hour before was reclifiing upon his [ bed in the Emigrant boarding-house, cut hea ' short, with the remark- "Not Bill, now, if you please,Dolcy-- , Captain Canter, that's the ticket-it's not only more respectable, but safer--so Capt. Canter, if it's all the same to you."  "Well, then, Capt. Canter," said the : woman, who was generally addressed by Stark as Diolcy Jones, from the tact of her v having taken a fancy to, and frequently 3 humming a negro melody of that name- e " you did rather get the advantage of me on S that box of jewelry - there was about a 7 hundred and fifty dollars worth there." "O, not so bad as that, Dolce," answered e Stark, "I only got sixty for it, anyhoW." e ' Well, they cost me a hundred and sixty, 1I at all events," was the reply,-" and if I'd been going to sell them,sI wouldn't have taken a cejt less for them." "Well, well," remarked Staxrk, "we won't quarrel about that; you shall have your own price. But how about this house-do you think you can fix that for us ."   #lc anr do aaythingeovth mrney," repled Abe woman-".but nothing without it. I an get you a three-story brick house on the Third avenue, already furnished. to llirow, if you are walling to pay the price asked for it   ^  '" ". -" thprce .. "We shan't quarrel about the price," said Bernard Wilson, who up to this time had remained silent,"    ; but - ish you to under- ..^.t'S',         "- u is o loH! stand that I don't wish to occupy a house that has been tenanted by any other than-  respectable people. If you can get such a one, and furnish me with a tidy, exemplary housekeeper Who will mind her own busi- hess and ask no questions, you can fix your own terms." .               i "I hadn't the slightest idea,"ald the - woman, with a laugh, "of putting you in I any but a respectable house---the persons a who at present tenant the one I have in y view are of the first respectibility.-4.tfo gentlemen with their wives, who mix in the ' first       seelet  ,     5 firt society. I've an idea that it's rather a too expensive for them, and I dare say they will be glad to exchange it for a- residence tl which will not cost so much. As for the st house-beeper, the one wh6 is now in their ex service, is the very one you want, and I w have no doubt she will be glad to  remain cz with you. So if you are willing to pay hi fifteen hundred dollars rent, ou can take u pose'sion of it to-m orrow night."    sh "It's a bargain," said Bernard--', and ve now let's have some wine." The landlady rose and ringing a bell, she at gave orders to a black woman who answered po it, Xo fetch some wine, which was soon af- trswards brought and placed, together with 11ai glasses, upon a'table. ,'Now, then, Dolcy, said Bill Stark--- b f "you don't-expe  ct us to drink alone, do Col you?f,         e    ,     pe "O, no, by no means," answered the ac- his clommodating ]andlaffy---., you shall have a me dozen to help you. if you wish it." for "O, you are altogether .too kind," said.  Stark,---"I guessan addition of two to our Sta: company would   be quite sufficient---m ore Som would spoil company, wouldn't it, Jenks " then Bernard, who had!chosen the cognomen had of Harry Jenks, for the time being, an- ". swered that " he thought it would," upon know which the   landlady remarked , as she arose , oul to. leave the room, that they should have it man to suit the  mselves. . She then disappeared , 4  and shortly afterwards light footsteps were " 7 heard upon the stairs, and the next moment male a couple of young females made their ap- fectic pearance, One was about twenty-two years me tU of age, and had evidently followed her life sCien( o  f shame I on g enough  ; to hav e I ost every that f "rse   of d  elicacy--for her features wer e when m    arked by that reckless i ndifferene Whic h b etw c t  bo plainly c harac terize s the vic tim' of I un - . nad bridled   passions.

In this I did not think I should experience much d difficulty, but I soon became aware of the fact that I had mistaken her character, for although I knew she loved me devotedly-- nay, almost wildly-she was so firmly fixed in virtue that I found all my arts and dis- simulation powerless, and at length my de- sire to conquer being only increased by her determined opposition, I had recourse to a mock marriage. Her guardian was opposed to her keeping my company, for he knew I did not intend marriage; but after much persuasion on my part she was induced to consent to a clandestine marriage, and Pat Flanders played the part of priest. The ceremony was performed withoutwitnesses, and I kept her in ignorance of the true state of the case for six months after it took places I living at home during the timeand board- ing her at a hotel in Cork, whither I repaired every month and spent about a week at a time with her. At length I came across another face, nearer home, which took my fancy, and I began to grow tired of her, al- though I must admit I had no reason to, for she was ever ready to welcome me with a smile, and as I said before, her heart knew but one emotion, and that was love for me. I made -up my mind to get rid of her, how- ever, so I sent her a letter in which I made her acquainted with the fact that she was not my wife, and that we must hencefor- ward be strangers, but I told her at the same time that she might draw upon me as exten- sively as she liked in a pecuniary way'. By return of mail I received her answer, and I shall never forget it as long as I live. It was couched in terms as proud and as haughty as the Queen herself could have written, and every. word seemed to have been put down with a pen of fire. She in- dignantly rejected all my offers of pecuniary assistance, and wound up with a most soafhing, withering rebuke. I felt very bad about it for a time, but soon the other face of which I have spoken claimed my atte,- tion, and gazing upon that I lost all recol- lection of Nora. I made some inquiries about her some six months after, when I understoo4 that she had given birth to a daughter, and shortly after went away, no ne knew whither. I came to the conclu- sion that she had killed both herself and child, for that's the course most of them with whom I have had any dealings have pursued; and I heartily wish it had turned out so, for I fear she will be a thorn in my side now, whichI shall find it hard to et lid of. I have frequently forbidden Pat   ever to mention the I subject,forl've fieiver felt comfortable about it, and I suppose he will be as much surprised as 1 was when he ' finds out that she is not only living, but here among us." Bernard ceased his narration, and Bill Stark, drawing a long breath, exclaimed, drawling his words out deliberately-- "Well,.Wilson, you are a d--d scoun- drel, that's a fact. As you said awhile ago, it ain't necessary for me to tell vou that I ain't got much conscience; I've'committed murder in my time, bit d-n me if I con- sider it one half as bad as that. I'm equal to almost anything, but that 'knocks' me; d--n me if wouldn't allow myself to be torn to pieces by wild beasts before I'd be guilty of it! There's some credit in knocking a stout fellow on the head, because you run a risk; if you don't hit him hard enough to bring him down there's a chance that he may take your life, and you have to fight for it; but going after a portionless orphan girl, who has nobody to take her part, entrapping her into a mock-marriage and then deserting her, leaving her a foot-ball for the world to* kick about at pleasure, is so infernally con- temptible, so pitifully mean, so unmitigated. ly cowardly, that d--f me if I could a b'lieved that even you could have been guil- ty of it if you hadn't told me so yourself." "Come, come, Bill, I didn't expec such a show of virtuous indignation from you-1 think you have gone quite far enough." "Well," answered Stark, "I've spoken what don't often fall from my lils, the truth, and I couldn't help it." "The truth isn't always palatable," said Bernard, angrily, " not: even when it comes from a friend; and I hope in future you'll have a little more-respect for my feelings."' r The allusion to his feelings, by such a [ man as Bernard, was-too much for even t Bill Stark, and he could not repress a laugh I -at the idea. Checking himself at length, , however, he remarked in a conciliatory tone, "Well, well, I suppose upon the score of  feeling, if you come to the .rights of the r matter, we're about two and a pair. If you t had told me you had killed the girl, I don't I know as I should have thought so much of E it, for a life's a life, anyhow, and I s'pose - it's as sweet to a man as to a woman-but - there's a difference between a real death and 3 a living death; you eee, if you kill a woman [ outright, there's an end of the matter; but a if you pursue the course which you have ) done with this one, she may live for years - and yet suffer what's worse than death to I her every day of her life. Fact is, as far as i females are concerned, I've always?on- e sidered 'em dangerous property, and have i had as little to do with them as possiblebut f if I ever did allow myself to get one in such t a fix 1. think I'd be merciful and -kill her." -- "Then you would advise me -to -mt L.'    o .irl?" said Bernard, as a look of terrible meaning setBMd upon his features. No, no," said Stark, " not by any means * that would have been my advice if you had come to me at the start, before you let her know that she wasn't your wife, for then, I dare say, she wasn't afraid to die; but since that, you see, she's got into a kind of life that somehow or other makes 'em afraid to die. Even the hardest of 'em, although they may try to play offcareless, can't bear the idea of' goin' under.' Did you ever see one of 'em die?" he said, as he turned to- wards Bernard., "No," said Bernard, "I'm notf fond of thinking about death myself, much less look- ing at it." "Well," continued Stark, " if you're ever called to look at one when she's 'peggin' out,' I'd advise you to shut your eyes. I saw one die once, when I was on Black- -well's Island; it's a good many years ago, but it's as fresh in my recollection as if it was only yesterday. I'd rather kill twenty men than- look at such a thing again. She wasn't very old, abolt twenty-five I should suppose, but she'd lived mighty fast the last few years of her life, I tell you; in four- years, she'd passed through all the grades, from a palace to a hovel on the ' Points' that's what they'll have to come to at last,  you know, there's no getting away from it. i Well, this one--gallus Jane they called her -had been brought in about a week before 1 my term expired; she had been sent up as z a vagrant before, but this' time she was in c an awful state of filth and destitution, and the doctor said as soon as he saw her that r she wouldn't be much trouble to anybody t longs which proved to be the base, for she i died that same night. She was struck with s death about an hour before she breathed her i last; and during the whole of that time she s talked incessantly, sometimes she was sen- t sible, and sometimes she was raving mad. is When the lucid intervals happened, she'd ec talk to the doctor of things that happened co long years before, when she was a little girl, dr at her'home in Connecticut. She spoke to H him of her father and mother, and brothers A and sisters, calling them all bv name, and de wishing that she might see them before she he died. Once she said, ' Doctor, do you think sli Ood'll forgive me 1 I've been a very, very on Witcd woman, but I was good once.' Then, ed without waitin' for an answer, she'd begin go praying, 'Now I lay me down to sleep,' she said it was the only prayer she could ed remember, and she would have forgotten  l that, only her mother learned it to her when is she  put her to bed at night, when she was ajwe l. Then suddenly, her reason would ten N   eave her , and she'd imagine herself back on trar the -Points,' where they'd taken her from, far ind then such oaths, and blasphemous ex. Ito c pressions, and obscene talk as would fallmy   rible from her were shocking, even to me, becaue they came from the lips of a woman. She ans; would gnash her teeth, and while the white had froth came oozing through her bloated lips, her she would glare upon us with her crazy eyes In, I like a wild beast. After a while the parox- ince ysm would pass off, and then she would lay,  life panting for breath, and helpless as an infant d to upoi the bed, and beg the doctor to give her ugh something that would make her sleep'for- ,ear ever. She had a number of such turns a. . see this, and at last, in one of her crazy .fits. her to- strength was so great that she broke from the women who- were holding her, raised of herself on end, and as she clutched at their lok- faces with her long nails in her endeavors -to tear their flesh, she-fell back upon the bed ver a bloated, disgusting, almost putrid corpse, ;in' and wassholtljyafterwards tucked away in Potter's Field. You talk about murder, ck- eh "  said Stark, as he finished, "what's ' go, murder, compared with such a scene as that, f it I'd like to khow?" nty-.   u are highly entertaining to-night," ;he said Bernard, as a -cold chill ran all over uld him, " but you will oblige me, if you'll drop ast this subject and talk of something else." ,ur- "With- all ny heart," answered Stark, es, "I ain't particular, anything you like." . -r  ;' V Well, then," said Berfiard, " about this st, house; there's no doubt but what we'll get it. it, is there-?" , ler  "Not the slightest," was the answer, all * 're that's necessary fior me is to call upon Dotl as cy in the morning, plank the money, and we in can take possession to-morrow, after dark." nd, 'So. far,  so good," said Bernard, " and at now I  want you to have a conversation with dy that same Dolcy about ny fair cousin. I've he written to Dr. Stykes to intercept, if pos- th sible, one of Bill Haviland's letters to Eve- er  Been, enclose the same in an envelope, and he shnd it to me. He-will do it, I know.

I didn't like that At tranlaction I   was engaged in; helpinr'to carry off your cousin, but  I pledged myeVf ,to do it, and thought I was bound -to he*t 'my wordr-1I haveW't exactly relihed S  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7813-00000041"/> persecution of her all along, but I haven't a said anything about it because you helped t me when I was hard up, and I thought it I might seein ungrateful. I must tell you i now, though, I'd a good deal rather not go 1 any farther in the matter."      a "Well,d--n me!" exclain ,d Bernard, t in a tone of astonishment, " if you are not I turning preacher! But it won't do," he E continued, as he fixed a look full of malice Capon Stark, "you have gone too far in this business with me to back out now, aid we must -stand or fall together. If you attempt to play me false, I will denounce you to the police as a murderer." Bernard had mistaken his man, when he attempted to threaten Stark; for that indi- vidual was about as^free from any such feel- ing as fear as he was brlnful of villany, so fixing a look of the most undisguised contempt upon Bernard, he replied- "Well, Wilson, I did give you the credit of being a rather better judge bf character. What! have you known me all this time, and do you now attempt to frighten me by threats! I want you to understand one thing!" he continued, as he seized Bernard's arm, stopped him short in the street, and shook his forefinger deliberately in his-face, while he fixed upon him a look of the most determined ferocity-"I have lived in this world somewhat longer than you have, and in the course of my life I have faced Death in almost every form which he can take, both on land and at sea, and I have, never feared him. I expect to end my days upon the gallows-I- nev-er looked for anything better, for my father was hung before me--- but if ever you dare (and here he grasped Bernard's arm with such a force as to almost make him cry out) to' utter the, slightest breath to me again, that can be construed into a threat, d---n me if I don't cut your cowardly throat upon the spot, and I've a good mind to do it now!"As he ceased speaking his features exhibited the most tln- governable rage, and Bernard, who had not looked for any such result, trembled with fear from head to foot. "Forgive me, Bill," he said, at length, as he held out his hand, "I was hasty, and I beg your pardon." . "t Well, look out," said Bill, as he reluct- antly took his companion'soutstretched hand, "that you ain't hasty again, or it'll be worse for you." They walked along in silence for some time, when at length Bernard ventured to say--- "Well, if you won't assist me in this matter, at least you won't interfere with me, will you         ' "I don't know whether I will or ifot," answered Bill; " that's just as the humor takes me." Berrard saw that it would be useless t , t .,9   attempt a reconciliation with Bill at that  time, and as they had reached the Howard Hotel, they entered together, and Bill, hav- ing put down an assumed name on the books, left Bernard without even a 1" good night," and took his way to the room allotted to him, .his companion soon after following his example, and cursing himself for his im prudence. CHAPTER XIX. IT was on a clear, bright evening in the early autumn of 1850 that Eveleen Wilson, with an open letter before her, sat in the little room from which she had four years previously been so unceremoniously kid- napped by Pat Flanders.  The sun had some time disappeared behind' the western hills, the long European twilight had set in, , and so deep was the meditation of Eveleen, as she gazed from the window upon the ! beautiful scenery which surrounded her uncle's house, that "Night threw her mantle o'er the scene, t    And pinned it with a star," 3 almost before she was aware of it. A deep I sigh heaved the bosom of the young girl, ,a ! one by one the bright diamonds peeped forth , from tWe blue firmament to gem the dark- r ness, and when the last clump of bushes had 1 faded from her view, she covered her face , with her hands, and indulged in a passionate - flood of tears. She did not now, however," I mourn a lover lost to her in exile, for the t letter which she held in her hand intormed t her that he was well,safe and prosperous, I and' only awaited her coming in a land where r intolerance was unknown, where liberty I reigned supreme, and where the malice of I their enemies would be powerless. Although - she had not heard from him nearly a year, t previous to that morning, the intelligence I which she then received paid her for all the agony his long silence had occasioned. Up s to this time she could never bestow a thought [ upon any one else buthim, but now that she felt certain that he was not only at liberty, - but that she should soon again embrace him, , the idea that she was about to leave, per- 3 haps forever, all the dear scenes which as. sciation and habit had rendered sacred, e came upon her with stunning force, and it D was for this that she wept. Her uncle, who hid - long ceased to think of his profligate s son, and had fixed all his affections upon her, , could not bear the idea of parting with her, and yet he was not selfish enough to ask her, ' for his sake, to forego her purpose of flying to r one who would not only make her supreme- ly happy, but would be all to her that a t doting, childless uncle should be anti mom   than an uncle could be. It had consequent- lybeen a solemn day at the mansion, for not only had the old gentleman himself given way to grief, but all his dependents, and, in fact, everybody who had ever known Eve- leen, indulged in the general gloom, and as for Mrs. Jackson, she had wept till she had not a tear left to shed. The grief of poor old Biddy Ryan was very violent for a time, but she at length made up her mind to take the matter philosophically. "Och, whirra, whirra!" she exclaimed, after an immoderate fit of weeping, "I niver thought to part the colleen, bud iv she must go, she must, an' it isn't for the likes o' poor mortials like oursilves to be'questinin' the decraas o' Providence!" Eveleen wept long and bitterly, but she dried her tears at length, and risigo from her i -eat at the window, she began to disrobe I herself preparatory to retiring for the night. A heavenly expression of calm serenity had settled up6n her features, as, after having  performed her evening orisons, she laid her I head upon her pillow.  "Why  should I a weep ." she murmured, as she sweetly sank i to rest; " it is true I am called upon to leave f the familiar scenes of all my joys and sor- I rows, but for what do I leave them? Is it s not that I nmay By to one who contributed c more than all the world besides to make f those scenes precious to me  I go to a a strange land, but it will Pot seem strange to I me if he is there, for he is my world, and all k else would seem blank if he were taken from p me  for ever. Yes, dear Haviland," she td continued, as the silken lashes closed over d her mild blue eyes,           h "In exile thy presence shall still be lmy home, t And thine eyes make my climate wherever I roam.'"S The next morning Eveleen was up with al the lark, and at once commenced making a( preparations for her departure. Her uncle, tt conceiving that if they must part, it would fc be worse than useless to put off the evil day, ol proceeded immediately to Dublin, to have an th interview with an. old and tried friend of of his-a captain in the merchant service, by O the name of O'Reilly--under whose charge m he intended to place his niece. The bark w "  Dart," which the old' salt commanded, was wi then in port and was to sail in a week, and an Mr. Wilson, having waited upon him, stated of , his business, and received the assurance th from him that he would watch over'Eveleen lia with the same care as though she were his own   daughter, returned again to Kildare, ink and before the day of sailing had arrived he ly had stoically tpade up his mind to part from 'D her with resignation. The dreaded hour of separation at length ha! came, and Robert Wilson fairly-forcing Eve- th leen from the close embrace of Mrs. Jack- of on, bore her to his carriage, which was in an( waiting, and at about sundown they started. din   nt- on the road to Dublin. As they went lei- lot surely along, the farmer spent his time in en consoling his niece, and advising her as to in her future course, but to all his remarks Eve- e- leen could only answer by-stifled sobs, The as shades of night gathered around, as they ap. ad preached the capital,fromrn wich they were or not distant more than a mile, when suddenly ie, the driver tumbled headlong to the ground ke from a blow from a stone, and the next mo- ment both the doors of the carriage were d, pulled open, and Eveleen dragged forth from er one side and gagged, while the fanner was - st seized upon from the other side, and in spite or of his resistance, gagged, bound .and tied ie fast to one of the wheels of the carriage, while Eveleen was born swiftly away by a be party of ruffians before his eyes. So sud- er denly was it all performed, that it seemedvto )e the farmer more like a' dream than a reality. t. A half hour of almost insupportable an. d guish to the farmer passed by, yet nobody g came to his assistancee and he was on the r point of fainting, when suddenly he perceived I symptoms of returning animation in the dri- k ver, who shortly afterwards, with a heavy e groan, raised his head and looked around r- him. Slowly he revived, returning con- it sciousness bringing with it the recollection d of what had passed, and, though very weak e from the loss of blood, he arose to his feel a and soon succeeded in liberating Mr. Wilson o The farmer's first act was to bind his hand. "kerchief around the injured man's head and na place him in the cakriage-tnen, mounting e the box, and taking the reins himself, he r drove rapidly till he had reached' the first house, to the gentleman occupying which he told what had happened, saw his servant put  safely in bed, and his wounds attended to, and then started speedily forward to Dublin, iand notified the police of the diabolical trans- - action. All that night, and all the next day, , the most expert members of the detective I force were on the alert, scouting every part , of Dublin, but not a clue that could lead to the recovery of the girl, or the perpetrators of the outrage, could be found; and Captain O'Reilly, who had waited till the very last moment in hopes that the agonized uncle would receive some tidings of his lost niece, was reluctantly obliged to sail without her, and Mr. Wilson, with a  heavy heart, after offering a large reward for the discovery of the fiends, returned to his now lonely dwel. ling. The day-after the Dart had sailed, a meet. ing took place between Dr. Stvkes and Nel- ly Blossom, in the house of the latter on the Dublin quays, "Well," -exclaimed Stykes, rubbing hi hands together in a satisfied manner} as though he had got through the performanoe of a  disagreeable task, -'" she is off at lat, and that job is finished." He was a thbi diminutive, dried-er, withered old wretoi  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7813-00000042"/> with small, piercing grey eyes, sallow com- au plexion, and a v oice which sounded like -the pi grating of a rusty hinge. "She is off at re last, and I wish her a prosperous voyage, sC with all my heart-I hope she'll arrive at w New York in good order and well con- he ditioned-he, he, he!" and a sardonic grin re overspread the horrid features of the dia- bj bolical old beast..          hi "There ain't much doubt but that she'll si arrive there safe enough," answered Nelly, w "for Sharkey is well known as a verysafe t captain, and has never yet fell through with s] an undertaking. You have written to notify d Bernard that -she is on her way, hav'nt M you E" "O, yes," answered Stykes," I have writ- ten two letters, for fear the first might mis- -eatry. , There is nothing like doing business in a safe way--it would be too bad to have our trouble for our pains, after going as far as We have gones"          - "' It's most tirn we have received-a, re- r mittance from him, I think," said Nelly. r "O, that'll come--that'll come!" answered E -Stykes, in a confident tone, " never fear- 1 he wouldn't dare trifle with us!" . "I don't think he would," remarked t Nelly, "for it isn't too late to injure his ( cause yet-it is this, in fact, that makes me I 4Wink stranger of his not having sent us any 1 minhey." "Perhaps it may have miscarried," sug- gested old Stykes, while an uneasy look I settled upon his disgusting visage. "Perhaps so," said Nelly, "but I sup. pose we shall know in time." "I s'posO so," answered Stykes, seem- ingly much relieved by the easy manner in which his companion took the matter--"I s'pose so-but I've got two or three patients to call upon, and must be going." "You have considerable practice just now, havn't you?" inquired Nelly, as Stykes's hand sought the door-knob. "O, yes, i can't complain," he answered, "I have a great number of patients, now, and many of them are of the right stamp." "What do you   mean by the right stamp?" inquired Nelly, with some curiosity. "I Why," said the fiendish wretch, leering horribly, "I mean those whose deaths would benefit me more than their recovery. Some folks, you know, are fortunate enough to be rich-but they can't keep off sickness, and when they are taken ill, they are un, fortunate enough to have heirs who at such a time are wide awake. Now, if one of these sad heirs should put a thousand pounds in my way as an evidence of his just ap- preciation of my medical skill, "I should be very foolish if I didn't take it, wouldn't I 1 and if, in spite of my skill, the patient should die, I couldn't help it, could'I I Of course not, most indubitably not. Now, I have at -thi.me two patients under iny treatment   and although they are not seriously iM t present, something' tells me they will never recover; and I scarcely ever have a pre- sentiment of that kind come over me, but what it turns out true-singular, isn't itl he! he! he! Good-bye, Nelly, I hope our remittance will come along soon--good* bye!" and as he qpened the door and took his way through the entry that' led to the street, he muttered to himself--1"Don't you wish you may get a remittance . You little think I've got it here!" he continued, as he slapped his hand upon his pocket---" youl'v done most of the work, while I've run awa with the spoils-he! he I! he!!!" CHAPTER XX ABOUT two weeks after the transatlonr - related in the last chapter took- place, and nearly two years after the landing of Ber- l nard and his vile friends in New York, the - latter with Pat Flanders and Tim Doyle, were seated in one of the rooms of the brick I building on the Third Avenue, which Dol- 'cey Jones had procured for them. Their B long course of dissipation and crime, began y to tell fearfully upon their constitutions: Bernard had lost the fresh, vigorous look - which he once possessed-his face was k bloated, his eyes dull and- haggard, and his nervous system greatly prostrated. Pat ,. seemed to have suffered not quite so much,} though he, too, looked anything, but health- I- ful; while the boy Tim, had in one short n year grown prematurely old, a:nd although I but about seventeen years of age, would ts have passed for twenty, easily. Bill Stark had left them some days before. Bernard v, had informed him that Eveleen was on her. 's way to New York, and he at once came to the conclusion that he would rather follow d, his own fortunes than to continue his parti- v, nership with Bernard any longer. The !" money which Bernard had brought with him ht had been long before exhausted, and for the y. past twelve months they- had lived entirely ag upon the proceeds of different burglaries hs which they had committed in Williams- y. burgh, Brooklyn, and Jersey City. The ;h restriction which they had at first imposed B8, upon the boy Tim, had been removed, and wn4 he was not only allowed to pick pockets but' eh encouraged to do it; and so expert was he, of that he had never once beePn caught. Bill dAs tark, as we- have said, determired to cut Lp- loose from the party as soon as he heard be that Eveleen was on her way to New York, I so he called for a division of the proceeds of lid their last burglary, and bidding them all :se good-bye, took his leave, without stating at which way it was his intention to travel, but xnst prorising at the same time that whateve   ght .happen to, hjm self, he would never, blow' ;them. :(' So:!.Bil-has left us," said Bernard, with a sigh, addressing Pat. b Thrue for yo," answered  that indivi- dual, "  an' it's mesilf that's sorry for that same, for the divil a betther man iver hand- led a jimmy."  "He was a good man," answered Ber- nard, " but we must manage to get along 1 without him. I wonder how ](ng before I this vessel, the Flirt, will be ;n i"  t 'Iv she's been out fourteen days, we r Ought to expict her in about tip. days more, I should think," answered Pat.     I "I should think myself that she'd be here u in about that time," answered Bernard; e "and now all that I'm puzzled about is, who a I shall get to wait upon her when she does d come. WBe shall have to be very careful for a:while and lead her to suppose after she I arrives ilere, that she has fallen among " friends. I received a letter to-day from v Stykes, who informfs me that but for his in- j terference, O'Reilly would have brought/her o over under his protection, in which case I fear I should have experienced some 'diffi- P culty in getting hold of her, for he is a sharp ,old c istonier, and a great friend of my fa. w ther s. Let me see," he continued, thought- cE iway, " who can I get to attend to her after In ,Sharkey gets her here?"       Cc "' Why, wouldn't Dick Slocum do?" sug- sl gested Pat.               bi "I've been thinking of him," said Ber- ul nard, "he  would be just the man, if we O could get him to undertake it. I did think da at first I would have her takenl to Dolce re Jones's, but I have nmade up my mind to sh have her brought here.  If I can get Dick, of and Amy Gray to take up their residence th here for a  time, and act as th1- friends of D Haviland, I don't think we shall have much tu trouble.

As Pat had predicted, the night-set in wet and gloomy, and at eight o'clock he en- cased himself in a light india-rubber over. coat, in an inside pocket of which he con- cealed a bunch of skeleton kcvs, a jimmy, a slung shot, and a small coil' of rope, and bidding Tim prepare himself, they we-e soon upon their way to that delectable locality is Orange-street, known  as Pete Williams' dafiee-house.

I myself have made such inquiries in the neighborhood, as leads me to suppose that he has money constantly by him, and it is our intention to borrow some of it forthwith." "Good enough!" cried Minxy, rubbing his hands gleefully, "I'm fairly rustin' for the want ot' exercise, and.

It was twelve o'clock whenAthe reached the opposite side of the river,'and the night was still dark and wet-a fine mist was falling and the sound of the wind, as it swept in fitful gusts around the different corners and through the branches of the shade trees that flanked the street through which they were waliing, on either side, came upon the ears of the guilty party like the voices of spirits pleading with them to forego their wicked design. They kept steadily upon their way for a distance of about a mile and a half, when Bernard ordered a halt a short distance from a plain, modest-looking row of buildings, and whispered to Minxy, "That's the row, and our friend lives in the third house. Now, Timmy," he continued, bending his head down and placing his mouth close to the boy's ear, " go up cautiously, and see if there are any lights burning. Listen, also, and find out if there is any one stirring about the house."  The boy started off, and after he was gone, Bernard continued, "I don't think there is much doubt but what they're all asleep sopnd enough for these broad-brims have a way of q. retiring early." He was not wrong in his conjecture, fore in about fifteen minutes Tim returned and reported that every thing was as it should be. Having ascertained this fact, Bernard head. i! ed the party, and leading the way, they ap- I proched the house noiselessly.

' ly - While this conversation was being held w by the burglars outside the house, the inmates, all but one, unsuspicious of danger, Ig were sleeping tranquilly in their beds.

She had extinguished her light and laid herself alongside of her child in bed about five minutes previous to Tim's approaching the house, but She was ill at ease and did'not feel inclined to sleep. After sighing heavily a number of times, and turning uneasily in her bed, she at length drew her baby close to her breast, and had managed to sink into an uneasy8lumber, when the door of her apartment was. cautiously opened, and Ber- nard Wilson, carrying in his hand a small bull's-eye lantern, entered. Noiselessly ap- proaching the sleeper, he allowed the rays of the lamp to shine upon her face, her eyes opened at'the same instant, and Bernard started back as though he had seen an ap- parition. He would have fled from  the room, but the female, who had caught a glimpse of his countenance, bounded out of the bed, and, the next moment Bernard W-il- son and Norah Burns. stood face to face. The pale, meek, almost angelic countenance of the girl contrasted fearfully with the hag- gard, brutal features of the villain, who with a half-muttered curse scowled fearfully upon her. They regarded each other for a mo- ment in silence, when at length Bernard, in a suppressed voice, hissed forth between his set 4eeth, "You here! you are eternally crossing my path and thwarting my purpose!  Must I  always be troubled by you "  !" A   sigh which seemed to rend the very . heart of Norah burst from  her lips, and I placing her delicate white hand upon the X shoulder of Bernard, she looked steadily into t his face, and said,           I "  It was God who sent you here, Bernard. t I   expected you.

I will p- pass over the happy, joyous days of our'first ie intimacy, when enraptured I hung upon the a music of your words, and was willing to be. f lieve you almost more than mortal, and come I- to the time when you made known to me the a. horrible truth that the law had not legalized e our marriage, and cruelly, heartlessly de- r. serted me Ifor another.

Such, however, as I have said, t was not the opinion otmankind, and I found myself, when I refused to accept pecuniary F aid from you, a homeless, penniless girl, I bereft alike of character and friends. When 'my situation with all its horrors at first burst upon me, I  contemplated suicide ; and had I been alone in the world, it is moro than probable I should have laid violent thands upon myself, but I did not dare to kill Imy infant. I  was too proud to seek a re- tuge in my guardian's house after having left it against his consent, and at length, driven to desperation, I  became perfectly reckless, and in one evil hour became the travelling companion of a mati who soon after brought me to New York, and placed mean the house in which  you first saw me in America. Our meeting on that night was my salvation, for it recalled to my recollection what I  had once been, and with that recollection came the thought that I might, if 1   bent all my energies to that end, return to the paths of virtue, and fit myself to educate my child and train her up religiously. Thatl night I  learned to pray. I poured forth my whole soul in sup, pication to God to aid'me in my good re. solve, and the next morning I  sought the, residence of a lady whose name I had- often seen mentioned in the papers as a pliilanthropist, and a- friend to wretched beings like myself. To her, without re serve, I related nmy story, and she at ow*o determined to assist me. With a  mother's iF  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7813-00000044"/> kindness she whispered words of encourage- ment and consolation in my ear, and after havinrig remained with her for nearly a year, she placed me in this house, where I have been ever since, loved by and loving the kind people who have generously offered me an asylum among them, and now with a full sense of all my former wickedness, I feel myself regenerated, and am deter- mined to consecrate the remainder of my days to the service of that great and good Being who has rescued me as a brand from the burning. O, Bernard," she continued, while tears of supplication chased each other down her pallid cheek," Lcannot but think that you did once feel some slight de- gree of love for me, and by that love I con- Eure you to forsake the dangerous courseof ife which you are pursuing--for the sake of the dear babe who lies slumbering there in angel innocence, drop your evil associa- tions, and do not allow the cold world to say when she shall have reached the age of womanhood, that her father ended his career upon the gallows!" Bernard Wilson, during the poor girl's ex- hortation, was filled with sensations such as he had never experienced before. For the first time in his life he allowed himself to think how happy he might have been with such a wife, had he pursued the proper course, but instantly the recollection of the horrible crimes of which he had been guilty, came vividly to his mind, presenting, as it were, an impassable barrier between him- self and reformation, and when Norah, who perceived that she had touehed his heart of stone, flung herself at his feet, and begged him for the love of God to kneel with her and pray, he choked down his emotion, and exclaimed- "It is altogether too late for me to think of doing good, even if I were so disposed, which I am not-where are the valuables ." ", O no, no, no!" exclaimed Norah pas- sionately, " it is never too late to do good --pray, pray, Bernard! Fly to the mercy seat of C;xist, and though thy sins were as searlet t}ly nhhal be white as snow . " "O, to tro devil wifh this nonsense!" ex- claimed the ruflian, who had by this time eaiken off every symptom of remorse, " will   you show me where {he valuables are keip or must I search for them myself?" "( The last hope to which I clung has vanished!" said Norah as she arose from her kneeling position; " but now I have a duty to perform---Bernard," she continued, fixing her large tearful eyes full upon his face a' you must touch nothing in this house." "What!" he answered, as his hand sought a dagger which was concealed in his bosom, "would you dare to give the alarm n" "You are my husband in the sight of God, and the father of my child," she replied, "' and as much as I hate your evil practices, I should not like to know that you were im- mured within thewalls of a prison, but you must not touch anything in this house. If you attempt it, though my life should pay the forfeit, I will give the alarm." At this moment the door opened slowly, and Minxy Muff poked his head in.: "Hello, Jenks," he whispered, as he turned his glance first upon Norah and then upon Bernard; "business before pleasure, you know--if you've got any private mat-- ter to settle with that ere gal you'd better meet her somewhere after the swag is safe. Tim has found out where the pewter is, and is just about helpin' himself to it, so you'd better go below and leave me to:;keep the gal quiet."' Bernard cast a look full of meaning upon Norah, and turned to leave the apartment, but she stopped him with the remark- "Remember what I have said-I wiil do it!" The villain saw, from the expression of the girl's countenance, that she intended t0 keep her word, and suddenly thrusting hia hand in his coat pocket, he drew forth a handkerchief, and rushing towards her he exclaimed,- "Nay, then, I have a plan to make yo sure!"     -  She saw that it was his intention to bine it around her mouth, but before he could ac- complish his purpose, with the speed of lightning she dashed by him and Mipxy gained the stairs, and as she bounded along towards the room in which the old Quakel and lhis wife slept, she shrieked, "Murder! thieves!" to the fullest extent of her lang   CHAPTER XXI f     ' THR piercing shrieks of qorah aroused th( inmates of the house, and almost immedi atelv a couple of male domestics, together with the proprietor himself-an old gentle- man named Wood--came rushing upon he scene, just in time to save Norah's life, by putting the villains to flight.

As he finished speaking she revived, and gazing hurriedly into the faces of the fright- iened group thatsurrounded her, she inquired -timidly - ] "' Have they gone?

For some mo- de inents it seemed to her that she had just pr awoke from a frightful dream, but as she to gazed around the apartment in which she  was confined, her recollection came back to ret her, and the direst apprehensions filled her res mind as a thousand terrifying surmises qu crowded upon her with regard to the inten- mr tions of her captors. She felt certain that ha her cousin Bernard, whom she still supposed kec to be in Ireland, was the prime mover in tre z the transaction, but what his intentions were enti she could not surmise.  "Perhaps he    " means," she said to herself, "to get me out inqi to sea, and then sink me, with weights to  " my feet, in the deep water, so that all traces Sha of me may be lost, and I may never be tinu heard of again--or perhaps he has given all E this lawless crew permission to do as they  " please with me, and a fate worse than death inqu awaits me!"

I know i there is law enough there to punish me, if the act was known. But"-and here he fixed a look upon her which made her tremble. "I want to tell you exadty how you are situated with us.

Keep mum while you are on board, and after we landy ou in New-York, till the brig has sailed agn, and then you may raise as great a hullabaloo as you please-but if you act otherwise you know the consequences-so now you can make up your mind." This was a stroke of good fortune thr which Eveleen haa not looked, and she promised to obey the ruffian's commands implicitly so long as he observed a respect- ful bearing towards her. Indeed she would not, even could she have done so without risking her own safety, have claimed the protection of any other vessel, so long as Sharkey' and his crew treated her properly, for, poor girl! she imagined that the brig she was in, although manned by ruffians, was bearing her to a haven of bliss; and she looked upon the crew as instruments in- the hand of Heaven, to bring about her union with her lover. CHAPTER XX" ONE morning, about a fortnight after the burglarious. demonstration in Jersey City had taken place, Bernard Wilson was seated in company with two friends---a male and female.-in the drawing-room of his resi-   dence, on the Third Avenue. His male companion was Dick Slocumb, to whom he made allusion while talking to Pat Flanders regarding Eveleen's arrival in New York, while the female was Amy Gray, Dick's reputed wife. Slocumb was a man about forty years of age, though by dint of dye- ing his whiskers and wearing false hair and teeth, he managed to make himself look con- siderably younger. He had naturally a very strong constitution, which enabled him to go through all the different grades of dissipa- tion and crime, and still retain a somewhat healthful appearance. His general habit was to dress something:in the gay and flashy order, but on the present occasion, he was clothed in a sober suit of black--had allowed his whiskers and moustache to be shaved off--for a gay, spotted cravat, he had sub. stituted a white neckerchief, and he looked more like a smooth-faced Methodist parson than what he really was. Moreover, his knowledge of the world, and his constant habit of practising dissimulation had enabled him to assume almost any character he chose, and no one would have recognized in the demure-looking indvidual, the reckless, unprincipled frequenter of Dolcy Jones's. His vile female companion, Amy Gray, was a woman about thirty years of age, possess- ing a countenance of that non-committal cast, if we may be allowed the term,- which would lead a careless observer to think that she might be an exemplary character or she might not--there was a lack of speculation in her dull, heavy, mud-colored eye, a stif- fened rigidity in her features generally, and her whole face seemed to be totally expres- sionless. She also was dressed in a very becoming, modest manner; and anybody who did not know them would have taken Dick Slocumb and Amy Gray for a staid, sober couple--a brace of God-fearing citi- zens. "So, she has arrived, has she " said Dick, addressing Bernard. "She has," answered that individual, "she arrived last night,; 'a.-! --.ything is -as I could wish it-but, x-A.-e lq :,o time to be lost-you must wsi; up-.ion hctr at once. 'for I shan't feel safe till ' hhVC possession , of her." I3 It strikes me," said Dick, " that you've \ taken a good deal of unnecessary trouble in this matter. If you wanted to get rid of the girl, why didn't you let the captain of the brig that brought her over drop her over board at sea .' "It was my intention to hove done so at 5rst," answered Bernard, "but upon reflec- tion I altered my mind. I came to the conclu- sion that Bill Haviland would a good deal sooner hear of her death, than to learn that she was my mistress, which I am now de- d termined that she shall be."  "Well, if that's your object," answered   loenmb, "I call understand it, and I think you act perfectly reasonable--that's the way I should have done.  Now, how do you propose that I should approach her ", Why,' returned Bernard, " that I must leave, in a great measure, to your own judg- ment. I have stowed Pat and Tim Doyle away in a crib in Duane-street, whither I shall proceed myself, and leave you and Amy sole possessors of the house for the time being. You had better manage to see fSharkey first. I will give you a letter of, introduction to him and then you will have no farther trouble. Approach her as the friend of Haviland, who you can state is oat of town, or anything you please. You can surely devise some story to blind a green girl, or I am mistaken in you." Bernard then wrote a few lines to Sharkey, stating Slocumb's business, and handing it to Dick, e said, " now I am going to take a trip to c Hoboken-I'll hire a carriage on my way to the ferry, selecting a driver that I can trust, t and you and Amy must throl  you selves into it as soon as it arrives, and be off at 1 once. I've told you enough about the char- I acter of Bill Haviland and all the residets f in the neighborhood of my fattier's bouse at home, to enable you to throve her comnplete.-  ly off her guard, for she does not suspect s that I am here, and will feel certain that you h derived your information from  Ifaviland himself. Now, then, success to you." And li Bernard put on his hat and sallied foirth. !sE Me had not been gone more/than fifteen tl or twenty minutes, when a carriage drove si up to the door, Dick and Amy Gray jumped ar in, and the driver started his horses in the st direction  of the East River. Having 1 reached Peck Slip, the/carriage stopped in the square in front of the ferry Iouse, and n Dick and Amy getting out, took their way h( to one of the wharves lying on-the right of h( the ferry.  They had no difficulty in finding He the vessel of which they were in search, ca and going on board, Dick illquired for the ri captain, and Sharkey stepping up,'Dick, at' Ii: ter satisfying' himself there could be no H doubt about his identity, handed him Ber- stc nard's letter. "All right," said he, when he had pe- ju rused it-" the gal's below---now wait till I so, go and frighten her a little, so that she can't de have any suspicion that I  know you. and of then I'll introduce you to her."    to At the time Dick and Amy went on board, W Eveleen was in the cabin, pondering over wa her untoward fate, and trying to lay out in ha her mind some course of'action. Poor girl! out her situation would have been a terrible one, and even had her lover been in the cityi if he fea was unaware of ler arrival. But what was Di( the real fact of the case? She was alone of in a strange city---thousands of miles from and home--surrounded by enemies---young, in-  experieneed and timid, and without a single fing   ink human being to counsel or. protect her. "O, vay if William only knew that I was here," she (ou exclaimed, " how he would fly to welcome me! But he does not, and such being the ust case, what steps can I take? which way Ig- shall I turn? I -am an entire stranger here, yle and if I walk forth into the city alone, I may rI become the victim of evil-disposed persons. nd Father of the friendless!" she continued, he casting her eyes imploringly towards Hear. ee en, " direct me how to proceed!" of, "Wide awake, my lass!" exclaimed Shar. ve key, who at this moment stuck his head in he at the cabin door, 'there's a lady and gentle- is man inquiring for Miss Eveleen Wilson-.. ou they say they are friends of an acquaintance en of yours named Haviland!"  rd  " O, thlank God!" exclaimed Eveleen fer- / ig vently. k, "But mind ye," continued Sharkey, " none to o' yer blabbin' till I have a chance to cut to and run,- d'ye hear?---remember what I t, told yer, or it'll be worse for yer!" s  "1 shall remember," replied Eveleen, it hardly knowing what she said, as she hasti- r- ly threw on her -hat and shawl,'and almost s flew on deck. It "Is this Miss Wilson?" inquired Dick !- ocum., in as affable a tone as he could as- t slime, at the same timie taking her delicate ua hand in his own and shaking it gently. d "Yes, sir," she replied, " what of Wil- dliam.,  Why did he not come  to me- him- self "   Then as the thought occurred to her 1 that he might perhaps be dangerously ill, a a sickening, dizzy sensation came over-her, Iand leaning upon a   bale of goods which ; stood upon tie deck for support, she iiluired, is he ill 1  "   .... I    " O, no," answered Dick, in a lively man ner, "  our friend Haviland was quite well, in body, the last time we heard from him, but he was suffering terribly in mind. You see, lie expected you here in the Dart, under the care of Captain O'Reilly, but that vessel ar- rived two days ago, and the captain informed him that you had been kidnapped. Since Havilands arrival in New York he has been stopping at our house, but when he had re- ceived the unwelcome intelligence I  have just mentioned, he started at once to settle some business concerning a-country resi- dence which he had purchased on the banks of the Hudson, begging us in the meantime, to watch for any tidings concerning you. We have accordingly kept some one on the watch for every vessel from Ireland, and have at last had the good fortune to find vou out." Then lowering his voice somewhat, and looking cautiously around, as though fearful he might be overheard by somebody, Dick continued, "I don't half like the looks of this Captain-was you forced' on board and detained against your will a" "Hush!" replied Eveleen, laying het finger upon her lips---" time will explain all  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7813-00000046"/> -at present I must be silent--when William comes, I shall not be afraid to speak." "Come, then," said Amy Gray, speaking for the first time, and trying to smile benig- nantly upon Eveleen, "let us proceed home- ward, and when we have arrived there, you can write to Mr. Haviland at once. Richard, my love," she continued, turning to Dick, "be kind enough to call the carriage, won't you?--I'm sure Miss Wilson must be very anxious to escape from this disagreeable vessel-are you not, dear . ,  , "O, yes," answered Eveleen eagerly," I sal11 not feel safe till I am away from here." "Then we will start at once," said Amy, as the carriage rolled up at the side of the pier---" have you much baggage ." "No, I have but very little," answered Eveleen, "William wrote me that it would be unnecessary for me to bring more than I stood actually in need of, so I only packed up one trunk." "In that case," said Amy, "we can take it with us," and having seen the trunk al- luded to brought up and fastened on behind, the two jumped into the carriage, and were soon on their way towards the Third Avenue. "CHere we are," exclaimed Dick, as the carriage drew up in front of Bernard Wil- son's house, and giving his hand to Eveleen, he conducted her in, saying, Consider this house your own,-and act precisely as if you were at home, till Mr. Haviland arrives." F JFor the first time since her abduction, Eveleen, as she took a seat in the drawing room,l and divested herself of herahat and shawl, felt happy. Entirely unsuspicious and completely deceived, she answered the questions that were put to her concerning- her uncle, Mrs. Jackson, Biddy Ryan, and others, with as much readiness as though they had been propounded by Haviland him- self Poor girl! she stood upon the edge of an abyss--completely in the power of the fiends who surrounded her, yet ignorant  of the fact, and happy in her ignorance.  "If you please," she said, addressing Amy Gray, when she had rested herself ' somewhat, and collected her thoughts, "I will spend the remainder of this day in writ-  ing to my friends."  "Certainly," answered the debased wo- i man with alacrity, as she arose and conduct-  ed Eveleen to a very neatly furnished apart- minnt on the second floor; " this is the room  we have set apart for you," she continued ; "here you can be as private as you like.  You can be closeted here day in and day  out if you please, without being interrupted I by any one." "O," answered Eveleen, laughingly,t "I do not wish to make a recluse of myself--- my disposition is social, and I have no doubt 1 you will tire of my company before I shall  of yours." A\             i "I ar inclined to think nod*," answered    Amy, as a smile of horrid meaning palae over her face, "I gue/ss you will grow tired of us first. However, time will tell. Good morning!" and leaving Eveleen, she joined Dick Slocumb in the room below. The first letter that Eveleen commenced was of course to Haviland, and it contained a full statement of all that she had. felt, and thought, and suffered for the past twelve months; she Went'over all the particulars of the parting between herself and friends; her brutal abduction while on the road to Dublin; her forcible conveyance and detainment on board the brig; her passage to America; ald her final nleeting with Dick Slocumb and Amy Gray. She then indicted a long epis- tle to her uncle, and another to Mrs. Jack- son, and then fairly tired out, as the bright sun sank to rest behind Hohoken hills, she threw herself upon a bed in the room, and was soon buried in tranquil slumber. CHAPTER XXII1. BERNARD WILSON'S first care, after having got Eveleen fairly in his power, was to cir- culate a report in the neighborhood that his sister, who was subject to fits of temporary insanity, had arrived at New York from Dublin, and that unwilling to send her to any asylum. he had taken herto his own residence, in order that she might not suffer for want of attention. This statement he thought it expedient to make in case that at any time Eveleen might from the window of her apart- ment, which was a rear room, make an appeal to the neighbors, after she had be- come possessed of a full knowledge of her' situation. Three days passed away after Eveleen had dispatched her letters, the mailing of which, she entrusted to Dick Slocumb, when she received an answer to the one which she had written to Haviland, stating that he would be with her on the day following. "Do not, dear Eveleen," was the winding up of it, "receive me in the presence of your friends; such a meeting as ours will be, should not be witnessed by those who could not .understand the extravagance of our joy. Let me find you alone in your own room, where I may unheard and unobserved, pour into your willing ear all the sensations that will fill my swelling heart. I expect 1 shall arrive in New York about eight o'clock in the evening, and shortly after that hour you may look for me. Till then, dearest, restrain ' your impatience to see me, and believe me, 8 the same affectionate William.'" Oh, what a thrill of joy ran through the frame of Eveleen as she read the welcome news. Already she imagined herself in tie arms of her lover, and felt his lips glued to her own. But a day, one little day, although   t eemed to her an age, remained between her aud happiness; then she would be amply 'repaid- for all the weary hours, the bitter tears, the agonizing reflections which she had endured-then she could look into his face, and tell hitm how she. had suffered for him, and how willing she was to suffer, since it was for him-then she would in one mo- ment experience a degree of ecstasy that would comlpensate for an age of woe. With joy beaming in her sweet face, she rushed to communicate the happy tidings to the vile couple under whose protectionshe had placed herself, and then; after recei:ing their hvphcritical congratulations, she rel turned to herroom to weep-for jov, and to await there the happy hour she looked for but, oh, how wearily, with what a snail's  pace did the hours drag along!  T'o her  * they seemed as lengthy as they would seem  short to the condemned wretch whose lease  of life has nearly expired.- She could not  sit, nor' stand, nor lie down, nor walk the r floor. If she attempted to read, she could ' see but one word on the page, and hat word c was William; if]e. threw herself upon her n couch and bur  i her face in the pillow in i the endeavor toleep, a 'group of tfantastic  faces would greet her imagination, which tv would eventually resolve themselves into n ,one face, and that face was Haviland's; and i o  passed that long, long night. The a wrecked mariner never greeted the first view of a bail with half the delight that she g beheld the dawn of the morning that-she tI fondly trusted would end her sorrows upon t earth S  pringing from hler bed as the first ti ray of light penetrated the apartment, she go dashed some cold water upon her temples, he attended to her toilet, and busied herself in idr readig over and over again the different etters that she had received from timnle to I  time from Haviland. At this occupation in she remained till summoned to breakfast, pe She obeyed the call and seated herself at the table, but she could not eat; her brow ho: was hot and feverish, her brain in a whirl, and her heart beat wildly. She could nei- Th ther eat nor talk, and soon again returned to tin her apartment, again to pore over her lover's ' epistles. In this manner the morning passed " ti away, and afternoon commenced. "Let me  not die of impatience, just Heaven!" she hi  t zclaimed, as the clock lazily struck hour bet after hour--fbur, five, six; seven o'clock was --t told by the tongue of time, and she sat like tien a statue, her face towards the ,door, waiting * ' for eight! It struck at length, and ere the aire vibrason of the last tone had died away, the pre s ttreef door was opened and she heard a w  it quick footfall on the stairs ; steadily onward qui it came till it paused before the door of her war apartment-- she trembled violently-her  M heart  was in h er Shrot-her temples throb- Eve bed wildly-the next moment the door was acro thrown open, and Bernard Wilsoh . with all ima   'een the malice which his black heart could die. ply tate, gleaming in his eyes, stood before her, litter and without uttering a single cry or groan she she dropped to the floor as though stricken , his by lightning.  -    ' I for  uncle       -   -  mo- that      CHAPTER   XXIV.

"t  "I am sorry," answered Eveleen, " that to I have given you so much trouble ; indeed, n indeed, I am very sorry, but I will recom- t. pense you for it, before we leave this place." t    "What we " inquired the hag, grinning w horribly. , "William and 1," answered Eveleen - Then suddenly recollecting herself, she con- tinun ed, "how late did you say it was?" "Teo   o'clock," was the gruff reply, " time you was asleep." a "O, I cannot go to sleep without seeing ;  him--I am  strong enough--I feel much better than I did.-- am quite recovered.

"Harry Jenks!" returned Eveleen in t sbme bewilderment, "I am acquainted with q no such person."   . "You ain't, eh " answered the woman, with a laugh; " come, come--that won't do b with me-I'm too old a bird to be caught i with sich chaff as that-I've come across E these innocent gals before. All I've got to - say is, if you don't know him, he knows a you well enough, or he wouldn't have gone n to the trouble of having you brought from 1 Ireland here."            c "Can William have given an assumed i name?" said Eveleen, musingly, " and if he 1 has done so, what could have been his 1 object ."              J "No 'sumed name about it," answered the 1 beldam--" come, come-one lover's as good  as another--I used to be just like you  once, but I found out as I grew 6lder it w wouldn't pay---you think your AustraliaN lover is here, but he ain't---Jenks has out-i generaled him, and Jenks is your man, so ' you might as well make up your mind to it ; first as last." "Then it was reality!" ejaculated Eve- leen in utter despair, " and I am lost!" "Lost!" cried her hideous companion, holding up her hands in wonderment; " well, you are the strangest gal I know of---lost! why, you're only just found! Why can't you make up your mind?--you'll like it just as well after a while---Jenks is good look- ing, and he's got plenty money---I don't see what-more you want! Besides, he must love you, else he wouldn't a took so much trouble to get hold of you, when he could have got plenty that would have been glad of the chance so much nearer home." "O, merciful God!" groaned Eveleen,.in agony, "why does my guardian angel slumber?" "No use talkin' 'bout guardian angels!" exclaimed the heartless old woman---" yel- low boys or bank notes is the only guardian angels I knows of, and if you ain't got them, the rest ain't o' much use." "This womran must have some touch of compassion in her heart," thought Eveleen, as the idea occurred to her that she might, by working upon the housekeeper's feelings induce the old woman to assist her in escap- ingq; so fixing her eyes upon the old har- ridan, she timidly inquired her name. "Mag. Forrester is the name I go by," /Gvas the answer she received, "although I've had fifty in my life-time, but that's as good as any." I Have you got any children?" inquired Eveleen. '9No," answered the old woman, with horrible coolness. "I pever wanted to be troubled with brats. I've been tried twice for infanticide, so you may draw your own   conclusions-I was nevtr convicted, though -no, no-I never was- convicted-oh, I'll teach you a thing or two before our ac- quaintance ends, l- warrant -you!" and as she said this she took a pinch of Snuff. Eveleen was terribly shocked at the cool brutality of the fiend before her, but conquer- ing her feelings as well as she was able, she said: "Mrs. Forrester, listen to me. You are a woman, and one whose lease of life has now nearly expired.. You were once young like myself, and may at some time in the course of your career, have been alone and friendless. If such is the case, you will know how to pity me. I am an orphan, thousands of miles removed from home and friends---persecuted, deceived, and most heartlessly betrayed--yet I am not the guilty creature you seem to think me. I call Heaven to witness that I am guiltless of vice in any form; I have ever been, and let what will-happen, shall ever remain free "from the stain of pollution. Oh, then, if you have the slightest feeling of humanity, t aid me to escape from the custody of the bad man into whose power I have fallen, and that one act, in the day of final account, when we shall meet together at the dread , tribunal, to answer our misdeeds here, will , shine so luminously in the recording angel's ! book, as to cancel by its effulgence a whole t page of crime. Assist me for the love of t God!" she continued, vehemently, as with an effort, she raised herself in bed, and im- i ploringly grasped the passive arm of the t old woman, " surely, surely, you cannot be i entirely deaf to the call of mercy! You see I before you, a poor, weakly, sick, and friend- I less girl, one whose heart is breaking with the agony that fills it, and whom despair has i rendered well nigh frantic---assist her---and I not only will you receive the blessing of Heaven, but my uncle, when he hears of it, ' will load you with gold!" "Thlere was a time," answered the old n woman, as she released her arm from the , grasp of Eveleen, "when you might have been able to throw the dust in my eyes by F such talk, but you can't do it now, for I'm , too old, I know too much. As for your un- t, cle---unless. you mean one of them in s Chatham-street, with a sign of three balls - in front of the door, hasn't Harry Jenks told - me that he wouldn't give you a cent to save your life? And didn't he tell me likewise, "that you'd playt virtuous, and attempt to h bribe me?

When Harry comes to -see you to. h morrow--he won't trouble you agin, to- e night, so you needn't be afraid about that--, e you had better receive him like a reasonarn n ble gal, and you'll find him the lovingest fel,   lom, imaginable; but, he can be savage, J - know, -when he s opposed.

She made  no answer, but waited till her horrid eom- panion had departed and locked the door t after her, when she rose from, her bed and p attempted to walk acrosj the floor. She t found that she was extremely weak, how- h ever, and after-resting for a moment, in an p easy chair, she felt a drowsiness steal over t, her, and muttering a short prayer, she threw i herself upon the bed and was soon sound asleep. NWrhen her deep breathing evidenced a, a state of unmistakable somnolency, a suf  i' fling noise took place beneath the bed, and i the next moment the boy Tim stuck his head out.                 ea "Whew!" said he, in a suppressed tone , as he  gained the middle of the floor, and I stood uprights ,' may the divil fly away wid aft me, iv the ould woman i$ n't afther lockin' sin me in wid the colleent I niver thought o' F. that; it was my  intenji n to sthale her rin po and jewelry an'    t....

"That's all I ask," said Eveleen; " if I can but get away from here I have no doubt that I shall find some one who will protect me till I can write to my uncle.

'Bernard Wilson!" cried Eveleen, her fine eyes flashing fire, and her cheeks burn- ing with indignation as she spoke, "thou paltry, mean, dastardly, contemptible wretch, how dare you look into my face, much less !pollute me with your degrading touch-, Hence! begone!, thou viler, monster than words can speak, and hide thy head for very shame. Are you not acting a noble, manly part, to insult a defenceless, friendless girls whose only strength lies in the sweet con- sciousness of unsullied virtue, -and whose ;only fortune is her good, name? Hence, detestable viper, ere the vengeance of a just D God overtake you!" K"Good!" answered Bernard, as he mock.  ingly applauded her; "I didn't think you was capable of delivering so womanly an address; you look as pretty again in your anger, as you did before ybu gave vent to it. t I see something now to admire in you every moment, and I'm fairly burning with love for t you. I must possess you, and so to com- lmence, suppose I take a kiss." t By this time Tim had crawled to the foot. of the bed, and was but about a yard re- r moved from the door, towards which Ber- ! nard's back was turned. All that he wished ! for, was some niomentary noise, which * might enable him to open and shut the door without detect- an, and this soon offered; for as Bernard bent his head to reach Eveleen's  cheek, she perceived the handle of the pistol ; to which Tim had made allusion, and suds  denly seizing it, she pulled it forth, and ex- ploded one of the barrels over Bernard's shoulder. Almost simultaneously with the , shot, the door opened and shut, and Tim was : clear, while Bernard, from whose cheeks e every particle of color had fled, jumped from  his victim, under the impression, for a mo [ ment, that she had wounded him, and stood ' tremblingly gazing at her. It was a scene  k for a painter, that heroic damsel, her, face , full of honest indignation'and stern resolve, -and the unprincipled, heartless villain who , stood cowed before her. e Gaining courage, at length, by hnding 8 that he was unharmed, Bernard again made , an attempt to approach her, but levelling the 1 pistol full at his breast, and placing her fin. * ger upon the trigger, she exclaimed-- r "Approach me not! I do not wish to * have your blood upon me, but if you advance r another step towards me, I will send,youa - cowaid soul unannea ed before. God-- am   r C^th0olic, and upon the Holy Cross 1 Bernard saw that she meant it, and mut- tering a smothered curse, he left the room, locking the door behind him. "Thank Heaven!" ejaculated Eveleen, after he had departed, " that I was not ob- liged to take his life; for although I feel that I should have been justified, the idea of kill- ing a human being is dreadful." She threw herself into a chair, and after some moments of deep reflection, she said, " what shall I do, which way shall I turn, after I have got clear of this house? Let me not think of it, or I shall go mad-let ,.G put my trust in X Him that tempers the wind to the shorn e lamb-surely all are not heartless, and I shall meet with some one who will pity and E trotect 'me!" " CHAPTER    XXV.      v PRECISELY as the clock struck eight, Tim- y Doyle turned the key in the lock of' Eve- w leen's room, and entered. "Now, Miss Eveleen," he said, " now is sl your time; Master Bernard, (who swears m you shall be his misthress, iv he has to starve you into it), Dick Slocumb and Amy a have gone to a  ball, and mother Forrester th is fast ashape."           ni  "I will be ready immediately," said Eve- yo leen, whose eyes were red with weeping, ch and proceeding to her trunk she took forth a  few articles of dress, and some, trinkets, shi which she done up into a small bundle, and chs then putting her purse, which contained six out sovereigns, in her pocket, she followed Tim a  v to the street door.          fho "Now," said the boy, as she was about boa dip4arting, "iv you'd take my a"vice, you tim wouldn't go down town, but cut across town, illg in the direction o' the Aist River just.

She cro/sed thetavenue when she som e -reaed Ninth-street, and turned down to- the warda- the East River.  She knew not woul   so I wliither she was going, but -she - trusted in God, and strove hard- to keep back the. tears nut- which were welling up from her heart and Dom, trying to find egress from her eyes. She walked some three squares in this een, direction, when she came to a plain, neat- ob- looking three-story brick house, with a tin that sign at the side of the door, such as Tim had kill- described, and mounting the steps, with rew many misgivings as to what would be the re- ents suit, she rang the bell. The call was soon "I answered by the landlady herself--a stout, got fhll-faced woman, about forty years of age, fit, with false curls and- teeth, and-a counte. t in nance in which suspicion of anybody and orn everything was the ruling expression, d!"What do you    want?" she  inquired mnd sharply, in a shrill, severe tone, after regard ing the poor girl attentively for a moment. "I wish to get a place to board," was the ktimid reply of Eveleen. "A    place to board!"- exclaimed the woman, in still sharper tone, " well, I never! This is a pretty time o' night for a girl of im- your age to be lookin' for a place to board! e- why didn't you wait till it was midnight .?" The poor girl trembled till she thought is she would have 'fallen to the ground, but rs mustering courage at length, she said, to  "Circumstances which it would take me y a  long time to explain, have pliced me in sr this unpleasant position, and if ybu will fur- nish me with lodgings to-night, Ian satisfy '- you as to my character.  I do eot ask for r, charity, I have some monev." h  "1 O,  dare say," answered the woman, 3, shrugging her. shoulders knowingly, " such d characters generally do, but you will find x out, my lady, that money won't always pave n way for you amongst respectable people; honest folks don't often turn their female t boarders out into the street in the night- a time, and I advise you, if you-w ant a lodg,- , ig, to go to the Station-house for one!" As s8le finished speaking, she shiut the door in Eveleen's face, and as she took her way Ito the parlor, she muttered-"These for- eigners-they're always prowlin' around the city tryin' to get into honest people's houses to see what they can steal, and they oughter bou hung, every one of'em, that's what they ought I " Eveleen wept bitterly, and seemed for a time incapable of making any farther exer- tion, but admonished at length that it was already quite late, and that every moment added to the uncertainty of her obtaining a shelter, she walked onward again. She tried at several -other places, but with no better success. Everybody suspected her, and nobody would harbor her. Some, like the landlady to whom she had first applied, advised her to go to the Stationhouse-. some suggested that if she would apply to the matron of the City Prison, that lady would take care of her. till she eoUldgain  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7813-00000049"/> admittance into the Magdalen Asylum, a where she would have a chance to reform. o0 No one for a moment doubted but she was n one of the lost sisterhood; her protestations a of innocence were all thrown away upon the a persons to whom she applied, for hadn't they e beard the same stories before . You couldn't I deceive them-no, no--they knew a trick worth two of that. Sometimes she was a jeered and laughed at by her own sex, and fi once or twice she had been accosted by men e who had offered to furnish her with lodg- t ings, on certain vile conditions.  c God help thee, Eveleen! thou weak, for- ts lorn, friendless, but pure-hearted girl! how n shall thy sensitive nature bear up against d suspicion such as this!       v She had gone the full length of the street, a and as the city clocks struck ten, she found 1 herself upon the wharf occupied by the Mior- t gan Iron Works. Dispirited, dejected, and t entirely worn out by fatigue, hunger, and a agony of mind, she seated herself upon an r old boiler, and gazed into the dark, and trea- . cherous river. The fountain of her tears was dried up, and she could not weep--her l lips were parched, her head ached dread- 1 fully, a raging fever burned upon her brow, l and as she dropped her head upon her breast,  in utter helplessness, she exclaimed aloud--  "O, William, dear William, ifyou could see me now!" Just at this moment she was startled by a male voice close by her, and looking up, she observed a man leaning against a spile. Her first impulse was to fly, but encouraged by the kindly tone in which the stranger spoke, she kept her position, and allowed him to approach her. "Why, my lass," he said, in a mild tone of expostulation,t "this is a late hour and a dangerous place for a young gal to be walk- in' about in. Why don't you go home 3" "Home!" O, how the sound of that word went to the crushed heart of the poor child, as she answered- "O. would'to God that I could!" "( Why, what hinders you?" inquired the man, "where do you live--I'll see you safe home!" "My home is in Ireland!" answered Eve- leen, with a deep-drawn sigh.  "Havn't you ot any friends here?" in quired the man.  "Not one," waf-the answer. "Well, then," aid the man, "how did you get here in thefirst place where have you been staying since you landed, and why are you wanderin' about on the docks like a ghost? No matter," he continued with great volubility, as he interrupted the answer she was about to make, " it don't make any'odds to me who you are or what you are, just now --you're a young gal, and you're houseless -that's all I want to know. I've got a ouple of gale myself, just about your age,   and who knows what might happen to one of them before they die . Come along with me-you needn't be afeard to trust me- I'm an old man--old enough to be your father- and you shall-sleep in my house to-night, even if the old woman objects, to it, which I 'spect she will."' He took Eveleen gently by the arm and assisted her to rise, but the excitement and fatigue which she had undergone had render- ed her so weak that she was scarcely able to walk, and was obliged to cling to her kind conductor for support. He led her along, talking all the way, till they arrived at a neat little yellow brick building, not a great distance from the foundry, at the door of which he paused, and Eveleen remembered as the old man inserted his night-key in the lock, that it was the last house at which she had made application for entertainment, and been refused. Before she could make any allusion to that fact, however, her conductor X had opened the door and entered, leading her  after him. "Here, Lucy," he said, addressing his * wife as he entered a room upon the first floor, "here's a young gal that I found , wanderin' around without house or home, , and I want you to give her a bed for to-night - anyhow."  , i "Well, I do say!" exclaimed the woman, regarding Eveleen with a very forbidding r look, "if that ain't the same young woman , that 1 gave a lecter to, and turned away  from the door, half an hour ago! Well, the d impudence of some folks is astonishin'!" r "Well, all I've got to say, Mrs. Baxter," d returned the old man with some severity, "if you turned her away from the door, you e ought to be ashamed of yourself, for it wasn't a a Christian act, no how!" "' John Baxter," said the old lady, with great impatience, "you're allers pickin' up d somebody in the street, and bringin' 'em I, home; and I do b'lieve if I'd let you, you'd make a hospital of the house!" At tliis point in the conversation, Eveleen e turned to leave the house, but exhausted na- fe ture could hold out no longer, and she fell fainting upon the flor. r- "Now, see that," said the kind old man, who could scarcely restrain his tears as he I- raised her gently and sat her in a chair," the poor thing is half dead.

Maybe she tells the truth and maye she dont--but what can we do  with her anyhow!" "You go to church every Sunday, don't you s, quietly said Mr. Baxter, who had by tis ime filled and lighted a pipe, and sat with his legs crossed, looking as comfirt- 'able-o possible. "Yes, I do," answered Mrs. Baxter, rf testily, "and t'rb very sorry that there's E some folks of my acquaintance that don't go al as often as 1 do!"    g "Does the parson teach you to turn ae your back upon a fellow-creature in dis- s: tress " continued the old man.

WHEN ol fMrs. Baxter arose the next er, morning, her first carewas to look after e's Eveleen, whom she foud in a raging feverr go and perfectly unconscious of every thing that was going on around her.

"  s  "I think it was veryy wrong to take her v in, I'm sure,"' said one of the girls, "'how i do we know who she is ?" 8 ": Ah, now, Ellen, that's very unkind of - you,' said the other, " wasn't it much better X to bring her in here than to allow her to re- t main ill in the street?'" l "O, yes, 'Lot," ' answered Ellen , " you're just like Pa--tere can't an old nigger come along and tell a pitiful story, but what you w  ant to take him in right away .

I'll stop on my way to the foundry and send the doctor up, and when she's well enough to talk, no doubt she'll give a good account of herself." This settled the matter. The girls were well aware that their father meant what he said, and nothing more at that time was said upon the subject. Nearly a week passed away and Eveleen did not mend in the slightest degree. The doctor had pronounced her case a very critical one, and at length old Mr. Baxter, thinking that perhaps she might have a friend in the city whom she knew nothing of, determined, to insert, a small advertisement in the Sun, to the effect that a young girl named Eveleen Wilson was in his care, desperately sick, and that any person know- ing anything concerning her would confer a favor by calling upon him. In the meantime, Bernard Wilson was nearly wild with rage when he found that ' his victim had escaped. He knew there was treachery on the part of some one of his friends, but he was far from guessing the right one. His suspicion of mother Forres- ter was stronger than of any one else, but she of course wasg as much surprised as he was himself, and swore most vehemently that she knew nothing at all of the matter. Bernard had no fear of Eveleen informing against him. He felt perfectly satisfied that after she had succeeded in getting clear of him, her love for his father would prevent her from being instrumental in subjecting him to an ignominious punishment. He was certain, however, that she would write home a full account of all that had happened, and he at once addressed a missive to Dr. Stykes, calling upon that individual to keep a sharp look-out and intercept any letters of her's which might make their appearance at the Dublin post office. One thing'worried him wonderfully. He was afraid that Eveleen might manage, in some way, to get a letter to Captain O'Rielly, before that gentleman sailed, in which case he knew there would be nothing left for him but to fly the city. He was relieved of this fear, though, the very day after Eveleen's escape, by reading the name 9f the brig Dart in the list of clearances, and a week thereafter he was overjoyed when mother Forrester placed into his hands s copy of the New York Sun, and pointed to the advertisement which had beeninserted by Mr. Baxter. "Now I will have her again," he said exultingly, " but I must not be in too great a hurry, for I may spoil all. Let me see- how shall I proceed?. She hasn't got much money with her, of that I'm certain, for she told Dick as much, and I'll take Eare that she don't get any from hornm The proba.   bility is, that by the time she recovers fom her sickness, she will insist upon paying foi the care which has been, taken of her, and then she must go to work. I must get sometody to watch her--find out where asb obtains employment, and lay my plans accord- ingly*" Contrary to the doctor's expectations, he succeeded, after considerable difficulty, in breaking Eveleen's fever, and at the expira- tion of a week she began to recover rapidly. The Baxter family had learned to look upon her with atfar different feeling from that with which they had at first regarded her, and by the time she was able to leave her bed, ste was considered as one of the fatrnily., She had told them as much of her hstory: as she dared, but she carefully avoided mentioning any names, or giving the kind old man who hadll taken her under his protection, any clue by which he could ferret out and bring to justice her unprincipled cousin, which he expressed a great desire to do. After our heroine had entirely recovered from her indisposition, she felt much easier in her mind, and eagerly looked forward to the period when she would receive an an- swer from her uncle to whom she had writ- ten some three or four letters, which, of course, never reachled hirm. Thle little stock of money which she had brought with her was nearly exhausted by the time she had got strong enough to think of working, and as she had expressed a desire to obtain some kind of emplyment, the two girls, Ellen and Charlotte -Baxter, who worked in a straw-sewing Establishment down town, spoke to their employer, who at once agreed to take her, and four weeks from the time she escaped from Bernardo she found herself regularly engaged as' a straw-sewer. At this occupation she remained about four months, during which time not a single line did she get from home, and she at length began to feel very uneasy She was satisfied that the letters must have miscarried, and her desire to return home had grown so strong withiin her, as to swallow up every other feeling save her love for Haviland, which instead of decreasing, daily grew , stronger. She was aware that at the rate of wages at which she was working, it would take her a long, long time to save  money sufficient to procure her a passage across the Atlantic, and she dreaded lest her 3 uncle should die during her protracted ab- i sence. She had almost forgotten that she I had any danger to fear from Bernard, for although she was fearful when she was first i informed of the advertisement which htad t been inserted in the Sun concerning her, - that ire might follow her up, she had naser i been troubled by him, and had at last come e to the conclusion that he had fled the city t under the impression that she would lodge - a complaint against him. She mistook the I  '  *    manr however, for Bernard, although no[p polrunity had offered to injure her, had neter lost sight of her-for a single moment. Eveleen, as I have already stated, had been engaged about four months at straw sewing, when one day a new applicant for employment presented herself at the estab- lishment in which she worked. She was a rather pretty girl, about seventeen years of age, anCd although she appeared very lady- like and modest, Eveleen could not help thinking, she knew not why, that her de- meaner was only assumed, and that under the mask of respectability she vore a cor rupt heart. She inwardly wishes, altfiough her heart reproached her for judging from t appearances, that the applicant would be rev l filsed work, but she was doomed. to dksp  pointment, for it was in the midst of a busy i season, and the girl, who gave her name as i Laura Lawrence, was  engaged at ones, and t commenced her labors' the very next day  Although Eveleen felt. such a repugnance f towards the new comer, and kept as far e; from her as possible, the rest of the young ladies in the establishment were very much ta taken with her, and wondered how anybody oould dislike her. She was so sociable and le good-natured. Besides, she wore fine rim clothes, a vast amount of jewelry, and only dr worked (so sh  e said) for amusement and st pocket Inoney. BIt a  lthough Eveleen kept at her at slrch  distance, and acted SO cool  towards her, she seemed to have conceived y\ a great affection for Eveleen, and let no op- ant portunit y slip to either highly c ompliment po her or do hler a favor of some kind .  it  Laura Lawrence    had been in the estab- me lishment about a week, when one day-Eve.

She saw that fi they all believed her guilty, for one by one a they turned from her without speaking. She u was recalled to a sense of her position, by y the forewoman, who, as she eft the shop, a told her that there would be no further oc- 1 casion for her services. "Lost! lost!"'she cried, while the tears X chased each other down her colorless cheeks, 3 as she took her way through the hall lead- c ing to the street. Oh, why, why am I thus i persecuted? What crime have I commit- k ted-how sinned--that I should be thus ma- t ,ignantlv pursued . No friend-not -one-- i they all all believed mle guilty-even 'Lotty! Oh,(od! my heart will break!'  At this moment she felt a light hand laid upon her shoulder, and turning around she  beheld 'Lotty Baxter, who had followed her. "Evy!" she said.  "'Lotty!' exclaimed Eveleen, and them next moment they fell into each other's arms, and wept violently. * ( Oh, Evy" sobbed 'Lotty, "you wasn't guilty of that bad action that was charged against you, was you ." "No, 'Lotty," answered Eveleen, as soon as she was able to speak, "as I hope for mercy, I am innocent!" "I knew i!" exclaimed 'Lotty, smiling through her tears. "T knew it, and I told 6ister Ellen so, but s8e wouldn't believe it." "Nobody will believe it but you,'Lotty, 6aid Eveleen, "not even your father; I feel satisfied of thi, because appearances are against me. I hjve never felt myself fully at liberty to explain to him everything con- cerbing my history, and from the fact of my not receiving answers to the letters which I have bent to Ireland, I know that his faith in my veracity has for a long time past been somewhat shaken. Now listen to me, 'Lot- ty. You have been a sister to me, axd I love you dearly; but to-morrow moring we must part, perhaps never to meet again!" "No, no, Evy!" cried Charlotte, clinging to her convulsively -"I cannot part from you in this way--have we notslept together  L-De we not sat side by side at work fox   as ^ - 0*^ four months?--and has a cross word, or etze a look of dissatisfaction ever passed between us t Besides, why should it be so I knwm you are innocent, and I will talk to Pa, my. self--he cannot--will not believe you guilty, I am certain."  "It will be in vain, 'Lotty," answered Evy, "and I want you to promise me that you will not attempt to bring us together. I cannot see your father---I feel that I have not nerve enough to bear up against a re, buke from him. I must sleep in your house to-night, for I have nowhere else to go, but in the morning I miust leave you." "And wlere will you go then?" asked Charlotte. "( Alas, I know not!" answered Eveleen, distractedly. "O would it were to my grave, if God would so will it!" It was dark when the two girls reached home. Eveleen went at once .to her bed- room, where she was soon afterwards joined by 'Lotty, who informed her that her suspi- cions as to what would be the opinions of her parents, were but too well founded. They lay awake sonme time, talking of the future. when atlength locked in each oth. ca' arms, they sobbed themselves to sleep. It was broad daylight when Eveleen awoke. 'Lotty was still fast asleep, and r gentlv disengaging herself from the sweet girl's embrace, our heroine arose, noiseless ' ly washed and dressed herself, and then care- ' fully arranging her hair, she bent over the I sleeper, and imprinting a kiss of holy love 3 upon her parted lips, she murmured--- r "God bless you, dear, dear 'Lotty!

Dr   Jm v JuJia CHAPTER XXVII.  W tx hate now nearly reached that point i Ereleen's career, when, as the reader wmill remember, rendered perfectly frantic by te persecution of her enemies, she threw herself into the river. It were useless to go into all the heart-rending,sickeing de tails of that persecution; and we shall miere- * y give a brief outline of the facts. The reader will already have divined that it was Be nard who employed the girl Laura .Law- * ten ;e to act the part she' did; and knowing full well that if Eveleon were disgraed, i she would not be permitted to remain id houa e of the family with whom she had ta-  ken xe'fuge,-he placed a paid creature of his d ---a disreputable oman---upon her trail to a wat h her movements. On thermorning si whe X she left Mr. Baxter's house, and again st wen, forth to seek for sympathy and com- hit pass on in thg cold world, this woman, who 8h Was early in the neighborhood, watching for to her, followed her until one saw her enter an m intelligence office in the Bowery, when.,she co folio red closely after her; and while Eve- ha !een stood trying to muster courage enough 80 to speak to the man in attendance, this woo he; man ,antered, a-nd expressed a desire to en- thi gage iome young woman of genteel address hor and g od education, as a companion for her daj daug Ser, 'who had recently returned home of from boarding-school. .

He had given' up all hope of making her his mis- tress, and began to wish that she was dead, for he feared that she might make known the particulars of his hellish proceedings Leaving him ad his fellow-plotters to their thoughts-which were not of the most plea- sant nature--an&amp; Eveleen-in the care of the philanthropic Jedediah Wood, we will now take a trip back t Ireland, where matters of great moment dCemand our attention. While our heroine was thus sadly perse- cuted in New York, Robert Wilson had re- ceived no tidings of her. Still he never gave up the hope of seeing her again. He * felt satisfied in his own mind that his son Bernard had been concerned in her abduc- tion, for he had discovered that the will which he had executed had been stolen, and t.. could not believe that Bernard would be jf murder. He argued,' therefore, en his guilty son had become satis- . that he could accomplish nothing by keeping her from him, he would allow her to return again. Mrs. Jackson, however, was not so sanguine, and had given up aii hope of ever again beholding her darling adopted. More than a year had passed after the abduction of Eveleen, when, one afternoon, as the farmer sat in his library, a nots, with- out a post-mark, was laid before him. Breaking the seal, he read as follows: ,s Mr. WILSON : Dear Sir,-Follow the bearer of this, and he will conduct you to the presence of ont \-ho is in the possession of secrets of the deepest inilort, con- cerning you and yours. Be quick, or you mayjarrive too late, for the person who is anxious to mnake these "sevealmenta is dying." There was no name signed to this note, and -Mr. Wilson, calling a servant, inquired who brought it. "It's a man, sir," was the answer, " an' he's below, sir." "Send him up," said Mr. Wilson. The servant departed, and. the next mo- ment a heavy footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Bill Stark entered the apartment. He wsore the same reckless air which had ever characterized him ; but he looked as though he had- seen hardr times. He was attired in pretty much the same fashion as when we first introduced him to the reader --in a shabby sailor's suit,-but his counte- nance was haggard, and he looked thin and emaciated. "Who is the writer of this note?" de- manded Mr. Wilson. "Z can answer no questions," was the re- ply,9Xiven in a sullen, dogged tone. "Then our conference may as well end at once, ' said Mr. Wilson. "I shall pay no atteDtion to it." "That's just as you please,"/* returned   Stark, carelessly; "it's very little I csa about it, though I thought I would do a good action once ip my life. Good evening!" and he turned upor. his heel to lea*! the room.              t  "Stay!" cried Mr. Wilson, whose curio- sity was greatly excited, although he endea- vored to appear calm; " to whom does the intelligence which I am to receive refer ", "As I told you before," said Stark, "1 can answer no questions. If you are dis- posed to go'with me,*come along-if not, I. will depart alone." "What security have I that you intend fair by me l" asked Mr. Wilson. "None," answered Stark, candidly- "you have no security except the word of a man whose veracity' would doubtless be questioned in a court of law, but it is the best you can have, and you are at liberty to take it o-r not?' "At least," said Mr. Wilson, "you will inform me where 1 am to go V'" "Yes," answered Stark, "and that's about all the information I will give you-- you are to go to Dublin. Decide quickly. I will answer no other'questions.--If it is your intention to accompany me, come at' once. If not, say so, and I will depart." "I will go," said the farmer, whose curi- osity had taken the place of every other feeling, and hastily preparing himself for the journey, they were soon upon their way. They rode silently along, each busy with his own thoughts. ' The farmer would fain . have conversed with his gloomy companion, X had he obser"ved any disposition on the part of Stark to talk, for hhe was burning with impatience to know what the business he was on would lead to, but if he ventured a question, it was answered either by a grunt or a monosyllable, and at length he made up his mind to await patiently the result. ';twas dark when they reached'Dublin. Tne sky, which tor some two hours had oeen. overcast, now put on a still more threatening aspect, and the low muttering of the far off thunder, bespoke a speedy shower. Clattering through the paved streets, Stark led the way in the direction of the Dublin Quays, and having arrived at -the house so often before, mentioned as being occupied by Nelly Blossom, Stark motioned the farmer to dismount, and having tied their horses to a, post, he knocked at the door which was soon opened by an old woe Inan, who bade them enter, carefully closed, locked and bolted, the -door after them, and then led the way up a narrow flight of stairs. and into a dark, dingy back room. A bed occupied one corner of the apartment, upon whichf lay Nelly Blossom in the agonies of death, while at the bedside was a chair, up- on which stood two or three phialscontaio ing medicines. A solita/ry lamp was burning dimly upon an old-fashioned oaken toUl   emitting about light enough t wnake the few article f furniture tih thie room indistinctly eisible, and the whole picture -was gloomy and dismal in the extreme.  A groan escaped the lips of the sufferer as Bill Stark and the farmer entered, and the latter shuddered with horror as he gazed upon her ghastly countenance. She beck- oned him towards her, and as he approached the bed, she said in a voice almost inaudible-- ', You're in time, farmer-draw up a chair and sit down-- have something to say to vou, and if I don't say it quick, the devil may grow impatient and call me before I've inished."  The farmer did as she desired, and she continued-= "Would you like to hear something of Eveleen Wlson '"t The farmer's heart beat tumultuously as he answered- "  O, yes, yes-for the love of God, if you know anything concerning her, reveal it, and you will be rewarded hereafter!"' ".Ha! ha!" laughed the wretched woman, i in a tone that made the blood curdle in the I farmer's veins, " rewarded hereafter! Yes, i in hell! T Do you suppose I don't know that  the devil is waiting for me? Why, I've  been talking with him this two hours, and! weve?come to be the greatest friends pose sible! There he is--do you see him ." and casting his eyes in the direction in 1 which she pointed, the farmer observed the a glaring eye-balls of a huge tom-cat that sat f crouching upon the hearth, looking towards t them---at the same moment a  vivid flash of i lightning lit up the room, which was imme- a diately followed by a crash of thunder that chook the house to its foundation-" ha!. 1. ha!" again laughed Nelly, ' he speaks loud- don't he?   O, yes-' he and me understand it each other, and I can't tell you anything for- ' the love of God, but I will tell you some- n thing for the love of revenge-pull out that tl table-drawer and tell me if you know the M handwriting of the letters you will find there" d The   farmer did as directed, and what was w hiu surprise at finding- about a dozen of ye Eveleen's letters, and about the same numro ti ber of Haviland's, every one of which had '1 been opened.              E "A portion of these are from my niece!" '1 -he exclaimed.,             c u I  know they are." replied Nelly,  " and wl they were intercepted by one who is to be thi the devil's right hand man-Dr. Stykes!, mi D-n hinm.!   tshall go a little before him. to -Out not long-!"            he U Wre'thed woman!" exclaimed the far- an mer, as he gazed with horror upon the ad ! tendish countenance of Nelly, '" what could wh Bhve Induced you to become a  party to such yvl rwikeessdf-  '      9 -   The same thing that induced me to be- : aa womea party to the kidnapping and sending mi Xe    few away of Eveleen Wils(n," she -anwerd Wtly "The same thing tat induced me to be- my .come a party to entrapping and procuring the conviction of William Haviland on a rer charge of robbery and attempt at murder- ind a charge of which he was as guiltless as zed you are!-- oney-money- m oney   - moneyis k- what induced ime to become a party to it, led but instead of money, I got poison!

"Is it possible that one so near death of can  think of nothing 'but revenge!" ex- claimed the farmer, in a tone of horror, as "terrible creature, think oF your crimes, and pray for forgiveness-shall I fetch you ou a priest "    . ,  nd  "A priest!" exclaimed Nelly, fixing her glazed eyes upon the farmer, "' have I not Ln, already told you that the devil is my con, he fessor?

"I don't want you to take my word for it9" answered Nelly, whose strength 'was fast giving way; " when I am dead, you will find in the trunk standing in yonder corner, the key of which is under my pillow, letters ]n his own hand-writing to prove what I say-but if you want farther proof, ask him who led you here, if it is not so.

"Ha! ha!" she laughed; "you are there again, are you? You are growing impatient, I perceive; well, well, I'll be with you instantly! Farmer," she continued, turning her eyes once more uponr the agon- ized listener, '"I don't want you to think that I've made this confession to ease my conscience--I've made it for revenge. They have played: me false, and now I am even with them." ,She was silent for a while, for pain seemed to entirely deprive her of the power of speech. At length, however, with an effort, she partly raised kerself in bed, and looking, towards Stark, -she said, "Come here, Bill; you are the only true man among 'em, after all, for there's no fear in you, and you've never deceived nme. Before I die, I want to caution you to leave Ireland as quick as possible ; for to-morrow a full statement of all our transactions will be put into the hands of the Chief Commis- sioner, and your safety may be endangered if you stay here." She seized .his hand as she finished speaking, and as the death- rattle gurgled in her throat, she fixed her eyes upon the glaring. optics oft the cat be- fore alluded to, which. seemingly thinking itself wanted, slowly arose, lazily approach- ed her. '"It's all up, Bill," she whispered ; "the time has come!-good-bye! T' ell-- Bernard-- Stykes -I-shall--meet--'em- in--h-l!"A crash louder than any which had preceded it, echoed in the vault of heaven, and with its rumbling, passed away the spirit of Nelly Blossom. CHAPTER XXVIII. THE farmers first care was to-secure the letters alluded to by Nelly, and while he was engaged .in this way, Bill Stark, after gazing long and solemnly at the dead body if Nelly, turned upon his heel and bect   the apartment, egclaining as he did me "Now for -California; where - sdl- have a wider fieffto practice in!" Robert Wilson, having obtained possession of all the documents alluded to, at once pro. ceeded, though as he thought of Bernard's perfidy with an almost broken heart, to fro- cure the liberation of Haviland. Having arranged this matter satisfactorily,,he re- turned to Kildare to settle some bargaine, after which it was- his intention to proceed at once to America, in \ search of Eveleen. Providence ordered, however, that his in- tention should be frustrated, for on reaching home, he was again taken seriously ill. The revelations that had been made to him had( seriously affected his nervous system ; and finding himself unable to endure a passage across the Atlantic, he wrote to Eveleen, (whose latest letter in the bunch- which he had secured, was written while shq was at work in the straw-sewing establishment) making her acquainted with the facts which hiad come to his knowledge, and advising her to return home. at once, unless the was so situated as to be -willing either to wait till he had recovered sufficiently to go after her, or till Haviland should return from exile. He ' enclosed a large remittance in the letter, placed it in charge of a gentleman about going to New York, whom he could trust, and then made up his mind to wait patiently the-termination of events, r W hen this letter in due course of time was put into the hands of Eveleen, she was filled with the keenest sensations of. both joy and grief--joy that her lover's innocence had been made"'manifest to the world, and grief that her uncle should be stretched upon a bed of sickness from being'obliged to publish the infamy of his own son. Ter first im- pulse on reading the letter was to take pas. sage for Ireland at once; but then she re. flected that she was very comfortably situ- ated. The members of the family with whom she had taken up her abode could not have treated her with more consideration had she been their own daughter, and'when sihethought of the terrible ordeal through which she had passed since leaving home, the idea of again venturing to take a y- o age alone, even under the most favorable circumstances, was frightful to her, and she determined, after mature deliberation, to stay where she was, till she could feel herself perfectly safe under the protection of either tier uncle or her lover. In the meantime, the lawyer into whoso hands Mr. Wilson had placed, Haviland's case, wrote immedialely to the young mant informing him of everything that had trans- pired from the time of his transportation up to the terrible revelation made by Nelly Blossom. The'letter' reached its destins- tion id something over three months from the date thereof, and -*hen Haviland 'receivld *    It the joy which he felt mere than recom. !pesed him for the long doubt and agonj which lihe had suffered.' By great good luck u fortunate -speculation had placed him in p"ssession of' a handsome competency, and he at once determined to start for New -York by way - of California; His blood boiled as he read the account of all that Eve- leen had suffered through Bernard's damna. ble machinations, and when he came to that portion of the letter in which the lawyer hinted that it was Eveleen's dishonor at which her cousin ained, he bit his lips till the blood came, and clutching the letter ner- vously in his hand, he raised his 'eyes to heaven, and in almost a tone of frenzy, ex- claimed, "Let him not die, just Heaven, till I see him! Deprive me not of the luxury of shedding his final blood! D.--d, des- picable, black-hearted fiend! Eveleen, dar- ling, persecuted girl; oh! that I could have -grappled the monster, when he dared to ad- vance his polluted lips toward yours!" We will now leave Haviland eta route for New York, via San Francisco, and return to Bernard Wilson, who, when he had found out that his own friends--Laura Lawrence, 'rind the woman who had taken Eveleen from the'intelligence office.-.had played him false, swore direct vengeance, upon then 'both. His first endeavor was to find out in what place Eveleen had taken refuge, and by dint of making strict inquiry in the neighborhood f of the residence of the physician who at- tended her, he learned from the servant-girl that she had gone off in company with a young lady who exactly answered the de- scription of Norah Burns. He concluded that -it was indeed Norah who had sought his *victim out, and offered her,an asylum in the house of Mr. Wood, and he determined to satisfy himself of the fact; so without ma- 'king his intention known to any one, he pro- ceeded alone, some weeks after Eveleen's attempt at self-destruction, to Jersey City, and loitered in the vicinity of the Quaker's residence in the hope of seeing Norah Burns, whom he had no doubt he could frighten in- to an admission of the truth, if such was in- deed the case. He had not waited long, when he was gratified at beholding Norah, who had come forth from the house with her child, for the purpose, evidently, of taking a walk. Getting ihtithe shade of a tree, he waited till she had got close up to him, and then discovered himself. Norah -uttered a slight screami, but instantly reovering her- self, she hushed the child, who, on witness- ing her mother's fright, had began to cry, and looking at Bernard, said  "Why do you follow me, Bernard? Have you not injured me enough already? I should think the deep wrongs you have fixed upon me would entitle me at least to exemp- ion ifrom your persecution." ^ I am not here to persepute you," he   L- eaids " but to gain information. I have on- y derstood that Eveleen Wilson has taken ', refuge under the roof that shelters you. Is n it so ." /' d  For a moment Norah hesitated, but at v length, heaving a deep sigh, she answered- d t"Bernard, had you waited a few days - longer -I should have given you information - by letter which I will now deliver by word t of mouth.  Eveleen Wilson has taken p refuge with us." t "And you will assist me to regain posses- 1 sion of her!" eagerly cried Bernard, who - from the candid manner in which- Norah a spoke, imagined that she had on some ac- - count conceived a dislike for Eveleen, and I was anxious to get rid of her. He was r  sBon undeceived, however, 'for Norah, fixing o upon him a lbok-of mingled sorrow and re proach, continued---  "O, Bernard, Bernard, I had fondly hoped - you might be led to repent of your crimes, but from what I have learned lately, I am r sure there is no probability of such a result i I have that to tell you which may well ex- i cite your fears as much as it does mine, , though from a different cause. I have told you before that I should grieve to know that the father of this child was the inmate of a felon's cell, but unless you leave ,this place, :and that speedily, such' will be the case. Eveleen has received a letterifrom Ireland which contains the information that a wo- man named Nelly BI ssom"---at te men- tion of this name Bernard started in affright, while Norah continued--" has died, making developements on her death-bed which will subject you, if you are apprehended, to a trial-on a Coarge of murder, besides detail- ing other horrible transactions in which you have been engaged. Already the officers of justice may be on their way here to ar- rest you-nay, they may be even now in New York. Fly, then, if you would escape the jibbet. Fly at once, and in some other locality endeavor to strike out a line of con- duct that may in some little measure cancel your past crimes."  Bernard stood perfectly chop-fallen. He was not prepared for what he had heard. He was certain it was true in every particu- lar, and he saw the necessity of immediate flight; and yet it galled him to fly, leaving Eveleen behind him,with a certainty that she would become the bride of Haviland after all. After, in hbls deep vexation, bitiPe his nails till the blood came, an idea seemend to strike him, and endeavoring to assume -a penitent look, he said- "Norah, I d0 feel that I have been a great villain, and I am-'anxious to make what re- paration it is yet in my power to make to my cousin. If I -can 8Se hIer but for a mo- ment, Hhave something of vital importame  to impart to her. Can yon notpersuadewer to accompany you here? I will notdtr  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7813-00000054"/> her long. I wish to have her forgiveness from her own lips. Persuade her to come, )ill -you, Norah 1"And as he spoke, he took the girl's soft hand in his:own, and pressed it with a show of tenderness. She shrank from his touch as though he was a leper, and looked steadily in his eye as if to detect some sign of contrition, but she could see none, and she felt sure that his ,penitence was but assumed. "I will deliver to Eveleen," she said, *' any message you may choose to send her, but I do not think she could be prevailed upon to see you." l I think you could manage it if you chose, Norah," said. Bernard, whining hypo- critically, "do persuade -her, it will be for your benefit as well as hers; and, as an earnest that I mean well, here is a relic which 1Shave had possession of for some years. I know that Eveleen prizes it above everything earthly, give it to her and say that I regret ever having deprived her of it." And he took from his vest the pocket cross which Tim Doyle had stolen from Eveleen, and placed it in the hand of Norah. t 6" will use all my endeavors to persuade her," said Norah; and as she turned to go, she -added, in a lower tone, '" to stay where she is" .  "Stay," said Bernard, into whose mind the suspicion had entered that Norah in- tended to play him false, "leave the child with me till you return." And he attempted to take the little girl by the hand, but she jumped away from him, and with a cry of affright, clung to her mother's dress. "She is timid, you see," said Noralh, i" and will not stay with any one but me." "Well," said Bernard, concealing his dis- appointment as well as he was able, " go, but don't keep me long waiting." Norah departed, and as soon as she was gone, Bernard placed his hand upon the han- dle of a dirk which was concealed ,in his bosom, and muttered,      ^'" "The chance is desperate, but I am will- ing to run a large risk for the sake of rob- bing' Bill Haviland of a wife. It is very lonesome here, and if I can succeed in stab- bing her suddenly, without any one observ- ing it, I think I may manage to escape, across the river, when I can secure passage aboard the steamer which sails for Panama toe-morrow, Once in California, I can with aslittle generalship, bid defiance to all law, Ibr, from what I can understand, there are a class of men there who are admirably suited to my purpose." An hour passed away, and yet there was no sign of the approach of either Norah or Eveleen. "Damnation!" growled the ruffian, " it is as I feared; "Norah, instead of persuading ier to come, has kept her from coming." He waited for another hour, and giving   i up all hope of accomplishing his object, l , muttered a smothered curse,- moodily took his way to the ferry, crossed the river, join- ed Pat Flanders, Tim Doyle, Dick Slocum., and Dr. Stykes, in the crib in Duane-street, informed them of, the unpleasant news which he had heard, and the next day the whole party took passage on board the steamer Cherokee, on the way to San Francisco CHAPTER XXIX. ABOUT six months after the death-bed confession of Nelly Blossom, a large party of men of ail grades, occupations, and coun- tries, were assembled around a long table in one of the rooms of a celebrated gambling saloon in San Francisco, known as the El Dorado, situated on Kearney-street, in tht Plaza, intent upon the. game of Monte ;*the players were principally diggers from the mines, and they staked their ounces upon the turn of a card with the utmost reckless- ness. There seemed to be a representative from almost every part of the world there-- the Sonorian, the Mexican, the native Cali- fornian, the Kanaka, the South-Sea Islander, the Chilian, the Peruvian, tihe Chinese, the Russian, the Australian, the Central Ameri- can, the Eucadonian,--ae American, from every State in the Union, the Frenchman, the Italian, the Portuguese, the Spaniard, the Buenos Ayrean, the Greek, the English (man, the Irishman, the Scotchman, the Ger- nman, etc., etc., all mingled together, all en- gaged in the same occupation; and although speaking a different, language, making them* selves perfectly intelligible to each other, on all matters relating to gambling Among the party assembled was one individual who seemed to have had an extremely bad run of luck, he lost stake after stake, as fast aU he put it down; and at length, losing all pa- tience, he staked his last ounce upon a card, and lost. "Go and be d--d!" he said, as he leftthe table, and went towards the door, which opened as he reached it, and he met another individual who was about entering, face to face. For a moment they gazed at each other without speaking, but at length he who had just retired from the game, held out his hand exclaiming, as he drew a long breath- "Well, Wilson, I didn't expect to meetyow here!." "Nor I you, Stark," answered Bernard, for he it was, 1 and our meeting, to me, is as agreeable as it is unexpected-what have you been doing, and how as -fortune used you since we parted I'" "Well," answered Stark, " for some tim after I left you, I stuck to. the old busjiedn but at last .I grew somewhat tired -of i4 Hi   thought I would try to live honestly. 1 Pact is, I never felt exactly right about that matter concerning Haviland, so I went to Ireland, for the purpose of acknowledging my share .in the transaction-when I got there, I found that Stykes had poisoned Nelly and fled. I didn't like this breach of good faith, so I made a clean breast of the matter, brought your father to her bedside, and immediately afterwards made myself searce and came here, where I went to digging. I succeeded'.in getting together about a thousand dollars, and I have just lost a every mill of it at monte." "Well, Bill," - said Bernard, reprovingly, you're the last man I should have suspect- c ed of informing against me after the promises i you made on leaving me."  "It was not my intention to do so when I o went to Ireland," answered Stark, " if you I had acted fairly by Nell, your name would a never have been mentioned-but the DjEtor c told me with his own lips that you advied V him to the course he took, and I thought that X as you had acted treacherously towards her, t I would be perfectly justified in helping her f to obtain satisfaction."        f S' The Doctor lied!" exclaimed Bernard, \ whose face grew crimson with rage, " and 8 I see now that he was all along playing a e double game-robbing Nelly and deceiving v me. - But"--and here. a grim smile of t satisfaction played upon his devilish visage r --" he is past deceiving anybody now." d "How so ." inquired Bill, " has he gone h tender?"   .O "Yes," answered Berriard, "I lost two tl of the companions who started with me o from New York on the way here.  One of ii them-Dick Slocumb, a man whom I believe a you have never seen-jumped overboard in d a fit of delirium tremens and was drowned, M and the doctor was taken down by fever on su the Isthmus. He was in such agony that is he begged me  for Christ's sake to kill him. la and as I  was fearful that he might in his le delirium, - say something that might not tl reflect much credit upon me, I accommodated be him, by smothering him."        to "How have vou made out since you came en here -' inquired Stark.    .    tv "Poorly," answered Bernard, "I have hi done nothing as yet. Tim has succeeded hi in stealing enough to keep us afloat, and lit Pat and myself have been looking around se for a  chance to make something, but no sh Opportunity has yet offered."     w - Well," maid Stark, "I never intend to up labor for my living again-I've come to the conclusion that honesty's a humbug, and I'm da determined to make a  raise to-night if I pi rwing foir it. Do you see that greasy-looking S1 thief there?," be said. turning his eyes in the m diretion .of the table which he had left, and th uing-them upon a  Mexican who was raking N  file which he had won        ea   it - Bernard nodded affirmatively. it "Well," continued Stark, 6" he's had the o greatest streak of luck imaginable. The g devil seems to favor him, for I havn't seen It him lose once. He: must be some ten d thousand dollars winner, and he don't look to B F me as if he had a family that would grieve e if he didn't take it home. Now, I'm in A, favor of helping him' to carry it." f ' Good enough," said Bernard, "you stay o here, while I go after Pat and Tim. It's r best for us to have help enough in case he t should have friends.' I shan't be gone long, for they are hard by here waiting for me." , He started off and soon returned with his - companions, who were overjoyed at'once- B more finding themselves in the company of Stark, and after their mutual greetings were [ over, they stationed themlselves at various ipoints around the table t4 watch the game, I and to wait until their victim should take his rdeparture. They were soon gratified, for Ithe Mexican, whose luck began to change, t gathered up what money he had, and- left the house, in company with two compatdion%, for his residence, whichl Jay about a mile from  the Mission Dolores, a small village which lay about four miles to the south of- San Francisco, and at the head of the valley Lof Santa Clara. The Mexicans. were all well armed, and at first Stark questioned the propriety of attacking them. Naturally reckless, however, and influenced to the deed 4y the reflection that le was penniless, he urged upon his companions the necessity of the strictest caution in the prosecution of the enterprise, and as the MexicAs passed out and took their way up Kearny Hills ly- ing on the other side of Happy Valley, Stark and his companions followed them at a safe distance. There is a locality leading to- the Mission Road, presenting a  very uneven surface, and composed of hills of brus.  T is a  very lonely place, and admirably calcu- lated for the performance of a deed of vio lence. In this direction the Mexicans bent their steps; and Stark, seeing that it wou' be safer to attack theia from an ambush thai to go up behind them, succeeded, by quick ening his pace to a run, and threading some two or three valleys, in placing himself and his companions, under the cover of some brush, just ahead of the Mexicans on the line of their route. Here stationing them- selves, Stark gave directions that they should all, fire at once, when he gave the word, and -then make a  simultaneous rush upon the victims. On came the Mexicans, unsuspecting of danger, and when they had Reached the place where the miscreants lay concealed, Stark gave the word in a whisper, and imr mediately the isport of their pistols broke the stillness that till then had reigned Bround. Neitheri shot waS fatal, however, although each of the Mexicans sustained a fLe&amp;   &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7813-00000055"/> wound, and determined not to fight if there was an opportunity to run, they raised a wild cry, and immediately took to their heels, closely followed by their pursuers, who gained rapidly upon them, and they were at length compelled toturn and fight,' which they did, desperately. The conflict was a close and bloody- one, for the Mexi- cans, who, as we haie stated,'were well armed, fought with the fury of wild beasts, while the robbers, having once engaged in the affair, were no less reckless and deter- mined. In about five minutes after the at- tack was made, Bill Stark, Pat Flanders, and two of the Mexicans,'were lying motion- less upon the ground, literally cut to pieces; and the only contention was between Ber- nard Wilson, assisted by-the boy Tim, and the Mexican whq had been so successful at gambling, and who still fought with thefuiry of desperation. The two men were closely grappling each other in the death struggle, and just, as the boy Tim, was aiming a tremendous blow wittfa bowie-knife at the head of the Mexi- can, a pistol ball went crashing through his (Tim's) skull, and he fell dead to the earth. At the same time, Bernard succeeded in liberating one of his hands, and buried a clasp-knife up to the hilt in the heart of the Mexican; but as he pushed the body from him, he felt himself grappled by a new actor who had appeared upon the scene, and turn- ing around he discovered, by the light of the moon, the face of William Haviland. It was an unexpected meeting to -both, and they gazed- at each other as though they could hardly believe they saw aright. The expression which at length settled upon the face of Bernard was one of fear, while the countenance of William Haviland lighted up with a look of almost savage exultation. The Father was the first to find speech, and grasping Bernard, who in his affright had dropped the -bloody knife which he had just pulled from the heartiof the Mexican, and started to run, tightly by the throat, he ex- claimed- "At length, Bernard Wilson, my prayer is answeredt I have wished-Oh, how I have wished for this moment to arrive!" "Give me an equal chance," growled Bernird, struggling desperately, ' and I will fight you'!" "An equal chance!" roared Haviland, With the fury of a maniac, " will the travel. worn hunter give the wild hyena an equal chance! Did you listen to the pleading of- my love--my Eveleen--when she with Streaming eyes and agonized utterance, ap- pealed to you fior mercy! Did you not laugh abher prayers and entreaties, and did you lot dare to pollute her pure lips with gouw vile contamirt ting breath! Damned, black-hearted wei execrable wretch. Ohi {tit I had it in :t TFer   o make you live a i tr vv         thousand years, and die hourly i it nerI torture! An'equal chance-!"he reiterated, bearing the trembling wretch with mania0 force to the earth, and drawing -a poignard from his bosom. '"No, you shall die the 'death of a mad dog!" and he was about plunging the weapon into the breast of the helpless wretch, when he observed, by the moonlight, that his jaw had dropped, and that his eyes were set in his head, and were staring upon him with the vacant expression of death. The wounds that Bernard had received from the Mexicans had proved of a mortal character; and, after drawing a long breath, he made an ineffectual attempt to rise, the death rattle sounded in his ithroat, and straightening himself out, the rigidity of his features and limbs soon showed that the vital spark'had fled. "Thank Heavean! exclaimed Haviland, as he dropped his up. lifted arm, "I am saved from being a mur. derer!" and raising himself from the body, his long pent-up vengeance being satiated, he trembled as if attacked by an ague fit, and burst into a passionate flood of tears. After he was somewhat composed,-he ral- lied himself and proceeded to turn the fea- tures of the prostrate mer, .round him up to the- moon's light, when he at once recog- nized, much to his surprise, the feajures of Stark, Flanders, and the boy Tim,'all of whom were quite dead, as were likewise the Mexicans, whose bodies were mutilated in a most horrible manner. "You. have 'met with a just punishment at last," he said, as he turned to leave the spot, "' though your bodies would have better graced a scaffold than a battle ground, even though the battle were for plunder."  '      , i One evening, about a month after the oe. currence just narrated took place, Eveleen i Wilson and Norah Burns sat in the drawing I room of Mr. Wood's residence in Jersey t City. They were talking over past events, i and indulging in pleasant anticipations -of the future. Eveleen had that day received two letters-one from her uncle, in which rhe stated that he had nearly recovered from his severe indisposition, and the other from Haviland, which notified her that he was on I the point of starting for* New York, and I would most probably arrive nearly as soon as his letter would. The letters had lain in , the post-office for two or three days, and Eveleen hourly expected her lover, for she I knew he would not delay his coming a mo- m sent longer than he could possibly help. I Sfie was consequently very happy, and her - appearance would hardly indicate that ahe t had passed, through all the trials and surfei ings which had for years -afflicted her., i " O, we shall be solhappy, dear NKoiaht*i , she exclaimed, then suddenly pausing, she i added, "-you will go with us to Ireland, Wm a you not 2l"   A 'tear glistened in the eye of Norah, as she answered- f Ah, no, dear Eveleen-there js no charm in Ireland for me now. It -would break my heart to look upon the home of my child- hood again, flr it would, recall to my recol- lection events which I wdild fain forget." "It is not my intention So stay there," szid Eveleen, {' unless William is anxious to do so, but I must return to see my uncle, Mrs. Jackson, old Biddy and all the rest who have been kind to me, and then I shall make this country my home. You will live with us, then, won't you V" "How do you know that my company would be agreeable to your husband?" said Norah, forcing a smile, "you forget that there are two of you." 'Indeed -I do not," answered Eveleen, "I feel certain that William will love as a brother anybody who has ever befriended lie." "Well, time will determine," said Norah, - and let what will happen, I shall always be your friend l "And I yours!" exclaimed Eveleen, fer- tently. At this moment, the hall bell rang violent- I, ly, and Norah, who sat nearest the door, started to answer'it, while Eveleen bent her head forward, and listened eagerly. She heard her name mentioned by a voice which she could 'not mistake, and bounding fr mI Oer chair, she flew towards the sound of it, and meeting her lover half way in the hall, she fell, laughing hysterically, ;n his aus.  i"Beat heart, but break not!" exclaimed I Haviland, as he pressed her wildly to his ' i bosom.  Oh, how often, in the' ca'rn Iwi.  light of a Sydney evening have I, in llagL- i nation. held you thus in my arms, and glazed  in ecstacy upon your guileless face!  Not a all the combined ills that misfortune has seen X fit to shower upon me since the first tore I you from my embrace, could equal in inten- 1 sity the delirium of joy which I, in this one f moment, experience! O Eveleen, belove, e darling Eveleeln! is there love in Heaven a -equal to this "            t" She could not answer him; she could only c creep closer to his bosom, and ween for joy. a Norahj who considered such a :reeting as i) sacred, had withdrawn from the room, and a it was nearly an hour efore Eveleen's feel. X ings were subdued sufficiently to admit of a her conversing with colness, when she re. a lated over to Haviland every thing which ol 'she had passed through. During her reci- w tal of Bernard's persecutions, the fiuscles a Of Haviland's face twitehed fearfully, and he at felt that the fiend-like passion which took G possession. of hint, when -he slew Bernard, to was returning.      .      r ' Speaik not of him, love," he said; the at mention of his -detested name seems to con- cc   as vert my better feelings ihtp bitter gall. He can never injUre y,^o again, so,let him rest." m  "tIs he dead?" questioned Eveleen, with iy a shudder. -  "He is," -said Haviland ; and as he did I- not wish that Eveleel eilould know by whose hand her cousin died, he added, " he ," was killed, as were also his friends, Stark, to Flanders, and the boy Tim, while endear- e, oring to rob a party of Mexicans in Cal. It fornid." "; My poor uncle!" exclaimed Evqleen, e "how it would grieve him if he knew it! ' And Norah, too, poor girl!" y  "The  need neither of them- know it," d said Haviland, '" let them remain in blis ,t ful ignorance of his fate. As for NoO, the dear young lady who has so befriended i, you---a tear from her to the memory uo a such a man, would seem like grief from a d saint for the downfall of Satan.." Thus did Haviland and Eveleen con. i, verse till day-light crept in at the windows, 8 when the lover took his departure for the hotel in New York at which he had put - up, and Eveleen went to bed to dream of Haviland and happiness. I have now, dear reader, nearly finished i, the narrative-of the sufferings of Eveleen r Wilson. I might write a volume yet (but e- it is useless, and therefore I shall not do it,) h in stating how Eveleen and Haviland were I married just one week after the latter'y , arrival in New York --how Charlotte Bav , ter, to whom Eveleen took the earliest op- portunity of  introducing Haviland-.offi- i elated as bride's-maid, while a very nice I voung man of Charlotte's acquaintance, who afterwards prevailed. upon her to change her name, acted as grooms'iman--how   thev Ishortly afterwards made a trip to Ireland and were received 'by their friends with every demonstration of delight---how old Robert Wilson, from disliking Haviland, learned to regard him as one of the finest fellows in the world---how old Biddy Ryau expressed her entire willingness to lay down and die,i if she could only be allowed to at- tend the first christ'ning--.how the young couple afterwards returned to this country and settled in the Stateof Pennsylvania, not far fromn Alleghany County, where they, at the present writing, together with Norah Burns and her little daughter, reside, and are occasionally visited by Jedediah Wood and his good lady.-.how Captain Sharkey, of the Flirt, together with his whole crew, was lost il a storm on the Irish coast-how , Mag.
