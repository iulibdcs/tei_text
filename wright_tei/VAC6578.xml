            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS is a collection of ten Christmas Stories, some of which have been published
               before. I have added a little essay, written on the occasion of the first Christmas
               celebrated by the King of Italy in Rome.</p>
            <p>The first story has never before been published.</p>
            <p>It is but fair to say that I have not drawn on imagination for Laura's night duty,
               alone upon her island. This is simply the account of what a brave New-England woman
               did, under like circumstances, because it was the duty next her hand.</p>
            <p>If any reader observes a resemblance between her position and that of a boy in
               another story in this volume, I must disarm censure, by saying, that she had never
               heard of him when she was called to this duty, and that I had never heard of her when
               I wrote his story.</p>

                  <p>"HERE he comes! here he comes!" "He" was the "post-rider," an institution now
                     almost of the past. He rode by the house and threw off a copy of the "Boston
                     Gazette." Now the "Boston Gazette," of this particular issue, gave the results
                     of the drawing of the great Massachusetts State Lottery of the Eastern Lands in
                     the Waldo Patent.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Cutts, the elder, took the "Gazette," and opened it with a smile that
                     pretended to be careless; but even he showed the eager anxiety which they all
                     felt, as he tore off the wrapper and unfolded the fatal sheet. "Letter from
                     London," "Letter from Philadelphia," "Child with two heads,"—thus he ran down
                     the columns of the little page,—uneasily. "Here it is! here it is!—Drawing of
                     the great State<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6578-00000007"/> Lottery. 'In the
                     presence of the Honourable Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and of their Honours
                     the Commissioners of the Honourable Council,—was drawn yesterday, at the State
                     House, the first distribution of numbers'——here are the numbers,—'First
                     combination, 375-1. Second, 421-7. Third, 591-6. Fourth, 594-1. Fifth,'"—and
                     here Mr. Cutts started off his feet,—"'Fifth, 219-7.' Sybil, my darling! it is
                     so! 219-7! See, dear child! 219-7! 219-7! O my God! to think it should come
                     so!"</p>
                  <p>And he fairly sat down, and buried his head in his hands, and cried.</p>
                  <p>The others, for a full minute, did not dare break in on excitement so intense,
                     and were silent; but, in a minute more, of course, little Simeon, the youngest
                     of the tribes who were represented there, gained courage to pick up the paper,
                     and to spell out again the same words which his father had read with so much
                     emotion; and, with his sister Sally, who came to help him, to add to the store
                     of information, as to what prize number 5—219-7—might bring.</p>
                  <p>For this was a lottery in which there were no blanks. The old Common wealth of
                     Massachusetts setts, having terrible war debts to pay after the Revolution, had
                     nothing but lands in Maine to pay them with. Now lands in Maine were not very
                     salable, and, if the simple and ordinary process of sale had been followed, the
                     lands might not have been sold till this day. So they were distributed by these
                     Lotteries, which in that time seemed gigantic. Every ticket-holder had some
                     piece of land awarded to him, I think,—but to the most, I fear, the lands were
                     hardly worth the hunting up, to settle upon. But, to induce as many to buy as
                     might, there were prizes. No. 1, I think, even had a "stately mansion" on the
                     land,—according to the advertisement. No. 2 had some special water-power
                     facilities. No. 5, which Mr. Cutts's ticket had drawn, was two thousand acres
                     on Tripp's Cove,—described in the programme as that "well-known Harbor of
                     Refuge, where Fifty Line of Battle Ship could lie in safety." To this cove the
                     two thousand acres so adjoined that the programme represented them as the site
                     of the great "Mercantile Metropolis of the Future."</p>
                  <p>Samuel Cutts was too old a man, and had already tested too critically his own
                     powers in what the world calls "business," by a sad satire,<pb n="4-5"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000008"/> to give a great deal of faith to the promises of
                     the prospectus, as to the commercial prosperity of Tripp's Cove. He had come
                     out of the Revolution a Brigadier-General, with an honorable record of
                     service,—with rheumatism which would never be cured,—with a good deal of paper
                     money which would never be redeemed, which the Continent and the Commonwealth
                     had paid him for his seven years,—and without that place in the world of peace
                     which he had had when these years began. The very severest trial of the
                     Revolution was to be found in the condition in which the officers of the army
                     were left after it was over. They were men who had distinguished themselves in
                     their profession, and who had done their very best to make that profession
                     unnecessary in the future. To go back to their old callings was hard. Other men
                     were in their places, and there did not seem to be room for two. Under the
                     wretched political system of the old Confederation there was no such rapid
                     spring of the material prosperity of the country as should find for them new
                     fields in new enterprise. Peace did any thing but lead in Plenty. Often indeed,
                     in history, has Plenty been a little coy before she could be tempted, with her
                     pretty tender feet, to press the stubble and the ashes left by the havoc of
                     War. And thus it was that General Cutts had returned to his old love whom he
                     had married in a leave of absence just before Bunker Hill, and had begun his
                     new life with her in Old Newbury in Massachusetts, at a time when there was
                     little opening for him,—or for any man who had spent seven years in learning
                     how to do well what was never to be done again.</p>
                  <p>And in doing what there was to do he had not succeeded. He had just squeezed
                     pork and potatoes and Indian meal enough out of a worn-out farm to keep Sybil,
                     his wife, and their growing family of children alive. He had, once or twice,
                     gone up to Boston to find what chances might be open for him there. But, alas,
                     Boston was in a bad way too, as well as Samuel Cutts. Once he had joined some
                     old companions, who had gone out to the Western Reserve in Northern Ohio, to
                     see what opening might be there. But the outlook seemed unfavorable for
                     carrying so far, overland, a delicate woman and six little children into a
                     wilderness. If he could have scraped together a little money, he said, he would
                     buy a share in one of the ships he saw<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6578-00000009"/>
                     rotting in Boston or Salem, and try some foreign adventure. But, alas! the
                     ships would not have been rotting had it been easy for any man to scrape
                     together a little money to buy them. And so, year in and year out, Samuel Cutts
                     and his wife dressed the children more and more plainly, bought less sugar and
                     more molasses, brought down the family diet more strictly to pork and beans,
                     pea-soup, hasty-pudding, and rye-and-indian,—and Samuel Cutts looked more and
                     more sadly on the prospect before these boys and girls, and the life for which
                     he was training them.</p>
                  <p>Do not think that he was a profligate, my dear cousin Eunice, because he had
                     bought a lottery ticket. Please to observe that to buy lottery tickets was
                     represented to be as much the duty of all good citizens, as it was proved to
                     be, eleven years ago, your duty to make Have-locks and to knit stockings.
                     Samuel Cutts, in the outset, had bought his lottery ticket only "to encourage
                     the others," and to do his honorable share in paying the war debt. Then, I must
                     confess, he had thought more of the ticket than he had supposed he would. The
                     children had made a romance about it,—what they would do, and what they would
                     not do, if they drew the first prize. Samuel Cutts and Sybil Cutts themselves
                     had got drawn into the interest of the children, and many was the night when
                     they had sat up, without any light but that of a pine-torch, planning out the
                     details of the little colony they would form at the Eastward,—if—if only one of
                     the ten great prizes should, by any marvel, fall to him. And now Tripp's
                     Cove—which, perhaps, he had thought of as much as he had thought of any of the
                     ten—had fallen to him. This was the reason why he showed so much emotion, and
                     why he could hardly speak, when he read the numbers. It was because that had
                     come to him which represented so completely what he wanted, and yet which he
                     had not even dared to pray for. It was so much more than he expected,—it was
                     the dream of years, indeed, made true.</p>
                  <p>For Samuel Cutts had proved to himself that he was a good leader of men. He
                     knew he was, and many men knew it who had followed him under Carolina suns, and
                     in the snows of Valley Forge. Samuel Cutts knew, equally well, that he was not
                     a good maker of money, nor creator of pork and potatoes. Six years of farming
                        in<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6578-00000010"/> the valley of the Merrimac had
                     proved that to him, if he had never learned it before. Samuel Cutts's dream had
                     been, when he went away to explore the Western Reserve, that he would like to
                     bring together some of the best line officers and some of the best privates of
                     the old "Fighting Twenty-seventh," and take them, with his old provident skill,
                     which had served them so well upon so many camping-grounds, to some region
                     where they could stand by each other again, as they had stood by each other
                     before, and where sky and earth would yield them more than sky and earth have
                     yet yielded any man in Eastern Massachusetts. Well! as I said, the Western
                     Reserve did not seem to be the place. After all, "the Fighting Twenty-seventh"
                     were not skilled in the tilling of the land. They furnished their quota when
                     the boats were to be drawn through the ice of the Delaware, to assist in Rahl's
                     Christmas party at Trenton. Many was the embarkation at the "head of Elk," in
                     which the "Fighting Twenty-seventh" had provided half the seamen for the
                     transport. It was "the Fighting Twenty-seventh" who cut out the "Princess
                     Charlotte" cutter in Edisto Bay. But the "Fighting Twenty-seventh" had never,
                     so far as any one knew, beaten one sword into one plough-share, nor one spear
                     into one pruning-hook. But Tripp's Cove seemed to offer a different prospect.
                     Why not, with a dozen or two of the old set, establish there, not the New
                     Jerusalem, indeed, but something a little more elastic, a little more helpful,
                     a little more alive, than these kiln-dried, sun-dried, and time-dried old towns
                     of the seaboard of Massachusetts? At any rate, they could live together in
                     Tripp's Cove, as they wintered together at Valley Forge, at Bennett's Hollow,
                     by the Green Licks, and in the Lykens Intervale. This was the question which
                     Samuel Cutts wanted to solve, and which the fatal figures 219-7 put him in the
                     way of solving.</p>
                  <p>"Tripp's Cove is our Christmas present," said Sybil Cutts to her husband, as
                     they went to bed. But so far removed were the habits of New England then from
                     the observance of ecclesiastical anniversaries, that no one else had remembered
                     that day that it was Christmas which was passing.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">TRIPP'S COVE.</head>
                  <p>CALL this a long preface, if you please, but it seems to me best to tell this
                     story so that I may explain what manner of people those were and are who lived,
                     live, and will live, at Tripp's Cove,—and why they have been, are, and will be
                     linked together, with a sort of family tie and relationship which one does not
                     often see in the villages self-formed or formed at hap-hazard on the seaside,
                     on the hillside, or in the prairies of America. Tripp's Cove never became "the
                     Great Mercantile City of the Future," nor do I believe it ever will. But there
                     Samuel Cutts lived in a happy life for fifty years,—and there he died, honored,
                     blessed, and loved. By and by there came the second war with England,—the
                     "Endymion" came cruising along upon the coast, and picking up the fishing-boats
                     and the coasters, burning the ships on the stocks, or compelling the owners to
                     ransom them. Old General Cutts was seventy years old then; but he was, as he
                     had always been, the head of the settlement at Tripp's,—and there was no lack
                     of men younger than he, the sergeants or the high-privates of the "Fighting
                     Twenty-seventh," who drilled the boys of the village for whatever service might
                     impend. When the boys went down to Runkin's and sent the "Endymion's" boats
                     back to her with half their crews dead or dying, faster than they came, old
                     General Cutts was with them, and took sight on his rifle as quickly and as
                     bravely as the best of them. And so twenty years more passed on,—and, when he
                     was well nigh ninety, the dear old man died full of years and full of
                     blessings, all because he had launched out for himself, left the life he was
                     not fit for, and undertaken life in which he was at home.</p>
                  <p>Yes! and because of this also, when 1861 came with its terrible alarm to the
                     whole country, and its call to duty, all Tripp's Cove was all right. The girls
                     were eager for service, and the boys were eager for service. The girls stood by
                     the boys, and the boys stood by the girls. The husbands stood by the wives, and
                     the wives stood by the husbands. I do not mean that there was not many another
                     community in which everybody was steadfast and true. But I do mean that here
                     was one great family, although the census rated it as five-and-twenty
                        families,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6578-00000012"/> —which had one heart and
                     one soul in the contest, and which went into it with one heart and one
                     soul,—every man and every woman of them all bearing each other's burdens.</p>
                  <p>Little Sim Cutts, who broke the silence that night when the post-man threw down
                     the "Boston Gazette," was an old man of eighty-five when they all got the news
                     of the shots at Fort Sumter. The old man was as hale and hearty as are half the
                     men of sixty in this land to-day. With all his heart he encouraged the boys who
                     volunteered in answer to the first call for regiments from Maine. Then with
                     full reliance on the traditions of the "Fighting Twenty-seventh," he explained
                     to the fishermen and the coasters that Uncle Abraham would need them for his
                     web-footed service, as well as for his legions on the land. And they found out
                     their ways to Portsmouth and to Charlestown, so that they might enter the navy
                     as their brothers entered the army. And so it was, that, when Christmas came in
                     1861, there was at Tripp's Cove only one of that noble set of young fellows,
                     who but a year before was hauling hemlock and spruce and fir and pine at
                     Christmas at the girls' order, and worked in the meeting-house for two days as
                     the girls bade them work, so that when Parson Spaulding came in to preach his
                     Christmas sermon, he thought the house was a bit of the woods themselves. Only
                     one!</p>
                  <p>And who was he?</p>
                  <p>How did he dare stay among all those girls who were crying out their eyes, and
                     sewing their fingers to the bones,—meeting every afternoon in one sitting-room
                     or another, and devouring every word that came from the army? They read the
                     worst-spelled letter that came home from Mike Sawin, and prized it and blessed
                     it and cried over it, as heartily as the noblest description of battle that
                     came from the pen of Carleton or of Swinton.</p>
                  <p>Who was he?</p>
                  <p>Ah! I have caught you, have I? That was Tom Cutts,—the old General's
                     great-grandson,—Sim Cutts's grandson,—the very noblest and bravest of them all.
                     He got off first of all. He had the luck to be at Bull Run,—and to be cut off
                     from his regiment. He had the luck to hide under a corn crib, and to come into
                     Washington whole, a week after the regiment. He was the first man in Maine,
                     they said, to enlist for the three-years' service. Perhaps the same<pb
                        n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6578-00000013"/> thing is said of many others. He had
                     come home and raised a new company,—and he was making them fast into good
                     soldiers, out beyond Fairfax Court-House. So that the Brigadier would do any
                     thing Tom Cutts wanted. And when, on the first of December, there came up to
                     the Major-General in command a request for leave of absence from Tom Cutts,
                     respectfully referred to Colonel This, who had respectfully referred it to
                     General That, who had respectfully referred it to Adjutant-General T'other,—all
                     these dignitaries had respectfully recommended that the request be granted. For
                     even in the sacred purlieux of the top Major-General's Head-quarters, it was
                     understood that Cutts was going home for no less a purpose than the being
                     married to the prettiest and sweetest and best girl in Eastern Maine.</p>
                  <p>Well! for my part I do not think that the aids and their informants were in the
                     wrong about this. Surely that Christmas Eve, as Laura Marvel stood up with Tom
                     Cutts in front of Parson Spaulding, in presence of what there was left of the
                     Tripp's Cove community, I would have said that Laura was the loveliest bride I
                     ever saw. She is tall; she is graceful; she has rather a startled look when you
                     speak to her, suddenly or gently, but the startled look just bewitches you.
                     Black hair,—she got that from the Italian blood in her grandmother's
                     family,—exquisite blue eyes,—that is a charming combination with black
                     hair,—perfect teeth,—and matchless color,—and she had it all, when she was
                     married,—she was a blushing bride and not a fainting one. But then what stuff
                     this is,—nobody knew he cared a straw for Laura's hair or her cheek,—it was
                     that she looked "just lovely," and that she was "just lovely,"—so
                     self-forgetful in all her ways, after that first start,—so eager to know just
                     where she could help, and so determined to help just there. Why! she led all
                     the girls in the village, when she was only fourteen, because they loved her
                     so. She was the one who made the rafts when there was a freshet,—and took them
                     all out together on the mill-pond. And, when the war came, she was of course
                     captain of the girl's sewing,—she packed the cans of pickles and fruit for the
                     Sanitary,—she corresponded with the State Adjutant:—heavens! from morning to
                     night, everybody in the village ran to Laura,—not because she was the
                        prettiest<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6578-00000014"/> creature you ever looked
                     upon,—but because she was the kindest, truest, most loyal, and most helpful
                     creature that ever lived,—be the same man or woman.</p>
                  <p>Now had you rather be named Laura Cutts or Laura Marvel? Marvel is a good
                     name,—a weird, miraculous sort of name. Cutts is not much of a name. But Laura
                     had made up her mind to be Laura Cutts after Tom had asked her about it,—and
                     here they are standing before dear old Parson Spaulding, to receive his
                     exhortation,—and to be made one before God and man.</p>
                  <p>Dear Laura! How she had laughed with the other girls, all in a good-natured
                     way, at the good Parson's exhortation to the young couples. Laura had heard it
                     twenty times,—for she had "stood up" with twenty of the girls, who had dared
                     The Enterprise of Life before her! Nay, Laura could repeat, with all the
                     emphasis, the most pathetic passage of the whole,—"And above all,—my beloved
                     young friends,—first of all and last of all,—let me beseech you as you climb
                     the hill of life together, hand with hand, and step with step,—that you will
                     look beyond the crests upon its summit to the eternal lights which blaze in the
                     infinite heaven of the Better Land beyond." Twenty times had Laura heard this
                     passage,—nay, ten times, I am afraid, had she, in an honest and friendly way,
                     repeated it, under strict vows of secrecy, to the edification of circles of
                     screaming girls. But now the dear child looked truly and loyally into the old
                     man's face, as he went on from word to word, and only thought of him, and of
                     how noble and true he was,—and of the Great Master whom he represented
                     there,—and it was just as real to her and to Tom Cutts that they must look into
                     the Heaven of heavens for life and strength, as Parson Spaulding wanted it to
                     be. When he prayed with all his heart, she prayed; what he hoped, she hoped;
                     what he promised for her, she promised to her Father in heaven; and what he
                     asked her to promise by word aloud, she promised loyally and eternally.</p>
                  <p>And Tom Cutts? He looked so handsome in his uniform,—and he looked like the man
                     he was. And in those days, the uniform, if it were only a flannel
                     fatigue-jacket on a private's back, was as beautiful as the flag; nothing more
                     beautiful than either for eyes to look upon.<pb n="18-19"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000015"/> And when Parson Spaulding had said the
                     benediction, and the Amen,—and when he had kissed Laura, with her eyes full of
                     tears,—and when he had given Tom Cutts joy,—then all the people came up in a
                     double line,—and they all kissed Laura,—and they shook hands with Tom as if
                     they would shake his hands off,—and in the half-reticent methods of Tripp's
                     Cove, every lord and lady bright that was in Moses Marvel's parlor there, said,
                     "honored be the bravest knight, beloved the fairest fair."</p>
                  <p>And there was a bunch of laurel hanging in the middle of the room, as
                     make-believe mistletoe. And the boys, who could not make believe even that they
                     were eighteen, so that they had been left at home, would catch Phebe, and
                     Sarah, and Mattie, and Helen, when by accident they crossed underneath the
                     laurel,—and would kiss them, for all their screaming. And soon Moses Marvel
                     brought in a waiter with wedding-cake, and Nathan Philbrick brought in a waiter
                     with bride-cake, and pretty Mattie Marvel brought in a waiter with currant
                     wine. And Tom Cutts gave every girl a piece of wedding-cake himself, and made
                     her promise to sleep on it. And before they were all gone, he and Laura had
                     been made to write names for the girls to dream upon, that they might draw
                     their fortunes the next morning. And before long Moses Cutts led Mrs. Spaulding
                     out into the great family-room, and there was the real wedding supper. And
                     after they had eaten the supper, Bengel's fiddle sounded in the parlor, and
                     they danced, and they waltzed, and they polked to their hearts' content. And so
                     they celebrated the Christmas of 1861.</p>
                  <p>Too bad! was not it? Tom's leave was only twenty days. It took five to come. It
                     took five to go. After the wedding there were but seven little days. And then
                     he kissed dear Laura good-by,—with tears running from his eyes and hers,—and
                     she begged him to be sure she should be all right, and he begged her to be
                     certain nothing would happen to him. And so, for near two years, they did not
                     see each other's faces again.</p>
                  <milestone n="———" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>CHRISTMAS EVE again!</p>
                  <p>Moses Marvel has driven out his own bays in his own double cutter to meet the
                     stage at Fordyce's. On the back seat is Mattie Marvel,<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000016"/> with a rosy little baby all wrapped up in furs,
                     who has never seen his father. Where is Laura?</p>
                  <p>"Here she comes! here she comes!" Sure enough! Here is the stage at last. Job
                     Stiles never swept round with a more knowing sweep, or better satisfied with
                     his precious freight at Fordyce's, than he did this afternoon. And the curtains
                     were up already. And there is Laura, and there is Tom! He is pale, poor fellow.
                     But how pleased he is! Laura is out first, of course. And then she gives him
                     her hand so gently, and the others all help. And here is the hero at Marvel's
                     side, and he is bending over his baby, whom he does not try to lift with his
                     one arm,—and Mattie is crying, and I believe old Moses Marvel is crying,—but
                     everybody is as happy as a king, and everybody is talking at one time,—and all
                     the combination has turned out well.</p>
                  <p>Tom Cutts had had a hole made through his left thigh, so that they despaired of
                     his life. And, as he lay on the ground, a bit of a shell had struck his left
                     forearm and knocked that to pieces. Tom Cutts had been sent back to hospital at
                     Washington, and reported by telegraph as mortally wounded. But almost as soon
                     as Tom Cutts got to the Lincoln Hospital himself, Laura Cutts got there too,
                     and then Tom did not mean to die if he could help it, and Laura did not mean to
                     have him. And the honest fellow held to his purpose in that steadfast Cutts
                     way. The blood tells, I believe. And love tells. And will tells. How much love
                     has to do with will! "I believe you are a witch, Mrs. Cutts," the doctor used
                     to say to her. "Nothing but good happens to this good-man of yours." Bits of
                     bone came out just as they were wanted to. Inflammation kept away just as it
                     was told to do. And the two wounds ran a race with each other in healing after
                     their fashion. "It will be a beautiful stump after all," said the doctor, where
                     poor Laura saw little beauty. But every thing was beautiful to her, when at
                     last he told her that she might wrap her husband up as well as she knew how,
                     and take him home and nurse him there. So she had telegraphed that they were
                     coming, and that was the way in which it happened that her father and her
                     sister had brought out the baby to meet them both at Fordyce's. Mattie's
                     surprise had worked perfectly.</p>
                  <p>And now it was time for Laura's surprise!<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000017"/> After she had her baby in her own arms, and was
                     on the back seat of the sleigh; after Tom was well wrapped up by her side, with
                     his well arm just supporting the little fellow's head; after Mattie was all
                     tucked in by her father, and Mr. Marvel himself had looked round to say, "All
                     ready?" then was it that Jem Marvel first stepped out from the stage, and said,
                     "Haven't you one word for me, Mattie?" Then how they screamed again! For
                     everybody thought Jem was in the West Indies. He was cruising there, on board
                     the "Greywing," looking after blockaders who took the Southern route. Nobody
                     dreamed of Jem's being at Christmas. And here he had stumbled on Tom and Laura
                     in the New Haven train as they came on! Jem had been sent into New York with a
                     prize. He had got leave, and was on his way to see the rest of them. He had
                     bidden Laura not say one word, and so he had watched one greeting from the
                     stage, before he broke in to take his part for another.</p>
                  <p>Oh! what an uproarious Christmas that was when they all came home! No! Tom
                     Cutts would not let one of them be sad! He was the cheeriest of them all. He
                     monopolized the baby, and showed immense power in the way of baby talk and of
                     tending. Laura had only to sit on the side of the room and be perfectly happy.
                     It was very soon known what the arrivals were. And Parson Spaulding came in,
                     and his wife. Of course the Cuttses had been there already. Then everybody
                     came. That is the simplest way of putting it. They all would have wanted to
                     come, because in that community there was not one person who did not love Laura
                     and Tom and Jem. But whether they would have come, on the very first night, I
                     am not sure. But this was Christmas Eve, and the girls were finishing off the
                     meeting-house just as the stage and the sleigh came in. And, in a minute, the
                     news was everywhere. And, of course, everybody felt he might just go in to get
                     news from the fleet or the army. Nor was there one household in Tripp's Cove
                     which was not more or less closely represented in the fleet or the army. So
                     there was really, as the evening passed, a town-meeting in Moses Marvel's
                     sitting-room and parlor; and whether Moses Marvel were most pleased, or Mrs.
                     Marvel, or Laura,—who sat and beamed,—or old General Simeon Cutts, I am sure I
                     do not know.</p>
                  <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6578-00000018"/>
                  <p>That was indeed a merry Christmas!</p>
                  <p>But after that I must own it was hard sledding for Tom Cutts and for pretty
                     Laura. A hero with one blue sleeve pinned neatly together, who, at the best,
                     limps as he walks, quickens all your compassion and gratitude;—yes! But when
                     you are selecting a director of your lumber works, or when you are sending to
                     New York to buy goods, or when you are driving a line of railway through the
                     wilderness, I am afraid you do not choose that hero to do your work for you. Or
                     if you do, you were not standing by when Tom Cutts was looking right and
                     looking left for something to do, so that he might keep the wolf from the door.
                     It was sadly like the life that his great-grandfather, Samuel Cutts, led at the
                     old farm in old Newbury after the old war. Tom lost his place when he went to
                     the front, and he could not find it again.</p>
                  <p>Laura, sweet girl, never complained. No, nor Moses Marvel. He never complained,
                     nor would he complain if Tom and his wife and children had lived with him till
                     doomsday. "Good luck for us," said Moses Marvel, and those were many words for
                     him to say in one sentence. But Tom was proud, and it ground him to the dust to
                     be eating Moses Marvel's bread when he had not earned it, and to have nothing
                     but his major's pension to buy Laura and the babies their clothes with, and to
                     keep the pot a-boiling.</p>
                  <p>Of course Jem joined the fleet again. Nor did Jem return again till the war was
                     over. Then he came, and came with prize-money. He and Tom had many talks of
                     going into business together, with Tom's brains and Jem's money. But nothing
                     came of this. The land was no place for Jem. He was a regular Norse man, as are
                     almost all of the Tripp's Cove boys who have come from the loins of the
                     "Fighting Twenty-seventh." They sniff the tempest from afar off; and when they
                     hear of Puget Sound, or of Alaska, or of Wilkes's Antarctic Continent, they
                     fancy that they hear a voice from some long-lost home, from which they have
                     strayed away. And so Laura knew, and Tom knew, that any plans which rested on
                     Jem's staying ashore were plans which had one false element in them. The raven
                     would be calling him, and it might be best, once for all, to let him follow the
                     raven till the raven called no more.</p>
                  <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6578-00000019"/>
                  <p>So Jem put his prize-money into a new bark, which he found building at Bath;
                     and they called the bark the "Laura," and Tom and Laura Cutts went to the
                     launching, and Jem superintended the rigging of her himself; and then he took
                     Tom and Laura and the babies with him to New York, and a high time they had
                     together there. Tom saw many of the old army boys, and Laura hunted up one or
                     two old school friends; and they saw Booth in Iago, and screamed themselves
                     hoarse at Niblo's, and heard Rudolphsen and Johannsen in the German opera; they
                     rode in the Park, and they walked in the Park; they browsed in the Astor and
                     went shopping at Stewart's, and saw the people paint porcelain at Haighwout's;
                     and, by Mr. Alden's kindness, went through the wonders of Harper's. In short,
                     for three weeks, all of which time they lived on board ship, they saw the lions
                     of New York as children of the public do, for whom that great city decks itself
                     and prepares its wonders, albeit their existence is hardly known to its
                     inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Jem had chartered the "Laura" for a voyage to San Francisco. And so,
                     before long, her cargo began to come on board; and she and Tom and the babies
                     took a mournful farewell, and came back to Tripp's Cove again, to Moses
                     Marvel's house. And poor Tom thought it looked smaller than ever, and that he
                     should find it harder than ever to settle down to being of no use to anybody,
                     and to eat Moses Marvel's bread,—without house or barn, or bin or oven, or
                     board or bed, even the meanest, of his own. Poor Tom! and this was the reward
                     of being the first man in Maine to enter for three years!</p>
                  <p>And then things went worse and worse. Moses Marvel was as good and as taciturn
                     as ever. But Moses Marvel's affairs did not run as smoothly as he liked. Moses
                     held on, upon one year's cutting of lumber, perfectly determined that lumber
                     should rise, because it ought to; and Moses paid very high usury on the money
                     he borrowed, because he would hold on. Moses was set in his way,—like other
                     persons whom you and I know,—and to this lumber he held and held, till finally
                     the bank would not renew his notes. No; and they would not discount a cent for
                     him at Bangor, and Moses came back from a long, taciturn journey he had started
                     on in search of money, without any<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6578-00000020"/>
                     money; and with only the certainty that if he did not mean to have the sheriff
                     sell his lumber, he must sell it for himself. Nay! he must sell it before the
                     fourth of the next month, and for cash; and must sell at the very bottom of a
                     long falling market! Poor Moses Marvel! That operation served to show that he
                     joined all the Cutts want of luck with the Marvel obstinacy. It was a wretched
                     twelvemonth, the whole of it; and it made that household, and made Tom Cutts,
                     more miserable and more.</p>
                  <p>Then they became anxious about the "Laura," and Jem. She made almost a clipper
                     voyage to California. She discharged her cargo in perfect order. Jem made a
                     capital charter for Australia and England, and knew that from England it would
                     be easy to get a voyage home. He sailed from California, and then the letters
                     stopped. No! Laura dear, no need in reading every word of the ship-news in the
                     "Semi-weekly Advertiser;" the name of your namesake is not there. Eight, nine,
                     ten months have gone by, and there is no port in Christendom which has seen.
                     Jem's face, or the Laura's private signal. Do not strain your eyes over the
                     "Semi-weekly" more.</p>
                  <p>No! dear Laura's eyes will be dimmed by other cares than the ship-news. Tom's
                     father, who had shared Tom's wretchedness, and would gladly have had them at
                     his home, but that Moses Marvel's was the larger and the less peopled of the
                     two,—Tom's father was brought home speechless one day, by the men who found him
                     where he had fallen on the road, his yoke of oxen not far away, waiting for the
                     voice which they were never to hear again. Whether he had fallen from the cart,
                     in some lurch it made, and broken his spine, or whether all this distress had
                     brought on of a sudden a stroke of paralysis, so that he lost his consciousness
                     before he fell, I do not know. Nor do I see that it matters much, though the
                     chimney-corners of Tripp's Cove discuss the question quite eagerly to this
                     hour. He lay there month after month, really unconscious. He smiled gently when
                     they brought him food. He tried to say "Thank you," they thought, but he did
                     not speak to the wife of his bosom, who had been the Laura Marvel of her day,
                     in any different way from that in which he tried to speak to any stranger of
                     them all. A living death he lay in as those tedious months went by.</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6578-00000021"/>
                  <p>Yet my dear Laura was as cheerful, and hopeful, and buoyant as ever. Tom Cutts
                     himself was ashamed to brood when he got a sight of her. Mother Cutts herself
                     would lie down and rest herself when Laura came round, with the two children,
                     as she did every afternoon. Moses Marvel himself was less taciturn when Laura
                     put the boys, one at one side, one at the other, of his chair, at the
                     tea-table. And in both of those broken households, from one end to the other,
                     they knew the magic of dear Laura's spells. So that when this Christmas came,
                     after poor Mr. Cutts had been lying senseless so long,—when dear Laura bade
                     them all take hold and fit up a Christmas-tree, with all the adornments, for
                     the little boys, and for the Spaulding children, and the Marvel cousins, and
                     the Hopkinses, and the Tredgolds, and the Newmarch children,—they all obeyed
                     her loyally, and without wondering. They obeyed her, with her own determination
                     that they would have one merry Christmas more. It seems a strange thing to
                     people who grew up outside of New England. But this was the first Christmas
                     tree ever seen at Tripp's Cove, for all such festivities are of recent
                     importation in such regions. But there was something for every child. They
                     heaped on more wood, and they kept a merry Christmas despite the storm without.
                     This was Laura's will, and Laura had her way.</p>
                  <p>And she had her reward. Job Stiles came round to the door, when he had put up
                     his horses, and called Tom out, and gave him a letter which he had brought from
                     Ellsworth. And Tom read the letter, and he called Laura to read it. And Laura
                     left the children, and sat at the kitchen table with him and read it, and said,
                     "Thank God! this is a Christmas present indeed. Could any thing in this world
                     be better?"</p>
                  <p>This is the letter:—</p>

                                 have done my best, and have failed. They say and I believe that the
                                 collectorship was promised to Waters before the old man's
                                 death,—that Waters had honest claims,—he has but one leg, you
                                 know,—and that it must go to him. As for the surveyorship, the gift
                                 of that is with Plumptre. And you know that I might<pb n="32-33"

                                 thing as he. And if he hates anybody more than me, why it is your
                                 wife's father. So I could do nothing there.</p>
                              <p>Let me say this, though it seems nothing. If, while we are waiting
                                 to look round, you like to take the Bell and Hammer Light-house,
                                 you may have the place to-morrow. Of course I know it is exile in
                                 winter. But in summer it is lovely. You have your house, your
                                 stores, two men under you (they are double lights), and a thousand
                                 dollars. I have made them promise to give it to no one till they
                                 hear from me. Though I know you ought not take any such place, I
                                 would not refuse it till I let you know. I send this to Ellsworth
                                 for the stage-driver to take, and you must send your answer by
                                 special messenger, that I may telegraph to Washington at once.</p>
                              <p>I am very sorry, dear Tom, to have failed you so. But I did my
                                 best, you know. Merry Christmas to Laura and the babies.</p>

                  <p>That was Laura and Tom's Christmas present. An appointment as light-house
                     keeper, with a thousand a year!</p>
                  <milestone n="———" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>BUT even if they had made Tom a turnpike keeper, they would not have made Laura
                     a misanthrope. He, poor fellow, gladly accepted the appointment. She, sweet
                     creature, as gladly accepted her part of it. Early March saw them on the Bell
                     and Hammer. April saw the early flowers come,—and May saw Laura with both her
                     babies on the beach, laughing at them as they wet their feet,—digging holes in
                     the sand for them,—and sending the bigger boy to run and put salt upon the
                     tails of the peeps as they ran along the shore. And Tom Cutts, when his glass
                     was clear to his mind, and the reflectors polished to meet even his criticism,
                     would come down and hunt up Laura and the children. And when she had put the
                     babies to sleep, old Mipples, who was another of the descendants of the
                     "Fighting Twenty-seventh," would say, "Just you go out with the Major, mum and
                     if they wake up and I can't still them, I'll blow the horn." Not that he ever
                     did blow the horn. All the more certain was<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000023"/> Laura that she could tramp over the whole island
                     with Tom Cutts, or she could sit and knit or sew, and Tom could read to her,
                     and these days were the happiest days of her married life, and brought back the
                     old sunny days of the times before Fort Sumter again. Ah me! if such days of
                     summer and such days of autumn would last forever!</p>
                  <p>But they will not last forever. November came, and the little colony went into
                     winter quarters. December came. And we were all double-banked with sea-weed.
                     The stoves were set up in-doors. The double doors were put on outside, and we
                     were all ready for the "Osprey." The "Osprey" was the Government steamer which
                     was to bring us our supplies for the winter, chiefly of colza oil,—and perhaps
                     some coal. But the "Osprey" does not appear. December is half gone, and no
                     "Osprey." We can put the stoves on short allowance, but not our two lanterns.
                     They will only run to the 31st of January, the nights are so long, if the
                     "Osprey" does not come before then.</p>
                  <p>That is our condition, when old Mipples, bringing back the mail, brings a
                     letter from Boston to say that the "Osprey" has broken her mainshaft shaft, and
                     may not be repaired before the 15th of January,—that Mr. Cutts, will therefore,
                     if he needs oil, take an early opportunity to supply himself from the light at
                     Squire's,—and that an order on the keeper at Squire's is enclosed.</p>
                  <p>To bring a cask of oil from Squire's is no difficult task to a Tripp's Cove
                     man. It would be no easy one, dear reader, to you and me. Squire's is on the
                     mainland,—our nearest neighbor at the Bell and Hammer,—it revolves once a
                     minute, and we watch it every night in the horizon. Tom waited day by day for a
                     fine day,—would not have gone for his oil indeed till the New Year came in, but
                     that Jotham Fields, the other assistant, came down with a fever turn wholly
                     beyond Laura's management, and she begged Tom to take the first fine day to
                     carry him to a doctor. To bring a doctor to him was out of the question.</p>
                  <p>"And what will you do?" said Tom.</p>
                  <p>"Do? I will wait till you come home. Start any fine day after you have wound up
                     the lights on the last beat,—take poor Jotham to his mother's house,—and if you
                     want you may bring back your oil. I shall get along with the<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000024"/> children very well,—and I will have your dinner
                     hot when you come home."</p>
                  <p>Tom doubted. But the next day Jotham was worse. Mipples voted for carrying him
                     ashore, and Laura had her way. The easier did she have it, because the south
                     wind blew softly, and it was clear to all men that the run could be made to
                     Squire's in a short two hours. Tom finally agreed to start early the next
                     morning. He would not leave his sick man at his mother's, but at Squire's, and
                     the people there could put him home. The weather was perfect, and an hour
                     before daylight they were gone. They were all gone,—all three had to go.
                     Mipples could not handle the boat alone, nor could Tom; far less could one of
                     them manage the boat, take the oil, and see to poor Jotham also. Wise or not,
                     this was the plan.</p>
                  <p>An hour before daylight they were gone. Half an hour after sunrise they were at
                     Squire's. But the sun had risen red, and had plumped into a cloud. Before
                     Jotham was carried up the cliff the wind was northwest, and the air was white
                     with snow. You could not see the house from the boat, nor the boat from the
                     house. You could not see the foremast of the boat from your seat in the
                     stern-sheets, the air was so white with snow. They carried Jotham up. But they
                     told John Wilkes, the keeper at Squire's, that they would come for the oil
                     another day. They hurried down the path to the boat again, pushed her off, and
                     headed her to the northeast determined not to lose a moment in beating back to
                     the Bell and Hammer. Who would have thought the wind would haul back so without
                     a sign of warning?</p>
                  <p>"Will it hold up, Simon?" said Tom to Mipples, wishing he might say something
                     encouraging.</p>
                  <p>And all Simon Mipples would say was,—</p>
                  <p>"God grant it may!"</p>
                  <milestone n="———" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>And Laura saw the sun rise red and burning. And Laura went up into the tower
                     next the house, and put out the light there. Then she left the children in
                     their cribs, and charged the little boy not to leave till she came back, and
                     ran down to the door to go and put out the other light,—and as she opened it
                     the blinding snow dashed in her face. She had not dreamed of snow before. But
                     her water-proof was on, she pulled on her boots, ran quickly along the<pb
                        n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6578-00000025"/> path to the other light, two hundred
                     yards perhaps, climbed the stairway and extinguished that, and was at home
                     again before the babies missed her.</p>
                  <p>For an hour or two Laura occupied herself with her household cares, and
                     pretended to herself that she thought this was only a snow flurry that would
                     soon clear away. But by the time it was ten o'clock she knew it was a stiff
                     north-wester, and that her husband and Mipples were caught on shore. Yes, and
                     she was caught with her babies alone on the island. Wind almost dead ahead to a
                     boat from Squire's too, if that made any difference. That crossed Laura's mind.
                     Still she would not brood. Nay, she did not brood, which was much better than
                     saying she would not brood. It crossed her mind that it was the day before
                     Christmas, and that the girls at Tripp's were dressing the meeting-house for
                     dear old Parson Spaulding. And then there crossed her mind the dear old man's
                     speech at all weddings, "As you climb the hill of life together, my dear young
                     friends," and poor Laura, as she kissed the baby once again, had courage to
                     repeat it all aloud to her and her brother, to the infinite amazement of them
                     both. They opened their great eyes to the widest as Laura did so. Nay, Laura
                     had the heart to take a hatchet, and work out to leeward of the house, into a
                     little hollow behind the hill, and cut up a savin bush from the thicket, and
                     bring that in, and work for an hour over the leaves so as to make an evergreen
                     frame to hang about General Cutts's picture. She did this that Tom might see
                     she was not frightened when he got home.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>When</emph> he got home! Poor girl! at the very bottom of her heart was
                     the other and real anxiety,—<emph>if</emph> he got home. Laura knew Tom, of
                     course, better than he knew himself, and she knew old Mipples too. So she knew,
                     as well as she knew that she was rubbing black lead on the stove, while she
                     thought these things over,—she knew that they would not stay at Squire's two
                     minutes after they had landed Jotham Fields. She knew they would do just what
                     they did,—put to sea, though it blew guns, though now the surf was running its
                     worst on the Seal's Back. She knew, too, that if they had not missed the
                     island, they would have been here, at the latest, before eleven o'clock. And by
                     the time it was one she could no longer doubt that they had lost the island,
                     and were tacking about looking for it in the bay, if, indeed, in<pb
                        n="39.1-39.2" xml:id="VAC6578-00000026"/> that gale they dared to tack at
                     all. No! Laura knew only too well, that where they were was beyond her
                     guessing; that the good God and they two only knew.</p>
                  <p>"Come here, Tom, and let me tell you a story! Once there was a little boy, and
                     he had two kittens. And he named one kitten Muff, and he named one kitten
                     Buff!"—</p>
                  <p>Whang!</p>
                  <p>What was that?</p>
                  <p>"Tom, darling, take care of baby; do not let her get out of the cradle, while
                     mamma goes to the door." Downstairs to the door. The gale has doubled its rage.
                     How ever did it get in behind the storm-door outside? That "<emph>whang</emph>"
                     was the blow with which the door, wrenched off its hinges, was flung against
                     the side of the wood-house. Nothing can be done but to bolt the storm-door to
                     the other passage, and bolt the outer window shutters, and then go back to the
                     children.</p>
                  <p>"Once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens, and he named one Minna,
                     and one Brenda"—</p>
                  <p>"No, mamma, no! one Muff, and one"—</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! my darling! once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens, and
                     he named one Buff, and one Muff. And one day he went to walk"—</p>
                  <p>Heavens! the lanterns! Who was to trim the lamps? Strange to say, because this
                     was wholly out of her daily routine, the men always caring for it of course,
                     Laura had not once thought of it till now. And now it was after one o'clock.
                     But now she did think of it with a will. "Come, Tommy, come and help mamma."
                     And she bundled him up in his thickest storm rig. "Come up into the lantern."
                     Here the boy had never come before. He was never frightened when he was with
                     her. Else he might well have been frightened. And he was amazed there in the
                     whiteness; drifts of white snow on the lee-side and the weather-side; clouds of
                     white snow on the south-west sides and north-east sides; snow; snow everywhere;
                     nothing but whiteness wherever he looked round.</p>
                  <p>Laura made short shift of those wicks which had burned all through the night
                     before. But she had them ready. She wound up the carcels for their night's
                     work. Again and again she drew her oil and filled up her reservoirs. And as she
                     did so, an old text came on her, and she wondered whether Father Spaulding knew
                        how<pb n="39.3-39.4" xml:id="VAC6578-00000027"/> good a text it would be for
                     Christmas. And the fancy touched her, poor child, and as she led little Tom
                     down into the nursery again, she could not help opening into the Bible Parson
                     Spaulding gave her and reading:—</p>
                  <p>"'But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom
                     tarried, they all slumbered and slept.' Dear Tommy, dear Tommy, my own child,
                     we will not sleep, will we? 'While the bridegroom tarried,' O my dear Father in
                     Heaven, let him come. 'And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
                     bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him;'" and she devoured little Tommy with
                     kisses, and cried, "We will go, my darling, we will go, if he comes at the
                     first hour,—or the second,—or the third! But now Tommy must come with mamma,
                     and make ready for his coming." For there were the other lamps to trim in the
                     other tower, with that heavy reach of snow between. And she did not dare leave
                     the active boy alone in the house. Little Matty could be caged in her crib,
                     and, even if she woke, she would at best only cry. But Tom was
                     irrepressible.</p>
                  <p>So they unbolted the lee-door, and worked out into the snow. Then poor Laura,
                     with the child, crept round into the storm. Heavens! how it raged and howled!
                     Where was her poor bridegroom now? She seized up Tom, and turned her back to
                     the wind, and worked along, sideway, sideway, the only way she could go,—step
                     by step,—did it ever seem so far before? Tommy was crying. "One minute more,
                     dear boy. Tommy shall see the other lantern. And Tommy shall carry mamma's
                     great scissors up the stairs. Don't cry, my darling, don't cry."</p>
                  <p>Here is the door;—just as she began to wonder if she were dreaming or crazy.
                     Not so badly drifted in as she feared. At least she is under cover. "Up-a-day,
                     my darling, up-a-day. One, two, what a many steps for Tommy! That's my brave
                     boy." And they were on the lantern deck again, fairly rocking in the gale,—and
                     Laura was chopping away on her stiff wicks, and pumping up her oil again, and
                     filling the receivers, as if she had ever done it till this Christmas before.
                     And she kept saying over to herself,—</p>
                  <p>"Then those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps."</p>
                  <p>"And I will light them," said she aloud. "That will save another walk at
                     sundown. And I know these carcels run at least five hours." So she struck a
                     match, and with some<pb n="39.5-39.6" xml:id="VAC6578-00000028"/> little
                     difficulty coaxed the fibres to take fire. The yellow light flared luridly on
                     the white snow-flakes, and yet it dazzled her and Tommy as it flashed on them
                     from the reflectors. "Will anybody see it, mamma?" said the child. "Will papa
                     see it?" And just then the witching devil who manages the fibres of memory,
                     drew from the little crypt in Laura's brain, where they had been stored
                     unnoticed years upon years, four lines of Leigh Hunt's, and the child saw that
                     she was Hero:— <q>

                  <p>If only the devil would have been satisfied with this. But of course she could

                     Tom gave her the book himself; and this was his own version, as he sent it to

                  <p>"What a fool I am! Come, Tommy. Come, Matty, my darling. Mamma will tell you a
                     story. Once there was a little boy, and he had two kittens. And he named one
                     Buff and one Muff"—But this could not last for ever. Sundown came. And then
                     Laura and Tommy climbed their own tower,—and she lighted her own lantern, as
                     she called it. Sickly and sad through the storm, she could see the sister
                     lantern burning bravely. And that was all she could see in the sullen
                     whiteness. "Now, Tommy, my darling, we will come and have some supper." "And
                     while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept." "Yes, 'tis he;
                     although he perished, still his sacred troth he cherished." "Come, Tommy,—come
                     Tommy,—come, Tommy, let me tell you a story."</p>
                  <p>But the children had their supper,—asking<pb n="39.7-39.8"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000029"/> terrible questions about papa,—questions which
                     who should answer? But she could busy herself about giving them their oatmeal,
                     and treating them to ginger-snaps, because it was Christmas Eve. Nay, she kept
                     her courage, when Tommy asked if Santa Claus would come in the boat with papa.
                     She fairly loitered over the undressing them. Little witches, how pretty they
                     were in their flannel nightgowns! And Tommy kissed her, and gave her—ah me!—one
                     more kiss for papa. And in two minutes they were asleep. It would have been
                     better if they could have kept awake one minute longer. Now she was really
                     alone. And very soon seven o'clock has come. She does not dare leave the
                     clock-work at the outer lantern a minute longer. Tom and Mipples wind the works
                     every four hours, and now they have run five. One more look at her darlings.
                     Shall she ever see them again in this world? Now to the duty next her hand!</p>
                  <p>Yes, the wind is as fierce as ever! A point more to the north, Laura notices.
                     She has no child to carry now. She tumbles once in the drift. But Laura has
                     rolled in snow before. The pile at the door is three feet thick. But she works
                     down to the latch,—and even her poor numb hand conquers it,—and it gives way.
                     How nice and warm the tower is! and how well the lights burn! Can they be of
                     any use this night to anybody? O my God, grant that they be of use to him!</p>
                  <p>She has wound them now. She has floundered into the snow again. Two or three
                     falls on her way home,—but no danger that she loses the line of march. The
                     light above her own house is before her. So she has only to aim at that. Home
                     again! And now to wait for five hours,—and then to wind that light again—at
                     midnight!</p>
                  <p>"And at midnight there was a cry made"—"oh dear!—if he would come,—I would not
                     ask for any cry!"—</p>
                  <p>And Laura got down her choice inlaid box, that Jem brought her from sea,—and
                     which held her treasures of treasures. And the dear girl did the best thing she
                     could have done. She took these treasures out.—You know what they were, do not
                     you? They were every letter Tom Cutts ever wrote her—from the first boy note in
                     print,—"Laura,—these hedgehog quills are for you. I killed him. TOM." And Laura
                     opened them all,—and read them one by one,<pb n="39.9-39.10"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000030"/> each twice,—and put them back, in their order,
                     without folding, into the box. At ten she stopped,—and worked her way upstairs
                     into her own lantern,—and wound its works again. She tried to persuade herself
                     that there was less wind,—did persuade herself so. But the snow was as steady
                     as ever. Down the tower-stairs again,—and then a few blessed minutes brooding
                     over Matty's crib, and dear little Tom who has kicked himself right athwart her
                     own bed where she had laid him. Darlings! they are so lovely, their father must
                     come home to see them! Back then to her kitchen fire. There are more of dear
                     Tom's letters yet. How manly they are,—and how womanly. She will read them
                     all!—will she ever dare to read them all again?</p>
                  <p>Yes,—she reads them all,—each one twice over,—and his soldier diary,—which John
                     Wildair saved and sent home, and, as she lays it down, the clock strikes
                     twelve. Christmas day is born!—</p>
                  <p>"And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh." Laura
                     fairly repeated this aloud. She knew that the other carcel must be wound again.
                     She dressed herself for the fight thoroughly. She ran in and trusted herself to
                     kiss the children. She opened the lee-door again, and crept round again into
                     the storm,—familiar now with such adventure. Did the surf beat as fiercely on
                     the rocks? Surely not. But then the tide is now so low! So she came to her
                     other tower, crept up and wound her clock-work up again, wiped off, or tried to
                     wipe off, what she thought was mist gathering on the glasses, groped down the
                     stairway, and looked up on the steady light above her own home. And the
                     Christmas text came back to her. "The star went before them, and stood above
                     the place where the young child was."</p>
                  <p>"A light to lighten the Gentiles,—and the glory of my people Israel!"</p>
                  <p>"By the way of the sea,"—and this Laura almost shouted aloud,—"Galilee of the
                     Gentiles, the people who sat in darkness saw a great light, and to them who sat
                     in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up." "Grant it, merciful
                     Father,—grant it for these poor children!" And she almost ran through the heavy
                     drifts, till she found the shelter again of her friendly tower. Her darlings
                     had not turned in their bed, since she left them there.</p>
                  <p>And after this Laura was at rest. She took<pb n="39.11-39.12"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000031"/> down her Bible, and read the Christmas chapters.
                     It was as if she had never known before what darkness was,—or what the Light
                     was, when it came. She took her Hymn Book and read all the Christmas Hymns. She
                     took her Keble,—and read every poem for Advent and the hymn for Christmas
                     morning. She knew this by heart long ago. Then she took Bishop Ken's "Christian
                     Year,"—which Tom had given for her last birthday present,—and set herself
                     bravely to committing his "Christmas Day" to memory:— <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> and thus, dear girl, she kept herself from thinking even of the wretched
                     Hero and Leander lines, till her clock struck three. Upstairs then to her own
                     tower, and to look out upon the night. The sister flame was steady. The wind
                     was all hushed. But the snow was as steady, right and left, behind and before.
                     Down again, one more look at the darlings, and then, as she walked up and down
                     her little kitchen, she repeated the verses she had learned, and then sat down to—<q>

                     the boat's lantern before him as he steals into her kitchen, crosses the room,
                     and looks down on her,—what a shame to wake her,—bends down and kisses

                  <p>"Have I been asleep on duty?" This was her first word when she came fairly to

                  <p>"Guess not," said old Mipples, "both lanterns was burning when I come in. 'Most

                  <p>"Is the north light burning?" said poor Laura. And she looked guiltily at her
                     tell-tale clock.</p>
                  <p>"Darling," said Tom, reverently, "if it were not burning, we should not be
                     here."</p>
                  <p>And Laura took her husband to see the babies, not willing to let his hand leave
                     hers, nor he, indeed, to let hers leave his. Old Mipples thought himself one
                     too many, and went away, wiping his eyes, to the other light. "Time to
                     extinguish it," he said.</p>
                  <p>But before Tom and Laura had known he was gone, say in half an hour, that is,
                     he was back again, hailing them from below.</p>
                  <p>"Major! Major! Major! An English steamer is at anchor in the cove, and is
                     sending her boat ashore."</p>
                  <p>Tom and Laura rushed to the window; the snow was all over now, and they could
                     see the monster lying within half a mile. "Where would they be, Miss Cutts, if
                     somebody had not wound up the lamps at midnight? Guess they said 'Merry
                     Christmas' when they see 'em." And Laura held her breath when she thought what
                     might have been. Tom and Mipples ran down to the beach to hail them, and direct
                     the landing. Tom and Mipples shook the hand of each man as he came ashore, and
                     then Laura could see them hurrying to the house together. Steps on the landing;
                     steps on the stairway,—the door is open, and,—not Tom this time,—but her dear
                     lost brother Jem, in the flesh, and in a heavy pea-coat.</p>

                  <p>I ALWAYS give myself a Christmas present. And on this particular year the
                     present was a Carol party,—which is about as good fun, all things consenting
                     kindly, as a man can have.</p>
                  <p>Many things must consent, as will appear. First of all there must be good
                     sleighing,—and second, a fine night for Christmas eve. Ours are not the
                     carollings of your poor shivering little East Angles or South Mercians, where
                     they have to plod round afoot in countries where they do not know what a
                     sleigh-ride is.</p>
                  <p>I had asked Harry to have sixteen of the best voices in the chapel school to be
                     trained to eight or ten good Carols without knowing why. We did not care to
                     disappoint them if a February thaw setting in on the 24th of December should
                     break up the spree before it began. Then I had told Howland that he must
                     reserve for me a span of good horses, and a sleigh that I could pack sixteen
                     small children into, tight-stowed. Howland is always good about such things,
                     knew what the sleigh was for, having done the same in other years, and doubled
                     the span of horses of his own accord, because the children would like it
                     better, and "it would be no difference to him." Sunday night as the weather
                     nymphs ordered, the wind hauled round to the northwest and everything froze
                     hard. Monday night, things moderated and the snow began to fall steadily,—so
                     steadily;—and so Tuesday night the Metropolitan people gave up their unequal
                     contest, all good men and angels rejoicing at their discomfiture, and only a
                     few of the people in the very lowest <foreign>Bolgie,</foreign> being
                     ill-natured enough to grieve. And thus it was, that by Thursday evening was one
                     hard compact roadway from Copp's Hill to the Bone-burner's Gehenna, fit for
                     good men and angels to ride over, without jar, without noise and without
                     fatigue to horse or man. So it was that when I came down with Lycidas to the
                     chapel at seven o'clock, I found Harry had gathered there his eight pretty
                     girls and his<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6578-00000034"/> eight jolly boys, and
                     had them practising for the last time, <q>

                           <l>"Carol, carol, Christians,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>I think the children had got inkling of what was coming, or perhaps Harry had
                     hinted it to their mothers. Certainly they were warmly dressed, and when,
                     fifteen minutes afterwards, Howland came round himself with the sleigh, he had
                     put in as many rugs and bear-skins as if he thought the children were to be
                     taken new born from their respective cradles. Great was the rejoicing as the
                     bells of the horses rang beneath the chapel windows, and Harry did not get his
                     last <foreign xml:lang="ITA">da capo</foreign> for his last carol. Not much
                     matter indeed, for they were perfect enough in it before midnight.</p>
                  <p>Lycidas and I tumbled in on the back seat, each with a child in his lap to keep
                     us warm; I was flanked by Sam Perry, and he by John Rich, both of the mercurial
                     age, and therefore good to do errands. Harry was in front somewhere flanked in
                     likewise, and the twelve other children lay in miscellaneously between, like
                     sardines when you have first opened the box. I had invited Lycidas, because,
                     besides being my best friend, he is the best fellow in the world, and so
                     deserves the best Christmas eve can give him. Under the full moon, on the snow
                     still white, with sixteen children at the happiest, and with the blessed
                     memories of the best the world has ever had, there can be nothing better than
                     two or three such hours.</p>
                  <p>"First, driver, out on Commonwealth Avenue. That will tone down the horses.
                     Stop on the left after you have passed Fairfield Street." So we dashed up to
                     the front of Haliburton's palace, where he was keeping his first Christmas
                     tide. And the children, whom Harry had hushed down for a square or two, broke
                     forth with good full voice under his strong lead in <q>
                        <l>"Shepherd of tender sheep,"</l>
                     </q> singing with all that unconscious pathos with which children do sing, and
                     starting the tears in your eyes in the midst of your gladness. The instant the
                     horses' bells stopped, their voices began. In an instant more we saw Haliburton
                     and Anna run to the window and<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6578-00000035"/> pull up
                     the shades, and, in a minute more, faces at all the windows. And so the
                     children sung through Clement's old hymn. Little did Clement think of bells and
                     snow, as he taught it in his Sunday school there in Alexandria. But perhaps
                     to-day, as they pin up the laurels and the palm in the chapel at Alexandria,
                     they are humming the words, not thinking of Clement more than he thought of us.

                     the sleigh into a bank on the slope of Pinckney Street in front of Walter's

                     Ephrem the Syrian, if they did but know it! And when, after this, Harry would
                     fain have driven on, because two carols at one house was the rule, how the
                     little witches begged that they might sing just one song more there, because
                     Mrs. Alexander had been so kind to them, when she showed them about the German
                     stitches. And then up the hill and over to the<pb n="46-47"

                     up into Moon Court, that they might sing to the Italian image-man who gave Lucy
                     the boy and dog in plaster, when she was sick in the spring. For the children
                     had, you know, the choice of where they would go; and they select their best
                     friends, and will be more apt to remember the Italian image-man than Chrysostom
                     himself, though Chrysostom should have "made a few remarks" to them seventeen
                     times in the chapel. Then the Italian image-man heard for the first time in his

                  <p>And then we came up Hanover Street and stopped under Mr. Gerry's chapel, where

                     from his more serious views, and the Daily the next morning wished everybody a
                     merry Christmas with even more unction, and resolved that in coming years it
                     would have a supplement, large enough to contain all the good wishes. So away
                     again to the houses of confectioners who had given the children candy,—to Miss
                     Simonds's house, because she had been so good to them in school,—to the palaces
                     of millionnaires who had prayed for these children with tears if the children
                     only knew it,—to Dr. Frothingham's in Summer Street, I remember, where we
                     stopped because the Boston Association of Ministers met there,—and out on Dover
                     Street Bridge, that the poor chair-mender might hear our carols sung once more
                     before he heard them better sung in another world where nothing needs

                     hush directly as the horses' bells were stilled, thrown into the air with all
                     the gladness of childhood, selected sometimes as Harry happened to think best
                     for the hearers, but more often as the jubilant and uncontrolled enthusiasm of
                     the children bade them break out in the most joyous, least studied, and purely
                     lyrical of all. O, we went to twenty places that night, I suppose! We went to
                     the grandest places in Boston, and we went to the meanest. Everywhere they
                     wished us a merry Christmas, and we them. Everywhere a little crowd gathered
                     round us, and then we dashed away far enough to gather quite another crowd; and
                     then back, perhaps, not sorry to double on our steps if need were, and leaving
                     every crowd with a happy thought of <q>
                        <l>'The star, the manger, and the Child!"</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At nine we brought up at my house, D Street, three doors from the corner, and
                     the children picked their very best for Polly and my six little girls to hear,
                     and then for the first time we let them jump out and run in. Polly had some hot
                     oysters for them, so that the frolic was crowned with a treat. There was a
                     Christmas cake cut into sixteen pieces, which they took home to dream upon; and
                     then hoods and muffs on again, and by ten o'clock, or a little after, we had
                     all the girls and all the little ones at their homes. Four of the big boys, our
                     two flankers and Harry's right and left hand men, begged that they might stay
                     till the last moment. They could walk back from the stable, and "rather walk
                     than not, indeed." To which we assented, having gained parental permission, as
                     we left younger sisters in their respective homes.</p>

                  <p>Lycidas and I both thought, as we went into these modest houses, to leave the
                     children, to say they had been good and to wish a "Merry Christmas" ourselves
                     to fathers, mothers, and to guardian aunts, that the welcome of those homes was
                     perhaps the best part of it all.<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6578-00000038"/> Here
                     was the great stout sailor-boy whom we had not seen since he came back from
                     sea. He was a mere child when he left our school years on years ago, for the
                     East, on board Perry's vessel, and had been round the world. Here was brave
                     Mrs. Masury. I had not seen her since her mother died. "Indeed, Mr. Ingham, I
                     got so used to watching then, that I cannot sleep well yet o' nights; I wish
                     you knew some poor creature that wanted me to-night, if it were only in memory
                     of Bethlehem." "You take a deal of trouble for the children," said Campbell, as
                     he crushed my hand in his; "but you know they love you, and you know I would do
                     as much for you and yours,"—which I knew was true. "What can I send to your
                     children?" said Dalton, who was finishing sword-blades. (Ill wind was Fort
                     Sumter, but it blew good to poor Dalton, whom it set up in the world with his
                     sword-factory.) "Here's an old-fashioned tape-measure for the girl, and a
                     Sheffield wimble for the boy. What, there is no boy? Let one of the girls have
                     it then; it will count one more present for her." And so he pressed his
                     brown-paper parcel into my hand. From every house, though it were the humblest,
                     a word of love, as sweet, in truth, as if we could have heard the voice of
                     angels singing in the sky.</p>
                  <p>I bade Harry good-night; took Lycidas to his lodgings, and gave his wife my
                     Christmas wishes and good-night; and, coming down to the sleigh again, gave way
                     to the feeling which I think you will all understand, that this was not the
                     time to stop, but just the time to begin. For the streets were stiller now, and
                     the moon brighter than ever, if possible, and the blessings of these simple
                     people and of the grand people, and of the very angels in heaven, who are not
                     bound to the misery of using words when they have anything worth saying,—all
                     these wishes and blessings were round me, all the purity of the still winter
                     night, and I didn't want to lose it all by going to bed to sleep. So I put the
                     boys all together, where they could chatter, took one more brisk turn on the
                     two avenues, and then, passing through Charles Street, I believe I was even
                     thinking of Cambridge, I noticed the lights in Woodhull's house, and, seeing
                     they were up, thought I would make Fanny a midnight call. She came to the door
                     herself. I asked if she were waiting for Santa<pb n="52-53"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000039"/> Claus, but saw in a moment that I must not joke
                     with her. She said she had hoped I was her husband. In a minute was one of
                     these contrasts which make life, life. God puts us into the world that we may
                     try them and be tried by them. Poor Fanny's mother had been blocked up on the
                     Springfield train as she was coming on to Christmas. The old lady had been
                     chilled through, and was here in bed now with pneumonia. Both Fanny's children
                     had been ailing when she came, and this morning the doctor had pronounced it
                     scarlet fever. Fanny had not undressed herself since Monday, nor slept, I
                     thought, in the same time. So while we had been singing carols and wishing
                     merry Christmas, the poor child had been waiting, and hoping that her husband
                     or Edward, both of whom were on the tramp, would find for her and bring to her
                     the model nurse, who had not yet appeared. But at midnight this unknown sister
                     had not arrived, nor had either of the men returned. When I rang, Fanny had
                     hoped I was one of them. Professional paragons, dear reader, are shy of scarlet
                     fever. I told the poor child that it was better as it was. I wrote a line for
                     Sam Perry to take to his aunt, Mrs. Masury, in which I simply said: "Dear
                     mamma, I have found the poor creature who wants you to-night. Come back in this
                     carriage." I bade him take a hack at Barnard's, where they were all up waiting
                     for the assembly to be done at Papanti's. I sent him over to Albany Street; and
                     really as I sat there trying to soothe Fanny, it seemed to me less time than it
                     has taken me to dictate this little story about her, before Mrs. Masury rang
                     gently, and I left them, having made Fanny promise that she would consecrate
                     the day, which at that moment was born, by trusting God, by going to bed and
                     going to sleep, knowing that her children were in much better hands than hers.
                     As I passed out of the hall, the gas-light fell on a print of Correggio's
                     Adoration, where Woodhull had himself written years before, <q>
                        <l>"Ut appareat iis qui in tenebris et umbra mortis positi sunt."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Darkness and the shadow of death" indeed, and what light like the light and
                     comfort such a woman as my Mary Masury brings!</p>
                  <p>And so, but for one of the accidents, as we call them, I should have dropped
                     the boys at<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6578-00000040"/> the corner of Dover
                     Street, and gone home with my Christmas lesson.</p>
                  <p>But it happened, as we irreverently say,—it happened as we crossed Park Square,
                     so called from its being an irregular pentagon of which one of the sides has
                     been taken away, that I recognized a tall man, plodding across in the snow,
                     head down, round-shouldered, stooping forward in walking, with his right
                     shoulder higher than his left; and by these tokens I knew Tom Coram, prince
                     among Boston princes. Not Thomas Coram that built the Foundling Hospital,
                     though he was of Boston too; but he was longer ago. You must look for him in
                     Addison's contribution to a supplement to the Spectator,—the old Spectator, I
                     mean, not the Thursday Spectator, which is more recent. Not Thomas Coram, I
                     say, but Tom Coram, who would build a hospital to-morrow, if you showed him the
                     need, without waiting to die first, and always helps forward, as a prince
                     should, whatever is princely, be it a statue at home, a school at Richmond, a
                     newspaper in Florida, a church in Exeter, a steam-line to Liverpool, or a widow
                     who wants a hundred dollars. I wished him a merry Christmas, and Mr. Howland,
                     by a fine instinct, drew up the horses as I spoke. Coram shook hands; and, as
                     it seldom happens that I have an empty carriage while he is on foot, I asked
                     him if I might not see him home. He was glad to get in. We wrapped him up with
                     spoils of the bear, the fox, and the bison, turned the horses' heads
                     again,—five hours now since they started on this entangled errand of
                     theirs,—and gave him his ride. "I was thinking of you at the moment," said
                     Coram,—"thinking of old college times, of the mystery of language as unfolded
                     by the Abbé Faria to Edmond Dantes in the depths of the Chateau d'If. I was
                     wondering if you could teach me Japanese, if I asked you to a Christmas
                     dinner." I laughed. Japan was really a novelty then, and I asked him since when
                     he had been in correspondence with the sealed country. It seemed that their
                     house at Shanghae had just sent across there their agents for establishing the
                     first house in Edomo, in Japan, under the new treaty. Everything looked
                     promising, and the beginnings were made for the branch which has since become
                     Dot and Trevilyan there. Of this he had the first tidings in his letters by the
                     mail of that<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6578-00000041"/> afternoon. John Coram,
                     his brother, had written to him, and had said that he enclosed for his
                     amusement the Japanese bill of particulars, as it had been drawn out, on which
                     they had founded their orders for the first assorted cargo ever to be sent from
                     America to Edomo. Bill of particulars there was, stretching down the long
                     tissue-paper in exquisite chirography. But by some freak of the "total
                     depravity of things," the translated order for the assorted cargo was not
                     there. John Coram, in his care to fold up the Japanese writing nicely, had left
                     on his own desk at Shanghae the more intelligible English. "And so I must
                     wait," said Tom philosophically, "till the next East India mail for my orders,
                     certain that seven English houses have had less enthusiastic and philological
                     correspondents than my brother."</p>
                  <p>I said I did not see that. That I could not teach him to speak the Taghalian
                     dialects so well, that he could read them with facility before Saturday. But I
                     could do a good deal better. Did he remember writing a note to old Jack
                     Percival for me five years ago? No, he remembered no such thing; he knew Jack
                     Percival, but never wrote a note to him in his life. Did he remember giving me
                     fifty dollars, because I had taken a delicate boy, whom I was going to send to
                     sea, and I was not quite satisfied with the government outfit? No, he did not
                     remember that, which was not strange, for that was a thing he was doing every
                     day. "Well, I don't care how much you remember, but the boy about whom you
                     wrote to Jack Percival, for whose mother's ease of mind you provided the
                     half-hundred, is back again,—strong, straight, and well; what is more to the
                     point, he had the whole charge of Perry's commissariat on shore at Yokohama,
                     was honorably discharged out there, reads Japanese better than you read
                     English; and if it will help you at all, he shall be here at your house at
                     breakfast." For as I spoke we stopped at Coram's door. "Ingham," said Coram,
                     "if you were not a parson, I should say you were romancing." "My child," said
                     I, "I sometimes write a parable for the Atlantic; but the words of my lips are
                     verity, as all those of the Sandemanians. Go to bed; do not even dream of the
                     Taghalian dialects; be sure that the Japanese interpreter will breakfast with
                     you, and the next time you are in a scrape send for the nearest minister.
                     George, tell your<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6578-00000042"/> brother Ezra that
                     Mr. Coram wishes him to breakfast here to-morrow morning at eight o'clock;
                     don't forget the number, Pemberton Square, you know." "Yes, sir," said George;
                     and Thomas Coram laughed, said "Merry Christmas," and we parted.</p>
                  <p>It was time we were all in bed, especially these boys. But glad enough am I as
                     I write these words that the meeting of Coram set us back that dropped-stitch
                     in our night's journey. There was one more delay. We were sweeping by the Old
                     State House, the boys singing again, "Carol, carol, Christians," as we dashed
                     along the still streets, when I caught sight of Adams Todd, and he recognized
                     me. He had heard us singing when we were at the Advertiser office. Todd is an
                     old fellow-apprentice of mine,—and he is now, or rather was that night, chief
                     pressman in the Argus office. I like the Argus people,—it was there that I was
                     South American Editor, now many years ago,—and they befriend me to this hour.
                     Todd hailed me, and once more I stopped. "What sent you out from your warm
                     steam-boiler?" "Steam-boiler, indeed," said Todd. "Two rivets loose,—steam-room
                     full of steam,—police frightened, —neighborhood in a row,—and we had to put out
                     the fire. She would have run a week without hurting a fly,—only a little puff
                     in the street sometimes. But there we are, Ingham. We shall lose the early mail
                     as it stands. Seventy-eight tokens to be worked now." They always talked
                     largely of their edition at the Argus. Saw it with many eyes, perhaps; but this
                     time, I am sure, Todd spoke true. I caught his idea at once. In younger and
                     more muscular times, Todd and I had worked the Adams press by that fly-wheel
                     for full five minutes at a time, as a test of strength; and in my mind's eye, I
                     saw that he was printing his paper at this moment with relays of grinding
                     stevedores. He said it was so. "But think of it to-night," said he. "It is
                     Christmas eve, and not an Irishman to be hired, though one paid him ingots. Not
                     a man can stand the grind ten minutes." I knew that very well from old
                     experience, and I thanked him inwardly for not saying "the demnition grind,"
                     with Mantilini. "We cannot run the press half the time," said he; "and the men
                     we have are giving out now. We shall lose all our carrier delivery." "Todd,"
                     said I, "is this a night to<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6578-00000043"/> be talking
                     of ingots, or hiring, or losing, or gaining? When will you learn that Love
                     rules the court, the camp, and the Argus office. And I wrote on the back of a
                     letter to Campbell: "Come to the Argus office, No. 2 Dassett's Alley, with
                     seven men not afraid to work"; and I gave it to John and Sam, bade Howland take
                     the boys to Campbell's house,—walked down with Todd to his office,—challenged
                     him to take five minutes at the wheel, in memory of old times,—made the tired
                     relays laugh as they saw us take hold; and then,—when I had cooled off, and put
                     on my Cardigan,—met Campbell, with his seven sons of Anak, tumbling down the
                     stairs, wondering what round of mercy the parson had found for them this time.
                     I started home, knowing I should now have my Argus with my coffee.</p>

                     making a night of it! Well, there are few hours of the day or night when I have
                     not been in Lycidas's room, so I let myself in by the night-key he gave me, ran
                     up the stairs,—it is a horrid seven-storied, first-class lodging-house. For my
                     part, I had as lief live in a steeple. Two flights I ran up, two steps at a
                     time,—I was younger then than I am now,—pushed open the door which was ajar,
                     and saw such a scene of confusion as I never saw in Mary's over-nice parlor
                     before. Queer! I remember the first thing that I saw was wrong was a great ball
                     of white German worsted on the floor. Her basket was upset. A great
                     Christmas-tree lay across the rug, quite too high for the room; a large
                     sharp-pointed Spanish clasp-knife was by it, with which they had been lopping
                     it; there were two immense baskets of white papered presents, both upset; but
                     what frightened me most was the centre-table. Three or four handkerchiefs on
                     it,—towels, napkins, I know not what,—all brown and red and almost black with
                     blood! I turned, heart-sick, to look into the bedroom,—and I really had a sense
                     of relief when I saw somebody. Bad enough it was, however. Lycidas, but just
                     now so strong and well, lay pale and exhausted on the bloody bed, with the
                     clothing removed from his right thigh and leg, while over him bent Mary and
                     Morton. I learned afterwards that poor Lycidas, while trimming the
                     Christmas-tree, and talking merrily with Mary and Morton,—who, by good luck,
                     had brought round his presents late, and was staying to tie on glass balls and
                     apples,—had given himself a deep and dangerous wound with the point of the
                     unlucky knife, and had lost a great deal of blood before the hemorrhage could
                     be controlled. Just before I entered, the stick tourniquet which<pb n="64-65"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000045"/> Morton had improvised had slipped in poor Mary's
                     unpractised hand, at the moment he was about to secure the bleeding artery, and
                     the blood followed in such a gush as compelled him to give his whole attention
                     to stopping its flow. He only knew my entrance by the "Ah, Mr. Ingham," of the
                     frightened Irish girl, who stood useless behind the head of the bed.</p>
                  <p>"O Fred," said Morton, without looking up, "I am glad you are here."</p>
                  <p>"And what can I do for you?"</p>
                  <p>"Some whiskey,—first of all."</p>
                  <p>"There are two bottles," said Mary, who was holding the candle,—"in the
                     cupboard behind his dressing-glass."</p>
                  <p>I took Bridget with me, struck a light in the dressing-room (how she blundered
                     about the match), and found the cupboard door locked! Key doubtless in Mary's
                     pocket,—probably in pocket of "another dress." I did not ask. Took my own
                     bunch, willed tremendously that my account-book drawer key should govern the
                     lock, and it did. If it had not, I should have put my fist through the panels.
                     Bottle of bedbug poison; bottle marked "bay rum"; another bottle with no mark;
                     two bottles of Saratoga water. "Set them all on the floor, Bridget." A tall
                     bottle of Cologne. Bottle marked in MS. What in the world is it? "Bring that
                     candle, Bridget." "Eau destillée. Marron, Montreal." What in the world did
                     Lycidas bring distilled water from Montreal for? And then Morton's clear voice
                     in the other room, "As quick as you can, Fred." "Yes! in one moment. Put all
                     these on the floor, Bridget." Here they are at last. "Bourbon whiskey."
                     "Corkscrew, Bridget."</p>
                  <p>"Indade, sir, and where is it?" "Where? I don't know. Run down as quick as you
                     can, and bring it. His wife cannot leave him." So Bridget ran, and the first I
                     heard was the rattle as she pitched down the last six stairs of the first
                     flight headlong. Let us hope she has not broken her leg. I meanwhile am driving
                     a silver pronged fork into the Bourbon corks, and the blade of my own penknife
                     on the other side.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Fred," from George within. (We all call Morton "George.") "Yes, in one
                     moment," I replied. Penknife blade breaks off, fork pulls right out, two crumbs
                     of cork come with it. Will that girl never come?</p>
                  <p>I turned round; I found a goblet on the washstand<pb n="66-67"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000046"/> stand; I took Lycidas's heavy clothes-brush, and
                     knocked off the neck of the bottle. Did you ever do it, reader, with one of
                     those pressed glass bottles they make now? It smashed like a Prince Rupert's
                     drop in my hand, crumbled into seventy pieces,—a nasty smell of whiskey on the
                     floor,—and I, holding just the hard bottom of the thing with two large spikes
                     running worthless up into the air. But I seized the goblet, poured into it what
                     was left in the bottom, and carried it in to Morton as quietly as I could. He
                     bade me give Lycidas as much as he could swallow; then showed me how to
                     substitute my thumb for his, and compress the great artery. When he was
                     satisfied that he could trust me, he began his work again, silently; just
                     speaking what must be said to that brave Mary, who seemed to have three hands
                     because he needed them. When all was secure, he glanced at the ghastly white
                     face, with beads of perspiration on the forehead and upper lip, laid his finger
                     on the pulse, and said: "We will have a little more whiskey. No, Mary, you are
                     overdone already; let Fred bring it." The truth was that poor Mary was almost
                     as white as Lycidas. She would not faint,— that was the only reason she did
                     not,—and at the moment I wondered that she did not fall. I believe George and I
                     were both expecting it, now the excitement was over. He called her Mary, and me
                     Fred, because we were all together every day of our lives. Bridget, you see,
                     was still nowhere.</p>
                  <p>So I retired for my whiskey again,—to attack that other bottle. George
                     whispered quickly as I went, "Bring enough,—bring the bottle." Did he want the
                     bottle corked? Would that Kelt ever come up stairs? I passed the bell-rope as I
                     went into the dressing-room, and rang as hard as I could ring. I took the other
                     bottle, and bit steadily with my teeth at the cork, only, of course, to wrench
                     the end of it off. George called me, and I stepped back. "No," said he, "bring
                     your whiskey."</p>
                  <p>Mary had just rolled gently back on the floor. I went again in despair. But I
                     heard Bridget's step this time. First flight, first passage; second flight,
                     second passage. She ran in in triumph at length, with a
                        <emph>screw-driver!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"No!" I whispered,—"no. The crooked thing you draw corks with," and I showed
                     her the bottle again. "Find one somewhere and<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000047"/> don't come back without it." So she vanished for
                     the second time.</p>
                  <p>"Frederic!" said Morton. I think he never called me so before. Should I risk
                     the clothes-brush again? I opened Lycidas's own drawers,—papers, boxes,
                     everything in order,—not a sign of a tool.</p>
                  <p>"Frederic!" "Yes," I said. But why did I say "Yes"? "Father of Mercy, tell me
                     what to do."</p>
                  <p>And my mazed eyes, dim with tears,—did you ever shed tears from
                     excitement?—fell on an old razor-strop of those days of shaving, made by C.
                     WHITTAKER, SHEFFIELD. The "Sheffield" stood in black letters out from the rest
                     like a vision. They make corkscrews in Sheffield too. If this Whittaker had
                     only made a corkscrew! And what is a "Sheffield wimble"?</p>
                  <p>Hand in my pocket,—brown paper parcel.</p>
                  <p>"Where are you, Frederic?" "Yes," said I, for the last time. Twine off! brown
                     paper off. And I learned that the "Sheffield wimble" was one of those things
                     whose name you never heard before, which people sell you in Thames Tunnel,
                     where a hoof-cleaner, a gimlet, a screw-driver, and a <emph>corkscrew</emph>
                     fold into one handle.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said I, again. "Pop," said the cork. "Bubble, bubble, bubble," said the
                     whiskey. Bottle in one hand, full tumbler in the other, I walked in. George
                     poured half a tumblerful down Lycidas's throat that time. Nor do I dare say how
                     much he poured down afterwards. I found that there was need of it, from what he
                     said of the pulse, when it was all over. I guess Mary had some, too.</p>
                  <p>This was the turning-point. He was exceedingly weak, and we sat by him in turn
                     through the night, giving, at short intervals, stimulants and such food as he
                     could swallow easily; for I remember Morton was very particular not to raise
                     his head more than we could help. But there was no real danger after this.</p>
                  <p>As we turned away from the house on Christmas morning,—I to preach and he to
                     visit his patients,—he said to me, "Did you make that whiskey?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said I, "but poor Dod Dalton had to furnish the corkscrew."</p>
                  <p>And I went down to the chapel to preach. The sermon had been lying ready at
                     home on my desk,—and Polly had brought it round to me,—for there had been no
                     time for me to go<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6578-00000048"/> from Lycidas's home
                     to D Street and to return. There was the text, all as it was the day before:— <q>
                        <p>"They helped every one his neighbor, and every one said to his brother,
                           Be of good courage. So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he
                           that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil."</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there were the pat illustrations, as I had finished them yesterday; of the
                     comfort Mary Magdalen gave Joanna, the court lady; and the comfort the court
                     lady gave Mary Magdalen, after the mediator of a new covenant had mediated
                     between them; how Simon the Cyrenian, and Joseph of Arimathea, and the beggar
                     Bartimeus comforted each other, gave each other strength, common force,
                        <emph>com-fort,</emph> when the One Life flowed in all their veins; how on
                     board the ship the Tent-Maker proved to be Captain, and the Centurion learned
                     his duty from his Prisoner, and how they "<emph>All</emph> came safe to shore,"
                     because the New Life was there. But as I preached, I caught Frye's eye. Frye is
                     always critical; and I said to myself, "Frye would not take his illustrations
                     from eighteen hundred years ago." And I saw dear old Dod Dalton trying to keep
                     awake, and Campbell hard asleep after trying, and Jane Masury looking round to
                     see if her mother did not come in; and Ezra Sheppard, looking, not so much at
                     me, as at the window beside me, as if his thoughts were the other side of the
                     world. And I said to them all, "O, if I could tell you, my friends, what every
                     twelve hours of my life tells me,—of the way in which woman helps woman, and
                     man helps man, when only the ice is broken,—how we are all rich so soon as we
                     find out that we are all brothers, and how we are all in want, unless we can
                     call at any moment for a brother's hand,—then I could make you understand
                     something, in the lives you lead every day, of what the New Covenant, the New
                     Commonwealth, the New Kingdom is to be."</p>
                  <p>But I did not dare tell Dod Dalton what Campbell had been doing for Todd, nor
                     did I dare tell Campbell by what unconscious arts old Dod had been helping
                     Lycidas. Perhaps the sermon would have been better had I done so.</p>
                  <p>But, when we had our tree in the evening at home, I did tell all this story to
                     Polly and the bairns, and I gave Alice her measuring-tape,—precious with a spot
                     of Lycidas's blood,—and<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6578-00000049"/> Bertha her
                     Sheffield wimble. "Papa," said old Clara, who is the next child, "all the
                     people gave presents, did not they, as they did in the picture in your
                     study?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said I, "though they did not all know they were giving them."</p>
                  <p>"Why do they not give such presents every day?" said Clara.</p>
                  <p>"O child," I said, "it is only for thirty-six hours of the three hundred and
                     sixty-five days, that all people remember that they are all brothers and
                     sisters, and those are the hours that we call, therefore, Christmas eve and
                     Christmas day."</p>
                  <p>"And when they always remember it," said Bertha, "it will be Christmas all the
                     time! What fun!</p>
                  <p>"What fun, to be sure; but, Clara, what is in the picture?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, an old woman has brought eggs to the baby in the manger, and an old man
                     has brought a sheep. I suppose they all brought what they had."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose those who came from Sharon brought roses," said Bertha. And Alice,
                     who is eleven, and goes to the Lincoln School, and therefore knows every thing,
                     said,—"Yes, and the Damascus people brought Damascus wimbles."</p>
                  <p>"This is certain," said Polly, "that nobody tried to give a straw, but the
                     straw, if he really gave it, carried a blessing."</p>

               <head>ALICE'S CHRISTMAS-TREE.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>ALICE MACNEIL had made the plan of this Christmas-tree, all by herself and for
                     herself. She had a due estimate of those manufactured trees which hard-worked
                     "Sabbath Schools" get up for rewards of merit for the children who have been
                     regular, and at the last moment have saved attendance-tickets enough. Nor did
                     Alice MacNeil sit in judgment on these. She had a due estimate of them. But for
                     her Christmas-tree she had two plans not included in those more meritorious
                     buddings and bourgeonings of the winter. First, she meant to get it up without
                     any help from anybody. And, secondly, she meant that the boys and girls who had
                     anything from it should be regular laners and by-way farers,—they were to have
                     no tickets of respectability, —they were not in any way to buy their way in;
                     but, for this once, those were to come in to a Christmas-tree who happened to
                     be ragged and in the streets when the Christmas-tree was ready.</p>
                  <p>So Alice asked Mr. Williams, the minister, if she could have one of the rooms
                     in the vestry when Christmas eve came; and he, good saint, was only too glad to
                     let her. He offered, gently, his assistance in sifting out the dirty boys and
                     girls, intimating to Alice that there was dirt and dirt; and that, even in
                     those lowest depths which she was plunging into, there were yet lower deeps
                     which she might find it wise to shun. But here Alice told him frankly that she
                     would rather try her experiment fairly through. Perhaps she was wrong, but she
                     would like to see that she was wrong in her own way. Any way, on Christmas eve,
                     she wanted no distinctions.</p>
                  <p>That part of her plan went bravely forward.</p>
                  <p>Her main difficulty came on the other side,—that she had too many to help her.
                     She was not able to carry out the first part of her plan, and make or buy all
                     her presents herself. For everybody was pleased with this notion of a<pb
                        n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6578-00000051"/> truly catholic or universal tree; and
                     everybody wanted to help. Well, if anybody would send her a box of dominos, or
                     a jack-knife, or an open-eye-shut-eye doll, who was Alice to say it should not
                     go on the tree? and when Mrs. Hesperides sent round a box of Fayal oranges, who
                     was Alice to say that the children should not have oranges? And when Mr. Gorham
                     Parsons sent in well-nigh a barrel full of Hubbardston None-such apples, who
                     was Alice to say they should not have apples? So the tree grew and grew, and
                     bore more and more fruit, till it was clear that there would be more than
                     eighty reliable presents on it, besides apples and oranges, almonds and raisins
                     galore.</p>
                  <p>Now you see this was a very great enlargement of Alice's plan; and it brought
                     her to grief, as you shall see. She had proposed a cosey little tree for
                     fifteen or twenty children. Well, if she had held to that, she would have had
                     no more than she and Lillie, and Mr. Williams, and Mr. Gilmore, and John Flagg,
                     and I, could have managed easily, particularly if mamma was there too. There
                     would have been room enough in the chapel parlor; and it would have been, as I
                     believe, just the pretty and cheerful Christmas jollity that Alice meant it
                     should be. But when it came to eighty presents, and a company of eighty of the
                     unwashed and unticketed, it became quite a different thing.</p>
                  <p>For now Alice began to fear that there would not be children enough in the
                     highways and by-ways. So she started herself, as evening drew on, with George,
                     the old faithful black major-domo, and she walked through the worst streets she
                     knew anything of, of all those near the chapel; and, whenever she saw a brat
                     particularly dirty, or a group of brats particularly forlorn, she sailed up
                     gallantly, and, though she was frightened to death, she invited them to the
                     tree. She gave little admittance cards, that said, "7 o'clock, Christmas Eve,
                     507 Living-stone Avenue," for fear the children would not remember. And she
                     told Mr. Flagg that he and Mr. Gilmore might take some cards and walk out
                     toward Williamsburg, and do the same thing, only they were to be sure that they
                     asked the dirtiest and most forlorn children they saw. There was a friendly
                     policeman with whom Alice had been brought into communication by the boys in
                     her father's office, and he also was permitted to give notice of the tree. But
                        he<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6578-00000052"/> was also to be at the street
                     door, armed with the strong arm of "The People of New York," and when the full
                     quota of eighty had been admitted he was to admit no more.</p>
                  <p>Ah me! My poor Alice issued her cards only too freely. Better indeed, it
                     seemed, had she held to her original plan; at least she thought so, and thinks
                     so to this day. But I am not so certain. A hard time she had of it, however.
                     Quarter of seven found the little Arabs in crowds around the door, with
                     hundreds of others who thought they also were to find out what a "free lunch"
                     was. The faithful officer Purdy was in attendance also; he passed in all who
                     had the cards; he sent away legions, let me say, who had reason to dread him;
                     but still there assembled a larger and larger throng about the door. Alice and
                     Lillie, and the young gentlemen, and Mrs. MacNeil, were all at work up stairs,
                     and the tree was a perfect beauty at last. They lighted up, and nothing could
                     have been more lovely.</p>
                  <p>"Let them in!" said John Flagg rushing to the door, where expectant knocks had
                     been heard already. "Let them in,—the smallest girls first!"</p>
                  <p>"Smallest girls," indeed! The door swung open, and a tide of boy and girl, girl
                     and boy, boy big to hobble-de-hoy-dom, and girl big to young-woman-dom, came
                     surging in, wildly screaming, scolding, pushing, and pulling. Omitting the
                     profanity, these are the Christmas carols that fell on Alice's ear.</p>
                  <p>"Out o' that!" "Take that, then!" "Who are you?" "Hold your jaw!" Can't you
                     behave decent?" "You lie!" "Get out of my light!" "Oh, dear! you killed me!"
                     "Who's killed?" "Golly! see there!" "I say, ma'am, give me that pair of
                     skates!" "Shut up—"and so on, the howls being more and more impertinent, as the
                     shepherds who had come to adore became more and more used to the position they
                     were in.</p>
                  <p>Young Gilmore, who was willing to oblige Alice, but was not going to stand any
                     nonsense, and would have willingly knocked the heads together of any five
                     couples of this rebel rout, mounted on a corner of the railing, which, by Mr.
                     Williams's prescience had been built around the tree, and addressed the riotous
                     assembly.</p>
                  <p>They stopped to hear him, supposing he was to deliver the gifts, to which they
                     had been summoned.</p>
                  <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6578-00000053"/>
                  <p>He told them pretty roundly that if they did not keep the peace, and stop
                     crowding and yelling, they should all be turned out of doors; that they were to
                     pass the little girls and boys forward first, and that nobody would have any
                     thing to eat till this was done.</p>
                  <p>Some approach to obedience followed. A few little waifs were found, who in
                     decency could be called <emph>little</emph> girls and boys. But, alas! as she
                     looked down from her chair, Alice felt as if most of her guests looked like
                     shameless, hulking big boys and big girls, only too well fitted to grapple with
                     the world, and only too eager to accept its gifts without grappling. She and
                     Lillie tried to forget this. They kissed a few little girls, and saw the
                     faintest gleam of pleasure on one or two little faces. But there, also, the
                     pleasure was almost extinct, in fear of the big boys and big girls howling
                     around.</p>
                  <p>So the howling began again, as the distribution went forward. "Give me that
                     jack-knife!" "I say, Mister, I'm as big as he is," "He had one before and hid
                     it," "Be down, Tom Mulligan,—get off that fence or I'll hide you," "I don't
                     want the book, give me them skates," "You sha'n't have the skates, I'll have
                     'em myself—" and so on. John Flagg finally knocked down Tom Mulligan, who had
                     squeezed round behind the tree, in an effort to steal something, and had the
                     satisfaction of sending him bellowing from the room, with his face covered with
                     blood from his nose. Gilmore, meanwhile, was rapidly distributing an orange and
                     an apple to each, which, while the oranges were sucked, gave a moment's quiet.
                     Alice and the ladies, badly frightened, were stripping the tree as fast as they
                     could, and at last announced that it was all clear, with almost as eager joy as
                     half an hour before they had announced that it was all full. "There's a candy
                     horn on top, give me that." "Give me that little apple." "Give me the old
                     sheep." "Hoo! hurrah, for the old sheep!" This of a little lamb which had been
                     placed as an appropriate ornament in front. Then began a howl about oranges. "I
                     want another orange." "Bill's got some, and I've got none." "I say, Mister,
                     give me an orange."</p>
                  <p>To which Mister replied, by opening the window, and speaking into the
                     street,—"I say, Purdy, call four officers and come up and clear this room."</p>
                  <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6578-00000054"/>
                  <p>The room did not wait for the officers: it cleared itself very soon on this
                     order, and was left a scene of wreck and dirt. Orange-peel trampled down on the
                     floor; cake thrown down and mashed to mud, intermixed with that which had come
                     in on boots, and the water which had been slobbered over from hasty mugs; the
                     sugar plums which had fallen in scrambles, and little sprays of green too,
                     trodden into the mass,—all made an aspect of filth like a market side-walk. And
                     poor Alice was half crying and half laughing; poor Lillie was wholly crying.
                     Gilmore and Flagg were explaining to each other how gladly they would have
                     thrashed the whole set.</p>
                  <p>The thought uppermost in Alice's mind was that she had been a clear, out and
                     out fool! And that, probably, is the impression of the greater part of the
                     readers of her story,—or would have been the impression of any one who only had
                     her point of view.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>PERHAPS the reader is willing to take another point of view.</p>
                  <p>As the group stood there, talking over the riot as Mrs. MacNeil called it,—as
                     John Flagg tried to make Alice laugh by bringing her a half-piece of frosted
                     pound-cake, and proving to her that it had not been on the floor,—as she said,
                     her eyes streaming with tears, "I tell you, John! I am a fool, and I know I am,
                     and nobody but a fool would have started such a row,"—as all this happened,
                     Patrick Crehore came back for his little sister's orange which he had wrapped
                     in her handkerchief and left on one of the book-racks in the room. Patrick was
                     alone now, and was therefore sheepish enough, and got himself and his orange
                     out of the room as soon as he well could. But he was sharp enough to note the
                     whole position, and keen enough to catch Alice's words as she spoke to Mr.
                     Flagg. Indeed, the general look of disappointment and chagrin in the room, and
                     the contrast between this filthy ruin and the pretty elegance of half an hour
                     ago, were distinct<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6578-00000055"/> enough to be
                     observed by a much more stupid boy than Patrick Crehore. He went down stairs
                     and found Bridget waiting, and walked home with the little toddler, meditating
                     rather more than was his wont on Alice's phrase, "I tell you, I am a fool."
                     Meditating on it, he haled Bridget up five flights of stairs and broke in on
                     the little room where a table spread with a plentiful supply of tea, baker's
                     bread, butter, cheese, and cabbage, waited their return. Jerry Crehore, his
                     father, sat smoking, and his mother was tidying up the room.</p>
                  <p>"And had ye a good time, me darling? And ye 've brought home your orange, and a
                     doll too, and mittens too. And what did you have, Pat?"</p>
                  <p>So Pat explained, almost sulkily, that he had a checker-board, and a set of
                     checker-men, which he produced; but he put them by as if he hated the sight of
                     them, and for a minute dropped the subject, while he helped little Biddy to
                     cabbage. He ate something himself, drank some tea, and then delivered his rage
                     with much unction, a little profanity, great incoherency,—but to his own
                     relief.</p>
                  <p>"It's a mean thing it is, all of it," said he, "I'll be hanged but it is! I
                     dunno who the lady is; but we 've made her cry bad, I know that; and the boys
                     acted like Nick. They knew that as well as I do. The man there had to knock one
                     of the fellows down, bedad, and served him right, too. I say, the fellows
                     fought, and hollared, and stole, and sure ye 'd thought ye was driving pigs
                     down the Eighth Avenue, and I was as bad as the worst of 'em. That's what the
                     boys did when a lady asked 'em to Christmas."</p>
                  <p>"That was a mean thing to do," said Jerry, taking his pipe from his mouth for a
                     longer speech than he had ever been known to make while smoking.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Crehore stopped in her dish-wiping, sat down, and gave her opinion. She
                     did not know what a Christmas-tree was, having never seed one nor heared of
                     one. But she did know that those who went to see a lady should show manners and
                     behave like jintlemen, or not go at all. She expressed her conviction that Tom
                     Mulligan was rightly served, and her regret that he had not two black eyes
                     instead of one. She would have been glad, indeed, if certain Floyds, and
                     Sullivans, and Flahertys with whose<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6578-00000056"/>
                     names of baptism she was better acquainted than I am, had shared a similar
                     fate.</p>
                  <p>This oration, and the oracle of his father still more, appeased Pat somewhat;
                     and when his supper was finished, after long silence, he said, "We 'll give her
                     a Christmas present. We will. Tom Mulligan and Bill Floyd and I will give it.
                     The others sha'n't know. I know what we'll give her. I'll tell Bill Floyd that
                     we made her cry."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <p>AFTER supper, accordingly, Pat Crehore repaired to certain rendezvous of the
                     younger life of the neighborhood, known to him, in search of Bill Floyd. Bill
                     was not at the first, nor at the second, there being indeed no rule or
                     principle known to men or even to archangels by which Bill's presence at any
                     particular spot at any particular time could be definitely stated. But Bill
                     also, in his proud free-will, obeyed certain general laws; and accordingly Pat
                     found him inspecting, as a volunteer officer of police, the hauling out and
                     oiling of certain hose at the house of a neighboring boring hose company. "Come
                     here, Bill. I got something to show you."</p>
                  <p>Bill had already carried home and put in safe keeping a copy of Routledge's
                     "Robinson Crusoe," which had been given to him.</p>
                  <p>He left the hose inspection willingly, and hurried along with Pat, past many
                     attractive groups, not even stopping where a brewer's horse had fallen on the
                     ground, till Pat brought him in triumph to the gaudy window of a shoe-shop,
                     lighted up gayly and full of the wares by which even shoe-shops lure in
                     customers for Christmas.</p>
                  <p>"See there!" said Pat, nearly breathless. And he pointed to the very centre of
                     the display, a pair of slippers made from bronze-gilt kid, and displaying a
                     hideous blue silk bow upon the gilding. For what class of dancers or of maskers
                     these slippers may have been made, or by what canon of beauty, I know not. Only
                     they were the centre of decoration in the shoe-shop window. Pat looked at them
                     with admiration, as he had often done, and said again to Bill Floyd, "See
                     there, ain't them handsome?"</p>
                  <p>"Golly!" said Bill, "I guess so."</p>
                  <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6578-00000057"/>
                  <p>"Bill, let's buy them little shoes, and give 'em to her."</p>
                  <p>"Give 'em to who?" said Bill, from whose mind the Christmas-tree had for the
                     moment faded, under the rivalry of the hose company, the brewer's horse, and
                     the shop window. "Give 'em to who?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, her, I don't know who she is. The gal that made the what-do-ye-call-it,
                     the tree, you know, and give us the oranges, where old Purdy was. I say, Bill,
                     it was a mean dirty shame to make such a row there, when we was bid to a party;
                     and I want to make the gal a present, for I see her crying, Bill. Crying cos it
                     was such a row." Again, I omit certain profane expressions which did not add
                     any real energy to the declaration.</p>
                  <p>"They is handsome," said Bill, meditatingly. "Ain't the blue ones
                     handsomest?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Pat, who saw he had gained his lodgment, and that the carrying his
                     point was now only a matter of time. "The gould ones is the ones for me. We 'll
                     give 'em to the gal for a Christmas present, you and I and Tom Mulligan."</p>
                  <p>Bill Floyd did not dissent, being indeed in the habit of going as he was led,
                     as were most of the "rebel rout" with whom he had an hour ago been acting. He
                     assented entirely to Pat's proposal. By "Christmas" both parties understood
                     that the present was to be made before Twelfth Night, not necessarily on
                     Christmas day. Neither of them had a penny; but both of them knew, perfectly
                     well, that whenever they chose to get a little money they could do so.</p>
                  <p>They soon solved their first question, as to the cost of the coveted slippers.
                     True, they knew, of course, that they would be ejected from the decent shop if
                     they went in to inquire. But, by lying in wait, they soon discovered Delia
                     Sullivan, a decent-looking girl they knew, passing by, and having made her
                     their confidant, so far that she was sure she was not fooled, they sent her in
                     to inquire. The girl returned to announce, to the astonishment of all parties,
                     that the shoes cost six dollars.</p>
                  <p>"Hew!" cried Pat, "six dollars for them are! I bought my mother's new
                     over-shoes for one." But not the least did he 'bate of his determination, and
                     he and Bill Floyd went in search of Tom Mulligan.</p>
                  <p>Tom was found as easily as Bill. But it was<pb n="90-91"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000058"/> not so easy to enlist him. Tom was in a regular
                     corner liquor store with men who were sitting smoking, drinking, and telling
                     dirty stories. Either of the other boys would have been whipped at home if he
                     had been known to be seen sitting in this place, and the punishment would have
                     been well bestowed. But Tom Mulligan had had nobody thrash him for many a day
                     till John Flagg had struck out so smartly from the shoulder. Perhaps, had there
                     been some thrashing as discriminating as Jerry Flaherty's, it had been better
                     for Tom Mulligan. The boys found him easily enough, but, as I said, had some
                     difficulty in getting him away. With many assurances, however, that they had
                     something to tell him, and something to show him, they lured him from the
                     shadow of the comfortable stove into the night.</p>
                  <p>Pat Crehore, who had more of the tact of oratory than he knew, then boldly told
                     Tom Mulligan the story of the Christmas-tree, as it passed after Tom's
                     ejection. Tom was sour at first, but soon warmed to the narrative, and even
                     showed indignation at the behavior of boys who had seemed to carry themselves
                     less obnoxiously than he did. All the boys agreed, that but for certain others
                     who had never been asked to come, and ought to be ashamed to be there with them
                     as were, there would have been no row. They all agreed that on some suitable
                     occasion unknown to me and to this story they would take vengeance on these
                     Tidds and Sullivans. When Pat Crehore wound up his statement, by telling how he
                     saw the ladies crying, and all the pretty room looking like a pig-sty, Tom
                     Mulligan was as loud as he was in saying that it was all wrong, and that nobody
                     but blackguards would have joined in it, in particular such blackguards as the
                     Tidds and Sullivans above alluded to.</p>
                  <p>Then to Tom's sympathizing ear was confided the project of the gold shoes, as
                     the slippers were always called, in this honorable company. And Tom completely
                     approved. He even approved the price. He explained to the others that it would
                     be mean to give to a lady any thing of less price. This was exactly the sum
                     which recommended itself to his better judgment. And so the boys went home,
                     agreeing to meet Christmas morning as a Committee of Ways and Means.</p>
                  <p>To the discussions of this committee I need<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000059"/> not admit you. Many plans were proposed: one
                     that they should serve through the holidays at certain ten-pin alleys, known to
                     them; one that they should buy off Fogarty from his newspaper route for a few
                     days. But the decision was, that Pat, the most decent in appearance, should
                     dress up in a certain Sunday suit he had, and offer the services of himself,
                     and two unknown friends of his, as extra cork-boys at Birnebaum's brewery,
                     where Tom Mulligan reported they were working nights, that they might fill an
                     extra order. This device succeeded. Pat and his friends were put on duty, for
                     trial, on the night of the 26th; and, the foreman of the corking-room being
                     satisfied, they retained their engagements till New Year's eve, when they were
                     paid three dollars each, and resigned their positions.</p>
                  <p>"Let's buy her three shoes!" said Bill, in enthusiasm at their success. But
                     this proposal was rejected. Each of the other boys had a private plan for an
                     extra present to "her" by this time. The sacred six dollars was folded up in a
                     bit of straw paper from the brewery, and the young gentlemen went home to make
                     their toilets, a process they had had no chance to go through, on Christmas
                     eve. After this, there was really no difficulty about their going into the
                     shoe-shop, and none about consummating the purchase,—to the utter astonishment
                     of the dealer. The gold shoes were bought, rolled up in paper, and ready for
                     delivery.</p>
                  <p>Bill Floyd had meanwhile learned, by inquiry at the chapel, where she lived,
                     though there were doubts whether any of them knew her name. The others rejected
                     his proposals that they should take street cars, and they boldly pushed afoot
                     up to Clinton Avenue, and rang, not without terror, at the door.</p>
                  <p>Terror did not diminish when black George appeared, whose acquaintance they had
                     made at the tree. But fortunately George did not recognize them in their
                     apparel of elegance. When they asked for the "lady that gave the tree," he bade
                     them wait a minute, and in less than a minute Alice came running out to meet
                     them. To the boys' great delight, she was not crying now.</p>
                  <p>"If you please, ma'am," said Tom, who had been commissioned as spokesman,—"if
                     you please, them's our Christmas present to you, ma'am. Them's gold shoes. And
                        please,<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6578-00000060"/> ma'am, we 're very sorry
                     there was such a row at the Christmas, ma'am. It was mean, ma'am. Good-by,
                     ma'am."</p>
                  <p>Alice's eyes were opening wider and wider, nor at this moment did she
                     understand. "Gold shoes," and "row at the Christmas," stuck by her, however;
                     and she understood there was a present. So, of course, she said the right
                     thing, by accident, and did the right thing, being a lady through and
                     through.</p>
                  <p>"No, you must not go away. Come in, boys, come in. I did not know you, you
                     know." As how should she. "Come in and sit down."</p>
                  <p>"Can't ye take off your hat?" said Tom, in an aside to Pat, who had neglected
                     this reverence as he entered. And Tom was thus a little established in his own
                     esteem.</p>
                  <p>And Alice opened the parcel, and had her presence of mind by this time; and,
                     amazed as she was at the gold shoes, showed no amazement,—nay, even slipped off
                     her own slipper, and showed that the gold shoe fitted, to the delight of Tom,
                     who was trying to explain that the man would change them if they were too
                     small. She found an apple for each boy, thanked and praised each one
                     separately; and the interview would have been perfect, had she not innocently
                     asked Tom what was the matter with his eye. Tom's eye! Why, it was the black
                     eye John Flagg gave him. I am sorry to say Bill Floyd sniggered; but Pat came
                     to the front this time, and said "a man hurt him." Then Alice produced some
                     mittens, which had been left, and asked whose those were. But the boys did not
                     know.</p>
                  <p>"I say, fellars, I 'm going down to the writing-school, at the Union," said
                     Pat, when they got into the street, all of them being in the mood that conceals
                     emotion. "I say, let's all go."</p>
                  <p>To this they agreed.</p>
                  <p>"I say, I went there last week Monday, with Meg McManus. I say, fellars, it's
                     real good fun."</p>
                  <p>The other fellows, having on the unfamiliar best rig, were well aware that they
                     must not descend to their familiar haunts, and all consented.</p>
                  <p>To the amazement of the teacher, these three hulking boys allied themselves to
                     the side of order, took their places as they were bidden, turned the public
                     opinion of the class, and made the Botany Bay of the school to be its quietest
                     class that night.</p>

                  <p>To his amazement the same result followed the next night. And to his greater
                     amazement, the next.</p>
                  <p>To Alice's amazement, she received on Twelfth Night a gilt valentine envelope,
                     within which, on heavily ruled paper, were announced these truths:—</p>

                     it ended, he wrote the best hand of any of them.</p>
                  <p>To my amazement, one evening when I looked in at Longman's, two years to a day
                     after Alice's tree, a bright black-eyed young man, who had tied up for me the
                     copy of Masson's "Milton," which I had given myself for a Christmas present,
                     said: "You don't remember me." I owned innocence.</p>
                  <p>"My name is Mulligan—Thomas Mulligan. Would you thank Mr. John Flagg, if you
                     meet him, for a Christmas present he gave me two years ago, at Miss Alice
                     MacNeil's Christmas-tree. It was the best present I ever had, and the only one
                     I ever deserved."</p>
                  <p>And I said I would do so.</p>
                  <p>I told Alice afterward never to think she was going to catch all the fish there
                     were in any school. I told her to whiten the water with ground-bait enough for
                     all, and to thank God if her heavenly fishing were skilful enough to save
                     one.</p>

                  <p>"AND how is he?" said Robert, as he came in from his day's work, in every
                     moment of which he had thought of his child. He spoke in a whisper to his wife,
                     who met him in the narrow entry at the head of the stairs. And in a whisper she
                     replied.</p>
                  <p>"He is certainly no worse," said Mary: "the docter says, maybe a shade better.
                     At least," she said, sitting on the lower step, and holding her husband's hand,
                     and still whispering,—"at least he said that the breathing seemed to him a
                     shade easier, one lung seemed to him a little more free, and that it is now a
                     question of time and nourishment."</p>
                  <p>"Nourishment?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, nourishment,—and I own my heart sunk as he said so. Poor little thing, he
                     loathes the slops, and I told the doctor so. I told him the struggle and fight
                     to get them down his poor little throat gave him more flush and fever than any
                     thing. And then he begged me not to try that again, asked if there were really
                     nothing that the child would take, and suggested every thing so kindly. But the
                     poor little thing, weak as he is, seems to rise up with supernatural strength
                     against them all. I am not sure, though, but perhaps we may do something with
                     the old milk and water: that is really my only hope now, and that is the reason
                     I spoke to you so cheerfully."</p>
                  <p>Then poor Mary explained more at length that Emily had brought in Dr.
                     Cummings's Manual<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"
                        >1</ref>
                      about the use of milk with children, and that they had sent round to
                     the Corlisses', who always had good milk, and had set a pint according to the
                     direction and formula,—and that though dear little Jamie had refused the groats
                     and the barley, and I know not what else, that at six he had gladly taken all
                     the watered milk they dared to give him, and that it now had rested on his
                     stomach half an hour,

                     could not but hope that the tide had turned, only she hoped with trembling,

                  <p>This rapid review in her entry, of the bulletins of a day, is really the
                     beginning of this Christmas story. No matter which day it was,—it was a little
                     before Christmas, and one of the shortest days, but I have forgotten which.
                     Enough that the baby, for he was a baby still, just entering his thirteenth
                     month,—enough that he did relish the milk, so carefully measured and prepared,
                     and hour by hour took his little dole of it as if it had come from his mother's
                     breast. Enough that three or four days went by so, the little thing lying so
                     still on his back in his crib, his lips still so blue, and his skin of such
                     deadly color against the white of his pillow, and that, twice a day, as Dr.
                     Morton came in and felt his pulse, and listened to the panting, he smiled and
                     looked pleased, and said, "We are getting on better than I dared expect." Only
                     every time he said, "Does he still relish the milk?" and every time was so
                     pleased to know that he took to it still, and every day he added a teaspoonful
                     or two to the hourly dole,—and so poor Mary's heart was lifted day by day.</p>
                  <p>This lasted till St. Victoria's day. Do you know which day that is? It is the
                     second day before Christmas; and here, properly speaking, the story begins.</p>

                  <head type="sub">ST. VICTORIA'S DAY.</head>
                  <p>ST. VICTORIA'S day the doctor was full two hours late. Mary was not anxious
                     about this. She was beginning to feel bravely about the boy, and no longer
                     counted the minutes till she could hear the door-bell ring. When he came he
                     loitered in the entry below,—or she thought he did. He was long coming up
                     stairs. And when he came in she saw that he was excited by something,—was
                     really even then panting for breath.</p>
                  <p>"I am here at last," he said. "Did you think I should fail you?"</p>
                  <p>Why, no,—poor innocent Mary had not thought any such thing. She had known he
                     would come,—and baby was so well that she had not minded his delay.</p>
                  <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6578-00000064"/>
                  <p>Morton looked up at the close drawn shades, which shut out the light, and said,
                     "You did not think of the storm?"</p>
                  <p>"Storm? no!" said poor Mary. She had noticed, when Robert went to the door at
                     seven and she closed it after him, that some snow was falling. But she had not
                     thought of it again. She had kissed him, told him to keep up good heart, and
                     had come back to her baby.</p>
                  <p>Then the doctor told her that the storm which had begun before daybreak had
                     been gathering more and more severely; that the drifts were already heavier
                     than he remembered them in all his Boston life; that after half an hour's trial
                     in his sleigh he had been glad to get back to the stable with his horse; and
                     that all he had done since he had done on foot, with difficulty she could not
                     conceive of. He had been so long down stairs while he brushed the snow off,
                     that he might be fit to come near the child.</p>
                  <p>"And really, Mrs. Walter, we are doing so well here," he said cheerfully, "that
                     I will not try to come round this afternoon, unless you see a change. If you
                     do, your husband must come up for me, you know. But you will not need me, I am
                     sure."</p>
                  <p>Mary felt quite brave to think that they should not need him really for
                     twenty-four hours, and said so; and added, with the first smile he had seen for
                     a fortnight: "I do not know anybody to whom it is of less account than to me,
                     whether the streets are blocked or open. Only I am sorry for you."</p>
                  <p>Poor Mary, how often she thought of that speech, before Christmas day went by!
                     But she did not think of it all through St. Victoria's day. Her husband did not
                     come home to dinner. She did not expect him. The children came from school at
                     two, rejoicing in the long morning session and the half holiday of the
                     afternoon which had been earned by it. They had some story of their frolic in
                     the snow, and after dinner went quietly away to their little play-room in the
                     attic. And Mary sat with her baby all the afternoon,—nor wanted other company.
                     She could count his breathing now, and knew how to time it by the watch, and
                     she knew that it was steadier and slower than it was the day before. And really
                     he almost showed an appetite for the hourly dole. Her husband was not late. He
                     had taken care of that, and had left the shop an hour early. And<pb n="104-105"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000065"/> as he came in and looked at the child from the
                     other side of the crib, and smiled so cheerfully on her, Mary felt that she
                     could not enough thank God for his mercy.</p>

                  <head type="sub">ST. VICTORIA'S DAY IN THE COUNTRY.</head>
                  <p>FIVE and twenty miles away was another mother, with a baby born the same day as
                     Jamie. Mary had never heard of her and never has heard of her, and, unless she
                     reads this story, never will hear of her till they meet together in the other
                     home, look each other in the face, and know as they are known. Yet their two
                     lives, as you shall see, are twisted together, as indeed are all lives, only
                     they do not know it—as how should they?</p>
                  <p>A great day for Huldah Stevens was this St. Victoria's day. Not that she knew
                     its name more than Mary did. Indeed it was only of late years that Huldah
                     Stevens had cared much for keeping Christmas day. But of late years they had
                     all thought of it more; and this year, on Thanksgiving day, at old Mr.
                     Stevens's, after great joking about the young people's housekeeping, it had
                     been determined, with some banter, that the same party should meet with John
                     and Huldah on Christmas eve, with all Huldah's side of the house besides, to a
                     late dinner or early supper, as the guests might please to call it. Little
                     difference between the meals, indeed, was there ever in the profusion of these
                     country homes. The men folks were seldom at home at the noon-day meal, call it
                     what you will. For they were all in the milk-business, as you will see. And,
                     what with collecting the milk from the hill-farms, on the one hand, and then
                     carrying it for delivery at the three o'clock morning milk-train, on the other
                     hand, any hours which you, dear reader, might consider systematic, or of course
                     in country life, were certainly always set aside. But, after much conference,
                     as I have said, it had been determined at the Thanksgiving party that all hands
                     in both families should meet at John and Huldah's as near three o'clock as they
                     could the day before Christmas; and then and there Huldah was to show her
                     powers in entertaining at her first state family party.</p>
                  <p>So this St. Victoria's day was a great day of<pb n="106-107"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000066"/> preparation for Huldah, if she had only known
                     its name, as she did not. For she was of the kind which prepares in time, not
                     of the kind that is caught out when the company come with the work half done.
                     And as John started on his collection beat that morning at about the hour
                     Robert, in town, kissed Mary good-by, Huldah stood on the step with him, and
                     looked with satisfaction on the gathering snow, because it would make better
                     sleighing the next day for her father and mother to come over. She charged him
                     not to forget her box of raisins when he came back, and to ask at the express
                     if anything came up from town, bade him good-by, and turned back into the
                     house, not wholly dissatisfied to be almost alone. She washed her baby, gave
                     him his first lunch and put him to bed. Then, with the coast fairly clear,—what
                     woman does not enjoy a clear coast, if it only be early enough in the
                     morning?—she dipped boldly and wisely into her flour-barrel, stripped her plump
                     round arms to their work, and began on the pie-crust which was to appear
                     to-morrow in the fivefold forms of apple, cranberry, Marlboro', mince, and
                     squash,—careful and discriminating in the nice chemistry of her mixtures and
                     the nice manipulations of her handicraft, but in nowise dreading the issue. A
                     long, active, lively morning she had of it. Not dissatisfied with the stages of
                     her work, step by step she advanced, stage by stage she attained of the
                     elaborate plan which was well laid out in her head, but, of course, had never
                     been intrusted to words, far less to tell-tale paper. From the oven at last
                     came the pies,—and she was satisfied with the color; from the other oven came
                     the turkey, which she proposed to have cold,—as a relay, or <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">pièce de résistance,</foreign> for any who might not be at
                     hand at the right moment for dinner. Into the empty oven went the
                     clove-blossoming ham, which, as it boiled, had given the least appetizing odor
                     to the kitchen. In the pretty moulds in the woodshed stood the translucent
                     cranberry hardening to its fixed consistency. In other moulds the obedient
                     calf's foot already announced its willingness and intention to "gell" as she
                     directed. Huldah's decks were cleared again, her kitchen table fit to cut out
                     "work" upon,—all the pans and plates were put away, which accumulate so
                     mysteriously where cooking is going forward; on its nail hung the weary jigger,
                     on its hook the spicy<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6578-00000067"/> grater, on the
                     roller a fresh towel. Everything gave sign of victory, the whole kitchen
                     looking only a little nicer than usual. Huldah herself was dressed for the
                     afternoon, and so was the baby; and nobody but as acute observers as you and I
                     would have known that she had been in action all along the line and had won the
                     battle at every point, when two o'clock came, the earliest moment at which her
                     husband ever returned.</p>
                  <p>Then for the first time it occurred to Huldah to look out doors and see how
                     fast the snow was gathering. She knew it was still falling. But the storm was a
                     quiet one, and she had had too much to do to be gaping out of the windows. She
                     went to the shed door, and to her amazement saw that the north wood-pile was
                     wholly drifted in! Nor could she, as she stood, see the fences of the
                     roadway!</p>
                  <p>Huldah ran back into the house, opened the parlor door and drew up the curtain,
                     to see that there were indeed no fences on the front of the house to be seen.
                     On the northwest, where the wind had full sweep,—between her and the barn, the
                     ground was bare. But all that snow—and who should say how much more?—was piled
                     up in front of her; so that unless Huldah had known every landmark, she would
                     not have suspected that any road was ever there. She looked uneasily out at the
                     northwest windows, but she could not see an inch to windward: dogged
                     snow—snow—snow—as if it would never be done.</p>
                  <p>Huldah knew very well then that there was no husband for her in the next hour,
                     nor most like in the next or the next. She knew very well too what she had to
                     do; and, knowing it, she did it. She tied on her hood, and buttoned tight
                     around her her rough sack, passed through the shed and crossed that bare strip
                     to the barn, opened the door with some difficulty, because snow was already
                     drifting into the doorway, and entered. She gave the cows and oxen their water
                     and the two night horses theirs,—went up into the loft and pitched down hay
                     enough for all,—went down stairs to the pigs and cared for them,—took one of
                     the barn shovels and cleared a path where she had had to plunge into the snow
                     at the doorway, took the shovel back, and then crossed home again to her baby.
                     She thought she saw the Empsons' chimney smoking as she went home, and<pb
                        n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6578-00000068"/> that seemed companionable. She took
                     off her over-shoes, sack, and hood, said aloud, "This will be a good
                     stay-at-home day," brought round her desk to the kitchen table, and began on a
                     nice long letter to her brother Cephas in Seattle.</p>
                  <p>That letter was finished, eight good quarto pages written, and a long delayed
                     letter to Emily Tabor, whom Huldah had not seen since she was married; and a
                     long pull at her milk accounts had brought them up to date,—and still no John.
                     Huldah had the table all set, you may be sure of that; but, for herself, she
                     had had no heart to go through the formalities of lunch or dinner. A cup of tea
                     and something to eat with it as she wrote did better, she thought, for her,—and
                     she could eat when the men came. It is a way women have. Not till it became
                     quite dark, and she set her kerosene lamp in the window that he might have a
                     chance to see it when he turned the Locust Grove corner, did Huldah once feel
                     herself lonely, or permit herself to wish that she did not live in a place
                     where she could be cut off from all her race. "If John had gone into
                     partnership with Joe Winter and we had lived in Boston." This was the thought
                     that crossed her mind. Dear Huldah,—from the end of one summer to the beginning
                     of the next, Joe Winter does not go home to his dinner; and what you experience
                     to-day, so far as absence from your husband goes, is what his wife experiences
                     in Boston ten months, save Sundays, in every year.</p>
                  <p>I do not mean that Huldah winced or whined. Not she. Only she did think "if."
                     Then she sat in front of the stove and watched the coals, and for a little
                     while continued to think "if." Not long. Very soon she was engaged in planning
                     how she would arrange the table to-morrow,—whether Mother Stevens should cut
                     the chicken-pie, or whether she would have that in front of her own mother.
                     Then she fell to planning what she would make for Cynthia's baby,—and then to
                     wondering whether Cephas was in earnest in that half nonsense he wrote about
                     Sibyl Dyer,—and then the clock struck six!</p>
                  <p>No bells yet,—no husband,—no anybody. Lantern out and lighted. Rubber boots on,
                     hood and sack. Shed-shovel in one hand, lantern in the other. Roadway still
                     bare, but a<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6578-00000069"/> drift as high as
                     Huldah's shoulders at the barn door. Lantern on the ground; snow-shovel in both
                     hands now. One, two, three!—one cubic foot out. One, two, three!—another cubic
                     foot out. And so on, and so on, and so on, till the doorway is clear again.
                     Lantern in one hand, snow-shovel in the other, we enter the barn, draw the
                     water for cows and oxen,—we shake down more hay, and see to the pigs again.
                     This time we make beds of straw for the horses and the cattle. Nay, we linger a
                     minute or two, for there is something companionable there. Then we shut them
                     in, in the dark, and cross the well-cleared roadway to the shed, and so home
                     again. Certainly Mrs. Empson's kerosene lamp is in her window. That must be her
                     light which gives a little halo in that direction in the falling snow. That
                     looks like society.</p>
                  <p>And this time Huldah undresses the baby, puts on her yellow flannel
                     night-gown,—makes the whole as long as it may be,—and then, still making
                     believe be jolly, lights another lamp, eats her own supper, clears it away, and
                     cuts into the new Harper which John had brought up to her the day before.</p>
                  <p>But the Harper is dull reading to her, though generally so attractive. And when
                     her Plymouth-Hollow clock consents to strike eight at last, Huldah, who has
                     stinted herself to read till eight, gladly puts down the "Travels in Arizona,"
                     which seem to her as much like the "Travels in Peru," of the month before, as
                     those had seemed like the "Travels in Chinchilla." Rubber boots again,—lantern
                     again,—sack and hood again. The men will be in no case for milking when they
                     come. So Huldah brings together their pails,—takes her shovel once more and her
                     lantern,—digs out the barn drift again, and goes over to milk little Carry and
                     big Fanchon. For, though the milking of a hundred cows passes under those roofs
                     and out again every day, Huldah is far too conservative to abandon the custom
                     which she inherits from some Thorfinn or some Elfrida, and her husband is well
                     pleased to humor her in keeping in that barn always, at least two of the
                     choicest three-quarter blood cows that he can choose, for the family supply.
                     Only, in general, he or Reuben milks them; as duties are divided there, this is
                     not Huldah's share. But on this eve of St. Spiridion the gentle creatures<pb
                        n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6578-00000070"/> ures were glad when she came in; and
                     in two journeys back and forth Huldah had carried her well-filled pails into
                     her dairy. This helped along the hour, and just after nine o'clock struck, she
                     could hear the cheers of the men at last. She ran out again with the ready
                     lighted lantern to the shed-door,—in an instant had on her boots and sack and
                     hood, had crossed to the barn, and slid open the great barn door,—and stood
                     there with her light,—another Hero for another Leander to buffet towards,
                     through the snow. A sight to see were the two men, to be sure! And a story,
                     indeed, they had to tell! On their different beats they had fought snow all
                     day, had been breaking roads with the help of the farmers where they could, had
                     had to give up more than half of the outlying farms, sending such messages as
                     they might, that the outlying farmers might bring down to-morrow's milk to such
                     stations as they could arrange, and, at last, by good luck, had both met at the
                     dépôt in the hollow, where each had gone to learn at what hour the milk-train
                     might be expected in the morning. Little reason was there, indeed, to expect it
                     at all. Nothing had passed the station-master since the morning express, called
                     lightning by satire, had slowly pushed up with three or four engines five hours
                     behind its time, and just now had come down a messenger from them that he
                     should telegraph to Boston that they were all blocked up at Tyler's Summit,—the
                     snow drifting beneath their wheels faster than they could clear it. Above, the
                     station-master said, nothing whatever had yet passed Winchendon. Five engines
                     had gone out from Fitchburg eastward, but in the whole day they had not come as
                     far as Leominster. It was very clear that no milk-train nor any other train
                     would be on time the next morning.</p>
                  <p>Such was, in brief, John's report to Huldah, when they had got to that state of
                     things in which a man can make a report; that is, after they had rubbed dry the
                     horses, had locked up the barn, after the men had rubbed themselves dry, and
                     had put on dry clothing, and after each of them, sitting on the fire side of
                     the table, had drunk his first cup of tea, and eaten his first square cubit of
                     dipped-toast. After the dipped-toast, they were going to begin on Huldah's
                     fried potatoes and sausages.</p>
                  <p>Huldah heard their stories with all their infinite<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000071"/> nite little details; knew every corner and turn
                     by which they had husbanded strength and life; was grateful to the Corbetts and
                     Varnums and Prescotts and the rest, who, with their oxen and their red right
                     hands, had given such loyal help for the common good; and she heaved a deep
                     sigh when the story ended with the verdict of the failure of the whole,—"No
                     trains on time to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"Bad for the Boston babies," said Reuben bluntly, giving words to what the
                     others were feeling. "Poor little things!" said Huldah, "Alice has been so
                     pretty all day." And she gulped down just one more sigh, disgusted with
                     herself, as she remembered that "if" of the afternoon,—"if John had only gone
                     into partnership with Joe Winter."</p>

                  <head type="sub">HOW THEY BROKE THE BLOCKADE.</head>
                  <p>THREE o'clock in the morning saw Huldah's fire burning in the stove, her water
                     boiling in the kettle, her slices of ham broiling on the gridiron, and
                     quarter-past three saw the men come across from the barn, where they had been
                     shaking down hay for the cows and horses, and yoking the oxen for the terrible
                     onset of the day. It was bright star-light above,—thank Heaven for that. This
                     strip of three hundred thousand square miles of snow cloud, which had been
                     drifting steadily east over a continent, was, it seemed, only twenty hours
                     wide,—say two hundred miles, more or less,—and at about midnight its last
                     flecks had fallen, and all the heaven was washed black and clear. The men were
                     well rested by those five hours of hard sleep. They were fitly dressed for
                     their great encounter and started cheerily upon it, as men who meant to do
                     their duty, and to both of whom, indeed, the thought had come, that life and
                     death might be trembling in their hands. They did not take out the pungs
                     to-day, nor, of course, the horses. Such milk as they had collected on St.
                     Victoria's day they had stored already at the station, and at Stacy's; and the
                     best they could do to-day would be to break open the road from the Four Corners
                     to the station, that they might place as many cans as possible there before the
                     down-train came. From the house, then, they had only to drive down their oxen
                     that they might work with the other<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6578-00000072"/>
                     teams from the Four Corners; and it was only by begging him, that Huldah
                     persuaded Reuben to take one lunch-can for them both. Then, as Reuben left the
                     door, leaving John to kiss her "good-by," and to tell her not to be alarmed if
                     they did not come home at night,—she gave to John the full milk-can into which
                     she had poured every drop of Carry's milk, and said, "It will be one more; and
                     God knows what child may be crying for it now."</p>
                  <p>So they parted for eight and twenty hours; and in place of Huldah's first state
                     party of both families, she and Alice reigned solitary that day, and held their
                     little court with never a suitor. And when her lunch-time came, Huldah looked
                     half-mournfully, half-merrily, on her array of dainties prepared for the feast,
                     and she would not touch one of them. She toasted some bread before the fire,
                     made a cup of tea, boiled an egg, and would not so much as set the table. As
                     has been before stated, this is the way with women.</p>
                  <p>And of the men, who shall tell the story of the pluck and endurance, of the
                     unfailing goodwill, of the resource in strange emergency, of the mutual help
                     and common courage with which all the men worked that day on that well-nigh
                     hopeless task of breaking open the highway from the Corners to the station?
                     Well-nigh hopeless, indeed; for although at first, with fresh cattle and united
                     effort, they made in the hours, which passed so quickly up to ten o'clock, near
                     two miles headway, and had brought yesterday's milk thus far,—more than half
                     way to their point of delivery,—at ten o'clock it was quite evident that this
                     sharp northwest wind, which told so heavily on the oxen and even on the men,
                     was filling in the very roadway they had opened, and so was cutting them off
                     from their base, and, by its new drifts, was leaving the roadway for to-day's
                     milk even worse than it was when they began. In one of those extemporized
                     councils, then,—such as fought the battle of Bunker Hill, and threw the tea
                     into Boston harbor,—it was determined, at ten o'clock, to divide the working
                     parties. The larger body should work back to the Four Corners, and by proper
                     relays keep that trunk line of road open, if they could; while six yoke, with
                     their owners, still pressing forward to the station, should make a new base at
                     Lovejoy's, where, when these oxen gave out, they could be<pb n="120-121"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000073"/> put up at his barn. It was quite clear, indeed,
                     to the experts that that time was not far distant.</p>
                  <p>And so, indeed, it proved. By three in the afternoon, John and Reuben and the
                     other leaders of the advance party—namely, the whole of it, for such is the
                     custom of New England—gathered around the fire at Lovejoy's, conscious that
                     after twelve hours of such battle as Pavia never saw, nor Roncesvalles, they
                     were defeated at every point but one. Before them the mile of road which they
                     had made in the steady work of hours was drifted in again as smooth as the
                     surrounding pastures, only if possible a little more treacherous for the labor
                     which they had thrown away upon it. The oxen which had worked kindly and
                     patiently, well handled by good-tempered men, yet all confused and half dead
                     with exposure, could do no more. Well, indeed, if those that had been stalled
                     fast, and had had to stand in that biting wind after gigantic effort, escaped
                     with their lives from such exposure. All that the men had gained was that they
                     had advanced their first dépôt of milk—two hundred and thirty-nine cans—as far
                     as Lovejoy's. What supply might have worked down to the Four Corners behind
                     them, they did not know and hardly cared, their communications that way being
                     well-nigh cut off again. What they thought of, and planned for, was simply how
                     these cans at Lovejoy's could be put on any downward train. For by this time
                     they knew that all trains would have lost their grades and their names, and
                     that this milk would go into Boston by the first engine that went there, though
                     it rode on the velvet of a palace car.</p>
                  <p>What train this might be, they did not know. From the hill above Lovejoy's they
                     could see poor old Dix, the station-master, with his wife and boys, doing his
                     best to make an appearance of shovelling in front of his little station. But
                     Dix's best was but little, for he had but one arm, having lost the other in a
                     collision, and so as a sort of pension the company had placed him at this
                     little flag-station, where was a roof over his head, a few tickets to sell, and
                     generally very little else to do. It was clear enough that no working parties
                     on the railroad had worked up to Dix, or had worked down; nor was it very
                     likely that any would before night, unless the railroad people had better luck
                     with their drifts than our friends had found. But, as to this, who<pb
                        n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6578-00000074"/> should say? Snow-drifts are "mighty
                     onsartain." The line of that road is in general northwest, and to-day's wind
                     might have cleaned out its gorges as persistently as it had filled up our
                     crosscuts. From Lovejoy's barn they could see that the track was now perfectly
                     clear for the half mile where it crossed the Prescott meadows.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry to have been so long in describing thus the aspect of the field
                     after the first engagement. But it was on this condition of affairs that, after
                     full conference, the enterprises of the night were determined. Whatever was to
                     be done was to be done by men. And after thorough regale on Mrs. Lovejoy's
                     green tea, and continual return to her constant relays of thin bacon gilded by
                     unnumbered eggs; after cutting and coming again upon unnumbered mince-pies,
                     which, I am sorry to say, did not in any point compare well with Huldah's,—each
                     man thrust many doughnuts into his outside pockets, drew on the long boots
                     again, and his buckskin gloves and mittens, and, unencumbered now by the care
                     of animals, started on the work of the evening. The sun was just taking his
                     last look at them from the western hills, where Reuben and John could see
                     Huldah's chimney smoking. The plan was, by taking a double hand-sled of
                     Lovejoy's, and by knocking together two or three more, jumper-fashion, to work
                     their way across the meadow to the railroad causeway, and establish a milk
                     dépôt there, where the line was not half a mile from Lovejoy's. By going and
                     coming often, following certain tracks well known to Lovejoy on the windward
                     side of walls and fences, these eight men felt quite sure that by midnight they
                     could place all their milk at the spot where the old farm crossing strikes the
                     railroad. Meanwhile, Silas Lovejoy, a boy of fourteen, was to put on a pair of
                     snow-shoes, go down to the station, state the case to old Dix, and get from him
                     a red lantern and permission to stop the first train where it swept out from
                     the Pitman cut upon the causeway. Old Dix had no more right to give this
                     permission than had the humblest street-sweeper in Ispahan, and this they all
                     knew. But the fact that Silas had asked for it would show a willingness on
                     their part to submit to authority, if authority there had been. This satisfied
                     the New England love of law, on the one hand. On the other hand, the train<pb
                        n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6578-00000075"/> would be stopped, and this satisfied
                     the New England determination to get the thing done any way. To give additional
                     force to Silas, John provided him with a note to Dix, and it was generally
                     agreed that if Dix wasn't ugly, he would give the red lantern and the
                     permission. Silas was then to work up the road and station himself as far
                     beyond the curve as he could, and stop the first down-train. He was to tell the
                     conductor where the men were waiting with the milk, was to come down to them on
                     the train, and his duty would be done. Lest Dix should be ugly, Silas was
                     provided with Lovejoy's only lantern, but he was directed not to show this at
                     the station until his interview was finished. Silas started cheerfully on his
                     snow-shoes; John and Lovejoy, at the same time, starting with the first
                     hand-sled of the cans. First of all into the sled, John put Huldah's well-known
                     can, a little shorter than the others, and with a different handle. "Whatever
                     else went to Boston," he said, "that can was bound to go through."</p>
                  <p>They established the basis of their pyramid, and met the three new jumpers with
                     their makers as they went back for more. This party enlarged the base of the
                     pyramid; and, as they worked, Silas passed them cheerfully with his red
                     lantern. Old Dix had not been ugly, had given the lantern and all the
                     permission he had to give, and had communicated some intelligence also. The
                     intelligence was, that an accumulated force of seven engines, with a large
                     working party, had left Groton Junction downward at three. Nothing had arrived
                     upward at Groton Junction; and, from Boston, Dix learned that nothing more
                     would leave there till early morning. No trains had arrived in Boston from any
                     quarter for twenty-four hours. So long the blockade had lasted already.</p>
                  <p>On this intelligence, it was clear that, with good luck, the down-train might
                     reach them at any moment. Still the men resolved to leave their milk, while
                     they went back for more, relying on Silas and the "large working party" to put
                     it on the cars, if the train chanced to pass before any of them returned. So
                     back they fared to Lovejoy's for their next relay, and met John and Reuben
                     working in successfully with their second. But no one need have hurried; for,
                     as trip after trip they built their pyramid of cans higher and higher, no
                     welcome whistle<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6578-00000076"/> broke the stillness
                     of the night, and by ten o'clock, when all these cans were in place by the
                     rail, the train had not yet come.</p>
                  <p>John and Reuben then proposed to go up into the cut, and to relieve poor Silas,
                     who had not been heard from since he swung along so cheerfully like an
                     "Excelsior" boy on his way up the Alps. But they had hardly started, when a
                     horn from the meadow recalled them, and, retracing their way, they met a
                     messenger who had come in to say that a fresh team from the Four Corners had
                     been reported at Lovejoy's, with a dozen or more men, who had succeeded in
                     bringing down nearly as far as Lovejoy's mowing-lot near a hundred more cans;
                     that it was quite possible in two or three hours more to bring this over
                     also,—and, although the first train was probably now close at hand, it was
                     clearly worth while to place this relief in readiness for a second. So poor
                     Silas was left for the moment to his loneliness, and Reuben and John returned
                     again upon their steps. They passed the house where they found Mrs. Lovejoy and
                     Mrs. Stacy at work in the shed, finishing off two more jumpers, and claiming
                     congratulation for their skill, and after a cup of tea again,—for no man
                     touched spirit that day nor that night,—they reported at the new station by the
                     mowing-lot.</p>
                  <p>And Silas Lovejoy—who had turned the corner into the Pitman cut, and so shut
                     himself out from sight of the station light, or his father's windows, or the
                     lanterns of the party at the pyramid of cans—Silas Lovejoy held his watch
                     there, hour by hour, with such courage as the sense of the advance gives boy or
                     man. He had not neglected to take the indispensable shovel as he came. In going
                     over the causeway he had slipped off the snow-shoes and hung them on his back.
                     Then there was heavy wading as he turned into the Pitman cut, knee deep, middle
                     deep, and he laid his snow-shoes on the snow and set the red lantern on them,
                     as he reconnoitred. Middle deep, neck deep, and he fell forward on his face
                     into the yielding mass. "This will not do, I must not fall like that often,"
                     said Silas to himself, as he gained his balance and threw himself backward
                     against the mass. Slowly he turned round, worked back to the lantern, worked
                     out to the causeway, and fastened on the shoes again. With their safer help he
                     easily skimmed up to Pitman's bridge, which he had<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000077"/> determined on for his station. He knew that
                     thence his lantern could be seen for a mile, and that yet there the train might
                     safely be stopped, so near was the open causeway which he had just traversed.
                     He had no fear of an up-train behind him.</p>
                  <p>So Silas walked back and forth, and sang, and spouted "pieces," and mused on
                     the future of his life, and spouted "pieces" again, and sang in the loneliness.
                     How the time passed, he did not know. No sound of clock, no baying of dog, no
                     plash of waterfall, broke that utter stillness. The wind, thank God, had at
                     last died away; and Silas paced his beat in a long oval he made for himself,
                     under and beyond the bridge, with no sound but his own voice when he chose to
                     raise it. He expected, as they all did, that every moment the whistle of the
                     train, as it swept into sight a mile or more away, would break the silence; so
                     he paced, and shouted, and sang.</p>
                  <p>"This is a man's duty," he said to himself: "they would not let me go with the
                     fifth regiment,—not as a drummer boy; but this is duty such as no drummer boy
                     of them all is doing. Company, march!" and he "stepped forward smartly" with
                     his left foot. "Really I am placed on guard here quite as much as if I were on
                     picket in Virginia." "Who goes there?" "Advance, friend, and give the
                     countersign." Not that any one did go there, or could go there; but the boy's
                     fancy was ready, and so he amused himself during the first hours. Then he began
                     to wonder whether they were hours, as they seemed, or whether this was all a
                     wretched illusion,—that the time passed slowly to him because he was nothing
                     but a boy, and did not know how to occupy his mind. So he resolutely said the
                     multiplication-table from the beginning to the end, and from the end to the
                     beginning,—first to himself, and again aloud, to make it slower. Then he tried
                     the ten commandments. "Thou shalt have none other Gods before me:" easy to say
                     that beneath those stars; and he said them again. No, it is no illusion. I must
                     have been here hours long! Then he began on Milton's hymn:— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l rend="ti-1">"It was the winter wild,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>"Winter wild, indeed," said Silas aloud; and, if he had only known it, at that
                     moment the sun<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6578-00000078"/> beneath his feet was
                     crossing the meridian, midnight had passed already, and Christmas day was born! <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>"Innocent, indeed," said poor Silas, still aloud, "much did he know of innocent
                     snow!" And vainly did he try to recall the other stanzas, as he paced back and
                     forth, round and round, and began now to wonder where his father and the others
                     were, and if they could have come to any misfortune. Surely, they could not
                     have forgotten that he was here. Would that train never come?</p>
                  <p>If he were not afraid of its coming at once, he would have run back to the
                     causeway to look for their lights,—and perhaps they had a fire. Why had he not
                     brought an axe for a fire? "That rail fence above would have served
                     perfectly,—nay, it is not five rods to a load of hickory we left the day before
                     Thanksgiving. Surely one of them might come up to me with an axe. But maybe
                     there is trouble below. They might have come with an axe—with an axe—with an
                     axe—with an—axe"—"I am going to sleep," cried Silas,—aloud again this time,—as
                     his head dropped heavily on the handle of the shovel he was resting on there in
                     the lee of the stone wall. "I am going to sleep,—that will never do. Sentinel
                     asleep at his post. Order out the relief. Blind his eyes. Kneel, sir. Make
                     ready. Fire. That, sir, for sentinels asleep." And so Silas laughed grimly, and
                     began his march again. Then he took his shovel and began a great pit where he
                     supposed the track might be beneath him. "Anything to keep warm and to keep
                     awake. But why did they not send up to him? Why was he here? Why was he all
                     alone? He who had never been alone before. Was he alone? Was there
                     companionship in the stars,—or in the good God who held the stars? Did the good
                     God put me here? If he put me here, will he keep me here? Or did he put me here
                     to die! To die in this cold? It is cold,—it is very cold! Is there any good in
                     my dying? The train will run down, and they will see a dead body lying under
                     the bridge,—black on the snow, with a red lantern by it. Then they will stop.
                     Shall I—I will—just go back to see if the lights are at the bend. I will leave
                     the lantern here on<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6578-00000079"/> the edge of this
                     wall!" And so Silas turned, half benumbed, worked his way nearly out of the
                     gorge, and started as he heard, or thought he heard, a baby's scream. "A
                     thousand babies are starving, and I am afraid to stay here to give them their
                     life," he said. "There is a boy fit for a soldier! Order out the relief!
                     Drumhead court-martial! Prisoner, hear your sentence! Deserter, to be shot!
                     Blindfold,—kneel, sir! Fire! Good enough for deserters!" And so poor Silas
                     worked back again to the lantern.</p>
                  <p>And now he saw and felt sure that Orion was bending downward, and he knew that
                     the night must be broken; and, with some new hope, throwing down the shovel
                     with which he had been working, he began his soldier tramp once more,—as far as
                     soldier tramp was possible with those trailing snow-shoes,—tried again on "No
                     war nor battle sound," broke down on "Cynthia's seat" and the "music of the
                     spheres;" but at last,—working on "beams," "long beams," and "that with long
                     beams,"—he caught the stanzas he was feeling for, and broke out exultant with,—<q>

                  <p>Come they had! The globe of circular light swept full over the valley, and the
                     scream of the engine was welcomed by the freezing boy as if it had been an
                     angel's whisper to him. Not unprepared did it find him. The red lantern swung
                     to and fro in a well-practised hand, and he was in waiting on his firmest spot
                     as the train <emph>slowed</emph> and the engine passed him.</p>
                  <p>"Do not stop for me," he cried, as he threw his weight heavily on the tender
                     side, and the workmen dragged him in. "Only run slow till you are out of the
                     ledge: we have made a milk station at the cross-road."</p>
                  <p>"Good for you!" said the wondering fireman, who in a moment understood the
                     exigency. The heavy plough threw out the snow steadily still, in ten seconds
                     they were clear of the ledge, and saw the fire-light shimmering on the great
                     pyramids of milk-cans. Slower and slower ran the<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000080"/> train, and by the blazing fire stopped, for
                     once, because its masters chose to stop. And the working party on the train
                     cheered lustily as they tumbled out of the cars, as they apprehended the
                     situation, and were cheered by the working party from the village.</p>
                  <p>Two or three cans of milk stood on the embers of the fire, that they might be
                     ready for the men on the train with something that was at least warm. An empty
                     passenger car was opened and the pyramids of milk-cans were hurried into
                     it,—forty men now assisting.</p>
                  <p>"You will find Joe Winter at the Boston station," said John Stevens to the
                     "gentlemanly conductor" of the express, whose lightning train had thus become a
                     milk convoy. "Tell Winter to distribute this among all the carts, that
                     everybody may have some. Good luck to you. Good-by!" And the engines snorted
                     again, and John Stevens turned back, not so much as thinking that he had made
                     his Christmas present to a starving town.</p>

                  <head type="sub">CHRISTMAS MORNING.</head>
                  <p>THE children were around Robert Walter's knees, and each of the two spelled out
                     a verse of the second chapter of Luke, on Christmas morning. And Robert and
                     Mary kneeled with them, and they said together, "Our Father who art in heaven."
                     Mary's voice broke a little when they came to "daily bread," but with the two,
                     and her husband, she continued to the end, and could say "thine is the power,"
                     and believe it too.</p>
                  <p>"Mamma," whispered little Fanny, as she kissed her mother after the prayer,
                     "when I said my prayer up stairs last night, I said 'our daily milk,' and so
                     did Robert." This was more than poor Mary could bear. She kissed the child, and
                     she hurried away.</p>
                  <p>For last night at six o'clock it was clear that the milk was sour, and little
                     Jamie had detected it first of all. Then, with every one of the old wiles, they
                     had gone back over the old slops; but the child, with that old weird strength,
                     had pushed them all away. Christmas morning<pb n="136-137"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000081"/> broke, and poor Robert, as soon as light would
                     serve, had gone to the neighbors all,—their nearest intimates they had tried
                     the night before,—and from all had brought back the same reply; one friend had
                     sent a wretched sample, but the boy detected the taint and pushed it, untasted,
                     away. Dr. Morton had the alarm the day before. He was at the house earlier than
                     usual with some condensed milk, which his wife's stores had furnished; but that
                     would not answer. Poor Jamie pushed this by. There was some smoke or
                     something,—who should say what?—it would not do. The doctor could see in an
                     instant how his patient had fallen back in the night. That weird, anxious,
                     entreating look, as his head lay back on the little pillow, had all come back
                     again. Robert and Robert's friends, Gaisford and Warren, had gone down to the
                     Old Colony, to the Worcester, and to the Hartford stations. Perhaps their
                     trains were doing better. The door-bell rang yet again. "Mrs. Appleton's love
                     to Mrs. Walter, and perhaps her child will try some fresh beef-tea." As if poor
                     Jamie did not hate beef-tea; still Morton resolutely forced three spoonfuls
                     down. Half an hour more and Mrs. Dudley's compliments. "Mrs. Dudley heard that
                     Mrs. Walter was out of milk, and took the liberty to send round some very
                     particularly nice Scotch groats, which her brother had just brought from
                     Edinburgh." "Do your best with it, Fanny," said poor Mary, but she knew that if
                     Jamie took those Scotch groats it was only because they were a Christmas
                     present. Half an hour more! Three more spoonfuls of beef-tea after a fight.
                     Door-bell again. Carriage at the door. "Would Mrs. Walter come down and see
                     Mrs. Fitch? It was really very particular." Mary was half dazed, and went down,
                     she did not know why.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Mrs. Walter, you do not remember me," said this eager girl, crossing the
                     room and taking her by both hands.</p>
                  <p>"Why, no—yes—do I?" said Mary, crying and laughing together.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, you will remember, it was at church, at the baptism. My Jennie and your
                     Jamie were christened the same day. And now I hear,—we all know how low he
                     is,—and perhaps he will share my Jennie's breakfast. Dear Mrs. Walter, do let
                     me try."</p>
                  <p>Then Mary saw that the little woman's cloak and hat were already thrown
                     off,—which had<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6578-00000082"/> not seemed strange to
                     her before,—and the two passed quietly up stairs together; and Julia Fitch bent
                     gently over him, and cooed to him, and smiled to him, but could not make the
                     poor child smile. And they lifted him so gently on the pillow,—but only to hear
                     him scream. And she brought his head gently to her heart, and drew back the
                     little curtain that was left, and offered to him her life; but he was
                     frightened, and did not know her, and had forgotten what it was she gave him,
                     and screamed again; and so they had to lay him back gently upon the pillow. And
                     then,—as Julia was saying she would stay, and how they could try again, and
                     could do this and that,—then the door-bell rang again, and Mrs. Coleman had
                     herself come round with a little white pitcher, and herself ran up stairs with
                     it, and herself knocked at the door!</p>
                  <p>The blockade was broken, and</p>
                  <p>THE MILK HAD COME!</p>

                  <p>Mary never knew that it was from Huldah Stevens's milk-can that her boy drank
                     in the first drop of his new life. Nor did Huldah know it. Nor did John know
                     it, nor the paladins who fought that day at his side. Nor did Silas Love-joy

                  <p>But the good God and all good angels knew it. Why ask for more?</p>

                  <p>This was the cry of little Herbert as he ran in from the square stone which
                     made the large doorstep of the house. Here he had been watching, a self-posted
                     sentinel, for the moment when the carriage should turn the corner at the bottom
                     of the hill.</p>
                  <p>"They 've come! they 've come!" echoed joyfully through the house; and the cry
                     penetrated out into the extension, or ell, in which the grown members of the
                     family were, in the kitchen, "getting tea" by some formulas more solemn than
                     ordinary.</p>
                  <p>"Have they come?" cried Grace; and she set her skillet back to the
                     quarter-deck, or after-part of the stove, lest its white contents should burn
                     while she was away. She threw a waiting handkerchief over her shoulders, and
                     ran with the others to the front door, to wave something white, and to be in at
                     the first welcome.</p>
                  <p>Young and old were gathered there in that hospitable open space where the side
                     road swept up to the barn on its way from the main road. The bigger boys of the
                     home party had scattered half-way down the hill by this time. Even grandmamma
                     had stepped down from the stone, and walked half-way to the roadway. Every one
                     was waving something. Those who had no handkerchiefs had hats or towels to
                     wave; and the more advanced boys began an undefined or irregular cheer.</p>
                  <p>But the carryall advanced slowly up the hill, with no answering handkerchief,
                     and no bonneted head stretched out from the side. And, as it neared Sam and
                     Andrew, their enthusiasm could be seen to droop, and George and Herbert stopped
                     their cheers as it came up to them; and before it was near the house, on its
                     grieved way up the hill, the bad news had come up before it, as bad news
                     will,—"She has not come, after all."</p>
                  <p>It was Huldah Root, Grace's older sister, who<pb n="142-143"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000084"/> had not come. John Root, their father, had
                     himself driven down to the station to meet her; and Abner, her oldest brother,
                     had gone with him. It was two years since she had been at home, and the whole
                     family was on tiptoe to welcome her. Hence the unusual tea preparation; hence
                     the sentinel on the doorstep; hence the general assembly in the yard; and,
                     after all, she had not come! It was a wretched disappointment. Her mother had
                     that heavy, silent look, which children take as the heaviest affliction of all,
                     when they see it in their mother's faces. John Root himself led the horse into
                     the barn, as if he did not care now for anything which might happen in heaven
                     above or in earth beneath. The boys were voluble in their rage: "It is too
                     bad!" and, "Grandmamma, don't you think it is too bad?" and, "It is the meanest
                     thing I ever heard of in all my life!" and, "Grace, why don't you say anything?
                     did you ever know anything so mean?" As for poor Grace herself, she was quite
                     beyond saying anything. All the treasured words she had laid up to say to
                     Huldah; all the doubts and hopes and guesses, which were secret to all but God,
                     but which were to be poured out in Huldah's ear as soon as they were alone,
                     were coming up one by one, as if to choke her. She had waited so long for this
                     blessed fortnight of sympathy, and now she had lost it. Grace could say
                     nothing. And poor grandmamma, on whom fell the stilling of the boys, was at
                     heart as wretched as any of them.</p>
                  <p>Somehow, something got itself put on the supper-table; and, when John Root and
                     Abner came in from the barn, they all sat down to pretend to eat something.
                     What a miserable contrast to the Christmas eve party which had been
                     expected!</p>
                  <p>The observance of Christmas is quite a novelty in the heart of New England
                     among the lords of the manor. Winslow and Brewster, above Plymouth Rock,
                     celebrated their first Christmas by making all hands work all day in the
                     raising of their first house. It was in that way that a Christian empire was
                     begun. They builded better than they knew. They and theirs, in that hard day's
                     work, struck the key-note for New England for two centuries and a half. And
                     many and many a New Englander, still in middle life, remembers that in
                     childhood, though nurtured in Christian homes, he could not have<pb n="144-145"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000085"/> told, if he were asked, on what day of the year
                     Christmas fell. But as New England, in the advance of the world, has come into
                     the general life of the world, she has shown no inaptitude for the greater
                     enjoyments of life; and, with the true catholicity of her great Congregational
                     system, her people and her churches seize, one after another, all the noble
                     traditions of the loftiest memories. And so in this matter we have in hand; it
                     happened that the Roots, in their hillside home, had determined that they would
                     celebrate Christmas, as never had Roots done before since Josiah Root landed at
                     Salem, from the "Hercules," with other Kentish people, in 1635. Abner and
                     Gershom had cut and trimmed a pretty fir-balsam from the edge of the Hotchkiss
                     clearing; and it was now in the best parlor. Grace, with Mary Bickford, her
                     firm ally and other self, had gilded nuts, and rubbed lady apples, and strung
                     popped corn; and the tree had been dressed in secret, the youngsters all locked
                     and warned out from the room. The choicest turkeys of the drove, and the
                     tenderest geese from the herd, and the plumpest fowls from the barnyard, had
                     been sacrificed on consecrated altars. And all this was but as accompaniment
                     paniment and side illustration of the great glory of the celebration, which
                     was, that Huldah, after her two years' absence,—Huldah was to come home.</p>
                  <p>And now she had not come,—nay, was not coming!</p>
                  <p>As they sat down at their Barmecide feast, how wretched the assemblage of
                     unrivalled dainties seemed! John Root handed to his wife their daughter's
                     letter; she read it, and gave it to Grace, who read it, and gave it to her
                     grandmother. No one read it aloud. To read aloud in such trials is not the
                     custom of New England.</p>

                              <p>DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,—It is dreadful to disappoint you all, but I
                                 cannot come. I am all ready, and this goes by the carriage that was
                                 to take me to the cars. But our dear little Horace has just been
                                 brought home, I am afraid, dying; but we cannot tell, and I cannot
                                 leave him. You know there is really no one who can do what I can.
                                 He was riding on his pony. First the pony came home alone; and, in
                                 five minutes after, two policemen brought the dear child in a
                                 carriage. His poor mother is very<pb n="146-147"
                                    xml:id="VAC6578-00000086"/> calm, but cannot think yet, or do
                                 anything. We have sent for his father, who is down town. I try to
                                 hope that he may come to himself; but he only lies and draws long
                                 breaths on his little bed. The doctors are with him now; and I
                                 write this little scrawl to say how dreadfully sorry I am. A merry
                                 Christmas to you all. Do not be troubled about me.</p>

                  <p>This was the letter that was passed from hand to hand, of which the contents
                     slowly trickled into the comprehension of all parties, according as their
                     several ages permitted them to comprehend. Sam, as usual, broke the silence by
                     saying,—</p>
                  <p>"It is a perfect shame! She might as well be a nigger slave! I suppose they
                     think they have bought her and sold her. I should like to see 'em all, just for
                     once, and tell 'em that her flesh and blood is as good as theirs; and that,
                     with all their airs and their money, they 've no business to"—</p>
                  <p>"Sam," said poor Grace, "you shall not say such things. Huldah has stayed
                     because she chose to stay; and that is the worst of it. She will not think of
                     herself, not for one minute; and so—everything happens."</p>
                  <p>And Grace was sobbing beyond speech again; and her intervention amounted,
                     therefore, to little or nothing. The boys, through the evening, descanted among
                     themselves on the outrage. Grandmamma, and at last their mother, took
                     successive turns in taming their indignation; but, for all this, it was a
                     miserable evening. As for John Root, he took a lamp in one hand, and "The
                     Weekly Tribune" in the other, and sat before the fire, and pretended to read;
                     but not once did John Root change the fold of the paper that evening. It was a
                     wretched Christmas eve; and, at half-past eight, every light was out, and every
                     member of the household was lying stark awake, in bed.</p>
                  <p>Huldah Root, you see, was a servant with the Bartletts, in Boston. When she was
                        only<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6578-00000087"/> sixteen, she was engaged at
                     her "trade," as a vest-maker, in that town; and, by some chance, made an
                     appointment to sew as a seamstress at Mrs. Bartlett's for a fortnight. There
                     were any number of children to be clothed there; and the fortnight extended to
                     a month. Then the month became two months. She grew fond of Mrs. Bartlett,
                     because Mrs. Bartlett grew fond of her. The children adored her; and she kept
                     an eye to them; and it ended in her engaging to spend the winter there,
                     half-seamstress, half-nurse, half-nursery-governess, and a little of
                     everything. From such a beginning, it had happened that she had lived there six
                     years, in confidential service. She could cook better than anybody in the
                     house,—better than Mrs. Bartlett herself; but it was not often that she tried
                     her talent there. On a birthday perhaps, in August, she would make huckleberry
                     cakes, by the old homestead "receipt," for the children. She had the run of all
                     their clothes as nobody else did; took the younger ones to be measured; and saw
                     that none of the older ones went out with a crack in a seam, or a rough edge at
                     the foot of a trowser. It was whispered that Minnie had rather go into the
                     sewing-room to get Huldah dah to "show her" about "alligation" or
                     "square-root," than to wait for Miss Thurber's explanations in the morning. In
                     fifty such ways, it happened that Huldah—who, on the roll-call of the
                     census-man, probably rated as a nursery-maid in the house—was the confidential
                     friend of every member of the family, from Mr. Bartlett, who wanted to know
                     where "The Intelligencer" was, down to the chore-boy who came in to black the
                     shoes. And so it was, that, when poor little Horace was brought in with his
                     skull knocked in by the pony, Huldah was—and modestly knew that she was—the
                     most essential person in the stunned family circle.</p>
                  <p>While her brothers and sisters were putting out their lights at New Durham,
                     heart-sick and wounded, Huldah was sitting in that still room, where only the
                     rough broken breathing of poor Horace broke the sound. She was changing, once
                     in ten minutes, the ice-water cloths; was feeling of his feet sometimes;
                     wetting his tongue once or twice in an hour; putting her finger to his pulse
                     with a native sense, which needed no second-hand to help it; and all the time,
                     with the thought of him, was remembering how grieved and hurt and heart-broken
                     they were<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6578-00000088"/> at home. Every half-hour
                     or less, a pale face appeared at the door; and Huldah just slid across the
                     room, and said, "He is really doing nicely, pray lie down;" or, "His pulse is
                     surely better, I will certainly come to you if it flags;" or "Pray trust me, I
                     will not let you wait a moment if he needs you;" or, "Pray get ready for
                     to-morrow. An hour's sleep now will be worth everything to you then." And the
                     poor mother would crawl back to her baby and her bed, and pretend to try to
                     sleep; and in half an hour would appear again at the door. One o'clock, two
                     o'clock, three o'clock. How companionable Dr. Lowell's clock seems when one is
                     sitting up so, with no one else to talk to! Four o'clock at last; it is really
                     growing to be quite intimate. Five o'clock. "If I were in dear Durham now, one
                     of the roosters would be calling,"—Six o'clock. Poor Horace stirs, turns,
                     flings his arm over. "Mother—O Huldah! is it you? How nice that is!" And he is
                     unconscious again; but he had had sense enough to know her. What a blessed
                     Christmas present that is, to tell that to his poor mother when she slides in
                     at daybreak, and says, "You shall go to bed now, dear child. You see I am very
                     fresh; and you must rest yourself, you know. Do you really say he knew you? Are
                     you sure he knew you? Why, Huldah, what an angel of peace you are!"</p>
                  <p>So opened Huldah's Christmas morning.</p>
                  <p>Days of doubt, nights of watching. Every now and then the boy knows his mother,
                     his father, or Huldah. Then will come this heavy stupor which is so different
                     from sleep. At last the surgeons have determined that a piece of the bone must
                     come away. There is the quiet gathering of the most skilful at the determined
                     hour; there is the firm table for the little fellow to lie on; here is the
                     ether and the sponge; and, of course, here and there, and everywhere, is
                     Huldah. She can hold the sponge, or she can fetch and carry; she can answer at
                     once if she is spoken to; she can wait, if it is waiting; she can act, if it is
                     acting. At last the wretched little button, which has been pressing on our poor
                     boy's brain, is lifted safely out. It is in Morton's hand; he smiles and nods
                     at Huldah as she looks inquiry, and she knows he is satisfied. And does not the
                     poor child himself, even in his unconscious sleep, draw his<pb n="152-153"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000089"/> breath more lightly than he did before? All is
                     well.</p>
                  <p>"Who do you say that young woman is?" says Dr. Morton to Mr. Bartlett, as he
                     draws on his coat in the doorway after all is over. "Could we not tempt her
                     over to the General Hospital?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I think not. I do not think we can spare her."</p>
                  <p>The boy Horace is new-born that day; a New Year's gift to his mother. So pass
                     Huldah's holidays.</p>

                     to any prank of any pony. Fourteen years will do this, even to boys of ten.
                     Horace Bartlett is the colonel of a cavalry regiment, stationed just now in
                     West Virginia; and, as it happens, this twenty-four-year-old boy has an older
                     commission than anybody in that region, and is the Post Commander at Talbot C.
                     H., and will be, most likely, for the winter. The boy has a vein of foresight
                     in him; a good deal of system; and, what is worth while to have by the side of
                     system, some knack of order. So soon as he finds that he is responsible, he
                     begins to prepare for responsibility. His staff-officers are boys too; but they
                     are all friends, and all mean to do their best. His Surgeon-in-Charge took his
                     degree at Washington last spring; that is encouraging. Perhaps, if he has not
                     much experience, he has, at least, the latest advices. His head is level too;
                     he means to do his best, such as it is; and, indeed, all hands in that knot of
                     boy counsellors will not fail for laziness or carelessness. Their very youth
                     makes them provident and grave.</p>

                              <p>DEAR HULDAH,—Here we are still, as I have been explaining to
                                 father; and, as you will see by my letter to him, here we are like
                                 to stay. Thus far we are doing sufficiently well. As I have told
                                 him, if my plans had been adopted we should have been pushed
                                 rapidly forward up the<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6578-00000090"/>
                                 valley of the Yellow Creek; Badger's corps would have been
                                 withdrawn from before Winchester; Wilcox and Steele together would
                                 have threatened Early; and then, by a rapid flank movement, we
                                 should have pounced down on Longstreet (not the great Longstreet,
                                 but little Longstreet), and compelled him to uncover Lynchburg; we
                                 could have blown up the dams and locks on the canal, made a freshet
                                 to sweep all the obstructions out of James River, and then, if they
                                 had shown half as much spirit on the Potomac, all of us would be in
                                 Richmond for our Christmas dinner. But my plans, as usual, were not
                                 asked for, far less taken. So, as I said, here we are.</p>
                              <p>Well, I have been talking with Lawrence Worster, my
                                 Surgeon-in-Charge, who is a very good fellow. His sick-list is not
                                 bad now, and he does not mean to have it bad; but he says that he
                                 is not pleased with the ways of his ward-masters; and it was his
                                 suggestion, not mine, mark you, that I should see if one or two of
                                 the Sanitary women would not come as far as this to make things
                                 decent. So, of course, I write to you. Don't you think mother could
                                 spare you to spend the winter here? It will be rough, of course;
                                 but it is all in the good cause. Perhaps you know some nice
                                 women,—well, not like you, of course; but still, disinterested and
                                 sensible, who would come too. Think of this carefully, I beg you,
                                 and talk to father and mother. Worster says we may have three
                                 hundred boys in hospital before Christmas. If Jubal Early should
                                 come this way, I don't know how many more. Talk with mother and
                                 father.</p>

                                 of official letter which may be of use. He says, "Show this to Dr.
                                 Hayward; get them to examine you and the others, and then the
                                 government, on his order, will pass you on." I enclose this,

                  <p>Of course Huldah went. Grace Starr, her married sister, went with her, and Mrs.
                     Philbrick, and Anna Thwart. That was the way they happened to be all together
                     in the Methodist Church that had been, of Talbot Court House, as Christmas
                     holidays drew near, of the year of grace, 1863.</p>
                  <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6578-00000091"/>
                  <p>She and her friends had been there quite long enough to be wonted to the
                     strangeness of December in the open air. On her little table in front of the
                     desk of the church were three or four buttercups in bloom, which she had
                     gathered in an afternoon walk, with three or four heads of hawksweed. "The
                     beginning of one year," Huldah said, "with the end of the other." Nay, there
                     was even a stray rose which Dr. Sprigg had found in a farmer's garden. Huldah
                     came out from the vestry, where her own bed was, in the gray of the morning,
                     changed the water for the poor little flowers, sat a moment at the table to
                     look at last night's memoranda, and then beckoned to the ward-master, and asked
                     him, in a whisper, what was the movement she had heard in the night,—"Another
                     alarm from Early?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Miss; not an alarm. I saw the Colonel's orderly as he passed. He stopped
                     here for Dr. Fenno's case. There had come down an express from General
                     Mitchell, and the men were called without the bugle, each man separately; not a
                     horse was to neigh, if they could help it. And really, Miss, they were off in
                     twenty minutes."</p>
                  <p>"Off, who are off?"</p>
                  <p>"The whole post, Miss, except the relief for to-day. There are not fifty men in
                     the village besides us here. The orderly thought they were to go down to
                     Braxton's; but he did not know."</p>
                  <p>Here was news indeed! news so exciting that Huldah went back at once, and
                     called the other women; and then all of them together began on that wretched
                     business of waiting. They had never yet known what it was to wait for a real
                     battle. They had had their beds filled with this and that patient from one or
                     another post, and had some gun-shot wounds of old standing among the rest; but
                     this was their first battle if it were a battle. So the covers were taken off
                     that long line of beds, down on the west aisle, and from those under the
                     singers' seat; and the sheets and pillow-cases were brought out from the linen
                     room, and aired, and put on. Our biggest kettles are filled up with strong
                     soup; and we have our milk-punch, and our beef-tea all in readiness; and
                     everybody we can command is on hand to help lift patients and distribute food.
                     But there is only too much time. Will there never be any news? Anna Thwart and
                     Doctor Sprigg have walked down to the<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6578-00000092"
                     /> bend of the hill, to see if any messenger is coming. As for the other women,
                     they sit at their table; they look at their watches; they walk down to the
                     door; they come back to the table. I notice they have all put on fresh aprons,
                     for the sake of doing something more in getting ready.</p>
                  <p>Here is Anna Thwart. "They are coming! they are coming! somebody is coming. A
                     mounted man is crossing the flat, coming towards us; and the doctor told me to
                     come back and tell." Five minutes more, ten minutes more, an eternity more, and
                     then, rat-tat-tat, rat-tat-tat, the mounted man is here. "Wagons right behind.
                     We bagged every man of them at Wyatt's. Got there before daylight. Colonel
                     White's men from the Yellows came up just at the same time, and we pitched in
                     before they knew it,—three or four regiments, <choice>

                        <corr>thirteen</corr>
                     </choice> hundred men, and all their guns."</p>
                  <p>"And with no fighting?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! fighting of course. The colonel has got a train of wagons down here
                     with the men that are hurt. That's why I am here. Here is his note." Thus does
                     the mounted man discharge his errand backward.</p>

                              <p>DEAR DOCTOR,—We have had great success. We have surprised the whole
                                 post. The company across the brook tried hard to get away; and a
                                 good many of them, and of Sykes's men, are hit; but I cannot find
                                 that we have lost more than seven men. I have nineteen wagons here
                                 of wounded men,—some hurt pretty badly.</p>

                  <p>So there must be more waiting. But now we know what we are waiting for; and the
                     end will come in a finite world. Thank God, at half-past three, here they are!
                     Tenderly, gently. "Hush, Sam! Hush, Cæsar! You talk too much." Gently,
                     tenderly. Twenty-seven of the poor fellows, with everything the matter, from a
                     burnt face to a heart stopping its beats for want of more blood.</p>
                  <p>"Huldah, come here. This is my old classmate, Barthow; sat next me at prayers
                     four years. He is a major in their army, you see. His horse stumbled, and
                     pitched him against a stone wall; and he has not spoken since. Don't tell me he
                     is dying; but do as well for him, Huldah,"—and the handsome boy smiled,—"do as
                     well for him as you did for me." So<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6578-00000093"/>
                     they carried Barthow, senseless as he was, tenderly into the church; and he
                     became E, 27, on an iron bedstead. Not half our soup was wanted, nor our
                     beef-tea, nor our punch. So much the better.</p>
                  <p>Then came day and night, week in and out, of army system, and womanly
                     sensibility; that quiet, cheerful, <emph>homish,</emph> hospital life, in the
                     quaint surroundings of the white-washed church; the pointed arches of the
                     windows and the faded moreen of the pulpit telling that it is a church, in a
                     reminder not unpleasant. Two or three weeks of hopes and fears, failures and
                     success, bring us to Christmas eve.</p>
                  <p>It is the surgeon-in-chief, who happens to give our particular Christmas
                     dinner,—I mean the one that interests you and me. Huldah and the other ladies
                     had accepted his invitation. Horace Bartlett and his staff, and some of the
                     other officers, were guests; and the doctor had given his own permit that Major
                     Barthow might walk up to his quarters with the ladies. Huldah and he were in
                     advance, he leaning, with many apologies, on her arm. Dr. Sprigg and Anna
                     Thwart were far behind. The two married ried ladies, as needing no escort, were
                     in the middle. Major Barthow enjoyed the emancipation, was delighted with his
                     companion, could not say enough to make her praise the glimpses of Virginia,
                     even if it were West Virginia.</p>
                  <p>"What a party it is, to be sure!" said he. "The doctor might call on us for our
                     stories, as one of Dickens's chiefs would do at a Christmas feast. Let's see,

                  </p>
                  <p>Barthow spoke with real feeling, which he<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000094"/> did not care to disguise. But Huldah was not
                     there for sentiment; and without quivering in the least, nor making other
                     acknowledgment, she laughed as she knew she ought to do, and said, "Oh, no!
                     that is quite too grand, the story must end with <list>

                  <p>"I don't see," persisted the major, "if Superintendent of Special Relief means
                     Saint in Latin, why we should not say so."</p>
                  <p>"Because we are not talking Latin," said Huldah. "Listen to me; and, before we
                     come to dinner, I will tell you a story pretty enough for Dickens, or any of
                     them; and it is a story not fifteen minutes old.</p>

                     and asked if there were nothing we could do to make him more at home. Oh, no!
                     there was nothing; madame was too good, and everybody was too good, and so on.
                     But I persisted. I wished I knew more about Christmas in France; and I staid
                     by. 'No, madame, nothing; there is nothing. But, since you say it,—if there
                     were two drops of red wine,—<foreign xml:lang="FRA">du vin de mon pays,
                        madame;</foreign> but you could not here in Virginia.' Could not I? A
                     superintendent of special relief has long arms. There was a box of claret,
                     which was the first thing I saw in the store-room the day I took my keys. The
                     doctor was only too glad the man had thought of it; and you should have seen
                     the pleasure that red glass, as full as I could pile it, gave him. The tears
                     were running down his cheeks. Anna, there, had another Frenchman; and she sent
                     some to him: and my man is now humming a little song about the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">vin rouge</foreign> of Bourgogne. Would not Mr. Dickens make
                     a pretty story of that for you,—'THE FRENCHMAN'S STORY'?"</p>
                  <p>Barthow longed to say that the great novelist would not make so pretty a story
                     as she did. But this time he did not dare.</p>
                  <p>You are not going to hear the eight stories. Mr. Dickens was not there; nor,
                     indeed, was I.<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6578-00000095"/> But a jolly Christmas
                     dinner they had; though they had not those eight stories. Quiet they were, and
                     very, very happy. It was a strange thing,—if one could have analyzed it,—that
                     they should have felt so much at home, and so much at ease with each other, in
                     that queer Virginian kitchen, where the doctor and his friends of his mess had
                     arranged the feast. It was a happy thing, that the recollections of so many
                     other Christmas homes should come in, not sadly, but pleasantly, and should
                     cheer, rather than shade the evening. They felt off soundings, all of them.
                     There was, for the time, no responsibility. The strain was gone. The gentlemen
                     were glad to be dining with ladies, I believe: the ladies, unconsciously, were
                     probably glad to be dining with gentlemen. The officers were glad they were not
                     on duty; and the prisoner, if glad of nothing else, was glad he was not in bed.
                     But he was glad for many things beside. You see it was but a little post. They
                     were far away; and they took things with the ease of a detached command.</p>
                  <p>"Shall we have any toasts?" said the doctor, when his nuts and raisins and
                     apples at last appeared.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! no toasts,—nothing so stiff as that."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! oh, yes!" said Grace. "I should like to know what it is to drink a
                     toast. Something I have heard of all my life, and never saw."</p>
                  <p>"One toast, at least, then," said the doctor. "Colonel Bartlett, will you name
                     the toast?"</p>
                  <p>"Only one toast?" said Horace; "that is a hard selection: we must vote on
                     that."</p>
                  <p>"No, no!" said a dozen voices; and a dozen laughing assistants at the feast
                     offered their advice.</p>
                  <p>"I might give 'The Country;' I might give 'The Cause;' I might give 'The
                     President:' and everybody would drink," said Horace. "I might give 'Absent
                     friends,' or 'Home, sweet home;' but then we should cry."</p>
                  <p>"Why do you not give 'The trepanned people'?" said Worster, laughing, "or 'The
                     silver-headed gentlemen'?"</p>
                  <p>"Why don't you give 'The Staff and the Line'?" "Why don't you give 'Here's
                     Hoping'?" "Give 'Next Christmas.'" "Give 'The Medical Department; and may they
                     often ask us to dine!'"</p>
                  <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6578-00000096"/>
                  <p>"Give 'Saints and Sinners,'" said Major Barthow, after the first outcry was
                     hushed.</p>
                  <p>"I shall give no such thing," said Horace. "We have had a lovely dinner; and we
                     know we have; and the host, who is a good fellow, knows the first thanks are
                     not to him. Those of us who ever had our heads knocked open, like the Major and
                     me, do know. Fill your glasses, gentlemen; I give you 'the Special Diet
                     Kitchen.'"</p>
                  <p>He took them all by surprise. There was a general shout; and the ladies all
                     rose, and dropped mock courtesies.</p>
                  <p>"By Jove!" said Barthow to the Colonel, afterwards, "It was the best toast I
                     ever drank in my life. Anyway, that little woman has saved my life. Do you say
                     she did the same to you?"</p>

                  <p>SO you think that when the war was over Major Barthow, then Major-General,
                     remembered Huldah all the same, and came on and persuaded her to marry him, and
                     that she is now sitting in her veranda, looking down on the Pamunkey River. You
                     think that, do not you?</p>
                  <p>Well! you were never so mistaken in your life. If you want that story, you can
                     go and buy yourself a dime novel. I would buy "The Rescued Rebel;" or, "The
                     Noble Nurse," if I were you.</p>
                  <p>After the war was over, Huldah did make Colonel Barthow and his wife a visit
                     once, at their plantation in Pocataligo County; but I was not there, and know
                     nothing about it.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Christmas of hers, about which she wrote a letter; and, as it

                     <p>Here I was, then, after this series of hopeless blunders, sole alone at the
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gare</foreign> [French for station] of this
                        little out-of-the-way town. My dear, there was never an American here since
                        Christopher Columbus slept here when he was a boy. And here, you see, I was
                        like to remain; for there was no possibility of the others getting back to
                        me till to-morrow, and no good in my trying to overtake them. All I<pb
                           n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6578-00000097"/> could do was just to bear it, and
                        live on, and live through from Thursday to Monday; and, really, what was
                        worst of all was that Friday was Christmas day.</p>
                     <p>Well, I found a funny little carriage, with a funny old man who did not
                        understand my <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois</foreign> any better than I did
                        his; but he understood a franc-piece. I had my guide-book, and I said
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">auberge;</foreign> and we came to the oddest,
                        most outlandish, and old-fashioned establishment that ever escaped from one
                        of Julia Nathalie woman's novels. And here I am.</p>
                     <p>And the reason, my dear Mrs. Barthow, that I take to-day to write to you,
                        you and the Colonel will now understand. You see it was only ten o'clock
                        when I got here; then I went to walk, many <foreign xml:lang="FRA">enfans
                           terribles</foreign> following respectfully; then I came home, and ate the
                        funny refection; then I got a nap; then I went to walk again, and made a
                        little sketch in the churchyard: and this time, one of the children brought
                        up her mother, a funny Norman woman, in a delicious costume,—I have a sketch
                        of another just like her,—and she dropped a courtesy, and in a very mild
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">patois</foreign> said she hoped the children did
                        not trouble madame. And I said, "Oh, no!" and found a sugar-plum for the
                        child and showed my sketch to the woman; and she said she supposed madame
                        was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Anglaise.</foreign>
                     </p>
                     <p>I said I was not <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Anglaise,</foreign>—and here the
                        story begins; for I said I was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Americaine.</foreign>
                        And, do you know, her face lighted up as if I had said I was St. Gulda, or
                        St. Hilda, or any of their Northmen Saints.</p>
                     <p>"Americaine! est-il possible? Jeannette, Gertrude, faites vos révérences.
                        Madame est Americaine."</p>
                     <p>And, sure enough, they all dropped preternatural courtesies. And then the
                        most eager enthusiasm; how fond they all were of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les
                           Americaines,</foreign> but how no <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >Americaines</foreign> had ever come before! And was madame at the Three
                        Cygnets? And might she and her son and her husband call to see madame at the
                        Three Cygnets? And might she bring a little <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >étrenne</foreign> to madame? And I know not what beside.</p>
                     <p>I was very glad the national reputation had gone so far. I really wished I
                        were Charles Sumner (pardon me, dear Agnes), that I might properly receive
                        the delegation. But I said, "Oh, certainly!" and, as it grew dark, with
                           my<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6578-00000098"/> admiring <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">cortége</foreign> whispering now to the street full of
                        admirers that madame was <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Americaine,</foreign> I
                        returned to the Three Cygnets.</p>
                     <p>And in the evening they all came. Really, you should see the pretty basket
                        they brought for an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">étrenne.</foreign> I could not
                        guess then where they got such exquisite flowers; these lovely stephanotis
                        blossoms, a perfect wealth of roses, and all arranged with charming taste in
                        a quaint country basket, such as exists nowhere but in this particular
                        section of this quaint old Normandy. In came the husband, dressed up, and
                        frightened, but thoroughly good in his look. In came my friend; and then two
                        sons and two wives, and three or four children: and, my dear Agnes, one of
                        the sons, I knew him in an instant, was a man we had at Talbot Court House
                        when your husband was there. I think the Colonel will remember him,—a
                        black-whiskered man, who used to sing a little song about <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">le vin rouge</foreign> of Bourgogne.</p>
                     <p>He did not remember me; that I saw in a moment. It was all so different, you
                        know. In the hospital, I had on my cap and apron, and here,—well, it was
                        another thing. My hostess knew that they were coming, and had me in her
                        largest room, and I succeeded in making them all sit down; and I received my
                        formal welcome; and I thanked in my most Parisian French; and then the
                        conversation hung fire. But I took my turn now, and turned round to poor
                        Louis.</p>
                     <p>"You served in America, did you not?" said I.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, yes, madame! I did not know my mother had told you."</p>
                     <p>No more did she, indeed; and she looked astonished. But I persevered,—</p>
                     <p>"You seem strong and well."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, yes, madame!"</p>
                     <p>"How long since you returned?"</p>
                     <p>"As soon as there was peace, madame. We were mustered out in June,
                        madame."</p>
                     <p>"And does your arm never trouble you?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, never, madame! I did not know my mother had told you."</p>
                     <p>New astonishment on the part of the mother.</p>
                     <p>"You never had another piece of bone come out?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, no, madame! how did madame know? I did not know my mother had told
                        you!"</p>
                     <p>And by this time I could not help saying,<pb n="172-173"
                           xml:id="VAC6578-00000099"/> "You Normans care more for Christmas than we
                        Americans; is it not so, my brave?"</p>
                     <p>And this he would not stand; and he said stoutly, "Ah, no, madame! no, no,
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">jamais!</foreign>" and began an eager defence of
                        the religious enthusiasm of the Americans, and their goodness to all people
                        who were good, if people would only be good. But still he had not the least
                        dream who I was. And I said,—</p>
                     <p>"Do the Normans ever drink Burgundy?" and to my old hostess, "Madame, could
                        you bring us a flask <foreign xml:lang="FRA">du vin rouge de
                           Bourgogne?</foreign>" and then I hummed his little <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">chanson,</foreign> I am sure Colonel Barthow will remember
                           it,—"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Deux—gouttes—du vin rouge du

                     <p>My dear Mrs. Barthow, he sprang from his chair, and fell on his knees, and
                        kissed my hands, before I could stop him. And when his mother and father,
                        and all the rest, found that I was the particular <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >sœur de la charité</foreign> who had had the care of dear Louis when he
                        was hurt, and that it was I he had told of that very day,—for the thousandth
                        time, I believe,—who gave him that glass of claret, and cheered up his
                        Christmas, I verily believe they would have taken me to the church to
                        worship me. They were not satisfied,—the women with kissing me, or the men
                        with shaking hands with each other,—the whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >auberge</foreign> had to be called in; and poor I was famous. I need not
                        say I cried my eyes out; and when, at ten o'clock, they let me go to bed, I
                        was worn out with crying, and laughing, and talking, and listening; and I
                        believe they were as much upset as I.</p>
                     <p>Now that is just the beginning; and yet I see I must stop. But, for
                        forty-eight hours, I have been simply a queen. I can hardly put my foot to
                        the ground. Christmas morning, these dear Thibault people came again; and
                        then the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">curé</foreign> came; and then some nice
                        Madame Perrons came, and I went to mass with them; and, after mass, their
                        brother's carriage came; and they would take no refusals; but with many
                        apologies to my sweet old hostess, at the Three Cygnets, I was fain to come
                        up to M. Firmin's lovely <foreign xml:lang="FRA">château</foreign> here, and
                        make myself at home till my friends shall arrive. It seems the poor
                        Thibaults had come here to beg the flowers for the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                        have seen in France; and they live on the most patriarchal footing with all
                        the people round<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6578-00000100"/> them. I am sure
                        I ought to speak kindly of them. It is the most fascinating hospitality. So
                        here am I, waiting, with my little <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sac de

                        and here I ate my Christmas dinner. Tell the Colonel that here is "THE

                  <head type="sub">ONE CHRISTMAS MORE.</head>
                  <p>THIS last Christmas party is Huldah's own. It is hers, at least, as much as it
                     is any one's. There are five of them, nay, six, with equal right to precedence
                     in the John o' Groat's house, where she has settled down. It is one of those
                     comfortable houses which are still left three miles out from the old State
                     House in Boston. It is not all on one floor; that would be, perhaps, too much
                     like the golden courts of heaven. There are two stories; but they are connected
                     by a central flight of stairs of easy tread (designed by Charles Cummings); so
                     easy, and so stately withal, that, as you pass over them, you always bless the
                     builder, and hardly know that you go up or down. Five large rooms on each floor
                     give ample room for the five heads of the house, if, indeed, there be not six,
                     as I said before.</p>
                  <p>Into this Saints' Rest, there have drifted together, by the eternal law of
                     attraction,—Huldah, and Ellen Philbrick (who was with her in Virginia and in
                     France, and has been, indeed, but little separated from her, except on duty,
                     for twenty years), and with them three other friends. These women,—well, I
                     cannot introduce them to you without writing three stories of true romance, one
                     for each. This quiet, strong, meditative, helpful saint, who is coming into the
                     parlor now, is Helen Touro. She was left alone with her baby when "The Empire
                     State" went down; and her husband was never heard of more. The love of that
                     baby warmed her to the love of all others; and, when I first knew her, she was
                     ruling over a home of babies, whose own mothers or fathers were not,—always
                     with a heart big enough to say there was room for one more waif in that
                     sanctuary. That older woman, who is writing at the Davenport in the corner,
                     lightened the cares and<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6578-00000101"/> smoothed the
                     daily life of General Schuyler in all the last years of his life, when he was
                     in the Cabinet, in Brazil, and in Louisiana. His wife was long ill, and then
                     died. His children needed all a woman's care; and this woman stepped to the
                     front, cared for them, cared for all his household, cared for him: and I dare
                     not say how much is due to her of that which you and I say daily we owe to him.
                     Miss Peters, I see you know. She served in another regiment; was at the head of
                     the sweetest, noblest, purest school that ever trained, in five and twenty
                     years, five hundred girls to be the queens in five hundred happy and strong
                     families. All of these five,—our Huldah and Mrs. Philbrick too, you have seen
                     before,—all of them have been in "the service;" all of them have known that
                     perfect service is perfect freedom. I think they know that perfect service is
                     the highest honor. They have together taken this house, as they say, for the
                     shelter and home of their old age. But Huldah, as she plays with your Harry
                     there, does not look to me as if she were superannuated yet.</p>
                  <p>"But you said there were six in all."</p>
                  <p>Did I? I suppose there are. "Mrs. Philbrick brick, are there five captains in
                     your establishment, or six?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear Mr. Hale, why do you ask me? You know there are five captains and one
                     general. We have persuaded Seth Corbet to make his home here,—yes, the same who
                     went round the world with Mrs. Cradock. Since her death, he has come home to
                     Boston; and he reports to us, and makes his head-quarters here. He sees that we
                     are all right every morning; and then he goes his rounds to see every
                     grandchild of old Mr. Cradock, and to make sure that every son and daughter of
                     that house is 'all right.' Sometimes he is away over night. This is when
                     somebody in the whole circle of all their friends is more sick than usual, and
                     needs a man nurse. That old man was employed by old Mr. Cradock, in 1816, when
                     he first went to house-keeping. He has had all the sons and all the daughters
                     of that house in his arms; and now that the youngest of them is five and
                     twenty, and the oldest fifty, I suppose he is not satisfied any day until he
                     has seen that they and theirs, in their respective homes, are well. He thinks
                     we here are babies; but he takes care of us all the more courteously."</p>
                  <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6578-00000102"/>
                  <p>"Will he dine with you to-day?"</p>
                  <p>"I am afraid not; but we shall see him at the Christmas-tree after dinner.
                     There is to be a tree."</p>
                  <p>You see, this house was dedicated to the Apotheosis of Noble Ministry. Over the
                     mantel-piece hung Raphael Morghen's large print of "The Lavatio," Caracci's
                     picture of "The Washing of the Feet,"—the only copy I ever saw. We asked Huldah
                     about it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, that was a present from Mr. Burchstadt, a rich manufacturer in Würtemberg,
                     to Ellen. She stumbled into one of those villages when everybody was sick and
                     dying of typhus, and tended and watched and saved, one whole summer long, as
                     Mrs. Ware did at Osmotherly. And this Mr. Burchstadt wanted to do something,
                     and he sent her this in acknowledgment."</p>
                  <p>On the other side was Kaulbach's own study of Elizabeth of Hungary, dropping
                     her apron full of roses.</p>
                  <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Oh! what a sight the apron discloses;</l>
                        <l>The viands are changed to real roses!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
                  <p>When I asked Huldah where that came from, she blushed, and said, "Oh, that was
                     a present to me!" and led us to Steinler's exquisite "Good Shepherd," in a
                     larger and finer print than I had ever seen. Six or eight gentlemen in New
                     York, who, when they were dirty babies from the gutter, had been in Helen
                     Touro's hands, had sent her a portfolio of beautiful prints, each with this
                     same idea, of seeking what was lost. This one she had chosen for the
                     sitting-room.</p>
                  <p>And, on the fourth side, was that dashing group of Horace Vernet's, "Gideon
                     crossing Jordan," with the motto wrought into the frame, "Faint, yet pursuing."
                     These four pictures are all presents to the "girls," as I find I still call
                     them; and, on the easel, Miss Peters had put her copy of "The Tribute Money."
                     There were other pictures in the room; but these five unconsciously told its
                     story.</p>
                  <p>The five "girls" were always all together at Christmas; but, in practice, each
                     of them lived here only two-fifths of her time. "We make that a rule," said
                     Ellen laughing. "If anybody comes for anybody when there are only two here,
                     those two are engaged to each other; and we stay. Not but what they can come
                     and stay here if we cannot go to them." In practice, if any of us in the
                     immense circles which these<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6578-00000103"/> saints
                     had befriended were in a scrape,—as, if a mother was called away from home, and
                     there were some children left, or if scarlet fever got into a house, or if the
                     children had nobody to go to Mt. Desert with them, or if the new house were to
                     be set in order, and nobody knew how,—in any of the trials of well-ordered
                     families, why, we rode over to the Saints' Rest to see if we could not induce
                     one of the five to come and put things through. So that, in practice, there
                     were seldom more than two on the spot there.</p>
                  <p>But we do not get to the Christmas dinner. There were covers for four and
                     twenty; and all the children besides were in a room upstairs, presided over by
                     Maria Munro, who was in her element there. Then our party of twenty-four
                     included men and women of a thousand romances, who had learned and had shown
                     the nobility of service. One or two of us were invited as novices, in the hope
                     perhaps that we might learn.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely was the soup served when the door-bell rang. Nothing else ever made
                     Huldah look nervous. Bartlett, who was there, said in an aside to me, that he
                     had seen her more calm when there was volley firing within hearing of her
                     store-room. Then it rang again. Helen Touro talked more vehemently; and Mrs.
                     Bartlett at her end, started a great laugh. But, when it rang the third time,
                     something had to be said; and Huldah asked one of the girls, who was waiting,
                     if there were no one attending at the door.</p>
                  <p>"Yes'm, Mr. Corbet."</p>
                  <p>But the bell rang a fourth time, and a fifth.</p>
                  <p>"Isabel, you can go to the door. Mr. Corbet must have stepped out."</p>
                  <p>So Isabel went out, but returned with a face as broad as a soup-plate. "Mr.
                     Corbet is there, ma'am."</p>
                  <p>Sixth door-bell peal,—seventh, and eighth.</p>
                  <p>"Mary, I think you had better sea if Mr. Corbet has gone away."</p>
                  <p>Mary returns, face one broad grin.</p>
                  <p>"No, ma'am, Mr. Corbet is there."</p>
                  <p>Heavy steps in the red parlor. Side door-bell—a little gong, begins to ring.
                     Front bell rings ninth time, tenth, and eleventh.</p>
                  <p>Saint John, as we call him, had seen that something was amiss, and had kindly
                     pitched in with a dissertation on the passage of the Red-River Dam, in which
                     the gravy-boats were<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6578-00000104"/> steamships, and
                     the cranberry was General Banks, and the aids were spoons. But, when both
                     door-bells rang together, and there were more steps in the hall, Huldah said,
                     "If you will excuse me," and rose from the table.</p>
                  <p>"No, no, we will not excuse you," cried Clara Hastings. "Nobody will excuse
                     you. This is the one day of the year when you are not to work. Let me go." So
                     Clara went out. And after Clara went out, the door-bells rang no more. I think
                     she cut the bell-wires. She soon came back, and said a man was inquiring his
                     way to the "Smells;" and they directed him to "Wait's Mills," which she hoped
                     would do. And so Huldah's and Grace's stupendous housekeeping went on in its
                     solid order, reminding one of those well-proportioned Worcester teas which are,
                     perhaps, the crown and glory of the New England science in this matter. I
                     ventured to ask Sam Root, who sat by me, if the Marlborough were not equal to
                     his mother's.</p>
                  <p>And we sat long; and we laughed loud. We talked war and poetry and genealogy.
                     We rallied Helen Touro about her housekeeping; and Dr. Worster pretended to
                     give a list of Surgeons and Majors and Major-Generals who had made love to
                     Huldah. By and by, when the grapes and the bonbons came, the sixteen children
                     were led in by Maria Munro, who had, till now, kept them at games of string and
                     hunt the slipper. And, at last, Seth Corbet flung open the door into the red
                     parlor to announce "The Tree."</p>
                  <p>Sure enough, there was the tree, as the five saints had prepared it for the
                     invited children,—glorious in gold, and white with wreaths of snow-flakes, and
                     blazing with candles. Sam Root kissed Grace, and said, "O Grace! do you
                     remember?" But the tree itself did not surprise the children as much as the
                     five tables at the right and the left, behind and before, amazed the Sainted
                     Five, who were indeed the children now. A box of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >vin rouge de Bourgogne,</foreign> from Louis, was the first thing my eye
                     lighted on, and above it a little banner read, "Huldah's table." And then I saw
                     that there were these five tables, heaped with the Christmas offerings to the
                     five saints. It proved that everybody, the world over, had heard that they had
                     settled down. Everybody in the four hemispheres,—if there be four,—who had
                     remembered the unselfish service of these five, had thought this<pb n="184-185"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000105"/> a fit time for commemorating such unselfish
                     love, were it only by such a present as a lump of coal. Almost everybody, I
                     think, had made Seth Corbet a confidant; and so, while the five saints were
                     planning their pretty tree for the sixteen children, the North and the South,
                     and the East and the West, were sending myrrh and frankincense and gold to
                     them. The pictures were hung with Southern moss from Barthow. Boys, who were
                     now men, had sent coral from India, pearl from Ceylon, and would have been glad
                     to send ice from Greenland, had Christmas come in midsummer; there were
                     diamonds from Brazil, and silver from Nevada, from those who lived there; there
                     were books, in the choicest binding, in memory of copies of the same word, worn
                     by travel, or dabbled in blood; there were pictures, either by the hand of near
                     friendship, or by the master hand of genius, which brought back the memories,
                     perhaps, of some old adventure in "The Service,"—perhaps, as the Kaulbach did,
                     of one of those histories which makes all service sacred. In five and twenty
                     years of life, these women had so surrounded themselves, without knowing it or
                     thinking of it, with loyal, yes, adoring friends, that the accident of their
                     finding a fixed home had called in all at once this wealth of acknowledgment
                     from those whom they might have forgotten, but who would never forget them.
                     And, by the accident of our coming together, we saw, in these heaps on heaps of
                     offerings of love, some faint record of the lives they had enlivened, the
                     wounds they had stanched, the tears they had wiped away, and the homes they had
                     cheered. For themselves, the five saints—as I have called them—were laughing
                     and crying together, quite upset in the surprise. For ourselves, there was not
                     one of us who, in this little visible display of the range of years of service,
                     did not take in something more of the meaning of,—</p>

                  <p>The surprise, the excitement, the laughter, and the tears found vent in the
                     children's eagerness to be led to their tree; and, in three minutes, Ellen was
                     opening boxes, and Huldah pulling fire-crackers, as if they had not been thrown
                     off their balance. But, when each boy and girl had two arms full, and the fir
                     balsam sent down from New Durham was nearly bare,<pb n="186-187"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000106"/> Edgar Bartlett pointed to the top bough, where
                     was a brilliant not noticed before. No one had noticed it,—not Seth
                     himself,—who had most of the other secrets of that house in his possession. I
                     am sure that no man, woman, or child knew how the thing came there: but Seth
                     lifted the little discoverer high in air, and he brought it down triumphant. It
                     was a parcel made up in shining silvered paper. Seth cut the strings.</p>
                  <p>It contained twelve Maltese crosses of gold, with as many jewels, one in the
                     heart of each,—I think the blazing twelve of the Revelations. They were
                     displayed on ribbons of blue and white, six of which bore Huldah's, Helen's,
                     Ellen Philbrick's, Hannah's, Miss Peters's, and Seth Corbet's names. The other
                     six had no names; but on the gold of these was marked,—"From Huldah, to ——"
                     "From Helen, to ——" and so on, as if these were decorations which they were to
                     pass along. The saints themselves were the last to understand the decorations;
                     but the rest of us caught the idea, and pinned them on their breasts. As we did
                     so, the ribbons unfolded, and displayed the motto of the order:—</p>
                  <p>"Henceforth I call you not servants, I have called you friends."</p>
                  <p>It was at that Christmas that the "ORDER OF LOVING SERVICE" was born.</p>

               <head type="sub">A STORY FOR CHILDREN.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>THERE was a King of Hungary whose name was Adelbert.</p>
                  <p>When he lived at home, which was not often, it was in a castle of many towers
                     and many halls and many stairways, in the city of Buda, by the side of the
                     river Donau.</p>
                  <p>He had four daughters, and only one son, who was to be the King after him,
                     whose name was Ladislaus. But it was the custom of those times, as boys and
                     girls grew up, to send them for their training to some distance from their
                     home, even for many months at a time, to try a little experiment on them, and
                     see how they fared; and so, at the time I tell you of, there was staying in the
                     castle of Buda the Prince Bela, who was the son of the King of Bohemia; and he
                     and the boy Ladislaus studied their lessons together, and flew their kites, and
                     hunted for otters, and rode with the falconers together.</p>
                  <p>One day as they were studying with the tutor, who was a priest named Stephen,
                     he gave to them a book of fables, and each read a fable.</p>
                  <p>Ladislaus read the fable of the</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>SKY-LARK.</head>
                     <p>The sky-lark sat on the topmost bough of the savy-tree, and was waked by the
                        first ray of the sun. Then the sky-lark flew and flew up and up to the
                        topmost arch of the sky, and sang the hymn of the morning.</p>
                     <p>But a frog, who was croaking in the cranberry marsh, said, "Why do you take
                        such pains and fly so high? the sun shines here, and I can sing here."</p>
                     <p>And the bird said, "God has made me to fly. God has made me to see. I will
                        fly as high as He will lift me, and sing so loud that all shall hear
                        me."</p>
                     <p>And when the little Prince Ladislaus had read the fable, he cried out, "The
                        sky-lark is<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6578-00000108"/> the bird for me, and
                        I will paint his picture on my shield after school this morning."</p>
                     <p>Then the Prince Bela read the next fable,—the fable of the</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>WATER-RAT.</head>
                     <p>A good beaver found one day a little water-rat almost dead. His father and
                        mother had been swept away by a freshet, and the little rat was almost
                        starved. But the kind beaver gave him of her own milk, and brought him up in
                        her own lodge with her children, and he got well, and could eat, and swim,
                        and dive with the best of them.</p>
                     <p>But one day there was a great alarm, that the beavers' dam was giving way
                        before the water. "Come one, come all," said the grandfather of the beavers,
                        "come to the rescue." So they all started, carrying sticks and bark with
                        them, the water-rat and all. But as they swam under an old oak-tree's root,
                        the water-rat stopped in the darkness, and then he quietly turned round and
                        went back to the hut. "It will be hard work," said he "and there are enough
                        of them." There were enough of them. They mended the dam by working all
                        night and by working all day. But, as they came back, a great wave of the
                        freshet came pouring over the dam and, though the dam stood firm, the
                        beavers were swept away,—away and away, down the river into the sea, and
                        they died there.</p>
                     <p>And the water-rat lived in their grand house by himself, and had all their
                        stores of black-birch bark and willow bark and sweet poplar bark for his
                        own.</p>
                     <p>"That was a clever rat," said the Prince Bela. "I will paint the rat on my
                        shield, when school is done." And the priest Stephen was very sad when he
                        said so; and the Prince Ladislaus was surprised.</p>
                     <p>So they went to the play-room and painted their shields. The shields were
                        made of the bark of hemlock-trees. Ladislaus chipped off the rough bark till
                        the shield was white, and made on the place the best sky-lark he could paint
                        there. And Bela watched him, and chipped off the rough bark from his shield,
                        and said, "You paint so well, now paint my water-rat for me." "No," said
                        Ladislaus, though he was very good-natured, "I cannot paint it well. You
                        must paint it yourself." And Bela did so.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>SO the boys both grew up, and one became King of Hungary, and one was the King
                     of the Bohemians. And King Ladislaus carried on his banner the picture of a
                     sky-lark; and the ladies of the land embroidered sky-larks for the scarfs and
                     for the pennons of the soldiers, and for the motto of the banner were the Latin
                     words "Propior Deo," which mean "Nearer to God." And King Bela carried the
                     water-rat for his cognizance; and the ladies of his land embroidered water-rats
                     for the soldiers; and his motto was "Enough."</p>
                  <p>And in these times a holy man from Palestine came through all the world; and he
                     told how the pilgrims to the tomb of Christ were beaten and starved by the
                     Saracens, and how many of them were dying in dungeons. And he begged the
                     princes and the lords and ladies, for the love of God and the love of Christ,
                     that they would come and rescue these poor people, and secure the pilgrims in
                     all coming time. And King Ladislaus said to his people, "We will do the best we
                     can, and serve God as He shows us how!" And the people said, "We will do the
                     best we can, and save the people of Christ from the infidel!" And they all came
                     together to the place of arms; and the King chose a hundred of the bravest and
                     healthiest of the young men, all of whom told the truth, and no one of whom was
                     afraid to die, and they marched with him to the land of Christ; and as they
                     marched they sang, "Propior Deo,"—"Nearer to Thee."</p>
                  <p>And Peter the Hermit went to Bohemia, and told the story of the cruel Saracens
                     and the sufferings of the pilgrims to King Bela and his people. And the King
                     said, "Is it far away?" And the Hermit said, "Far, far away." And the King
                     said, "Ah, well,—they must get out as they got in. We will take care of
                     Bohemia." So the Hermit went on to Saxony, to tell his story.</p>
                  <p>And King Ladislaus and his hundred true young men rode and rode day by day, and
                     came to the Mount of Olives just in time to be at the side of the great King
                     Godfrey, when he broke the Paynim's walls, and dashed into the city of
                     Jerusalem. And King Ladislaus and his men rode together along the Way of Tears,
                     where Christ bore the cross-beam upon his shoulder,<pb n="194-195"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000110"/> and he sat on the stone where the cross had been
                     reared, and he read the gospel through again; and there he prayed his God that
                     he might always bear his cross bravely, and that, like the Lord Jesus, he might
                     never be afraid to die.</p>

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>AND when they had all come home to Hungary, their time hung very heavy on their
                     hands. And the young men said to the King, "Lead us to war against the Finns,
                     or lead us to war against the Russ."</p>
                  <p>But the King said, "No! if they spare our people, we spare their people. Let us
                     have peace." And he called the young men who had fought with him, and he said,
                     "The time hangs heavy with us; let us build a temple here to the living God,
                     and to the honor of his Son. We will carve on its walls the story we have seen,
                     and while we build we will remember Zion and the Way of Tears."</p>
                  <p>And the young men said, "We are not used to building."</p>
                  <p>"Nor am I," said the King; "but let us build, and build as best we can, and
                     give to God the best we have and the best we know."</p>
                  <p>So they dug the deep trenches for the foundations, and they sent north and
                     south, and east and west for the wisest builders who loved the Lord Christ; and
                     the builders came, and the carvers came, and the young men learned to use the
                     chisel and the hammer; and the great Cathedral grew year by year, as a
                     pine-tree in the forest grows above the birches and the yew-trees on the
                     ground.</p>
                  <p>And once King Bela came to visit his kinsman, and they rode out to see the
                     builders. And King Ladislaus dismounted from his horse, and asked Bela to
                     dismount, and gave to him a chisel and a hammer.</p>
                  <p>"No," said the King Bela, "it will hurt my hands. In my land we have workmen
                     whom we pay to do these things. But I like to see you work."</p>
                  <p>So he sat upon his horse till dinner-time, and he went home.</p>
                  <p>And year by year the Cathedral grew. And a thousand pinnacles were built upon
                     the towers and on the roof and along the walls; and on each pinnacle there
                     fluttered a golden<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6578-00000111"/> sky-lark. And on
                     the altar in the Cathedral was a scroll of crimson, and on the crimson scroll
                     were letters of gold, and the letters were in the Latin language, and said
                     "Propior Deo," and on a blue scroll underneath, in the language of the people
                     they were translated, and it said, "Nearer to Thee."</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>AND another Hermit came, and he told the King that the Black Death was ravaging
                     the cities of the East; that half the people of Constantinople were dead; that
                     the great fair at Adrianople was closed; that the ships on the Black Sea had no
                     sailors; and that there would be no food for the people on the lower river.</p>
                  <p>And the King said, "Is the Duke dead, whom we saw at Bucharest; is the Emperor
                     dead, who met me at Constantinople?"</p>
                  <p>"No, your Grace," said the Hermit, "it pleases the Lord that in the Black Death
                     only those die who live in hovels and in towns. The Lord has spared those who
                     live in castles and in palaces."</p>
                  <p>"Then," said King Ladislaus, "I will live as my people live, and I will die as
                     my people die. The Lord Jesus had no pillow for his head, and no house for his
                     lodging; and as the least of his brethren fares so will I fare, and as I fare
                     so shall they."</p>
                  <p>So the King and the hundred braves pitched their tents on the high land above
                     the old town, around the new Cathedral, and the Queen and the ladies of the
                     court went with them. And day by day the King and the Queen and the hundred
                     braves and their hundred ladies went up and down the filthy wynds and courts of
                     the city, and they said to the poor people there, "Come, live as we live, and
                     die as we die."</p>
                  <p>And the people left the holes of pestilence and came and lived in the open air
                     of God.</p>
                  <p>And when the people saw that the King fared as they fared, the people said, "We
                     also will seek God as the King seeks Him, and will serve Him as he serves
                     Him."</p>
                  <p>And day by day they found others who had no homes fit for Christian men, and
                     brought them upon the high land and built all together their tents and booths
                     and tabernacles, open to the sun and light, and to the smile and kiss<pb
                        n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6578-00000112"/> and blessing of the fresh air of
                     God. And there grew a new and beautiful city there.</p>
                  <p>And so it was, that when the Black Death passed from the East to the West, the
                     Angel of Death left the city of Buda on one side, and the people never saw the
                     pestilence with their eyes. The Angel of Death passed by them, and rested upon
                     the cities of Bohemia.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>AND King Ladislaus grew old. His helmet seemed to him more heavy. His sleep
                     seemed to him more coy. But he had little care, for he had a loving wife, and
                     he had healthy, noble sons and daughters, who loved God, and who told the
                     truth, and who were not afraid to die.</p>
                  <p>But one day, in his happy prosperity, there came to him a messenger running,
                     who said in the Council, "Your Grace, the Red Russians have crossed the Red
                     River of the north, and they are marching with their wives and their children
                     with their men of arms in front, and their wagons behind, and they say they
                     will find a land nearer the sun, and to this land are they coming."</p>
                  <p>And the old King smiled; and he said to those that were left of the hundred
                     brave men who took the cross with him, "Now we will see if our boys could have
                     fought at Godfrey's side. For us it matters little. One way or another way we
                     shall come nearer to God."</p>
                  <p>And the armorers mended the old armor, and the young men girded on swords which
                     had never been tried in fight, and the pennons that they bore were embroidered
                     by their sweethearts and sisters as in the old days of the Crusades, and with
                     the same device of a sky-lark in mid-heaven, and the motto, "Nearer, my God, to
                     Thee."</p>
                  <p>And there came from the great Cathedral the wise men who had come from all the
                     lands. They found the King, and they said to him, "Your Grace, we know how to
                     build the new defences for the land, and we will guard the river ways, that the
                     barbarians shall never enter them."</p>
                  <p>And when the people knew that the Red Russians were on the way, they met in the
                     square and marched to the palace, and Robert the Smith mounted the steps of the
                     palace and called the King. And he said, "The people<pb n="200-201"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000113"/> are here to bid the King be of good heart. The
                     people bid me say that they will die for their King and for his land."</p>
                  <p>And the King took from his wife's neck the blue ribbon that she wore, with a
                     golden sky-lark on it, and bound it round the blacksmith's arm, and he said,
                     "If I die, it is nothing; if I live, it is nothing; that is in God's hand. But
                     whether we live or die, let us draw as near Him as we may."</p>
                  <p>And the Blacksmith Robert turned to the people, and with his loud voice, told
                     what the King had said.</p>
                  <p>And the people answered in the shout which the Hungarians shout to this day,
                     "Let us die for our king! Let us die for our king!"</p>
                  <p>And the King called the Queen hastily, and they and their children led the host
                     to the great Cathedral.</p>
                  <p>And the old priest Stephen, who was ninety years old, stood at the altar, and
                     he read the gospel where it says, "Fear not, little flock, it is your Father's
                     good pleasure to give you the kingdom."</p>
                  <p>And he read the other gospel where the Lord says, "And I, if I be lifted up,
                     will draw all men unto me." And he read the epistle where it says, "No man
                     liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself." And he chanted the psalm, "The
                     Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer."</p>
                  <p>And fifty thousand men, with one heart and one voice, joined with him. And the
                     King joined, and the Queen to sing, "The Lord is my rock, my fortress, and my
                     deliverer."</p>
                  <p>And they marched from the Cathedral, singing in the language of the country,
                     "Propior Deo," which is to say in our tongue, "Nearer, my God, to Thee."</p>
                  <p>And the aged braves who had fought with Godfrey, and the younger men who had
                     learned of arms in the University, went among the people and divided them into
                     companies for the war. And Robert the Blacksmith, and all the guild of the
                     blacksmiths, and of the braziers, and of the coppersmiths, and of the
                     whitesmiths, even the goldsmiths, and the silversmiths, made weapons for the
                     war; and the masons and the carpenters, and the ditchers and delvers marched
                     out with the cathedral builders to the narrow passes of the river, and built
                     new the fortresses.</p>
                  <p>And the Lady Constance and her daughters,<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000114"/> and every lady in the land, went to the churches
                     and the convents, and threw them wide open. And in the kitchens they baked
                     bread for the soldiers; and in the churches they spread couches for the sick or
                     for the wounded.</p>
                  <p>And when the Red Russians came in their host, there was not a man, or woman, or
                     child in all Hungary but was in the place to which God had called him, and was
                     doing his best in his place for his God, for the Church of Christ, and for his
                     brothers and sisters of the land.</p>
                  <p>And the host of the Red Russians was turned aside, as at the street corner you
                     have seen the dirty water of a gutter turned aside by the curbstone. They
                     fought one battle against the Hungarian host, and were driven as the blackbirds
                     are driven by the falcons. And they gathered themselves and swept westward; and
                     came down upon the passes to Bohemia.</p>
                  <p>And there were no fortresses at the entrance to Bohemia; for King Bela had no
                     learned men who loved him. And there was no army in the plains of Bohemia; for
                     his people had been swept away in the pestilence. And there were no brave men
                     who had fought with Godfrey, and knew the art of arms, for in those old days
                     the King had said, "It is far away; and we have 'enough' in Bohemia."</p>
                  <p>So the Red Russians, who call themselves the Szechs, took his land from him;
                     and they live there till this day. And the King, without a battle, fled from
                     the back-door of his palace, in the disguise of a charcoal-man; and he left his
                     queen and his daughters to be cinder-girls in the service of the Chief of the
                     Red Russians.</p>
                  <p>And the false charcoal-man walked by day, and walked by night, till he found
                     refuge in the castle of the King Ladislaus; and he met him in the old
                     school-room where they read the fables together. And he remembered how the
                     water-rat came to the home of the beavers.</p>
                  <p>And he said to King Ladislaus,—</p>
                  <p>"Ah, me! do you remember when we were boys together? Do you remember the fable
                     of the Sky-lark, and the fable of the Water-rat?"</p>
                  <p>"I remember both," said the King. And he was silent.</p>
                  <p>"God has been very kind to you," said the beggar; "and He has been very hard to
                     me."</p>
                  <p>And the King said nothing.</p>
                  <p>But the old priest Stephen, said,—</p>
                  <p>"God is always kind. But God will not give<pb n="204-205"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000115"/> us other fruit than we sow seed for. The King
                     here has tried to serve God as he knew how; with one single eye he has looked
                     on the world of God, and he has made the best choice he knew. And God has given
                     him what he thought not of: brave men for his knights; wise men for his
                     council; a free and loving people for his army. And you have not looked with a
                     single eye; your eye was darkened. You saw only what served yourself. And you
                     said, 'This is enough;' and you had no brave men for your knights; no wise men
                     for your council; no people for your army. You chose to look down, and to take
                     a selfish brute for your adviser. And he has led you so far. We choose to look
                     up; to draw nearer God; and where He leads we follow."</p>
                  <p>Then King Ladislaus ordered that in the old school-room a bed should be spread
                     for Bela; and that every day his breakfast and his dinner and his supper should
                     be served to him; and he lived there till he died.</p>

               <head>THE STORY OF OELLO.</head>
               <p>ONCE upon a time there was a young girl, who had the pretty name of Oello. I say,
                  once upon a time, because I do not know when the time was,—nor do I know what the
                  place was,—though my story, in the main, is a true story. I do not mean that I sat
                  by and saw Oello when she wove and when she spun. But I know she did weave and did
                  spin. I do not mean that I heard her speak the word I tell of; for it was many,
                  many hundred years ago. But I do know that she must have said some such words; for
                  I know many of the things which she did, and much of what kind of girl she
                  was.</p>
               <p>She grew up like other girls in her country. She did not know how to read. None of
                  them knew how to read. But she knew how to braid straw, and to make fish-nets and
                  to catch<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6578-00000116"/> fish. She did not know how to
                  spell. Indeed, in that country they had no letters. But she knew how to split open
                  the fish she had caught, how to clean them, how to broil them on the coals, and
                  how to eat them neatly. She had never studied the "analysis of her language." But
                  she knew how to use it like a lady; that is, prettily, simply, without pretence,
                  and always truly. She could sing her baby brother to sleep. She could tell stories
                  to her sisters all day long. And she and they were not afraid when evening came,
                  or when they were in any trouble, to say a prayer aloud to the good God. So they
                  got along, although they could not analyze their language. She knew no geography.
                  She could count her fingers, and the stars in the Southern Cross. She had never
                  seen Orion, or the stars in the Great Bear, or the Pole-Star.</p>
               <p>Oello was very young when she married a young kinsman, with whom she had grown up
                  since they were babies. Nobody knows much about him. But he loved her and she
                  loved him. And when morning came they were not afraid to pray to God together,—and
                  when night came she asked her husband to forgive her if she had troubled him, and
                  he asked her to forgive him,—so that their worries and trials never lasted out the
                  day. And they lived a very happy life, till they were very old and died.</p>
               <p>There is a bad gap in the beginning of their history. I do not know how it
                  happened. But the first I knew of them, they had left their old home and were
                  wandering alone on foot toward the South. Sometimes I have thought a great
                  earthquake had wrecked their old happy home. Sometimes I have thought there was
                  some horrid pestilence, or fire. No matter what happened, something happened,—so
                  that Oello and her husband, of a hot, very hot day, were alone under a forest of
                  laurels mixed with palms, with bright flowering orchids on them, looking like a
                  hundred butterflies; ferns, half as high as the church is, tossing over them;
                  nettles as large as trees, and tangled vines, threading through the whole. They
                  were tired, oh, how tired! hungry, oh, how hungry! and hot and foot-sore.</p>
               <p>"I wish so we were out of this hole," said he to her, "and yet I am afraid of the
                  people we shall find when we come down to the lake side."</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6578-00000117"/>
               <p>"I do not know," said Oello, "why they should want to hurt us."</p>
               <p>"I do not know why they should want to," said he, "but I am afraid they will hurt
                  us."</p>
               <p>"But we do not want to hurt them," said she. "For my part, all I want is a shelter
                  to live under; and I will help them take care of their children, and <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">

                        <l>And pound their corn,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And bake their bread.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"How will you tell them that you will do this?" said he.</p>
               <p>"I will do it," said Oello, "and that will be better than telling them."</p>
               <p>"But do not you just wish," said he, "that you could speak five little words of
                  their <choice>
                     <sic>langauge</sic>
                     <corr>language</corr>
                  </choice>, to say to them that we come as friends, and not as enemies?"</p>
               <p>Oello laughed very heartily. "Enemies," said she, "terrible enemies, who have two
                  sticks for their weapons, two old bags for their stores, and cotton clothes for
                  their armor. I do not believe more than half the army will turn out against us."
                  So Oello pulled out the potatoes from the ashes, and found they were baked; she
                  took a little salt from her haversack or scrip, and told her husband that dinner
                  would be ready, if he would only bring some water. He pretended to groan, but
                  went, and came in a few minutes with two gourds full, and they made a very merry
                  meal.</p>
               <p>The same evening they came cautiously down on the beautiful meadow land which
                  surrounded the lake they had seen. It is one of the most beautiful countries in
                  the world. It was an hour before sunset,—the hour, I suppose, when all countries
                  are most beautiful. Oello and her husband came joyfully down the hill, through a
                  little track the llamas had made toward the water, wondering at the growth of the
                  wild grasses, and, indeed, the freshness of all the green; when they were startled
                  by meeting a horde of the poor, naked, half-starved Indians, who were just as much
                  alarmed to meet with them.</p>
               <p>I do not think that the most stupid of them could have supposed Oello an enemy,
                  nor her husband. For they stepped cheerfully down the path, waving boughs of fresh
                  cinchona as tokens of peace, and looking kindly and pleasantly<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000118"/> antly on the poor Indians, as I believe nobody had
                  looked on them before. There were fifty of the savages, but it was true that they
                  were as much afraid of the two young Northerners as if they had been an army. They
                  saw them coming down the hill, with the western sun behind them, and one of the
                  women cried out, "They are children of the sun, they are children of the sun!" and
                  Oello and her husband looked so as if they had come from a better world that all
                  the other savages believed it.</p>
               <p>But the two young people came down so kindly and quickly, that the Indian women
                  could not well run away. And when Oello caught one of the little babies up, and
                  tossed it in her arms, and fondled it, and made it laugh, the little girl's mother
                  laughed too. And when they had all once laughed together, peace was made among
                  them all, and Oello saw where the Indian women had been lying, and what their poor
                  little shelters were, and she led the way there, and sat down on a log that had
                  fallen there, and called the children round her, and began teaching them a funny
                  game with a bit of crimson cord. Nothing pleases savage people or tame people more
                  than attention to their children, and in less time than I have been telling this
                  they were all good friends. The Indian women produced supper. Pretty poor supper
                  it was. Some fresh-water clams from the lake, some snails which Oello really
                  shuddered at, but some bananas which were very nice, and some ulloco, a root Oello
                  had never seen before, and which she thought sickish. But she acted on her motto.
                  "I will do the best I can," she had said all along; so she ate and drank, as if
                  she had always been used to raw snails and to ulloco, and made the wild women
                  laugh by trying to imitate the names of the strange food. In a few minutes after
                  supper the sun set. There is no twilight in that country. When the sun goes down, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">"Like battle target red,—</l>

                        <l>Then sinks at once, and all is night."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> The savage people showed the strangers a poor little booth to sleep in, and
                  went away to their own lairs, with many prostrations, for they really thought them
                  "children of the sun."</p>
               <p>Oello and her husband laughed very heartily when they knew they were alone. Oello
                     made<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6578-00000119"/> him promise to go in the
                  morning early for potatoes, and oca, and mashua, which are two other tubers like
                  potatoes which grow there. "And we will show them," said she, "how to cook them."
                  For they had seen by the evening feast, that the poor savage people had no
                  knowledge of the use of fire. So, early in the morning, he went up a little way on
                  the lake shore, and returned with strings of all these roots, and with another
                  string of fish he had caught in a brook above. And when the savage people waked
                  and came to Oello's hut, they found her and her husband just starting their
                  fire,—a feat these people had never seen before.</p>
               <p>He had cut with his copper knife a little groove in some soft palm-wood, and he
                  had fitted in it a round piece of iron-wood, and round the iron-wood had bound a
                  bow-string, and while Oello held the palm-wood firm, he made the iron-wood fly
                  round and round and round, till the pith of the palm smoked, and smoked, and at
                  last a flake of the pith caught fire, and then another and another, and Oello
                  dropped other flakes upon these, and blew them gently, and fed them with dry
                  leaves, till they were all in a blaze.</p>
               <p>The savage people looked on with wonder and terror. They cried out when they saw
                  the blaze, "They are children of the sun,—they are children of the sun!"—and ran
                  away. Oello and her husband did not know what they said, and went on broiling the
                  fish and baking the potatoes, and the mashua, and the oca, and the ulloco.</p>
               <p>And when they were ready, Oello coaxed some of the children to come back, and next
                  their mothers came and next the men. But still they said, "They are children of
                  the sun." And when they ate of the food that had been cooked for them, they said
                  it was the food of the immortals.</p>
               <p>Now, in Oello's home, this work of making the fire from wood had been called
                  menial work, and was left to servants only. But even the princes of that land were
                  taught never to order another to do what they could not do themselves. And thus it
                  happened that the two young travellers could do it so well. And thus it was, that,
                  because they did what they could, the savage people honored them with such
                  exceeding honor, and because they did the work of servants they called them gods.
                  As it is<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6578-00000120"/> written: "He who is greatest
                  among you shall be your servant."</p>
               <p>And this was much the story of that day and many days. While her husband went off
                  with the men, taught them how he caught the fish, and how they could catch
                  huanacos, Oello sat in the shade with the children, who were never tired of
                  pulling at the crimson cord around her waist, and at the tassels of her
                  head-dress. All savage children are curious about the dress of their visitors. So
                  it was easy for Oello to persuade them to go with her and pick tufts of wild
                  cotton, till they had quite a store of it, and then to teach them to spin it on
                  distaffs she made for them from laurel-wood, and at last to braid it and to knit
                  it,—till at last one night, when the men came home, Oello led out thirty of the
                  children in quite a grand procession, dressed all of them in pretty cotton suits
                  they had knit for themselves, instead of the filthy, greasy skins they had always
                  worn before. This was a great triumph for Oello; but when the people would gladly
                  have worshipped her, she only said, "I did what I could,—I did what I could,—say
                  no more, say no more."</p>
               <p>And as the year passed by, she and her husband band taught the poor people how, if
                  they would only plant the maize, they could have all they wanted in the winter,
                  and if they planted the roots of the ulloco, and the oca, and the mashua, and the
                  potato, they would have all they needed of them; how they might make long
                  fish-ways for the fish, and pitfalls for the llama. And they learned the language
                  of the poor people, and taught them the language to which they themselves were
                  born. And year by year their homes grew neater and more cheerful. And year by year
                  the children were stronger and better. And year by year the world in that part of
                  it was more and more subdued to the will and purpose of a good God. And whenever
                  Manco, Oello's husband, was discouraged, she always said, "We will do the best we
                  can," and always it proved that that was all that a good God wanted them to
                  do.</p>
               <p>It was from the truth and steadiness of those two people, Manco and Oello, that
                  the great nation of Peru was raised up from a horde of savages, starving in the
                  mountains, to one of the most civilized and happy nations of their times.
                  Unfortunately for their descendants, they did not learn the use of iron or
                     gunpowder<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6578-00000121"/> powder, so that the cruel
                  Spaniards swept them and theirs away. But for hundreds of years they lived
                  peacefully and happily,—growing more and more civilized with every year, because
                  the young Oello and her husband Manco had done what they could for them.</p>
               <p>They did not know much. But what they knew they could do. They were not, so far as
                  we know, skilful in talking. But they were cheerful in acting.</p>
               <p>They did not hide their light under a bushel. They made it shine on all that came
                  around. Their duties were the humblest, only making a fire in the morning,
                  cleaning potatoes and cooking them, spinning, braiding, twisting, and weaving.
                  This was the best Oello could do. She did that, and in doing it she reared an
                  empire. We can contrast her life with that of the savages around her. As we can
                  see a drop of blood when it falls into a cup of water, we can see how that one
                  life swayed theirs. If she had lived among her kindred, and done at home these
                  simple things, we should never have heard her name. But none the less would she
                  have done them. None the less, year in and year out, century in and century out,
                  would that sweet, loving, true, unselfish life have told in God's service. And he
                  would have known it, though you and I—who are we?—had never heard her name!</p>
               <p>Forgotten! do not ever think that anything is forgotten!</p>

               <head>LOVE IS THE WHOLE.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STORY FOR CHILDREN.</head>
               <p>THIS is a story about some children who were living together in a Western State,
                  in a little house on the prairie, nearly two miles from any other. There were
                  three boys and three girls; the oldest girl was seventeen, and her oldest brother
                  a year younger. Their mother had died two or three years before, and now their
                  father grew sick,—more sick and more, and died also. The children were taking the
                  best care they could of him, wondering and watching. But no care could do much,
                  and so he told them. He told them all that he should not live long; but that when
                  he died he should not be far from them, and should be with their dear mother.
                  "Remember," he said, "to love each other. Be kind to each other. Stick together,
                  if you can. Or, if you separate, love one another as if you were together." He did
                  not say any more then. He lay still awhile, with his eyes closed; but every now
                  and then a sweet smile swept over his face, so that they knew he was awake. Then
                  he roused up once more, and said, "Love is the whole, George; love is the
                  whole,"—and so he died.</p>
               <p>I have no idea that the children, in the midst of their grief and loneliness, took
                  in his meaning. But afterwards they remembered it again and again, and found out
                  why he said it to them.</p>
               <p>Any of you would have thought it a queer little house. It was not a log cabin.
                  They had not many logs there. But it was no larger than the log cabin which
                  General Grant is building in the picture. There was a little entry-way at one end,
                  and two rooms opening on the right as you went. A flight of steps went up into the
                  loft, and in the loft the boys slept in two beds. This was all. But if they had no
                  rooms for servants, on the other hand they had no servants for rooms. If they had
                  no hot-water pipes, on the other hand a large kettle hung on the crane above the
                  kitchen fire, and there was but a very short period of any day<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000123"/> that one could not dip out hot water. They had no
                  gas-pipes laid through the house. But they went to bed the earlier, and were the
                  more sure to enjoy the luxury of the great morning illumination by the sun. They
                  lost but few steps in going from room to room. They were never troubled for want
                  of fresh air. They had no door-bell, so no guest was ever left waiting in the
                  cold. And though they had no speaking-tubes in the house, still they found no
                  difficulty in calling each other if Ethan were up stairs and Alice wanted him to
                  come down.</p>
               <p>Their father was buried, and the children were left alone. The first night after
                  the funeral they stole to their beds as soon as they could, after the mock supper
                  was over. The next morning George and Fanny found themselves the first to meet at
                  the kitchen hearth. Each had tried to anticipate the other in making the morning
                  fire. Each confessed to the other that there had been but little sleep, and that
                  the night had seemed hopelessly long.</p>
               <p>"But I have thought it all over," said the brave, stout boy. "Father told us to
                  stick together as long as we can. And I know I can manage it. The children will
                  all do their best when they understand it. And I know, though father could not
                  believe it, I know that I can manage with the team. We will never get in debt. I
                  shall never drink. Drink and debt, as he used to say, are the only two devils.
                  Never you cry, darling Fanny, I know we can get along."</p>
               <p>"George," said Fanny, "I know we can get along if you say so. I know it will be
                  very hard upon you. There are so many things the other young men do which you will
                  not be able to do; and so many things which they have which you might have. But
                  none of them has a sister who loves them as I love you. And, as he said, 'Love is
                  the whole.'"</p>
               <p>I suppose those words over the hearth were almost the only words of sentiment
                  which ever passed between those two about their plans. But from that moment those
                  plans went forward more perfectly than if they had been talked over at every turn,
                  and amended every day. That is the way with all true stories of hearth and
                  home.</p>
               <p>For instance, it was only that evening, when the day's work of all the six was
                  done—and, for boys and girls, it was hard work, too—<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000124"/> Fanny and George would have been glad enough, both
                  of them, to take each a book, and have the comfort of resting and reading. But
                  George saw that the younger girls looked downcast and heavy, and that the boys
                  were whispering round the door-steps as if they wanted to go down to the
                  blacksmith's shop by way of getting away from the sadness of the house. He hated
                  to have them begin the habit of loafing there, with all the lazy boys and men from
                  three miles round. And so he laid down his book, and said, as cheerily as if he
                  had not laid his father's body in the grave the day before,—</p>
               <p>"What shall we do to-night that we can all do together? Let us have something that
                  we have never had before. Let us try what Mrs. Chisholm told us about. Let us act
                  a ballad."</p>
               <p>Of course the children were delighted with acting. George knew that, and Fanny
                  looked across so gratefully to him, and laid her book away also; and, in a minute,
                  Ethan, the young carpenter of the family, was putting up sconces for tallow
                  candles to light the scenes, and Fanny had Sarah and Alice out in the wood-house,
                  with the shawls, and the old ribbons, and strips of bright calico, which made up
                  the dresses, and George instructed Walter as to the way in which he should arrange
                  his armor and his horse, and so, after a period of preparation, which was much
                  longer than the period of performance, they got ready to act in the kitchen the
                  ballad of Lochinvar.</p>
               <p>The children had a happy evening. They were frightened when they went to bed—the
                  little ones—because they had been so merry. They came together with George and
                  Fanny, and read their Bible as they had been used to do with their father, and the
                  last text they read was, "Love is the fulfilling of the law." So the little ones
                  went to bed, and left George and Fanny again together.</p>
               <p>"Pretty hard, was it not?" said she, smiling through her tears. "But it is so much
                  best for them that home should be the happiest place of all for them. After all,
                  'Love is the whole.'"</p>
               <p>And that night's sacrifice, which the two older children made to the younger
                  brothers and sisters as it were over their father's grave, was the beginning of
                  many such nights, and of many other joint amusements which the children<pb
                     n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6578-00000125"/> arranged together. They read Dickens
                  aloud. They cleared out the corn-room at the end of the wood-house for a place for
                  their dialogues and charades. The neighbors' children liked to come in, and, under
                  very strict rules of early hours and of good behavior, they came. And George and
                  Fanny found, not only that they were getting a reputation for keeping their own
                  little flock in order, but that the nicest children all around were intrusted to
                  their oversight, even by the most careful fathers and mothers. All this pleasure
                  to the children came from the remembrance that "Love is the whole."</p>
               <p>Far from finding themselves a lonely and forsaken family, these boys and girls
                  soon found that they were surrounded with friends. George was quite right in
                  assuming that he could manage the team, and could keep the little farm up, not to
                  its full production under his father, but to a crop large enough to make them
                  comfortable. Every little while there had to be a consultation. Mr. Snyder came
                  down one day to offer him forty dollars a month and his board, if he would go off
                  on a surveying party and carry chain for the engineers. It would be in a good line
                  for promotion. Forty dollars a month to send home to Fanny was a great temptation.
                  And George and Fanny put an extra pine-knot on the fire, after the children had
                  gone to bed, that they might talk it over. But George declined the proposal, with
                  many thanks to Mr. Snyder. He said to him, "that, if he went away, the whole
                  household would be very much weakened. The boys could not carry on the farm alone,
                  and would have to hire out. He thought they were too young for that. After all,
                  Mr. Snyder, 'Love is the whole.'" And Mr. Sydner agreed with him.</p>
               <p>Then, as a few years passed by, after another long council, in which another
                  pine-knot was sacrificed on the hearth, and in which Walter assisted with George
                  and Fanny, it was agreed that Walter should "hire out." He had "a chance," as they
                  said, to go over to the Stacy Brothers, in the next county. Now the Stacy Brothers
                  had the greatest stock farm in all that part of Illinois. They had to hire a great
                  deal of help, and it was a great question to George and Fanny whether poor Walter
                  might not get more harm than good there. But they told Walter perfectly frankly
                  their doubts and their hopes. And he said boldly, "Never you fear<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000126"/> me. Do you think I am such a fool as to forget? Do
                  I not know that 'Love is the whole'? Shall I ever forget who taught us so?" And so
                  it was determined that he should go.</p>
               <p>Yes, and he went. The Stacys' great establishment was different indeed from the
                  little cabin he had left. But the other boys there, and the men he met,
                  Norwegians, Welshmen, Germans, Yankees, all sorts of people, all had hearts just
                  like his heart. And a helpful boy, honest as a clock and brave as St. Paul, who
                  really tried to serve every one as he found opportunity, made friends on the great
                  stock farm just as he had in the corn-room at the end of the wood-house. And once
                  a month, when their wages were paid, he was able to send home the lion's share of
                  his to Fanny, in letters which every month were written a little better, and
                  seemed a little more easy for him to write. And when Thanksgiving came, Mr. George
                  Stacy sent him home for a fortnight, with a special message to his sister, "that
                  he could not do without him, and he wished she would send him a dozen of such
                  boys. He knew how to raise oxen, he said; but would Miss Fanny tell him how she
                  brought up boys like Walter?"</p>
               <p>"I could have told him," said Walter, "but I did not choose to; I could have told
                  him that love was the whole."</p>
               <p>And that story of Walter is only the story of the way in which Ethan also kept up
                  the home tie, and came back, when he got a chance, from his voyages. His voyages
                  were not on the sea. He "hired out" with a canal-boatman. Sometimes they went to
                  the lake, and once they set sail there and came as far as Cleveland. Ethan made a
                  great deal of fun in pretending to tell great sea-stories, like Swiss Family
                  Robinson and Sinbad the Sailor. Fresh-water voyaging has its funny side, as has
                  the deep-sea sailing. But Ethan did not hold to it long. His experience with grain
                  brought him at last to Chicago, and he engaged there in the work of an elevator.
                  But he lived always the old home life. There were three other boys he got
                  acquainted with, one at Mr. Eggleston's church, one at the Custom House, and one
                  at the place where he got his dinner, and they used to come up to his little room
                  in the seventh story of the McKenzie House, and sit on his bed and in his chairs,
                  just as the boys from the blacksmith's came into the corn-room. These four boys
                  made a literary<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6578-00000127"/> club "for reading
                  Shakespeare and the British essayists." Often did they laugh afterwards at its
                  title. They called it the Club of the Tetrarchy, because they thought it grand to
                  have a Greek name. Whatever its name was, it kept them out of mischief. These boys
                  grew up to be four ruling powers in Western life. And when, years after, some one
                  asked Ethan how it was that he had so stanch a friend in Torrey, Ethan told the
                  history of the seventh-story room at the McKenzie House, and he said, "Love is the
                  whole."</p>
               <p>Central in all his life was the little cabin of two rooms and a loft over it.
                  There is no day of his life, from that time to this, of which Fanny cannot tell
                  you the story from his weekly letters home. For though she does not live in the
                  cabin now, she keeps the old letters filed and in order, and once a week steadily
                  Ethan has written to her, and the letters are all sealed now with his own
                  seal-ring, and on the seal-ring is carved the inscription, "Love is the
                  whole."</p>
               <p>I must not try to tell you the story of Alice's fortunes, or Sarah's. Every day of
                  their lives was a romance, as is every day of yours and mine. Every day was a
                  love-story, as may be every day of yours and mine, if we will make it so. As they
                  all grew older their homes were all somewhat parted. The boys became men and
                  married. The girls became women and married. George never pulled down the old
                  farm-house, not even when he and Mr. Vaux built the beautiful house that stands
                  next to it to-day. He put trellises on the sides of it. He trained cotoneaster and
                  Roxbury wax-work over it. He carved a cross himself, and fastened it in the gable.
                  Above the door, as you went in, was a picture of Mary Mother and her Child, with
                  this inscription:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l rend="ti-1">Holy cell and holy shrine,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">For the Maid and Child divine!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Remember, thou that seest her bending</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">O'er that babe upon her knee,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">All heaven is ever thus extending</l>
                        <l rend="ti-2">Its arms of love round thee.</l>
                        <l>Such love shall bless our arched porch;</l>
                        <l>Crowned with his cross, our cot becomes a church."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in that little church he gathered the boys and girls of the neighborhood every
                  Sunday afternoon, and told them stories and they sang together. And on the week
                  days he got up children's parties there, which all the children thought rather the
                  best experiences of the<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6578-00000128"/> week, and he
                  and his wife and his own children grew to think the hours in the cabin the best
                  hours of all. There were pictures on the walls; they painted the windows
                  themselves with flower-pictures, and illuminated them with colored leaves. But
                  there were but two inscriptions. These were over the inside of the two doors, and
                  both inscriptions were the same,—"Love is the whole."</p>
               <p>They told all these stories, and a hundred more, at a great Thanksgiving party
                  after the war. Walter and his wife and his children came from Sangamon County; and
                  the General and all his family came down from Winetka; and Fanny and the Governor
                  and all their seven came all the way from Minnesota; and Alice and her husband and
                  all her little ones came up the river, and so across from Quincy; and Sarah and
                  Gilbert, with the twins and the babies, came in their own carriage all the way
                  from Horace. So there was a Thanksgiving dinner set for all the six, and the six
                  husbands and wives, and the twenty-seven children. In twenty years, since their
                  father died, those brothers and sisters had lived for each other. They had had
                  separate houses, but they had spent the money in them for each other. No one of
                  them had said that anything he had was his own. They had confided wholly each in
                  each. They had passed through much sorrow, and in that sorrow had strengthened
                  each other. They had passed through much joy, and the joy had been multiplied
                  tenfold because it was joy that was shared. At the Thanksgiving they acted the
                  ballad of Lochinvar again, or rather some of the children did. And that set Fanny
                  the oldest and Sarah the youngest to telling to the oldest nephews and nieces some
                  of the stories of the cabin days. But Fanny said, when the children asked for
                  more, "There is no need of any more,—'Love is the whole.'"</p>

               <head>CHRISTMAS AND ROME.</head>
               <p>THE first Christmas this in which a Roman Senate has sat in Rome since the
                  old-fashioned Roman Senates went under,—or since they "went up," if we take the
                  expressive language of our Chicago friends.</p>
               <p>And Pius IX. is celebrating Christmas with an uncomfortable look backward, and an
                  uncomfortable look forward, and an uncomfortable look all around. It is a
                  suggestive matter, this Italian Parliament sitting in Rome. It suggests a good
                  deal of history and a good deal of prophecy.</p>
               <p>"They say" (whoever they may be) that somewhere in Rome there is a range of
                  portraits of popes, running down from never so far back; that only one niche was
                  left in the architecture, which received the portrait of Pius IX., and that then
                  that place was full. Maybe it is so. I did not see the row. But I have heard the
                  story a thousand times. Be it true, be it false, there are, doubtless, many other
                  places where portraits of coming popes could be hung. There is a little wall-room
                  left in the City Hall of New York. There are, also, other palaces in which popes
                  could live. Palaces are as plenty in America as are Pullman cars. But it is
                  possible that there are no such palaces in Rome.</p>
               <p>So this particular Christmas sets one careering back a little, to look at that
                  mysterious connection of Rome with Christianity, which has held on so steadily
                  since the first Christmas got itself put on historical record by a Roman
                  census-maker. Humanly speaking, it was nothing more nor less than a Roman census
                  which makes the word Bethlehem to be a sacred word over all the world to-day. To
                  any person who sees the humorous contrasts of history there is reason for a bit of
                  a smile when he thinks of the way this census came into being, and then remembers
                  what came of it. Here was a consummate movement of Augustus, who would fain have
                  the statistics of his empire. Such excellent things are statistics! "You can prove
                  anything by statistics," says Mr. Canning, "except—the<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000130"/> truth." So Augustus orders his census, and his
                  census is taken. This Quirinus, or Quirinius, pro-consul of Syria, was the first
                  man who took it there, says the Bible. Much appointing of marshals and
                  deputy-marshals,—men good at counting, and good at writing, and good at collecting
                  fees! Doubtless it was a great staff achievement of Quirinus, and made much talk
                  in its time. And it is so well condensed at last and put into tables with indexes
                  and averages as to be very creditable, I will not doubt, to the census bureau. But
                  alas! as time rolls on, things change, so that this very Quirinus, who with all a
                  pro-consul's power took such pains to record for us the number of people there
                  were in Bethlehem and in Judah, would have been clean forgotten himself, and his
                  census too, but that things turned bottom upward. The meanest child born in
                  Bethlehem when this census business was going on happened to prove to be King of
                  the World. It happened that he overthrew the dynasty of Cæsar Augustus, and his
                  temples, and his empire. It happened that everything which was then established
                  tottered and fell, as the star of this child arose. And the child's star did rise.
                  And now this Publius Sulpicius Quirinus or Quirinius,—a great man in his day, for
                  whom Augustus asked for a triumph,—is rescued from complete forgetfulness because
                  that baby happened to be born in Syria when his census was going on!</p>
               <p>I always liked to think that some day when Augustus Cæsar was on a state visit to
                  the Temple of Fortune some attentive clerk handed him down the roll which had just
                  come in and said, "From Syria, your Highness!" that he might have a chance to say
                  something to the Emperor; that the Emperor thanked him, and, in his courtly way,
                  opened the roll so as to seem interested; that his eye caught the words
                  "Bethlehem—village near Jerusalem," and the figures which showed the number of the
                  people and of the children and of all the infants there. Perhaps. No matter if
                  not. Sixty years after, Augustus' successor, Nero, set fire to Rome in a drunken
                  fit. The Temple of Fortune caught the flames, and our roll, with Bethlehem and the
                  count of Joseph's possessions twisted and crackled like any common rag, turned to
                  smoke and ashes, and was gone. That is what such statistics come to!</p>
               <p>Five hundred years after, the whole scene is<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000131"/> changed. The Church of Christ, which for hundreds
                  of years worshipped under-ground in Rome, has found air and sunlight now. It is
                  almost five hundred years after Paul enters Rome as a prisoner, after Nero burned
                  Rome down, that a monk of St. Andrew, one of the more prominent monasteries of the
                  city of Rome, walking through that great market-place of the city—which to this
                  hour preserves most distinctly, perhaps, the memory of what Rome was—saw a party
                  of fair-haired slaves for sale among the rest. He stops to ask where they come
                  from, and of what nation they are; to be told they are "Angli." "Rather Angeli,"
                  says Gregory,—"rather angels;" and with other sacred <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >bon-mots</foreign> he fixes the pretty boys and pretty girls in his memory.
                  Nor are these familiar plays upon words to be spoken of as mere puns. Gregory was
                  determined to attempt the conversion of the land from which these "angels" came.
                  He started on the pilgrimage, which was then a dangerous one; but was recalled by
                  the pope of his day, at the instance of his friends, who could not do without
                  him.</p>
               <p>A few years more and this monk is Bishop of Rome. True to the promise of the
                  marketplace place, he organizes the Christian mission which fulfils his prophecy.
                  He sends Austin with his companions to the island of the fair-haired slave boys;
                  and that new step in the civilization of that land comes, to which we owe it that
                  we are met in this church, nay, that we live in this land this day.</p>
               <p>So far has the star of the baby of Bethlehem risen in a little more than five
                  centuries. A Christian dominion has laid its foundations in the Eternal City. And
                  you and I, gentle reader, are what we are and are where we are because that monk
                  of St. Andrew saw those angel boys that day in a Roman market-place.</p>

               <head>THE SURVIVOR'S STORY.</head>
               <p>FORTUNATELY we were with our wives. It is in general an excellent custom, as I
                  will explain if opportunity is given.</p>
               <p>First, you are thus sure of good company.</p>
               <p>For four mortal hours we had ground along, and stopped and waited and started
                  again, in the drifts between Westfield and Springfield. We had shrieked out our
                  woes by the voices of fire-engines. Brave men had dug. Patient men had sate
                  inside, and waited for the results of the digging. At last, in triumph, at eleven
                  and three-quarters, as they say in Cinderella, we entered the Springfield
                  station.</p>
               <p>It was Christmas eve!</p>
               <p>Leaving the train to its devices, Blatchford and his wife (her name was Sarah),
                  and I with mine (her name was Phebe), walked quickly with our little sacks out of
                  the station, ploughed and waded along the white street, not to the Massasoit,—no,
                  but to the old Eagle and Star, which was still standing, and was a favorite with
                  us youngsters. Good waffles, maple syrup <abbr>ad lib.,</abbr> such fixings of
                  other sorts as we preferred, and some liberty. The amount of liberty in absolutely
                  first-class hotels is but small. A drowsy boy waked, and turned up the gas.
                  Blatchford entered our names on the register, and cried at once, "By George,
                  Wolfgang is here, and Dick! What luck!" for Dick and Wolfgang also travel with
                  their wives. The boy explained that they had come up the river in the New-Haven
                  train, were only nine hours behind time, had arrived at ten, and had just finished
                  supper and gone to bed. We ordered rare beef-steak, waffles, dip-toast, omelettes
                  with kidneys, and omelettes without; we toasted our feet at the open fire in the
                  parlor; we ate the supper when it was ready; and we also went to bed; rejoicing
                  that we had home with us, having travelled with our wives; and that we could keep
                  our merry Christmas here. If only Wolfgang and Dick and their wives would join us,
                  all would be well. (Wolfgang's wife was named Bertha, and Dick's was named<pb
                     n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6578-00000133"/> Hosanna,—a name I have never met with
                  elsewhere.)</p>
               <p>Bed followed; and I am a graceless dog that I do not write a sonnet here on the
                  unbroken slumber that followed. Breakfast, by arrangement of us four, at nine. At
                  9.30, to us enter Bertha, Dick, Hosanna, and Wolfgang, to name them in
                  alphabetical order. Four chairs had been turned down for them. Four chops, four
                  omelettes, and four small oval dishes of fried potatoes had been ordered, and now
                  appeared. Immense shouting, immense kissing among those who had that privilege,
                  general wondering, and great congratulating that our wives were there. Solid
                  resolution that we would advance no farther. Here, and here only, in Springfield
                  itself, would we celebrate our Christmas day.</p>
               <p>It may be remarked in parenthesis that we had learned already that no train had
                  entered the town since eleven and a quarter; and it was known by telegraph that
                  none was within thirty-four miles and a half of the spot, at the moment the vow
                  was made.</p>
               <p>We waded and ploughed our way through the snow to church. I think Mr. Rumfry, if
                  that is the gentleman's name who preached an admirable Christmas sermon, in a
                  beautiful church there is, will remember the platoon of four men and four women,
                  who made perhaps a fifth of his congregation in that storm,—a storm which shut off
                  most church-going. Home again; a jolly fire in the parlor, dry stockings, and dry
                  slippers. Turkeys, and all things fitting for the dinner; and then a general
                  assembly, not in a caravanserai, not in a coffee-room, but in the regular guests'
                  parlor of a New-England second-class hotel, where, as it was ordered, there were
                  no "transients" but ourselves that day; and whence all the "boarders" had gone
                  either to their own rooms, or to other homes.</p>
               <p>For people who have their wives with them, it is not difficult to provide
                  entertainment on such an occasion.</p>
               <p>"Bertha," said Wolfgang, "could you not entertain us with one of your native
                  dances?"</p>
               <p>"Ho! slave," said Dick to Hosanna, "play upon the virginals." And Hosanna played a
                  lively Arab air on the tavern piano, while the fair Bertha danced with a spirit
                  unusual. Was it indeed in memory of the Christmas of her own dear home in
                  Circassia?</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6578-00000134"/>
               <p>All that, from "Bertha" to "Circassia," is not so. We did not do this at all. That
                  was all a slip of the pen. What we did was this. John Blatchford pulled the
                  bell-cord till it broke (they always break in novels, and sometimes they do in
                  taverns). This bell-cord broke. The sleepy boy came; and John said, "Caitiff, is
                  there never a barber in the house?" The frightened boy said there was; and John
                  bade him send him. In a minute the barber appeared,—black, as was expected,—with a
                  shining face, and white teeth, and in shirt sleeves, and broad grins. "Do you tell
                  me, Cæsar," said John, "that in your country they do not wear their coats on
                  Christmas day?"—"Sartin, they do, sir, when they go out doors."</p>
               <p>"Do you tell me, Cæsar," said Dick, "that they have doors in your
                  country?"—"Sartin, they do," said poor Cæsar, flurried.</p>
               <p>"Boy," said I, "the gentlemen are making fun of you. They want to know if you ever
                  keep Christmas in your country without a dance."</p>
               <p>"Never, sar," said poor Cæsar.</p>
               <p>"Do they dance without music?"</p>
               <p>"No, sar; never."</p>
               <p>"Go, then," I said in my sternest accents,—"go fetch a zittern, or a banjo, or a
                  kit, or a hurdy-gurdy, or a fiddle."</p>
               <p>The black boy went, and returned with his violin. And as the light grew gray, and
                  crept into the darkness, and as the darkness gathered more thick and more, he
                  played for us and he played for us, tune after tune; and we danced,—first with
                  precision, then in sport, then in wild holiday frenzy. We began with waltzes,—so
                  great is the convenience of travelling with your wives,—where should we have been,
                  had we been all sole alone, four men? Probably playing whist or euchre. And now we
                  began with waltzes, which passed into polkas, which subsided into round dances;
                  and then in very exhaustion we fell back in a grave quadrille. I danced with
                  Hosanna; Wolfgang and Sarah were our <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis-à-vis.</foreign>
                  We went through the same set that Noah and his three boys danced in the ark with
                  their four wives, and which has been danced ever since, in every moment, on one or
                  another spot of the dry earth, going round it with the sun, like the drumbeat of
                  England,—right and left, first two forward, right hand across, <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">pastorale,</foreign>—the whole series of them;<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000135"/> we did them with as much spirit as if it had been
                  on a flat on the side of Ararat, ground yet too muddy for croquet. Then Blatchford
                  called for "Virginia Reel," and we raced and chased through that. Poor Cæsar began
                  to get exhausted, but a little flip from down stairs helped him amazingly. And,
                  after the flip, Dick cried, "Can you not dance 'Money-Musk'?" And in one wild
                  frenzy of delight we danced "Money-Musk" and "Hull's Victory" and "Dusty Miller"
                  and "Youth's Companion," and "Irish Jigs" on the closet-door lifted off for the
                  occasion, till the men lay on the floor screaming with the fun, and the women fell
                  back on the sofas, fairly faint with laughing.</p>
               <p>All this last, since the sentence after "Circassia," is a mistake. There was not
                  any bell, nor any barber, and we did not dance at all. This was all a slip of my
                  memory.</p>
               <p>What we really did was this:—</p>
               <p>John Blatchford said,—"Let us all tell stories." It was growing dark and he had
                  put more logs on the fire.</p>
               <p>Bertha said,—<q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Heap on more wood, the wind is chill;</l>
                        <l>But let it whistle as it will,</l>

               </p>
               <p>She said that because it was in "Bertha's Visit," a very stupid book which she

                  <p>When I was on the "Tribune," I was despatched to report Mr. Webster's great
                     reply to Hayne. This was in the days of stages. We had to ride from Baltimore
                     to Washington early in the morning to get there in time. I found my boots were
                     gone from my room when the stage-man called me, and I reported that speech in
                     worsted slippers my wife had given me the week before. As we came into
                     Bladensburg it grew light, and I recognized my boots on the<pb n="246-247"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000136"/> feet of my fellow-passenger,—there was but one
                     other man in the stage. I turned to claim them, but stopped in a moment, for it
                     was Webster himself. How serene his face looked as he slept there! He woke
                     soon, passed the time of day, offered me a part of a sandwich,—for we were old
                     friends,—I was counsel against him in the Ogden case. Said Webster to
                     me,—"Steele, I am bothered about this speech: I have a paragraph in it which I
                     cannot word up to my mind." And he repeated it to me. "How would this do?" said
                     he. "'Let us hope that the sense of unrestricted freedom may be so intertwined
                     with the desire to preserve a connection of the several parts of the body
                     politic, that some arrangement, more or less lasting, may prove in a measure
                     satisfactory.' How would that do?"</p>
                  <p>I said I liked the idea, but the expression seemed involved.</p>
                  <p>"And it is involved," said Webster; "but I can't improve it."</p>
                  <p>"How would this do?" said I.</p>
                  <p>"'LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND INSEPARABLE!'"</p>
                  <p>"Capital!" he said, "capital! write that down for me." At that moment we
                     arrived at the Capitol steps. I wrote down the words for him, and from my notes
                     he read them, when that place in the speech came along.</p>
                  <p>All of us applauded the story.</p>

                  <p>You remind me of the impression that very speech made on me, as I heard Henry
                     Chapin deliver it at an exhibition at Leicester Academy. I resolved then that I
                     would free the slave, or perish in the attempt. But how? I, a
                     woman,—disfranchised by the law? Ha! I saw!</p>
                  <p>I went to Arkansas. I opened a "Normal College, or Academy for Teachers." We
                     had balls every second night, to make it popular. Immense numbers came. Half
                     the teachers of the Southern States were trained there. I had admirable
                     instructors in Oil Painting and Music,—the most essential studies. The
                     Arithmetic I taught myself. I taught it well. I achieved fame. I achieved
                     wealth; invested in Arkansas Five per Cents. Only one secret device I
                     persevered in. To all,—old and young, innocent girls and sturdy men,—I so
                     taught the multiplication-table<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6578-00000137"/>
                     plication-table, that one fatal error was hidden in its array of facts. The
                     nine line is the difficult one. I buried the error there. "Nine times six," I
                     taught them, "is fifty-six." The rhyme made it easy. The gilded falsehood
                     passed from lip to lip, from State to State,—one little speck in a chain of
                     golden verity. I retired from teaching. Slowly I watched the growth of the
                     rebellion. At last the aloe blossom shot up,—after its hundred years of
                     waiting. The Southern heart was fired. I brooded over my revenge. I repaired to
                     Richmond. I opened a first-class boarding-house, where all the Cabinet, and
                     most of the Senate, came for their meals; and I had eight permanents. Soon
                     their brows clouded. The first flush of victory passed away. Night after night,
                     they sat over their calculations, which all came wrong. I smiled,—and was a
                     villain! None of their sums would prove. None of their estimates matched the
                     performance! Never a muster-roll that fitted as it should do! And I,—the
                     despised boarding-mistress,—I alone knew why! Often and often, when Memminger
                     has said to me, with an oath, "Why this discordancy in our totals?" have my
                     lips burned to tell the secret! But no! I hid it in my bosom. And when, at
                     last, I saw a black regiment march into Richmond, singing "John Brown," I
                     cried, for the first time in twenty years, "Nine times six is fifty-four;" and
                     gloated in my sweet revenge.</p>

                  <head>THE INSPECTOR OF GAS-METERS' STORY.</head>
                  <p>Mine is a tale of the ingratitude of republics. It is well-nigh thirty years
                     since I was walking by the Owego and Ithaca Railroad,—a crooked road, not then
                     adapted to high speed. Of a sudden I saw that a long cross timber, on a
                     trestle, high above a swamp, had sprung up from its ties. I looked for a spike
                     with which to secure it. I found a stone with which to hammer the spike. But,
                     at this moment, a train approached, down hill. I screamed. They heard! But the
                     engine had no power to stop the heavy train. With the presence of mind of a
                     poet, and the courage of a hero, I flung my own weight on the fatal timber. I
                     would hold it down, or perish. The engine came. The elasticity of the pine
                     timber whirled<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6578-00000138"/> me in the air! But I
                     held on. The tender crossed. Again I was flung in wild gyrations. But I held
                     on. "It is no bed of roses," I said; "but what act of Parliament was there that
                     I should be happy." Three passenger cars, and ten freight cars, as was then the
                     vicious custom of that road, passed me. But I held on, repeating to myself
                     texts of Scripture to give me courage. As the last car passed, I was whirled
                     into the air by the rebound of the rafter. "Heavens!" I said, "if my orbit is a
                     hyperbola, I shall never return to earth." Hastily I estimated its ordinates,
                     and calculated the curve. What bliss! It was a parabola! After a flight of a
                     hundred and seventeen cubits, I landed, head down, in a soft mud-hole.</p>
                  <p>In that train was the young U. S. Grant, on his way to West Point for
                     examination. But for me the armies of the Republic would have had no
                     leader.</p>
                  <p>I pressed my claim, when I asked to be appointed to England. Although no one
                     else wished to go, I alone was forgotten. Such is gratitude with republics!</p>

                  <head>THE WHEELER AND WILSON'S OPERATIVE'S STORY.</head>
                  <p>My father had left the anchorage of Sorrento for a short voyage, if voyage it
                     may be called. Life was young, and this world seemed heaven. The yacht bowled
                     on under close-reefed stay-sails, and all was happy. Suddenly the corsairs
                     seized us: all were slain in my defence; but I,—this fatal gift of beauty bade
                     them spare my life!</p>
                  <p>Why linger on my tale! In the Zenana of the Shah of Persia I found my home.
                     "How escape his eye?" I said; and, fortunately, I remembered that in my
                     reticule I carried one box of F. Kidder's indelible ink. Instantly I applied
                     the liquid in the large bottle to one cheek. Soon as it was dry, I applied that
                     in the small bottle, and sat in the sun one hour. My head ached with the
                     sunlight, but what of that? I was a fright, and I knew all would be well.</p>
                  <p>I was consigned, so soon as my hideous deficiencies were known, to the
                     sewing-room. Then how I sighed for my machine! Alas! it was not there; but I
                     constructed an imitation from<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6578-00000139"/> a
                     cannon-wheel, a coffee-mill, and two nutcrackers. And with this I made the
                     underclothing for the palace and the Zenana.</p>
                  <p>I also vowed revenge. Nor did I doubt one instant how; for in my youth I had
                     read Lucretia Borgia's memoirs, and I had a certain rule for slowly slaying a
                     tyrant at a distance. I was in charge of the shah's own linen. Every week, I
                     set back the buttons on his shirt collars by the width of one thread; or, by
                     arts known to me, I shrunk the binding of the collar by a like proportion.
                     Tighter and tighter with each week did the vice close around his larynx. Week
                     by week, at the high religious festivals, I could see his face was blacker and
                     blacker. At length the hated tyrant died. The leeches called it apoplexy. I did
                     not undeceive them. His guards sacked the palace. I bagged the diamonds, fled
                     with them to Trebizond, and sailed thence in a caïque to South Boston. No more!
                     such memories oppress me.</p>

                  <head>THE CONDUCTOR'S STORY.</head>
                  <p>I was poor. Let this be my excuse, or rather my apology. I entered a Third
                     Avenue car at Thirty-sixth Street, and saw the conductor sleeping. Satan
                     tempted me, and I took from him his badge, 213. I see the hated figures now.
                     When he woke, he knew not he had lost it. The car started, and he walked to the
                     rear. With the badge on my coat, I collected eight fares within, stepped
                     forward, and sprang into the street. Poverty is my only apology for the crime.
                     I concealed myself in a cellar where men were playing with props. Fear is my
                     only excuse. Lest they should suspect me, I joined their game, and my forty
                     cents were soon three dollars and seventy. With these ill-gotten gains, I
                     visited the gold exchange, then open evenings. My superior intelligence enabled
                     me to place well my modest means, and at midnight I had a competence. Let me be
                     a warning to all young men. Since that night, I have never gambled more.</p>
                  <p>I threw the hated badge into the river. I bought a palace on Murray Hill, and
                     led an upright and honorable life. But since that night of terror the sound of
                     the horse-cars oppresses me. Always since, to go up town or down, I order my
                     own coupé, with George to drive me; and never have I entered the cleanly,
                        sweet,<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6578-00000140"/> and airy carriage provided
                     for the public. I cannot; conscience is too much for me. You see in me a
                     monument of crime.</p>
                  <p>I said no more. A moment's pause, a few natural tears, and a single sigh hushed
                     the assembly; then Bertha, with her siren voice, told—</p>

                  <p>At the time you speak of, I was the private governess of two lovely boys,
                     Julius and Pompey,—Pompey the senior of the two. The black-eyed darling! I see
                     him now. I also see, hanging to his neck, his blue-eyed brother, who had given
                     Pompey his black eye the day before. Pompey was generous to a fault; Julius,
                     parsimonious beyond virtue. I therefore instructed them in two different rooms.
                     To Pompey, I read the story of "Waste not, want not." To Julius, on the other
                     hand, I spoke of the All-love of his great Mother Nature, and her profuse gifts
                     to her children. Leaving him with grapes and oranges, I stepped back to Pompey,
                     and taught him how to untie parcels so as to save the string. Leaving him
                     winding the string neatly, I went back to Julius, and gave to him ginger-cakes.
                     The dear boys grew from year to year. They outgrew their knickerbockers, and
                     had trousers. They outgrew their jackets, and became men; and I felt that I had
                     not lived in vain. I had conquered nature. Pompey, the little spendthrift, was
                     the honored cashier of a savings bank, till he ran away with the capital.
                     Julius, the miser, became the chief croupier at the New Crockford's. One of
                     those boys is now in Botany Bay, and the other is in Sierra Leone!</p>
                  <p>"I thought you were going to say in a hotter place," said John Blatchford; and
                     he told his story:—</p>

                  <head>THE STOKER'S STORY.</head>
                  <p>We were crossing the Atlantic in a Cunarder. I was second stoker on the
                     starboard watch. In that horrible gale we spoke of before dinner, the coal was
                     exhausted, and I, as the best-dressed man, was sent up to the captain to ask
                     what we should do. I found him himself at the wheel. He almost cursed me and
                     bade me say nothing of coal, at a moment when he must keep her head to the wind
                     with her full power, or we were lost. He<pb n="256-257"
                        xml:id="VAC6578-00000141"/> bade me slide my hand into his pocket, and take
                     out the key of the after freight-room, open that, and use the contents for
                     fuel. I returned hastily to the engine-room, and we did as we were bid. The
                     room contained nothing but old account books, which made a hot and effective
                     fire.</p>
                  <p>On the third day the captain came down himself into the engine-room, where I
                     had never seen him before, called me aside, and told me that by mistake he had
                     given me the wrong key; asking me if I had used it. I pointed to him the empty
                     room: not a leaf was left. He turned pale with fright. As I saw his emotion he
                     confided to me the truth. The books were the evidences or accounts of the
                     British national debt; of what is familiarly known as the Consolidated Fund, or
                     the "Consols." They had been secretly sent to New York for the examination of
                     James Fiske, who had been asked to advance a few millions on this security to
                     the English Exchequer, and now all evidence of indebtedness was gone!</p>
                  <p>The captain was about to leap into the sea. But I dissuaded him. I told him to
                     say nothing; I would keep his secret; no man else knew it. The Government would
                     never utter it. It was safe in our hands. He reconsidered his purpose. We came
                     safe to port and did—nothing.</p>
                  <p>Only on the first quarter-day which followed, I obtained leave of absence, and
                     visited the Bank of England, to see what happened. At the door was this
                     placard,—"Applicants for dividends will file a written application, with name
                     and amount, at desk A, and proceed in turn to the Paying Teller's Office." I
                     saw their ingenuity. They were making out new books, certain that none would
                     apply but those who were accustomed to. So skilfully do men of Government study
                     human nature.</p>
                  <p>I stepped lightly to one of the public desks. I took one of the blanks. I
                     filled it out, "John Blatchford, ¥1747 6<abbr>s.</abbr> 8<abbr>d.,</abbr>" and
                     handed it in at the open trap. I took my place in the queue in the teller's
                     room. After an agreeable hour, a pile, not thick, of Bank of England notes was
                     given to me; and since that day I have quarterly drawn that amount from the
                     maternal government of that country. As I left the teller's room, I observed
                     the captain in the queue. He was the seventh man from the window, and I have
                     never seen him more.</p>
                  <p>We then asked Hosanna for her story.</p>

                  <head>THE N. E. HISTORICAL GENEALOGIST'S STORY.</head>
                  <p>"My story," said she, "will take us far back into the past. It will be
                     necessary for me to dwell on some incidents in the first settlement of this
                     country, and I propose that we first prepare and enjoy the Christmas-tree.
                     After this, if your courage holds, you shall hear an over-true tale." Pretty
                     creature, how little she knew what was before us!</p>
                  <p>As we had sat listening to the stories, we had been preparing for the tree.
                     Shopping being out of the question, we were fain from our own stores to make up
                     our presents, while the women were arranging nuts, and blown egg-shells, and
                     pop-corn strings from the stores of the "Eagle and Star." The popping of corn
                     in two corn-poppers had gone on through the whole of the story-telling. All
                     being so nearly ready, I called the drowsy boy again, and, showing him a very
                     large stick in the wood-box, asked him to bring me a hatchet. To my great joy
                     he brought the axe of the establishment, and I bade him farewell. How little
                     did he think what was before him! So soon as he had gone I went stealthily down
                     the stairs, and stepping out into the deep snow, in front of the hotel, looked
                     up into the lovely night. The storm had ceased, and I could see far back into
                     the heavens. In the still evening my strokes might have been heard far and
                     wide, as I cut down one of the two pretty Norways that shaded Mr. Pynchon's
                     front walk, next the hotel. I dragged it over the snow. Blatchford and Steele
                     lowered sheets to me from the large parlor window, which I attached to the
                     larger end of the tree. With infinite difficulty they hauled it in. I joined
                     them in the parlor, and soon we had as stately a tree growing there as was in
                     any home of joy that night in the river counties.</p>
                  <p>With swift fingers did our wives adorn it. I should have said above, that we
                     travelled with our wives, and that I would recommend that custom to others. It
                     was impossible, under the circumstances, to maintain much secrecy; but it had
                     been agreed that all who wished to turn their backs to the circle, in the
                     preparation of presents, might do so without offence to the others. As the
                     presents were wrapped, one by one, in paper of different colors, they were
                     marked with the names of giver and receiver, and placed in a large
                     clothes-basket. At last<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6578-00000143"/> all was
                     done. I had wrapped up my knife, my pencil-case, my letter-case, for Steele,
                     Blatchford, and Dick. To my wife I gave my gold watch-key, which fortunately
                     fits her watch; to Hosanna, a mere trifle, a seal ring I wore; to Bertha, my
                     gold chain; and to Sarah Blatchford, the watch which generally hung from it.
                     For a few moments, we retired to our rooms while the pretty Hosanna arranged
                     the forty-nine presents on the tree. Then she clapped her hands, and we rushed
                     in. What a wondrous sight! What a shout of infantine laughter and charming
                     prattle! for in that happy moment were we not all children again?</p>
                  <p>I see my story hurries to its close. Dick, who is the tallest, mounted a
                     step-ladder, and called us by name to receive our presents. I had a nice gold
                     watch-key from Hosanna, a knife from Steele, a letter-case from Phebe, and a
                     pretty pencil-case from Bertha. Dick had given me his watch-chain, which he
                     knew I fancied; Sarah Blatchford, a little toy of a Geneva watch she wore; and
                     her husband, a handsome seal ring, a present to him from the Czar, I believe;
                     Phebe, that is my wife,—for we were travelling with our wives,—had a
                     pencil-case from Steele, a pretty little letter-case from Dick, a watch-key
                     from me, and a French repeater from Blatchford; Sarah Blatchford gave her the
                     knife she carried, with some bright verses, saying that it was not to cut love;
                     Bertha, a watch-chain; and Hosanna a ring of turquoise and amethysts. The other
                     presents were similar articles, and were received, as they were given, with
                     much tender feeling. But at this moment, as Dick was on the top of the flight
                     of steps, handing down a red apple from the tree, a slight catastrophe
                     occurred.</p>
                  <p>The first I was conscious of was the angry hiss of steam. In a moment I
                     perceived that the steam-boiler, from which the tavern was warmed, had
                     exploded. The floor beneath us rose, and we were driven with it through the
                     ceiling and the rooms above,—through an opening in the roof into the still
                     night. Around us in the air were flying all the other contents and occupants of
                     the Star and Eagle. How bitterly was I reminded of Dick's flight from the
                     railroad track of the Ithaca &amp; Owego Railroad! But I could not hope such an
                     escape as his. Still my flight was in a parabola; and, in a period not longer
                     than it has taken to describe<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6578-00000144"/> it, I
                     was thrown senseless, at last, into a deep snow-bank near the United States
                     Arsenal.</p>
                  <p>Tender hands lifted me and assuaged me. Tender teams carried me to the City
                     Hospital. Tender eyes brooded over me. Tender science cared for me. It proved
                     necessary, before I recovered, to amputate my two legs at the hips. My right
                     arm was wholly removed, by a delicate and curious operation, from the socket.
                     We saved the stump of my left arm, which was amputated just below the shoulder.
                     I am still in the hospital to recruit my strength. The doctor does not like to
                     have me occupy my mind at all; but he says there is no harm in my compiling my
                     memoirs, or writing magazine stories. My faithful nurse has laid me on my
                     breast on a pillow, has put a camel's-hair pencil in my mouth, and, feeling
                     almost personally acquainted with John Carter, the artist, I have written out
                     for you, in his method, the story of my last Christmas.</p>
                  <p>I am sorry to say that the others have never been found.</p>

               <head>THE SAME CHRISTMAS IN OLD ENGLAND AND NEW.</head>
               <p>THE first Christmas in New England was celebrated by some people who tried as hard
                  as they could not to celebrate it at all. But looking back on that year 1620, the
                  first year when Christmas was celebrated in New England, I cannot find that
                  anybody got up a better <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fête</foreign> than did these
                  Lincolnshire weavers and ploughmen who had got a little taste of Dutch firmness,
                  and resolved on that particular day, that, whatever else happened to them, they
                  would not celebrate Christmas at all.</p>
               <p>Here is the story as William Bradford tells it:</p>
               <p>"Ye 16. <emph>day</emph> ye winde came faire, and they arrived safe in this
                  harbor. And after wards tooke better view of ye place, and resolved wher to pitch
                  their dwelling; and ye 25. <emph>day</emph> begane<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000145"/> to erecte ye first house for comone use to receive
                  them and their goods."</p>
               <p>You see, dear reader, that when on any 21st or 22d of December you give the
                  children parched corn, and let them pull candy and swim candles in nut-shells in
                  honor of the "landing of the Forefathers"—if by good luck you be of Yankee blood,
                  and do either of these praiseworthy things—you are not celebrating the anniversary
                  of the day when the women and children landed, wrapped up in water-proofs, with
                  the dog and John Carver in headpiece, and morion, as you have seen in many
                  pictures. That all came afterward. Be cool and self-possessed, and I will guide
                  you through the whole chronology safely—Old Style and New Style, first landing and
                  second landing, Sabbaths and Sundays, Carver's landing and Mary Chilton's landing,
                  so that you shall know as much as if you had fifteen ancestors, a cradle, a
                  tankard, and an oak chest in the Mayflower, and you shall come out safely and
                  happily at the first Christmas day.</p>
               <p>Know then, that when the poor Mayflower at last got across the Atlantic,
                  Massachusetts stretched out her right arm to welcome her, and she came to anchor
                  as early as the 11th of November in Provincetown Harbor. This was the day when the
                  compact of the cabin of the Mayflower was signed, when the fiction of the "social
                  compact" was first made real. Here they fitted their shallop, and in this shallop,
                  on the sixth of December, ten of the Pilgrims and six of the ship's crew sailed on
                  their exploration. They came into Plymouth harbor on the tenth, rested on Watson's
                  island on the eleventh,—which was Sunday,—and on Monday, the twelfth, landed on
                  the mainland, stepping on Plymouth rock and marching inland to explore the
                  country. Add now nine days to this date for the difference then existing between
                  Old Style and New Style, and you come upon the twenty-first of December, which is
                  the day you ought to celebrate as Forefathers' Day. On that day give the children
                  parched corn in token of the new provant, the English walnut in token of the old,
                  and send them to bed with Elder Brewster's name, Mary Chilton's, Edward Winslow's,
                  and John Billington's, to dream upon. Observe still that only these ten men have
                  landed. All the women and children and the other men are over in Provincetown
                     harbor.<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6578-00000146"/> These ten, liking the
                  country well enough, go across the bay to Provincetown where they find poor
                  Bradford's wife drowned in their absence, and bring the ship across into Plymouth
                  harbor on the sixteenth. Now you will say of course that they were so glad to get
                  here that they began to build at once; but you are entirely mistaken, for they did
                  not do any such thing. There was a little of the John Bull about them and a little
                  of the Dutchman. The seventeenth was Sunday. Of course they could not build a city
                  on Sunday. Monday they explored, and Tuesday they explored more. Wednesday,</p>
               <p>"After we had called on God for direction, we came to this resolution, to go
                  presently ashore again, and to take a better view of two places, which we thought
                  most fitting for us; for we could not now take time for further search or
                  consideration, our victuals being much spent, especially our beer."</p>
               <p>Observe, this is the Pilgrims' or Forefathers' beer, and not the beer of the ship,
                  of which there was still some store. Acting on this resolution they went ashore
                  again, and concluded by "most voices" to build Plymouth where Plymouth now is. One
                  recommendation seems to have been that there was a good deal of land already
                  clear. But this brought with it the counter difficulty that they had to go half a
                  quarter of a mile for their wood. So there they left twenty people on shore,
                  resolving the next day to come and build their houses. But the next day it
                  stormed, and the people on shore had to come back to the ship, and Richard
                  Britteridge died. And Friday it stormed so that they could not land, and the
                  people on the shallop who had gone ashore the day before could not get back to the
                  ship. Saturday was the twenty-third, as they counted, and some of them got ashore
                  and cut timber and carried it to be ready for building. But they reserved their
                  forces still, and Sunday, the twenty-fourth, no one worked of course. So that when
                  Christmas day came, the day which every man, woman and child of them had been
                  trained to regard as a holy day—as a day specially given to festivity and
                  specially exempted from work, all who could went on shore and joined those who had
                  landed already. So that William Bradford was able to close the first book of his
                  history by saying: "Ye 25. <emph>day</emph> begane to erect ye first house for
                  comone use to receive them and their goods."</p>

               <p>Now, this all may have been accidental. I do not say it was not. But when I come
                  to the record of Christmas for next year and find that Bradford writes: "One ye
                  day called Christmas-day, ye Gov'r caled them out to worke (as was used)," I
                  cannot help thinking that the leaders had a grim feeling of satisfaction in
                  "secularizing" the first Christmas as thoroughly as they did. They wouldn't work
                  on Sunday, and they would work on Christmas.</p>
               <p>They did their best to desecrate Christmas, and they did it by laying one of the
                  corner-stones of an empire.</p>
               <p>Now, if the reader wants to imagine the scene,—the Christmas celebration or the
                  Christmas desecration, he shall call it which he will, according as he is Roman or
                  Puritan himself,—I cannot give him much material to spin his thread from. Here is
                  the little story in the language of the time:</p>
               <p>"Munday the 25. day, we went on shore, some to fell tymber, some to saw, some to
                  riue, and some to carry, so no man rested all that day, but towards night some as
                  they were at worke, heard a noyse of some Indians, which caused vs all to goe to
                  our Muskets, but we heard no further, so we came aboord againe, and left some
                  twentie to keepe the court of gard; that night we had a sore storme of winde and
                  rayne.</p>
               <p>"Munday the 25. being Christmas day, we began to drinke water aboord, but at night
                  the Master caused vs to have some Beere, and so on board we had diverse times now
                  and then some Beere, but on shore none at all."</p>
               <p>There is the story as it is told by the only man who chose to write it down. Let
                  us not at this moment go into an excursus to inquire who he was and who he was
                  not. Only diligent investigation has shown beside that this first house was about
                  twenty feet square, and that it was for their common use to receive them and their
                  goods. The tradition says that it was on the south side of what is now Leyden
                  street, near the declivity of the hill. What it was, I think no one pretends to
                  say absolutely. I am of the mind of a dear friend of mine, who used to say that,
                  in the hardships of those first struggles, these old forefathers of ours, as they
                  gathered round the fires (which they did have—no Christian Registers for them to
                  warm their cold hands by), used to pledge themselves<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000148"/> to each other in solemn vows that they would leave
                  to posterity no detail of the method of their lives. Posterity should not make
                  pictures out of them, or, if it did, should make wrong ones; which accordingly,
                  posterity has done. What was the nature, then, of this twenty-foot-square
                  store-house, in which, afterward, they used to sleep pretty compactly, no man can
                  say. Dr. Young suggests a log cabin, but I do not believe that the log cabin was
                  yet invented. I think it is more likely that the Englishmen rigged their
                  two-handled saws,—after the fashion known to readers of Sanford and Merton in an
                  after age,—and made plank for themselves. The material for imagination, as far as
                  costume goes, may be got from the back of a fifty-dollar national bank-note, which
                  the well-endowed reader will please take from his pocket, or from a roll of
                  Lorillard's tobacco at his side, on which he will find the good reduction of
                  Weir's admirable picture of the embarkation. Or, if the reader has been
                  unsuccessful in his investment in Lorillard, he will find upon the back of the
                  one-dollar bank-note a reduced copy of the fresco of the "Landing" in the Capitol,
                  which will answer his purpose equally well. Forty or fifty Englishmen, in hats and
                  doublets and hose of that fashion, with those odd English axes that you may see in
                  your Æsop's fable illustrations, and with their double-handled saws, with a few
                  beetles, and store of wedges, must make up your tableau, dear reader. Make it
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">vivant,</foreign> if you can.</p>
               <p>To help myself in the matter, I sometimes group them on the bank there just above
                  the brook,—you can see the place to-day, if it will do you any good—at some moment
                  when the women have come ashore to see how the work goes on—and remembering that
                  Mrs. Hemans says "they sang"—I throw the women all in a chorus of soprano and
                  contralto voices on the left, Mrs. Winslow and Mrs. Carver at their head, Mrs. W.
                  as <foreign xml:lang="ITA">prima assoluta soprano</foreign> and Mrs. Carver as
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">prima assoluta contralto,</foreign>—I range on the
                  right the men with W. Bradford and W. Brewster as leaders—and between, facing us,
                  the audience,—who are lower down in the valley of the brook, I place Giovanni
                  Carver (tenor) and Odoardo Winslow (basso) and have them sing in the English
                  dialect of their day, <q>
                     <l>Suoni la tromba,</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6578-00000149"/> Carver waving the red-cross flag of
                  England, and Winslow swinging a broadaxe above his head in similar revolutions.
                  The last time I saw any Puritans doing this at the opera, one had a star-spangled
                  banner and the other an Italian tricolor,—but I am sure my placing on the stage is
                  more accurate than that. But I find it very hard to satisfy myself that this is
                  the correct idealization. Yet Mrs. Hemans says the songs were "songs of lofty
                  cheer," which precisely describes the duet in Puritani.</p>
               <p>It would be an immense satisfaction, if by palimpsest under some old cash-book of
                  that century, or by letters dug out from some family collection in England, one
                  could just discover that "John Billington, having become weary with cutting down a
                  small fir-tree which had been allotted to him, took his snaphance and shot with
                  him, and calling a dog he had, to whom in the Low Countries the name Crab had been
                  given, went after fowle. Crossing the brook and climbing up the bank to an open
                  place which was there, he found what had been left by the savages of one of their
                  gardens,—and on the ground, picking at the stalkes of the corne, a flocke of large
                  blacke birds such as he had never seen before. His dogge ran at them and
                  frightened them, and they all took wing heavily, but not so quick but that
                  Billington let fly at them and brought two of them down,—one quite dead and one
                  hurt so badly that he could not fly. Billington killed them both and tyed them
                  together, and following after the flocke had another shot at them, and by a good
                  Providence hurte three more. He tyed two of these together and brought the
                  smallest back to us, not knowing what he brought, being but a poor man and
                  ignorant. Hee is but a lazy Fellowe, and was sore tired with the weight of his
                  burden, which was nigh fortie pounds. Soe soon as he saw it, the Governour and the
                  rest knew that it was a wild Turkie, and albeit he chid Billington sharply, he
                  sent four men with him, as it were Calebs and Joshuas, to bring in these
                  firstlings of the land. They found the two first and brought them to us; but after
                  a long search they could not find the others, and soe gave them up, saying the
                  wolves must have eaten them. There were some that thought John Billington had
                  never seen them either, but had shot them with a long bowe. Be this as it may,
                  Mistress Winslow and the other<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6578-00000150"/> women
                  stripped them they had, cleaned them, spytted them, basted them, and roasted them,
                  and thus we had fresh foule to our dinner."</p>
               <p>I say it would have been very pleasant to have found this in some palimpsest, but
                  if it is in the palimpsest, it has not yet been found. As the Arab proverb says,
                  "There is news, but it has not yet come."</p>
               <p>I have failed, in just the same way, to find a letter from that rosy-cheeked
                  little child you see in Sargent's picture, looking out of her great wondering
                  eyes, under her warm hood, into the desert. I overhauled a good many of the Cotton
                  manuscripts in the British Museum (Otho and Caligula, if anybody else wants to
                  look), and Mr. Sainsbury let me look through all the portfolios I wanted in the
                  State Paper Office, and I am sure the letter was not there then. If anybody has
                  found it, it has been found since I was there. If it ever is found, I should like
                  to have it contain the following statement:—</p>
               <p>"We got tired of playing by the fire, and so some of us ran down to the brook, and
                  walked till we could find a place to cross it; and so came up to a meadow as large
                  as the common place in Leyden. There was a good deal of ice upon it in some
                  places, but in some places behind, where there were bushes, we found good store of
                  berries growing on the ground. I filled my apron, and William took off his jerkin
                  and made a bag of it, and we all filled it to carry up to the fire. But they were
                  so sour, that they puckered our mouths sadly. But my mother said they were
                  cranberries, but not like your cranberries in Lincolnshire. And, having some honey
                  in one of the logs the men cut down, she boiled the cranberries and the honey
                  together, and after it was cold we had it with our dinner. And besides, there were
                  some great pompions which the men had brought with them from the first place we
                  landed at, which were not like Cinderella's, but had long tails to them, and of
                  these my mother and Mrs. Brewster and Mrs. Warren, made pies for dinner. We found
                  afterwards that the Indians called these pompions, <hi rend="i"/>askuta
                  squash."</p>
               <p>But this letter, I am sorry to say, has not yet been found.</p>
               <p>Whether they had roast turkey for Christmas I do not know. I do know, thanks to
                  the recent discovery of the old Bradford manuscript<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000151"/> script, that they did have roast turkey at their
                  first Thanksgiving. The veritable history, like so much more of it, alas! is the
                  history of what they had not, instead of the history of what they had. Not only
                  did they work on the day when all their countrymen played, but they had only water
                  to drink on the day when all their countrymen drank beer. This deprivation of beer
                  is a trial spoken of more than once; and, as lately as 1824, Mr. Everett, in his
                  Pilgrim oration, brought it in high up in the climax of the catalogue of their
                  hardships. How many of us in our school declamations have stood on one leg, as
                  bidden in "Lovell's Speaker," raised the hand of the other side to an angle of
                  forty-five degrees, as also bidden, and repeated, as also bidden, not to say
                  compelled, the words, "I see them, escaped from these perils, pursuing their
                  almost desperate undertaking, and landed at last, after a five-months' passage, on
                  the ice-clad rocks of Plymouth, weak and exhausted from the voyage, poorly armed,
                  scantily provisioned, depending on the charity of their ship-master for a draught
                  of beer on board, drinking nothing but water on shore, without shelter, without
                  means, surrounded by hostile tribes."</p>
               <p>Little did these men of 1620 think that the time would come when ships would go
                  round the world without a can of beer on board; that armies would fight through
                  years of war without a ration of beer or of spirit, and that the builders of the
                  Lawrences and Vinelands, the pioneer towns of a new Christian civilization, would
                  put the condition into the title-deeds of their property that nothing should be
                  sold there which could intoxicate the buyer. Poor fellows! they missed the beer, I
                  am afraid, more than they did the play at Christmas; and as they had not yet
                  learned how good water is for a steady drink, the carnal mind almost rejoices that
                  when they got on board that Christmas night, the curmudgeon ship-master, warmed up
                  by his Christmas jollifications, for he had no scruples, treated to beer all
                  round, as the reader has seen. With that tankard of beer—as those who went on
                  board filled it, passed it, and refilled it—ends the history of the first
                  Christmas in New England.</p>
               <p>It is a very short story, and yet it is the longest history of that Christmas that
                  I have been able to find. I wanted to compare this<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000152"/> celebration of Christmas, grimly intended for its
                  desecration, with some of the celebrations which were got up with painstaking
                  intention. But, alas, pageants leave little history, after the lights have smoked
                  out, and the hangings have been taken away. Leaving, for the moment, King James's
                  Christmas and Englishmen, I thought it would be a pleasant thing to study the
                  contrast of a Christmas in the countries where they say Christmas has its most
                  enthusiastic welcome. So I studied up the war in the Palatinate,—I went into the
                  chronicles of Spain, where I thought they would take pains about Christmas,—I
                  tried what the men of "la religion," the Huguenots, were doing at Rochelle, where
                  a great assembly was gathering. But Christmas day would not appear in memoirs or
                  annals. I tried Rome and the Pope, but he was dying, like the King of Spain, and
                  had not, I think, much heart for pageantry. I looked in at Vienna, where they had
                  all been terribly frightened by Bethlem Gabor, who was a great Transylvanian
                  prince of those days, a sort of successful Kossuth, giving much hope to
                  beleaguered Protestants farther west, who, I believe, thought for a time that he
                  was some sort of seal or trumpet, which, however, he did not prove to be. At this
                  moment of time he was retreating I am afraid, and at all events did not set his
                  historiographer to work describing his Christmas festivities.</p>
               <p>Passing by Bethlem Gabor then, and the rest, from mere failure of their chronicles
                  to make note of this Christmas as it passed, I returned to France in my quest.
                  Louis XIII. was at this time reigning with the assistance of Luynes, the
                  short-lived favorite who preceded Richelieu. Or it would, perhaps, be more proper
                  to say that Luynes was reigning under the name of Louis XIII. Louis XIII. had been
                  spending the year in great activity, deceiving, thwarting, and undoing the
                  Protestants of France. He had made a rapid march into their country, and had
                  spread terror before him. He had had mass celebrated in Navarreux, where it had
                  not been seen or heard in fifty years. With Bethlem Gabor in the ablative,—with
                  the Palatinate quite in the vocative,—these poor Huguenots here outwitted and
                  outgeneralled, and Brewster and Carver freezing out there in America, the Reformed
                  Religion seems in a bad way to one looking at that Christmas. From his triumphal
                  and almost<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6578-00000153"/> bloodless campaign, King
                  Louis returns to Paris, "and there," says Bassompierre, "he celebrated the
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fêtes</foreign> this Christmas." So I thought I was
                  going to find in the memoirs of some gentleman at court, or unoccupied mistress of
                  the robes, an account of what the most Christian King was doing, while the
                  blisters were forming on John Carver's hands, and while John Billington was, or
                  was not, shooting wild turkeys on that eventful Christmas day.</p>
               <p>But I reckoned without my king. For this is all a mistake, and whatever else is
                  certain, it seems to be certain that King Louis XIII. did not keep either
                  Christmas in Paris, either the Christmas of the Old Style, or that of the New.
                  Such, alas, is history, dear friend! When you read in to-night's "Evening Post"
                  that your friend Dalrymple is appointed Minister to Russia, where he has been so
                  anxious to go, do not suppose he will make you his Secretary of Legation. Alas!
                  no; for you will read in to-morrow's "Times" that it was all a mistake of the
                  telegraph, and that the dispatch should have read "O'Shaughnessy," where the
                  dispatch looked like "Dalrymple." So here, as I whetted my pencil, wetted my lips,
                  and drove the attentive librarian at the Astor almost frantic as I sent him up
                  stairs for you five times more, it proved that Louis XIII. did not spend Christmas
                  in Paris, but that Bassompierre, who said so, was a vile deceiver. Here is the
                  truth in the <title xml:lang="FRA">Mercure Française,</title>—flattering and
                  obsequious Annual Register of those days:</p>
               <p>"The King at the end of this year, visited the frontiers of Picardy. In this whole
                  journey, which lasted from the 14th of December to the 12th of January (New
                  Style), the weather was bad, and those in his Majesty's suite found the roads
                  bad." Change the style back to the way our Puritans counted it, and observe that
                  on the same days, the 5th of December to the 3d of January, Old Style, those in
                  the suite of John Carver found the weather bad and the roads worse. Let us
                  devoutly hope that his most Christian Majesty did not find the roads as bad as his

               <p>"And the King," continues the <title xml:lang="FRA">Mercure,</title> "sent an
                  extraordinary Ambassador to the King of Great Britain, at London, the Marshal
                  Cadenet" (brother of the favorite Luynes). "He departed from Calais on Friday, the
                  first day of January, very well accompanied by <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >noblesse.</foreign>
                  <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6578-00000154"/> He arrived at Dover the same evening,
                  and did not depart from Dover until the Monday after."</p>
               <p>Be pleased to note, dear reader, that this Monday, when this Ambassador of a most
                  Christian King departs from Dover, is on Monday the 25th day of December, of Old
                  Style, or Protestant Style, when John Carver is learning woodcutting, by way of
                  encouraging the others. Let us leave the King of France to his bad roads, and
                  follow the fortunes of the favorite's brother, for we must study an English
                  Christmas after all. We have seen the Christmas holidays of men who had hard times
                  for the reward of their faith in the Star of Bethlehem. Let us try the fortunes of
                  the most Christian King's people, as they keep their second Christmas of the year
                  among a Protestant people. Observe that a week after their own Christmas of New
                  Style, they land in Old Style England, where Christmas has not yet begun. Here is
                  the <title xml:lang="FRA">Mercure Français's</title> account of the Christmas
                  holidays,—flattering and obsequious, as I said:</p>
               <p>"Marshal Cadenet did not depart from Dover till the Monday after" (Christmas day,
                  O. S.). "The English Master of Ceremonies had sent twenty carriages and three
                  hundred horses for his suite." (If only we could have ten of the worst of them at
                  Plymouth! They would have drawn our logs for us that half quarter of a mile. But
                  we were not born in the purple!) "He slept at Canterbury, where the Grand
                  Seneschal of England, well accompanied by English noblemen, received him on the
                  part of the King of England. Wherever he passed, the officers of the cities made
                  addresses to him, and offers, even ordering their own archers to march before him
                  and guard his lodgings. When he came to Gravesend, the Earl of Arundel visited him
                  on the part of the King, and led him to the Royal barge. His whole suite entered
                  into twenty-five other barges, painted, hung with tapestry, and well adorned"
                  (think of our poor, rusty shallop there in Plymouth bay), "in which, ascending the
                  Thames, they arrived in London Friday the 29th December" (January 8th, N. S.). "On
                  disembarking, the Ambassador was led by the Earl of Arundel to the palace of the
                  late Queen, which had been superbly and magnificently arranged for him. The day
                  was spent in visits on the part of his Majesty the King of Great Britain, of the
                  Prince of Wales, his son, and of the ambassadors of kings and princes, residing
                     in<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6578-00000155"/> London." So splendidly was he
                  entertained, that they write that on the day of his reception he had four tables,
                  with fifty covers each, and that the Duke of Lennox, Grand Master of England,
                  served them with magnificent order.</p>
               <p>"The following Sunday" (which we could not spend on shore), "he was conducted to
                  an audience by the Marquis of Buckingham," (for shame, Jamie! an audience on
                  Sunday! what would John Knox have said to that!) "where the French and English
                  nobility were dressed as for a great feast day. The whole audience was conducted
                  with great respect, honor, and ceremony. The same evening, the King of Great
                  Britain sent for the Marshal by the Marquis of Buckingham and the Duke of Lennox;
                  and his Majesty and the Ambassador remained alone for more than two hours, without
                  any third person hearing what they said. The following days were all receptions,
                  banquets, visits, and hunting-parties, till the embassy departed."</p>
               <p>That is the way history gets written by a flattering and obsequious court editor
                  or organ at the time. That is the way, then, that the dread sovereign of John
                  Carver and Edward Winslow spent his Christmas holidays, while they were spending
                  theirs in beginning for him an empire. Dear old William Brewster used to be a
                  servant of Davison's in the days of good Queen Bess. As he blows his fingers there
                  in the twenty-foot storehouse before it is roofed, does he tell the rest sometimes
                  of the old wassail at court, and the Christmas when the Earl of Southampton
                  brought Will. Shakespeare in? Perhaps those things are too gay,—at all events, we
                  have as much fuel here as they have at St. James's.</p>
               <p>Of this precious embassy, dear reader, there is not a word, I think, in Hume, or
                  Lingard, or the "Pictorial"—still less, if possible, in the abridgments. Would you
                  like, perhaps, after this truly elegant account thus given by a court editor, to
                  look behind the canvas and see the rough ends of the worsted? I always like to. It
                  helps me to understand my morning "Advertiser" or my "Evening Post," as I read the
                  editorial history of to-day. If you please, we will begin in the Domestic State
                  Papers of England, which the good sense of somebody, I believe kind Sir Francis
                  Palgrave, has had opened for you and me and the rest of us.</p>
               <p>Here is the first notice of the embassy:</p>
               <p>Dec. 13. Letter from Sir Robert Naunton<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6578-00000156"/>
                  to Sir George Calvert. "The King of France is expected at Calais. The Marshal of
                  Cadenet is to be sent over to calumniate those of the religion (that is, the
                  Protestants), and to propose Madme. Henriette for the Prince."</p>
               <p>So they knew, it seems, ten days before we started, what we were coming for.</p>
               <p>Dec. 22. John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton. "In spite of penury, there is to
                  be a masque at Court this Christmas. The King is coming in from Theobalds to
                  receive the French Ambassador, Marshal Cadenet, who comes with a suite of 400 or
                  500."</p>
               <p>What was this masque? Could not Mr. Payne Collier find up the libretto, perhaps?
                  Was it Faith, Valor, Hope, and Love, founding a kingdom, perhaps? Faith with a
                  broadaxe, Valor and Hope with a two-handled saw, while Love dug post-holes and set
                  up timbers? Or was it a less appropriate masque of King James' devising?</p>
               <p>Dec. 25. This is our day. Francis Willisfourd, Governor of Dover Castle to Lord
                  Zouch, Warden of the Cinque Ports. "A French Ambassador has landed with a great
                  train. I have not fired a salute, having no instructions, and declined showing
                  them the fortress. They are entertained as well as the town can afford."</p>
               <p>Observe, we are a little surly. We do not like the French King very well, our own
                  King's daughter being in such straits yonder in the Palatinate. What do these
                  Papists here?</p>
               <p>That is the only letter written on Christmas day in the English "Domestic
                  Archives" for that year! Christmas is for frolic here, not for letter-writing, nor
                  house-building, if one's houses be only built already!</p>
               <p>But on the 27th, Wednesday, "Lord Arundel has gone to meet the French Ambassador
                  at Gravesend." And a very pretty time it seems they had at Gravesend, when you
                  look on the back of the embroidery. Arundel called on Cadenet at his lodgings, and
                  Cadenet did not meet him till he came to the stair—head of his chamber-door—nor
                  did he accompany him further when he left. But Arundel was even with him the next
                  morning. He appointed his meeting for the return call <emph>in the street;</emph>
                  and when the barges had come up to Somerset House, where the party was to stay,
                  Arundel left the Ambassador, telling him that there were gentlemen who would show
                  him his lodging. The<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6578-00000157"/> King was so angry
                  that he made Cadenet apologize. Alas for the Court of Governor John Carver on this
                  side,—four days old to-day—if Massasoit should send us an ambassador!
                     <emph>We</emph> shall have to receive him in the street, unless he likes to
                  come into a palace without a roof! But, fortunately, he does not send till we are
                  ready!</p>
               <p>The Domestic Archives give another glimpse:</p>
               <p>Dec. 30. Thomas Locke to Carleton: "The French Ambassador has arrived at Somerset
                  House with a train so large that some of the seats at Westminster Hall had to be
                  pulled down to make room at their audience." And in letters from the same to the
                  same, of January 7, are accounts of entertainments given to the Ambassador at his
                  first audience (on that Sunday), on the 4th at Parliament House, on the 6th at a
                  masque at Whitehall, where none were allowed below the rank of a Baron—and at Lord
                  Doncaster's entertainment—where "six thousand ounces of gold are set out as a
                  present," says the letter, but this I do not believe. At the Hampton
                  entertainment, and at the masque there were some disputes about precedency, says
                  John Chamberlain in another letter. Dear John Chamberlain, where are there not
                  such disputes? At the masque at Whitehall he says, "a Puritan was flouted and
                  abused, which was thought unseemly, considering the state of the French
                  Protestants." Let the Marshal come over to Gov. John Carver's court and see one of
                  our masques there, if he wants to know about Puritans. "At Lord Doncaster's house
                  the feast cost three thousand pounds, beside three hundred pounds worth of
                  ambergris used in the cooking," nothing about that six thousand ounces of gold.
                  "The Ambassador had a long private interview with the king; it is thought he
                  proposed Mad. Henriette for the Prince. He left with a present of a rich jewel. He
                  requested liberation of all the imprisoned priests in the three kingdoms, but the
                  answer is not yet given."</p>
               <p>By the eleventh of January the embassy had gone, and Thomas Locke says Cadenet
                  "received a round answer about the Protestants." Let us hope it was so, for it was
                  nearly the last, as it was. Thomas Murray writes that he "proposed a match with
                  France,—a confederation against Spanish power, and asked his Majesty to abandon
                  the rebellious princes,—but he refused unless they might have toleration." The<pb
                     n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6578-00000158"/> Ambassador was followed to Rochester
                  for the debts of some of his train,—but got well home to Paris and New Style.</p>
               <p>And so he vanishes from English history.</p>
               <p>His king made him Duke of Chaulnes and Peer of France, but his brother, the
                  favorite died soon after, either of a purple fever or of a broken heart, and
                  neither of them need trouble us more.</p>
               <p>At the moment the whole embassy seemed a failure in England,—and so it is spoken
                  of by all the English writers of the time whom I have seen. "There is a flaunting
                  French Ambassador come over lately," says Howel, "and I believe his errand is
                  naught else but compliment. He had an audience two days since, where he, with his
                  train of ruffling long-haired Monsieurs, carried himself in such a light garb,
                  that after the audience the king asked my Lord Keeper Bacon what he thought of the
                  French Ambassador. He answered, that he was a tall, proper man. 'Aye,' his Majesty
                  replied, 'but what think you of his head-piece? Is he a proper man for the office
                  of an ambassador?' 'Sir,' said Bacon, 'tall men are like houses of four or five
                  stories, wherein commonly the uppermost room is worst furnished.'"</p>
               <p>Hard, this, on us poor six-footers. One need not turn to the biography after this,
                  to guess that the philosopher was five feet four.</p>
               <p>I think there was a breeze, and a cold one, all the time, between the embassy and
                  the English courtiers. I could tell you a good many stories to show this, but I
                  would give them all for one anecdote of what Edward Winslow said to Madam Carver
                  on Christmas evening. They thought it all naught because they did not know what
                  would come of it. We do know.</p>
               <p>And I wish you to observe, all the time, beloved reader, whom I press to my heart
                  for your steadiness in perusing so far, and to whom I would give a jewel had I one
                  worthy to give, in token of my consideration (how you would like a Royalston beryl
                  or an Attleboro topaz).<ref rend="super" target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002"
                     >*</ref>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>Mrs. Hemans says they did not seek "bright jewels of the mine," which was
                        fortunate, as they would not have found them. Attleboro is near Plymouth
                        Rock, but its jewels are not from mines. The beryls of Royalston are, but
                        they are far away. Other good mined jewels, I think, New England has none.
                        Her garnets are poor, and I have yet seen no good amethysts.</p>
                  </note>
                  <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6578-00000159"/> I wish you to observe, I say, that on
                  the Christmas tide, when the Forefathers began New England, Charles and Henrietta
                  were first proposed to each other for that fatal union. Charles, who was to be
                  Charles the First, and Henrietta, who was to be mother of Charles the Second, and
                  James the Second. So this was the time, when were first proposed all the precious
                  intrigues and devisings, which led to Charles the Second, James the Second, James
                  the Third, so called, and our poor friend the Pretender. Civil
                  war—Revolution—1715—1745—Preston-Pans, Falkirk and Culloden—all are in the
                  dispatches Cadenet carries ashore at Dover, while we are hewing our timbers at the
                  side of the brook at Plymouth, and making our contribution to Protestant
                  America.</p>
               <p>On the one side Christmas is celebrated by fifty outcasts chopping wood for their
                  fires—and out of the celebration springs an empire. On the other side it is
                  celebrated by the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">noblesse</foreign> of two nations and
                  the pomp of two courts. And out of the celebration spring two civil wars, the
                  execution of one king and the exile of another, the downfall twice repeated of the
                  royal house, which came to the English throne under fairer auspices than ever. The
                  whole as we look at it is the tale of ruin. Those are the only two Christmas
                  celebrations of that year that I have found anywhere written down!</p>
               <p>You will not misunderstand the moral, dear reader, if, indeed, you exist; if at
                  this point there be any reader beside him who corrects the proof! Sublime thought
                  of the solemn silence in which these words may be spoken! You will not
                  misunderstand the moral. It is not that it is better to work on Christmas than to
                  play. It is not that masques turn out ill, and that those who will not celebrate
                  the great anniversaries turn out well. God forbid!</p>
               <p>It is that these men builded better than they knew, because they did with all
                  their heart and all their soul the best thing that they knew. They loved Christ
                  and feared God, and on Christmas day did their best to express the love and the
                  fear. And King James and Cadenet,—did they love Christ and fear God? I do not
                  know. But I do not believe, nor do you, that the masque of the one, or the embassy
                  of the other, expressed the love, or the hope, or the faith of either!</p>
               <p>So it was that John Carver and his men, trying<pb n="294-295 (Advertisement) "
                     xml:id="VAC6578-00000160"/> ing to avoid the celebration of the day, built
                  better than they knew indeed, and, in their faith, laid a corner-stone for an
                  empire.</p>
               <p>And James and Cadenet trying to serve themselves—forgetful of the spirit of the
                  day, as they pretended to honor it—were so successful that they destroyed a
                  dynasty.</p>
               <p>There is moral enough for our truer Christmas holidays as 1867 leads in the
                  new-born sister.</p>

                  less than two years he has brought out four works, various in their scope as well
                  as in their treatment, and all are excellent in their way. The first was what may
                  be called a philosophic novel; the second a volume of notes and aphorisms; the
                  third a series of "conversations on war and culture;" whilst the fourth, now
                  before us, deals with no less a subject than Government Mr. Helps seeks not to
                  found a science of politics, but to state and to illustrate certain ethical maxims
                  bearing upon the administrative functions of a Government, and especially of the
                  British Government. The lounger who is fond of investigating the springs of human
                  action will find much to amuse him in the remarks of an acute and genial observer
                  of human nature, whilst the man of action will derive profit from his shrewd hints
                  and sage warnings.</item>
               <item>A SHADOW OF DANTE. Being an Essay towards studying Himself, his World, and his
                  Pilgrimage. By MARIA FRANCESCA ROSSETTI. With Illustrations. One volume, crown
                  8vo. Price $2.50. <bibl>From the London Daily Telegraph.</bibl> Miss Rossetti's
                  "Shadow of Dante" is the work of an accomplished and lofty artist. She knows,
                  understands, and loves the great Italian poet, as the wisest and best of English
                  critics have known Shakespeare. The aim of the book is to help English readers to
                  understand the main drift of Dante's wondrous poem as a whole, as well as to
                  gather a minuter and more accurate knowledge of its separate parts. The author
                  would have them know the poet himself, the world of his poem, and his pilgrimage;
                  each of which points she illustrates by extracts from well-known and famous
                  translations, as well as by a series of acute and masterly criticisms, which none
                  but a scholar and a poet could have written, but which all true scholars and
                  poets, as well as mere learners, will admire and gratefully appreciate. Mr.
                  Longfellow's verse is well known for the beauty and accuracy of many of its
                  passages, but the prose commentary of Miss Rossetti is even more vivid and more
                  admirable. As a guide-book, a commentary, and an exposition of Dante's great poem,
                  Miss Rossetti's work stands alone. There is not only no book in English so good as
                  this, but, as far as we are aware, no book of the same kind or cast of
                  thought.</item>

                  <bibl>From the Literary World.</bibl> "The first novel from the pen of one of the
                  most popular poets of the age—written, too, in the author's maturity, when her
                  name is almost exclusively associated with verse, so far as literature is
                  concerned, and therefore to be regarded as a deliberate work, and one in which she
                  challenges the decisive judgment of the public—will be read with universal and
                  eager interest. We have read this book with constantly increasing pleasure. It is
                  a novel with a soul in it, that imparts to the reader an influence superior to
                  mere momentary entertainment; it is not didactic, but it teaches; it is genuine,
                  fresh, healthy, presents cheerful views of life, and exalts nobility of character
                  without seeming to do so."</p>
               <p>Extract from a private letter,—not intended for publication,—the hearty opinion of
                  one of the most popular and favorite writers of the present day:— <q>
                     <p>"Thanks for the book. I sat up nearly all night to read it, and think it
                        very charming I hope she will soon write again; for we need just such
                        simple, pure, and cheerful stories here in America, where even the nursery
                        songs are sensational, and the beautiful old books we used to love are now
                        called dull and slow. I shall sing its praises loud and long, and set all my
                        boys and girls to reading 'Off the Skelligs,' sure that they will learn to
                        love it as well as they do her charming Songs. If I could reach so far, I
                        should love to shake hands with Miss Ingelow, and thank her heartily for
                        this delightful book."</p>

               </p>
               <p>A collection of fugitive tales and sketches which we should have been sorry to
                  lose. Miss Alcott's boys and girls are always delightful in her hands. She throws
                  a loving glamour over them; and she loves them herself so heartily that it is not
                  possible for the reader to do otherwise. We have found the book very pleasant to
                  read.</p>
               <p>
                  <bibl>From the New York Tribune.</bibl> The large and increasing circle of
                  juveniles who sit enchanted year in and out round the knees of Miss Alcott will
                  hail with delight the publication of "Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag." The most taking of
                  these taking tales is, to our fancy, "My Boys;" but all possess the quality which
                  made "Little Women" so widely popular, and the book will be welcomed and read from
                  Maine to Florida.</p>
               <p>
                  <bibl>Mrs. Hale, in Godey's Lady's Book.</bibl> These little stories are in every
                  way worthy of the author of "Little Women." They will be read with the sincerest
                  pleasure by thousands of children, and in that pleasure there will not be a single
                  forbidden ingredient. "My Boys," which, opening upon by chance, we read through at
                  a sitting, is charming. Ladislas, the noble, sweet-tempered Pole, is the original
                  of Laurie, ever to be remembered by all "Aunt Jo's" readers.</p>
               <p>
                  <bibl>From the Providence Press.</bibl> Dear Aunt Jo! You are embalmed in the
                  thoughts and loves of thousands of little men and little women. Your scrap-bag is
                  rich in its stores of good things. Pray do not close and put it away quite
                  yet.</p>
               <p>This is Louisa Alcott's Christmas tribute to the young people, and it is, like
                  herself, <emph>good.</emph> In making selections, "Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag" must not
                  be forgotten. There will be a vacant place where this little volume is not.</p>

               <head>THE DOLL-WORLD SERIES.</head>
               <head>BY MRS. ROBERT O'REILLY.</head>
               <p>Comprising "Doll World," "Deborah's Drawer," and "Daisy's Companions."</p>
               <p>Three beautiful volumes, illustrated and bound in cloth, black and gilt lettered,
                  and put up in a neat box. Price $3.00: or, separately, $1.00 each.</p>
               <p>
                  <bibl>From the Boston Daily Advertiser.</bibl> One rarely meets with three so
                  thoroughly charming and satisfactory books for children as the "Doll-World
                  Series," by Mrs. Robert O'Reilly. Their author seems to possess—and in a high
                  degree—every one of the very peculiar and varied characteristics which fit one to
                  be a good writer for the young. She is humorous,—one ought perhaps to say funny,
                  for that is the word which the children understand best; and Mrs. O'Reilly's wit
                  is not the sly satire which appeals in a kind of aside to the adults present, but
                  the bubbling merriment which is addressed directly to the ready risibles of her
                  proper audience. She is pathetic also, with the keen, transitory pathos which
                  belongs to childhood, a pathos never too much elaborated or too distressingly
                  prolonged. She is abundantly dramatic. Her stories are full of action. Her
                  incidents, though never forced or unnatural, are almost all picturesque, and they
                  succeed one another rapidly.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless we have not yet noted Mrs. O'Reilly's chief excellence as a
                  story-writer, nor is it easy to find a single word to express that admirable
                  quality. We come nearest it, perhaps, when we say that her tales have absolute
                     <emph>reality;</emph> there is in them no suggestion of being made up, no
                  visible composition. The illusion of her pictures is so perfect that it is not
                  illusion. This <emph>note</emph> of reality, which ought to be prevalent in any
                  romance, is positively indispensable in a juvenile one, and it is perfectly
                  delivered by one only of our native writers of children's books. That one is of
                  course Miss Alcott. Her "Little Women" are as real as Daisy Grey and Bessie
                  Somers; the "Little Men" very nearly so. We have other writers who approach Miss
                  Alcott, more or less closely: Mrs. Walker, Aunt Fanny, Susan Coolidge in the more
                  realistic parts of the "New Year's Bargain;" and indeed the latter writer comes so
                  near <emph>truth,</emph> and is also so like the author of the "Doll World"
                  stories in the quality of her talent, that one hopes her next essay may be
                  absolutely successful in this regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <bibl>From the New York Tribune.</bibl> The pretty edition of Mrs. Robert
                  O'Reilly's works, just issued by Messrs. Roberts Brothers, will be welcome to a
                  throng of juvenile readers as the first gift-book of the autumn. It is hard to say
                  which of the three charming volumes comprised in this series will be most liked at
                  the nursery hearth. We fancy "Doll World" appeals most tenderly to the affections
                  of little matrons with baby-houses and families of wood and wax to care for;
                  though "Deborah's Drawer," with its graceful interlinking of story with story, is
                  sure to be the elected favorite of many. Our own preference is for "Daisy's
                  Companions," and this for a reason less comprehensible to children than to older
                  people; namely, that the story closes, leaving the characters in the midst of
                  their childish lives, and without hint of further fate or development.</p>
               <p>There are few books for children which we can recommend so thoroughly and so
                  heartily as hers. And as one of our wise men has told us that "there is a want of
                  principle in making amusements for children dear," Messrs. Roberts Brothers
                  deserve thanks for giving us these volumes in a form at once so tasteful and so
                  inexpensive.</p>
