            <p>THE Sketches which comprise this volume were written in such intervals of "leisure" as could be stolen during the past five years, when duty permitted absence from the editorial rooms of a daily newspaper.</p> 
            <p>The critic will find them variable in style, and unequal in merit; but if he will only accord, what the Author designs, in each-"to point a moral"-he may use his scalpel playfully, or keenly, or, what is severer, not at all, and "damn the book with faint praise," he will, in no degree, produce such effects as, it is said, broke the heart of poor Keats, or which, according to history, brought out Byron's "English Bards and Scotch Reviewers."</p>

               <head>EASY WARREN.</head> 
               <p>RAYMOND WARREN was a "nice" man-every body's clever fellow, as I heard a public man once remark, "a very extensive office," with numerous duties, never discharged. Raymond used to sit in the chimney-corner late, very late on a winter's night, because he was too shiftless to get ready for bed. But after a while the fire burned low-the glow on the embers faded, and it grew cold in the chimney-corner; then Raymond became chilly, and he would sneak to rest, where his wife perhaps had been for several hours, endeavoring to recover from the severe fatigue of a day's work, into which had been crowded the greater portion of her husband's legitimate duties. Raymond owned a large farm, left him by his father. It was good land, but the fences were<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6124-00000007"/> not in repair, and every body's cattle roamed through the fields, and Raymond's crops were not sufficient to yield the family a decent support. The farm had once been well stocked, but for want of proper attention the cattle became poor-the sheep were never folded, even in the most rigorous weather, and many of them died. The wool was never properly sheared and washed, and when taken to market it would not bring the market price. Had it not been for Raymond's wife, who was a business woman, the family must often have suffered for the common necessaries of life.</p> 
               <p>Raymond's chores were rarely attended to by himself, but was a neighbor sick, no man was more willing to work in his place. He was relied upon as the man who would always neglect his own interests, to look after those of somebody else. He could never set himself at his own farm-work, but he was considered an excellent hand, when, to oblige a neighbor, he took a job in his field.</p> 
               <p>It was a bleak morning in mid-winter. Raymond Warren's wife was in the barn-yard foddering the cattle-Raymond was in bed. The light of a brisk fire which his wife had built, shone directly in his face. It awakened him-the room was warm, and Raymond was persuaded by its inviting appearance to arise. He sat down by the fire-place in his shirt-sleeves, and waited for his wife to come and get him some breakfast. As he warmed his feet he felt that he had reason to congratulate himself on his happy situation, and he said to himself-</p> 
               <p>"'Tain't every man's got such a wife as I have. Here she's made a good fire, and I'll bet the chores are all done."</p> 
               <p>The chores were done, and Raymond had scarcely finished his soliloquy, when the useful wife hastened to the fire-place to warm her hands, which had become thoroughly chilled by the cold handle of the pitchfork, with which she had been throwing hay and straw to the cattle.</p> 
               <p>It might be supposed that these occurrences took place early in the morning-not so. It was ten o'clock when Raymond Warren left his bed. His wife had been sewing for two hours, before she prepared her breakfast; then she urged Raymond for an hour longer to get up. He made fair promises but left them all unfulfilled. She waited until it was nine o'clock, and then knowing her husband's easy habits, and ashamed to have the<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6124-00000008"/> cattle unfed at that hour of the day, she determined to attend to their wants herself.</p> 
               <p>Raymond's first salutation to her as she stood by the fire, was,</p> 
               <p>"I wish I had some tea, Sally-but never mind, you've put the things away-a little warm water, with a little milk and sugar in it, will do just as well, and while you're about it, you may get me a little piece of bread; but just as you chose; no matter about it anyhow. 'Taint every man's got such a woman for a wife."</p> 
               <p>She might have answered,</p> 
               <p>"It is not every woman that has such a husband."</p> 
               <p>But she knew such remarks would only make bitter feelings, and though fatigued with the violent exercise she had taken, she went cheerfully and prepared her easy, good-natured husband a cup of tea and a slice of toast, and then asked him if he would not cut some wood.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I will," was his response.</p> 
               <p>His breakfast over, he took up his axe, mounted the wood-pile and cut half-a-dozen sticks, when along came a neighbor, who wanted Raymond to accompany him to a saw-mill, about two miles distant, and assist in loading upon a sled some boards which had been sawed for him-of course Raymond went, and his wife was compelled to cut wood enough to keep the house warm until the following day.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Warren was in appearance a feeble woman, but she had endured hardship which would have destroyed the constitution of one much more robust. Day after day her strength failed her, yet she made no complaint. Raymond saw that she grew pale, and was often disturbed with fears in regard to her, but he was too easy to mention the subject, and the useful wife became more and more feeble, until she was seized with a violent cough. Raymond was one day thoughtful enough to speak to the village doctor as he passed their house with his ponderous medicine portmanteau on his arm, and the benevolent gentleman, who had some knowledge of Raymond's peculiar failings, left the woman an innocent tincture, and forbade exposure to the cold atmosphere under any circumstances, and also declared that her complaint was of a character very much aggravated by severe exercise.</p> 
               <p>For a few days Raymond remembered the Doctor's counsel, and as he had respect for the physician, he obeyed him as nearly as his constitutional<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6124-00000009"/> tional failings permitted, but soon the wife was again obliged to chop wood and feed cattle, and taking a severe cold, she faded as would fade the summer rose in a frigid climate.</p> 
               <p>When Raymond Warren's house was desolate, and his fireside cheerless, he saw what had been his great error during the two years of his married life, and he mourned his wife deeply, it must be said in his favor, both as a helpmate and a companion. He rented his farm and managed to exist "easily" for one year; but he was a domestic man-he was not satisfied with a childless widower's solitary lot, and he began to look about him for a second helpmate and companion. In a few months he took to his home a woman, who, he confidently felt, would fill the place left vacant by his first wife. Sadly was Raymond disappointed. A few weeks elapsed, and he fell into his old habits with complete abandon. Leaving his own work in a neglected state, he worked diligently one day to assist a neighbor in getting wood to his house, and he returned to his home, late at night, hungry and fatigued, expecting that his wife would have ready for his refreshment an inviting supper. In this hope, he had refused to take supper with the neighbor whom he had assisted. Poor fellow! the kitchen, where was to have been his excellent supper, attended by a smiling wife, was cold and unoccupied. No frugal board was there, and Mrs. Warren was in bed. Raymond was much astonished, but was too good-natured to complain, and silently he ventured to explore the cupboard for a crust on which to satisfy the gnawings of his appetite. Not a crumb was there. It was evident his wife had designed that he should go to bed supperless; and supper-less to bed he did go, grieving seriously over his hard lot. He had never before been so badly treated, and he thought it indeed distressing, but yet his disappointment was not sad enough to revolutionize his constitutional good nature, and without a mutter he fell sound asleep.</p> 
               <p>Raymond Warren did not hear chanticleer salute the morning, as it dawned after the night of his grievous disappointment. It was spring-time, and the birds sang under his window, but he heard them not; yet he heard his wife, who had risen before the sun, call him-</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Warren, here I've been for an hour in the cold. The wood's all burned. It's time I had some cut. If you want any breakfast, you had better get up."</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6124-00000010"/> 
               <p>Was Raymond dreaming? Was this a voice of reproach, that came to him in his sleep, with recollections of the wife that had gone before him to the Spirit Land? Not so-it was a voice from the wife that dwelt with him in this sphere of existence, that came to remind him of duties not discharged, upon the performance of which depended the satisfaction of those desires which had intruded visions of feasts upon his hours of rest. All this he felt, still he did not offer to leave his couch.</p> 
               <p>"Raymond Warren," again said the voice, "you left me yesterday without wood, to help a neighbor get wood for his wife, and you went to bed last night without your supper. You'll not get a bite to eat in this house till you bring me wood to cook it with."</p> 
               <p>"There's plenty of chips," said Raymond, in palliation, rising on his elbow as he spoke.</p> 
               <p>"Get up, then, and bring them into the house," said the resolute wife. "I didn't know you when we were married, but I know you now. I know what killed your first wife. You want to make a slave of me. I'll attend to my duties; but if you don't do your chores, the cattle may starve, and you'll never get a bite to eat in this house unless you take it uncooked, if you don't cut wood yourself or get somebody to do it for you."</p> 
               <p>Raymond started bolt upright, and it was not many minutes before he was at the wood-pile. Diligently did he work until he had cut an armful, which, like a dutiful husband, for the first time in his life, he carried into the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>His wife made no allusion to what had passed between them, and Raymond, although burning with curiosity to know where she had learned what she had revealed to him, dared not commence conversation in relation to it. The train of ills it might revive was fearful to the easy man's mind. His breakfast over, forgetful of its lesson, careless Raymond wandered away from home, his necessary morning labors in his farm-yard unattended to, and his wood-pile unvisited. He returned home at noon, strong in the faith that he should sit down to a good dinner, because he was one of those men who think that a wife should always give her husband a good dinner, whether she have any thing to cook or not. Mrs. Warren had enough to cook, but nothing to cook with; however, much to Raymond's satisfaction, when he entered his home, he found the table spread, and<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6124-00000011"/> he knew he should soon be invited to take a seat near it.</p> 
               <p>When the invitation came, he hastened to his accustomed seat, lifted the cover from a dish that he supposed contained meat; and, truly, there was meat, but just as it came from the butcher's. Raymond was not a cannibal; he looked at his wife inquiringly; she appeared to be waiting patiently to be served. He lifted the cover of another dish;-there were potatoes just as they had been dug from the earth. All the dishes that usually contained victuals were covered. Raymond grew suspicious, and he lifted the covers hastily. There was bread, as it had come from the tray; there were turnips that had never been under the influence of fire; there were apples, handsomely sliced for sauce, and there were numerous other edibles, but none of them could Raymond eat. He turned for consolation to a cup of tea his wife had deposited near his plate. There were tea-leaves floating in the cup, but the tea looked remarkably pale; nevertheless, Raymond, by force of habit, blew it vigorously to prepare it for his palate. But when he put it to his lips, he found that he had wasted his breath; for the <emph>water</emph> was as cold as when it came from the spring.</p> 
                
               <p>Raymond was not a hasty man. He pushed back his chair deliberately, and thought aloud:</p> 
               <p>"In the name of Heaven, what does this mean?"</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Warren, whose countenance during this scene had worn a sober aspect, now smiled pleasantly, and answered:</p> 
               <p>"The victuals were all on the stove the usual time."</p> 
               <p>"It's strange they were not cooked," said Raymond.</p> 
               <p>"Not at all," replied Mrs. Warren; "there was no wood to cook them with."</p> 
               <p>In an instant Easy Warren then saw what a "moral" there was in his novel dinner, and, with a keen appetite, he went to work on the woodpile. He took his dinner and supper together that day, and he remembered that Mrs. Warren said:</p> 
               <p>"Now, Raymond, whenever you leave me without wood, you must eat victuals that have been cooked on a cold stove."</p> 
               <p>Many women would have stormed and scolded, but Mrs. Warren knew there was a better way to correct her easy husband's carelessness, or shiftlessness, as the reader pleases.</p> 
               <p>One day, there was no flour in the house, and<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6124-00000012"/> Raymond was about to go with some neighbors to a town-meeting, when his wife hid his best coat, and reminded him of the empty flour-barrel. Another day, his corn was to be gathered, when a neighbor desired him to assist him with his horses and wagon. It was a neighbor who often received favors, but seldom rendered them; yet Easy Warren could not refuse him. But, when he went to hitch his horses before his wagon, he found that one of the wheels was missing. Of course, the neighbor was disappointed. In the afternoon, when Raymond expressed a wish to draw his corn, his wife told him where he could find the lost wagon-wheel.</p> 
               <p>Thus was Easy Warren's household managed, until he began to realize practically what the error of his life had been. People said: "Warren's farm looks much better than it did some years ago." Mrs. Warren never interfered with Raymond's business except when he neglected it, and then she never found fault or scolded, but took occasion to show his neglect to him in a manner which impressed him with his injustice to his own interests.</p> 
               <p>Raymond's cattle were well cared for, and were in good order. When his fences were down, if he did not replace them, his wife employed a neighbor to make the necessary repairs. His wife took the papers, and read them; she knew the state of the market, and, to oblige her, Raymond had his grain in market when the price was highest. Some people said:</p> 
               <p>"Easy Warren is a hen-pecked husband."</p> 
               <p>But he knew better; and he often boasted that his wife was more of "a business man" than he was.</p> 
               <p>They had lived together peaceably some years, when, one day, Raymond was in a good humor, thinking over his prosperous condition, and he told his wife: "I am a woman's-rights man of the true grit. They may say you wear the breeches, if they please,-I am satisfied to have you do the thinking for our firm. And, now I see what a fool I have been, I must make up for my early shiftlessness."</p> 
               <p>He did make up for his early shiftlessness; and, under his judicious wife's training, he became Industrious, instead of Easy Warren.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Warren had the correct idea of woman's rights and woman's wrongs. We commend her management to those who have "easy husbands." Especially do we commend it to those unfortunate women who have earned for themselves the opprobrious title of "SCOLDS."</p>

                  <head>THE CHRISTMAS SUPPER.</head> 
                  <p>PELEG-a homely name for a homely boy; but a boy as good as he was homely. Peleg Brown, or, as the school-boys tauntingly called him, because his complexion was nearly the color of a hazel-nut, Brown Peleg, was the only son of a worse than widowed woman, who lived in an humble cottage on the outskirts of a village situated upon the romantic stream, Kishacoquillas, a Pennsylvania tributary to the noble Juniata.</p> 
                  <p>Peleg's mother-one of those gentle women, who seem only able to hold life in its sunshine aspects, but whose experience is an evidence that they have latent strength for cloud and storm-was worse than widowed, because her husband, John Brown, had for several years been a confirmed drunkard, dependent upon the efforts of his gentle wife and feeble son for his food, raiment and shelter, as well as for the means obtained through force and stealth, by which he purchased at the village grog-shop the numerous drams that rendered his wife a creature of sorrow, and his son a youth shunned and forsaken by the boys of his age.</p> 
                  <p>It was Christmas-a holiday to most boys-but a day of labor to Peleg Brown. With his sawbuck upon his shoulder and his wood-saw under his arm, Peleg trudged through the snow, from one house to another, seeking a job. A pile of wood in front of the mansion of one of the wealthiest men of the village, attracted his attention, and he begged the privilege of sawing it into proper stove-lengths. He was told that he might carry it into the back yard, saw it, and pile it in the woodhouse. It was a good job. Peleg was a small boy, but he thought how many comforts he might buy his mother with the money the job would bring him, and, with a cheerful heart and a willing hand, he went to work. Noon came, and he sat down on his saw-buck to eat his frugal Christmas dinner. It was a blustering day, and the snow, whirled from the tops of the houses, fell upon Peleg, until he looked as if he were a miller's apprentice<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6124-00000014"/> tice; but he heeded not the snow or the cold, and was hurrying with his repast, that he might have the more time to work, when he found himself face to face with a handsome, well-dressed boy, about his own age, but of much larger size, who said to him:-</p> 
                  <p>"Halloa, little fellow, how much did you have to spend for Christmas?"</p> 
                  <p>"I had nothing, sir," honestly answered Peleg, somewhat astonished at the abrupt question, "but if I work well to-day, mother will make me a nice pie when I go home."</p> 
                  <p>"Ha, ha," cried the well-dressed boy-"work on Christmas, and get a <emph>nice</emph> pie for it. You're a little unfortunate. Where do you live?"</p> 
                  <p>This was said with an air, as if the speaker regarded Peleg a curiosity; but Peleg was too honest to notice such irony, and he answered frankly,</p> 
                  <p>"I live in the little house back of the church on the common."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, ho! then you're the son of drunken Brown. No wonder you don't have any money to spend on Christmas. <emph>I</emph> had three dollars-<emph>my</emph> father ain't a drunkard."</p> 
                  <p>Peleg was hurt-sorely hurt-but he thought of his mother, and uttered no retort. He made his saw run glibly through the wood, and paid no attention to the careless boy that had taunted him. When he turned around to get another stick of wood to lay upon his buck, he noticed that his tormentor was gone.</p> 
                  <p>This boy was the only son of the merchant for whom Peleg was sawing wood. When he left the yard he ran into the parlor, where his mother, father, and sister were sitting, and marching up to the latter, he whispered-</p> 
                  <p>"There's a character in the yard, Jane, a chap that'll just suit you. He is sawing wood on Christmas, to get a pie at night. Ain't he a character?"</p> 
                  <p>"What character?" inquired the father, catching the last words; "come, Frank, what mischief have you been up to now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing, pa," returned the boy, "only I had been out to see my pony, when I found a character in the yard-the son of drunkard Brown is sawing our wood, and I had some fun with him."</p> 
                  <p>"You did not make fun of his misfortunes, I hope, my son," said his mother.</p> 
                  <p>"No, mamma," replied Frank, "I only laughed at him a little for having to saw wood on Christmas, and being content with a <emph>nice</emph> pie at night."</p> 
                  <p>"That was naughty, Frank," said Jane.</p> 
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6124-00000015"/> 
                  <p>"Come, come, Jane," interrupted the father, "let Frank have his sport to-day. You may preach to him to-morrow. But, Frank, you must not associate with drunkards' sons and wood-sawyers. It is bad enough to have <emph>one</emph> in the family given to such company."</p> 
                  <p>This last sentence was intended as a reprimand to Jane. She felt it, and left the parlor. As she walked to her own room, the tears started in her eyes, and her heart said, "Why does not father love me? He tells me I am homely. He says Frank is his only pride. But I love father, though he never does call me pet. I'm sure if I do associate with drunkards' children, it's not to disobey <emph>pa,</emph> but it is because I love to see them have something good to eat and wear. Ma loves me for this, and other people say I am good. Why does not pa love me?"</p> 
                  <p>Again and again she asked herself this question, and still she could find no answer, but, that she was a homely girl, and Frank was a handsome boy. She did not feel that her father was a worldly man-one whose heart was on houses, and lands, and stocks, and bills-that he loved Frank because he was fine looking, and, what the parent was pleased to term a "<emph>sharp</emph>" boy-that he expected him to sustain the credit of the house of Pridare &amp; Co., and that he had nothing to expect of Jane, because she was not only homely, but seemed to have no joy in the society of the rich and proud who visited his house-would rather, even when it stormed, carry a basket of clothing around to the poor children in the neighborhood, than sit in the parlor and play the piano for visitors. Frank laughed at Jane for these "<emph>whims.</emph>" He loved the dashing company that visited his father's house-he was well pleased when his father allowed him to sit down with the proud visitors to a rich supper, and drink the choice wine which flowed freely around the board. Sometimes his mother thought he took too much wine, but the father said-</p> 
                  <p>"No, it don't hurt him; he's of the real Pridare stock. He knows what good wine is, and it is <emph>good</emph> for him."</p> 
                  <p>Night was approaching; little Peleg prepared to quit work for the day. His "job" was not finished, but he sent a modest request into the house that, as it was Christmas, he might be paid for what he had done; promising to come on the morrow and complete his work. His request was granted, and he was carefully placing the hard-earned<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6124-00000016"/> earned sixpences in the pocket of his ragged jacket, when a young lady crossed the yard towards him. It was Jane, who had determined to do something for the drunkard's son, which would cause him to forget Frank's harshness, and remember that Christmas with pleasure.</p> 
                  <p>She spoke kindly to Peleg, and told him he must not think hard of what her brother had said; he was a thoughtless boy.</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't only for a moment, kind lady," said Peleg; "I know he doesn't feel what it is to be a drunkard's son. I am a poor boy, but I've got a good mother, and I love her."</p> 
                  <p>"You are a good boy," said Jane; "stay here a moment, I have something to send your mother."</p> 
                  <p>Peleg put down his saw-buck, and Jane ran into the house. In a moment she appeared again, bringing a basket, which was carefully covered, and which Peleg found to be heavy, when Jane put it into into his hand, saying-</p> 
                  <p>"Carry this to your mother, and tell her it is from Jane Pridare."</p> 
                  <p>"We are not beggars," was on Peleg's lip, but Jane smiled upon him so sweetly he could not say it. Thanking her with a tone which made her heart thrill, he bid her good evening, and ran homeward. He had worked hard, and he was tired; he carried his wood-saw and buck and a heavy basket; but the remembrance of Jane's smile was warm in his heart, and he walked not a step until he reached his mother's cottage.</p> 
                  <p>He was gladly received, joyfully welcomed, and the basket was quickly opened. There, nicely and carefully packed, was an assortment of delicacies such as Peleg had never partaken of, and such as his mother had not seen for many years.</p> 
                  <p>The mother prepared the Christmas supper in the neatest style her meagerly furnished house would allow, and when Peleg had dressed himself in his sabbath school suit, they sat down to such a repast as had never been eaten in that cottage. There was but one thing wanting to complete comfort-the husband and father could not partake with mother and son. He was at the village grogshop, and he did not come home till long after Peleg had recited his lessons to his mother, and was dreaming of Jane Pridare.</p> 
                  <p>The wife had left for the husband a portion of the Christmas supper in the most tempting manner she could prepare it, but he was in no mood for "delicacies." He threw himself upon his couch-<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6124-00000017"/> slept the sleep of a drunkard, and was away from the cottage again as soon as it was light, seeking his bitters.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head>THE BIRTH-NIGHT PARTY.</head> 
                  <p>SPRING had come-birds sang sweetly in the bushes, and modest flowers were springing to new life in the narrow beds around the pretty cottage where dwelt little Peleg and his mother-but within there was sadness, sorrow and death. There lay a body, prepared for the narrow bed "appointed for all the living." The spirit <emph>un</emph>prepared had been liberated by violence, from the bonds which confined it to earth, and was now where it witnessed, in all its dreadful reality, the degrading results of those habits which debase high resolves and yield holy pleasures, for the gratification of low passions and grovelling appetites.</p> 
                  <p>The husband and father had been found dead, on the highway between the village grog-shop and his home. His death was a violent one-what man who ever died of the direct influences of intoxication, did not have a violent death?</p> 
                   
                  <p>The funeral was not numerously attended; from the churchyard to their saddened home, but one person accompanied the chief mourners-that one was Jane Pridare. She was welcomed to the cottage in a manner which showed that she was a frequent, but never a tedious visitor.</p> 
                  <p>"You have been so kind to us," said Peleg-"You are a little girl, not bigger than I am, but you can do so much."</p> 
                  <p>"Father is kind to me, Peleg. He is rich, and I have something to do with. If you were as rich as I am, you could do a great deal more than I do."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll be rich <emph>some</emph> day," said Peleg, "I know I will; and then I'll do a great deal. I'll not forget the poor, I know I won't."</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps you can do something for some of my folks some day," returned Jane.</p> 
                  <p>"But you're so rich, you'll never be poor, and what I can do I must do for the poor. I never can forget the time when I was a poor drunkard's son, if I live to be a hundred years old, and get as rich as Stephen Girard," answered Peleg.</p> 
                  <p>"I've read in my books, Peleg," said Jane, "of many rich people becoming poor. You nor I don't know what may happen; but I must run<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6124-00000018"/> home now. Good-bye, Peleg, and good bye, Mrs. Brown."</p> 
                  <p>"Good-bye, my little benefactress," said Mrs. Brown.</p> 
                  <p>Peleg followed Jane to the garden gate, and there said good-bye, as Jane went tripping over the common towards the village.</p> 
                  <p>In a moment she cried "Peleg! Peleg!"</p> 
                  <p>Peleg ran to meet her, when she whispered, as if the wind must not catch the sound and bear it to other ears.</p> 
                  <p>"I've thought of something, Peleg-I've something to tell you, Peleg-but I won't tell it now-to-morrow, Peleg, to-morrow."</p> 
                  <p>And although the boy made an effort to detain her, in a moment she was tripping across the common again. Peleg could not imagine why Jane should not tell him then, if she had any thing important to communicate, nor was he able to conjecture what she might have to tell him. He went back to the cottage, but said nothing of Jane's conduct, determined that until he knew her secret he would keep his own.</p> 
                  <p>When Jane reached home, she found that her father and mother had just taken dinner, and were in the parlor. She ate her dinner in haste, fearing that her father would go to the store before she could see him. When she was ready to enter the parlor, he was still at home, however, and she greeted him in a most pleasant manner.</p> 
                  <p>"And where have you been roaming to-day, Jane?" inquired Mr. Pridare.</p> 
                  <p>"I went to Mr. Brown's funeral."</p> 
                  <p>"The Browns have become great favorites of yours, Jane."</p> 
                  <p>"They are nice people, father, and I could not neglect the mother, and that honest little boy, just because Mr. Brown was a drunkard."</p> 
                  <p>"Well-well, Jane, you <emph>can't</emph> be Frank, and I suppose you must have your whims; I don't expect much of you."</p> 
                  <p>"Now, pa, don't be cross, or scold me to-day," said Jane, walking up confidently to her father, and placing her hand on his knees, "I have something to ask of you."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pridare was a man, who, with all his harshness to Jane, loved to indulge her. He was touched by her winning manner, and said, smiling,</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Jane, I am not in a bad humor, and it would not be strange if I granted you a favor, notwithstanding you have been a truant to-day."</p> 
                  <p>"No, pa, mother said I might go to the funeral<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6124-00000019"/> ral; but I don't want to ask any thing for myself. I heard one of the clerks say, this morning, that a boy was needed at the store. Won't you let that little Peleg Brown come? He'll work hard, father, and I know he's honest."</p> 
                  <p>"Well-<emph>well,</emph> Jane," said Mr. Pridare, "I should think you were getting familiar with the Browns. The first we know, this little Peleg will be a beau of yours; a drunkard's son waiting on <emph>my</emph> daughter!"</p> 
                  <p>"No-no, father; I'm sure I never thought of having a beau. I don't want a beau," interrupted Jane, in her simplicity, not seeing the bearing of her father's objections. "But, pa, do give this boy a place. He supports his mother, and I'm sure he's honest."</p> 
                  <p>"You've set your heart on it, Jane. Perhaps I'll take this fellow: I'll see about it this evening."</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, pa; not for myself, but for the poor boy's widowed mother," said Jane; following her father, as he walked through the hall, on his way to the counting-room of the firm of Pridare &amp; Co.</p> 
                  <p>Whether Mr. Pridare made any inquiries respecting Peleg Brown, he never chose to disclose; but certain it is that, on the morrow, Jane sent a note to the boy, which, when he opened it, with beating heart, and glistening eye, he found to contain the following words:</p> 
                  <q>
                     <floatingText xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"> 
                        <body > 
                           <div type="letter"> 
                              <p>"DEAR PELEG-I could not come to see you today, and tell you that secret, so I have sent this note. You are to live at our house-no, you are to work in the store, and live at home if you please, Will you come? Don't say no. I got the place for you from pa. Come this afternoon, pa will tell you what you must do this evening; he is so kind.</p> 
                              <closer>
                                 <signed>JANE."</signed>
                              </closer> 
                           </div> 
                        </body> 
                     </floatingText>
                  </q> 
                  <p>"Mother-mother!" cried Peleg, after he had read the note over and over again, half a dozen times, "mother, oh mother! see here-I told you I should be rich-I know I shall. See here-see what that little girl, not bigger than I am, and not as old, has done for me. I couldn't do anything for myself or you, but saw wood and run errands; but mother, see what Jane has done. Oh! I never thought it; but now I will do something for myself, mother, and for you. I <emph>will</emph> be rich, and I'll have a store of my own some day, and then I'll give poor boys a chance; and good boys, whose fathers are dead, like mine, shall have the first<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6124-00000020"/> chance. Oh! mother, we shall be <emph>so</emph> happy; don't you think we shall?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, my child," said Mrs. Brown, who, during Peleg's rhapsody, had read the note; "I am glad you have got this place: Jane is very kind to us."</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed she is, mother. I love her so. I'll be a brother to her-more than a brother."</p> 
                  <p>Mrs. Brown looked at her boy with a singular expression; she felt the meaning of his words, but knew that he did not, and she was compelled to think that when he did understand their true import, they might be to him the talisman of his severest trial.</p> 
                  <p>In a few days little Peleg was regularly installed assistant clerk, with the duties of an errand boy in the store of Pridare &amp; Co. His salary was a meagre one, but he was accustomed to frugality.</p> 
                  <p>He performed his duties, for nearly a year, with such strict assiduity and excellent judgment, that he was more rapidly promoted than boys of his age usually are in extensive stores, and before the end of the first quarter of the second year, he was considered one of the most useful and trustworthy salesmen of the establishment. He had not been in the employment of Pridare &amp; Co. a year and a half, when he was made assistant book-keeper, with an increased salary.</p> 
                  <p>Jane had watched the promotions of her little friend with much interest, but, that he might hold her father's favor, she said nothing about him, unless spoken to in reference to his conduct.</p> 
                  <p>Peleg often wondered why Jane was not as familiar with him, as she had been when he was a wood-sawyer, but as he grew older, he felt that they could not be brother and sister, except in such circumstances as placed them socially, for ever apart, and whenever he had reason to rejoice over prosperity, he would go to his trunk, and taking out Jane's note, which had been most carefully treasured, he would again peruse it with a beating heart and glistening eye, and say, as he had said to his mother, when he read this note for the first time:</p> 
                  <p>"I will be rich-I know I will."</p> 
                  <p>One afternoon, Peleg was arranging some accounts in a private room, when Frank Pridare paid him a visit.</p> 
                  <p>"Come, little Brown," said he, "<emph>You</emph> never have been one of us, but you <emph>must</emph> come out tonight, this is my twenty-first birth-day. After the party at father's to-night, where you will be <emph>of</emph>
                     <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6124-00000021"/> 
                     <emph>course,</emph> the boys in the store will adjourn down town for a grand spree. You will join us this <emph>once.</emph> You <emph>shan't</emph> back out."</p> 
                  <p>"You will excuse me, Mr. Pridare," said Peleg, mildly.</p> 
                  <p>No, I <emph>won't</emph> excuse you," answered Frank, sharply, "I won't do <emph>any</emph> such thing."</p> 
                  <p>"I have never been on a spree," said Peleg.</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph> needn't spree, if you don't want to," returned Frank, "but you <emph>shall</emph> go."</p> 
                  <p>"I cannot go," returned Peleg, firmly, "I would not countenance a spree by my presence."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah! I remember," said Frank. "You are one of these timid fools afraid of wine, afraid of being a drunkard. <emph>I'm</emph> not; <emph>I</emph> need not get drunk unless I want to. <emph>My</emph> father did not die a drunkard."</p> 
                  <p>"These are hard words, Mr. Pridare," answered Peleg, with a trembling voice; "if you live many years you will repent them; but I forgive you now, for your sister's sake."</p> 
                  <p>"Pooh!" cried Frank, with a sneer. "<emph>She's</emph> another of your canters, who think there's death in a social glass of wine. We wanted no empty chairs at our feast to-night, but empty chairs are better than canting fellows, who have no sociability. <emph>Good</emph> day, Mr. Temperance Preacher."</p> 
                  <p>Peleg's heart was heavy when Frank left him. He did not care for the sneers thrown at him, but associations were awakened, which ever carry a bitter sting to the sensitive heart. He determined he would not attend the birth-night party at Mr. Pridare's, an invitation to which had been given him by Frank, at Jane's solicitation. When he left the store, after the work of the day was over, he dispatched a note to Jane, in these words:</p>

                              <p>"MISS PRIDARE-A conversation with your brother this afternoon, in which my father's misfortunes were the subject of ridicule, will make it necessary for me to forego the pleasure of seeing you at his birth-night party. Your friend,</p> 
                              <closer>
                                 <signed>PELEG BROWN."</signed>

                  </q> 
                  <p>Jane did not receive this note until she had been expecting Peleg for some time. She flew to Frank for an explanation.</p> 
                  <p>"Bravo!" he answered, when he had read the note. "Bravo! I like the fellow's spunk. He foregoes the <emph>inestimable</emph> pleasure of seeing you, Jane, because when he refused to join the boys in a jubilee after the party, I told him he was afraid of being a drunkard, like his father."</p> 
                  <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6124-00000022"/> 
                  <p>"You were naughty," said Jane, in a tone which, had not the brother been flushed with wine, he would long have remembered. "It was unworthy of my brother; I would not have come here to-night, if I had been in Mr. Brown's place."</p> 
                  <p>"To be sure you would not; you and he would make a good match. But yonder's a party drinking bumpers to me; I cannot waste time with you, Jane."</p> 
                  <p>Frank was gone to join his wine-drinking companions. As she saw him drink glass after glass, Jane thought of what she had once said to Peleg about doing something for her folks some day, and she pressed closer the little note she had that evening received, and wished--.</p> 
                  <p>When Peleg had taken supper with his mother, and many times refused to confide to her the cause of a manifest depression of spirits, he walked down into the village, found his way to his little room, back of the store, and, taking up an engaging book, read and thought, and calculated, till a late hour. It was after midnight when he began to retrace his steps to the cottage. As he sauntered slowly through a portion of the village sparsely inhabited, he observed a man lying across the dilapidated steps of an untenanted building. He stooped to look at the unfortunate being, and ascertain whether he was intoxicated, or had been physically injured by ruffians, when something familiar about the dress arrested his attention. He dragged the apparently lifeless body towards a hotel a few rods distant, and by the light reflected from the bar-room, was able to discover that he had found-as it were, dead in the street-the only son of his employer. His birth-night spree had been too much for Frank Pridare: he had entered <emph>manfully</emph> upon the year of his majority.</p> 
                  <p>Peleg was grieved and bewildered-grieved to find young Pridare in such a situation, and bewildered in respect to his duty towards him and the family. He forgot all the harsh words Frank had said to him, and determined that he would endeavor to get him to his father's house without calling such assistance as might make public the young man's degradation. He applied at the hotel, and succeeded in arousing the ostler, who, for half a week's wages, consented to assist Peleg. Frank was borne home. When they approached the Pridare mansion, Peleg dismissed his "help," and knowing the appointments of the house, he awakened a servant without arousing the family, and told him that he wished to see Mr. Pridare on<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6124-00000023"/> important business, and that he must be awakened without alarming any other member of the household. The servant was faithful-he had often discharged such duties-and Mr. Pridare soon met Peleg, who conducted him to Frank, and explained the circumstances under which he had been found.</p> 
                  <p>The services of the servant who had awakened Mr. Pridare were further required, and Frank was secretly conveyed into the house and silently placed in his own bed. When Peleg departed from Mr. Pridare, the latter said:</p> 
                  <p>"I am deeply indebted to you for your discretion; neither Miss nor Mrs. Pridare must know a word of this."</p> 
                  <p>"I have only done my duty, sir," returned Peleg; "I shall respect your feelings."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pridare wished Frank had fallen into the care of any young man of the village, rather than Peleg Brown. As he stood by the bed-side of his drunken son, he thought of the time when he knew John Brown, who died a drunkard, to be a wealthy and respectable man; he thought of the Christmas-day Peleg sawed wood in his yard, and he reflected on the encouragement he then gave his now drunken boy, to take freely of that which had degraded him.</p> 
                  <p>These were bitter thoughts for an over-indulgent father.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head>REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.</head> 
                  <p>FIVE years have elapsed since Frank Pridare celebrated his twenty-first birth-night. Peleg Brown was first clerk in the extensive store of Pridare &amp; Co. Mr. Pridare had treated him with distant, but marked respect ever since the night on which his judgment was so nicely exercised for the reputation of the heir apparent to the Pridare station and importance. But there were now no occasions for the exercise of nice discrimination on this subject. Frank Pridare was a genteel sot, and he was so regarded in the village generally; not that a man can be genteel and be a sot-but Frank Pridare's sottishness was genteel, compared with that of many drinking men in the village. He was never seen drunk in the streets-he was never engaged in drunken brawls-his father kept the strictest watch upon him.</p> 
                  <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6124-00000024"/> 
                  <p>Little Brown's mother had been in the land of spirits two years. Peleg had, through life, loved his mother with that child-like fondness which ever regards MOTHER the dearest of names, and he mourned her deeply.</p> 
                  <p>The first clerk in the store of Pridare &amp; Co. knew well that for at least three years the capital of the firm had not been augmented, and he well knew also that in the last year it had very materially decreased, and he believed that something of this state of affairs was owing to the insidious influences of the "siren foe," that had saddened his earlier years, and embittered for life the recollections of his childhood.</p> 
                  <p>At the beginning of the sixth year of little Brown's clerkship he was enabled to take an inventory of the "stock in trade" of Pridare &amp; Co. When the work was completed to the satisfaction of his employers, he was informed that it was the intention of the junior partner of the firm to retire, and that he was desirous of finding some person who would purchase his interest. On the evening after Peleg learned this fact, he called at the Pridare mansion, and begged an hour's conversation with the proprietor.</p> 
                  <p>Supposing that something important in reference to business was to be communicated, Mr. Pridare promptly invited little Brown to his private room. When they had talked together on general matters for a few moments, Mr. Pridare said:</p> 
                  <p>"You have something important to communicate, I understand."</p> 
                  <p>"I am informed," replied Peleg, "that Mr. Hanks is desirous of finding some one who will purchase his interest in the store."</p> 
                  <p>"Such is the fact," said Mr. Pridare, "and I wish that I knew of some man acquainted with our business who could take his place, since it is forbidden me to give it to my son, for whom I had intended it. 'Pridare &amp; Son'-I should have rejoiced to see that name in gilt letters over the door of our store, but-but, it is passed. I speak freely to you, sir. You respect my feelings."</p> 
                  <p>"For that reason I have called upon you. I have had some intention of making Mr. Hanks a proposition, and before doing so, I wish to consult you," replied Peleg.</p> 
                  <p>"You!" exclaimed Mr. Pridare. "<emph>You</emph> make Mr. Hanks a proposition. Where in the name of Heaven did you get money enough to talk of buying an interest in the business of Pridare and company?"</p> 
                  <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6124-00000025"/> 
                  <p>"When my mother died, the cottage and lot were mine, sir; I sold them for fifteen hundred dollars. I invested the money in property on the Creek, which has more than doubled in value-and besides, sir, I have saved nearly two thousand dollars out of my wages since I have been in your employ."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes! yes!" said Mr. Pridare. "I had forgotten. You have been a saving boy-but I'll think of this. It is unexpected. I'll see Mr. Hanks. Leave me now."</p> 
                  <p>When Peleg was gone, Mr. Pridare had sorrowful reflections. He reviewed his life. He thought of the time when he and John Brown, Peleg's father, drank wine together-he thought of Peleg the little wood-sawyer-of John Brown's awful death-then he thought of his own habits, and the gradual encroachments upon his independence, of the love for what had made his boy-whom he had regarded in his youth with so much pride-a reproach to his family-and when he thought of <emph>his</emph> boy, then Peleg the drunkard's son came up in contrast, and with that contrast, a source of most poignant reproach, haunting him; he threw himself upon a couch, and conjured to himself the remarks of his correspondents in business, when they learned that little Brown was the junior partner of the firm of Pridare &amp; Co.</p> 
                  <p>The "<emph>fates</emph>" had decreed. Peleg Brown took Mr. Hanks' place in the firm of Pridare &amp; Co. He and Jane Pridare had been distant acquaintances during the whole period of his clerkship, but as he was now a frequent visitor at the Pridare mansion, on terms that were humiliating to neither party, the intimate friendship of youth was renewed between the little wood-sawyer and the little girl whose kind heart had secured him a situation of trust and profit.</p> 
                  <p>Peleg had been a partner but a few months, when Frank Pridare was one morning found dead in his bed. He had been intoxicated for several days. The physicians giving the cause of his death, it was announced in the newspapers:</p> 
                  <q>
                     <p>"DIED.-FRANK PRIDARE, aged twenty-seven years, only son of H. Pridare, Esq., of the firm of Pridare &amp; Co.-of <emph>apoplexy,</emph> on the -- day of --."</p>
                  </q> 
                  <p>Mr. Pridare was a changed man after this death. He knew that the physicians were guilty of a professional libel when they said his son had died of "<emph>apoplexy</emph>" Wine was banished from his table<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6124-00000026"/> -the flush left his cheek-he became melancholy-absent-minded. The business of the firm of Pridare &amp; Co., devolved mainly on little Brown. He discharged his duties with excellent judgment, and the credit of the firm was re-established. Mr. Pridare treated Peleg not only with kindness, but with deference.</p> 
                  <p>When the mother and sister of Frank Pridare had left off mourning apparel, in memory of the "early lost," and Jane Pridare again went into company, Peleg Brown was her constant attendant.</p> 
                  <p>One evening they walked across the Common towards the site of the cottage in which Jane first saw Peleg's mother. A handsome mansion stood in the place of the cottage; it was the property of Peleg Brown. Jane and Peleg entered this mansion. Jane admired the style in which it was furnished; she complimented Peleg warmly upon his taste, and Peleg said to her:</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow it will be our home, and your father and mother will live with us. Come-I will show you their apartments."</p> 
                  <p>The little wood-sawyer and the rich merchant's daughter had been married nearly three months.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Pridare put all of his property into the hands of his son-in-law, and Peleg purchased the interest of the second member of the firm; and if Mr. Pridare did not see the name of Pridare and Son, over the door of the store, he saw that of "PRIDARE &amp; BROWN," and he felt that Peleg was a son to him.</p> 
                  <p>The little wood-sawyer-frugal, industrious and temperate-was the wealthy husband of the girl who spoke kindly to him in his severe Christmas labor. Now he was the support and protection of him who had warned his children to shun the society of the drunkard's son; and the youth who, at a father's prompting, had ridiculed his simple desires-taunted him with his early misfortunes-and abused him as an enemy to social habits, because he would not join in a "spree"-had met a drunkard's reward in that sphere where none know the right, and "still the wrong pursue."</p>

               <head>AUNT PATIENCE.</head> 
               <p>MY Aunt Patience was a tender-hearted woman, who suffered from exquisitely-delicate nerves, and who rejoiced with self-complacent satisfaction in a peculiar system of strict domestic economy. She was an excitable woman, but, <emph>her</emph> story for it, never in a passion; yet had any body doubted her economy-the excellence of her management-she would probably have scolded with a vigor, which few calm women could equal.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience was a widow, with a wayward child, which sadly violated its calculating mother's strict rules for domestic comfort. Aunt Patience was too tender-hearted to cross her daughter seriously; yet she always considered her parental authority amply sufficient, no matter if the neighbors did say that little Patience was a spoiled child, because she had her own way. Now, such gossip sounded strangely to Aunt Patience when it chanced to come to her ears. To be sure, she could not bear to scold the child, except when excited; but she could always control her by "strategy"-that kind of plain, very plain stratagem, by which one man gets another to work hard for him when he rewards the workman well.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience lived in a quiet New England village. Her husband had left her property enough, with systematic economy, to have afforded her a liberal support. With her system of "strict economy," Aunt Patience never had a liberal support.</p> 
               <p>All this I learned of Aunt Patience, when I happened to be a visitor at her house for a few days. Every day I sympathized deeply with her as a martyr to economy. The history of one day will illustrate her system of management.</p> 
               <p>A lecturer on phrenology had come to the village. Little Patience heard, among her schoolmates, all about the wonderful things he could tell from the "bumps" on people's heads, and she ran home gleefully, quite determined that he shouldn't put his fingers on her "bumps," but that she would go to the lecture, and hear what he said of other folks.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience had company in her modest<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6124-00000028"/> parlor, but that made no difference to little Patience. In she burst, saucily exclaiming,</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ma, there's such a funny man going to lecture at the school-house! It's only a shilling, and I'm going!"</p> 
               <p>"La! child, now you haven't got any dress that's fit to go with, and, besides, we couldn't afford it. You have got no father to earn shillings for you." And Aunt Patience wiped her eyes, as if sorrowful recollections had called tears into them.</p> 
               <p>But her emotion in no wise affected little Patience, who flung back her head disdainfully, and, in a defiant tone, said-</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, if I can't go to the lecture, I'll have just as much pound-cake as I can eat."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience made no objection. It had been useless. In a twinkle little Patience was gone, and then Aunt Patience said to her visitor-</p> 
               <p>"The child loves cake so well I cannot deny her, especially when she is so good to mind."</p> 
               <p>I looked at Aunt Patience when she said this-her eyes were dry, but she appeared to be in earnest.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments I saw little Patience in the front yard, devouring, with unfeigned satisfaction, a large piece of very rich cake. I was obliged to inquire-of course to myself; I could not think of asking Aunt Patience-in a mercantile way, what might have been the first cost of that luxury by which little Patience had been bought into obedience for the saving of a shilling.</p> 
               <p>The company which Aunt Patience had in her parlor was a lady, who was endeavoring to organize a select school in the village, and she had come to solicit the patronage of Aunt Patience. Poor woman, she could not afford it, and the lady took her leave, calculating, perhaps, as I did, how much pound-cake it would have required-provided little Patience could have been denied-to pay one child's tuition.</p> 
               <p>But the end is not yet. While little Patience was eating her cake in the front yard, half a dozen of her playmates came to visit her. They were all going to the lecture, and they all talked about how "funny" it would be, and all regretted that Patience could not go. Her curiosity was again excited, and when one of the little girls said,</p> 
               <p>"What a pity you can't go, Patience!" she answered.</p> 
               <p>"But I <emph>will</emph> go!"</p> 
               <p>"But your mother gave you cake to stay at home," said her companion.</p> 
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6124-00000029"/> 
               <p>"I don't care; I <emph>will</emph> go any how," was her response, in a very spiteful humor; and abruptly leaving her playmates, away she sped to tell her mother that she must have a shilling to go to the lecture, because it would be "<emph>so</emph> funny."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience was proud of her government. She had boasted of it before me, and could not think of giving up her point.</p> 
               <p>As soon as little Patience came within hearing of her mother, she cried,</p> 
               <p>"Ma, ma, all the girls are going to that lecture, and I shan't stay at home, if I did have cake."</p> 
               <p>"Now, my child, you'll not be naughty," said Aunt Patience, mildly.</p> 
               <p>"But I'll go to the lecture, for cousin William will give me a shilling."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Patience was proud, and would, by no means, suffer her child to beg; and when her daughter reported what I had indeed promised to do, she was more than ever determined that little Patience should not go to the lecture. She called the child from the parlor, and when next I saw her she was enjoying herself over a dish of preserves. Looking up archly, she said,</p> 
               <p>"I ain't going to that lecture, for I've got such a lot of good preserves; but I wish you'd give me that shilling, any how. I shan't tell ma."</p> 
               <p>When I was alone with Aunt Patience she discoursed quite learnedly on the necessity of governing children, and teaching them economy, especially when they couldn't expect much in the world, and she added:</p> 
               <p>"Now, some folks would have set up their parental authority, and made little Patience sick a-crying and taking on; but I managed her more easily. She doesn't care a fig about that lecture."</p> 
               <p>I did not dispute this self-satisfying conclusion, but waited for the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>Late at night I was reading in my room. There was a knock at the door, and, at my bidding, in came Aunt Patience. She was very pale. I knew that she had been frightened, and eagerly inquired what was the matter. She answered,</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, little Patience is very sick. I can't imagine what ails her. O, she has vomited so much, and has such a fever! She often has such spells, but this is a little worse than common. Won't you go for a doctor?"</p> 
               <p>I said nothing, but thought of the shilling saved, the pound-cake, the preserves, and easy government, and went promptly for the village physician.</p> 
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6124-00000030"/> 
               <p>He came promptly, and Aunt Patience had a serious task in getting her sick child to take "nasty medicines." She was obliged to "set up her authority," and have "the child take on" often without avail.</p> 
               <p>The doctor knew that Aunt Patience was prompt pay, and little Patience was sick several days. His bill was five dollars, which Aunt Patience paid, thankful for her daughter's speedy recovery, and none the less reluctant to give her cake and preserves to keep her from "taking on."</p> 
               <p>All this for a shilling, or for one moment's decision! Rather too much! My Aunt Patience's system of economy was of that class described by the homely adage, "saving at the spile, and losing at the bung." There is not a little of it in this world, and it is not unfrequently connected with downright meanness.</p>

               <head>BUDS AND BLOSSOMS.</head> 
               <p>WITH the dandelion, which sets its cup of gold in the meadow-with the violet, which casts its blue eye into the brook-with the opening of peach blossoms and the swelling of apple buds-with the singing of birds and the piping of frogs-comes an ushering of life into the glad sunshine, which presents one of the pleasantest pictures of spring.</p> 
               <p>Men and women who love the sweetness of childhood because they have not forgotten the stirring joy of its gleeful sports, welcome the genial air of springtime, for leading children into the meadow, the orchard, the street and the park, as affectionately as they do for crowning the peach tree with its robe of purple and pink, or bestowing upon the apple tree a mantle odorous and delicately tinged. The shout and the laugh, speaking sweetly of youthful pleasure, fall in harmony with<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6124-00000031"/> the song that stirs the blossoms on the orchard bough, and dies away with their fragrance; and then, to the parent especially, how much brighter the pleasure which the bud of the household gives in its unfolding, than can the bud of the garden, be it ever so rare, or ever so fragrant and beautiful. In the stretching of youthful limbs and the expanding of narrow chests, there is grander hope than in the swaying of boughs or the spreading of branches. Never do the charms of childhood so recompense a mother's care and father's solicitude, as when, the warm sunshine falling on their golden locks, children chase butterflies among flowers, and while, to the parent's thought, contrasting their natures with opening buds and dying blossoms, in innocent thoughtlessness enjoy the wealth of spring time.</p> 
               <p>There is something, however, touchingly sad in the mingling of young life, animate and inanimate. See yonder tree with its blossoms falling-there is decay, but with it promise of fruit. Upon the topmost branch hangs something which cannot belong in such a place. It is a kite, that half an hour ago was a speck on the sky. Hopes were dashed with it when it was lodged among the dying blosoms; but its string was rudely broken, and its owner has gone to supply its place with another, stronger and larger. Soon he will try other and manlier ventures in the world; and not in as many months, but in as brief a period comparatively, his life will have ripened and gone to decay like the blossoms and the fruit of the tree where his kite was lost; yet he has never thought whether that life is to bear fruit, or whether it is to stand as a barren tree in the garden of humanity. Such thoughts will come when he takes less unregarded pleasure in flowers than now, but knows better their uses. There is a great lesson in that kite-the leader of ambition, lost among blossoms, which give promise of fruitage in their death.</p> 
               <p>Close in snug quarters have the germs of peaches and apples been struggling for many days; and with only glimpses of out-door life, have the buds which shall unfold into men and women, pined for the companionship of birds and flowers, through a weary winter; and when the birds flit from bough to bough, that they may sing where children are, and the violets look up from their lowly beds, with a brightness lent to their eyes, that they may return the loving glances with which they are sought; and when the dandelions spread their broad, shining faces to catch attention, who would<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6124-00000032"/> prevent childhood from gratifying the birds and sharing joy with the flowers!</p> 
               <p>No man knows that influence of nature, which can most clearly lift him above the meaner things of earth, unless having spent a day in the country, with a group of children, while spring's sweetness is fresh, he realized in their expression of unselfish thankfulness, the near harmony between the glad shout of a child, the merry song of a bird, and the appealing beauty or wandering fragrance of a flower. The influences of such a day break the selfish crust that grows around hearts which know no songs but those of the concert hall, or of the canary in a drawing room or in a counting-house.</p> 
               <p>The men and women whose footsteps may be traced along the fixed paths of city business or pleasure, winter, spring, summer, and autumn-who never have appreciative knowledge of the changing feast nature spreads in field and forest for all who have eyes to see and ears to hear, are among the weakest of modern martyrs-weakest, because, though their penance is severe upon health and morals, the bonds which hold them captive are really slender.</p> 
                
               <p>An hour's enjoyment of the blissful repose-the poetry of quiet-which life in the country may afford, if intelligently sought, would break their yoke of a martyrdom.</p>

               <head>THE BURNING COIN.</head> 
               <p>"COME, come, Charles! the boys will go without you."</p> 
               <p>These words were uttered at his bedroom door by Charles Merwin's mother, early one bright, frosty morning in mid-winter.</p> 
               <p>The little fellow arousing himself from one of those morning naps which make the dreamer dread the sound of a breakfast-bell, for a moment nestled cozily in his warm couch, and listened to the bleak wind as it rattled the casement; then he be thought him how he had boasted to his companions on the previous evening, that none of them should reach the skating ground that morning earlier than he. He coveted no longer the sluggard's repose, but, springing from his bed, hastily dressed himself, and in a few moments was running briskly toward the public square of the village, to meet a few of his school-fellows, who had made appointments with each other to assem ble at sunrise, at a pond in the vicinity, and have a "good skate" before school time.</p> 
               <p>Charles had run half way from his father's house to the public square, when, on the opposite side of the street, he saw a number of men and boys standing around a cellar-door at the residence of one of the rich men of the village.</p> 
               <p>A playmate espied Charlie, and cried to him, "Come over here: there's something up."</p> 
               <p>Charlie's curiosity was excited, and for a moment he forgot the skating party, but lost no time in answering the call.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>What's</emph> up?" said he, when he stood beside his playmate.</p> 
               <p>"There's a fellow down here," answered the boy, pointing to the cellar.</p> 
               <p>"What fellow?" returned Charlie.</p> 
               <p>"Nobody knows," was the reply. "Mr. Janes heard somebody in the cellar last night; he was watching, and he slipped out and fastened the door. He says it ain't the first time his cellar's been robbed, and now he's got the thief safe; that is what I heard a man say. Let us stay and see who the fellow is, Charlie."</p> 
               <p>Charles agreed to this proposition, willing to gratify his curiosity for a little gossip at the<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6124-00000034"/> expense of the "fun" upon which he had calculated for the morning with his school-fellows at the pond.</p> 
               <p>The boys did not wait long. Mr. Janes soon came out of his house, and opening the front cellar-door, bid his prisoner walk forth. There was no answer to the call. Again he demanded that the prisoner show himself, but no one appeared. Lights were procured, and several men went into the cellar. To the astonishment of all who had waited, like Charlie, to gratify their curiosity, an elderly man, who, even under these circumstances, was regarded with deference, was brought forth.</p> 
               <p>"In the name of Heaven, Squire Johnson, is it you?" cried Mr. Janes, when he recognized the prisoner. "Why did you go into my cellar to steal, when you knew that whatever you wanted I would have freely given you? Say that you were not there to steal."</p> 
               <p>The old man did not lift his eyes from the ground, but sullenly answered, "I <emph>was</emph> there to steal. My family is starving, and I would not beg."</p> 
               <p>No one attempting to restrain him, his head bowed upon his chin, he walked through the crowd, and bent his way towards his miserable dwelling.</p> 
               <p>Squire Johnson had been a prominent man in the village. Twenty years previous to this scene, he was among the wealthiest men of the country, and one of the most popular.</p> 
               <p>Twice had he represented his county in the Legislature of the State, and for many years had been justice of the peace. He was a man respected by every body, even in degradation. No boy, however rude or thoughtless, ever taunted or cried after Squire Johnson when he staggered in the street.</p> 
               <p>Every man, woman, or child in the village soon knew that Squire Johnson had been caught stealing in Janes's cellar. It was shocking news. Charles Merwin was deeply affected by it, and he told his mother in a manner which led her to think it was an excellent opportunity to impart a useful lesson. She said to him:</p> 
               <p>"You know, Charles, we have often told you that Squire Johnson was once very much esteemed, and might have been a great man, if he had not been intemperate. If he had been a sober man, his family had enjoyed the luxuries of life, and there had been no necessity for him either to beg<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6124-00000035"/> or steal. Intemperance did it all, my child. I can remember well when Squire Johnson drank spirits moderately, and if any one had told him he would ever have become a drunkard he would have been very angry. He is now not only a drunkard, but a thief. Let this be a warning to you as long as you live, Charles, never to get in the habit of drinking ardent spirits. You will remember, this, my son."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed I will, mother," answered Charlie. "I don't see what men want to get drunk for when it makes such bad men of them."</p> 
               <p>"Be always of that mind, my son; and if you are ever tempted to drink, think of Squire Johnson," returned Mrs. Merwin.</p> 
               <p>It was as Squire Johnson had told Mr. Janes-his family was indeed destitute. Their distress had been known to but a few near neighbors. For several years the mother had been the main support of the family, assisted, as far as he was able to assist her, by her oldest son, a lad about fourteen years of age.</p> 
               <p>Now the mother, worn out with sorrow and fatigue, lay upon her couch, unable to lift her head.</p> 
               <p>The Squire came home from the grog-shop one evening, when the children had eaten nothing for a whole day, and one of his daughters said to him, "We are hungry, pa; won't you get us something to eat?"</p> 
               <p>He made her no answer, but went out, <emph>and was locked up in Mr. Janes's cellar.</emph> It was not the first time he had visited it. Mr. Janes lived in a splendid mansion which had belonged to Squire Johnson, and in which his family once dwelt. The news of her husband's theft could not be kept from Mrs. Johnson. He told her himself, and left his home never to return-no trace of him was ever received by his family. Mrs. Johnson died in a few days after her husband's disappearance. The children were well cared for; the eldest boy went to live with Mr. Janes.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Many years passed, and the boys whom Charles Merwin was to have met at a skating party, had grown to be men, and were engaged in business in various parts of the country. Some were men of influence, some were professional men, some merchants, some mechanics; but all did not bear closely in mind the lesson which Squire Johnson's exposure conveyed.</p> 
               <p>One, having delight in gay society, in spite of what he believed honest intentions, firm resolves,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6124-00000036"/> and determined promises to himself and friends, had learned to love the wine cup, as he loves it, who, by its wild excitement, is lifted above the plain realities of life-who dwells in an atmosphere through which a rosy light is thrown around him, that stimulates the imagination to clothe with many brilliant hues the quick coming fancies of a crowding future-while, first it dispels the rosy light, leaves in its stead the twilight of soberness, and then brings on a gloom, of which the rayless gloom of deepest night is but a faint symbol.</p> 
               <p>Remorse and repentance hang to him who emerges from this gloom. Sometimes they hang not securely; and sometimes the victim, to escape their pangs and his own shame, foolishly flies again into the forgetfulness of an hour, which the wine cup may afford him, to be only more wretched and more desperate at each return of that gloom, from which again he only escapes to sharper conviction and more stinging remorse.</p> 
               <p>This disgraceful round one of those boys had often taken who saw Squire Johnson bow beneath a load of guilt and shame which he did not survive. When intoxicated, he was disposed to desperate and dangerous exploits. He would be sober, and sorrowful on account of his disgrace for months; then his friends would miss him, and when found it would be in the midst of deepest disgrace. He had often strange and peculiar freaks when the spell was on him.</p> 
               <p>He had been the confidential clerk in an influential mercantile house of the city of Boston, but had been obliged to resign his situation.</p> 
               <p>He had not been sober for many weeks. It was Sabbath morning, and he promenaded one of the principal streets of the city, longing for means to procure deeper draughts of the poison that had blasted his prospects in life, and made him an object of pitying dread.</p> 
               <p>The church bells had some time since called the people to their respective places of worship. The young man passed a church, the doors of which were open. The sound of the preacher's voice came to him, and, with one of his singular impulses, he entered at the principal aisle, and, in view of the whole congregation, walked deliberately to the pulpit, ascended the steps, and reaching out his hand, interrupted the preacher by demanding of him, in a loud voice, "Give me some money, if you would save a perishing sinner! I must have rum."</p> 
               <p>The scene was one of a startling and exciting<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6124-00000037"/> character; gentlemen sprang from their seats in all parts of the house for the purpose of taking the sacrilegious intruder into custody; but the preacher, with a significant motion of his hand, restrained them, and, taking from his pocket a half-dollar, he placed it in the palm which had been strangely extended to him, saying only, in a low voice and a sad tone, "Charles Merwin, you have forgotten Squire Johnson and your mother's counsels."</p> 
               <p>Charles Merwin gazed wildly into the face of him who thus called up saddening recollections, and he knew that the preacher was James Johnson, who had become the adopted son of Mr. Janes when his father disappeared.</p> 
               <p>Closing his hand convulsively on the strangely gotten coin, the inebriate turned from the preacher, and it seemed that every eye in the crowded auditory met his staring vision. In an instant he was sober, and a realizing sense of his painfully peculiar position fastened upon him. He did not rush from the church, but walked as one upon whom remorse rested, a burden too heavy to be borne. He walked immediately to his boarding house, and still holding in his hand the money which the preacher had given him, he kneeled and fervently vowed, as he valued the memory of his departed mother, never again to "touch, taste, or handle the accursed thing," which, in the hour of Squire Johnson's disgrace, she had told him was the "elixir of misery."</p> 
               <p>When he rose from his knees his face was wet with tears; the preacher's coin burned his hand, and fell from it as if it had been red hot. It lay where it fell, and Charles walked his room a weeping penitent. There was a knock at his door, and the Rev. James Johnson entered and grasped his hand. He saw the coin upon the floor, and said, "Thank the Lord for that strange interruption in my pulpit to-day!"</p> 
               <p>The young men kneeled together and prayed together; and when they arose, Charles Merwin was so changed a man that his friend, having taken up the half dollar and offered it to him, he received it, saying, "A moment ago it burned my hand as if it had been a coal from the fires of the bottomless pit; now I can hold it, and vow that I will keep it. I will never be tempted while I have it."</p> 
               <p>Charles Merwin became a leading editor in an eastern city: forward in all true reforms, exerting a wide and happy influence. He will never violate the vow to his mother's memory.</p>

               <head>THE SMART BOY.</head> 
               <p>PARENTS are often martyrs to a feeling of pride, in what they consider the smartness of their children. I once knew a kind lady, troubled with the management of a son, who was a pattern of stubbornness, and, strange to say, his mother thought this an admirable trait in his character. I was teaching "young ideas how to shoot," when I called on this lady to talk with her about her children. George was introduced. His mother said,</p> 
               <p>"You will find him a queer boy, sir. He has a great deal of firmness. I never saw a more determined lad. If he takes a notion that I must give him anything, and I refuse, he will threaten to starve himself; and, sir, I have, indeed, known him to go a whole day without eating. I couldn't see him suffer, sir."</p> 
               <p>I looked at the lady with surprise. Her countenance wore a serious expression, and I was to be convinced that she was honest in her opinion of her boy.</p> 
               <p>I was to take tea with her. The table was pread. George stood near the table. He was a sharp-looking boy, about ten years of age. There were some tempting preserves on the table. "May I have some of these, mother?" said the boy, pointing to the preserves.</p> 
               <p>"Not now, my son," answered the mother, mildly.</p> 
               <p>"But I will," he muttered, surlily; and in a moment, when his mother's back was turned, he thrust his fingers into the plate, and, taking a good supply of the fruit, he rushed for the door. Attracted by the noise, his mother saw what he had done, and sprang to catch him. Reckless of consequences, he slammed the door in her face, and, running to the window, placed his thumb upon his nose, and, while he devoured the stolen fruit, made gyrations with his fingers, which declared significantly, "No you didn't, old lady. I beat you that time."</p> 
               <p>The mother smiled, as she looked at her spoiled child in this attitude, and, turning to me, she said,</p> 
               <p>"He is so original-such a character. He ought to be punished for such mischief, but I haven't<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6124-00000039"/> the heart to do it when he is so funny. Do you think you can manage him in school?"</p> 
               <p>I ventured to reply that I had hope, but I felt that her boy's originality would not go unrewarded if I had the care of him. After he had been in school three days I had no trouble with him; but I have known him to go home and pout for an hour, because his mother would not put honey on his cakes for supper. She would hold out as long as her "kind" heart would allow her, and would then gratify the smart child, as the easiest way to <emph>manage</emph> him.</p> 
               <p>Poor woman! her son grew so remarkably smart and original, that, for the public good, it was thought best, that, at public expense, he should be kept where his original conduct could not be patterned after by eccentric or ungoverned youths. The mother died of a broken heart, grieving over the result of that <emph>smartness</emph> in which she encouraged her child.</p>

            <div type="part"> 
                
               <head>NED ELTON.</head> 
               <p>IT would require ponderous tomes to contain the thrilling poetry and eloquent prose that have been written upon the undying influence which a mother can exert over her child, yet it has never been fully told-hearts alone know it, actions alone speak it. The mariner on the "trackless deep"-the hunter in the "far western wilds"-the man in any situation, an exile from home, who loves a pious mother, and thinks of her as he lays himself upon his solitary couch, in the "silent watches of the night," is he, who, most deeply, realizes that impressions made in early youth upon the mind, "like wax to receive and marble to retain," when mothers give pleasant lessons, are as ineffaceable as the impressions of Omnipotent wisdom upon earth and sky, forest and field, ocean and river.</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>"I'll be home again, mother, before another winter, and, if industry can gain it, will have<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6124-00000040"/> something to make you and sister Mary comfortable," said a young man, as he stood on the front steps of a pretty cottage in the suburbs of Cincinnati, holding his mother's and sister's hands. He was about to bid them a long adieu.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Elton was a widow-not a poor widow, for she had a pretty cottage, with handsome grounds, and two dutiful children, Edward and Mary-but Mr. Elton had been in the grave many years-Edward had grown to be a young man, Mary was almost a young lady. Neddy Elton, as his sister called him, knew that his mother was embarrassed for means, by which she intended he should complete his education, without further interruption in teaching, at which, for a support, much of his time had been employed.</p> 
               <p>When the news of the Eldorado of the Pacific reached the States, Edward waited no longer than was necessary to ascertain that the golden reports were well-founded before his determination was formed, and he told his mother that he should become a gold-digger. She remonstrated, depicted the perils and dangers attending the journey, and portrayed the disappointment which might be in store for him at the Mecca of his hopes, but in vain. He joined a company, and prepared for his journey. He had buoyant anticipations, and dwelt glowingly on the change he would make in Linn cottage, when he returned from the Sacramento.</p> 
               <p>"I have faith in you, my son. You will be thrown in bad company, but you will remember my counsels. One thing do not forget-<emph>be temperate.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>These were his mother's parting words-they sank deep into his heart.</p> 
               <p>We need not follow the young adventurer. Crossing the plains he was a leading spirit of the Company, and when he reached the "diggings" was as hardy and happy as any one who travelled with him. By vote of his party, the Sacramento was selected as the scene of operations. It was one of the first bands on this river, and it reaped truly a golden harvest. Elton, in company with a young man named Hernay, who had been a schoolmate, fell upon several very productive <emph>placers,</emph> and astonished their comrades by the weight of their "spoils." Elated with their great success, they were led into bold adventures and severe exposures, and at length both became victims to a prevailing disease, and were compelled to leave the mines.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6124-00000041"/> 
               <p>Proper medical aid was not, at that time, to be had. The only medicine the miners used was a miserable compound called brandy, which sold at an enormous price; but, according to the advice given the ailing young men, it must be had, and their gold dust went freely for it. Elton thought of his mother's last words, "<emph>be temperate,</emph>" but he was taking brandy <emph>only as a medicine,</emph> and there could be no danger. He had no thought of the latent appetite it would awaken-he never fully realized why his mother had ever instructed him, so earnestly, to shun strong drink-he did not know that his father had tottered on the brink of a drunkard's grave, and that in early youth he had mischievously exhibited a desire for spirituous liquors, that was crushed only by the most careful maternal watching.</p> 
               <p>For many days Elton took the medicine carefully, because respect for his mother restrained him. Hernay was not so scrupulous, and he boldly manifested a decided liking for such a tonic. They grew strong, either on account of the rest and quiet they enjoyed, or through the influence of the "<emph>tonic,</emph>" and in less than a month again entered upon the enticing occupation of gold gathering; but this time they worked not as free men-they were the slaves of a dangerous seductive appetite. Elton's "prejudices"-as his companions called his respect for his mother's last words to him-had gradually become weaker until he could tip a glass with as much freedom as any man who worked in the <emph>canons</emph> of the river. He and Hernay <emph>dug</emph> together and drank together until their stock of spirits was exhausted, and then they travelled together to a distant station, and obtained a new supply. All this time their treasure was slipping from them rapidly, and they were adding but little to their store.</p> 
               <p>In less than six months from the period of their illness, Elton and Hernay were a burden to the company, disregarding the golden opportunities offered them, heeding not the warnings that came to them in the loss of their wonted vigor and activity, but making sots of themselves at their own camp, as long as a drop of spirits of any character could be obtained, then working a few days, and seeking, at other camps, the gratification of their destructive appetites.</p> 
               <p>Previous to his illness, Elton had sent, through a man who was returning to the States, a handsome remittance to his mother, with a most gratifying account of his habits, health and prospects.<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6124-00000042"/> He had yet had no word from home, though he had been in California nearly nine months.</p> 
               <p>It was the evening of the anniversary of the arrival of the company at the mines. The diggers had been reckoning the results of their labors; and though all had been very successful in gathering, there were but two of the party who, besides the sums they sent home, were an ounce of gold dust better off than they had been the first week of their life on the Sacramento. Neither of these fortunate diggers was Elton or Hernay, as the reader would judge. A gloom hung over the party, and they were all anxiously waiting the arrival of a messenger who had several days before been dispatched for brandy to a <emph>Ranch</emph> forty or fifty miles down the river.</p> 
               <p>They had hoped he would arrive the night previous, and they began to talk of Indians and foragers, impatient for the commencement of their carouse, when a fellow on guard cried out-</p> 
               <p>"Wake up! boys, here comes the critter."</p> 
               <p>All hands were immediately on the look-out, and in a few minutes the messenger, with his pack-mules and a couple of companions he had obtained at the <emph>Ranch,</emph> was surrounded by the impatient carousers.</p> 
                
               <p>What was the disappointment of the majority when their messenger informed them that he had obtained everything ordered but the "<emph>licker,</emph>" and if they must have a spree, it would be an <hi rend="i"/>aqua-fria from the brook, which flowed near their camp with a current like the "arrowy Rhone." They must forget their disappointment, while they looked over packages of letters he had brought them. There was bustle then to see who had word from home, and the favored ones, for a time did forget their disappointment.</p> 
               <p>Elton had several letters. He walked away from the camp. His steps led him to the brook. It was a lovely night. A full moon was reflected in the clear water, and its silver light glowed on the swift ripples. Elton seated himself upon a jutting point, near the base of a ledge of rocks, and by the light of the "heavenly host" (in that clear atmosphere, abundantly sufficient), read the superscriptions of his letters, till he found one which he knew to be in his mother's hand-writing. The seal was hastily broken, and he read until an unshed tear glistened on his eye-lash. What thoughts of home rushed on his mind! He had been sober for several weeks. What is that which he reads again and again?</p> 
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6124-00000043"/> 
               <p>"My son, how glad I am that you have heeded my parting counsel. I felt that temptation would not overcome your firm principle, and I rejoice to know that you will come home to us, as you left us, free from vices which you have been taught are most dangerous in strict moderation, and debasing, beyond the expression of any language I can use, in excess."</p> 
               <p>Like a flood rushed over Elton's mind the tender teachings his mother had given him, from the time he first understood the lullaby, to which his cradle was rocked, until he had parted from her under solemn counsel. Then came up a review of his life in the mines-how his mother's free confidence reproached him. He repeated the extract again and again; and when he had thought calmly of his duty, he looked up to the sky, and with a fervor, as if the stars were the eyes of angels gazing down upon him, he uttered-</p> 
               <p>"As I live, I will <emph>not</emph> abuse such confidence."</p> 
               <p>For an hour he sat on the rocks, thinking of his home, and revolving his plans; then he walked slowly back to the camp, and sought his "boon companion."</p> 
               <p>"Hernay," said he, "you must not drink another drop of liquor."</p> 
                
               <p>"I don't think I shall just now; but if Ben had not returned with an empty cask, I reckon you would have seen, before this, how <emph>temperate</emph> I can be-"</p> 
               <p>"But I am in earnest, Hernay."</p> 
               <p>"To be sure you are."</p> 
               <p>"I mean, that if there were a hundred barrels of the best old brandy in camp that ever came from the States, you should not taste a drop."</p> 
               <p>"And how would you prevent me?"</p> 
               <p>"By my example."</p> 
               <p>"That's rich. You are getting witty, Ned. Anything in those letters that whetted your wit?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Tom, there <emph>is</emph> something here that whetted my wit, and I have determined not to drink any more of the infernal stuff we get, called brandy. I am in earnest, as I live, and you <emph>must</emph> join me."</p> 
               <p>"I'll keep sober as long as you will, Ned, and I'll be drunk on the first liquor that comes into camp."</p> 
               <p>"Will you agree not to drink any of the poison till I do?"</p> 
               <p>"I will, 'pon honor."</p> 
               <p>"Give me your hand."</p> 
               <p>The two friends shook hands heartily, and walked together to their tent.</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6124-00000044"/> 
               <p>On the morrow, a party of men passed the camp, before the diggers had gone to work, and as they were well supplied with "necessaries" from San Francisco, a small quantity of spirits was obtained from them, and it was not over an hour before the <emph>grand carnival</emph> commenced.</p> 
               <p>Upon a rude bench, beneath their weather-beaten tent, sat seven or eight of the miners, and while the jug of "medicine" passed freely around, they talked bravely of their intentions and prospects. Presently it was discovered that two of the party were missing, Elton and Hernay.</p> 
               <p>"Where are the fellows?" asked a rough-spoken miner.</p> 
               <p>"At the brook," answered another. "We shall have no fun out of Elton to-day. The letters he got yesterday have made a baby of him, and his shadow, Hernay, has caught the infection."</p> 
               <p>"Here he comes," cried out a third one of the party, pointing towards the brook. "I'll answer for him, that he's the drunkest man in the crowd afore night-and what could we do on a spree, without Ned?"</p> 
               <p>At this moment Elton and Hernay entered the tent, and the man who happened to have the jug sprang to his feet, and familiarly taking the former by the collar, exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"They've been lying about you, Ned. Come, show them, in a good swig, that you are a man yet."</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> show them that I am a man, but by letting that stuff alone," pushing back the jug proffered him.</p> 
               <p>"That's well done, Ned," cried several voices, sneeringly.</p> 
               <p>"I am in earnest, boys," returned Elton, with a dignity of manner he well knew how to assume, "and you know <emph>me</emph> well enough to believe, that when I deliberately resolve upon a thing, I'll put it through."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what's the matter, Ned?" said the man who pushed the jug at him.</p> 
               <p>"What's the matter? Everything's the matter. I have been in these mines one year. I have dug a great deal of gold. Except a few hundred dollars worth sent home, what have I to show? Nothing-nothing but a bloated face! How many of you are any better off? Why is this? There's the cause," pointing significantly at one of the men who was just taking a drink. "A great <emph>medicine</emph> it has been to us. With gold in abundance about<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6124-00000045"/> us, not one of the party is worth five hundred dollars, and those that have anything, owe it more to their skill at gaming, than their industry in digging. We had been all rich, if we had all been sober. When we could not get liquor we did well. When liquor came, our treasure vanished. Is this what our friends expected of us? Some of you got letters from home yesterday. Did they read as if your mothers and sisters thought, that away in this rich country we were poor sots?-mine <emph>did not!</emph> I have determined never to go back home, till I can take enough gold dust to make me rich, and I am going home before the wet season sets in. Hernay has joined me. How many of my companions will cut the acquaintance of this jug, and do something for themselves?"</p> 
               <p>The men were taken by surprise. They felt the force of what Elton had said, they thought of their homes in the States, and four of them came forward, and took the California temperance lecturer by the hand, saying-</p> 
               <p>"We are with you, Ned."</p> 
               <p>"Let's have a temperance society, and make Ned the president. I can draw up a pledge," said Hernay, "because I was a Washingtonian in the States."</p> 
                
               <p>"Agreed!" was the response from several voices.</p> 
               <p>"Death to the enemy," cried Hernay; and, "suiting the action to the word," he snatched up the half empty jug of "mixture," and hurled it against a large rock lying near the tent.</p> 
               <p>Among the conveniences put up for Ned, by his mother, was a writing apparatus. This was forthwith produced, and Hernay drew up a pledge to suit the circumstances of the party. Elton signed it, and his five converts followed his example immediately; and then they began to labor with their companions. Before night twelve names were on the pledge.</p> 
               <p>In a day or two the news of this strange organization spread to other camps in the vicinity, and before seven days had rolled around, the California Temperance Society numbered twenty-five members.</p> 
               <p>Such was the origin of the first total abstinence society in the gold diggings.</p> 
               <p>At the time "nominated in the bond," Elton and his friends took their departure from San Francisco for New York, in one of the first steamships which made the passage. They had been very successful. Luck led them into a number of rich <emph>gulches,</emph> and all who had kept their pledge against<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6124-00000046"/> gambling and drinking returned home with a competency.</p> 
               <p>Where stood widow Elton's cottage, when Ned started for California, may now be seen a large and handsome mansion. We will take a glance at the family, as they all appear at the front door.</p> 
               <p>The matronly old lady, who bids a young couple good evening, is widow Elton. The young couple are Mr. and Mrs. Edward Elton. They have just returned in the carriage, which stands in front of the gate, from a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Hernay. But where is Mary Elton? Mr. Hernay can answer, and Ned Elton can tell you, my reader, if you are curious, that, in taking a wife, "a fair exchange of <emph>sisters</emph> is not robbery."</p>

               <head>LITTLE CHIP.</head> 
               <p>IT gives me pleasure always to call up recollections of the early youth of a playmate, known among her acquaintances as "Little Chip." She was timid as a young bird that has never left the parent nest; but when among her intimate friends was as restless as a caged sparrow, and was always singing and chirping; hence her nickname "Chipbird," which, familiarized among her playmates, became "Little Chip."</p> 
               <p>As tender to impressions as the summer plants she nurtured, her open heart trembled at the mention of every youthful exploit which, in the slightest degree, brought harm to the meanest worm or insect; and her companions respected her loving gentleness so much, that they all strove, with sensitive sympathy, to avoid every word or act that would wound her delicate feelings.</p> 
               <p>During a ramble in the woods, if a rude boy should disturb the harmony and quiet of a colony<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6124-00000047"/> of ants, Little Chip would complain bitterly, and never leave the spot till, in all possible ways, she had endeavored to repair the injury. Were a bird wounded, Little Chip took it in charge. She seemed to enjoy herself the highest when ministering to the comfort of creatures helpless and likely to die without fostering care. The boys never quarrelled violently when Little Chip was one of the company. She would plead so earnestly and tenderly for the wranglers to make friends, that none could resist her. All disputes between the school-girls were settled by Little Chip. Her kindness, gentleness, tenderness, and justness were like embodied angels-sent to promote good feeling and loving harmony among all who had her confidence.</p> 
               <p>Nobody "named her but to praise;" and many a parent thought, with quickening feelings, of the home comfort her father and mother must take in her obedient goodness, ever manifest. Her mother watched over her angel-child with a degree of care and anxiety only equalled by that florist who should have a passion for the shrinking mimosa, and undertake to protect it from all such influences as might close its petals. But, poor Little Chip! she was to lose this kind mother's vigilant care. She was ten years old when her mother died, and a maiden aunt-her father's sister-became her guardian. Under her mother's teaching, while she lost none of her gentleness and goodness, she was so instructed as to guard her sensitive nature against injuries, springing from causes over which she could have no foresight or control; but her aunt was a stern, fearless woman, and the little Chip-bird found her home an eyrie, belonging to an eagle, strong of wing, that would have taken the wee birdling and made bold sweeps into the broad sky-an eagle that loved to teach young birds to fly, but wished them as strong as herself; and when wing and courage failed them, thought that to strengthen both, vivid pictures of the power of swift-winged hawks, of lurking animals, and skillful sportsmen were required.</p> 
               <p>The rugged aunt had no sympathy with her sensitive niece; and to make the child as fearless as herself, it was her policy to teach her, by exposure, that her timidity was groundless. Every command was enforced by some threat, which stimulated the child's terror; and soon Little Chip became so weak and fearful a thing, that it was irksome to her companions to have her with them in their jovial sports; but still she was the same<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6124-00000048"/> gentle, loving bird, and no one could intentionally do aught to make her feel that she was not always welcome to every opportunity for enjoyment. She needed encouragement and sympathy, and her companions felt and contributed to her need.</p> 
               <p>One evening she was beguiled at play till the hour for returning home had passed. At length, awakened to her neglect of her aunt's commands, she hastened towards her father's house with a heart trembling as does that of a young fawn when, for the first time, its swift enemy, the hound, bays upon its track.</p> 
               <p>Her father was absent, and the aunt had a fair opportunity to test her plan of overcoming Little Chip's childish fears. She met the truant at the front door, and, as the honest child approached, with downcast look, and the words of confession on her lip, the silly woman cried:</p> 
               <p>"No! I'll not excuse you. I'll shut you up. I'm going out this evening; you shall stay in the dark till I get back; and if you make a bit of noise, that great monster I've told you about so often shall take you off."</p> 
               <p>Poor little Chip! fear-chills crept over her, and she cried as if her heart would break; but her sobs had no effect upon her governess. She was led into the dark room, and left with this admonition:</p> 
               <p>"Now, mind you be quiet, or you'll be taken off, and your father wouldn't like to lose his Little Chip."</p> 
               <p>Very thoughtless, and very cruel it was thus to leave this child with an indefinable fear creeping over her-a dread of some shadowy shape, that was to rob her father of his little Bird, occupying her timorous heart. She crept into a corner, and buried her face in her hands, and wept and trembled, as she never had wept and trembled before. The silence and darkness of the room weighed upon her; now she would open her fingers, and strain her eyes, to peer through the darkness, as if she wished to know if there were, indeed, a monster in the room; then she would clasp her hands and tremble, and the beating of her heart could have been heard at any point in the apartment.</p> 
               <p>She had been alone an hour, when she thought she heard footsteps in the hall, then she fancied some one had touched the door. For an instant she hoped it was her father, coming to release her, and she felt an impulse to bound to meet him. A shuffling sound struck her ear; she thought the door opened, yet she saw no object. In an agony<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6124-00000049"/> of fear, she threw herself upon the floor, and hid her face. Again the shuffling sound fell upon her ear, and, with a convulsive movement, she started back. A monster, with glaring eyeballs, illuminating a hideous face-in her eyes, frightful beyond the conception of the calm imagination-stood before her. With a scream, wild and terrible, expressing, in its weird-like tone and furious energy, the full terror of her heart, the little Chip-bird sunk powerless to the floor.</p> 
               <p>It was but an instant before the father, calling his child, rushed through the hall. He had just entered the house. Lights were promptly obtained, and Little Chip was found alone.</p> 
               <p>How that father's heart bled when he lifted his child from the floor, as helpless as if her gentle spirit had been frightened from its feeble tenement; but the tender bird was not dead. Better she had been. If the spirit was not frightened away, its alarm had been so intense, that intelligent communication between it and the frame in which it dwelt was destroyed, and loving, gentle little Chip was a helpless creature, having only the capacity to look, with eloquent tenderness, into the eyes of those who approached her, and beg with trembling accents.</p> 
                
               <p>"You'll not let the big thing hurt me! Don't put me in the dark, will you?"</p> 
               <p>Her tones were so plaintive, her gentleness so touching, that all the tender-hearted who came in contact with her wept bitterly over her misfortunes.</p> 
               <p>What of those who had been the instruments in so frightening her timid spirit that her child-like reason was dethroned? The apparition that entered the dark room in which Little Chip had been a prisoner was a mischievous boy, dressed for the purpose, who had often heard Little Chip's aunt threaten her with the "big thing," and he thought to have a little fun by putting the stern aunt's threat into execution. He had no intention of harm further than frightening the timid bird. He did no more harm than to frighten her; but the fearful consequence of that fright! It made the boy almost a maniac. So deep was his contrition, that Little Chip's grieved father mourned for him instead of feeling a spirit of vengeance toward him.</p> 
               <p>What of the aunt? Little Chip never saw her but she cried, in such piteous tones as would melt the sternest heart.</p> 
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6124-00000050"/> 
               <p>"Don't, aunt! <emph>don't</emph> let that big thing get me! You won't, <emph>will</emph> you, aunt!"</p> 
               <p>Then she would look up into her aunt's eyes, and cling to her with a shudder; and the woman who had thought to overcome her niece's timidity by exposing it to trial, would weep with, and strive to soothe the timorous lunatic, while her heart bled to think of the fearful outrage she had inflicted upon her tender nature. She would have given her own life to have restored Little Chip to the place she once occupied in the family. She watched her, soothed her, and endeavored, in all other possible ways, to recall her wandering reason; but in vain. The gentle spirit fretted itself free from the trammels of clay, and, in about two years, went to a home where its loving kindness met many a kindred charm, and where are no frights nor fears-no cruelties-no torments to make the heart, too sensitive of wrong, suffer from shadowy fear or bleed for ignorant injustice.</p> 
               <p>The aunt never forgave herself for her wrong to the gentle Little Chip. She was a martyr to false ideas-ideas which have been the cause of very great wrong in many families.</p> 
               <p>Too many parents hold to this woman's false philosophy. Let them remember, that though they may frighten a child into obedience, it is not governed-only frightened, and that fright is a blight upon the spirit, whose effects remain evident for a lifetime.</p>

               <head>MY FIRST LESSON IN "MANLINESS."</head> 
               <p>WHAT grown-up boy, who knew anything of society in his juvenile days, does not remember, vividly, his earnest longings to be a man-to be his own master? How weary in its march seemed the period from one birthday to another, when he regarded these anniversaries as steps in his progress toward boyish ambition's great goal-the number of years necessary to constitute an individual of the masculine gender, a "<emph>sovereign,</emph>" one of <emph>the</emph> people, a <emph>man,</emph> master of his own time, his own money, and lord over his own-what shall we call them? peccadilloes?</p> 
               <p>Nobody could then say to him, throw away that cigar, check that oath, pitch that plug of tobacco into the fire, or cast that glass of brandy out of the window-oh! what a glorious thing to be a MAN! But where are the MEN?-heard of in some far distant country? Not a few men now-a-days are like the column built by the sun's rays, when they fall through the interstices of a heavily-laden cloud: massive, mighty, when seen from afar, but insignificant when we approach near enough to define its character. Not that there are no <emph>truly</emph> great men, only that, in the sober judgment of "big boys," they do not comprise a majority of the population, even in America, where every man has an equal chance to make the most of himself.</p> 
               <p>Who that ever used the filthy weed yclept tobacco, has forgotten his first attempt at "manliness" in the <emph>chewing</emph> line. I remember my debut on this stage of folly very distinctly.</p> 
               <p>Father chewed, the men that worked for father smoked <emph>and</emph> chewed, the schoolmaster had a quid in his mouth when he <emph>heard</emph> our lessons. Why might not we take a chew when we <emph>recited</emph> lessons? The schoolmaster was a jolly fellow; he loved other "luxuries," as well as tobacco.</p> 
               <p>It was a hot day in July, the schoolmaster had taken a stiff julep; he actually fell asleep in his chair. There was a carpenter-shop hard by; an armful of long shavings was obtained; in a few moments, pendant from various portions of the pedagogue's slumbering person hung the pine curls. It was rare sport; the school was in an uproar.</p> 
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6124-00000052"/> 
               <p>"Who don't want to be a man?" cried one saucy fellow; "let us take a '<emph>chaw</emph>' all round of the schoolmaster's tobacco."</p> 
               <p>The "weed" was filched, and several of the bravest and most ambitious boys filled their mouths. It was a nauseous dose for me; it makes me shudder to think of it now, but other boys "chawed," and so must I.</p> 
               <p>Partially aroused from his stupor by the "noise and confusion" in his "kingdom," the man of "birch" shook his "ambrosial curls," and gave a "significant nod" towards his desk. His appearance was so ludicrous that half a dozen boys yelled with laughter. Oh! unlucky fate: the pedagogue started to his feet. Seized with fright, what did I, to disguise my activity in the pending "festivities," but swallow the roll of cavendish I had deposited in my mouth! Horror! What a yearning there was presently under my waistcoat. The schoolmaster, considerate soul, well satisfied that the fun his scholars had at his expense, was of his own seeking, dismissed the school without inquiring for the leading "spirits" of the jollification. But what was all this kind consideration to me, whose receptacle for the staff of life heaved as if the lower deposits had been metamorphosed into yeast of an excellent character for prompt rising. The grand offender was soon "brought to light;" but the dreadful sickness it occasioned did not "come up" with it. Home I <emph>must</emph> go, and my sympathizing mother <emph>must</emph> know how sick her boy was; but did she ascertain the cause? Not a bit of it. It was a sudden attack, threatened to be serious: the family physician was called. That night I took an "awful" dose of calomel, and the following morning I gulphed castor oil enough to grease a threshing machine. For three days I was a poor, pitied, penitent patient. Wasn't I a martyr to "<emph>manliness?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Did this experience satisfy me? Not quite. A majority of the boys in school frequently presented the spectacle, which somebody has described as a "roll of tobacco with fire at one end, and a fool at the other." I was solicited to make a "smoke-consumer" of my breathing apparatus. For some time I braved temptation nobly, but taunted as a coward, I finally yielded; and then didn't I take in sickness as a calf takes in sustenance? I lolled upon a cellar-door, in a hot July sun; and I imagined the inclination of my couch reversed, and oh! how fearfully did I dread sliding into some fearful abyss, around which floated vapors composed<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6124-00000053"/> posed of the most approved ingredients for conveying such sensations as the wonderful whale which gave Jonah a dwelling place, must have had at a certain period in its important history. My companions laughed heartily at the vigorous manner in which I gave to mother earth all I had received from her <foreign xml:lang="LAT">via</foreign> the dinner table, but they consoled me by declaring-</p> 
               <p>"Never mind, that's the way it fixed all of us at first; keep on and you'll enjoy it."</p> 
               <p>I thought I must be a man. I cared naught for martyrdom. I "kept on," and I did enjoy it. I who aspired to manliness, became a slave to smoke! What a fall was there! That which had so unpleasantly disturbed the results of my dinner-table exercises, became so familiar a companion that on several occasions the knife which conveyed wholesome food to my mouth, came in contact with an "old soger" resting between my teeth, to the existence of which I had become oblivious. Smoking was a besetting sin: I was smoking myself into a condition which would soon have left me a second skeleton-Edson-I found I was indeed a martyr. I pitched cigars-to the dogs? no sir! but out of my catalogue of "luxuries;" and now I am a free man; not altogether, yet, for the bewitching exhilaration of a <emph>good</emph> cigar still haunts me; and in lonely hours I often think that one half dime invested in tobacco leaves, would secure smoke, around which might be wreathed many pleasing fancies; but then, the recollection of my serious martyrdom comes to my aid, and cigars are declared decidedly a nuisance.</p> 
               <p>He who knows the luxury of a cigar, knows the tyranny of habit, and though the vice may be a small one, we cannot but consider him a martyr who indulges it, chiefly because in most instances it connects with it habits which no gentleman can regard among the <emph>accomplishments</emph> that should be recognized in the "first circles" of society.</p>

               <head>WIDOW CLIFF AND HER SON.</head> 
               <p>SOME years ago I was a resident of a quiet village, in which half a dozen boys, from twelve to sixteen years of age, stood heirs to the first position in the genteel society of the town. The leader among the lads was a deacon's son; his most intimate friend was the minister's eldest boy; another was the "hopeful" of the most popular among the village physicians; the fourth was the "prop" of the household of a pious widow; the fifth was the pride of the wealthiest merchant of the town; and the sixth was a country lad of rare promise, who boarded with the schoolmaster.</p> 
               <p>Never was an orchard robbed, a melon-patch disturbed, a sign changed, or a bee-hive rifled of its sweets, that some one of these boys could not give full particulars of all the hair-breadth escapes attending the exploit. It was these boys who devised the stretching of strings across the sidewalks, on dark nights, for the purpose of throwing to the ground all careless pedestrians; they were the fellows who fastened a piece of twine to the bell-handle at the door of the village hotel, tied ears of corn to this twine, in the dusk of evening drove up the pigs, and caused the lazy ostler, amid mutterings both loud and deep, to run after "false alarms."</p> 
               <p>Was anybody's door step removed of a dark night to some out-of-the-way alley, one of these boys could always tell who played the prank. Was there a political gathering, a Fourth of July celebration, or a boat-launch, these boys were foremost in the ranks of young "patriots," who entertain the idea that he who can make way with the greatest number of glasses of wine or porter is the "<emph>best man!</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Temperance societies were in vogue in those days. Nobody drank spirits, but every body had the privilege of taking as much wine, beer, or cider, as seemed to him or her advisable, and the temperance pledge was never broken. It was fashionable for old folks to sip wine, for young folks to drink malt beer. The boys knew that when their fathers met to talk over church affairs the elderly gentlemen also discussed the merits of the deacon's or minister's port wine; and they<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6124-00000055"/> were unwilling to see any reason why, when they met to lay their plans for the prosecution of sport, they might not just as well discuss the merits of the village brewer's beer. Amazing fond grew their fathers of rare old port, and amazing fond grew they of nut-brown ale and foaming beer. Sometimes, when they had plenty of beer, they did not have enough examples of good moral conduct, such as their fathers recommended; but fashionable they must be; and when they heard bold men roll out ominous oaths, they felt that there was some "pomp and circumstance" in such boldness, and it soon became easy for them to mouth the "cheek-distending oath" with as little ceremony as the bravest of their grown-up companions. Of course, their parents knew naught of this "progress." Other boys less bold witnessed their "rise in the world," and envied their independence, and were often inclined to take such measures as might have put a check upon their sinful growth; but were they not leaders in all the village sports and pastimes, and who dare say they dare not swear? They wore the finest clothes of any boys in the town; they attended Sabbath school, and were seldom missed at church, if they did often miss the sermon on account of the necessity sity of attending to their dreams; and if once in a while it did happen that one of them was so careless as to get more beer in the region covered by his waistcoat than was compatible with the quiet of his head, did he not have a patent of respectability in the position of his parents; and what cared he for any "slant" an envious "plebeian" might hurl at him.</p> 
               <p>These boys were sent to bed without their suppers if they neglected family prayers; were severely whipped if they played truant from school; were obliged to commit the Shorter Catechism to memory; and were under the "disagreeable necessity" of attending not only Sabbath-day sermons, but various weekly prayer meetings; and here their moral and religious instruction ended. They "went it" each on his own hook after this. What was the result? I will take one case to illustrate the whole, showing, as I proceed, what exceptions there were to this case.</p> 
               <p>Nelson Cliff was the jolliest and bravest, the wittiest and most generous boy of the "crowd." He was the widow's son. He was as reckless as he was good-humored, and was well skilled in all the accomplishments necessary to constitute him a leading member of the "first society." It was<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6124-00000056"/> determined that he should have an education. He attended school faithfully, and made such progress in his lessons as won the heart of his teacher. His mother destined him for the ministry; and she was, what she considered, as watchful of his principles as a mother could be. It was the rule of her house, that Nelson should have but half an hour for play between school hours; that he should be at home to read the Bible for family worship at seven o'clock each evening; that he should retire to rest at nine; and that half of the day on Saturday he should read to her from the writings of the fathers in the Church. On the Sabbath he was always his mother's attendant at church. He was free and jovial; his mother was rigid, sedate, and distant. Whenever his buoyant nature expressed itself in rippling gladness in her presence, he suffered severe reproof. His genial heart was "cribbed, cabined, and confied" at home. He loved his mother, but she was no companion for him. Her object seemed to be to teach him to wear on his countenance the sober expression of one who had suffered a lifetime of sorrow. How often did he wish for a sister who would be his playmate, in whom he could confide; but he was an only child, and the solace he sighed for at home he was obliged to seek abroad. Often, when his mother was sound asleep, at the dead hour of midnight, did his companions arouse him by a concerted signal, and he would join them and carouse till daybreak. He had rather suffered the amputation of his right arm, than had his mother informed of these disobediences; and although her neighbors knew that Nelson deceived her, that she was treasuring hopes destined to be blighted, no one informed her till it was too late-then she saw for herself. Nelson was one evening absent. His mother walked her room in fear that some accident had befallen him-that he had fallen into bad company-the latter suspicion was well grounded. His habits of clandestine enjoyment had grown so strong upon him, that he was induced to go with his companions, after school, to an oyster supper. He intended to be at home before seven o'clock. It was nine, and he came not; at ten he was borne home, brutally intoxicated. His mother did not then utter a word of reproach; her heart was too full. In that hour did she learn, that for nearly two years Nelson's life had been one continued deceit. She reproached her neighbors with their remissness; but they told her that charity had forbidden them to speak, hoping that, when Nelson<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6124-00000057"/> grew older, he would reform. Then she wept, with feelings a mother only can understand; her tears fell upon Nelson's bloated face, but he knew it not. Had he been himself, how his heart would have leaped to sympathize with the feeling which brought tears to his mother's eyes for his sake!</p> 
               <p>On the morrow he was summoned to meet his stern mother. He came with shame written upon his countenance; his head hung low; he would have fallen upon his knees, and begged his mother's forgiveness, promising to sin no more: he waited with beating heart, for one word of sympatizing encouragement. Had the mother wept then, and but said "my son," with a sob, all had been well. Nelson summoned courage to steal one glance at his mother's face. Its expression was stern, forbidding, and reproachful. He was told how he had disgraced himself and his home; how he had abused his mother's confidence, blasted her hopes, and insulted his father's memory; but he received no word of kind counsel; he alone was responsible; he alone was guilty. He went from his mother's presence unchanged; he resolved to grieve her no more, but his resolution was weak. There was a gulf between them. One kind thought, gently spoken, would have bridged that gulf, but that thought, nursed on either side, was never expressed, and the gulf widened.</p> 
               <p>It was not many months before Nelson absented himself from family worship; then he neglected sabbath school; and, finally, his seat at the village church was often vacant. His mother's health failed, and her increase of ills augmented her natural sternness of character. Her friends grieved for her, but their sympathy could not so minister to her sufferings that her grief was relieved.</p> 
               <p>For a week Nelson Cliff had not been seen in the village. It was reported that his mother had sent him to a distant school, to remove him from the evil associations of his youth; but his companions knew that he had told his mother he could no longer stay at home, and she had given him money, and bid him go and reform. He refused the money, but he went from his native village as one who has been guilty of a heinous crime-secretly-shunning the knowledge of all, except a few intimate friends.</p> 
               <p>Was not this boy's mother a martyr? Had she known the generous nature of her son, had she understood his genial, honest character, how much sadness, "which no tongue can express," might she have been saved! But she was to know that he,<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6124-00000058"/> of whom she could scarcely think with calmness, was not the base wretch she imagined.</p> 
               <p>Ten years elapsed, and Nelson Cliff returned to his native village. He had gone into the world like an Ishmaelite. He returned another man. For six years he ran a round of dissipation, and was on the brink of ruin, when he met one who was to him more than a sister. He told her the story of his life; their hearts became one; she begged him to write his mother, asking forgiveness. He poured out his soul to her from whom he had been so long estranged; the gulf between them was bridged; the mother saw how she had wronged her son; and when Nelson was twenty-seven years of age, the mother met her boy with an understanding, an appreciation of his character for the first time. Nelson was not a preacher; but the mother had two children now-one had been found during Nelson's estrangement, and had been the instrument of reconciliation, and the mother was recompensed.</p> 
               <p>Where were Nelson's companions-his five boon fellows? Two of them had died prematurely on account of the habits which drove him from his home; the minister's son, like him, had been obliged to leave the paternal roof; one was wandering dering, his friends knew not whither, and the fifth was known as the village sot.</p> 
               <p>Cliff met him as a brother, told him of his triumph over appetites that had degraded him, and urged him to be a man; but such advice reached the miserable man at an hour when he felt himself an irreclaimable outcast, and in a few years he died a drunkard, after having squandered such a fortune as would have educated half the indigent children of the township.</p> 
               <p>Were not the parents of all these boys martyrs to false systems? There are now such fathers in every community, but they are not as numerous as they were fifteen years ago. People are everywhere beginning to teach their children as if they felt that there was a living morality, as well as a religion of forms-that it is more profitable to give some time to the rational culture of youthful mind, than to exhaust every energy in the pursuit of wealth, and leave children to be educated only so far as restrained compliance with the forms, customs, and fashions of society may demand.</p>

               <head>AN ODD MUSIC LESSON.</head> 
               <p>PITT HENRY was a boy of some genius. He was fond of fun and fond of music. His father bought him a small fife, and he went "tooting" about the house, filling it with "martial airs," till his mother took the instrument of "spirit-stirring" tones and threw it in the fire. Pitt was sedate a few days, but soon managed to console himself with an old accordeon which one of his companions lent him. His ambition was to possess a violin. Fourth of July came round-the boys were all shooting crackers and firing pistols, and Pitt had a small cannon with which he was waking patriotic echoes along a narrow street, when a playmate, who owned a violin, happened to join the crowd in which Pitt's booming "field-piece" formed a wonder; and being ambitious to take rank as a youth imbued with the spirit of '76, he offered Pitt the violin for the cannon. Pitt took him at his word, and gave him what ammunition he had into the bargain.</p> 
                
               <p>Forthwith the young Paganini deserted those who were celebrating the <emph>Fourth,</emph> and retiring to an out of the way room, in his father's house, he labored diligently to perform such snatches of familiar tunes as he had been in the habit of extorting from the accordeon.</p> 
               <p>Many parents would have been well satisfied with Pitt's exchange of a cannon for a violin, but not so with Mrs. Henry. She regarded a violin as an instrument devised for the encouragement of the devices of the devil, and Pitt's squealing attempts at negro melodies were soon declared a nuisance. He would be led into bad company. He must not be allowed to play a violin; but no effort was made to turn his attention to a different instrument, to give him any encouragement toward the development of his musical talent. He could only play when his mother was absent, or when he could steal away from home, with his fiddle under his arm, and meet a few companions, who had formed a miniature band. They often went out serenading. Pitt wished to go with them; his mother forbade him. She told him the company was not suitable for a boy who would be respectable-which, in a great measure, was true-but knowing that the boy must have companions<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6124-00000060"/> nions-would have amusements-did she seek to introduce him to better company, or did she endeavor to make his home attractive-to interest him in books and music <emph>at home?</emph> Not a bit of it. His home sport was a nuisance. No man who ever played the fiddle was better than a vagabond.</p> 
               <p>Pitt's father often expressed himself in favor of getting a master to give the boy lessons on the violin, but Mrs. Henry said:</p> 
               <p>"Not for the world; it would make him a vagabond."</p> 
               <p>So the poor boy was compelled to seek clandestine enjoyment. His companions often urged him to accompany them on their evening rambles, giving serenades about town. His mother had forbidden him, and for a long time he zealously refused to meet the boys at night.</p> 
               <p>One day he begged his mother to let him buy a music-book with some money he had earned for the purpose, by doing chores for neighbors.</p> 
               <p>"What kind of a music-book?" she inquired.</p> 
               <p>"A fiddle-book," answered Pitt. His mother was not in a pleasant humor, and she answered sharply:</p> 
               <p>"You had better throw your money in the cistern tern; and if I hear any more about that fiddle, I'll throw it in the fire."</p> 
               <p>Pitt's heart was heavy to think that pleasure should be so unreasonably denied him. He could see no force in his mother's objections. He could not but feel that her denial was given to put upon him a sort of penance, and in this mood he sought his companions. He found them preparing for a grand serenade that night. They besought him to go with them. For some time he stood out bravely, but at length, thinking that his father and mother were to be absent that evening, and feeling that a little recreation would repay him for the denials he had suffered, hoping to be at home before his parents, he consented. His companions were in high glee, for he was a jovial lad.</p> 
               <p>About half-past nine o'clock that evening, a tamborine, "the bones,"a fiddle, and a triangle were heard in concert near the corner of a street in the town where Pitt Henry resided. A gentleman and lady promenading the street heard the music, and the lady said:</p> 
               <p>"I shouldn't wonder if Pitt was among those boys. I wish you would go and see, Mr. Henry."</p> 
               <p>Poor Pitt! "the wheels of time flew swiftly round," and he had not yet thought of going<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6124-00000061"/> home. Mr. Henry found him with his face blackened, singing- <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"There was an old nigger,</l> 
                        <l>And his name was Uncle Ned,"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> and accompanying himself on the violin, in a manner which would have done credit to one who had more experience. The song came to a dead "rest" at the words, <q>
                     <l>"He had no wool on the top of his head,"</l>
                  </q> and Pitt stood abashed before his father. He started for home, but not with his violin-this Mr. Henry took in charge. He remembered how much trouble there had been in regard to it about the house. He looked at it intently; unpleasant recollections thronged his mind; the simple instrument became a thing of living evil in his eyes, and when he entered his house, calling Pitt to him, he held it up before the family and broke it to pieces with his cane.</p> 
               <p>"I would not have broken it, Mr. Henry," said Pitt's mother. "You might have sold it."</p> 
               <p>On that hour a spirit of rebellion was born in Pitt Henry's heart. He never again regarded his mother with the same confidence he had previously given her. The whole history of his violin rose up before him. He went to bed and wept bitterly.</p> 
                
               <p>On the morrow, when Pitt met his companions, he honestly told them of his misfortunes, and one of them said,</p> 
               <p>"What'll you do now for a fiddle, Pitt?"</p> 
               <p>Toney Fenton has one, and I'll play it, I'll bet you, when neither father nor mother will know it," answered Pitt, with a feeling of bravado he had never before so decidedly manifested.</p> 
               <p>In the next three months, often was he out at night, serenading; and often did he fall into company from which he learned habits, his violin-playing at home would never have brought him in contact with. His mother many times expressed herself glad that he no longer seemed to have a passion after a fiddle; but she discovered in him a spirit of disobedience for which she could not account.</p> 
               <p>It was about six months after Pitt's violin had been demolished that a circus visited the town. Pitt attended several times, without the knowledge of his parents. The second night after the circus company "pulled up stakes," Pitt Henry and one of his companions were missing. A boy told Pitt's father that he had heard him talking about going with the circus, and Mrs. Henry, when this came to her ears, cried-</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6124-00000062"/> 
               <p>"There, didn't I tell you? You see what letting him have that violin has brought us to!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Henry, in thought, differed widely from his wife, but he was too much grieved to reply sharply, and he answered this reflection by saying-</p> 
               <p>"We'll not quarrel about the cause now. Let us correct the evil."</p> 
               <p>The runaways were readily found, and Pitt was glad to go home. His father received him kindly, for he had learned a lesson upon which he resolved to act; but Mrs. Henry could see nothing but ugliness in Pitt's disposition to be away from home; and from day to day her son lost more of that affection for his mother, which makes parent and child confidants, and which causes the care of one and the obedience of the other, to spring from a higher and holier sentiment than that of mere duty and respect.</p>

               <head>TOM TOPERLY.</head> 
               <p>TOM TOPERLY was the veriest sot in all the town. He had been a great many things besides a toper, but he had always been a toper-that is, as long as he had been at all, or, at least, since he was ten years of age, which period, at the date of our biography, was distant about fifteen of the earth's revolutions around its orbit.</p> 
               <p>Tom had derived his patronymic from an ancestry which, probably, at some ancient era, had won the significant appellation for exploits in the line that had made him famous.</p> 
               <p>Tom had been leniently "passed through" all the Temperance Orders and Societies that had sprung up in his neighborhood, and he had come out as much of a sot as he went in-and more so, if allowance was not made for lapse of time.</p> 
               <p>Tom had always been a bachelor, perhaps because he had never been sober long enough to seek out a wife, and perchance because he was so much of a locomotive demijohn, that no woman<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6124-00000063"/> could have been found foolish enough to "link her fate to his."</p> 
               <p>Tom had arrived at an era in his "eventful life" when he was too shiftless to work even for gin, his <emph>favorite</emph> beverage, and there began to be talk that the poor-house would have to shelter him, when, one night, he miraculously disappeared. He was so well known about town, that everybody missed him, and there was general inquiry as to his mysterious fate, but no tidings came.</p> 
               <p>It was on the fifth day after his elopement when Tom "turned up" on the steps of a tavern, about ten miles removed from the town of his nativity. He was penniless, and the landlord had turned him out of doors. He was as sober as ever he had been in his life. A man in a rough farmer's coat saw him, and, tapping him on the shoulder, said-</p> 
               <p>"What are you doing here, my man?"</p> 
               <p>"Waitin' for some fellow to ask me to drink. May be you're the chap," was Tom's answer.</p> 
               <p>The rough-looking man smiled, and replied-"You look as if you had taken drink enough in your life."</p> 
               <p>"I'm orful dry; haven't had a drop to-day, 'pon honor," resumed Tom, with a woful face, as he smacked his lips, and drew his dirty coat-cuff across his mouth.</p> 
               <p>"If I will find you as much as you can drink, will you go with me?" inquired the gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and stay with you," answered Tom, "till the stock is out," springing with some show of agility to his feet.</p> 
               <p>"Get into my wagon, then," said the gentleman.</p> 
               <p>"With pleasure, sir," said Tom, as he clambered into a farmer's wagon, which stood before the tavern.</p> 
               <p>Tom was driven five miles into the country, and was set down in a farm-yard, abounding with fowls and cattle.</p> 
               <p>"This is our home," said his new friend.</p> 
               <p>Tom thought it a queer place for him to get "as much as he could drink," but did not venture a remark. The gentleman led the way to a handsome stone house, gave Tom a seat in the porch, and ordered a boy to bring a pail of water. It was cool and limpid.</p> 
               <p>"Help yourself," said the gentleman. "It is good, and you will stay with me a good while before you drink the spring dry."</p> 
               <p>Tom thought his friend very facetious. He<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6124-00000064"/> chuckled a little, and ventured to say, "but, the licker?"</p> 
               <p>"What licker?" returned the gentleman, as if he was astonished. "There is none about my premises."</p> 
               <p>"But you told me if I went with you I should have all I could drink."</p> 
               <p>"So you shall-the spring never gets dry, and the dairy is large."</p> 
               <p>"I'm not used to it."</p> 
               <p>"I know that <emph>well,</emph>" returned the farmer, "but I mean you shall be. Come, we'll not dispute now; supper is ready."</p> 
               <p>Tom was not unwilling to eat a good supper, and, as night was coming on, and he wanted a place to lay his head, he didn't dare to scold about the trick that had been played upon him.</p> 
               <p>When he was ready to go to bed, the gentleman conducted him to a neat room, and, bidding him good night, locked the door. In the morning Tom found himself a prisoner.</p> 
               <p>"This <emph>is</emph> a man-trap, sure," he cried, furiously, and kicked against the door.</p> 
               <p>"What is all this noise?" said a voice on the outside.</p> 
               <p>"I want to come out," cried Tom.</p> 
                
               <p>"You are my prisoner," said the farmer, for it was he who had answered Tom's summons. "I can keep you here as long as I please, but if you will promise not to go off of the farm for three months, you shall be well fed and cared for. I only want your word for security."</p> 
               <p>"I'll do it," cried Tom, eagerly, arguing to himself, that if only his word was taken, the bonds that held him would not be very powerful, although at the same time he felt a degree of pride to think the farmer manifested so much confidence in his integrity. He naturally thought the whole affair a queer one.</p> 
               <p>In a day or two, Tom saw that the farmer's only object was to do him a good service, by taking from him his love for gin. The good nature, to which appeals had been made by the farmer, would not allow him to be ungrateful, and for six months Tom worked on the farm a sober man. Then the farmer trusted him to go to the nearest town. He came back at the appointed time, sober. He had learned to work, and was useful.</p> 
               <p>At the end of twelve months from the night of his imprisonment the farmer said to him-</p> 
               <p>"I am going to take a ride to day, Thomas. You will go with me."</p> 
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6124-00000065"/> 
               <p>At the town where the farmer first met Tom he conducted him to a shop, and had him "rigged out" in a handsome suit of clothes, and then paid him in addition, fair wages for all the work he had performed. Tom's amazement at this proceeding we would not attempt to describe, but it did not abate in the least when the farmer said-</p> 
               <p>"Now you will go with me to the town where you were known as a sot. I shall call you Mr. Brown."</p> 
               <p>"Why, sir?" ventured Tom, his eyes full of tears.</p> 
               <p>"You will see, when we get there, but you must be a stranger to everybody," returned the farmer.</p> 
               <p>"Anything you say, sir," replied Tom, more deeply amazed than he had yet been.</p> 
               <p>Arrived at the village, Mr. Brown was introduced to the principal citizens. The farmer was generally known, and much respected. Mr. Brown was well dressed, and made a fine appearance. He was invited with the farmer to dine with the magistrate, a man before whom he had often been arraigned as a drunken vagrant. Had he been suddenly transported to the Moon, to Venus, or to Mars, he had not been more decidedly astonished. He knew nearly everybody-why did nobody know him? Because Mr. Brown was no more like Tom Toperly, than a well-dressed, temperate man is, anywhere, like a ragged, bloated, street drunkard.</p> 
               <p>At dinner, looking at the magistrate, said the farmer-</p> 
               <p>"I believe it is about a year since a poor drunken wretch, well-named Tom Toperly, disappeared from the village. Has there ever been any tidings of him?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a word," said the magistrate. "It is strange; Tom was a good fellow, but he would do nothing but drink gin; when he could he begged it, and he would never work only to get money to buy it."</p> 
               <p>During this speech Mr. Brown's face passed through a multitude of singular expressions. The farmer, watching him, replied to the magistrate-</p> 
               <p>"He was at my house after he left here, as fond of drink as ever."</p> 
               <p>"I'll warrant it," returned the magistrate. "I've no doubt he died like a beast in some ditch."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Brown could endure it no longer; jumping up, and, to the consternation of the magistrate, nearly throwing the table over, he cried-</p> 
               <p>"No, he didn't! Here he is! I'm Tom Toperly! Don't 'Mr. Brown' me any more. You<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6124-00000066"/> kicked and cuffed me about in this town, and was goin' to send me to the work-house, and called me nothin' but 'drunken Tom;' but this farmer made me think I was something of a man; and now I ain't ragged, and dirty, and bloated, but I've got good clothes to wear, and money in my pocket, and know how to earn more, and you have taken me for a gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"Glad of it, Tom-glad of it, Tom! We're having temperance meetings, and you shall give us a speech-tell'em your story, Tom. You <emph>are</emph> a gentleman, and you shall stay in my house as long as you're in town," exclaimed the magistrate, shaking him by the hand till his shoulder ached.</p> 
               <p>"Make a man think he is somebody, if you have to lock him up to do it; that's the way to reform him, say I," cried Tom. "The farmer's confidence in my simple word, that nobody would trust, made a man of me."</p> 
               <p>Tom told his story to all his old "chums," got a number of them to follow his example, went back home with the farmer, in due course of time became his son-in-law, and died leaving a number of children, who, though they inherited the unpromising name of Toperly, have ever been soberly.</p>

               <p>NEXT to a baby in a household, as a bond of union to the world, a peace dispenser, and an instrument of social elevation, is music-not music which is learned for the sake of fashion, not thrumming the keys of a piano because our neighbor's girls thrum, but music, which is a companion for the soul-which is in sympathy with its joys and griefs-through which it may breathe its sadness or its happiness.</p> 
               <p>Music had better be patronized because it is the fashion, than not be patronized at all, but its true blessings are never known except when it is encouraged from an unselfish love. An instrument of music well played upon, sweet voices in harmony blending, have no superiors as promoters of social harmony in a household. The family in which music is encouraged from the love of music will seldom be disturbed by social discord-there will be no internal strife or bickering.</p> 
               <p>What a strengthening, soothing agent may be the simple violin in a poor man's family. See him<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6124-00000067"/> when he comes home, weary with a day's toil, and his children greet him at the door. Supper is not quite ready. The "gude wife" knows he is hungry and tired. She takes his violin from its nail on the wall, and while she busies herself preparing the evening meal, he plays some lively, inspiring tune. Her steps are quicker than they would be without music; her task is light and pleasant; he forgets the toil of the day; the music is rest and food to him; the children delighted, look up fondly from the floor to their father's beaming face. Happiness reigns in the household, and the supper has a zest, which no man knows who has not toiled through a long day and enjoyed a sweet home and sweet music at night.</p> 
               <p>He who makes music for the million is a benefactor. He who invents a musical instrument, combining excellence and cheapness, is a philanthropist-a missionary of peace and morals-of household joy and household goodness;-household goodness secured, and the nation is virtuous.</p> 
               <p>He who has no songs-no sweet airs kindly played in his household, is a martyr to many trials which would be light as gossamer with music's spell to "drive dull care away," but which are now like heavy chains and binding fetters.</p>

               <head>MATRIMONY FOR MONEY.</head> 
               <p>AMONG the pleasant recollections of my youth are those of a benevolent, middle-aged lady, who was in possession of a handsome property, advantageously situated in one of the prettiest towns in the interior of Pennsylvania. She was a neat, trim widow, who prided herself in appearing at least ten years younger than the "family record" of an ancient bible, that lay upon the sewing-table of her private room, showed her to be.</p> 
               <p>Her ambition was to "catch" a spruce husband, not over thirty-five years of age, who had a fortune sufficient to advance her position in the <emph>aristocratic</emph> world. She had "set her cap" for a number of wealthy bachelors, who had paid her slight attentions; but, for some reason to her unexplainable, she could never so happily "entrap" any one that he appeared to have serious intentions against her widowhood.</p> 
               <p>It began to be whispered in certain select circles<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6124-00000068"/> that Mrs. Andress was <emph>anxious</emph> to show that great disrespect for the memory of a deceased husband, which is implied in the taking of another. Something of the feeling occasioned by this view of the indelicacy of her course, may have sprung from the fact that there was a number of "<emph>matronly</emph>" maiden ladies in the village, who often had pious impressions that for several of the gentlemen who had paid slight attentions to Mrs. Andress, they were much more fitting companions than the "conceited widow."</p> 
               <p>This feeling was measurably increased when, one bright summer afternoon, Mrs. Andress was seen riding through the village in a dashing equipage, known to belong to a gentleman of reputed great wealth, who had only the day previous arrived in town, and taken rooms at the "Stage House," the first-class hotel. This gentleman, the handsome Mr. Harcourt, as his carriage rolled swiftly along the principal street, was observed to be in very confidential conversation with his precious charge. That afternoon and evening there were numerous "calls" made by a class of disappointed ladies, and the astonishing discovery of the day was freely commented upon.</p> 
                
               <p>"It will be a match," said Miss A--, at one of the houses she visited.</p> 
               <p>"No it won't," testily retorted Miss C--, a maiden whose temper had been soured by disappointment, and who spoke sharply in sharp tones; "no it won't-he'll find <emph>it</emph> out; he ain't going to marry that widow unless he knows why."</p> 
               <p>"But if he don't find <emph>it</emph> out-then won't there be a dreadful time!" returned Miss A--, adding "but perhaps it is all for love."</p> 
               <p>"For love!-I dare say for love!-love for that old widow, when there are so many handsome young maidens in town that would be glad to get Mr. Harcourt-I tell you it ain't so," replied Miss C--.</p> 
               <p>"Well, we shall see," said Miss A--, as she took her leave.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, we <emph>shall</emph> see; but it is too bad," answered the other lady.</p> 
               <p>Now, what Mr. Harcourt was to "find out," he could not possibly have surmised, had he overheard this conversation.</p> 
               <p>Not an hour after the meeting of Miss A-- and Miss C--, Mr. Harcourt welcomed an intimate friend at his room in the hotel. A bottle of<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6124-00000069"/> wine was ordered, and a box of "choice regalias" produced.</p> 
               <p>"You had a pleasant ride, Harcourt," said Parker, deliberately sipping his wine.</p> 
               <p>"A capital one," answered Harcourt, knocking the ashes from his cigar.</p> 
               <p>"Will the scheme work?"</p> 
               <p>"I believe it will. The widow is struck with my dashing manners. She admired my carriage and ponies, and appeared particularly delighted with my <emph>brilliant</emph> conversation-brilliant-yes-don't you laugh, Parker, that's what she was <emph>pleased</emph> to term it."</p> 
               <p>"And how do you like the widow?"</p> 
               <p>"Tolerably, Parker-tolerably. I am afraid she is rather older than I supposed; but it is my very last chance-the die is cast. She will make a passable-an <emph>endurable</emph> wife; and money I must have. My debts of 'honor' <emph>shall</emph> be cancelled, Parker."</p> 
               <p>"How long a time do you give yourself for the accomplishment of this financiering scheme?"</p> 
               <p>"Matrimonial scheme, you mean, Parker; but no matter about the money. If all works well, I'll propose in a week, and be married in a month."</p> 
                
               <p>"Have you any thing on hand to-night, Harcourt?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a thing, Parker."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose we discuss the scheme over a game of cards."</p> 
               <p>"Agreed."</p> 
               <p>Cards were produced; and flushed with wine, the <emph>rich</emph> Mr. Harcourt and the <emph>genteel</emph> Mr. Parker were soon intent on "debts of honor." We leave them while Harcourt is, for once, "in luck."</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>A fortnight elapsed. Harcourt had been incessant in his attentions to the widow, and all had gone "merry as a marriage bell," save certain unpleasant stories, supposed to have been circulated by certain jealous maidens. These stories, however, had been pretty nearly hushed up by the perseverance of Harcourt's friend Parker; and widow Andress was indignant that any body should tell such insulting falsehoods about her husband that was to be.</p> 
               <p>The widow sat one evening in waiting for the appearance of the "<emph>dear</emph>" Mr. Harcourt," when a confidential friend made her a call.</p> 
               <p>"It is whispered," said Mrs. B--, "that you are to be married, Mrs. Andress."</p> 
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6124-00000070"/> 
               <p>"I would not have <emph>any</emph> body know it for the world-but I'll tell you, Mrs. B--, that which is whispered is true. We have now been engaged nearly a week. I expect Mr. Harcourt will call this evening, when the day will be set."</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure he will make you a good husband, Mrs. Andress?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I am, or I would not be so foolish as to marry again; besides, he is rich-<emph>so</emph> rich."</p> 
               <p>"Some people express doubts on that subject, Mrs. Andress."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, <emph>some</emph> people do, because they envy my good fortune-<emph>some</emph> people, who flatter themselves that they are younger and handsomer than I am; but every body knows that they are not as charming. Mr. Harcourt loves me for myself; he has often said so; and he must be rich, Mrs. B. No man can own such a handsome carriage and such fine horses, and dress so well, who is not rich-very rich, Mrs. B--."</p> 
               <p>"I hope you will not be disappointed, Mrs. Andress; Mr. Harcourt certainly <emph>appears</emph> like a very fine man."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. B--; I shall send you an early invitation to our wedding."</p> 
               <p>When Mr. Harcourt called on the "<emph>charming</emph>" widow, it was arranged that the wedding should take place on Thursday of the following week.-Harcourt, on reporting this arrangement to his friend Parker, remarked-</p> 
               <p>"The widow wishes to make a grand display; and you know I must not look shabby on the great day; so I had it put off as long as possible. By the way, Parker, I learned for the first time to-night, that Dr. S-- really loves the widow; but he is poor, and she will not have him. I am afraid, with all her possessions, that she is a <emph>little</emph> avaricious; but never mind-she'll soon have less to be avaricious about."</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>I need not give a particular description of the wedding. Stories generally conclude with the <emph>union</emph> of lovers; but mine has a chapter beyond the wedding. The widow looked fine as a bride. She was dressed with taste, and made an impression which annoyed Miss A-- and Miss C-- very much, who, perhaps, for reasons not to be mentioned, had been invited with all becoming ceremony. When the bride was receiving congratulations, Miss A-- whispered to her friends,</p> 
               <p>"Well, it <emph>is</emph> done, and it <emph>is</emph> too bad. That man<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6124-00000071"/> must be crazy-how handsome he does look. He'll find it out."</p> 
               <p>"Too bad!" broke out Miss C--, "indeed it is: but I begin to believe we must have been deceived. He must be rich, and he does love the widow. See how graciously he attends upon her. They are coming this way."</p> 
               <p>Miss A-- had only time to whisper-"If we have been deceived, I hope they'll leave town; but rich or not rich, what a silly man he was! I should not really have objected to him as a husband, myself, as particular as I am."</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>A week of pleasure passed-a week occupied busily in receiving calls and attending parties; for "widow Andress" had always a large circle of acquaintances, and they were mostly fashionable people.</p> 
               <p>One morning Mr. Harcourt went out early. He did not return till Mrs. Harcourt had taken breakfast. She met him with an anxious countenance, and said-</p> 
               <p>"My dear, what has detained you?"</p> 
               <p>"Business of importance," he replied pleasantly.</p> 
               <p>"Why, what business can <emph>you</emph> have, Mr. Harcourt, that should detain you!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Let us walk into the parlor," answered the husband.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Harcourt followed her husband with a beating heart. She feared that something dreadful had happened; and yet she thought that could not be, for Mr. Harcourt appeared very pleasant.</p> 
               <p>When they were seated on the sofa in the parlor, Mr. Harcourt took his wife's hand, and said, in his blandest manner-</p> 
               <p>"My dear, I have been in trouble this morning. The landlord at the hotel where I stopped presented me a bill of several hundred dollars, which I am unable to meet, because I have been disappointed in the receipt of some funds which I ordered my bankers to forward me."</p> 
               <p>"But, Mr. T-will oblige you by waiting a few days."</p> 
               <p>"No, my dear, his necessities require that he should have it to-day."</p> 
               <p>"What is the sum, Mr. Harcourt?" said she, not the least concerned, apparently. Her indifference was exceedingly pleasant to Mr. Harcourt, and he replied, with a smile-</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Only</emph> five hundred dollars."</p> 
               <p>"Is that all! Why you need not disappoint Mr. T--. Any of your friends, to whom you<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6124-00000072"/> have been introduced, will gladly lend you that sum till you hear from your bankers."</p> 
               <p>"But, my dear," interposed Mr. Harcourt, in a tone which evinced a little astonishment, "would it not be much better for you to let me have the sum? I have a delicacy about borrowed money."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Harcourt," cried the lady, "why, do you not know that I have two children-a son and a daughter, of age?"</p> 
               <p>"Of age, Mrs. Harcourt!" exclaimed Mr. Harcourt, in his turn astonished (for he knew the widow had children, but had never seen them, and supposed they were young), but, with as good a grace as possible, he continued, "And what of that, my dear? I should be pleased to see them here; I am sure this house is large enough for us all."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mr. Harcourt, have you never learned," cried the lady, as if much surprised, "this house belonged to the children, by their father's will, on the day I married a second time?"</p> 
               <p>"The money in bank, Mrs. Harcourt," exclaimed the gentleman, beginning to tremble.</p> 
               <p>"It is theirs' too," answered Mrs. Harcourt.</p> 
               <p>"And the property in the country we visited last week?"</p> 
                
               <p>"All theirs, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"And you have nothing!"</p> 
               <p>"Only you, my dear husband, and, with your fortune, I shall be satisfied."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> fortune, madam," exclaimed Harcourt, striding across the room, while the blood rushed to his face-"<emph>my</emph> fortune, madam-it is a sorry one."</p> 
               <p>"That beautiful carriage and those fine horses-your property on the Susquehannah-your house in the city of Harrisburg-do you call that a sorry fortune? Mr. Harcourt, do not be agitated. You did not marry me for money-"</p> 
               <p>"You deceived yourself, madam, and you have deceived me!" cried Harcourt, losing his self-possession. "I thought you rich-you are poor; you thought me rich-I am worse than poor-I am in debt nearly a thousand dollars in this town; and if I don't get the money to-day, I shall be in jail to-morrow, unless I get out of town."</p> 
               <p>"The horses and carriage! Mr. Harcourt," sobbed the widow-</p> 
               <p>"They belong to the keeper of a livery stable in Harrisburg. I want money to pay for their use and keeping. This is the romance of marrying!"</p> 
               <p>
                  <emph>It</emph> was out on both sides-<emph>it</emph> was a double take-in</p> 
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6124-00000073"/> 
               <p>"You are a wretch, sir," sobbed the wife, in desperation; "you married me for money-you have robbed me of a fortune."</p> 
               <p>"And you married me for <emph>love,</emph> I presume," retorted Harcourt. "I must flee. We met under mutual deception; we part, understanding each other. You will hear more of me."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Harcourt screamed and fainted. Her maid found her in a fit of hysterics. Mr. Harcourt was gone. Neither he nor his friend Parker was ever seen again in that town. Mrs. Harcourt learned, to her undisguised chagrin, that all her husband said about himself was true, and not only this, but that he was a "sporting gentleman," who, having heard of her desire to marry a rich man, had left the city of Harrisburg <emph>equipped</emph> for the conquest of her <emph>heart</emph> and fortune. He had made a bad speculation of it, in not knowing the tenure by which the widow held her fortune.</p> 
               <p>The first time Miss A-- met Miss C--, the widow's disaster was of course the subject of their conversation.</p> 
               <p>"He always looked to me like a scape-grace; I never could fancy him; I never believed that equipage was his," said Miss A--.</p> 
               <p>"If I remember, you thought him a very proper man, and would have liked him for a husband," answered Miss C--.</p> 
               <p>"Not I, Miss," retorted Miss A--; "it was you that was jealous of the widow; I never did like the dreadful fellow."</p> 
               <p>"Jealous! Miss A--," cried Miss C--, "I am astonished at your perversion of the truth; I always said he was a villain."</p> 
               <p>We leave the reader to decide which of these ladies knew Mr. Harcourt to be a villain. Their "foresight" was always matter of dispute between the maidens. Such we believe they lived and died.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Harcourt did not long retain the youthful appearance on which she had many years prided herself. Her trouble was grievous-crows'-feet were soon tracked in the corners of her eyes, and wrinkles were in a few months furrowed on her pale forehead. She considered it a great insult to be called Mrs. Harcourt.</p>

               <p>ALONG the pavement flies a shadow thrown by the moonlight; it follows a man whose eager steps have led him far in advance of a throng that has just emerged from a public hall. Swifter becomes his pace, and louder sound his heel-strokes on the hard pavement, till suddenly he turns, and springs up a flight of steps. He applies his night-key to a lock. It will not work. He becomes impatient, nervously jerks the bell-wire, and that moment a servant opens the door. He speeds to the sitting-room, where his wife awaits him, and, without stopping to take breath, exclaims-</p> 
               <p>"O-Anna-if you had been at the concert-we've got it-O, but it's a handsome one-rosewood carved-splendid tone-it will be here in the morning!"</p> 
               <p>Then the poor fellow was obliged to take a breathing spell, and his wife had an opportunity to express her joy at their good fortune. Her husband's ticket had drawn a very handsome piano at a prize concert. Before ten o'clock on the following morning the instrument was deposited at the door of their house, and soon had a place in one corner of their neat little parlor.</p> 
               <p>Henry Heber was a lively, trustworthy young man, who had a situation, at a salary of one thousand dollars per annum, in a wholesale store. He lived in a small, but comfortable house in the western part of the city, which he had built with money his wife brought him. This wife was a prudent woman, for one who had not a little fashionable ambition; and with but one child, a promising blue-eyed boy, who had just began to prattle, they were getting on swimmingly in the world. Anna was delighted beyond telling with the prize piano; and it really was a splendid instrument, in style not at all in keeping with the furniture of their parlor. After she had thrummed on the keys a few minutes, she looked up archly, and said to her husband-</p> 
               <p>"You know I am but an indifferent player, Harry, and if I am to discourse music for you, I must have some new music books and a teacher."</p> 
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6124-00000075"/> 
               <p>"Certainly, you must have a teacher, and I'll look out for one to-day. Who would you recommend, Mrs. Brown?" asked the indulgent husband, turning to a lady who had called on them to see and hear the prize, she had hoped to get.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I hardly know," returned the lady; "there are a number of excellent teachers in the city, but I think the gentleman recently from Paris, Mr. P--, the best. His terms are high, but my girls go to him, and they make great proficiency."</p> 
               <p>"He played on this piano at the concert, and I liked him. I must go to the store now, but, before I come home to tea, I'll see him." And, with these words, Henry hastened to his business.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Heber had many visitors during the day, and all were delighted with the piano, but a number of them thought it would show to better advantage, if the parlor were furnished in the late style. When the husband came home in the evening, he brought to his wife the "glad tidings" that Mr. P-- had been engaged, and would give her the first lesson on the following Monday.</p> 
               <p>In the evening, while a young lady who was visiting them sat at the piano, Anna was thinking of the remarks her guest had made about new furniture niture, and it did not seem to her that their carpet was just such a figure as so splendid a piano should sit upon. Henry, perhaps, was having a similar train of thought, for, glancing around the parlor, he remarked-</p> 
               <p>"That piano rather puts a blush on the other furniture."</p> 
               <p>"So it does," returned Anna; "and I've been thinking that we ought at least to have a new carpet, and I would like to have it before I commence my lessons."</p> 
               <p>"We'll think about it," answered the husband, rather indifferently.</p> 
               <p>But on the morrow Anna was invited to walk up town, and a handsome and costly carpet was purchased. Mrs. Brown, over the way, saw the upholsterer leave it, and when he took his leave she hurried across to Mrs. Heber's. She admired it very much. "It was so handsome it made the old-fashioned centre-table look wretched." Anna immediately saw the force of this remark, and Henry was not long in finding it out. A new centre-table was forthwith selected to grace the parlor, and as the husband followed the carman who conveyed it to his house, he called into a book store, and several splendidly bound volumes were<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6124-00000076"/> purchased to lay upon it, and the next evening a solar lamp of the newest pattern threw from the new table a mellow light over the new carpet.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Smith called the next day to see Anna. Her circle of acquaintance was large, and of course there were Smiths as well as Browns within it. The lady was seated on one of the rather old-fashioned chairs, and she soon became fidgety.</p> 
               <p>"You have got a beautiful piano, Mrs. Heber, a beautiful carpet, and a beautiful centre-table, but you will excuse me if I say these chairs are horrible."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Smith was a plain spoken woman-as the Smiths generally are-and Anna excused her. When the lady had bowed herself out of the door, urging that Anna owed her several calls, Mrs. Heber took a "calm survey" of her little parlor, and was obliged to acknowledge that Mrs. Smith had judged correctly; the style of the chairs was too heavy for that of the piano and table. They were promptly removed, and a set of costly workmanship took their place. A rich plush sofa followed the chairs, then mantel ornaments, then new window curtains, and so on till the parlor was furnished throughout in the latest fashion.</p> 
               <p>One evening when Mr. and Mrs. Heber were at tea, Anna remarked that "Mrs. Brown thought they ought to give their young friends a party. They had been out a good deal, and they had never given one. Their parlor was now furnished in the fashion, and they could give a party as well as not.</p> 
               <p>Of course, in due time the party was given, and it was gotten up in excellent taste. Every body admired the parlor, every body was delighted with the party, and Mr. and Mrs. Heber made many new and fashionable friends.</p> 
               <p>When the guests had retired, Anna and Henry sat together on the sofa. They seemed well pleased with the conduct of their guests. Anna looked up to her husband with affectionate pride, saying.</p> 
               <p>"Every one admired our furniture, and all were pleased with our party. This is a nice place, Harry. We have not been extravagant, but we have a comfortable home."</p> 
               <p>"True, and a pleasant one," returned the husband, perhaps, a little soberly. "The two hundred dollars we had in the bank is now in furniture, and we have made some debts, but our home is so much more inviting, and we have so many more friends, I am not sorry."</p> 
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6124-00000077"/> 
               <p>"Besides, Harry, we've got along so well; folks expect something of us, and it is well to make a little display. When you get into business, as you hope, you'll do the better for it."</p> 
               <p>"I agree with you, Anna; and, by-the-by, I may as well tell you now, Mr. T., my employer, told me to-day that Mr. S., the husband of the woman who did not like our chairs, would be obliged to give up his store, on account of not being able to meet notes which T. holds, and he said that if I could make an arrangement with Mr. S., I might take the business and have time to pay the notes. The business is profitable, and I should do well."</p> 
               <p>In less than two weeks Henry Heber was installed proprietor of a store. The establishment was forthwith handsomely fitted up; and he commenced business with a glowing prospect. Before he got fairly started, he felt sorely the need of his two hundred dollars which were buried in his parlor, but his credit was good, and he exercised it.</p> 
               <p>He had a fair run of custom, and his profits were considerable. His fashionable friends thought him to be doing well, and he mingled in their company like a lord. Concerts, soirees, and balls, besides private parties, social and <foreign xml:lang="ITA">musicale,</foreign> were frequent. Anna's position required her to attend all of the "best class," and heavy expenses were incurred; but Henry was enjoying himself like a prince, till, within a few weeks of the time when his notes became due. Business grew slack, and clouds began to gather in the future. The pressure continued. His business did not afford him the means to meet his payments. He was ruined if they were not met; and he had but one alternative: let his friends know how matters stood, or sell his furniture at auction.</p> 
               <p>The sale was made, at a sacrifice to be sure, but his credit was saved. Their house was leased, and Anna and Henry took rooms at a first-class hotel; this their "position" required. Their fashionable friends understood that these changes had been made because Mrs. Heber contemplated spending the summer at a fashionable watering place. Six months passed. Henry Heber and his wife had learned what "fashionable" life was, and without an entire revulsion of their habits they could not economize. They kept up appearances, but everyday his business embarrassments pressed harder, till at length he must get help from his fashionable friends, or make an assignment.</p> 
               <p>He applied to numerous intimate acquaintances,<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6124-00000078"/> but found that, though they admired his style of living, and relished the dinners he had given-thought him a good fellow at concerts and soirees-if they were to be believed, their embarrassments were equal to his; and none could help him to a dollar. He realized the "popular creed," <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"If a man is down, give him a thrust;</l>

               </p> 
               <p>The assignment came, and Henry Heber fell, in mercantile phrase, from a merchant to a clerk. In this last act he lost many acquaintances, but no friends.</p> 
               <p>Their house did not go in the wreck, because it was Anna's property, and they could now occupy it. It is furnished in plain style, with one exception-the prize piano. It is a treasure for many reasons. The lessons its history teaches are profitable, and its music is profitable, for Anna gives instruction upon it to a number of pupils, for the purpose of assisting her husband to make another "start in the world."</p> 
               <p>Not long since Henry met a friend who accosted him with-</p> 
               <p>"Going to the prize concert?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Not I."</p> 
               <p>"You might draw the piano."</p> 
               <p>"I have been fortunate that way once, and that will answer. Come up to my house to-morrow evening, if you draw the prize, and I will give you the history of my piano. It might be a good lesson."</p> 
               <p>The friend was not the lucky ticket-holder, but his curiosity being awakened, he called on Henry, and learned the story which you have been told, dear reader. Consider whether it has not a practical lesson.</p>

               <head>JARED PARKER.</head> 
               <p>ON one of the most fertile glades of the Scioto valley there settled, some twenty years ago, two wealthy families, from interior Pennsylvania. The hope of these families and the pride of the neighborhood, were two boys, verging upon manhood, who were first at log-rollings, cabin-raisings, and corn-huskings, as well as foremost in all the rustic sports by which holiday afternoons and moonlight evenings were beguiled.</p> 
               <p>In all games and labors these youths were competitors, but Jared Parker, by one year the elder of Herbert Williams, was commonly the victor. He was not more athletic-but he was less passionate, more self-possessed, and less impetuous. Jared was of a pleasant, genial nature, and bore his honors meekly. Herbert was vexed, to the heart's core, when vanquished, and bitter feelings were stirred when his companions laughed merrily with Jared, or complimented him upon his agility and dexterity. Jared knew no rivalship, but Herbert dwelt on one, which with evil thoughts, he determined, should eventually be decided in his favor.</p> 
               <p>The "Rose of the Valley" was Anne Belvey, a true country beauty, who, with artless grace of manner, speaking beauty of face and symmetry of person, and ardent affections, which gushed for all nature, had won the hearts of the acquaintances who met her at the green-sward dance or at the winter-party. Jared loved Anne, so did Herbert; Anne loved, but it was with that love which has never settled its own preferences, and wells up whenever admiration is excited or sympathy enlisted.-</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The silver moonlight fell upon the opening blossoms of choice fruit-trees, and a gentle May wind wafted orchard perfumes which came with a glad welcome to a maiden, who had seen the bloom of but eighteen spring-times; she leaned against a rustic seat which stood where the select fruit-blossoms dropped. She was picking slowly to pieces a wild flower that had grown at her feet.</p> 
               <p>"I want you to be a friend, Herbert-I like you when you are kind, but I do not love you, as you<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6124-00000080"/> ask, because I know you are cruel and wicked sometimes," said Anne Belvey, when Herbert Williams had poured a tale of tender love into her ears, with that bright moonlight shining about them-the spring blossoms falling and the perfumes wafting.</p> 
               <p>"They have told you tales, Anne."</p> 
               <p>"Who, Herbert?"</p> 
               <p>"Jared and his friends."</p> 
               <p>"You wrong him, Herbert; Jared always speaks well of you. I told him you were cruel, and would be revengeful, but he said I did not understand you. You know, Herbert, when I wanted you yesterday to put up the bird's nest which fell from the apple-tree, you tore it to pieces and threw it over the fence; I did not like that. Jared would not have acted so."</p> 
               <p>These were bitter words to the dark spirit of Herbert Williams, but he bit his lips sternly and struggled with his rising anger, till the veins on his neck corrugated. He had love and rivalry to assist in self-control.</p> 
               <p>"But I was in sport, Anne, when I tore up the bird's nest; besides, it was an old one."</p> 
               <p>"No, Herbert, it had for two years been the house of robbins. I watched over them with much pleasure, and it pained me to see you so heartlessly destroy their home. It was to them, as if some stronger power should tear down your home, and leave your little sisters without shelter. But this is not all, Herbert-if it were, I might forgive you; I know we can never be lovers-we would not be happy as such, but let us always be friends."</p> 
               <p>Anne gave Herbert her hand as freely as if he had never grieved her. The lover took it with a nervous grasp, which had it expressed the feelings of the young man's heart, would have wrung the slender arm from the fair shoulder.</p> 
               <p>A voice reached the young couple, and Anne said, "Mother calls me-good night, Herbert-remember, we will <emph>always</emph> be friends." And the open-hearted girl bounded to answer her mother's summons.</p> 
               <p>There was a heavy frown upon Herbert Williams' brow-his teeth were set-his fists were clenched-his step was heavy as he strode homeward.</p> 
               <p>"I'll be revenged," was sternly muttered.</p> 
               <p>When Anne Belvey was alone in her little chamber, Herbert's conversation was vivid in her mind, and her calm judgment commended the<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6124-00000081"/> truths she had told him-then there came contrasts;-actions, characters and thoughts were reviewed,-Jared Parker was not an indifferent actor in the little heart-drame, performed in the waking and sleeping dreams of the free thinking and generous hearted girl that night.</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The spring blossoms had fallen, the perfumes of opening buds and flowers had died away-the fruits had grown, and now the fragrance of ripening orchard-products was gladdening the heart of the farmer.</p> 
               <p>Anne Belvey had the same seat at which we saw her with Herbert Williams.</p> 
               <p>"Herbert is wicked," said she, "he looks darkly at me, and frowns when he meets you; I sometimes fear him, Jared; but it shall not interfere with my love for you."</p> 
               <p>"Herbert is not to be feared, love. He would not harm you, nor me; perhaps, had I lost you, I should have frowned and looked darkly as he does, but you should not now let these thoughts come across your mind. To-morrow will show him how futile future love will be, and he will be reconciled and be a warm friend again."</p> 
                
               <p>"May it be so, Jared, but I fear you do not know Herbert, I only dread that he will be revenged on you. He is revengeful."</p> 
               <p>"I have no fears, Anne, and you ought not to have; but come, we will walk into the house, and with your father and mother talk over the plans of the morrow, when you will be mine."</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>A year elapsed-to Anne and Jared Parker was born a son,-content and happiness dwelt in their household,-their plain cabin was one of the "general homes" of the neighborhood; and its merry-makings were the pleasantest which the young folks attended.</p> 
               <p>There was one, who had no pleasure in this enjoyment; but whenever he observed it, or it was spoken of in his presence, feelings were aroused which make men 'fit for stratagems and spoils.'"</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>'Twas a winter night; piercing winds made blazing fires comfortable, the dry snow crisped beneath the farmer's tread-a lurid flame rose in the air, and as it gleamed over the earth's winter covering, dispelled the darkness for miles around the mansion of the Williams family. Their large, well stored barn was in flames; every possible exertion<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6124-00000082"/> was made to save it, but without success. It was destroyed, and with it a number of fine cattle and superior horses, with farming utensils, and grains and fruits, to the value of several thousand dollars.</p> 
               <p>It was the work of an incendiary, without doubt. Who could be the villain!-was a question anxiously discussed.</p> 
               <p>Various suspicions were started, and at length a rumor became current, that Jared Parker was suspected. He was arrested, examined, and, strange to declare, almost without testimony, to justify suspicion, was held for trial.</p> 
               <p>The strifes which had existed between Jared, the accused, and Herbert, <emph>now</emph> the injured, were speculated upon, facts were distorted, actions misrepresented, and many, who had oft-times spoken highly of Jared's quiet, mild nature, now talked of it as a mask for wicked passions, and long-nursed revenge-for what?-few had a definite idea, but he was under suspicion of crime, and with some persons this is always equivalent to actual proof of guilt.</p> 
               <p>Anne had fearful forebodings. Jared bid her not to fear, protesting his innocence-in which she had every confidence-yet she feared the result of machinations which might be invented against him. Jared had no suspicion of what testimony could be produced, and made no preparation for his trial, confident that he would be acquitted.</p> 
               <p>On the day of the trial the Court House was crowded with the friends of the accused and the accuser. A distorted history of Jared and Herbert's competitions were presented to the jury; then a woman named Brown, who had many times been hospitably entertained at Jared's home, was put upon the witness' stand. She testified, that on the night of the conflagration Jared Parker came to a house, where she was visiting with a Mrs. Jacobs, asked for some fire, obtained it, and went down the lane towards the Williams' farm. Mrs. Jacobs said there was something wrong, he must be watched. They followed him, and saw him enter the barn-in a few moments the roof was a sheet of flame.</p> 
               <p>Jared had been away from home that night-he could not prove an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alibi</foreign>-the witness was cross-questioned, but in all particulars appeared consistent, and Jared Parker was found guilty of <emph>arson,</emph> and sentenced to the Penitentiary for <emph>eight years.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Mrs. Jacobs had removed from the neighborhood<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6124-00000083"/> hood, during the time intervening between the commission of the crime and the trial. Every possible exertion was made by Jared's friends to ascertain her whereabouts, but without success, and he was committed to a gloomy cell in the State Prison.</p> 
               <p>Anne Parker, with a woman's determination, where her exertion is called for in the rescue of a loved one, resolved that Mrs. Jacobs should be found. Immediately she set about the search-gradually her means were exhausted-then she was a pensioner on the bounties of her relatives. Every phantom of a rumor, which gave suspicion of the woman's residence, was pursued by Anne, in confidence that by this she should prove her husband's innocence, until further search seemed vain, and it became the settled conclusion that Mrs. Jacobs could no longer be among the living.</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Four years elapsed-Jared Parker had yet four to atone for the crime for which he stood condemned. Still he protested his innocence-still he declared it would one day be proclaimed.</p> 
               <p>He was a favorite with the officers of the prison. His good conduct had secured him many favors, and at length reached the ears of the Governor of the State. He visited the prison, heard Jared's story, and resolved to institute search for the Mrs. Jacobs described. He knew nothing of the exertions Anne Parker had made, because he had not told Jared his intentions.</p> 
               <p>A lawyer was employed to conduct the search for the woman on whom the evidence rested. He was on a visit to Cincinnati, and inserted an advertisement in the papers, that, by calling at a certain office, "this woman would learn something greatly to her advantage."</p> 
               <p>The advertisement was answered by an elderly lady, who gave her name as Mrs. Jacobs, and stated that she remembered the burning of the barn, but that she had never heard of Parker's trial. She had known the woman who testified against him, but had never taken the part described in the circumstances which secured his conviction, and believed that he must have been the victim of a conspiracy. To this effect she made deposition-immediately the facts were laid before the Governor, and Jared Parker was pardoned.</p> 
               <p>Four years he had been a prisoner, under the ban of felon proscription-four years his family had been without its natural protector-his home<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6124-00000084"/> had gone into the hands of a stranger-his father had been gathered with the dead, and his mother, tottering on the verge of the tomb, mourned her eldest son as one whom she soon expected to meet beyond the grave. Anne's health had been impaired by her travels, and the consequent exposures and privations, and she was but a wreck of the woman he had left in charge of his household, when the officers of justice dragged him from it; his youthful energies were wasted-he was dis-spirited, and broken in constitution. But he had not suffered as deeply, in those mental agonies, whose canker-gnawings give unceasing pain, as one who had lived in the confidence of a pleasant family, and had been privileged to enjoy all the outward pleasures which wealth and standing, in the improving country, secured.</p> 
               <milestone n="--" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>In a mansion of pride and elegance, for a new country, where the forests were not yet cleared, nor all the fields in blooming cultivation, a young man reclined upon a couch, from which he was never to rise-for four years his health had wasted, and it was well nigh spent.</p> 
               <p>An elderly woman bent over him.</p> 
               <p>"What did you say, mother?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Jared Parker is pardoned-he will be home to-morrow-there are strange stories about, my son."</p> 
               <p>For several minutes the young man's glazed eyes were fixed with an unearthly stare upon his mother's countenance; one hand twitched the bed-clothes nervously, the other grasped her wrist.</p> 
               <p>"Mother, I'm a villain," gasped Herbert Williams; "I've a load here, mother," and he pressed his hand on his heart until his breath was almost stopped-"a load, mother; I have wasted under it for years.

               <p>His lips continued to move, but no sound fell from them; the mother bent over her son, bowed down with grief-in a few moments his lips were closed, his brow was clammy-the dews of death were upon it.</p> 
               <p>The mother had a struggle to reveal the confession which exposed her son's deep guilt, but circumstances required it.</p> 
               <p>This confession came to Jared Parker and family with a welcome which did much to soothe their sorrows.</p>

               <head>OUR FIRESIDE.</head> 
               <p>ON an evening early in October, we went from a dismal office, to our humble home in a retired part of the city. There was a cold, drizzling rain falling, and we had neither overcoat nor umbrella. It was a most agreeable surprise, as we opened the parlor door-(there's no hall to our house)-to see a cheerful fire in the grate, shining brightly on the faces in our little home-circle. It was the first fire which had been required on our hearth, and it brought vividly to mind many pleasing reminiscences of times past, when we sat with merry children around the hearth-stone at our father's house; and there came then before us visions of joyful sports, which were suspended, for apples, and nuts, and stories from grandma or grandpa; and we thought of how those children, free from care and full of the wine of life, had been separated and driven about in the strife of business-some of them dying, others dead, others bowed by<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6124-00000086"/> a load of grief and care near the grave-but one or two only well to do and apparently happy in the world. Shaking off these saddening recollections, we were led to think of scenes later in life, when, by a blazing fire on a country hearth, there sat a basket of apples, and near it, on a very plain stand, stood a pitcher of cider, and the old folks had said their prayers, and were sound asleep-and there were but two persons to keep the fire burning, and they sat close together, very close, and they spoke to each other at intervals, in low tones, with a peculiar condescension of manner; all this we thought of, and what else, we will not tell, as our own little folks-two of them-(we have but three, one is yet too much of a baby to run)-bounded toward us with outstretched arms, and we kissed them, and shook hands with wife, and she led us to a cosy little crib where dreamed the latest born. There seemed to be an enlarged, liberal, elevating home-feeling prevailing, and it was all owing to the splashing of the rain on the window panes, and that cheerful fire on the hearth. There was a contrast of comfort in-doors, with discomfort out-of-doors, and it had set wife to thinking of times agone, and the children were in sympathy with her, and she had divined our thoughts at once. We talked of fireside scenes, and we made up our minds to what we shall find many people yield assent, that Spring is pleasant, and always to be greeted with joy, that a welcome is ever to be given to its sunshine and flowers, and that winter is dreary, and to be dreaded; but,. (a sentimental <emph>but,</emph> this,) that among the most pleasant things in home-life is the literal fireside. Is it not to be considered a matter of regret that Spring's long days, in which flowers grow, should require such nights as forbid a fire on the hearth? We'll venture that most men and women associate the sweetest hours of their lives with the fireside in their own or their father's home.</p> 
               <p>Last week, the fire into which we had looked every morning and evening through the Fall and Winter, was permitted to expire-not to be again kindled until some October night, (a night we may never see, nor any of ours) when there shall come the cold rains that fall, as a dark line between the summer in which fruits grow and that known as Indian summer, when fruits are gathered.</p> 
               <p>When we went, after the day's work was done, to our modest parlor, we found the front door open, and eager children before it, ready to greet us. The last ember in the grate had expired-the<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6124-00000087"/> ashes had been removed, and peach and apple-tree twigs, bearing red and white blossoms, exhaled their fragrance whence the blaze of choicest coal had radiated genial warmth.</p> 
               <p>A bar of spring sunshine, which fell through the open door, lay on the hearth, and the youngest child, attracted by its brightness, crept toward it, and put out his little hands, but his head intercepted the sunshine, and his hands were in deep shadow. The mother smiled at his unexpected disappointment, but there was something suggestive in that disappointment, which rendered the smile a sad one. Some day her love may go out after the child, which now casts sunshine on her hearth, and sober gloom may rest where she had anticipated bright joy.</p> 
               <p>All who can appreciate home-sentiment, know what <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"A feeling of sadness and longing,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">That is not akin to pain,</l> 
                        <l>And resembles sorrow only,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">As the mist resembles rain,"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q> may come from the introspection which the charm of the quiet fireside induces, when the winter winds blow and the sleet and the snow drift through darkness against the window pane. Then are memories born which make the fire in the grate the centre of a charmed circle.</p> 
                
               <p>There will be family gatherings, and there will be social meetings, at our own and other homes, when the summer moonlight shall shine on the parlor floor, and the children may be more gleeful than ever they were during the winter time; but our emotions and our reflections shall go out from us, as does the fragrance of the summer flowers go out from them. Thoughts and suggestions shall not be introverted. None of us may feel like looking deeply into each other's eyes, and, speaking low of some friend who was dear to us all, cherish for the future the looks and tones which accompany the mention of the loved one's name. Summer loves and summer memories are sensuous: we enjoy richly, but our joy is fleeting. We remember griefs longer than we do joys, and some of us have sorrows, or recollections bearing sorrows, which are dearer to us than any joy-memory.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps by the fire which went out for the summer last night, dear friends have sat, whose places will know them no more forever. One vacant chair there is in our household, and when he who sat in it went away from earth, never to return, it seemed to us that much of the brightness of our fireside went with him. Perhaps from some other household a child is gone, in the summer of life,<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6124-00000088"/> though in the season of winter; and again, perchance, there is a babe in the house, which was not there when the first bleak wind of winter required the glow in the grate to be enkindled. It may be, a mother is gone, and the little ones sit down and think of the stories she told them, the prayers they repeated after her, and the kisses she gave them, with the fire shining in their faces; or, perhaps, a father has been taken-an aged father-and his sons and daughters, men and women, reflect on the lessons he has given them before the hearth, now gloomy; and when they look on it, they may say:</p> 
               <p>"The dearest memories of our life are clustered there. Let us endeavor, when we have firesides of our own, so to love and so to teach, that our children will find its memories, as we do those of our father's fireside, strengthening and encouraging amid whatever trials and disappointments may be their lot."</p> 
               <p>The dwelling misfortune materially desolates, leaving only love, may have such memories; but that which is only splendid, grave, austere, formal; whose only attraction is its richness, its luxury, where parents, friends, and children, never share each other's joys or griefs, pleasures or plays-such a dwelling is not <q>
                     <l>"Home, sweet home,"</l>
                  </q> in the true sense, and the fireside, to its circle, cannot be the centre of mutual sympathy and support.</p> 
               <p>Rather a martyr had we be, amid the trials of sternest poverty, with fireside memories that were anchors for hope and encouragement, than master of a mansion, from which splendor affrighted quiet home-life-chilled away family comfort.</p> 
               <p>Pity the man, who in haste to become rich, forgets, or foregoes, the pleasures, the satisfaction, the true memories of the fireside. Pity the children who grow up in his household. Like the short-sighted man, before whose eyes there has never been a lens, they do not know what opportunities to treasure the sweetest memories of life, have been forbidden them.</p>

               <head>FASHIONABLE SUICIDE.</head> 
               <p>ELLEN ARTAIN was the pride of the village. She had the handsomest features, the slenderest waist, and the smallest foot of any girl in the town. Her attire was always selected and arranged with the most exquisite taste; and in whatever circle her bright eyes were seen and her sweet voice was heard-for she was a charming vocalist-she was the cynosure of many loving eyes. But Ellen was proud-proud of her handsome face-proud of her tasteful dress-proud of her accomplishments-proud, above all other things, of her slender waist; and it was, indeed, slender-far too slender for the organs of life and motion beneath her corsets, whose healthful play is as necessary to secure elasticity to the beauty's step, and brilliancy to her complexion, as vigor to the athlete's chest and strength to his arm.</p> 
               <p>Ellen's girlish companions wondered she was able "to look so trim" always; they whispered that she would kill herself; but they knew that Ellen's waist was admired-"O, how much!"-by all the young men, and, reckless of consequences, except that sickening one of false admiration, they drew their corset-strings tighter, and wondered if they might not one day become "beauties."</p> 
               <p>Ellen's mother was among those who have gone to the second sphere of human existence; but she had a maiden aunt in this sphere, who counselled her faithfully.</p> 
               <p>"My dear," said this aunt one day, when she particularly observed Ellen's passion for corset-bondage, "you will ruin your health. You lace much too dangerously."</p> 
               <p>"Fie, aunt," said Ellen. "Why, this is nothing. I don't feel uncomfortable; I'm sure it don't hurt me."</p> 
               <p>"You can not take a full inspiration to save your life."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but I can make up for that in short breaths: and who wouldn't rather take short breaths than be a great, ungainly, thick-waisted creature?"</p> 
               <p>"A thick waist, Ellen, with good health, is preferable to a taper waist with continued headache,<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6124-00000090"/> and various other ills to which women are heir. Besides, your waist is not handsome."</p> 
               <p>"Now, aunt, you are not in earnest."</p> 
               <p>"But I am, my dear."</p> 
               <p>"No, no. You do not understand, aunt. I know I am admired for my beautiful waist, and I could not live without admiration. I had rather be killed outright than pine away to the grave."</p> 
               <p>Ellen was dressed for a party when this conversation took place. She, as usual, excited the jealousy of her female friends by the admiration her grace of person and brilliant conversation elicited; and when she was walking in the garden with an intimate friend, the conversation turning upon the company, her companion remarked,</p> 
               <p>"If I knew what it is, Ellen, that makes you so great a favorite, I would suffer any thing to possess it."</p> 
               <p>"You are as handsome as I am, Mary; your eyes are as bright, your features as regular. You are a friend; I'll tell you the secret. Your waist is not as slender as mine; but you need only a little courage to make it equally as handsome."</p> 
               <p>"But I could never do it, Ellen."</p> 
               <p>"Yes you can. Come home with me, and I'll show you how it is done. I did not lace two years ago; I was a plain girl, and as thick-waisted as you are. You know, Mary, I shall soon promise 'to love, honor, and obey' at the altar, and you and I can not be rivals."</p> 
               <p>Mary and Ellen spent the night in each other's company at Ellen's room, and Mary learned the cruel process by which Ellen was enabled to make her person an object of silly pride and foolish wonder. The instrument of torture was a hook in the window-frame, to which was attached a stout cord. This Ellen fastened securely to one end of her corset-string, and then, by throwing her weight upon the cord, she was able to lace herself into "killing dimensions."</p> 
               <p>"But," said Mary, "you do not lace yourself so every time you dress?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no; I could not endure that. I never unloose my corsets from Sunday morning till Saturday night; and if I am going out anywhere, I often give them an extra tightening."</p> 
               <p>"O, it <emph>is</emph> cruel!" ejaculated Mary at the thought of being laced beyond her power of endurance for a whole week. "Why, Ellen, I have only thrown half my weight now on the cord, and I can hardly get my breath."</p> 
               <p>"It will take you but a few weeks to become<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6124-00000091"/> accustomed to it; then you can bear your stays a little tighter, and after a while you can bear any thing."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Ellen, anything in the way of foolish suffering; but what can I bear that my duties as a woman may require me to suffer? The sacrifice is too great."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, Mary; you can never be a belle. Keep your stays on to-night, and I'll warrant you can suffer them tightened to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but how much should I suffer before to-morrow? More than all the silly sayings of admirers could remunerate me for in five years. I thought I could do any thing to be as you are; but my pride was excited then-my good sense is my friend now. Here go these lacers. Now I breathe freely; it is worth a thousand compliments earned at the expense of all physical comfort."</p> 
               <p>"You have grown quite sentimental, Mary; I did not think you were so much of a moralist. I did not sleep for a few nights when I first put my 'patent' into use; but I soon got over that. I am as healthy as you are, Mary."</p> 
               <p>"No, Ellen, you are not. You are beginning to fade, and you are not yet twenty."</p> 
               <p>"Pooh, Mary; you try to frighten me."</p> 
                
               <p>"Indeed, I am serious. Tight lacing is destroying your constitution; your rest is broken; your eyes are not as bright as they used to be."</p> 
               <p>"I should be neglected if that was the case, Mary. Now, am I neglected?"</p> 
               <p>"In company you are animated, and these inroads upon your health are not observed; but now I plainly see them."</p> 
               <p>"It is your imagination, Mary. I am sure I sleep soundly; and I am never sick, unless it is with a slight headache."</p> 
               <p>"And that headache is the forerunner of greater evils."</p> 
               <p>After conversing in this style for half an hour, the girls fell asleep. Mary, whose lungs and other vital organs had full play, arose refreshed. When Ellen awoke, she said,</p> 
               <p>"I am as tired as when I went to bed."</p> 
               <p>"No wonder," answered Mary. "You were restless all night. You do not sleep soundly, Ellen; and it is because you are laced so tightly."</p> 
               <p>"No, Mary. I was not well last evening. I will not believe that my lacing will do me any serious injury."</p> 
               <p>The girls parted: Ellen as tightly laced as ever-as proud and as eager for whimsical admiration,<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6124-00000092"/> at the expense of her health; and Mary, convinced that she could not do as Ellen was doing for all the hollow compliments that silly men repeat to foolish women in the course of a century.</p> 
               <p>Six months elapsed. Ellen Artain had faded wonderfully. She had just risen from a couch on which she had been confined by severe <emph>fever</emph> for several weeks. Her corsets were not as tight as they had been; but still they were closer than any other girl of her acquaintance could have borne. She said she could not sit up without her tightly-laced corsets.</p> 
               <p>She was to be married. He who was to be her husband knew her failing, and he hoped that his counsels might correct her opinions on the one evil. He had often told her that the admiration of her person, which she coveted, was based upon false premises; but so long as words and glances in the promiscuous assembly told her that her "sylph-like form" was the perfection of the prevailing taste, what cared she for the origin of that taste.</p> 
               <p>The wedding-night had arrived. With the Mary to whom the reader has been introduced, and two other companions, Ellen was in her room, testing the fit and fashion of her bridal robes.</p> 
                
               <p>"Now, Ellen," said Mary, "you shall not lace to-night as you have been doing. Let me draw your corset-strings."</p> 
               <p>"If you will not consider that I am yielding to your notions, I'll let you try," returned Ellen archly, putting herself in a position where Mary could execute her wish.</p> 
               <p>"My gracious, Mary!" exclaimed the infatuated girl, "you do not call this lacing? I should not feel that I was dressed. I could scarcely get my breath. I must have something to sustain me during the ceremony. After that I <emph>may</emph> reform; but this night I must be myself. Let me show you."</p> 
               <p>Stepping to the place of <emph>execution,</emph> she fastened the cord to her lacer, as before described, and threw herself upon it. There was a heavy fall. Ellen Artain lay senseless upon the floor; the lacer had broken; the shock was too much for her frail form. When her companions raised her body from the floor, her face was livid, and red drops stood on her lips. Every possible effort was made to restore her with energy and promptness. In an hour she could speak, but could not lift her head from her couch.</p> 
               <p>The wedding-day was postponed. He who was<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6124-00000093"/> to have been a bridegroom felt that, in fact, he must soon be a widower. But Ellen grew stronger, and finally was strong enough to stand without tightly-drawn corsets at the bridal altar. However, she never regained her health. In less than two years after her marriage she died of "<emph>consumption.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>This is a true tale. The circumstances were told the writer by the Mary who is one of its characters, and who is now, it must be confessed, a respectable old maid, with a thick waist, but who might have been a bride had she been willing to take the place Ellen Artain left vacant.</p> 
               <p>The pernicious practice which this sketch reprobates is not as common as it was five years ago, but still it has not been entirely abolished. In various forms and under different disguises it is yet destroying the health and strength of mothers and daughters; and those facts and arguments which forcibly illustrate its great evils should be reiterated till its complete abolition is accomplished.</p>

               <head>PORTLINESS ILLUSTRATED.</head> 
               <p>SQUIRE PORTLY was a jolly, rubicund old gentleman, who, above all things else-his own rotund self scarcely excepted-loved a good dinner. He had a nephew, a thin, spare young man, of studious habits, who had withal a palate that delighted in rich viands, but whose corporosity was of a character requiring Grahamite <foreign xml:lang="LAT">regimene.</foreign> The nephew had a companion who was at antipodes with the Squire. She-for, by the way, this companion was a country cousin-had somewhere got the idea into her head that men naturally "eat to live," not that they "live to eat;" but while she said little to the Squire in favor of this opinion, she often argued with the nephew, that if he would be more abstemious he would be less dyspeptic; if he would make his diet more plain, he would give himself less pain-not have the "blues" near as often-and while digesting less dinner would be able to digest more lessons<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6124-00000094"/> sons. This philosophy was quite rational to the young gentleman, but for some reason he could never make it practical; and so he went on mortifying his peace and comfort to his palate.</p> 
               <p>One evening, uncle, nephew, and country cousin sat at tea, when the Squire called for his bottle of Sherry, and urged the nephew to join him.</p> 
               <p>"Not a drop to-night, uncle," said he; "that dinner was too much for me. I've done nothing this afternoon but attend to it. I'm somehow or other half inclined to think I had better join the temperance society."</p> 
               <p>"Fudge, boy! you're losing your senses; Miss Brownbread has been lecturing you again. She would make a dolt of you. If a man don't enjoy this world, what's the use of being in it?" cried the Squire, shaking his fat finger playfully at his niece.</p> 
               <p>"But do you enjoy it, uncle?" queried the lady.</p> 
               <p>"To be sure I do. What a dinner we did have! Ah, it was a capital treat; and this is excellent Sherry. Come, boy, take some," pouring out a glass and passing it to his nephew, who placed it beside his plate, but refused to taste it.</p> 
                
               <p>"Uncle," said the niece, with a cunning smile, "who complained of the asthma the other night? who puffed and sighed so that we could hear him in every part of the house?"</p> 
               <p>"Shut up, girl; you don't suppose good dinners give people the asthma? Didn't I catch cold sleeping in a room with the window up?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, uncle; but that did not give you the gout, about which you have complained this very afternoon. What is the use of that cane at your elbow? A man of your age should be hale and healthy, especially one with as good a constitution as you have."</p> 
               <p>"Stuff, girl, stuff! Gout! why it's a necessity of my constitution; all portly men have the gout who cannot exercise more than I do."</p> 
               <p>"And who are as fond of rich dinners, uncle," interrupted the niece.</p> 
               <p>"Be still, you shrew! I don't want to talk to you about these things. You will get me out of humor. But my boy shall not be under your influence. I say a man who would live like an Arab in a land of plenty is no man at all. Give me the delicacies of the season, with plenty of old Port for dinner, and prime Sherry for supper,<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6124-00000095"/> and canting Grahamites may preach till they become shadows."</p> 
               <p>"And high livers, uncle, may be given the asthma with every breath of air; may buy crutches on which to lean to favor the gout; may have nothing but dinner in their heads, unless it be the apoplexy; may gorge themselves till their blood becomes so lazy in its flow that they have scarcely energy enough to do any thing but doze-and all for what? pampered appetites, which debase the man while they increase the weight of his body."</p> 
               <p>"I have a notion, uncle, to adopt my cousin's principles," exclaimed the nephew, impatiently.</p> 
               <p>"And you are a fool-a born fool-to be led by a silly girl. What do women know about eating or drinking! I can take Port enough at my dinner to kill half a dozen such girls as this, and not feel it any more than so much water."</p> 
               <p>"But you don't think, uncle, that what would kill half a dozen women would do you no harm, repeated day after day for thirty years?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't think anything about such calculations. I only know that if a man would enjoy this world, he must take it as it goes. God's bounties are not to be misimproved. A man has a right to eat and drink what he pleases; and if he goes to living on dry bread, he must expect to be a mummy. I say, take a little of every thing good that comes along; let your stomach be of some service to you; don't teach it tenderness. You talk about pampering appetites. Here's Miss Brownbread; she has made her stomach as mincing as the manners of a young lady at boarding-school."</p> 
               <p>"But I have no crutches, uncle; I do not keep my room from dinner till tea-time; I never had the gout, nor any of the other ills which <emph>portly</emph> men are heirs to."</p> 
               <p>"This is my house; I'll have no more of it," cried the uncle, testily; then changing his tone, "but we'll not get out of humor. Here's where we always end."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, uncle, 'a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still,'" said the nephew; "but, by the grace of good counsel, I believe I shall hereafter pay more attention to my brains, and less to my stomach."</p> 
               <p>"As <emph>you</emph> please for you, and as <emph>I</emph> please for me. I see the jade Jenny has you under her thumb, and you'll soon be dreaming of 'love in a cottage.' But I was a young man myself once, and<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6124-00000096"/> it's the lot of most of them to be sentimental fools a few years. I had some hopes of you once, but that time is over."</p> 
               <p>"Hearken a moment, uncle. People give very different definitions to the word good. Will you be so kind as to tell us what you consider a good dinner, uncle?" said the niece.</p> 
               <p>"A good dinner, girl-a good dinner, in my opinion, consists of an abundance of the best things the market affords."</p> 
               <p>"But that is rather indefinite, uncle."</p> 
               <p>"Haven't you seen me eat many a dinner, girl, and don't you know that I delight in a bill of fare as copious as Webster's Dictionary, plenty of the substantials, knick-knacks in abundance, a tempting dessert, and a bottle of prime old Port?"</p> 
               <p>"But did you ever reflect, uncle, that while you are having substantials, knick-knacks, dessert, and wine, and think you cannot make a dinner without them all, many a man is seated at his scanty board, making a meal upon plain bread and meat, believing that he lives like a king, and, with sound lungs and swiftly coursing blood, a head free from aches and a clear mind, would ask no greater variety in his food, even were he privileged to dine sumptuously with you every day?"</p> 
                
               <p>"To be sure, girl, to be sure; there are fools of all kinds in this world-fools about eating and fools about drinking; but that is no reason why I should deny myself of the enjoyments of life."</p> 
               <p>"By no means," said the nephew; "but do a muddy brain, a complaining stomach, an elephantine corporation, aches, pains, dyspepsia, hypochondria, and unmitigated laziness, all for the pleasure of a palate led, day after day, farther and farther from the true perception of good--"</p> 
               <p>"Zounds, boy, and you're getting personal," broke out the uncle.</p> 
               <p>"Toward you no more than myself, uncle. You and I both have the complaining stomachs; you have the corporation; we share the aches and pains; I have the muddy brain and the dyspepsia, with its eldest born, hypochondria: and as I was going to say, when you interrupted me, half an hour's sensual <emph>enjoyment</emph> three times a day don't begin to pay me. I am a martyr to the cook and her arts."</p> 
               <p>"To the waiting-maid at our tea-table, <emph>I</emph> should say," cried the uncle, laughing till his ponderous sides shook heartily at what he considered a good hit. "She's the minx who's making you believe a man starved is better than a man well fed. This<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6124-00000097"/> world is coming to a great pass. We shall all be fools one of these days, and feed on air. Temperance societies would take a man's drink away, Grahamites would take his food, some other <emph>ites</emph> want his land, and, next you know, some new <emph>ism</emph> will be after his soul."</p> 
               <p>"It will be hard to find, uncle," said the nephew, "if he buries it beneath such a pile of rubbish as should belong to nobody who would <emph>live</emph> and <emph>move,</emph> as well as have a <emph>being</emph> in this world."</p> 
               <p>"Hang me, if it were anybody else I would trounce him for this talk; but, poor boy, you don't know what you say. Zounds, you <emph>are</emph> a martyr!"</p> 
               <p>"Excuse me, uncle; but if you had said, 'Zounds, <emph>I</emph> am a martyr-a victim to what puts a man on a level with creatures that are fed to be fattened,' you had hit it."</p> 
               <p>"If I'd give you justice, I'd <emph>hit</emph> you with my cane, to punish you for your impudence. But I will excuse you this time, if you will agree to preach no more of your Grahamite fooleries to me for a week."</p> 
               <p>With these words the jovial uncle managed to hobble his weighty corporation toward his sitting-room, and nephew and niece were left for a stroll in the garden.</p> 
                
               <p>A few weeks subsequent to this conversation the Squire had one day been in his sitting-room perhaps half an hour after dinner, when he imagined himself uncomfortably ill, and forthwith, ringing the bell for a servant, he ordered a bottle of Port. He drank freely, but the peculiar oppression which settled upon him was not in the least removed. He had had company to dinner. He had been under the physician's care for some weeks; but his friends were sociable-he must "enjoy" himself with them, and he had indulged in his favorite beverage, "old Port," more freely than even was <emph>his</emph> habit. The evening potations were poorly calculated to remove the effects of former indulgence. The principle of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">similia similibus curantur,</foreign> as the Squire applied it, was not higienic in this instance. He found the sense of oppression deepening upon him. Leaning upon his crutches, he staggered toward the door to call his nephew. He reeled; a dimness gathered about his eyes; he was falling to the floor in a stupor; he stretched out his hand, convulsively, for support, and grasped the bell-handle. A servant promptly answered the summons, and found his master in a fit of apoplexy. The household was alarmed, and medical aid immediately secured.</p> 
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6124-00000098"/> 
               <p>The attack was not a fatal one; but, though the physician put his patient upon a spare diet, and forbid the use of wine <emph>for several days,</emph> the Squire was not convinced that his style of living had the remotest relation to his attack. When his nephew attempted to reason with him, he said-</p> 
               <p>"Fudge! Portly men generally die of apoplexy. It is constitutional. I don't expect to get out of this world in any other way; but that's no evidence that if a man enjoys himself he's to be taken off without warning."</p> 
               <p>The old gentleman's expectations, in reference to the manner of his "taking off," were to be realized. After a second attack he was somewhat more cautious than he had previously been; but caution came to his aid at least ten years too late, and in less than ten months after the tea-table discussion, above detailed, Squire Portly fell a victim to <emph>Port</emph>liness-he was a martyr in high life.</p> 
               <p>The nephew learned a lesson from the fate of his uncle and the counsels of his niece; and although he was not over-careful, he was watchful of himself till the cousin had a position where she could watch and manage for him.</p>

               <head>KITCHEN COMFORTS.</head> 
               <p>WE accepted a polite invitation from a friend in the country to spend a night at his farm-house. It was a stormy day-the wind was keenly sharp, and a light snow, which filled the air, was whirled upon us in irregular showers. Chilled to the bone, we looked forward eagerly to the blazing fire on the wide hearth in the ample farm-house, and indulged pleasing reminiscences of days gone, when it was often our privilege to meet merry children at a farmer's fireside, where hearty sport was encouraged, where we used to look for big apples and nuts, and capacious mugs of cider, and huge cakes.</p> 
               <p>It made no difference to us then, if the kitchen was the place where the old folks sat, and where company was received; it was our play-house, and we were occupied in joyous sport. But, as we grew older, we thought it strange that the independent farmer did not have more books and<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6124-00000099"/> pictures in his house, and did not occupy with his family, more frequently, some other room than the kitchen; for his house was large, and had many apartments.</p> 
               <p>Thus occupying ourself with recollections of the past and hopes for the future, we spurred our horse forward, but it was night-fall before man or beast was hospitably cared for, and then, did we sit down before that roaring fire, which had been blazing before us all day? Not at all. We had forgotten modern improvements, and the price of wood. A mammoth cooking-stove stood on the hearth, and though it warmed the kitchen thoroughly, it failed to throw over it that cheerful glow which was imparted from, and that social sentiment which gathered around the old-fashioned fireside. Surely, thought we, a man who owns one hundred acres of land worth one hundred dollars an acre, who has a splendid house well furnished, who has a barn well filled, and money in the bank, does not make his kitchen, with its cheerless aspect and its common-place associations, the family home. But it was so. In that farmer's house but one newspaper was received;-even the parlor-and there was a parlor-had no pictures-no musical instruments. Except on Sun day, when the minister came, or when the farmer's daughters had company, the kitchen was the only room in the house where a fire was built, and there the family sat silent; not sad, but not joyous, during all the long winter evenings.</p> 
               <p>
                  <emph>We</emph> had no reason to complain. We were treated most hospitably. Certainly the kitchen was good enough for us, but it was not good enough for the farmer's family. He estimated the value of corn, and wheat, and cattle, more carefully than he did the value of elevating home associations. His girls said, "Oh, how we should like a magazine and a piano," and his boys said, "How much we desire the new books that are being published;" but the father counted the interest on the money he had in the bank, and said, "We can't afford to buy books and music. I have got to make some provision for you all in the world."</p> 
               <p>He forgot, thoughtless man, that knowledge, elevating associations, and dear home-ties, ties which none of the rude shocks we meet in the world can sunder, are worth <emph>more</emph> than houses and lands or gold and silver.</p> 
               <p>Money in music, and books, and pictures, which give an attractive delight to the home circle, returns<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6124-00000100"/> turns often a better percent to a hopeful father than money in banks or railway stocks. Extravagance is always to be reprehended, and there may be extravagance in money-getting as well as in money-spending. When we are able to have homes, their judicious adornment, through efforts to make them delightful to ourselves and our children, is a duty higher than money hoarding.</p> 
               <p>There is a remunerative philosophy in this view of home life, and our farmers should study and practice it more; but there are others than farmers who might profitably give it heed, who, in cities, have no money for music, and books, and pictures, who cannot go to lectures and concerts, but who smoke the best cigars and patronize the richest saloons.</p>

               <head>MARRIAGE BY DRAFT.</head> 
               <p>NOT more than a quarter of a century ago, at a picturesque point on the Kentucky river, stood half a dozen log cabins, the smoke from which curled among huge forest trees that had been girdled, and whose dry limbs, under the influence of summer suns and winds, fell among fields of young grain and thriving tobacco.</p> 
               <p>When neatly constructed white cottages began to take the place of rough cabins, and gardens bloomed where massive oaks had grown; when the tavern and the store, the shoe-shop and the grocery had become lounging places on rainy days and holidays, the people bethought them that the town should be christened.</p> 
               <p>This ceremony was performed with due solemnity, and the young village was "booked" Marysville, after the name of the first child born within it. Then all the single men under fifty years of age, held a formal meeting, and resolved that, in all future time, every young lady who<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6124-00000101"/> visited the place, and expressed herself pleased with it, should have an offer of marriage from some member of the association, and if no one volunteered, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau</foreign> was to be selected by draft from among all who had signed the articles of government. The operation of this resolution, for two or three years, was a capital subject of gossip, and afforded much amusement. A goodly number of excellent matches were made, but many a bashful young fellow was compelled to "pop the question," hoping that his suit would be rejected, and not a few young ladies were provided with husbands, who might else have grown gray in the solitude of "single blessedness."</p> 
               <p>When lovers were diffident, it frequently happened that the drafts fell in such a manner as to interfere seriously with the "course of true love," and while a majority of the association might be well pleased with the turn luck had taken, perhaps two individuals would be thrown into awkward and unpleasant quandaries.</p> 
               <p>The village school was taught by a young lady, who had for some months been a frequent subject of discussion in the association. Lots had not been cast for the selection of her husband <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in prospectu,</foreign> because it was well known that a young man, in general favor, had been paying her marked attention, and it was hoped he would be a volunteer.</p> 
               <p>Frequent hints were given him, but to no purpose. He was absent on one occasion from a meeting of the singular association, when the fate of the school-mistress was decided. The lot fell upon the eldest member, a man considered to be an incorrigible bachelor, who had been about one year a resident of the village, and who endeared himself to all the people by his kind-heartedness and general benevolence. He was reputed to be a man of wealth. What influenced him to take up his residence at Marysville no one knew. He had no relatives in the vicinity, and he was not there for business purposes. When it became known that Mr. Marley was to propose to the school-mistress, much speculation was indulged, and many a lively laugh was provoked at his expense. It was generally supposed that he would make the proposal, as a matter of formality, but in such a manner that it could only be taken as a joke, and many of the young girls prepared themselves for rare sport in "teasing" the "<emph>to be Mrs. Marley.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Alice Sefton lived with her mother, a sprightly<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6124-00000102"/> woman of middle age, in a pretty cottage, a short distance from the village. The second evening after the association had provided her a husband, she stood by the garden gate, when she was met by a young man who, without ceremony, led her to a seat and said:</p> 
               <p>"Now, Alice, for that secret; I know what our Bachelor Association did night before last, and I am aware that the old gentleman paid you a visit last evening. I suspect the secret you would tell me is, that you were under the necessity of declining his honorable proposal."</p> 
               <p>"But I did <emph>not</emph> decline it!" said Alice, with her eyes on the garden walk.</p> 
               <p>"You did not <emph>accept</emph> it?" returned the young man with a start.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I did not exactly accept his proposal to <emph>marry</emph> me," answered Alice, "but I consented, for sufficient reasons, that to-morrow week, when my school closes, there shall be a wedding in this house."</p> 
               <p>"And how the deuce can that be, unless <emph>you</emph> get married?" inquired Frank Bertley, for <emph>he</emph> was none other than the lover of whom the association could not make a volunteer.</p> 
               <p>"I know <emph>I</emph> shall not marry <emph>him,</emph> Frank. Am I not already affianced to you? But I am sure I cannot tell how the singular affair <emph>will</emph> end."</p> 
               <p>"If you don't marry him or <emph>me,</emph> there can't be a marriage, unless he should propose and be accepted by your mother. By-the-by, it would be a capital match."</p> 
               <p>"Don't talk so, Frank."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I am sure it seems to me quite likely that such a thing might happen."</p> 
               <p>"Never!" returned Alice, with emotion.</p> 
               <p>Frank observed her agitation, and guessing at the cause, remarked,</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps this has something to do with the secret you promised to tell me."</p> 
               <p>"It has, Frank, much to do with it."</p> 
               <p>"But how is Mr. Marley concerned in it?"</p> 
               <p>"He is not concerned in it at all, only he was the first one to whom it was told, and since then he has behaved very strangely."</p> 
               <p>"I am all impatience to know what it can be."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I have told you, Frank, that we once lived in England, that mother came over to this country when I was quite a small girl, and you have always understood that father was dead."</p> 
               <p>"I have."</p> 
               <p>"It is not so-that is, we do not know that it is<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6124-00000103"/> so. Soon after I was born, father suddenly disappeared; for a long time, mother thought he must have been murdered, but at length she received a letter dated New York, which announced his safe arrival in America, and contained means with directions for us to join him; mother determined to do so immediately. We had a nice cottage-she sold it, and we came to America to seek father. We have lived in this country fifteen years; but have never yet had the slightest trace of him. One evening last spring, mother was at work in our little garden, when Mr. Marley stopped at the gate and begged a rose; she gave it to him. They had been partially acquainted some time, and he inquired so pleasantly about our concerns and our history, that mother (her heart at that hour happening to be full of sad remembrances) told him all. Since that time his conduct has many times been singular. I have often suspected that he must know something about father. When he came up here last night, mother was out; he joked me about the luck that had fallen upon him, and said he was sorry he was not as young and good-looking a man as Frank Bertley, but hoped I would consider that age was honorable in making my decision. I blushed deeply at his reference to you, but saw all the time that he was quizzing me, and I made him an answer in the same vein, when he said-</p> 
               <p>"'This is trifling; I have something to tell you, Miss Alice. You are aware that I know you have been searching for a father many years; consent that there shall be a wedding in this house next week, on a day I shall appoint-let the people of the village know it, and you <emph>shall find a father.</emph> You can trust me. Your mother must not hear a word of it, unless it come from the people of the village, but you may consult Mr. Bertley, and tell him he <emph>must</emph> be present.'"</p> 
               <p>"This is a queer affair," interrupted Frank, "but you <emph>agreed</emph> to this proposal, did you?"</p> 
               <p>"After some objections, I did. I do not believe he is a man who would abuse a respect for a lost parent. He may have some important object in the course he has taken, and I shall obey his instructions."</p> 
               <p>"But who do you suppose is to be the bride and groom?"</p> 
               <p>"I presume he will be the groom, but who the bride shall be, I am sure I cannot tell."</p> 
               <p>"Let us play them a little trick, Alice. Your mother has consented to our union, let us fix the<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6124-00000104"/> day Marley has selected, and have a wedding here he little thinks of."</p> 
               <p>"Would it be fair, Frank?"</p> 
               <p>"To be sure it would. It will be so nice to deceive the villagers."</p> 
               <p>Alice could not withhold her consent, and Frank Bertley went home that night congratulating himself on the prospect of playing a capital trick on his bachelor friends of the Association.</p> 
               <p>Marriage intelligence was rapidly conveyed in country villages long before magnetic telegraphs were thought of; and, as soon as it became known that there was to be a marriage at widow Sefton's the next week, the story spread, that, "wondrous to relate," old Mr. Marley had been accepted by Alice.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>The evening subsequent to that on which Alice and Frank had the interview above recorded, Mrs. Sefton was visiting at the village; Mr. Marley escorted her to her cottage; their conversation pertained to an event that was to transpire in less than seven days.</p> 
               <p>Said Mr. Marley, "You were kind enough to confide in me, Mrs. Sefton. I have become attached to you and your excellent daughter. I want a home-your cottage would just suit me."</p> 
                
               <p>"But, Mr. Marley, you know it cannot be. I have been searching many years for a lost husband. I shall believe him living until I am informed of his death."</p> 
               <p>"Were you satisfied that your union with me would in no manner interfere with your determinations on this point, could you grant my suit?"</p> 
               <p>"I esteem you highly, Mr. Marley, but it is not proper that I should now answer this proposal."</p> 
               <p>"I know more than you believe I do, Mrs. Sefton. Upon the honor of a gentleman, I assure you that our union can take place."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you to be a man of honor, Mr. Marley, but I would see the proofs."</p> 
               <p>"Consent, and you shall have them. Let me appoint Thursday of next week. You know the joke played upon me by the Bachelor Association of the village. Let it be known that there shall then be a wedding at your house, and let the people guess who shall be the bride and groom, and I will give you "confirmation strong as proofs of holy writ" of all I have told you, or the marriage shall be void, and I'll consent to be branded as a villain. Dare you trust me?"</p> 
               <p>"I dare. I cannot believe you would deceive me."</p> 
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6124-00000105"/> 
               <p>"Then I have only one boon to ask. I have an object in it. Allow me to talk to Alice about your intentions. I shall not tell her unless she promises not to converse with <emph>any</emph> person about them. You may think I act strangely, but all shall be explained."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Sefton consented that Mr. Marley should have his <emph>whims</emph> gratified. He gave a hint to several of his particular female friends, and for one week the tea-tables of Marysville were furnished with a subject for the most entertaining conversation.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Alice Sefton's school had been dismissed. She was engaged with a bevy of young girls, hanging garlands of summer flowers around the front room of her mother's cottage; one of her companions said-</p> 
               <p>"I could not believe that you were going to marry Mr. Marley. He is a nice man, but he is <emph>so</emph> old."</p> 
               <p>"Not over forty-five," returned Alice.</p> 
               <p>"Forty-five! A husband of forty-five for a girl not twenty, when a handsome <emph>young</emph> man is desperately in love with her. I am sure I had much rather have Frank Bertley than <emph>old</emph> Mr. Marley," said another of the young ladies, as she coquetishly bound up a bouquet of flowers.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Bertley will be obliged to you for your good opinion, for I know he respects Mr. Marley very much. Shall I tell him?" replied Alice.</p> 
               <p>"If you please," mischievously answered the girl. "Perhaps we shall have a double wedding."</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best to bring it about," said Alice.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," returned her friend.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Sefton now entered the room, and told Alice it was time she was in her dressing-room, as the company had begun to arrive. A couple of her companions withdrew to assist her, while the others finished the decorations of the cottage.</p> 
               <p>The sun was throwing lengthy shadows eastward, when a gay company, in their holiday attire, were having sprightly sports in and about widow Sefton's cottage. The guests were numerous for a country town. Alice, Mrs. Sefton, and Mr. Marley had a large circle of friends, and nearly all the invited were present, because the talk in the village had given the expected marriage a kind of romantic or mysterious air, and a real novelty in quiet, out-of-the-way country towns, always has many patrons.</p> 
               <p>The guests began to grow impatient for the anticipated<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6124-00000106"/> ticipated ceremonies. The venerable minister had been waiting some time, but the expected bridegroom did not arrive. Mrs. Sefton's anxiety was quite manifest, and it was evident Alice feared something had occurred which would interrupt <emph>the</emph> nuptials. A horseman was seen at the garden gate; he dismounted, and, walking rapidly to the cottage, handed Alice a note. She read with a manner which betrayed much deep agitation.</p>

               <p>Here was not a word of explanation; the conduct of the company demanded one, and Alice handed the letter to her mother, asking that it should be read aloud.</p> 
               <p>"Witness the marriage," said Mrs. Sefton.</p> 
               <p>"How strange," said one of the company.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Marley's a gentleman," said another; "I don't understand this, but it must be all right."</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Frank Bertley, "we are here to have a wedding, and I don't see but we can have it as well without Mr. Marley as with him. What say you, Alice?"</p> 
                
               <p>"There is nothing wanting but the bride and groom," returned Alice.</p> 
               <p>"I am sure you are dressed like a bride, and, with Mrs. Sefton's permission, I can personate the groom."</p> 
               <p>"But Alice is engaged to Mr. Marley," said the young girl who had spoken favorably of Frank.</p> 
               <p>"Then she is twice engaged," returned Frank, roguishly. "How is it, Alice?"</p> 
               <p>"I see <emph>I</emph> must explain, kind friends," said Alice. "Mr. Marley did not expect to wed me. You have had your gossip and your jokes, and you will not be angry with me when I tell you that I only agreed with Mr. Marley that there should be a wedding at our house to-day. I supposed he would bring a bride. I do not understand his note, but Mr. Bertley and I having intended to surprise you, independently of the Bachelor Association, I see no reason why <emph>I</emph> should not be a bride."</p> 
               <p>"And Alice," interrupted Mrs. Sefton, "is this all Mr. Marley explained to you?"</p> 
               <p>"It is, mother, except that-"</p> 
               <p>"Do not speak it. He has deceived me. He is a villain."</p> 
               <p>"You judge a friend too harshly, madam," said S<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6124-00000107"/> a person who had unperceived stepped within the door.</p> 
               <p>"Explain, sir," demanded Frank Bertley, approaching the stranger.</p> 
               <p>"He promised Alice Sefton that she should this day find a father. That promise shall not be broken. Show this ring to Mrs. Sefton."</p> 
               <p>Frank passed the jewel as directed, and Mrs. Sefton, walking near the stranger, exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"It was my husband's; I gave it to him on the day of our marriage! Does he live?" Do you know where he lives? Have you seen him?"</p> 
               <p>"He has been my constant companion for years."</p> 
               <p>"Does he know that we live-that I am here?"</p> 
               <p>"Anna, look at me," said the stranger, as he removed his hat.</p> 
               <p>"It is he-<emph>it is he,</emph>" she cried, and fell into her long-lost husband's arms."</p> 
               <p>There was great surprise amongst the company, all of whom, but Bertley, believed Mrs. Sefton to be a widow. Alice was embraced by her father, and then explanations were made, when Mrs. Sefton said to her husband-</p> 
               <p>"Tell me, Charles, do you know Mr. Marley?"</p> 
               <p>"Intimately, Anna. It was by information from him that I am here," replied the husband.</p> 
                
               <p>"Then I have judged him wrongfully," the wife answered, "and at the first opportunity shall beg his pardon, and return him a thousand thanks. I wish he could be with us this evening."</p> 
               <p>"He shall be. When I slipped in here, I left him but a few rods distant. I will seek him."</p> 
               <p>Saying these words, Mr. Sefton stepped from the cottage, and disappeared in a clump of bushes at the foot of the garden. In less than five minutes Mr. Marley was announced by congratulations from the company generally, and Mrs. Sefton gave him her hand, remarking-</p> 
               <p>"You deceived me slightly, but I forgive you heartily, and beg pardon for having condemned you hastily on reading your unexplainable note to Alice."</p> 
               <p>"You served me right. I deserved it all. But where is Mr. Sefton. I must congratulate him. He is an old acquaintance, and I respect him highly."</p> 
               <p>"Did he not send you here just now? Is he not in the garden?" cried Mrs. Sefton, looking around to see if her husband had not returned.</p> 
               <p>"I saw him not-no one has spoken to me," replied Mary.</p> 
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6124-00000108"/> 
               <p>Mrs. Sefton was bewildered with the complication of mysteries, when Bertley exclaimed-</p> 
               <p>"An idea strikes me!"</p> 
               <p>"Hold, young man," cried Marley, and whirling suddenly about, he held a black wig, with neatly-trimmed whiskers attached, in his hand-half a dozen voices exclaimed:</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Sefton! Mr. Marley! We have all been cheated."</p> 
               <p>We need hardly add that Mrs. Sefton was satisfied with the proofs Mr. Marley had given-that she would fully respect her early love in consenting to their <emph>union.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>The nuptials of Frank and Alice were solemnized, and for that evening there was indeed a "merrie companie" at the Sefton cottage. When Alice had an opportunity to converse with her father, she said-</p> 
               <p>"I wonder we did not suspect you sooner. Indeed I have thought for some time that you knew something about father. But why did you remain <abbr>incog.</abbr> so long?"</p> 
               <p>"You did not know me, Alice," he replied, "and before you knew I was your father I wished you to love me. I had been absent from your mother so long, too, that I did not know her feelings ings, and I resolved that before I made myself known, I would gain her consent to marry me as a stranger. It was given in a manner to assure me, and my luck in the Bachelor's Club afforded me a chance to carry out my plans. In England we were not known as Seftons, but, as under this name we have been united, we shall hereafter be known by it."</p> 
               <p>As Mr. Sefton said these words to Alice, Mrs. Sefton approached, and giving her a chair so that he sat between mother and daughter, he continued,</p> 
               <p>"It is a little strange that I had not met you in some of my travels. Perhaps I have, but did not know you."</p> 
               <p>"And how were we at length discovered to you?" inquired Mrs. Sefton, affectionately.</p> 
               <p>"I had been engaged in speculations at Louisville, and was called to this town on business, when Alice happened in at the village store where I was conversing with a gentleman. Her striking resemblance to you, Anna, in your youth, struck me. I made inquiries, and learned your history, as the people of the village knew it. A pleasant suspicion fastened upon me. I came here disguised, in the manner you have known me, as<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6124-00000109"/> Marley, determined to know all. I was satisfied, and resolved to gain the love and respect of mother and daughter, as Mr. Marley, and then make myself known as Mr.-, no, not that-Mr. Sefton. Fortune has favored me in this country, and tomorrow I shall settle upon Alice a handsome marriage portion. Does Alice know the wicked cause of my sudden abandonment of you in England?"</p> 
               <p>"She does not," answered Mrs. Sefton, sadly.</p> 
               <p>"Then I will confess to her. Call your husband, Alice."</p> 
               <p>In a moment Bertley joined the family group.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sefton addressed him: "Let what may happen to you, never harrass your wife with petty jealousy. You look surprised. You will not feel so when I confess that foolish, unjust jealousy made me desert my home. In one month calm reflection proved to me that I had been in deep error. I would then have returned to my home like the penitent prodigal, but thought it would be best for us to become American citizens, and in order to husband our little means, I wrote her a letter begging her to join me. I got tidings from England before my wife was prepared to emigrate, and he of whom I had been jealous had assisted her to settle her business. I heard no more. I will not speak of fifteen years of suffering on her part-of atonement on mine. You know the rest. I was a petty tyrant, disturbed on my self-raised throne whenever a compliment was paid to my wife, or she spoke to or about other men. Enough-I have no fears of you, Frank."</p> 
               <p>Frank Bertley smiled at the thought that he could ever be a tyrant over his sweet Alice; she confidingly returned his smile, and the family group mingled with the "merrie companie" of Mrs. Sefton's cottage parlor.</p>

               <head>A LESSON FROM THE STREET.</head> 
               <p>THERE are pictures on every city street which convey lessons of great practical force. From the dandy as well as from the loafer-from the beggar as well as from the clown, we may derive knowledge, if we shrewdly study their characters, and treasure up for reflection, the contrasts they present. Peculiar characters impress us, though we may but glance at them. We often gain lessons which are but little heeded at the time they come to us, but which yet exert a saving influence on our minds, and become valuable among the treasures of experience.</p> 
               <p>The shudder which creeps over every man and every woman, even though he or she may not possess very delicate sensibility, when a fellow-being reels along the side-walk, under the influence of intoxicating drinks, has a grave lesson in it.</p> 
               <p>That society is indeed wretched, in which a drunken man can move without exciting disgust and even terror. Children universally are struck with terror at the sight of a human being, whose will and reason having been overcome by strong drink, goes zig-zag, and with frequent stumblings along the street. And well may such a being be a terror to them. They have not become familiar with the vice which social life encourages, till it well nigh verges upon beastiality. They do not reflect that the drunkard is only one step lower than he who loves to treat and be treated. They see only something to them terrible, and they fly from it without asking excuses for themselves on the object of their dread. Would that such sights could always prove a warning, which no familiarity with genteel drinking could ever after deaden. There would soon be none of them.</p> 
               <p>One day, I was walking in the southern part of the city of Cincinnati, when I heard a child scream violently. I knew it was either in great pain or deep terror. I looked around for it, and saw a little boy, not over four years of age, dancing before the door of a mean-looking house, and screaming with all his might. My first impression was that his little fingers had been caught, when the door was shut, and had been most severely pinched<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6124-00000111"/> ed. I started hastily to go to him, when I saw him run, and scream louder than before. The cause was apparent. A drunken man was reeling toward him. The drunkard took a step after the boy, who saw him, and his terror was increased, and he ran into an adjoining confectionery shop, and hid under the counter. The drunken man was about to enter the shop, but the proprietor stood in the door and forbid him.</p> 
               <p>"I'll have my boy," said the drunkard.</p> 
               <p>"Not till you are sober," answered the shopkeeper.</p> 
               <p>Swearing a great oath, the drunken man cried, "You will see if I don't," and he staggered into the street to pick up a stone.</p> 
               <p>He would have thrown it at the shop-keeper, but at the moment he swung it over his head, his wife rushing from her house, caught his arm. He turned to strike her, but several persons surrounded him. Presently a watchman came, and swearing bitterly at the shop-keeper, the drunkard was dragged away to get sober in the city prison.</p> 
               <p>I stood near the afflicted wife, who looked after her drunken husband, with tears in her eyes, and her hands clasped. I ventured to converse with her. When I had asked several questions which conveyed sympathy, I said:</p> 
               <p>"Why was the little boy so much afraid of his father?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, sir, he beats him. He's a little boy, sir, but he knows how dreadful it is."</p> 
               <p>"Does he ever abuse you?" I asked.</p> 
               <p>"Only when I interfere to save the boy. Sometimes, sir, I wish the Lord would take him; but, sir, he's my only comfort."</p> 
               <p>The afflicted woman turned to meet her boy, who just then came out of his hiding-place, and when I saw him run to his mother, and clasp her hand, and hide his face in the folds of her dress, I went on my way.</p> 
               <p>Was there not a grave lesson in the terror of that boy? Scarcely old enough to express in words, his thanks for his mother's care, he was inspired with uncontrollable dread at the sight of his drunken father. The burden of sorrows and heart-burnings that boy's mother had to bear, no words can tell.</p> 
               <p>What a father was that! What hopes in life! What joys in store for that boy, with such experience in his early youth! Can he ever forget the terrors of his childhood?"</p> 
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6124-00000112"/> 
               <p>Let us reflect upon the character such a father's influence must give to the home of his wife and boy. Is not the lesson taught by that child's terror-incited impulse to flee from his parent, sufficient in itself, if given its due weight, to reform every man who ever went home drunk? If any such a man read this sketch, let him think.</p>

               <head>PAY AS YOU GO.</head> 
               <p>THERE is not quite as much originality, as there is prejudice, in the world, else men and women would not so often be led into extravagance and difficulty, by the example of others. Too many people are prone to do as their neighbors, simply because said neighbors have numerous servants, own a front pew in a fashionable church, and ride in a handsome carriage. It is very well that we should imitate our neighbors when they do right; but, unfortunately, we are oftener inclined to pattern after the cut of their coats, or the taking style of their bonnets, than to imitate their social excellencies or private virtues.</p> 
               <p>Many times the passion, to look as well as other people, is encouraged at the expense of more important matters. Then, as poor Richard says in his almanac, we "pay too dear for the whistle."</p> 
               <p>"Turn over a new leaf," is a good proverb for more than one man and one woman in every community<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6124-00000113"/> munity. There can be no better time for opening a clean page than on the opening of a new year.</p> 
               <p>I know a man who, on New Year's day (1854), turned over a new leaf, which has proved of great profit to him.</p> 
               <p>He was a young merchant. His store had been open but a few months; and, as he was doing a good business, he could afford to be quite liberal in his household. His wife had as pretty a home as any young merchant's wife in the city, and she had as pretty dresses as any woman on the street where she lived, and she took great delight in the consciousness of the fact, that she was pretty and was prettily attired; so did her husband.</p> 
               <p>There was some talk that the wife was a little extravagant, but it did not affect the merchant's business, and the number of her admirers continued to increase.</p> 
               <p>The pretty little woman had so many pretty things, that it would have been a great pity for her to stay at home all the time, and show them only to her husband. She was of a benevolent turn of mind, and, consequently, she desired that other people should take pleasure in them as well as he. So she went frequently to balls and concerts.</p> 
                
               <p>The season advanced; winter set in; business became dull, and money was scarce, but balls and parties and concerts were numerous, and, to all the best, went the young merchant and his pretty wife. They made fashionable friends, and there were inviting suppers given at their house.</p> 
               <p>As the New Year drew nigh, Mr. Farley began to realize a pressure in the money market. He would have been glad to reduce his current expenses, but, oh, it would break his wife's heart to deny her, and his credit was good.</p> 
               <p>The pretty wife sat beside her husband on a pretty sofa, when she looked lovingly in his eyes, and said-</p> 
               <p>"You couldn't guess who was here to-day?"</p> 
               <p>Of course he couldn't; so she told him-</p> 
               <p>"It was Mrs. P. Her folks are all going to the theatre on New Year's night. There's to be such a pretty piece played. I do wish we could go, but I havn't a bonnet that's fit. Mrs. P. Had on a love to-day; it became her so much."</p> 
               <p>The merchant had a letter for his wife from her paternal home. He had forgotten to speak of it before, but instantly it occurred to him when his wife hinted at a new bonnet. He knew his notes<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6124-00000114"/> in bank would require all the money he could command for that week.</p> 
               <p>The wife read the letter hastily, and, perplexity to the husband! it was from a younger sister, and nearly all about fashions and flounces, furbelows and laces, beaux and amusements. A new bonnet was described; the wife read the description, and added a graphic picture of the very pretty bonnet Mrs. P. had worn.</p> 
               <p>The merchant was compelled to consider the bonnet question, and he told his wife he thought he might arrange his affairs, so he and she could go with Mrs. P. and her folks to the theatre.</p> 
               <p>Christmas came, and it cost Mr. Farley a fair round sum. He was in a fever to retrench, but how could he without letting his wife know that his affairs were much embarrassed; and surely some of his friends would assist him if he should not be able, out of his own resources, to meet his pecuniary engagements. He must make his wife some kind of a New-Year present, and it might as well be a new bonnet, to be exhibited first on that eventful day, and then worn to Mr. P.'s in the evening, to be left for inspection and comparison, while the ladies went, with veils on their heads, to see the pretty New-Year piece, which was to be performed at the theatre. Of all this the pretty wife was duly advised, and her generous heart swelled with gratitude-not pride. Her husband was the kindest, best man in the world.</p> 
               <p>On the last day of December, a heavy note against Mr. Farley fell due. He had not the money to meet it. He went up street and down street to borrow-he tried friend after friend-but money was very "tight." The hour for closing the banks was drawing near; the merchant was in deep perplexity-how many times he thought of old sayings about "fair-weather friends;" but bitter thoughts would not pay his note.</p> 
               <p>He sat down, and wrote in his memorandum book the names of such friends as he had not called upon, who, he was certain, might help him if they would. He went to one and another with a heavy heart. He was not cordially received. One had been disappointed, money promised him had not come-a second was very "short" that day-a third had just paid his last five dollars on a little account, several heavy bills had been met that day. At length the harrassed merchant became discouraged, and to a usurer he went, determined, at some rate, to have the money he needed. The usurer knew he had a desperate man to deal with,<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6124-00000115"/> and he drove a hard bargain. He took a judgment note at twenty days, and Mr. Farley had money enough to meet his obligations, and buy his wife a new bonnet.</p> 
               <p>He went to bed that night with a heavy heart, but when, in the morning, his wife greeted him with a cordial "Happy New Year," his heart was cheered, and it gave him pleasure to think how much joy she would have when the new bonnet and the new dress, he had bought as a New-Year gift, were sent home. She did not say a word about presents, but there was a peculiar twinkle in her eye, and a knowing smile, half expressed, on her lips.</p> 
               <p>It was yet rather early for callers when the door bell rang. The wife was too impatient to wait the slow motions of a servant, and she answered it herself. A little boy had caused its welcome tintinnabulum, and he had a band-box under his arm.</p> 
               <p>A happier wife there was not in the world. She bestowed upon her husband the fondest of caresses, and could only speak of him as a dear sweet man. He forgot usurers and notes in bank, and went to the theatre, and saw everybody admire his pretty wife in her new dress, with such satisfaction as a doting husband can alone appreciate. The New-Year Year bonnet was "a little gem" in the opinion of all Mrs. P.'s folks, and that added another large drop to the cup of joy, from which the young wife drank in the fulness of grateful love.</p> 
               <p>One month in the new year had not passed before she drank from another cup-a cup of bitterness. Her husband was not at home regularly, and when at home, he was gloomy always-sometimes sullen; he became haggard in his appearance-he denied his wife any confidence in regard to what weighed upon him. She had no surmise of the true cause of his depression of spirits, and she borrowed grievous trouble about it. The new dress afforded her no comfort now-she had no joy in her "love of a bonnet"-balls and concerts had no attractions-the husband made a show of cheerfulness to the wife, and the wife smiled faintly in return, but both recognized mutual deception, and the once happy home became a place of torment to its occupants. The husband shunned it, and the wife wept in it. The note given to the usurer meantime fell due. He would extend the time at the same high rate of usury on which the money for it was given, and this bankrupt policy was a necessity of the merchant's circumstances-he dare not let his business creditors know that<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6124-00000116"/> he was the victim of a "keen shave"-and week after week he paid the usurer money, which, if invested in his business, would have relieved, while its loss created additional, embarrassment.</p> 
               <p>Every day the load of care which he carried from his store to his home increased in weight, and at last he became so morose that his wife's patience was tried beyond endurance. She grew as peevish as he was sullen. The poor man did not condemn her, but he could not always brook her peevishness, and the smooth current of domestic felicity which had flowed through their household, was changed into a brawling stream, whose waters were embittered with discontent and peevish bickerings.</p> 
               <p>The wife neglected domestic duty, and the merchant neglected business, till he was sorely pressed to pay the usurer the weekly sum which kept a sheriff from his store.</p> 
               <p>One day he was in a very unhappy mood. He had been home for his dinner, and everything about the house seemed to reproach him. He was tempted to open his heart to his fading wife, but his courage failed him-he returned to his store, thinking of what his fashionable acquaintances might be saying about the marked change which had come over him and his wife.</p> 
               <p>He had not yet been able to cast out such perplexing reflections when the usurer's collector, with a bow and a patronizing smile, entered the store and presented the uneasy merchant with a receipt for another installment of interest.</p> 
               <p>The merchant snatched the piece of paper and tore it into small fragments very deliberately, while the astonished collector thrust his hands very deep into his breeches pockets.</p> 
               <p>"Get out of my store!" cried the merchant; "go and tell your master I'll never pay him another cent. He can sell me out as soon as he pleases. I have paid him now in <emph>interest</emph> more than half the original sum. I'll pay him no more, I tell you; let him get it all. Leave my store, sir."</p> 
               <p>Out went the collector in nervous trepidation, and with him went a burden the merchant had borne far too long.</p> 
               <p>He was entirely prepared to meet the usurer when, an hour afterward, he called to propose a compromise-he would be very sorry to levy on any goods, he thought some arrangement might be made.</p> 
               <p>"No, sir," answered the merchant. "Get your<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6124-00000117"/> money as best you can. I made an assignment an hour ago-make your levy when you please, and sell what is necessary to pay you, and other creditors will take the remainder. I've turned over a new leaf. I'm a happy man now, compared to what I was yesterday."</p> 
               <p>The usurer went away thinking the merchant demented-entirely out of his wits; but the merchant hastened home with the light of joy in his eye-a light which flowed out of a heart over which indecision had for a long time exercised a sorrowful influence.</p> 
               <p>There he met his wife; she looked sadder to him than she had ever done before. He had designed to greet her with a cheerful face and an affectionate manner, but his loving design was frustrated by her appearance.</p> 
               <p>In a very sad tone, she invited him into the parlor-there she threw herself upon her knees and sobbed, "O! it's frightful." He would have lifted her up, but she begged him to hear her, and she sobbed again.</p> 
               <p>"I was on the street, this morning, and I accidently heard two men talk about you. They said you were a bankrupt, and it was because of your wife's extravagance. Tell me, is it true?"</p> 
                
               <p>"I am a broken merchant, and that's what makes me happier to-day than I was yesterday; but be assured, my dear, it was not because of your extravagance. It is because I was a weak, silly man; now dry up your tears-look at me. I have a more cheerful face than you have seen me wear for many a day."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes!" answered the wife, "you have been a changed man ever since last New Years; something happened then-you didn't fail because I had a new bonnet and dress then-that can't be. You don't know how I have grieved to see you so changed. I feared something I might have done, made you so, and I have prayed to know what it was, but I have not been informed-I dared not ask you-you looked so forbidding."</p> 
               <p>"Would that you <emph>could</emph> have said this three months ago-it would have saved me much trouble-we've both been very foolish. No, my dear, I have not failed because you had New-Year presents; but before that time we had been trying to live in as good style as richer and older people-we had too much fine company-too many carriages came to our house-they cost us a great deal of money, and they didn't stop at my store often enough; or if they did, the fine ladies didn't<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6124-00000118"/> buy enough to make up what it cost us to live in a style corresponding to their ideas: so my business affairs became embarrassed. I was afraid to tell you-I could not change my style of living without doing so, and I kept on becoming more and more embarrassed, and more and more miserable, till, finally, I was driven to desperation, and now I'm a broken merchant. I've given up every thing, and we must take a cheaper house, and let our rich <emph>friends</emph> cut our acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>With a burning kiss the wife assured her husband that his plan met her entire approbation, and he acknowledged how foolish he had been in not giving her his confidence when his troubles began.</p> 
               <p>"We'll turn over a new leaf," said he. "You'll never again think I'm richer than I am. Hereafter I'll know what my income is, and we'll live within it. Rich acquaintances, balls and concerts-costly suppers, or none of them-just as we can afford. I'm not the first man who's failed from the same causes. I have some friends yet, and I think I can rise again. Any how, I'd rather be a clerk than such a merchant as I have been."</p> 
               <p>"When must we move?" inquired the wife calmly.</p> 
                
               <p>"Next week," Mr. Farley answered, "if we can find such a house as we can afford."</p> 
               <p>The broken merchant had been settled in an humble home but a few months when New Year came again. He was well satisfied with his experiment of living according to his means, to suit himself, not other people-to gratify his own tastes consistently with his circumstances, not to please other people consistently with their extravagant notions.</p> 
               <p>On New Year's day Mrs. Farley received a plain gold ring, inside of which were engraved these words: "<emph>Our new leaf-pay as you go.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>The once broken merchant has found this a profitable motto. He is now able to pay as he goes, and, at the same time, make his wife a more costly New Year's gift than the dress and the bonnet which the money of the usurer bought.</p> 
               <p>To those who would turn over a new leaf on next New Year's day, I recommend the merchant's motto, <emph>Pay as you go;</emph> it will never allow duns to perplex nor bailiffs to harass you-compared with the man or woman who runs up bills at the grocery, the store or the bake-shop-or who indulges fancy in any particular, on credit-you will be most happily independent.</p>

               <head>BEING SOMEBODY.</head> 
               <p>HARRY BROWN was a spruce young man, who was brave when there was real danger, but who was a great coward when he came face to face with ridicule; a sneer was the keenest weapon that could be employed against him. Many a sensitive man has been ruined by this thing of evil, as, like a two-edged sword, it has been launched at him by wits and wags.</p> 
               <p>When Harry began to go out from home among parties of young men and women, wine was often offered him. In principle he was a teetotaler, because he had regard for his mother's counsels and admonitions. He never even put the tempting cup to his lips, unless to evade a shaft from some quiver, the arrows of which were barbed with satire.</p> 
               <p>Harry knew that many of his companions were often inebriated; but it was fashionable to sip "rosy wine," and being an exception in the right, he could not turn, to general account, a keen stroke of wit against the wrong, though it were at his tongue's end, for fear of a rebut which might cut him sorely.</p> 
               <p>When about eighteen years of age, he was the companion of a dark-eyed beauty at a wedding party. Wine flowed freely, and the dance went on till past "the witching hour of night."</p> 
               <p>A companion, whom Harry deeply respected, had been well warmed with wine. Harry had accompanied him to the drinking saloon, but with a firm determination to "taste not, touch not." His companion raised a bumper and turned it off, with the taunting exclamation:</p> 
               <p>"Come, Harry; you've been a coward all your life. Now take a social glass with me, and be somebody, like other folks-only once, Harry."</p> 
               <p>As he spoke, he handed Harry a wine-glass overflowing. With a mad impulse Harry drained it.</p> 
               <p>His evil guide grasped his hand and cried: "I knew you'd be somebody yet! I always said you were not the coward some folks have taken you to be."</p> 
               <p>Again and again Harry drank with him, who congratulated him upon his bravery; and again and again he must exhibit it, by drinking with<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6124-00000120"/> other friends. His blood soon boiled in his veins, and his brain was on fire. He rushed from the drinking saloon into the open air, and seated himself in one of the carriages that stood in the brilliantly-lighted hotel yard. A crowd of bewildering thoughts occupied his mind; gradually he lost all sense of gravity; the lights in the hotel windows innumerably multiplied; some darted hither and thither, some swayed to and fro; the carriage in which he sat began to sway with an undulating, rolling motion; a dreadful sense of fear crept over him; faster and faster revolved the carriage among revolving lights, which threatened every instant to dash against him. He was seized with an indefinable agony, induced by a deep sense of overwhelming destruction; and, suddenly, with a dreadful shock, <emph>the ground rose perpendicularly before him.</emph> He was violently hurled from his seat, and his face was bruised and his clothes torn against the hard earth. A painful cry escaped him, and friends rushed to his rescue.</p> 
               <p>He was found flat on his face in the hotel yard, beside his own carriage.</p> 
               <p>In a few hours he awoke from heavy slumber, in the midst of bitter mortification, to ask if it was all a dream. The glances of his companions assured sured him that the tilt against his convictions had been real. He arose from his couch no longer a coward. He was panoplied with an armor powerful against the keen arrows he had before so much dreaded. That armor was sad experience; and he went forth behind it to battle against wrong, and so manfully did he labor, that he soon rescued a number of his companions from the martyrdom that threatened him, when his probation of cowardice was so violently consummated.</p> 
               <p>The lesson Harry Brown's experience teaches is, that with firm convictions of right, we should never fear the sneers, nor dread the wit of those who woo the wrong; most especially, when we are convinced that they "know the right, and yet the wrong pursue," as is the fact in regard to a large majority of men who become tipplers, even when tippling is most common.</p>

               <head>LITTLE FIBS.</head> 
               <p>A MOTHER sat with her youngest daughter, a sprightly child five years of age, enjoying an after-dinner chit-chat with a few friends, when a little girl, a playmate of the daughter of Mrs. P., came running into the sitting-room, and cried,</p> 
               <p>"Where is Jane? I've got something for her."</p> 
               <p>"She is out," said the mother.</p> 
               <p>"What have you got? Show it to me!" eagerly exclaimed Hannah, the mother's favorite. "I'll give it to her."</p> 
               <p>The little girl handed Hannah a bouquet of flowers, which she had gathered for Jane, and returned home with the faith that her kindness had not been misapplied. She had scarcely left the room, when Hannah, standing by her mother's chair, talking to herself, said, loud enough to be heard across the room,</p> 
               <p>"I like flowers-she often calls me Jane-she thinks I am Jane-I'm going to keep this bouquet."</p> 
               <p>The mother made no objection to this soliloquy, and Hannah immediately began to pick the leaves from a handsome rose, for the purpose of making rose-water. She had not completed her task when Jane bounded into the room, and seeing Hannah with flowers, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"I'm going to have a bouquet pretty soon. Sally Johnson said she would bring me one this afternoon."</p> 
               <p>"But she won't," said Hannah.</p> 
               <p>"I'll go and see," returned Jane, tripping, as she spoke, toward the front door.</p> 
               <p>"Here, Jane," said the mother, "Sally brought this bouquet for you, but you were not in, and she gave it to Hannah."</p> 
               <p>The tears started in Jane's eyes. She felt that she had been robbed, and she knew that Hannah had been preferred to her. Hannah had been encouraged in a deliberate falsehood, and in a deception towards her sister. Many a time since has that mother felt herself obliged to punish her daughter for prevarication; and often has she been heard to say that she wondered where so small a child learned so much deceit.</p> 
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6124-00000122"/>

               <head>THE PRETTY APPLE-GIRL.</head> 
               <p>SOME years ago, when I was a rambler through the streets of Cincinnati, for the purpose of picking up trifles to interest the readers of the local column of a city paper, I often purchased apples, nuts, and candies, of a young girl who had a stand near the junction of two business avenues.</p> 
               <p>She was not handsome, in the common acceptation of this much abused word, but there was an artlessness, and yet a winning grace, in her manner, which convinced me that her station in life <emph>should</emph> be above the one she then occupied. She wore, invariably, a close-fitting pink calico dress. I felt that her parents must be very poor; and, as I saw her day after day in the same attire, I had my suspicions that her wardrobe could not be very extensive; yet, as she always appeared scrupulously neat and tidy, it was a great mystery to me how this striking neatness was secured, and why there was never any variety in her apparel. I saw that<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6124-00000123"/> it was tasteful and becoming, but I knew that ladies are proverbial for a love of variety in dress, and I had an interest in knowing why this simple girl was so marked an exception.</p> 
               <p>I have always delighted to study character, either in high or low life, and I took it upon me to investigate the pretty apple-girl's peculiarity. Her fruit was ever clean and tempting, but I often made purchases merely for the sake of forming an acquaintance. At length, known to her as a liberal patron, she began to have less reserve with me than when first I noticed her, and finally I was emboldened to make inquiries in reference to her family. It was sometime before she conversed freely, but, by dint of perseverance, I learned that she lived with her mother, in a pleasant cottage on a quiet street in the suburbs of the city. I knew the spot-its attractiveness had often interested me, and I now became more curious than ever to hear the history of the apple-girl in the pink calico dress.</p> 
               <p>I ventured to ask permission to call on her mother, and make her acquaintance, under the plea of a love for birds and flowers, with both of which the cottage was surrounded. I did not receive the encouragement I wished, but still was left to hope that my curiosity might some day be gratified. As obstacles to my purpose increased I became more determined, and I resolved to change my tactics. I could not understand the girl's disinclination to allow our acquaintance to become, in any respect, familiar, but I knew that she would not dare to treat me rudely, and, watching my opportunity, one Sunday morning I addressed her, as she stood at the street-gate of the cottage, and, as I admired some flowers which grew in a bed near the house, she could not escape, politely, from the necessity of inviting me to walk through the yard. Accidentally we met the mother. I had an invitation to enter the cottage; of course I accepted with pleasure, and, finding the mother inclined to be more communicative than the daughter, I managed to learn that they were French folks, although both spoke English remarkably well. The cottage parlor was furnished plainly, but elegantly. There were upon the walls several pictures, and upon the mantel a number of delicate works of art, which I was satisfied could not have been purchased by the limited earnings of an apple-girl.</p> 
               <p>Why a young girl, who lived in such a cottage, with so much evident taste and cultivation, should<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6124-00000124"/> invariably wear a pink calico dress, and sell fruits, nuts and candies on the street, was to me a perplexing mystery. There was a web of romance weaving around the mysterious apple-girl which became more and more interesting, and every day my resolution to unravel it grew stronger. There was so much modesty in the girl's bearing at her apple-stand-she seemed so much afraid of scandal, should any one converse with her longer than was necessary to make purchases, that there was no way left for me to solve the mystery of her life but by visiting the cottage. Again I went, without an invitation, and boldly made known the curiosity which led me to force myself upon their acquaintance.</p> 
               <p>The daughter laughed heartily, and said gaily-</p> 
               <p>"We have been as much at fault to understand your curiosity as you have to reconcile our circumstances with my employment."</p> 
               <p>"Then we should be mutual confidants," I observed; "I have been very frank with you, and I hope you will reciprocate."</p> 
               <p>"But our relations are not similar," she replied, archly. "We are not responsible for your curiosity, and you are for ours."</p> 
               <p>"How so?" I cried.</p> 
                
               <p>"It was forced upon us."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed; and was not mine forced upon me, in such a manner, too, as left me no choice but to seek out the mystery? A truce to this bandying of words; you will not take advantage of my frankness for any other purpose than to reward it with full explanations."</p> 
               <p>She looked at me a moment, as if questioning my apparent honesty, and then said, pleasantly-</p> 
               <p>"Well, as you have been so good a patron of my apple-stand, and have taken such pains to know the romance of my history, if you will promise secresy, I'll tell you."</p> 
               <p>"I'll accept any conditions that I can fulfil," I answered, eagerly.</p> 
               <p>"Walk with me into the garden, then," said the girl.</p> 
               <p>We had a pleasant seat under a rustic arbor, when the lady remarked-</p> 
               <p>"Mother told you that we once lived in a village near Paris?"</p> 
               <p>"She did," I answered, "on my first visit."</p> 
               <p>"We were not rich, but we had a pretty cottage, and an income sufficient to support us. Father died when I was a little girl. I had no brothers, but I had a playmate who was dearer to<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6124-00000125"/> me than a brother. As we grew older, his parents, who were rich, forbade him to visit our house. We met in the fields. We loved each other, and would not be separated. His father learned that we still met, and he was very angry. He told his son that if he visited me he could not stay at his home. Our fathers had been bitter enemies, but we could not understand why that should make us enemies when we loved each other; and Emile declared that he would not neglect me, if his father did shut his doors against him. One day he said to me, 'I am going to run away, but not from you-from father, and you shall come to me, and then we shall never be parted again.' It was hard for me to consent, but Emile insisted, and we took leave of each other, and he did run away. It was a long time before we heard from him-then we got a letter, which told us that he was in America. I had changed very much since Emile's absence, and mother was afraid I would die; I coaxed her to take me to America; Emile told us in his letter that he lived in Cincinnati. When we arrived at Boston we inquired for Cincinnati, and were directed to this place. Mother bought this cottage, and here we have lived, expecting to meet Emile."</p> 
                
               <p>"Have you never heard from him?" I inquired.</p> 
               <p>"Only once," she answered.</p> 
               <p>"Do you know where he is now?"</p> 
               <p>"No indeed, if we did, we would not stay here long."</p> 
               <p>"Have you never written him?"</p> 
               <p>"We do not know his name. He has changed it, as he told us in his letter, but he neglected to tell us what name he now bears."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think you will ever find him?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed, I do. I dream about him every night. I know he is not dead, and I shall soon meet him."</p> 
               <p>"What makes you so confident, that you shall find him?"</p> 
               <p>I made this inquiry, hoping it might lead to some explanation of the pink dress, and apple-selling mystery. She understood my look and tone of curiosity, and answered pleasantly:</p> 
               <p>"That will explain to you the romance of my dress and occupation. When Emile and I played together in France, I often wore a dress very much like this one. If he should see me anywhere in this dress, he would know me. I might see him and not know him, but he would recognize<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6124-00000126"/> nize me, and I would not dress in any other style, for fear we might miss each other."</p> 
               <p>"But why sell apples in the street," said I with a look of admiration for her devotion, which she could not mistake. "There is certainly no necessity, that you should be so occupied."</p> 
               <p>"Yes there is," she answered naively, "I must be where Emile could see me, if he were to visit this city. I dare not be on the street all the time, unless I am occupied, and I never thought there was any disgrace in selling apples."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not," I exclaimed, "but all who know your history will honor you. Accept my sincerest wishes, that your devotion to the lover of your youth, may be fully rewarded by an early meeting and a happy reunion."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you-thank you-but he is my lover now, as much as he was when we were in France, and I know I am going to see him soon. I'll show him to you here before winter, I know I will. Mother says I am foolish, but something tells me to hope, and I do hope."</p> 
               <p>"May you not be disappointed," I said almost involuntarily.</p> 
               <p>A few days after this interview, I missed the apple-girl in the pink dress, from her accustomed stand. Fearing that she might be sick, I resolved to call at the cottage in the evening. When I went to the boarding-house at supper-time, a note was handed to me. It contained these words:</p>

               <p>In her pink dress at the apple stand she had met Emile the day previous.</p> 
               <p>I stood that night as a witness to their union, and a happier wedding I never attended. The devotion of the simple-hearted girl was rewarded-her faith was not misplaced-her homely talisman proved a true one.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>ON a damp, and of course dreary day, in early winter, some years since, a gentleman and a lady entered a stage-coach, at a little town on one of the principal highways leading to the capital of a Western State.</p> 
                  <p>The gentleman was a tall, rather portly, middle-aged man, who seemed to wear about him an air of authority, which betokened him an individual of some consequence, at least in his own estimation. He wore an ample cloak, which he wrapped about him with dignity as he seated himself on the front seat, and complacently regarded his companion who occupied the back seat.</p> 
                  <p>The lady might have been thirty-five years of age-she did not appear to be over twenty-five-her complexion was fair-her eyes sparkling-her hair dark and inclined to curl without the aid of a hair-dresser-the expression of her mouth was winning, and her teeth were perfect. She had the appearance of a woman of general information-one who had seen much of the world, and had moved in good society.</p> 
                  <p>This gentleman and this lady were the only passengers in this stage-coach. At the present day there is a railroad along the route between the towns to and from which this stage-coach conveyed passengers at the date of our history-for it is veritable history-and many people travel over this railroad who would have no acquaintance with each other-but stage-coaches are modes of conveyance calculated to make strangers sociable, especially on a dreary day, when there are but two passengers, and they a gentleman and lady, fitted to interest each other in conversation.</p> 
                  <p>Some common-place remarks about the weather-the roads and the aspect of the country were ventured by the gentleman, to which the lady replied pleasantly. Her voice was musical-the gentleman was charmed with her manner, and soon the conversation became genial and cordial.</p> 
                  <p>"You are journeying to the capital, I presume," said the gentleman, who by this time should be christened, and we shall call him Mr. Stately.</p> 
                  <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6124-00000128"/> 
                  <p>"That is my determination," replied the lady, who shall, for a time, be known as Mrs. Rigg. "Are you on your way thither?"</p> 
                  <p>"I am, madam," returned the gentleman, "and am somewhat impatient to travel faster than this coach does over these roads, because I wish to be present at the assembling of the Legislature."</p> 
                  <p>"You are a member of that body, I presume?"</p> 
                  <p>"I have the honor, madam, to represent the C-- District in the Senate of our State," replied the Hon. Mr. Stately, in a manner which indicated that he was conscious of the importance of his position, and felt the weight of its responsibilities. Madame Rigg did not fail to perceive that he was somewhat proud of his official station, and, with a winning smile, she said,</p> 
                  <p>"I was impressed when you entered the coach, that I should find in you a companion to the capital, and one, too, who was a man of consequence there."</p> 
                  <p>The Hon. Mr. Stately bowed gracefully, and said, blandly-</p> 
                  <p>"You do me too much honor. May I not be permitted to say, that I am rejoiced to find one on this journey, that would otherwise be tedious, whose intelligence and beauty will make it plea sant, and whom I shall often meet during the session of the Legislature, as I have no doubt she is the wife of some honorable member, whom she goes to meet."</p> 
                  <p>"My frankness has made you partial," returned the lady, as a deep blush mounted to her cheek. "I am but a poor widow, who has resided in the south several years. I do not design to stop at the capital more than a day, but shall pass on to visit some of my relatives, whom I have not seen since the death of my husband."</p> 
                  <p>"That has been several years," said the Hon. Mr. Stately, in a sympathizing tone.</p> 
                  <p>"About five," answered the widow.</p> 
                  <p>"And I have been a widower about the same time," returned the Hon. Mr. Stately.</p> 
                  <p>The coach stopped. It had arrived at a hotel where dinner was to be served. The Hon. Mr. Stately attended Madame Rigg to the parlor in his most gallant manner. They understood each other-they sympathized with each other-their sympathies rendered them cordial friends on a short acquaintance.</p> 
                  <p>The Hon Mr. Stately thought widow Rigg the most charming woman he had ever met. He was determined to know more of her history. How it<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6124-00000129"/> would astonish some of his friends at the Capital, should he appear among them with a bride-he who had been a widower nearly five years, and who had declared that no woman could again lure him into the marriage state-a declaration not very flattering to the memory of his deceased wife, but often made notwithstanding.</p> 
                  <p>Between dinner and supper time, the Hon. Mr. Stately learned that the widow Rigg had been residing on her plantation in Louisiana, near New Orleans, since the death of her husband-that she was childless, and had no intention of ever again acknowledging the marriage relation under the blessing of a minister of the gospel.</p> 
                  <p>This declaration, though careless and apparently firmly made, did not, in the least, dampen the eagerness of Hon. Mr. Stately, to render the widow every polite attention in his power. On the contrary, it seemed that his attentions were more marked than they had previously been. The widow began to suspect that he must be smitten with her charms, and she fancied that he had a design upon her independence. She was not as frank with him as she had been-she became reserved.</p> 
                  <p>We need not follow the history of the Hon. Mr. Stately's attentions to widow Rigg. Every hour he became more obsequious and earnest in his addresses, and on the evening of the second day of the journey, when he met the widow alone in the parlor of a hotel, he made a formal declaration of his love, which was-accepted.</p> 
                  <p>The Hon. Mr. and Mrs. Stately did not travel by stage-coach. A private conveyance was procured, and somewhat of the Senator's haste to be present at the organization of the Legislature, abated-still he was anxious to present his charming bride to his friends at the Capital, as soon as was consistent with the dignity of travel.</p> 
                  <p>On the day after the formal declaration, to which we have alluded, was solemnly ratified, the following appeared in the newspaper of the village where the ceremony was performed:</p> 
                  <q>
                     <p>"MARRIED.-In this town, on the evening of the - inst., Hon. Mr. STATELY, Senator from --, to Mrs. AMELIA RIGG, formerly of Louisiana."</p>
                     <p>"The happy couple are on their way to the Capital. Their liberal remembrance of the Printer, entitles them to his best wishes."</p>
                  </q> 
                  <p>Immediately beneath this notice was another:</p> 
                  <q>
                     <p>"MARRIED.-In this town, on the evening of the - inst., Major W. B. BLOW, of the Capital, and Miss MARY CONSTANT, of this village-only daughter of Rev. Caleb Constant."</p>
                  </q>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                  <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6124-00000130"/> 
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>THE Legislature organized without the presence of the Hon. Mr. Stately. He arrived at the Capital on the evening of the day of the organization. The news of his marriage reached the city before him-the congratulations he received from the members generally were polite, but by some of his bachelor friends, to whom he had often deprecated matrimony, he was given a reception which, though cordial, was by no means satisfactory. Instead of congratulating him, they took occasion to make him a butt for jest and ridicule. He took this with as good a grace as possible, saying:</p> 
                  <p>"Come, come, my fine fellows; meet me at Judge Drift's party, this evening. I'll present you my bride. You will say it is no wonder he was caught. If you don't, I'll give you license to laugh at me as much as you please."</p> 
                  <p>This was to be the opening soiree of the season, and every body knew it would be a grand affair. Every body wanted to be there, but every body was not invited. It was a select party of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> and the distinguished.</p> 
                   
                  <p>The ladies of the Capital were impatient to meet the bride of the Hon. Mr. Stately, Senator from -- District. A number called at her hotel; she was indisposed, and could not see company. It was doubtful whether she would be able to attend the party. She was an artist. She reserved her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entree</foreign> into the society of the Capital until an hour when she could make such an impression as became the bride of the Hon. Mr. Stately, Senator.</p> 
                  <p>The hour for the assembling of the brilliant company at the splendidly decorated parlors of the wealthy Judge Drift arrived. Costly carriages stood at the front door; rich silks rustled in the hall, and "brave men and fair women" saluted each other, while the soft light of resplendent chandeliers was reflected from flashing jewelry, and shone upon finest broadcloths.</p> 
                  <p>The Hon. Mr. Stately's bride was the universal theme of conversation. Every body wanted to know if anybody had seen her-if anybody could tell how handsome or how rich she was. Common rumor said she was very handsome and very rich, but nobody knew how common rumor learned these interesting facts.</p> 
                  <p>It was a late hour for the reception of even the most exquisitely fashionable, and yet the Hon.<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6124-00000131"/> Mr. Stately and his bride had not appeared. Curiosity was on tip-toe, and many feared that the lady's indisposition would, indeed, prevent her attendance. The party would be of no account without her-a splendid failure would it be, unless the bride of the Hon. Mr. Stately honored it with her presence.</p> 
                  <p>At length, when regrets were passing from mouth to mouth, a carriage was heard. It stopped at the door of Judge Drift, and the Hon. Mr. Stately and lady were announced.</p> 
                  <p>She entered the parlor with the air of a Queen. The hostess was struck with her rich and tasteful dress, her commanding person, and graceful manners. The Hon. Mr. Stately was the proudest and happiest of men. He regarded some of his acquaintances, who had rallied him on a change of sentiment in regard to matrimony, in a manner which plainly said-</p> 
                  <p>"Did I not tell you I had good reason? Acknowledge that you would have been caught as well as I-confess that you are well nigh struck dumb with astonishment."</p> 
                  <p>When the Hon. Mrs. Stately was seated upon a sofa, bearing the scrutiny of all eyes, as if she had been accustomed to trying situations in distinguished guished society, the ladies stole glances one at the other, to see who was attired in a style similar to that which enhanced the graces of her who was the "observed of all observers." Those whose taste had led them nearest the selection the Hon. Mrs. Stately had made, were the objects of peculiar envy.</p> 
                  <p>The Hon. Mr. Stately presented his friends as opportunity offered. They were all received with bewitching grace, and all were charmed-none wondered that the Honorable gentleman had again "intrusted his happiness to the caprice of a woman," as one of his fellow-legislators remarked.</p> 
                  <p>At the opposite end of the parlor, in which the Hon. Mrs. Stately charmed a circle, were several distinguished individuals who had not been honored with a presentation. The Hon. Mr. Stately selected one for especial introduction to his bride. He was known as Mr. Bragg-an incorrigible bachelor, a votary of "fashion," and a gamester, but a man who was received in the first circles of the Capital, because he was a brilliant conversationalist, and commanded immense wealth.</p> 
                  <p>The Hon. Mr. Stately, with a haughty step, led this "gentleman" toward his bride. He anticipated a triumph. He had been severely satirized<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6124-00000132"/> by this leader of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ton,</foreign> and now he would punish him. He was obsequious-ironically obsequious-in the ceremony of the presentation.</p> 
                  <p>To his amazement, his bride blushed and averted her head when her eyes met those of this "gentleman," who turned upon his heel and strutted contemptuously across the parlors.</p> 
                  <p>All the company were shocked-there must be some great misapprehension, or a distressing <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> was to be made. A group gathered around the votary of fashion, who had turned in scorn from the Hon. Mrs. Stately-and soon cabilistic whispers were passed among the gossip-loving fashionables. Ladies who had been most officious in their attendance upon the bride, now shrunk from her.</p> 
                  <p>A dark cloud had gathered over the Hon. Mr. Stately's bright future. He was about to seek him who had so grossly insulted his bride, and demand an explanation, when the lady haughtily desired to be escorted from a place where she was not secure from insult.</p> 
                  <p>Sadly and silently did the Hon. Mr. Stately retire from a company where his bride was to have been the centre of attraction, but where she had become an object of scorn and contempt. He asked no explanation of her. He would demand satisfaction of the villain, who had so inexplicably insulted him. He would yet triumph over his hate-for such the Hon. Mr. Stately suspected to be the motive of his base conduct. He parted with his bride at the door of their apartments, to wreak vengeance upon him who had converted an hour of exhilarating joy and proud triumph into one of maddening perplexity and bitterest anger.</p> 
                  <p>No sooner had the Hon. Mr. Stately and lady retired from Judge Drift's parlors, than the cause of Mr. Bragg's contemptuous treatment of the bride was boldly spoken among both men and women. The hostess declared herself most grossly insulted.</p> 
                  <p>A bride, who was a stranger in the capital, heard this remark, and she said-</p> 
                  <p>"Pray, explain to me this singular affair!"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't <emph>you</emph> know who she is?" exclaimed Madame Drift.</p> 
                  <p>"Indeed, it is all a mystery to me," answered the bride of Major Blow.</p> 
                  <p>"Your husband will tell you," replied Madame D.; "I cannot. How impudent to come to my house-to deceive so distinguished a man as the Hon. Mr. Stately. I never heard anything so<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6124-00000133"/> outrageous. Why didn't your husband expose her at first?"</p> 
                  <p>"My husband expose her," cried the bride of Major Blow. "What can you mean?"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't you know?" exclaimed a richly-dressed, but coarse woman, who at this moment came within hearing of the conversation between the hostess and Major B.'s bride. "La me, it's queer you don't know. Hain't anybody told you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Told me what? I do not understand. Pray, relieve my suspense, I beseech you," cried Mrs. Blow, looking wildly around her.</p> 
                  <p>"Why, it's funny nobody let you in the secret," answered the coarse woman, Mrs. Take, a land-speculator's wife. "I'd tell you, but you'd feel hard about it That creature married Hon. Mr. Stately as a rich widow. But, wasn't that a trick?-then come to the Capital, where she might have known she'd be found out. What ails the woman?"</p> 
                  <p>The bride of Major Blow had instinctively divined what her newly-found "delicate acquaintance" so "delicately" hinted. When Mrs. Take exclaimed, "<emph>What ails the woman?</emph>" she stood pale and immovable-her eyes fixed upon vacancy-the expression of her countenance a picture of absolute solute despair. In a moment she tottered, and would have fallen heavily, had not Major Blow sprung to her side and supported her-she was borne from the parlor unconscious. As Major B. retired, supporting his wife, he heard Mrs. Take say-</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't think she'd take it that way, or I wouldn't have hinted so plainly."</p> 
                  <p>A group had gathered around Madame Take, and a Mrs. Marr, a portly woman, who had several darling daughters, replied-</p> 
                  <p>"Why, don't you know the Major's wife's a country preacher's daughter? She hain't seen much society, you might know. Thank Heaven, my girls have been better raised than that. They've been taught that young men should know the world."</p> 
                  <p>"I confess there is sense in some women after all," said an intimate friend of Bragg's, to himself, as he accidentally overheard these remarks, which were intended only for female ears.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter">

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <p>WE need scarcely say, that when the Hon. Mr. Stately met the fashionable Mr. Bragg, and learned why he had turned in scorn from his bride, he had no vengeance to wreak upon him. He was an abused, disappointed man, whom every body pitied. On the morrow, by a special act of the legislature, he was divorced. He never saw the widow, Amelia Rigg, again. Whether she continued on her journey, or returned to her plantation in Louisiana, the people of the capital could not tell, but a few of Major Blow's most intimate friends knew that she did not leave the city, until she had an opportunity to write him-</p> 
                  <p>"My vengeance for your desertion of me has been partially taken, quite unexpectedly to me, but none the less bitterly to you-the rest will come when you are least aware, and then you will ruin no more women. May you have joy with your bride."</p> 
                  <p>What of this bride? She was not a woman of commanding or fascinating appearance, but a woman of a sound mind and correct principles.</p> 
                  <p>When she had been restored to consciousness, in the handsome mansion she had left an hour previous, as a home, but which could never be a home to her again, she gave vent to a paroxysm of grief, which told that her heart bled deeply. Major Blow would have consoled his bride with protestations of constancy, but she looked at him through bitterest tears, and said-</p> 
                  <p>"You came to my father's house, and found me an innocent girl. I thought you loved me with a heart that had never been another's-so you told me. It was false. The Hon. Mrs. Stately, whom we saw to-night, has a claim upon you I would not share. How she was spurned!-and I was spurned too, but nobody spurned you. Mr. Stately will desert his base wife. To-morrow <emph>your</emph> home will be without a mistress; I shall go home to my father's, and die of a broken heart. I thought I had married a man worthy of my love-he has been a seducer; he can no longer have my confidence; we <emph>must</emph> part. Oh, God, you seemed to me a man of honor, but it was a deceitful seeming. From my father's house, where I was taught that virtue is a cardinal requisite to respectability, at<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6124-00000135"/> all eras of a man's or a woman's life, I was lured into associations which require me to acknowledge that I have given my love and confidence to one who should long ago have atoned, as far as lay in his power, for deepest injury to a woman who, this night, took her revenge upon society in a manner which makes homeless the deceived wife of her destroyer. He is not injured-he will move, as he always has done freely, among those who will turn in scorn from his companion in vice. His acquaintances would point to me as the successor of her whose shame they jest about. I did not leave my father's fireside to fill such a place. I came not from honest, though poor friends, to mingle with the rich and gay, but vulgar and unprincipled, who, were they poor, as my father is, would be, as they ought to be, outcasts from society. I left the home of my girlhood a hopeful bride; I will return to it a broken-hearted woman. My father is an old man; I will soon meet him, where mother now is, in heaven.</p> 
                  <p>"It will be vain to plead with me; my purpose is firm. I choose an early death to a lingering life of self-conscious shame. Oh, God! that one so trustful should be so basely wronged, and that for resentment of that wrong, because it has been the custom to wink at depravity among those who can procure men's good opinions, she may be condemned by the very men and women, who should scorn the man that dared to abuse her confidence, and deprive her of life's sweetest joys."</p> 
                  <p>The injured woman had talked calmly for one in her peculiar position, but a bitterness with which she spoke, had no slight influence upon the wretch society called her husband, but who, in truth, was her murderer.</p> 
                  <p>In vain did Major Blow expostulate-in vain did he plead-in vain did he pledge his honor that he loved his wife and would be true to her. On the morrow she left his house, and returned to her father's.</p> 
                  <p>Every body was shocked that a debased woman should so grossly deceive an honorable gentleman like Mr. Stately, and every body sympathized with him. But a few only sympathized with the noble-hearted Mary Constant. The majority even of her own sex condemned her as a rash and inconsiderate woman, and some said complacently, "she ought to know that reformed rakes make the best husbands, and she ought to have believed the Major was reformed."</p> 
                  <p>Had she known his character when she married<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6124-00000136"/> him, there might have been some reason in a plea like this-but he had deceived her. With the conviction of that deception departed her confidence in his honor, and she was too high-minded and honest-hearted to abide as a wife with a man whom she could not respect.</p> 
                  <p>While his abused wife "pined in thought," and prayed for death, Major Blow was a <emph>gentleman</emph> in the social circles of the capital, and a man of consequence in the political world. Neither his heart-broken wife, nor the Hon. Mrs. Stately, were ever mentioned to his detriment, except by avowed and <emph>wicked</emph> enemies. When a space of time had elapsed sufficient to allow him to get a divorce, Major Blow led to the altar one of the dashing daughters of the very amiable and moral Madame Marr.</p> 
                  <p>We believe the Hon. Mr. Stately returned to his convictions, that matrimony was a dangerous experiment, but he rarely expressed his sentiments on the subject. His acquaintances laughed at him earnestly in private, but the joke was too severe a one to be referred to in public, by any one who had the slightest respect for his feelings.</p>

                  <p>OLIVE GREVILLE was a golden-haired girl, whose careless ringlets were tossing, and whose bright blue eyes were flashing, whenever and wherever there was mischief brewing among the school girls with whom she associated. She was a fascinating creature, ever in mischief, but never making enemies of those she played tricks upon, provided they could see her joyous face, or hear her silvery laugh, when the success of the trick was announced. She was the pride, and yet the pest of teachers; the envy, and yet the chosen friend<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6124-00000137"/> of playmates-and though much admired, appeared by the beaux to be generally thought a coquetish little sprite, who would not be tamed into marriageable womanhood on the sunny side of thirty-five.</p> 
                  <p>At the commencement of the winter quarter of school-not a select school in a city, nor the fashionable boarding-school of a retired village, but a plain country school, at which "<emph>large</emph>" boys and "<emph>large</emph>" girls could go no deeper into the wonders of science, than a hasty examination of Comstock's Philosophy and Chemistry-take a smattering of Algebra, and conjugate a few Latin nouns and verbs.-French-it was never thought of-Music-such alone was taught as belongs to the bird with its "wood-notes wild." At the opening of the winter session of this school there appeared with the teacher, from the academy of a neighboring town, a young man, whose bearing, dress, and conversation betokened that, with natural advantages, he had enjoyed all the opportunities for improvement to which his tastes inclined him. To attend this country school was a freak, because he happened to have a liking for his class-mate, who was to be the teacher, and he thought three months country school life would afford him instruction struction and pleasure. On the first day of school he was the subject of close scrutiny, and he endured it well, because he occupied himself with a general examination of his new schoolmates, especially on that side of the room where the young ladies conned over their lessons. Weeks passed and he made no acquaintances. There was no sign, that could be surely divined, which told who would be his favorite before the winter snows melted and the spring flowers blossomed. The school girls deemed themselves slighted, and devised "ways and means" for retaliation. It happened at a certain noon-time, that the <emph>taciturn</emph> young man sat at the end of a long bench near the stove, when Olive Greville occupied the opposite extremity. As scholar after scholar came in, she was crowded toward, what she deemed the bashful young fellow. High hopes were entertained by her that he would be "driven to the wall." Their proximity grew closer and closer; presently, the school boy and school girl were struggling to see who should have the contested seat, when, in duty bound, as a polite young man, the boy surrendered, but not without a forfeit. Suddenly rising, he again seated himself in a position where, with one arm around a fair neck, he<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6124-00000138"/> had a favorable opportunity to pay himself for the loss of his place from a pair of lips which were turned up scornfully. The eyes which flashed above those lips were a-glow for a moment, and then Olive's ringing laugh rose above that which her companions indulged at her expense. Olive Greville and William Heminge were from that hour intimate friends.</p> 
                  <p>We might weary the reader with a lengthy chapter of mischief-makings, of love adventures, of crosses and disappointments, which happened before the last day of school; but in the general language of confessed inability, or indisposition, they are "better imagined than described." The last day came with its partings, and there were wet eyes and sad hearts, but Heminge not being impatient of departure, had neither, having resolved to postpone his return to a distant home, until he had recreated among the wild flowers which had begun to blossom. Every day he was out on the hills, through the meadows and amid the forests, in search of pleasure; but it was found nowhere so truly, as when, on a moonlight evening, he sat upon an old bench near the Greville homestead, and with Olive by his side, talked of the future and the prospects which brightened in it.</p> 
                  <p>They had strange converse one evening for boys and girls. After a period of thoughtful silence, Olive suddenly turned her face up, and looking William boldly in his dark eyes, abruptly exclaimed, as if forgetful of his presence:</p> 
                  <p>"He will never marry me, I know he will not; to-morrow we part; it will be our last parting." Then suddenly recollecting herself but not changing her eyes' expression, she said-"You know my heart, I have abstractedly spoken out its honest feelings, but I care not for conventionalities and am glad the burden is off."</p> 
                  <p>"Presentiments are not always to be slightly heeded," was the cold reply to Olive's ardent confession.</p> 
                  <p>Then the expression of that blue eye changed, it grew darker, and as it fell without wavering on the lover's face, the girl exclaimed:-</p> 
                  <p>"I am deceived, and yet I divined aright. William, we must part-let it be now-we will dismiss the school fancies of the past winter, and have lighter hearts as the summer grows. I am equal to the task."</p> 
                  <p>As she spoke, she rose from her seat, and William<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6124-00000139"/> liam had not time to collect his scattered thoughts before the door of her father's cottage closed behind her. He offered not to follow her, but bent his steps homeward, revealing his thoughts only in the expression, "I'll write to her to-morrow, before I leave, and all will be right."</p> 
                  <p>On the morrow, Olive showed no evidence of grief, and talked of William's departure with the family, as if it were a matter in which she had no other than a common interest. Yet her thoughts were busy, and she felt that though her heart strings might break, he should not know but that she had resigned herself to <emph>Presentiments.</emph>
                  </p> 
                  <p>"But," she reflected; "with change of time, other changes may come. I shall see him, when I am not a giddy romping girl."</p> 
                  <p>About noon she received the following note in a pretty envelope. It was hastily read:</p>

                  <p>The rejected girl did not crumple this letter angrily; she retired to her room and soliloquized:</p>

I was won too easily, but I cannot be deceptive, and before I spoke I felt that he knew my sentiments. I have learned a lesson. I shall be wary hereafter. He says 'forget' before 'forgive.'

                  <p>FIVE years elapsed-with change of time other changes <emph>had</emph> come. William Heminge was one of a gay party assembled in the brilliant drawing rooms of a fashionable mansion, where dwelt one of the wealthiest families of an eastern city. The occasion was the welcome of a niece of the owner of this mansion, who was to make her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">debut</foreign> in city society. She moved among the throng with universal admiration. A commanding person and queenly carriage made amends for what her features lacked in regular symmetry, but no one studied their varied and always eloquent expression-no one caught the sparkle of her deep blue eye; sometimes, when illumined in conversation, possessing a cerulean-like depth-no one saw her dark auburn ringlets falling carelessly over a graceful neck and finely moulded shoulders, who did not acknowledge himself in superior presence. William Heminge, who, since his country school-boy experience, had been seeking to find the apposite of her whom he had then rudely cast off, gained an immediate introduction, and by the side of his old friend's lovely niece was he ever found, when she was unengaged. Her conversation was spirited and independent-he admired the force of her expressions and the boldness of her opinions. He went to his hotel that night, determined to know more of Alice Brome. He called at the uncle's and found the niece apparently glad to see him. She was quite frank. He was a visitor upon the recommendation of a friend (her uncle) of long standing. Her manner was unreserved, and when he took his leave, she begged he would not stand upon ceremony, but excuse her for inviting him to take advantage of his privilege as an old favorite of her uncle.</p> 
                  <p>Around him closed the charm, under whose influence he had fallen until its sway was resistless. Taking hat and cane he, one afternoon, walked up to the house of Mr. Brome, determined to know whether he had found such favor in the eyes of his niece as he had sometimes been led to hope. He found her at the piano, and at his request she<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6124-00000141"/> performed a number of airs, one of which, as he remarked, reminded him of a song a lovely girl once sung to him, when attending a country school. Alice sung it a second time to please him, and, falling into a train of old memories, he related to her a "love adventure," which then "disturbed his mind," dwelling upon the ardent, innocent devotion of one whom he had regarded only as a playmate, but who, in their last interview, had revealed a depth of affection which he could not reciprocate, though he had unconsciously led her into the maze.</p> 
                  <p>"And did you leave her thus?" was the pointed question of his listener.</p> 
                  <p>"I did, but her memory has been ever present with me, and I have regretted the parting only because I could not go back and claim her for my bride, take her to my proud home, and show those who have smiled at my school-boy fancy what that fancy was for."</p> 
                  <p>And why have you not done so?"</p> 
                  <p>"I know not where to find her. She was removed from her home, and her parting injunction to her mother was, that if I inquired I was not to know her destination."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you not know now?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I do not. I gave up the search in despair, and I presume she is now the wife of one who did not coldly reject the proffer of her love. But I have had another search, well nigh as fruitless. I have sought for one who, in womanhood, approached that which I have pictured Olive Greville to be. At length fortune has favored me. Chance threw that one in my path"-and, looking Alice in the face, he took her hand-"my heart and fortune are at her command."</p> 
                  <p>A pallor overspread her face, then the warm blood rushed to her cheeks, and mantled in her forehead; she offered not to take away her hand for a moment, but returned his deep look, then rising, bowed, as if to withdraw, but Heminge detained her. "You shall not detain me, sir," she scornfully exclaimed, "I must speak to my uncle."</p> 
                  <p>"Not until you have given me an answer, or bid me hope," said Heminge, stepping to the door.</p> 
                  <p>"You will remain <emph>there</emph> a long time then, sir; I <emph>must</emph> speak to my uncle." Alice rang for a servant, who entered the parlor immediately. She bid him tell Mr. Brome that Mr. Heminge wished to see him, and then left the room.</p> 
                  <p>In a moment Heminge heard the uncle in the enjoyment of a hearty laugh, and, presuming it was<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6124-00000142"/> at his expense, was about to rush from the house, when the gentleman met him, with the exclamation-</p> 
                  <p>"A pretty state of affairs-proposed to my niece, eh? Pshaw! we'll have to let <emph>you</emph> into the secret."</p> 
                  <p>"Secret," ejaculated Heminge, "what secret, pray?"</p> 
                  <p>"A capital joke, but keep cool-proposed to Alice-a young man who ranks among the millionaires. My niece? Heminge, you are a victim-she's no niece of mine-a good joke. I saw her in the country-visited at her father's, took a fancy to her, had her educated-introduced her to society as my niece-I'd leave her all my property, but you know there are little Bromes enough of another family, and they're not over rich either. The girl is poor when she marries; can have nothing but the dower I choose to confer. Would you propose now, Heminge?"</p> 
                  <p>"With all my heart. Where is Alice?"</p> 
                  <p>"Stop, did she say she would accept you? I rather think not. You'll have to do your courting over again. But sit down; I will see if she is inclined to renew the conference."</p> 
                  <p>In a few moments the "uncle" led the "niece" into the parlor. She met Heminge's searching glance, and was the first to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Heminge, I cannot now reply as you could wish to the proposal with which you have honored me. I have ever treated you as the friend of him who has been to me more than a father. You now understand our relations. We understand each other. If, after three months have elapsed, you choose to renew the conversation of to-day, I can give you a definite answer. I bid you good evening."</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Heminge was left with the "uncle." He took his hat, and was soon "homeward bound," in deep meditation. He did not understand-he was chagrined-inclined to be out of humor-but when he thought of his ideal, and contrasted Alice-reflected upon her straight-forward independence, her accomplishments and graces, he determined quietly to "bide her time."</p>

                  <p>WILLIAM HEMINGE was the <emph>rumored</emph> husband of Alice Brome, in all the fashionable circles of their acquaintance, long before his three months' probation had expired. Their first meeting after the events of the preceding chapter was accidental, and they both, at first, were rather reserved, but soon her composure gave him confidence, and her easy manner brought them in communion. The proposal was never referred to, but not a day passed which did not make the reflection more painful to Heminge, that his probation might result in his disappointment.</p> 
                  <p>He walked one evening to the mansion of Mr. Brome-a flood of golden light fell from the setting sun, upon an open door-way, and he entered the house without ringing. The parlor door was open-he walked into the room-it was vacant. He proceeded towards a window, when his eye fell upon a small locket, which lay upon the edge of a marble-top stand. As he stepped near the treasure, he heard a light foot-fall behind him. He intuitively picked up the locket, and with a mischievous smile turned his head, in time to hear Alice exclaim:</p> 
                  <p>"You will oblige me, Mr. Heminge, not to open that locket. It contains a picture which I would not have <emph>you</emph> see."</p> 
                  <p>He held it over his head, and had not yet even looked fairly at it, but as Alice struggled to reach it, something about her manner excited his curiosity, and he drew the prize toward him with a glance which betrayed emotion-in a moment a glow overspread his face, his eyes expressed eloquent hopes, and he exclaimed:</p> 
                  <p>"You will excuse me, Miss Brome, but I have seen this locket before-and must open it."</p> 
                  <p>She could not prevent him, the case was unclasped-his own features were revealed in a souvenir which he had, some years previous, presented to Olive Greville.</p> 
                  <p>He cast upon Alice a glance which spoke deeply of wonder and inquiry, and he abruptly asked:</p> 
                  <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6124-00000144"/> 
                  <p>"Am I deceived-a suspicion breaks upon me. Are you Alice Brome or Olive Greville?"</p> 
                  <p>"Presentiments are not always to be slightly heeded, Mr. Heminge."</p> 
                  <p>"I am not deceived. You <emph>are</emph> Olive Greville, you are not merely <emph>like</emph> her whom I have hoped to meet for years, you not only answer the ideal, but you are the original of my hopes. You <emph>will be</emph> mine," he passionately exclaimed, and stepped forward to take her hand.</p> 
                  <p>Her form was elevated to its proudest height, and retreating a pace, she bent on him a stern gaze.</p> 
                  <p>"The probation is not expired, Mr. Heminge, but I will answer you. I have much to say, however, and cannot say it now. To-morrow, at this hour, your answer to this proposition will be ready. I bid you good afternoon." Olive immediately retired from the parlor, leaving Mr. Heminge in a very perplexing quandary.</p> 
                  <p>When he called at the mansion, at the appointed hour on the morrow, from this quandary the lover was relieved by the annexed note, which a servant handed him:</p>

                              <p>MR. HEMINGE:-Our position has been reversed since I had the honor of a note from you. I felt then it would, some day, be so, but could give no reason, unless it were the influence of <emph>presentiments.</emph> What I should do, were I at liberty to accept your proposal, I need not now declare, but when you first made it, I put you upon three months probation, because I did not wish to give you a direct refusal, nor did I then desire you to know that I was the betrothed of another. Before the time of that probation is expired I shall be the wife of Mr. Henry Dana, of Boston, Massachusetts.</p> 
                              <p>My regards for you would not allow me to reject your offer without explanations, and I choose <emph>now</emph> to tell you how it happens that you met me as Alice Brome. My father and mother are in the grave. Your search for me was fruitless, as you state, because my mother solemnly promised, that if you applied, you should not know my retreat, when, at Mr. Brome's request, I entered a boarding-school.</p> 
                              <p>I shall ever esteem you as a friend, who was dear to me in my youth, (I am not ashamed, even now, of the youthful impulse which betrayed me, you will perceive,) and hope I shall see you often at our house before I am taken to the home of my future husband. The deception played upon you<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6124-00000145"/> in my change of name ascribe to Mr. Brome's partiality, who declared I should not be his adopted niece without the name; but I think, for this, <emph>you</emph> will excuse him as well as your friend,</p>

               <head>MASTERLY IN ACTIVITY.</head> 
               <p>GENERALLY, those men are the happiest who are steadily and usefully occupied. Labor is not a curse but a blessing, though it may be, and is made a curse under a great variety of circumstances; idleness is the greater curse after all, because it is a parent of evil. Yet there are times when idleness-absolute idleness-has delicious enjoyment-it is perfect rest of both mind and body-a dreamy state of indolence, in which the cares of the world-the sorrows of the past and the hopes of the future are alike forgotten. To the poet, who, in the evening, when the shadows creep away slowly and die in the gathering darkness, lies by the brook, there is a state of "masterly inactivity" which makes him feel stronger as a poet and a man, though he cannot tell why.</p> 
               <p>The plodding farmer, as he goes home with his team, sees the poet, and wonders how, with malice aforethought, a sensible man can thus waste time; but did the farmer set himself down oftener, not<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6124-00000146"/> to dream like the poet, but to think like a man of business, he might find seasons of "masterly inactivity," which, in the lengthening out of his scope of reason, would pay him for his seeming idleness.</p> 
               <p>Life is real, but a share of its reality may be embodied in ease and quiet, which he who drives himself to incessant activity never finds. Our people are too "fast" for comfort, if not profit, in many ways, but then we are <emph>young,</emph> and "live and learn" is our motto.</p>

               <p>EBENEZER ELLIOTT, a poet of the people of England, wrote rough rhymes, but most of them breathe the eloquence of truth. He wrote much home truth, but never more pointedly than when he appeals for Homes of Taste. Who with him cannot fervently exclaim: <q>

               <p>The want of an attractive home, with congenial society, drives more men to the tavern and the groggery, or the billiard saloon, than inclination for strong drink or bad associations. The desire<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6124-00000147"/> for bacchanalian associations is in most instances only acquired after men are thrown among them, and the absence of home attractions leaves them free to seek company elsewhere. The dram-seller knows this, and wisely for his pocket (which he alone consults) is careful to provide easy chairs and a cheerful fire. The accommodation must not be indulged without some return to the landlord, and hence follows the social glass.</p> 
               <p>When our wives and mothers in humble, as well as in pretending circumstances, appreciate the home ties of taste, and adorn themselves and their children, and their households (be they ever so plain) accordingly, and those who make our laws consider practically that education is cheaper and better than punishment; that schools are better for the preservation of morals than prisons, and in a catholic spirit, give the people of our towns and cities parks, public baths, and free libraries, cheap lectures, and cheap music, we shall have more homes of taste in our land, grog-sellers will have reason to say their business is profitless-public morals will be improved, and public burdens will be lighter.</p> 
               <p>We pride ourselves upon the diffusion of knowledge in America, and we have good cause for this pride; but taking no step backward, those who perceive the moral influence of this diffusion should be advocates for general intelligence, until not only our people, but those of foreign lands who seek homes among us, are recipients of its advantages; then in place of the cheerless, uninviting home of sluttery, as Elliott describes it, we shall more frequently meet the home of taste, and find <q>

               <head>SUMMER LIFE.</head> 
               <p>THERE is sociability in Summer. The birds come to your door and sing-the winds play freely through your rooms, toss your hair, and turn over and bear away loose papers. Your doors are open, and you hear your neighbor's children cry, and you hear them laugh.</p> 
               <p>During a whole Winter you may not have known your neighbor when you met him on the street, but Summer comes-up go windows and open fly doors-you sit in your little yard, or on your door-step-your neighbor does the same-you talk about the weather or the news, and an acquaintance is formed; out of that acquaintance a friendship may spring which will gladden many a desolate hour.</p> 
               <p>You have never known whether the man who lives across the street was kind-hearted. Now you see his children run to meet him; you see him greet them with affection; you hear him bid his wife "good evening," or "good-bye." Perhaps he is going on a journey, and you know from the tone of his voice that he loves and is loved at home, and you respect him as you never did in winter, when you saw him, wrapped in his great coat, pass the front door, and go to the side entrance to his house.</p> 
               <p>Men and women may think more in winter than in summer-they may derive pleasure and instruction from "interior views" of selves and others-there may be close communion and fireside chat-home confidence in winter, which summer does not know; but men and women, as well as birds and flowers, as well as foliage and fruits, need genial sunshine, balmy airs, and refreshing showers-sunshine and airs, and showers which animate and revive outer life.</p> 
               <p>You go on a journey in winter; you shrink and shiver, and you don't want any body to talk to you; you wish you were at home, and you vow that when you get there you'll stay. In Summer every body takes trips into the country, whether any body makes long journeys or not. But many do make journeys to visit friends, and to see the fashions at watering places. When travelling, you see the leaves bowing to each other-one field<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6124-00000149"/> of wheat or corn waves towards another-the birds sing to each other-the cattle stand side by side in some cooling shade. You reflect-you see that nature is generous and bountiful-you rejoice in the influences which surround you-you surrender yourself to them and you are gay, glad, and generous, and you find that others are generous, gay, and glad.</p> 
               <p>How hard-hearted-how close-fisted men and women would become-how prematurely old children would grow, if summer did not come, it would be painful to calculate.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head> 
                  <p>"REBECCA! Rebecca!"</p> 
                  <p>These words were uttered by a man of middle age, as he stood in a verandah overlooking the handsome lawn of a plantation of considerable notoriety in one of the Southern States.</p> 
                  <p>The call was promptly responded to by a young girl, possessing, in a remarkable degree, those luxuriant beauties for which the better-classed Creoles of the South are famed.</p> 
                  <p>When she had joined her father he said, sternly-</p> 
                  <p>"Who was that, Rebecca, I saw sitting with you in the western arbor, an hour since?"</p> 
                  <p>Rebecca could not deceive her father, though she knew his displeasure would be incurred, and she answered innocently-</p> 
                  <p>"The young man who makes his home at the house of our neighbor Soule."</p> 
                  <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6124-00000150"/> 
                  <p>"I do not like him; he's puritanic. But I would talk with you in the mansion."</p> 
                  <p>A part of this reply was uttered with peculiar bitterness; and as Rebecca walked with her father to the house, a pallor overspread her countenance, a tear trembled on her drooping eye-lashes, and a tremor shook her frame, so that her parent plainly noticed her agitation. Mordecai Milius was a native of Hamburg, but had for many years been a resident of the United States, and had amassed immense wealth by "lending moneys." He was not old, but he was very feeble, and had reason to feel that each day might be his last on the earth-side of the tomb.</p> 
                  <p>When he had tottered to his room in the mansion, his daughter brought him a large easy-chair, and seated herself on an ottoman at his feet. Putting his broad hand gently upon her head, he said-</p> 
                  <p>"Abrams, your relative, was here from the city this morning. He asks your hand in marriage. He is a young man of promise in our society, and I would have you wed him."</p> 
                  <p>"But, father--"</p> 
                  <p>"Nay, nay, child. It <emph>must</emph> be so. Remember you are mine, in another sense than as a daughter. Before I die I would see you safe; Abrams is of the same blood, and he must be your husband."</p> 
                  <p>"I can never love him, father. I know all you would say, but--"</p> 
                  <p>"I tell thee nay, child. It <emph>shall</emph> be as I say. I grow weaker every day. You have notions in your head that never can be realized-I would see you wedded, and on the first day of Passover, which comes next week, the ceremony <emph>must</emph> be held."</p> 
                  <p>"So soon, father?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ay, so soon. You can go to your lessons now."</p> 
                  <p>Rebecca retired from the presence of her obdurate father, but not to her lessons. Hastening to her room, she wrote the following note-</p>

                              <p>"DEAR EVERETT-I have just learned plainly, from father, that he is determined I shall marry Abrams. I loathe him; I will suffer death first. I could not talk to father, but I <emph>must</emph> talk to you. I will sacrifice anything to fulfil the vows we have plighted, but how can it be?

                  <p>Hastily sealing this note, she went rapidly in quest of a slave who had her confidence, and, with<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6124-00000151"/> many injunctions of caution and secrecy, intrusted it to his care.</p> 
                  <p>Everett Edwards was a young man of New England energy, who, without fortune, had won his way honorably through a severe collegiate course of education, and was now at the South teaching, to procure means for the study of a profession.</p> 
                  <p>He had been for a time, apparently, a welcome visitor at the mansion of Mordecai Milius, but the crafty Jew, observing a growing intimacy between him and Rebecca, and such a union being, in all respects, contrary to his calculations for his daughter, he had, without giving a reason, forbidden Edwards to come to his house. But this did not prevent the young man from seeing Rebecca often. Their vows were plighted, but there was an insuperable barrier in the way of their marriage. The law of the land declared that no white man should wed a woman of negro extraction. Rebecca's mother (many years deceased) had been a slave-her daughter was a Quadroon.</p> 
               </div> 
               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <p>IT was the third night from the meeting appointed by Rebecca on the lawn. The plantation clock had struck two of the hours of morning. Three persons emerged from a negro cabin, in the rear of the Milius mansion, and crossed the lawn towards the main road leading to a city. In a few moments two of them had entered a carriage, and the third had taken the driver's seat. The horses were urged with all speed towards the city.</p> 
                  <p>"Be calm, Rebecca," said Everett Edwards, after they had ridden some distance.</p> 
                  <p>"Is all prepared?" she asked nervously.</p> 
                  <p>"To the last line," he replied.</p> 
                  <p>"Is it not dreadful?" she returned. "I met Abrams to-night in father's room, and resolved to suffer anything <emph>myself,</emph> rather than wed him; but I shudder when I think of it-Everett, you will be debased-negroes are debased-when you have taken the oath to marry me, you will be an outcast; I cannot suffer it."</p> 
                  <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6124-00000152"/> 
                  <p>"Be calm, Rebecca," said Everett, in a soothing tone, "I shall take no false oath. From your slave's arm did I not eject blood into mine, and what care I for the forms observed among the people here. I shall feel no debasement, I shall be the same I am now, and we will not long remain among a people who would despise us for no cause. Have I not saved the means to take us far away? We have gone too far to think of shrinking now."</p> 
                  <p>"I know it-I know it, Everett, but I have much to distract me. Father was very sick last night; I shall probably never see him again. If he should die to-night, what might become of me? Who would be your wife, Everett? Perhaps Abrams' slave. Have you thought of this, Everett?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, dearest, I know all the advantages that might be taken of cruel laws. But your father loved you, and on his death bed, would not leave you in the power of wicked men. Be assured they shall not have power over you."</p> 
                  <p>"They shall not, if you can shield me, I know, Everett, but your arm would be powerless-"</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, Rebecca, the coach stops," interrupted Everett, as the driver reined up before a church "In a few moments you will be mine, and I shall be prepared for the worst that may come."</p> 
                  <p>Everett was obliged to support Rebecca as they walked down the aisle of the church to the altar, where a priest was in waiting. She leaned on him during the ceremony, and almost swooned when they entered the carriage again, to be driven to a hotel. Her emotions were of a most peculiar and distracting character.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Rebecca had not been absent from her room half an hour, before a slave knocked upon the door, and gave a summons for her to hasten to her father. There came no answer, and again and again the slave knocked, and then she entered and found the room vacant.</p> 
                  <p>"Missus rundaway, massa," said the slave wildly, as she burst into her master's room, in a moment after she had satisfied herself that Rebecca was missing.</p> 
                  <p>"Abrams," said the Jew, feebly, to the young man who stood at his bed-side. "See if her waiting man, Tom, is gone. If he is, bring his wife here instantly. Oh, God of Abraham and Isaac, this <emph>will</emph> kill me."</p> 
                  <p>Abrams was prompt in the execution of his<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6124-00000153"/> mission, and the slave-woman was immediately dragged before her owner, nearly frightened to death.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is your mistress?" he demanded, with a spasmodic effort, rising on one elbow in his bed, as Abrams hastened to support him.</p> 
                  <p>"I dun know, massa," said the negress in a weak voice.</p> 
                  <p>"You <emph>do,</emph> you wench, and you shall tell, or take five hundred lashes."</p> 
                  <p>"Dey gone wid Tom, massa."</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Who?</emph>"</p> 
                  <p>The slave had promised not to tell, but the thought of five hundred lashes was terrible. She stammered and hesitated.</p> 
                  <p>"Tell, you wench, or you shall be whipped instantly," said the Jew, "and if you tell all, I'll forgive Tom."</p> 
                  <p>This determined the negress, and she answered:</p> 
                  <p>"Tom take Massa Edwards and Missus, 'bout two o'clock, to de city in de carriage. Dey stop at de big hotel."</p> 
                  <p>"Let them be followed," gasped the Jew, as a spasm seized him, and he fell back in Abrams' arms. His emotions and his efforts had been too much for his wasting frame, and without another word, but with many painful groans, he died, as Abrams held him.</p> 
                  <p>No sooner had the "vital spark fled," than Abrams ordered all the attendants from the room. When Rebecca had been sent for, a strong box, containing papers and jewels, had been laid on the bed. This Abrams now opened, and examining its contents for a few moments, he soliloquized:</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, ha! I've lost a wife, but the <emph>fortune</emph> may be mine. Mordecai had no other relative here but his daughter, beside me. But for these papers, she is a slave. She may be <emph>my</emph> slave-she <emph>shall</emph> be; but I must act with dispatch."</p> 
                  <p>Abrams closed the box, put a roll of papers in an under pocket, and summoned his servant. While the slave stood waiting, he wrote:</p>

                  <p>"Take this note, Cap," said the young Jew to his slave, "to the hotel -- in the city, and give it to no one but Rebecca Milius. You will ride<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6124-00000154"/> my horse-be swift, and I'll reward you. Don't spare the horse."</p> 
                  <p>"Neber fear me, Massa, dat hoss hab to trabel," said the negro, as he hurried from his master's presence. When the door had closed behind him, Abrams locked it, saying,</p> 
                  <p>"Now I must work, I know how to do it, and this plantation and appurtenances shall be mine before day dawns."</p> 
                  <p>He seated himself at a table, on which paper and ink had been placed, and diligently began the work of putting Mordecai Milius' property out of the reach or control of his daughter.</p> 
                  <p>Abrams was the son of a cousin of Mordecai Milius, by a slave who was a sister to the mother of Rebecca. He was believed, however, to be a white man, and knowing that his extraction could not be proven, he had no fears that he could not hold the property, and make Rebecca <emph>his</emph> slave, which he had resolved to do, if she were married to Edwards.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll be revenged," he muttered with set teeth, as he worked at his plan of villany.</p>

Rebecca hastened to her father's chamber to receive his forgiveness and his blessing, and prepare him to meet her husband. What a scene greeted her-With such an expression as we may suppose Shylock wore when gloating in the prospect of terrible revenge upon the christian Antonio, Abrams stood before her, and upon the bed, as he had died, lay her father.</p> 
                  <p>Instantly a terrible suspicion took possession of her mind, and with a fearful shriek she fell upon the floor. Edwards was not far distant, and as<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6124-00000155"/> the shriek pierced his ear, he flew to the chamber. Abrams was supporting Rebecca; with a movement of powerful energy, the indignant husband thrust the Jew back, and applied restoratives for his wife's recovery.</p> 
                  <p>"Rebecca, Rebecca," he cried, "<emph>I</emph> am with you."</p> 
                  <p>"Ah, ha," chuckled Abrams, "it's over, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>In a few minutes Rebecca was able to sit up, but how changed. She looked as if in the brief period of one quarter of an hour, more years than she had passed had been added to her age. She clung nervously to her husband, and when she could speak, said feebly:</p> 
                  <p>"You will not leave me again, Everett. How I dread that man," looking towards Abrams.</p> 
                  <p>"What means this?" demanded Edwards, approaching the Jew.</p> 
                  <p>"It means, sir, that, as I suspect, if you have married that girl you have married my slave," said Abrams, with ill-feigned calmness.</p> 
                  <p>"It is false-<emph>damnably</emph> false," retorted Edwards.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold, young man," said Abrams; "be careful how you talk. To marry her, you took oath of your degraded blood. Remember <emph>who</emph> you are- 
                     <emph>what</emph> you are, and <emph>where</emph> you are. What are negroes in this land? You know as well as I can tell you."</p> 
                  <p>Edwards was startled at the danger of his position, but he could not yield to the Jew. He did not believe Rebecca's father had left her in this man's power, and he fiercely demanded,</p> 
                  <p>"By what right do you dare to talk to me, and to my wife as you have done. If I do not be revenged, there is no justice in Heaven!"</p> 
                  <p>"By your oath you are a negro," returned Abrams. "I do not often parley with negroes, but I'll tell you, I am the heir of Mordecai Milius, and she is my slave. The proofs of her birth are abundant. Here are the papers; I'll show them to those who have civil rights to demand them."</p> 
                  <p>"Her freedom shall be purchased at <emph>any</emph> price" cried the husband.</p> 
                  <p>"Not till my death," answered Abrams. "She would not be my wife-now she is my property-my <emph>slave</emph>-she shall be my <emph>mistress.</emph>"</p> 
                  <p>"Offer to lay hand upon her, and by the eternal God, that instant you die," cried Edwards, wildly, as he threw an arm around Rebecca, while she clung to him as if her existence depended on her grasp.</p> 
                  <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6124-00000156"/> 
                  <p>Stepping to the door, Abrams cried, "Help! help!"</p> 
                  <p>Half a dozen lusty slaves in a moment stood before him.</p> 
                  <p>"I am your master," he said, "since the death of Mordecai Milius. Put that man out of this room and out of this <emph>house.</emph>"</p> 
                  <p>The slaves rushed towards Edwards. Rebecca swooned. Her husband supported her, and while his eyes glared almost as if they emitted living fire, exclaimed,</p> 
                  <p>"Touch me on the peril of your lives."</p> 
                  <p>The coward slaves hesitated, and Abrams cried,</p> 
                  <p>"Take him out, I say, or every one of you shall be whipped within an inch of your lives."</p> 
                  <p>The slaves, with a sudden impulse, rushed towards Edwards, when, allowing Rebecca to recline against a table, he grasped a heavy chair, and levelled the foremost negro upon the floor, and would have struck down others, had not Abrams at this moment stepped before him, and, with a pistol, which he had obtained from a secret drawer in the desk where he had been writing during the night, cocked in his hand, cried-</p> 
                  <p>"I command you to leave this house instantly, or you shall be dragged out <emph>dead</emph> by these slaves."</p> 
                   
                  <p>Madly desperate, Edwards scarcely waited until this threat was uttered, before he aimed a violent blow at the Jew; but it had not spent itself when the report of a pistol rang through the apartment, the chair fell from Edwards' hands, and he dropped to the floor a corpse.</p> 
                  <p>Rebecca, who had partly recovered, was fully restored physically, when the pistol was fired. As if possessed with the wildness and fury of a maniac-her large dark eyes rolling wildly, her hair dishevelled-she rushed towards the door-Abrams cried,</p> 
                  <p>"Begone, slaves," and arrested her by throwing her arms around her.</p> 
                  <p>"Away, wretch-<emph>fiend,</emph>" she cried, violently endeavoring to free herself from his embrace.</p> 
                  <p>As the slaves withdrew he released his hold, and locked the door behind him. Rebecca stood like a statue. He approached her, and, while his face glowed with the expression of a demon, exclaimed,</p> 
                  <p>"Now you <emph>shall</emph> be mine as <emph>I</emph> will," but her look and attitude awed him-she was evidently frantic. Pointing to the dead body of her father, then to that of her husband, with the weird tone of one whose reason had been dethroned, she said, as if measuring the force of her words-</p> 
                  <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6124-00000157"/> 
                  <p>"By the corpse of her father; over the dead body of her husband whom you murdered, dare you sacrifice an unfortunate wife because law gives you the power?"</p> 
                  <p>Abrams had only time to answer, "Rebecca," and approach one step towards her, when, as if to fold her hands together in an attitude of resignation, she crossed her arms on her breast, and, in a tone which seemed to be the utterance of a mental resolve that had forced itself into words, whispered-</p> 
                  <p>"I am ready."</p> 
                  <p>Instantly a crimson stream flowed over her bridal garments; and, before Abrams could reach her, she sank by the side of her husband, and her pure spirit winged its flight to the land where there are no bond-men or bond-women.</p> 
                  <p>The point of a stiletto, a present from her father, which she had carried many years, had drawn her heart's blood.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <p>THERE was no law in that land which could punish Abrams for the murder of Edwards. He claimed justification on the ground of self-defence, and his claim was allowed: but the circumstances of his death, and the forced suicide of his wife, caused so much excitement, that the Jew thought it best for him to make his home in a distant part of the country. When the funeral rites had been attended to he made preparations for the sale of the plantation and the property connected with it; at the first opportunity disposed of them, and hastened to the city of New Orleans.</p> 
                  <p>He invested his falsely-obtained wealth in real estate, and lived like a king (so far as outward show was concerned), and perhaps, like many kings, did he live in secret, when the memory of his crimes forced itself upon his mind.</p> 
                  <p>He had been in New Orleans some years, when he accidentally made the acquaintance of a young man who proved to be a son of Mordecai Milius,<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6124-00000158"/> by a Creole, who had been the maid of Rebecca's mother. The young man was a slave. Abrams purchased him, and gave him his freedom; more than this-he placed him at a high-school, and promised him a liberal education. The young man was most grateful, because he did not divine the reasons which made Abrams thus philanthropic.</p> 
                  <p>A pestilence brooded over the Crescent City-the atmosphere was loaded with death-badges of mourning were fluttering from almost every door-knob, and the streets were lined with funeral processions. Citizens were fleeing in all directions, while they were stricken down on the streets, in the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cafes,</foreign> at their homes, and when thronging the highways. Among those who endeavored to flee from the destroyer was the rich man Abrams; he was overtaken and prostrated at noonday. He felt that his hour had come, and he dispatched a servant for his ward.</p> 
                  <p>The young man did not arrive till the death-dews had begun to gather on the brow of the semi-Jew.</p> 
                  <p>He reached his hand to the youth, and groaned.</p> 
                  <p>"These papers are yours. My property is all yours. I was the murderer of your father's only daughter. His property was mine <emph>by forgery!</emph>"</p> 
                   
                  <p>The young man started back at these fearful words, and looked upon the livid corpse of the wicked Abrams.</p> 
                  <p>The papers which had been given him were the will of Mordecai Milius.</p>

               <head>PINNEY'S PEPPER BOTTLE.</head> 
               <p>"WE have a nice town here," said Mr. Pinney.</p> 
               <p>"A very pretty village," I replied. "You have known it for many years?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I came 'out West' from old Connecticut when it was all woods here; deer and wild turkeys were as plenty then as sheep and chickens now."</p> 
               <p>"You own large tracts of land; I presume you had money in your purse when you immigrated?"</p> 
               <p>"Not five dollars in the world," answered Mr. Pinney, as a shadow crossed his features, which seemed to me to be cast from an image of sorrow that dwelt in his heart.</p> 
               <p>I dare not ask leading questions, and there was a pause in our conversation.</p> 
               <p>I was riding with the richest man of -- township, in one of the northern counties of Ohio.</p> 
               <p>He had reined in his horse at a point near the village where he resided. While we conversed, we looked down upon a valley along which lengthened shadows were creeping and dying, while the tops of the forest trees near us were glowing in the evening sun's farewell smile.</p> 
               <p>When he had answered my question respecting his wealth at the time he became an immigrant, Mr. Pinney struck his horse with his whip, and we were whirled through the village. I was introduced to Mr. P.'s family at his farm house-for such his residence was, in fact, though it stood upon a village street. Behind it lay a large tract of land, cultivated under Mr. P.'s immediate superintendence.</p> 
               <p>Supper over-"Tea," as city ladies employ the word, is not taken at farm houses in the West-Mr. Pinney invited me to walk in the garden.</p> 
               <p>I was anxious to give the conversation a turn which would explain to me why Mr. P. had appeared sorrowful when I spoke of his settlement in the township; but, without special design at the moment, asked:</p> 
               <p>"Has property changed hands often in this neighborhood?"</p> 
               <p>"Quite so-quite so," answered Mr. P., with a sharp glance at my countenance.</p> 
               <p>"Such of the old settlers as are here yet are no<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6124-00000160"/> doubt well off in the world. Are there many of them?" I ventured to inquire.</p> 
               <p>"About half a dozen-not more," replied my host.</p> 
               <p>I expressed some astonishment at this intelligence, and Mr. Pinney said:</p> 
               <p>"We'll take a seat and arrange our business now, but I wish to show you my farm and stock in the morning, and then I promise to give you an outline of the history of our village."</p> 
               <p>I had an intuition that this history would reveal the cause of the sorrow I had suspected in Mr. Pinney's heart, when I saw the shadow which passed over his countenance on alluding to his wealth, and I was grateful for the promise, but not glad of the postponement accompanying it. However, I consoled myself with the practical man's motto, "Business before pleasure," and entered upon a calculation about values and incomes, which did not permit Mr. Pinney to show me to my chamber till a very late hour.</p> 
               <p>I was called, however, betimes in the morning, and immediately after breakfast was out on the farm with Mr. Pinney. When I had admired the manner of agriculture and the beauty of the stock, and been told the character of fruit in the orchard chard, Mr. Pinney led the way toward the farmhouse, and then said:</p> 
               <p>"I have not forgotten my promise; and if you still desire to know the history of our little town, I will give you what I consider most important."</p> 
               <p>I assured him that I was much interested in the promised sketch, and he began:</p> 
               <p>"My father was a merchant in old Connecticut, and I was a wild boy from 'the land of steady habits.' I left home when I was eighteen years of age, because of some restraints that had been imposed on me, which I considered tyrannical. I soon found that it was easier to endure restraints at home than be 'my own master' in the world, and I wanted to go back to my father's house, but my pride rebelled, and I joined a party of emigrants and came 'out West.' The emigrants settled here. They cut a road through the forest forty miles, before they found a spot that suited them-I was not accustomed to severe muscular labor, and I was the hunter of the expedition. I had many an adventure which delighted my romantic disposition. I became hardy and vigorous, and was soon able to help the squatters in clearing up their farms. We went twenty miles to mill-had no school for five years, and never heard a<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6124-00000161"/> sermon preached (though there were many read), till we had put three crops of grain in our log barns. Then other settlers came in, and a Methodist preacher met those who were disposed to hear him, at one of the log cabins, once a month. Meantime, I had taken a squatter's daughter for a wife, and had a cabin and a few acres of ground, for which the government had been paid. I had been a hunter and farmer, wood-chopper and school-teacher about six years, when I received word from Connecticut that a small stock of goods had been consigned to me at Pittsburg. I went out to the Ohio, and up to Pittsburg with an ox team, and when I returned I opened a store in a log cabin, on the spot where my son's store now stands, on the corner opposite my house. It would make a shabby appearance now-a-days, but it was a great affair in our settlement. I had a few groceries, nutmegs and spices, combs and nails, garden seeds and calicoes, thread and coarse cloth, candies and tobacco, and a very small stock of either, but there was no other store within a circle of fifteen miles, and I soon did, what I considered, a brisk trade.</p> 
               <p>"Some of the land had been low, and here and there were small marshes. When the country was cleared up, and it began to look like farming about here, there came a sickly season, and in almost every family some one had the fever and ague, and the doctor from the nearest town was getting everybody in his debt; but the ague was not eradicated. There had never been any whisky sold in the settlement, but now it was needed for bitters to keep off the chills, and when I sent for goods I ordered a barrel, and had a lot of drugs with it, and everybody got a bottle of bitters. When winter came, the ague pretty generally disappeared, but the fashion of taking bitters did not disappear with it.</p> 
               <p>"The pioneers had disheartening times, and too many of them endeavored to cheer their hearts with that which stole away their brains-I did not blame them much in those days, but I see now, sorrowfully, where I was to blame then. What think you?"</p> 
               <p>This was a strange question to me under the circumstances, but I answered it.</p> 
               <p>"Assuredly, Mr. Pinney, you have had experience enough in the world and opportunities of observation enough to convince you that such indulgences as you speak of, to express my thoughts in common parlance, "don't pay," but after all,<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6124-00000162"/> I always exercise compassion for those unfortunate men who never have a gleam of joy in their hearts, unless it is reflected from the fire which alcohol lights in the brain."</p> 
               <p>"Exactly my idea," said Mr. Pinney; "but while we compassionate, we should never forget to instruct. That's where I went astray. Now let me tell you the consequence. Many men had lost their wives-many their children-some both-they had been pious men-but opportunities for religious instruction or encouragement were not frequent, and when they did offer, were generally uninviting, and with hard work and watching, men were worn out. I had kept in my store a bottle of whisky, impregnated with pepper, as a sort of guard against chills, and sometimes I offered a glass to my most particular friends. They grew fond of it, and my bottle was often empty. The popularity of my medicine increased, and I soon found myself selling large quantities of whisky and black pepper, and in a few months drunkenness had widely extended in our settlement; and did we stop it?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Pinney looked at me as if expecting an answer, but I was silent, and he continued:</p> 
               <p>"No; farms were neglected-everybody was in debt-the farmers to the shoemaker, the tailor and the blacksmith, and all these to me; and when I saw the evil, I couldn't stop it, and in a few years I was virtually owner of one-third of the farms in the settlement, and all on account of ague bitters and my pepper bottle. Drunkards who owed me heavy notes for goods to support their families, died, and the farm was given me to pay the debt; and I felt myself doing a great wrong, but I was getting rich; and if I had undertaken it, I could not have changed the course of events. But a Yankee school-teacher came into the settlement, and he hadn't been here a month till he called a meeting at the school-house for a lecture, and the school-house was crowded, for it was a great novelty, and to the astonishment of everybody, he exposed the liquor business among us, and showed me to be a living curse. Stones were thrown at him, and he was interrupted, and the people would have thrown him out of the school-house, but I forbid them, and declared that the school-master told the truth. Then the people listened attentively; and the next day I made a bonfire of my liquors, and there was no more whisky sold in our neighborhood till we had the<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6124-00000163"/> canal built within a few miles of it; and now no man dare sell it in our village."</p> 
               <p>"What have you to regret, Mr. Pinney?" I inquired.</p> 
               <p>"You ask that but to quiet my mind," he replied. "I have no need of such quiet. Every foot of land which could go to friends or kindred here, I left unaffected by my mortgages; some have been paid, some have not; but when I die, the just heirs will find deeds in their names, and now all of the income of the property I hold in my name, except a respectable support for my family, is devoted to the improvement of our village, and to the promotion of religion and education among our people; and yet I am a most unhappy man. Pinney's Pepper Bottle left an influence here which two generations cannot outlive, and the conviction rests upon me with crushing force, that no man who has for one year been instrumental in making drunkenness in a neighborhood, can counteract the evil influence by twenty years of devotion to objects of charity and reform, with an ample fortune at his command; therefore, am I sorrowful whenever I think of what ague bitters did here. Better disease-better chills and fever and ultimate death on account of 
                  <emph>them,</emph> than poverty, and degradation and death from drunkenness. Am I not right?"</p> 
               <p>I could but answer Mr. Pinney in the affirmative, and then he said:</p> 
               <p>"Now, sir, I have never opened my heart to any man out of my family as I have done to you. I was led irresistibly into my confession, and it seems to me for good. In reparation for what evil I have done, I can do nothing more than I am doing, but to set my wrong example and the curse of our settlement before the world, you are at liberty, sir, to publish my confession."</p>

               <head>THE FALLEN DIVINE.</head> 
               <p>ONE extremely fine day in the fall of 1847, upon the deck of a beautiful steamer, ploughing the Hudson river, between New York and Albany, a tall man, of gentlemanly and commanding appearance, walked leisurely backwards and forwards. He was evidently a foreigner, from his expansive forehead, and his expressive countenance beamed forth evidence of talent, education, and distinction. As the noble steamer sped on gallantly through the bright water, his soul seemed to drink in the grandeur and magnificence of that classic American scenery, so frequently the subject of eloquent song and verse. The close observer might perceive, however, that the course of life with him had not always "flowed smoothly on," for, at times, a cloud of gloom overspread his countenance, as though the remembrance of some over-the-sea sorrow suddenly brought "the light of other days" around him.</p> 
                
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>A few days subsequent to the landing of this steamer at Albany, a crowd of vagrants and loafers were sitting at their ease upon the boxes and barrels which lie around the dock of that city. Among them was one with an old slouched hat, and a filthy suit of what had once been black cloth, upon his person, who leaned against a barrel, in a state of almost unconscious lethargy. The memories of the world, with its griefs and sorrows, its strifes and longings, its delusive hopes and gloomy reverses, were for the moment drowned in the bowl; yet there was an air about him, the half distinguished remnant of former rank and consequence, which shone out through all the stupor and filth in which intemperance had disguised <emph>the man,</emph> and revealed the vestiges of a once noble and manly spirit-an intelligent, useful citizen.</p> 
               <p>A policeman's attention was directed to this mass of human degradation, and taking several of the most abandoned in their appearance under his protection-the "gentleman" in rusty black among the rest, they were conducted to the Mayor's office, and failing to give a satisfactory account of themselves, were ordered to prison, twenty days, on bread and water.</p> 
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6124-00000165"/> 
               <p>The Chaplain, in his daily visits to the prison, soon observed traits of character about one of the prisoners not common to such a place. He endeavored to make his acquaintance, and draw from him his history-but in vain.</p> 
               <p>For some time he was sullen and morose, unwilling to converse, and apparently displeased when spoken to. In a few days, however, kindness gained an influence over him, and one morning, when the Chaplain said to him-</p> 
               <p>"Sir, I judge from your bearing, that you have seen better circumstances than you are at present placed in," he replied, while his eyes filled with tears,</p> 
               <p>"I have, sir."</p> 
               <p>"May I inquire your name," said the Chaplain.</p> 
               <p>"I <emph>was, once,</emph> Dr. N--, of Glasgow, Scotland."</p> 
               <p>The Chaplain was astounded. Could it be possible that the eloquent divine, whose productions he so passionately admired, was the inmate of that prison-the companion of felons? Was not this some bold, accomplished impostor? He flew in haste to Dr. S--, an eminent clergyman of Albany. Said he,</p> 
               <p>"Dr. N--, of Scotland is in the city."</p> 
                
               <p>"Ah!" replied Dr. S--,"I have not seen his arrival announced in the papers. I should be pleased to see him. Have you enjoyed that privilege?"</p> 
               <p>"I have, sir. I left him but a few moments ago, in the common jail."</p> 
               <p>"Impossible!" sharply replied the Dr. "Some wretch is imposing upon you!"</p> 
               <p>"I think not, Dr. Will you walk up, and satisfy yourself?" mildly answered the Chaplain.</p> 
               <p>"No, sir. I'll do no such thing. I am not so easily humbugged," and the Dr., turning upon his heel, walked away.</p> 
               <p>The Chaplain was in a quandary. He might be imposed upon, yet he could not believe it was so.</p> 
               <p>He walked down the street, and had not proceeded but a few squares, before he met another clerical friend. To him he related the circumstances, and after a few moments conversation, persuaded him to visit the prison. The minister was at once convinced that this person was no common felon; yet he could not but suspect that he might be an accomplished impostor, and, in the course of his conversation, remarked-</p> 
               <p>"How shall we be convinced of the truth of<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6124-00000166"/> your statement, sir, that you are the individual you assume to be?"</p> 
               <p>As though deeply offended at being considered a dissembler, he disdainfully replied,</p> 
               <p>"I have been robbed of my money, sir, but had I the means to get my papers from the hotel, at which I put up when I arrived in the city, I could soon satisfy you that I am no impostor."</p> 
               <p>A messenger was about to be dispatched to the hotel, when the prison door opened, and a fourth person joined the company. He had been a parishioner of Dr. N--, a few years previous, and having accidentally met Dr. S--, was informed of his conversation with the Chaplain.</p> 
               <p>"I'll go up there and confront the villain," said he. But what was his consternation, when he indeed found Dr. N--, of Glasgow, Scotland, the companion of felons--the able Divine, to whose thrilling eloquence he had so frequently listened with pleasure and profit, in a loathsome condition, the inmate of a common jail. It was no dream, no delusion. As soon as their eyes met, a mutual recognition took place.</p> 
               <p>By application to the proper authorities Dr. N-- was immediately released from his disgraceful graceful and unpleasant companionship, and taken under the care of kind and sympathizing friends.</p> 
               <p>How came this distinguished Divine-one of Scotland's strongest men-once the intimate friend and companion of the eminent Chalmers, in that ignoble situation? The cause is summed up in one word-a word which comprehends more of human wretchedness than all others-<emph>Intemperance.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>Scottish ministers nearly all use wine as freely as our ministers did before Washingtonianism dispelled the clouds of error, and permitted the mellow radiance of the sun of Total Abstinence to illumine their minds.</p> 
               <p>This minister, as we have intimated, occupied one of the most important pulpits in the kingdom. He is a man of renown, not only in Europe, but in America. With less of what some men call "<emph>moral principle,</emph>" than others who drank with him, he became so affected with wine, repeatedly, that he was summoned to give an account of himself. He could not bear to stand trial on such a charge, before men whose only <emph>moral</emph> superiority consisted in the possession of systems that could endure potions which overthrew him. He accordingly resigned his charge, and under an assumed name, sailed for America. He landed at New<pb n="332-333 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6124-00000167"/> York, and took passage, as the reader has already learned, for Albany.</p> 
               <p>He was among strangers-dare not make himself known, for fear his discovery would lead to inquiries which he preferred should have an oblivious doom. Gloomy feelings of despondency and loneliness pressed heavily upon his mind. For a time he bore up manfully against this mountain weight of grief and remorse. At length he thought to take but a single glass, to cheer his drooping spirits. His appetite returned upon him in full force, and in a few hours he was a reeling drunkard. His money was stolen from him. His hat and coat were exchanged by some villain for those more becoming a drunkard, and he was taken up as a common vagrant. Rather than reveal his character, he went to prison.</p> 
               <p>This is no fancy sketch, no tale of the imagination; it is emphatically an "ower true tale." The facts were communicated to the writer by an eminent Divine and <emph>true</emph> philanthropist, now deceased (Rev. Charles Van Loon, of Poughkeepsie, N. Y.) who was cognizant of them.</p>

               <p>EDITED, WITH MEMOIRS, NOTES, AND ILLUSTRATIONS, BY DR. SHELTON MACKENZIE, EDITOR OF SHEIL'S "SKETCHES OF THE IRISH BAR."</p> 
               <p>The Noctes were commenced in 1822, and closed in 1835. Even in England, the lapse of years has obscured many circumstances which were well known thirty years ago.</p> 
               <p>DR. SHELTON MACKENZIE, already favorably known as editor of Sheil's "Sketches of the Irish Bar," has undertaken the editorship of THE NOCTES AMBROSIAN, for which a familiar acquaintance, during the last twenty-five years, with the persons, events, and places therein noticed may be assumed to qualify him. He has been on terms of intimacy with most of the eminent political and literary characters treated of in the "NOCTES," and his annotation of the text will include personal recollections of them.</p> 
               <p>Besides this, Dr. Mackenzie has written for this edition a "History of the Rise and Progress of Blackwood's Magazine," with original memoirs of the principal accredited authors of the "NOCTES," viz:-Professor Wilson, The Ettrick Shepherd, J. G. Lockhart, and Dr. Maginn.</p> 
               <p>He will also give the celebrated "Chaldee Manuscript," published in 1817, instantly suppressed, and so scarce that the only copy which the editor has ever seen is that from which he makes the present reprint. There will also be given the three articles, entitled "CHRISTOPHER IN THE TENT," (in August and September, 1819), never before printed, in any shape, in this country. The interlocutors in "THE TENT," include the greater number of those afterwards introduced in the "NOCTES."</p> 
               <p>The "Metricum Symphosium Ambrosianum,"-an addendum to No. III. of "THE NOCTES," (and which notices every living author of note, in the year 1822), will be incorporated in this edition. This has never before been reprinted here.</p>

               <p>FOR more than a quarter of a century, the most remarkable magazine writer of his time, was the late William Maginn, LL. D., well-known as the Sir Morgan Odoherty of <title>Blackwood's Magazine,</title> and as the principal contributor, for many years, to <title>Fraser's</title> and other periodicals. The combined learning, wit, eloquence, eccentricity, and humor of Maginn, had obtained for him, long before his death, (in 1843), the title of THE MODERN RABELAIS. His magazine articles possess extraordinary merit. He had the art of putting a vast quantity of animal spirits upon paper, but his graver articles-which contain sound and serious principles of criticism-are earnest and well-reasoned.</p> 
               <p>The collection now in hand will contain his Faceti (in a variety of languages), Translations, Travesties, and Original Poetry, also his prose Tales, which are eminently beautiful, the best of his critical articles, (including his celebrated Shakspeare Papers), and his Homeric Ballads. The periodicals in which he wrote have been ransacked, from "Blackwood" to "Punch," and the result will be a series of great interest.</p> 
               <p>DR. SHELTON MACKENZIE, who has undertaken the editorship of these writings of his distinguished countryman, will spare neither labor nor attention in the work. The first volume will contain an original Memoir of Dr. Maginn, written by Dr. Mackenzie, and a characteristic Portrait, with fac-simile.</p>
