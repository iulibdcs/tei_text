            <head>PREFACE.</head> 
            <p>READER, although we may have met elsewhere, perhaps it were better that you and I should become still better acquainted, before you commence to read our Antique Tale. Let us caution you against expecting to be led by us into homes of showy luxuries; for our story dates far back, at a time when forest trees grew thick where now are spread out large cities; when New England respectability did not depend on the gloss of a coat, or the amount of stock in a bank; when a home was a <emph>home,</emph> without velvet and tapestry. We write of a time when a man was thought to be honest and truthful till his dark deeds were so plain that even the most unsuspecting could but be aware of them.</p> 
            <p>I do not place before you a work of entire fiction;-no, for there are those now living who have heard their grandsires tell strange tales of<pb n="iv-v (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC5991-00000005"/> many of the characters introduced here, and can point out to you the spot where the gibbet stood on which Jeffers suffered.</p> 
            <p>I do not send this book out before the great and discriminating public thinking it perfect in plot or style; but because my literary efforts have always been kindly received, my readers seeming to judge it better to give a cheering word of encouragement to one who tried to please them, trusting that her future motto would be Excelsior.</p> 
            <p>Often, in penning these pages, I have asked myself the question, Will this book please all? and as often has the answer come, mentally, No, there never was a book that pleased every one; neither was there ever a book without friends. The number that mine shall have, kind public, I leave for you to decide. That your memory may retain all that is good in the work before you, and cast to oblivion all that is unworthy, is the wish of</p>

               <p>STRANGERS said that the old ferry-house stood in a lonely spot,-for from its portal could not be seen the smoke from the neighboring chimneys, as it curled upward and wafted off through the ethereal blue. But Farmer Ashland thought differently of the old homestead, as he stood on the rough, flat stone at the sill of his door; for he could look out on the broad Atlantic, and see the white sails of the homeward bound, as<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5991-00000007"/> they swept past, to bear their freights to the loved ones waiting. He loved to look on the sea-washed shore and rugged cliffs of the Narraganset, and watch the foaming surf, as it beat and dashed against the rocks, and sent up its frozen spray, to fall again, in adamantine globules, on the old, weather-beaten roof.</p> 
               <p>It was late in the fall, now, and the laborers had been paid for their toil. The corn-crib was full, and the flail hung against the rough boards within, ready to prepare the golden grain. The ox-yoke was laid aside, and Buck and Brown, with eyes half closed, were in their stalls, crunching lazily the hay they had helped to harvest; and the old white horse, with his long mane and shining sides, shared the comforts of the mossy-roofed barn, nor thought it a hardship now to trot slowly along, on Sunday, with the little green chaise-top wagon and its contents, to the house of God. Farmer Ashland had a double occupation; for, beside the duties of the farm, he owned and manned a small sloop, to convey travellers to a large town on the opposite side of the bay.</p> 
               <p>"There will be a great storm to-night, boys," said the farmer, as he looked up at the black clouds, and saw with what rapidity the heavy gusts of wind urged them onward, as if to concentrate their forces, and deluge the earth with their contents; "so make the boat fast to the pier, Richard,-put on an extra hawser, and make sure that she can't break away; for we should never see the Swallow again, if she should drift off to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir," answered the one addressed; and then, giving a look far out upon the ocean, he murmured<pb n=""/> to himself, "I pity all those that have n't a snug harbor;" and, as if to keep time with the wind, he whistled a plaintive air, and walked cautiously along the narrow pier, to do as he had been directed.</p> 
               <p>When Richard had disappeared behind the rocks, the farmer turned to another of the group, and said, "Nathan, you may drive the cows over to the west meadow, and put them under the shed; for it is going to be a hard night, and I don't want anything on my farm to suffer."</p> 
               <p>Nathan did not walk off with such a cheerful face as did the young sailor, for it was a long way, and the cows were so clumsy and slow that he feared he might not be back in season to share in the kettle of porridge that generally smoked on the oaken table in the farmer's kitchen at evening; but Mr. Ashland apparently did not notice this, and, as his word was always law among his household, the young man turned slowly away, and, pulling his rabbit-skin cap further over his eyes, to protect his face from the cold, gave a loud whoop to the tenants of the barn-yard, and departed on his errand. Some two or three more were standing around the farmer, to whom he gave different orders, in regard to housing the stock, and putting under cover all implements that had been used during the day; then, crossing his hands behind him, which was ever his attitude of thought, he walked slowly into the house.</p> 
               <p>Here was an air of comfort that the modern farmer may read of, but cannot realize, while seated in his airtight rooms, warmed by fires encased in iron. A pair of strong but slender fire-dogs of polished iron were<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5991-00000008"/> set in the centre of the rough stone fireplace, which was of such broad dimensions that often in the long winter evenings groups of young men and maidens from the neighboring farms would congregate in the corners and sing the popular songs of the olden time, or listen to legends of love and murder as they fell from the lips of their sires. The old blue dye-tub, the housewife's pride, was ever there, when the frost thickened on the windows, to comfortably seat the lucky one who should gain it first; and many a laugh went up the wide stone chimney, as by some playful stratagem one member of the household would obtain it from another, and enjoy the genial heat and bright blaze that kept the contents of the little covered oaken tub from congealing. When Mr. Ashland entered the kitchen, a young girl left her spinning-wheel and tripped lightly to his side; the farmer looked pleasantly into her face, and then extending his right arm, the girl assisted him to remove his outside garment. Then she placed a large leather-bottomed chair beside the round table where supper was set, and nearest the fire. "You're a good girl, Lucy," said the farmer, as he threw himself into the seat; "and now take up the johnny-cake and call the boys."</p> 
               <p>Lucy stepped into a chair and took from the mantel a large sea-shell, and then, going out on the stone step, she placed it to her lips and gave two or three shrill blasts, which were answered from the rocks by the well-known voice of Richard, and by loud shouts from others employed about the farm. The oaken pegs in the wash-room received the outer garments of the young men as they came in, and then all stepped<pb n=""/> lightly across the sanded floor, and took their accustomed places at the large round table. The sleet and rain now began to beat with violence against the windows, and the solitary oak that spread its broad branches over the roof groaned and creaked as the northern blast swept through it. Mr. Ashland gazed out into the thick darkness, and listened for a moment to the contending elements, to the roaring wind and furiously beating surf, and then glanced around on the pyramidal fire of oak which was burning on his hearth, making all look cheerful within.</p> 
               <p>"Let us pray," said the good man, and he bowed his head reverently to his breast. It was no exclusive prayer that the noble-hearted farmer sent up,-that God might peculiarly bless a few,-but all were included, from his own household to that of the remotest child of the Father. There were no smiles of derision or inattention depicted on the features of the group who surrounded him, but each one seemed to feel an interest in the petition; so, when the prayer was ended, a deep amen came from the lips of all present, both old and young.</p> 
               <p>When the meal was finished, and thanks returned to the Giver, Lucy set back her spinning-wheel, and tripped gayly around to clear the table, and arrange things for the morrow. Her mother drew near the fire a large round stand, and placed upon it a pair of candlesticks of polished brass; then, lighting the tallow candles they contained, she seated herself, and took from her pocket her knitting-work, and commenced her wonted evening's labor. Her husband reached from the mantel a well-worn family Bible, and began to scan its pages.<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5991-00000009"/> In a few moments he looked up from the book and said,</p> 
               <p>"You can close the shutters, Lucy, and pull in the latch-string; we shall have no more calls to-night. No human being that has a shelter will venture out in such a storm as this."</p> 
               <p>"I will do it for you," whispered Richard, as he leaned over from his seat on the old blue dye-tub, and brought his lips almost in contact with the rosy cheek of the farmer's only daughter, as she bent forward to hang the bake-kettle of dough on the crane, that steaming brown bread might be one of the luxuries of the morning.</p> 
               <p>"Do," she whispered back again, with a look that sent the blood of the young sailor into his handsome face, and thrilled every nerve with pleasurable emotion.</p> 
               <p>"You have lost your seat," said Nathan, springing past him, with a smothered laugh of triumph.</p> 
               <p>"You're welcome to it, boy," returned the other, as he passed him; "for when the old folks have gone to bed, Lucy and I will take a seat on the settle." Nathan bit his lip, as if by that means he would prevent an answer, and Richard went on. The farmer's eyes were on his book, and his wife's were on her knitting, so they did not notice what transpired between the younger members of the family.</p> 
               <p>"I hear a rumbling of wheels," said Richard, a few moments after he had pulled in the leather string that lifted the latch to the back door.</p> 
               <p>"You're mistaken, boy," said the farmer, as he put himself in a listening attitude; "for no one would stir abroad on such a night as this."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Perhaps some of the neighbors are sick," said Mrs. Ashland, getting up and throwing back the shutter to the window that overlooked the road; then, returning to the light-stand, she took up a candle, and set it on the window-seat to light the path that led to the house.</p> 
               <p>"It may be," said the farmer, "for I did not see brother Stacy at meeting yesterday, and he never stays away when he is well."</p> 
               <p>"He went up to the Narrow River Farm, Saturday, to see his son's family," replied the wife, "and I suppose he has not returned."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland bowed; as much as to say, that accounts for his absence.</p> 
               <p>The rumbling sound of the carriage-wheels was now so near that none could fail to hear it. "You need n't put on your boots again to-night," said Richard to his employer, as he saw him about to draw them on; "for I will see that all is right outside."</p> 
               <p>While he was speaking the carriage stopped at the little gate at the end of the path, and in a moment more the inmates thought they heard a sob outside the door at the front of the house. The farmer took the light and proceeded towards the door; but before he reached it several loud raps were given, and a female voice asked to be admitted.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," said Mr. Ashland, as he drew back the heavy bolt that secured the door, and lifted the latch. "Come right in, and--" He did not finish the sentence, for the wind and sleet, with one gigantic rush, forced the door back, and extinguished the light.</p> 
               <p>"God bless you!" was uttered by a strange, manly<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5991-00000010"/> voice, and was answered by a low, smothered sob from the one who had desired admission. Then came the sound of retreating footsteps, and the rolling wheels of some vehicle, as it passed over the frozen ground, and died away in the distance. "Follow me," said the farmer, as he threw open the inner door that led to the large square room, which we in more modern times should designate a parlor, but which the inmates of the homestead simply called <emph>the great room.</emph> The party groped their way through the darkness until Mr. Ashland reached the fireplace; then, taking a pair of tongs, he raked open the embers, and threw a faint light on his visitor.</p> 
               <p>"Seat yourself here," he said, "while I go and get some more wood. It has been so cold to-day that we have not had much company, and so I let the fire get down; but I can soon start it again."</p> 
               <p>"I am not cold," said the woman; "but can you not take me across the ferry to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"To-night!" said the farmer, as he relighted the candle. "Why, if the boat should leave the shore in such a gale as this, she would n't be afloat ten minutes. You can stay here to-night, and then, if the wind goes down, Richard or I will take you over in the morning as early as you like."</p> 
               <p>"It will be too late then," she said, while a sigh but half suppressed betrayed that she was making an effort to appear calm.</p> 
               <p>"Too late for-" <emph>what,</emph> the farmer was going to ask; but, recollecting it was no part of hospitality to inquire into the business of his guests, he stopped, and merely said that he should not be willing to risk his<pb n=""/> life or hers by venturing on the water in such a storm. And then, as he suddenly remembered that when she came to the door some one was with her, he said,</p> 
               <p>"But I must go and see to the horse, and invite your companion in." As he said this, Mr. Ashland noticed that she had a babe in her arms, which was so well protected from the weather that it lay sleeping as quietly in the warm shawls as if cradled on the softest pillow.</p> 
               <p>"The one who came with me has left," replied the woman, turning her face from the farmer.</p> 
               <p>"His business must have been pressing, or he would not have gone further to-night," said the other. But the woman made no reply, and he went out, but in a few moments returned, and asked her if she were willing to go to the kitchen, where there was a warmer fire.</p> 
               <p>"Are there many present?" she inquired.</p> 
               <p>"None," said the farmer, "except my family, any of whom will be happy to do you a kindness, and assist in taking care of the babe."</p> 
               <p>The traveller made no answer, but, pressing the infant more closely, she followed her guide to the kitchen of the farm-house, where the family spent more of their time than in any other room.</p> 
               <p>"Your mantle is wet," said Mrs. Ashland, as she approached the stranger, and, taking the babe, handed it to her daughter. "Why, how you tremble! you must be very cold." And then she removed the outside garment, untied her hood, and took it off. As she did so, each member of the family looked towards the others as if some beautiful and unexpected vision had<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5991-00000011"/> burst upon them. Dark masses of glossy curls now escaped from their confinement, and dropped gracefully to the shoulders and waist of the guest; and her slight figure was neatly attired in a travelling dress of fine texture and fashionable make. Her features too were almost faultless, and her countenance bespoke such youth that it seemed hardly possible she could be the mother of the babe. But she seemed not to notice their surprise and admiration, and when she was divested of her damp clothing she reached out her arms for the child, and turned towards the fire.</p> 
               <p>"Take a seat on the dye-tub, ma'am," said Nathan, rising; "it is the most comfortable spot in the house."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," replied the stranger, and she passed on and took the seat the young farmer had proffered.</p> 
               <p>"I will get you a cup of tea," said Mrs. Ashland;-"what shall I call your name?"</p> 
               <p>"Edna," said the visitor, slightly coloring.</p> 
               <p>"But you have another name, young woman, have you not?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you can call me Edna Benton;" and at that moment she seemed to be looking very earnestly at something on the hearth.</p> 
               <p>"Miss or Mrs.?" interrogated Mrs. Ashland; for her curiosity had now become excited, and she did not realize how inquisitive she was until she caught the reproving eye of her husband, who saw that the stranger seemed confused, and did not like to answer his wife's questions; so the hostess said no more, and soon a substantial meal was on the table, accompanied by a shining tea-pot filled with tea, the aromatic flavor of which told its quality. Edna-or, as the neighbors<pb n=""/> afterwards called her, Miss Benton-ate very sparingly of the food, and then asked for a cup of milk to feed her child. An hour later, all had retired to rest in the old farm-house, save Richard and Lucy, who sat before the fire on the settle, and listened to the moaning of the wind and the beating of the waves.</p> 
               <p>"Who can she be?" said Lucy, as she laid her hand in that of the handsome sailor.</p> 
               <p>"I was thinking of the same thing," replied he; "but, whoever she is, it is very evident she don't want to tell, so I think it is too bad to question her; but it does seem to me that I have seen her before, though I cannot say where or when."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it was in some foreign country, when you used to go to sea."</p> 
               <p>"It might have been, Lucy;-but is n't she handsome?"</p> 
               <p>Lucy pouted a little as the fear of a rival crossed her heart, and she attempted to seat herself at the other end of the settle.</p> 
               <p>"Not so fast, my little sea-nymph!" said Richard, as he gently drew her back to his side, and placed his arm around her waist. "If she is beautiful, you are more beautiful still; so don't get vexed with poor Jack because he gives one of your sex a compliment." And then he smoothed back her soft brown hair from her temples, and kissed her cheek, for the farmer's daughter was the idol of his heart.</p> 
               <p>"It is strange," she said, "that this woman should so interest us all; for we see strangers every day as they come and go to cross the ferry, and to-morrow morning she will go, and we may never hear of her again."</p> 
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5991-00000012"/> 
               <p>"Very probably," said Richard; "but it is strange that her companion did not come in and see that she was provided for." And so he and Lucy talked until the fire grew dim upon the hearth and the frost thickened on the windows; and then, with a good-night kiss, they separated, and went to their respective rooms.</p>

               <p>WHEN morning dawned the storm had ceased, but the waves rolled and foamed with such force that Mr. Ashland thought it not prudent to venture out upon the bay until the effects of the wind had somewhat subsided. It was the farmer's custom to let no one in his house remain in bed, neither in summer nor winter, until the sun had risen; so, when the first rays of light made their appearance in the east, his voice was always heard from the stairway arousing the sleepers, and setting the example he wished all to follow. Lucy quickly responded to her father's call, and, with the elastic spring of health, was soon bounding from room to room, a song upon her lips, and a rosy flush upon her cheeks, as she performed her morning avocations. When each one left his chamber, he knew his part: Richard attended to the boat, and Nathan went to the barn-yard and returned with brimming pails of sweet and foaming milk; Lucy busied herself in helping her mother prepare the tempting breakfast for the household; in<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5991-00000013"/> short, all performed cheerfully their allotted tasks, for at the homestead an idler was a being despised.</p> 
               <p>"Has our guest arisen?" said Mr. Ashland to his wife, as he came in from the yard.</p> 
               <p>"Not yet," she replied, as she arose and pushed from her the tall oaken churn; "for she looked so weary last night I thought best not to hurry her. But here, John, take hold of the dasher a few moments, and see if you can bring the butter, and I will go now and speak to her."</p> 
               <p>The farmer took a seat on the dye-tub and drew the churn between his knees, and, as the strokes of the dasher echoed up the spacious chimney, he commenced singing his favorite hymn, which ended with the words, "His loving kindness, His loving kindness, O, how free!"</p> 
               <p>When Mrs. Ashland came to the door that opened into the large square chamber over the <emph>great room,</emph> she gave a gentle rap, but no answer was returned; so she cautiously entered, and went to the side of the bed. The child lay close to the side of its protector, with one little hand buried in her curls, and the other clasped in the hand of the woman; both seemed sleeping; the babe rested quietly, for as yet the brain had not enlarged sufficiently to comprehend the sorrows of life. But the elder of the two sighed; and when the kind-hearted hostess tried to awaken her, with reason but half aroused, she sprang from the pillow, screaming, "O, Charles, Charles! save me and the boy! They are taking us back--" And then, as the effort brought consciousness, she sank back beside the child,<pb n=""/> and, pressing his little form more closely, burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Be quiet, child," said Mrs. Ashland, as she looked into the youthful face of the stranger. "There are none near you but friends, and no harm will befall you here."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, I know it," repeated Edna, endeavoring to compose herself; "but I had such a dreadful dream that I forgot where I was."</p> 
               <p>"O, if it was only a dream, child, you need n't mind it. I suppose being so tired, and sleeping in a strange place, made you have a bad dream; so you get right up, and I will take your baby down stairs and dress him. Why, he seems a good deal bigger than I thought he was last night. How old is he?"</p> 
               <p>"Two years," answered Edna, who strove to appear calm.</p> 
               <p>"Well, he is a fine little fellow," continued Mrs. Ashland; "if we had him here, we should make a great pet of him, for we all love children dearly. We had old Prue's little nigger baby here a few weeks in harvest-time, while his father and mother were at work for us; and after they left Lucy said she was so lonesome that she wanted us to adopt it." Edna smiled through her tears as the comical idea presented itself of Mrs. Ashland's adopting a colored baby, when there were so many of her own hue that would be glad to share the home of the rich farmer's family. "Now you hurry down," continued the kind-hearted woman, "for breakfast is all on the table; and, if you are going over in the boat by and by, you will want to stay your stomach so as not to be sea-sick." And she took the little boy<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5991-00000014"/> in her arms, who laughed and clasped his hands around her neck, as if accustomed to strangers. And then she closed the chamber door, and went to the kitchen, where the different members of the family were assembling to join in the morning meal.</p> 
               <p>"What a handsome boy!" said the farmer, as he let fall the dasher for the last time, and spattered the buttermilk over his gray homespun pantaloons. "Would you like to be a farmer, my little sonny?" and he reached out his hard, brown hand, and patted the child's head.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," lisped the child, who seemed to be forward beyond his years.</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, we will ask your mother to leave you here," continued the farmer.-"But here, wife, sit on the dye-tub, and keep the little fellow warm while you are putting his clothes on;" and he arose and resigned his seat. When Edna came in, the little Frederick was dressed in a short scarlet frock of woollen, and a pair of polished gaiters over white, home-knit stockings.</p> 
               <p>"Who is your shoemaker?" said Nathan, as he took the little stranger and let him stand on the palms of his broad hands.</p> 
               <p>"What do you ask him that for, Nathan?" said Richard, as he was passing and heard the remark.</p> 
               <p>"So as to find out; because, you see, old Silas Wright don't make such shiny ones, and I don't believe they were made around in these parts."</p> 
               <p>"Hush!" said Richard, as he saw the child's companion turning from the window where she had been looking off on the water, and watching the movements of a large ship that was beating her way out to sea.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>
                  <figure> </figure>
               </p> 
               <p>"I think it an't much more harm to speak than it is to think!" muttered Nathan; and then, going up to Edna, he handed her the child. She took it, and, turning to Mr. Ashland, inquired how long before the boat would leave the shore for the town on the opposite side of the bay.</p> 
               <p>"There will be a lull about nine o'clock, I think, and then we can start; but last night's storm was so severe that the waves run very high yet." The farmer wondered why she was in such haste, but he said nothing more, and all took their seats at the table.</p> 
               <p>When breakfast was ended the guest again took a seat by the window, and seemed to be lost to all that<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5991-00000015"/> was going on around her. The young men went out to their labors; and when the ordinary in-doors work was accomplished Lucy drew her spinning-wheel before the fire, and resumed her labor of yesterday, while old Prue,-as the neighbors called her,-who had come down to spend the day, and card wool into rolls for the farmer's daughter, was seated in the corner, alternately talking and carding, and singing now and then a verse of the hymns she had learned from those who could read.</p> 
               <p>"You're a real handsome child," said Prue, as the little Frederick came to her side, and took hold of a corner of the red cotton handkerchief that was tied around her head. "Who is that?" she inquired, as she drew him nearer, and pointed to the stranger at the window.</p> 
               <p>"Lizzie," said the child.</p> 
               <p>"What do you want, darling?" said Edna, turning quickly; and then, as she remembered where she was, a deep blush suffused her features, and she called the boy to her and took him in her lap, as if to prevent any more questions being asked; while Prue gave Mrs. Ashland a knowing look, as much as to say, "I'd soon find out who she is."</p> 
               <p>In a few moments Edna took a gold watch from a side pocket, and looked at the hour. "We must be getting ready now, Freddy," she said, "for it is nearly nine, and I see some one making preparations for the boat to start."</p> 
               <p>Lucy laid down the little wheelpin that kept the spindle buzzing and turning, and, going to her side, took the child. The stranger willingly gave him up,<pb n=""/> with a look that seemed filled with gratitude for the attentions she received. When she was dressed in her warm travelling-suit, with many thanks to the farmer's family, a pleasant remark to Prue, and a polite good-by to all, she took her way to the boat, accompanied by Nathan, who carried her small basket and the babe.</p> 
               <p>"I wish you'd leave this little chap with us, ma'am," said Nathan, as they were proceeding to the pier: "we'd take first-rate care of him; and I think, with the right sort of training, he'd make a pretty smart lad."</p> 
               <p>"I could n't part with my child," replied the traveller.</p> 
               <p>"Then he is yours, ma'am? Well, I don't think it's best to be too private. I hate secrets, and, for my part, I generally tell what I know; so I'll go right in and tell Mrs. Ashland and Lucy that you told me this little fellow was yours,-so I suppose you 're his mother, an't you?"</p> 
               <p>The stranger gave him such a look that he pursued his inquiries no further, but walked in silence to the sloop, where he handed her her basket and the child, and then sat down on the rock to watch the little vessel as she pitched and rolled in the troughs of the sea. Half an hour after, she looked like a speck upon the waters, and then disappeared, as she rounded a small island, a part of which lay nearly opposite. Then Nathan, rising, buried his hands in his spacious pockets, and sauntered up the pathway to the house.</p> 
               <p>"Why don't you go out and help the men-folks lay the stone wall, down in the short meadow?" said Prue, as Nathan entered and was about to take his<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5991-00000016"/> favorite seat on the dye-tub; "by and by you 'll want your dinner, and it won't be paid for."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I was going to, when I met that young woman at the door, and I thought I 'd take her things down to the boat for her; and now I want to get a little warm before I go to work. But, don't you think, Prue, she called that little chap her child; and then I asked her if she was his mother, and she gave me such a look, that I thought of old Mr. Tower, the schoolmaster, how he used to look at the boys when they 'd been up to some mischief. There is some secret about her, and I hate secrets.</p> 
               <p>"Well, never mind, Nathan; she is gone now. If she is a good creetur, it'll all be right at the latter day; and if she is bad, you nor I can't help it,-the worst is her own."</p> 
               <p>"There it is, Prue! You always fall to preaching about what you don't understand."</p> 
               <p>"Don't I, Mr. Nathan Fossett? Have n't I been to meeting for more than twenty years, and heard every word Elder Demmon said? You think, because Prue can't read, she don't know anything; but I tell you, Nathan, God larns in other ways besides books, and there is more than me that can't read, and yet loves God, and tries to keep his commandments." And Prue gathered up the folds of her linsey-woolsey gown, that the increasing heat of the fire might not scorch it, and with her cards manufactured the rolls with such rapidity that there was no fear of the spinning-wheel's stopping for the lack of capital. Nathan felt rebuked by the words of the negress, and soon set forth for the meadow.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Perhaps it would be well here to give the reader a short sketch of Prue, and explain why she was so well received and so familiar in the farmer's family. Prue's mother drew her first breath under the roof that now sheltered Mr. Ashland; she was born a slave, and continued in bondage until after the birth of Prue. When Mr. Ashland's father died, it was found in his will that all his slaves were presented with their freedom, beside a certain amount of money and clothing to each, and to his son, the present proprietor, was given the homestead. Tafty, the mother of Prue, did not avail herself of her freedom, but preferred to remain on the farm with her young master and his mother. Prue and the farmer's son were near of an age, and at evening, when the day's toil was over, it was the custom at the farm-house, in the summer time, for the younger members of the family, without distinction of color, to gather about the door and beneath the shadow of the spreading branches of the oak, and pass away the hours in conversation, and those amusements that pleased them best. At the time of which we write the sod had grown green on the grave of Tafty, which was marked by a rough stone, in the family enclosure, on the brow of the hill. Had Prue lived in these days, and spent a few years at the Oberlin Institute, she would have been one of the foremost of her race, in point of intellect. But, although she was not versed in the lore of books, she was often appealed to for information where it required judgment to decide; and so correct did her decisions usually prove, that it became a proverb among the neighbors, when any one wished for knowledge on domestic matters, "We will<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5991-00000017"/> ask Prue." If a child got burnt, within miles around, the skilful negress was sure to be there with bandages and her horn of liniment. And if a sturdy neighbor, weakened by age or toil, was laid low and helpless, the same messenger that brought the physician generally brought Prue seated behind in the little wagon. And in the fall of the year, when poultry was to be picked and got ready for market, the swine slaughtered, and the cloth prepared for the fulling-mill, none could make themselves more useful than Prue; and so, since she had married the industrious Cudjoe, they were welcome guests among the neighboring farmers' families. By honest toil and prudent savings, they had become possessors of a small cottage, with a garden attached; this, with the presents and payments they received from those who employed them, was sufficient to enable them to live independent and happy. They once had a numerous family of children, but death had deprived them of all save Sammy, the child that Lucy Ashland wished her parents to adopt. He was the youngest. Stormy and cold must be the Sabbath that would keep the old couple from attending the little church upon the hill, where the pious Prue, with memory unclogged, would treasure every word that was spoken by the good man, as he leaned over the low pine pulpit, and, with trembling voice, told of the fearful doom of the sinner, and the glorious prospect of the Christian. Prue and her husband heard, believed, and worshipped.</p>

               <p>DAY had again drawn to a close at the homestead, and the fowls had sought repose on the peak of the corn-crib, and among the slender boughs of the brush-heap that fringed the farmer's wood-pile. All living objects within Mr. Ashland's domain were well provided with food and shelter. The table was spread temptingly with the smoking corn-cake and sweet butter,-with the quivering Indian pudding and sage cheese. The clouds of the previous night had been rent asunder, and their contents were congealed on the earth below. Reader, did you ever spend a frosty November night in the country, when icicles glistened in the moonbeams, and Jack was busy with his frosty breath bespangling the windows and ornament-<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5991-00000018"/> ing the limbs of the sturdy oak? If you have, you can appreciate the scene that surrounded the home of the Ashland family. Supper was over, and Prue, with her broad check apron filled with apples, had returned to her cottage and Cudjoe, to rehearse, with a genuine love of harmless gossip, the events of the day.</p> 
               <p>"Has the boat come in for the last time?" inquired Mr. Ashland of his daughter, as he slowly walked the sanded floor of his spacious kitchen.</p> 
               <p>"No, sir," said Lucy, who stood by the window, looking out on the water, "but I think she has just rounded the island, and is on her way to the pier. It is so dark that I can't make her out for a certainty, for she looks almost like a white-winged gull, on the water."</p> 
               <p>"Let me see," said Nathan, stepping to her side; and, with his face touching the panes of glass, and his hands pressed close to his temples, he peered through the mist that arose from the water. "It is the Swallow," he added, "for I should know the little craft, if I saw only the tip of her bowsprit." He glanced through his fingers, to see if the farmer were looking that way; and, seeing that he had just turned slowly around, and was going towards the fire, where Mrs. Ashland sat by the light-stand, with her back towards them, he took hold of the hem of Lucy's Vandyke,<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="WRIGHT2-0464A-NOTE001" n="*"
                        place="foot">
                     <p >Small round cape.</p>
                  </note> that she might not suddenly leave him, for it was not very often that he could get an opportunity to be so near and speak with her. Lucy made a slight effort to break away but he would not<pb n=""/> let her go, and she did not like to attract the attention of her parents, for she thought Nathan was more of a favorite with them than Richard; so she kept her place at the window, as the young man whispered, "What makes you think so much of Richard Conworth, when you know that he is a stranger, and he says himself that he has nothing but his hands to depend on in the future?"</p> 
               <p>Lucy's lip trembled, and at first she thought she would not speak to him; but he still retained his hold, and she answered, "If he had not an honest heart, he would not have acknowledged his poverty."</p> 
               <p>"Some, Lucy, might take that way to make you think them honest. How do you know but he has been a pirate? for he often talks of the past, and speaks of the time when he sailed off Matanzas and among the Spanish islands."</p> 
               <p>"Richard a pirate!" repeated Lucy, in a hoarse whisper, with her dark blue eye flashing like the lightning of a sultry summer night,-"Never!"</p> 
               <p>"Lucy, child," interrupted her mother, "don't stand there, doing nothing! Come here and turn the short-cake, for there may be some passengers in the boat who will want to stay all night; so you can get things ready, and then, if they don't make use of them, a short-cake never comes amiss."</p> 
               <p>Nathan let go his hold, and Lucy turned away, without finishing her sentence, or again looking into his face, and, kneeling in front of the glowing coals, raised the large round pewter plate, that held the domestic rye-flour cake, and turned the brown side upward. This task being finished, she attempted to rise from her posi-<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5991-00000019"/> tion; but Nathan, who had resumed his seat on the dye-tub, pressed the tip of his heavy boot on the gore of her bright-plaided linsey-woolsey, and kept her where she was. This he did, not so much to annoy her, as to see if he had vexed her so that she would not look up into his face and smile. But when he saw her turn her eyes towards her father, as if she were about to speak, he withdrew the impediment to her rising, and apologized for the <emph>accident.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>"You had better go out, Nathan, and help Richard a little in making the boat fast and unloading," said the farmer, "for I suppose neighbor Allen is aboard with his horse and wagon; he went over to town to-day with a load of cabbages, and one thing and another."</p> 
               <p>"I will, sir," answered the young man, respectfully, and he arose and drew his cap low over his forehead, and went out. In a few moments the sloop swept gracefully up to the side of the pier, and Richard sprang from her side to the landing, and coiled a rope around a post that was firmly set for the purpose. Nathan walked leisurely along until he reached the spot where Richard was employed, and then he folded his arms and stood looking on, without offering to aid.</p> 
               <p>"Bear a hand here, Nathan, will you?" said Richard, as he strained every muscle to keep back the boat, which had run in a little too far, and was in danger of going against the rocks.</p> 
               <p>"I am no sailor, Dick," he replied stoically, without unfolding his arms, and wishing in his heart that the boat might be injured, and the blame fall upon Richard.</p> 
               <p>"Well, <emph>I am,</emph>" returned the other, giving a con-<pb n=""/> temptuous glance at the unaccommodating landsman; "so, out of the way, you lubber, or in keeping the sloop clear of the rocks I may run afoul of you!"</p> 
               <p>"I choose to stand where I am," replied Nathan, compressing his lips, and planting his feet more firmly on the oaken planks.</p> 
               <p>"You may, boy," said the sailor, sarcastically; "for the boat is safe now, and I want none of your assistance;" and he passed on to help out the passengers, and remove the baggage from the cuddy.</p> 
               <p>For a moment Nathan's face was pale with rage; but, on looking more particularly at the sloop as the sail was reefed closer, he saw that there was a female on board; so he strove to appear as if his feelings were unruffled, and he stepped to the side and offered her his arm.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," she replied, "I wish for no assistance; but, if you will be kind enough to take my boy, you will oblige me."</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly," replied Nathan; and, as he extended his arms for the child, he observed that they were the same passengers that crossed the ferry in the morning. He said nothing more, but, taking the child, walked quickly up the path, followed by the stranger. "Here, Lucy," he said, reaching the child towards her, to see if he could gain a smile, "you know you love children,-even Prue's little Sammy."</p> 
               <p>"I love children," said the girl, "because there is no deceit about them;" and she looked into Nathan's face so earnestly that the young man dropped his eyes, and tried to believe that there was no ulterior meaning to her words.</p> 
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5991-00000020"/> 
               <p>At this moment Edna entered, and, looking pleasantly towards the farmer and his wife, said,</p> 
               <p>"I suppose you did not expect me to return so soon; but, as I did not cross the ferry last night, it was too late to-to-"</p> 
               <p>"Where farver?" interrupted the child.</p> 
               <p>Edna bowed her head, and seemed to be very busy arranging his hair; and then she put her lips to his ear, and whispered something so low that it was heard only by the one for whom it was intended.</p> 
               <p>"Me will," lisped the boy.</p> 
               <p>The stranger had taken a seat by the fire, and removed the child's hood, but she had not laid aside her own outer garments.</p> 
               <p>"Won't you take off your mantle and bonnet?" said Mrs. Ashland, going to her side.</p> 
               <p>"Can I stay here again, to-night?" said the stranger, rather timidly.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, certainly," replied the kind-hearted housekeeper, at the same time casting a look across the hearth to her husband, to see if he approved her answer.</p> 
               <p>"We never did refuse any person, if he were decent and respectable-looking," said the farmer, "and we have kept this ferry a long time."</p> 
               <p>"Would you like some supper, Miss--, Miss--" said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"Benton," interrupted the traveller; and then continued, "I would like something to eat, for I have not tasted of any food since I left here this morning;" and she looked up into the hostess' face so beseechingly that the kind matron involuntarily exclaimed,</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Poor, child! you had n't ought to be travelling about with no one to help take care of you and your baby. And has n't he had anything either?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Edna, "I bought something for him, but I have not been hungry till now."</p> 
               <p>"Well, you shan't be hungry long;" and Mrs. Ashland hastened to assist Lucy to prepare a comfortable meal for their guest. In the mean time Freddy slid down from the stranger's lap, and made himself perfectly at home by climbing on Mr. Ashland's knee, and trying to pull off the large horn buttons that ornamented his coat; but, as the home-manufactured linen thread held them too strongly, he abandoned that amusement, and, with the farmer's assistance, climbed higher, and twined his little dimpled arms around his neck, and laid his soft cheek against the brown temples of Mr. Ashland, laughing and chattering in language that was perfectly unintelligible to the one he caressed.</p> 
               <p>"Your little one is used to strangers, I guess," said the farmer, looking at the traveller.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he is," she replied, rather abstractedly.</p> 
               <p>"Well, if he was n't, it would be all the same," said Mrs. Ashland, "for I never saw a child yet that did n't take to my husband. Even little Sammy, with his little woolly head, will trot after him, when he goes up the road past there, and beg him to bring him home to live with him."</p> 
               <p>"And perhaps I shall, some day, for I think there is nothing like little children running and singing about the house, to make it look lively. Lucy used to be a sprightly little thing once, but she has got kind of out of the way now, and thinks more of going to<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5991-00000021"/> quiltings and paring-bees than of staying at home and amusing her old father and mother; but I won't mind that, so long as she won't have anything to say to the lads."</p> 
               <p>This was quite a joke for the farmer to perpetrate, for he was generally rather serious in his manner, and it began to appear as if the playful mood of the child were contagious. The young girl's under lip projected a little for a moment, and then she gave a bashful glance to the back part of the room, where Richard was standing and surveying the group around the fire. A smile wreathed the face of the young man as he heard the last remark, and, seeing Lucy's confusion, he burst into a low, smothered laugh. She felt that the best way to send the blood back from her face would be to seek the frosty air, and accordingly she made an errand out into the milk-room, and did not return until Richard, Edna, and her child, were all seated at the table, partaking of the rye-flour cake, with other substantial viands, the products of the farm. The young sailor had drained his tea-cup for the last time, and the stranger's appetite was decreasing, when some one gave a loud rap at the front door.</p> 
               <p>"Come in," said Mr. Ashland, in a loud tone; for in the olden time, when the latch-string was out, or the door unbarred, no one thought of rising to receive a visitor until he had entered. In a moment the outside door was thrown open, and the right-hand inner door, which was in close proximity, standing ajar, revealed the inmates of the kitchen. Without looking up, Edna arose from the table, and drew her chair nearer the fire, while a tall, well-proportioned<pb n=""/> man entered, and, walking into the centre of the room, inquired if he could remain there that night, as he would like to take the first boat over in the morning. As the stranger spoke, Edna looked around and turned very pale; then, rising, she went to the window, and seemed to be looking out on the water.</p> 
               <p>"Why, why, why!" said little Freddy, unclasping his arms from the old house-dog's neck, where he had been lying and rolling since he left the supper-table, which was some time before the others. As soon as he could steady himself on his feet, he ran to the new comer, and asked to be taken up. At first the traveller did not appear to notice him; but, as the farmer commented on what a smart boy he was, and how little fear he seemed to entertain for strangers, and that in many things he seemed two or three years older than he really was, he stooped and raised him to his lips and kissed him, nor when he took a seat by the fire did he put him from his knee.</p> 
               <p>"Me love you," lisped the boy; "me love farver."</p> 
               <p>"I am not your father," said the stranger, "but perhaps I look like him."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ashland, "it must be something of the kind, for it is plain he thinks he has seen you before." And she adjusted her spectacles, to see if there were any resemblance between the child and the stranger; but she could discover none, either in look or manner. The child had dark-blue eyes and light flaxen curls, while the stranger's eyes were black and piercing, and his hair the hue of the raven's wing, his form tall and majestic, and his whole bearing bespoke<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5991-00000022"/> a firmness that could resist, if placed where resistance was necessary.</p> 
               <p>"Shall I occupy the same room to-night that I did last night?" inquired Edna of Lucy, as she stood by her side, and passed some remarks on the ice-crowned rocks as they glittered in the moonlight.</p> 
               <p>"I'll see," answered Lucy; and then, turning to her mother, she said, "Will Miss Benton occupy the square chamber on the left as you go up the stairs?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Ashland; "and you may prepare the one at the right hand for this gentleman."</p> 
               <p>"If you will be kind enough to give me a candle. I will retire now," said Edna.</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Lucy, and she stepped to the fireplace and reached up to the mantel, and presently returned to the window with a lighted candle, which Edna took, and, calling Freddy to her, wished all a good-evening, and left the room. After Miss Benton had gone up stairs, the stranger drew his chair rather nearer the farmer, and began to remark about his crops, stock, and the healthy location of the homestead. "Do you ever have any visitors here from the large towns, or do any come here from a distance to cross the ferry?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no," replied the farmer, "not very often. The ferry is chiefly for the farmers around in this vicinity; they come from away up by Tower Hill and Littlerest, and all round there, to go over to town to take their produce to market, and the women-folks go over there once in a while with baskets of eggs, and such-like, to buy a little finery. They are getting so now they begin to think the wool and flax raised on the farm not<pb n=""/> good enough, when it is spun and wove, to make aprons and gowns of. I don't know what it will all come to, by and by. There is Martha, my wife, sowed the flax-seed on her father's farm, and then spun and wove her wedding dress. Why, she never had a chintz calico dress until after she was married!"</p> 
               <p>"That is very true," said Mrs. Ashland. "I remember well the first dress you made me a present of. It was on the first anniversary of our marriage. You went over to town, and when you came back it was almost dark, and I was out in the barn-yard milking, and you came up softly behind me, and dropped it into my lap; and, O! how much I did think of that dress! It cost a pound and some odd shillings, and it was such a good thing to wear."</p> 
               <p>"Could n't help but wear well," said the farmer. "You never used to put it on unless of a Sunday, or when you were going over to town; but now Lucy thinks she must have a new one every little while."</p> 
               <p>"Do you ever have any travellers from Providence, or New York?" said the stranger, with a look that seemed to indicate a great deal of interest in the answer.</p> 
               <p>"O, no," replied Mr. Ashland. "This route would be entirely out of the way. If any one wanted to go to Newport from Providence, why, he has only to jump into a boat, and sail right down there. But it would be a long distance out of the way to take the stage-road and come here, and then cross the ferry. And as for New York, why, I guess you are a stranger here, to make such an inquiry." And the farmer looked up for a reply from the traveller, who merely bowed,<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5991-00000023"/> and said he never spent much time in New England, and then asked if he knew who that lady was with that interesting child.</p> 
               <p>"No," said the farmer, "I don't. She came here last night in that dreadful storm, and wanted to cross the ferry; but I told her I could not think of going over then, and, besides, we seldom go across the bay in the evening. She said something about its being too late this morning; but still I did n't go, and she staid here all night, and this morning about nine o'clock she went over with Richard, and I did n't expect her back again; but it seems she has come, and is going to stay over night, and I don't know what she intends to do in the morning, nor where she thinks of going. Do you, wife?"</p> 
               <p>"No, the poor child seems dreadful kind of cast down, and don't seem to want to say anything about herself or her boy."</p> 
               <p>"Well, there, you should n't ask her anything about it," said the farmer, looking towards Mrs. Ashland. "For I do think it is a great piece of ill-manners to inquire about other people's business, if they don't seem inclined to be communicative. But women-folks are always so curious to know all that is going on, that sometimes they forget what is due to hospitality."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland colored a little, as she replied, "As to your assertion about women-folks, husband, I think, if you had been here this morning, you would have thought differently; for there is not one in the house that manifests the curiosity that Nathan does, and I don't know but he would have spent the whole fore-<pb n=""/> noon here talking with Prue about it, if she had n't reminded him that he had better go to work."</p> 
               <p>The farmer smiled, and then cast his eyes around the room to see if Nathan were present; but, as he was not, he answered, "O, Nathan is a little curious, I know; but, after all, he is a pretty good sort of a boy, and seems very much interested about the farm; he likes to have everything go on right."</p> 
               <p>Lucy, who sat back of the stand, looked up from her work, and gave a pleasant but anxious glance towards Richard, who returned her look of love, and then let his eyes fall again on his book, while the farmer continued, "That is a beautiful boy she has. I told her she had better give him to me; for I have no son, and I would like to make a farmer of him."</p> 
               <p>"And pray, John, did you think she would give away her child?" said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"Well, no, but I thought, perhaps-well, I don't know what I did think; but, if she would give me the boy, I should be glad to take him."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose," said the stranger, who seemed very much interested in the conversation, "that she would let you have the child, provided that you let her stay too,-would you keep her?"</p> 
               <p>"Lucy and I would like that arrangement," said the farmer's wife. "For the work comes very hard on us, especially in summer, when we have so many employed on the farm, and it is very difficult to get girls to help; and as for old Prue, why, everybody wants her in the working season."</p> 
               <p>"I thought it was very easy to get help on the farms, and that if a farmer had two or three grown-up<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5991-00000024"/> daughters, he would let one or two of them hire out to a neighbor, and so assist each other."</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Mr. Ashland, "sometimes that is the case; but around here everybody seems to be well to do, and would rather keep their girls at home, and if there isn't enough for them to do, why, they take in spinning, or knit stockings, to take over to town to sell, or something of that kind. But, about that young woman; yes, I think I would take both of them."</p> 
               <p>And so the evening wore away, while Mr. Ashland and his wife conversed with their guest, and the younger members of the family sat and listened, but made no attempt to enter into the conversation. At length the stranger looked around towards the tall eight-day clock that stood in the corner, and said, if his room were ready, he would like to retire.</p> 
               <p>"Our rooms don't need much preparation," said the farmer. "A few good warm blankets on the bed and a patchwork quilt is about all a body needs, such weather as this."</p> 
               <p>The visitor smiled, and said that was enough for all those who, like himself, only sought comfort; and then Mr. Ashland reached him a lighted candle from the stand, and, going to the staircase that led up from the front entry, pointed to the door of the room the traveller was to occupy, and, bidding him good-night, they separated.</p> 
               <p>After the farmer had gone in and closed the kitchen door, he took a seat by the fire again, and then, looking at his wife, remarked, "That is a very sociable young man," and he was just going to say he wondered who he was, and where he came from; but he remembered<pb n=""/> the rebuke he had given to inquisitiveness, so he only said he supposed he would leave them again in the morning. Then, taking off his boots, he sat with his feet to the fire a few moments, and then stepped into the bedroom adjoining the kitchen, and was soon soundly sleeping between the warm blankets of his bed. In a little while Mrs. Ashland retired, saying to her daughter that she had better not sit up much longer, as she could finish the garment she was making to-morrow, and perhaps their guests might want breakfast before they left, and she should require her help quite early. Lucy replied she would not sit long, and, as the latch of the sleeping-room door fell, Richard closed his book, and, leaving his chair, took a seat on the dye-tub, and drew Lucy to his knee; then, looking around to make sure they were alone, he said, "Lucy, dear girl, if you were not here, I wouldn't stay another day."</p> 
               <p>The farmer's daughter bowed her head, and gazed vacantly into the almost lifeless embers on the stone hearth; but she made no answer, and he continued, "It is hard to tell whether Nathan Fossett loves you or your father's farm the most; but there is one thing certain,-he means to have both, and it is my firm belief that he cares not what measures he takes, so that the end is accomplished. Now, Lucy, I have no objection to his having the farm, if your parents are willing; but I would rather be hung in a gibbet until the winds sweep away my flesh than to see Nathan embrace you as his own,-unless it be your choice, which I never will believe without I hear it from your own lips."</p> 
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5991-00000025"/> 
               <p>"I love Nathan!" said the fair girl; "<emph>never!</emph> Narraganset Bay should sooner become my grave than I would be his wife; for I think there is no deed too dark for him to perpetrate, in order to gain an object he desired."</p> 
               <p>"Spoken like yourself, dear girl; but your father does not think so. It is plain Nathan is his favorite, and, come what will, he never attaches any blame to him."</p> 
               <p>"That is true now, Richard; but father will not always be so; for, should he find out one wrong action against him, he would be on the alert to discover more. And, once knowing his character, he might forgive, but he never could forget, and Nathan would be employed by him no more."</p> 
               <p>"God grant the time may soon come; for I could not bear forever from him as much as I have done within the last year." And then he told her of Nathan's aggravating conduct on the pier, and that his expression showed plainly that he secretly wished the Swallow might be dashed in pieces against the rocks, when a slight effort on his part would prevent an occurrence so ruinous. Lucy did not tell her lover the insinuations Nathan had made that evening ere he went out as her father directed, for she could not bear to wound his feelings further; and she wisely resolved to keep the interview to herself, and do all she could to convince Nathan that she never could encourage him, and that it was useless for him to expect his suit ever to be successful.</p> 
               <p>For some moments the young sailor and Lucy sat silent; but at length she said, timidly, as if fearing<pb n=""/> she might awake unpleasant reflections, "Do you suppose you will ever ascertain who your parents are?"</p> 
               <p>"Not until the grave gives up its dead, Lucy; for I have cruised in all latitudes to try to find out who gave me birth, but I am no wiser now than when I was picked up on the sea-shore by the fisherman's wife, surrounded by the dead, and clasped to the bosom of a lifeless female."</p> 
               <p>"Was there nothing washed ashore by which you could gain some clue to the place you were from, or your destination?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing; nothing save an old sea-chest that held a few sailor-clothes, which David, the fisherman, appropriated to himself; and Aunt Betsey, his wife, long ago converted the chest into ashes. When I was a boy, I used to follow Uncle David down to the shore, and sit upon the rocks and watch, hoping to see a ship approach to convey me away; for I felt that all the relatives I had did not perish in that vessel that stranded on the rocks, and they would come to see if any were saved from the wreck. Then, after a long, lonely watch, I would go down again, and roam along the sandy beach below, and look into every crevice among the stunted shrubbery, to see if there were not some relic hidden in an unfrequented spot whereby I might prove my identity, if ever opportunity offered. But these were boyish thoughts, and I remained in the fisherman's hut, and attended the village school some two miles distant, until I was old enough to go to sea. Since then, my life has been one of industry, hardship, and study."</p> 
               <p>"But, Richard, by what miracle do you suppose you<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5991-00000026"/> were saved, when she who clasped you in her arms was dead?"</p> 
               <p>"I know not, Lucy; but Uncle David said that he presumed, when the ship went to pieces, she, with me in her arms, well wrapped in woollens, clung to a fragment of the wreck, and was swept inland to the shore. Having been, as it seemed, unmindful of her own safety, and being scantily clothed, she perished with the cold. The tide receded, and left us there, with several other sufferers, who had met their death while battling with the waves."</p> 
               <p>"But it seems to me that David Conworth might have saved something that was on the body of her who protected you; it might have been useful at some period of your life, should you be fortunate enough to meet with some one who knew anything of the former history of the ill-fated vessel and her living freight."</p> 
               <p>"Such thoughts have often been mine; but Uncle David and his wife, though kind-hearted, were very ignorant, and thought little of these things; and, if they saved anything from the bodies of the dead, it was in atoms long before I was old enough to appreciate its worth."</p> 
               <p>"How old were you, Richard, when the fisherman found you on the shore?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know; but Uncle David said he should judge me to be about three or four years old."</p> 
               <p>"And can you remember nothing before the storm at sea? I can remember many things that transpired as far back as my fourth year."</p> 
               <p>"And so could I, Lucy, if I had always remained in a quiet home, and never left the spot where I spent<pb n=""/> my infancy and childhood. But I do seem to have a confused idea of-of--O! I can remember nothing now. There have been too many scenes and changes since I was taken from the icy embrace of-probably my mother. I may be a relative of England's king, born beneath a roof where dazzled courtly splendor; or I may have drawn my first breath in some lone peasant's cot, where the wintry winds swept over scenes of poverty and destitution, the rehearsal of which would chill the blood; or I may be the child of parents who were fleeing their country to escape the scaffold, or the deep dungeons of the Old Bailey."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Richard; I will not believe your last conjecture. One so noble could not have owed his life to, nor drawn his first food from, a wicked mother. Poor she might have been, but criminal never!"</p> 
               <p>"God bless you, Lucy, for those words! They throw a warm ray of love and sunshine around my heart, and melt the frigid sensations which none but the friendless and homeless can ever know." And, pressing the lovely girl to his bosom, he continued, "I care not now where I was born, nor by what circumstances I was surrounded, if I but feel that you return one half the love I bear you; that and health are all I ask for now. In America none need lack for bread, and the comforts of life; and yet-"</p> 
               <p>The young man did not finish the sentence; for his lips quivered, and his cheeks turned pale, as there flashed across his mind how absurd was the idea that the shrewd, calculating Farmer Ashland would ever consent to let his daughter become the wife of a penniless wanderer. And, when he recovered his firmness<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5991-00000027"/> so far as to mention his fears, Lucy could speak no words of comfort, except the assurance that, come what might, her heart would still be his, and she would never wed another. And so they parted, each to muse on the uncertain future.</p>

               <p>WHEN Nathan had returned from the pier, and finished the few remaining duties that came within his allotted labor, his mind was too active to enjoy the conversation of the fireside circle, and he went out into the frosty air, to walk along the pebbly beach about half a mile distant, and take a retrospect of the past, and lay plans for the future. He had not long walked to and fro on the lonely shore, crushing the thin sea-shells with his heavy tread, and each moment becoming more perplexed as to what his future course should be, when he was joined by a companion.</p> 
               <p>"What is the matter, to-night, my boy?" he said, approaching cautiously, and laying his hand on Nathan's shoulder.</p> 
               <p>"Nothing new, George. I am thinking of what you have heard me talk about before now," returned Nathan, stopping and looking him full in the face.</p> 
               <p>"Richard and the farmer's daughter," said George, with a low, hoarse laugh; and then continued, "you<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5991-00000028"/> don't understand your business, or you would have had him out of the way before this."</p> 
               <p>"How, George?"</p> 
               <p>"O, the Narraganset is broad and deep, and the dagger's point is keen!"</p> 
               <p>"No, George, I own I am too much of a coward to try such means; but, if his life were in danger, I would not step one pace aside to save it; for I hate him as I never hated mortal before!"</p> 
               <p>"And have you any other cause for hate, except that Lucy favors him more than yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"No;-<emph>no,</emph> did I say? Yes, yes, I have other cause; I hate him for his cold, sarcastic manner, and the proud bearing he ever carries towards me. If he were the son of a nobleman, he could not assume more dignity than he does when I try to make him realize he is only an unknown adventurer."</p> 
               <p>"And did Lucy encourage you ere he came to the homestead?"</p> 
               <p>"Lucy never said she loved me; but she was a different girl then, and always spoke kindly to me, and sometimes would sit and talk with me. But since Richard came there are no such hours for me, and he is the cause of it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, Nathan," returned the other, "never mind now, but go up to the old hut, and let us have a mug of cider together, or something more exciting, if you will, and a game of cards, and then we can talk over this affair. I left a good fire blazing up the old stone chimney, for I expected you would meet me there to-night, and came over from the town a little earlier than usual. I have n't seen Ben lately, and I<pb n=""/> should n't wonder if he had got brought up somewhere. I am afraid he is n't sharp enough for you and me to associate with."</p> 
               <p>"How did you come over?" inquired Nathan, not seeming to notice his last remark.</p> 
               <p>"O, I borrowed a sail-boat from Captain Orton, to go off in the vicinity of the Dumplings, and see if I could n't haul in a few tautogs; but I am thinking I shan't be successful enough to give the old man a mess of fish to pay for his boat."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps a sheep would do as well," said Nathan, with a low laugh; and then he passed his hand through the other's arm, and they both took their way up from the beach towards what seemed to be a dense forest, and in a moment their forms had disappeared where the eye could not discover them from the beach, nor from the cleared ground beyond. They had not gone far when Nathan dropped the arm of his companion, for the foot-path grew more intricate, and was finally lost in the low underbrush; yet they seemed to move on as if acquainted with the way. Now and then they would climb over the trunk of some giant tree that the woodman's axe had laid low; and they walked on until they came to a low hut, the exterior of which was black and smoky, giving evidence that it had been occupied by a coal-burner, and deserted ere these young men had chosen it as a place to while away leisure hours, and plan deeds which, had they been known to Farmer Ashland, would have made plain to him from whence came many of his losses. The ground for several rods beyond the hut was black, and here and there were fragments of charred coal, showing that it had been<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5991-00000029"/> many months, perhaps years, since the collier had used the hut or ground; for on the latter, when the sun lighted up the forest, could be seen around and within the blackened spot small tufts of stunted grass, which beneath the summer's sky had assumed its natural hue since the burner's fire had blackened the place.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan and George reached the hut, the latter stepped to the entrance and drew aside a coarse, rough piece of bunting, and then looked cautiously in, as if he feared another might have entered since he left; but, seeing nothing but what he had left there a short time previous, he entered, and held the cloth back for his comrade to follow. The only furniture consisted of a long rough board, constructed into a low bench, and a small square table, made of quite as rough material; in the corner, at the right of the entrance, was a small chest, its sides and top covered with just enough green paint to make it known that the art of painting had been discovered. Several small chestnut logs were piled up against the back of the rough stone chimney; and in front of these large sticks of oak, laid on small flat stones, were blazing and lighting up the large fireplace, making plain the somewhat curious hieroglyphics that had been drawn on the jambs, with pieces of charred coal, by the lonely watcher of the coal-pit, partly to try its merit, and partly to beguile the tedium of the hours that he was shut out from human intercourse while overlooking the process of making charcoal. Nathan drew the rough bench close to the fire, while his companion went to the green chest, and, drawing a key from his pocket, soon unfastened the padlock, and took out a junk-bottle that was filled to the<pb n=""/> stopper; then, opening the till in the end of the chest, he drew forth a pack of cards, and went back to the fireplace. Seating himself on the bench beside Nathan, he took down a pewter porringer which had hung against the jamb, and, drawing the cork from the bottle with his strong teeth, filled it, and handed it to his companion. "There, drink that, my boy," said George, as he rested the bottle on the tip of his knee, and waited to have the porringer returned; "it will warm your heart, and cheer you, and make you think less of the farmer's daughter; for I am inclined to believe that if you should come over to town to search for a wife, you would find as handsome girls there as Lucy Ashland."</p> 
               <p>"Well," answered Nathan, passing back the empty vessel, "if it were not for the Ashland farm, and the old homestead, with all the stock, and so forth, why, Lucy might marry Richard Conworth as soon as she liked; but I have set my mind on that old homestead, and I will play a deep game but that I will have it." Saying this, he extended his hand for another porringer full of the contents of the bottle, which was given him, and when that was drained they drew up the table, and began to prepare for a game of cards.</p> 
               <p>"There is your portrait, George," said Nathan, holding up the jack of spades; "you see it is the blackest knave in the pack."</p> 
               <p>"And there is yours," retorted the other, drawing out the jack of clubs; "but, come, boy, what do you play for?-money or sport? I am prepared for either."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I an't," said Nathan; "for my funds are low,<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5991-00000030"/> and I have no means of replenishing at present, unless I come over to town, which I shall do as soon as we get through threshing the oats. In the mean time, George, I wish you would lend me twenty shillings or so."</p> 
               <p>"Pray, what do you want of that, boy? I never saw anybody make use of so much money as you do. Why, it seems to me it costs more to live in the country than it does in town; and, if that is the case, I think I shall confine my rural visits to the night-time."</p> 
               <p>"When you can take sheep without asking the owner," chimed in Nathan, with a low laugh, which plainly showed that the strong brandy in the bottle had had a very exhilarating effect.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I should not do that," said George, rising and taking off his cape-coat, "only that I think property in this world is very unequally divided. What right has one man to own a hundred sheep, and another none? Why, I tell you it is doing him a favor to relieve him of one or two, now and then, and it gives the rest a better chance in the pasture. Wool is a cash article, and poor folks must live. My mother is a good woman, and if I take home money to her she never inquires where it comes from; and, then, if I take home a lot of wool, why, nobody knows off of what sheep's back it came when it is spun into yarn. So, you see, with that and a few other little tricks of trade, we get along very comfortably."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said his companion, slowly, with eyes half closed, "but how would you or your mother feel, if you should get cropped and branded, or your head stuck in<pb n=""/> the pillory? I suppose you would get along very comfortably then, would n't you? Eh, boy?"</p> 
               <p>"O, well! I guess I know enough to keep clear of those; but come, Nath, let us stake something, and go on with our game."</p> 
               <p>"Another sheep of the Saxon breed, I suppose," said Nathan, drowsily. "Well, I'll go up to the sheep-cote with you, by and by, and help bring one down, and stow it under the cuddy."</p> 
               <p>"Just so, Nathan, exactly; and then I will share the profits with you the next time I see you. So here goes for a deal."</p> 
               <p>A game was played, and Nathan lost, for the brandy and glowing heat of the fire had so bewildered his brain that he scarcely knew what he did. So, after they had played a second game, which George again won, George returned the cards to the till, and sunk the empty bottle to the bottom of his deep outside pocket; for his slow temperament caused him to have the better judgment. Then, with the long-handled slice which the former occupant had forgotten to remove, he shovelled apart the brands of fire, and covered the embers with hot ashes; then, going up to Nathan, who seemed to be sleeping, he shook him gently by the shoulders, and told him to stand outside in the frosty air, that it might bring him to his senses, while he put back the bench, and left things as they were when they entered. Nathan did as he was bidden, and when outside he seated himself on an old stump of a tree. As the cold wind swept past him it cooled his brow, and partially awakened his faculties, so that by the time George<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5991-00000031"/> came out he was sufficiently recovered to follow him as he proceeded towards the sheep-cote.</p> 
               <p>"You lead, now, Nathan," said George, as they came near the high fence; "for Watch would tear me in pieces, if it were not for your voice to quiet him. I wish you would shoot that dog, some time, or drown him, to get him out of the way."</p> 
               <p>"So you could have perfect liberty of the yard," said Nathan. "No, that won't do; for, to tell the truth, I think more of that dog than I do of any human being alive, and, if you don't want to lose your life, you had better keep away when I an't with you."</p> 
               <p>"No fear but that I shall, for I detest dogs generally."</p> 
               <p>"All rogues do," said Nathan, with a smothered laugh, at the same time calling the dog by name, and springing over the fence, and patting his head.</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Not all,</emph>" retorted George, attempting to follow; but instinct or reason taught the faithful watch-dog that he had no business there at that hour of the night, and, springing from Nathan's side, he endeavored to grapple his companion, who saw the movement and leaped back, while Nathan continued to pet the animal, to prevent his making a noise. When he was pacified, Nathan stepped carefully along to where the flock were crowded together in a corner, and, seizing one of the largest and fattest of the Saxon breed, held it fast until George let down a rope from the other side of the fence; then, binding it, they drew it over into the field, and from thence it was carried to a small boat that was anchored near the beach, and hidden by<pb n=""/> a projecting rock. "Good-by, Nath," said George, as he took an oar from the bottom of the boat to keep from rubbing against the rocks.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by," returned the other. "When shall I see you again?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, I can't say; but, if you should have any quiltings or paring-bees over here among the girls, why, send over a billet by the boat, and let me know; you can direct it to the care of Zekiel, at the grocery, on Long Wharf. I am in there every day, and I should be sure to get it."</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Nathan, as he slowly turned around, and walked back to where he had left the old watch-dog. "Come here, Watch," he said, as he again leaped over the fence. The dog slowly obeyed, but he did not return the caresses of the young man by licking his hands, and fawning upon him, as he was wont to do. It seemed as if he had an indistinct idea that something was wrong, and in his mute manner strove to make it known. "You're an honest dog, Watch," said Nathan, coaxingly, "and it is a great blessing to me that your tongue is not more useful. But it is getting late now, old fellow, and I must go and see what the folks are doing down at the house."</p> 
               <p>So he again smoothed the shining coat of the dog, and then took his way towards the house. Nathan had not entirely recovered from the effects of the evening's draught, but while he remained in the cool air it merely served to exhilarate his spirits, and quicken his pace; so he stepped quickly and quietly along until he came to the old farm-house, and then, as he passed the kitchen window, in going around to the back door, he<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5991-00000032"/> saw that the shutter was unclosed, and the bottom of the long rush curtain, in being let down, had caught in something that held it fast, and exposed a corner of a pane of glass, which would give one an opportunity to see those inside. "There is a candle burning," he said to himself; "and I will just see who is up. Perhaps it may be Lucy, and I am just in the mood to talk about love and marriage;" and he bent low, and crept along until he came to the pane of glass; then, rising slowly, he gave a look in. Words can hardly express the burning emotions that rushed through his heart, as he saw Richard draw Lucy to his knee. As his rival twined his arm around her waist, a desire for instant revenge possessed him, and he felt ready to rush in, regardless of his own life, and destroy theirs. And then gradually there came calmer thoughts. He would wait for slow but sure revenge. He tried to hear their words, but where he stood it was impossible, for the surf dashed against the rocks, and overpowered all other sounds; and he walked cautiously along the cow-path, until he came to the corn-crib, where, leaning against the eaves, was a small, light ladder, which the farmer sometimes used to ascend on the outside to his barn window. This he took noiselessly from its place, and stood it against the trunk of the old oak, whose broad arms grew out over the roof of the farm-house; then, going stealthily up the rounds, he went out upon the limb that passed within a few feet of the chimney. At the bottom of the ladder he had divested himself of his heavy boots; so, springing on to the ridge of the roof, and steadying himself by leaning over the strongly-cemented stones of the chimney, he could<pb n=""/> look directly down upon Richard and Lucy as they were seated on the dye-tub, and could distinctly hear every word that was spoken, as their voices came up through the wide channel which the mason of the olden time had provided for the smoke to curl and wreathe up. With most of the conversation of Richard and the farmer's daughter, as they sat by the expiring embers, the reader is already familiar. As Nathan bent his ear, and heard Lucy acknowledge her love for the young sailor, and her opinion of himself, he could hardly refrain from speaking aloud where he was, and expressing his bitter feelings. Then, reflecting that he could make no excuse for being there at that late hour, he concluded to listen quietly to the remainder of their colloquy. He heard Richard tell his history, and the obscurity of his early life; and he gathered information which was entirely new to him, as the young sailor had never been disposed to say much upon those subjects. Nathan heard him desire Lucy to say nothing about it, unless he should be fortunate enough to ascertain who were his parents, and the particulars of the perilous voyage that left him a babe among strangers.</p> 
               <p>When the inmates and candle had disappeared from the kitchen, Nathan clung to the chimney with one hand, while with the other he reached out and grasped a bough of the main limb that grew along the house-top. Drawing it nearer, he stepped upon the limb, and was soon again on the ladder, where he paused for a moment, and through an upper window saw Lucy pass into her chamber, and heard Richard go into his. When convinced that all was quiet within, he came down, and, taking his boots in one hand and the ladder in the<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5991-00000033"/> other, replaced the latter against the corn-crib, and then tried the latch of the wash-room door. The latch-string had been pulled in, as it was long past the hour when the occupants of the farm-house were usually at rest; and least of all would Mr. Ashland have suspected that Nathan was abroad, for generally he was the first to retire, and his absence at the fireside in the evening never created any remark, as always at such times, when he had been sought, he was found in his bed-room, where he slept alone. They knew not that often, when all the rest were sleeping, he came from his chamber, and passed out the back door, or from his window climbed down to the roof of the back porch, and then slid to the ground, to join companions that the honest-hearted farmer would have shuddered to know were about his door, or acquainted with any of his house-hold.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan found he could not enter by the back door, he returned to the corn-crib, got the ladder, and placed it beneath his window, intending to remove it before any one was up the next morning, and then ascended.</p>

               <p>WHEN Edna went to her chamber she took a seat in the large easy-chair that stood by the window which overlooked the bay, and, taking Freddy in her lap, commenced to unbutton his dress, and prepare him for bed. The child saw that she was sad, and he twined his little dimpled arms about her neck, and buried his face in her curls. Edna returned his embrace, and kissed him again and again, while her eyes filled with tears, and she pressed him closer to her bosom. "Poor little darling!" she sobbed, "we have a hard life before us. I almost wish it were ended, for then we should be at rest."</p> 
               <p>"Don't cry, Lizzie!" said the child, clinging more fondly to her; "it makes Freddy cry too." And he tried to wipe the tears from her lashes, but, when he found she still wept, he bowed his little head and sobbed too.</p> 
               <p>"There, there, darling," said Edna, endeavoring to<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5991-00000034"/> soothe him, "I won't cry any more; but you must n't call me Lizzie."</p> 
               <p>"What shall me call you, Lizzie?" interrogated Freddy, trying to stanch the tears with his sleeve.</p> 
               <p>"Call me Edna, darling."</p> 
               <p>"Did farver want me to call you Edna?"</p> 
               <p>"You have n't any father now, Freddy."</p> 
               <p>"Where he gone? Is he dead, Lizzie? Well, me will say Edna."</p> 
               <p>"I'll put on your night-dress now, Freddy," she said, without seeming to notice the last remark.</p> 
               <p>"Do," said the child; "for me is cold and sleepy, and when I am in bed you will come too."</p> 
               <p>"In a little while, darling, I will come, but first I want to sit here in this big chair, and look out upon the water; it looks so nice and bright, with the stars shining in it."</p> 
               <p>"Me wish somebody would pick up a star for Freddy," said the boy, as he looked from the window, and saw the bright reflections.</p> 
               <p>"O, simple, happy childhood!" murmured Edna, as she wrapped a warm shawl around his little, plump form; "it is a pity that it should ever end." And, with a good-night caress, she laid him on his pillow, and then, putting a thicker shawl about herself, she returned to the window to watch the waves and think. The low echo of voices came up from below as the farmer chatted with his wife and guest; and when the stranger spoke, she tried to catch his words, but could not. Drawing her shawl more closely around her, she turned her face towards the bay, and saw the white sail of a small boat as it hurried past and neared the<pb n=""/> shore above. This was the boat that conveyed George Howden to the little inlet, where he made her fast, and went to the collier's hut to see if he could meet with Nathan. Hours elapsed, and yet Edna did not leave the large chair at the window. At length the voices ceased below, and there was a heavy footstep on the stairs, which made her cheek turn pale, and her form contract. The farmer bade good-night, and the stranger answered the salutation, and then passed by the door of Edna's room. As she heard the kitchen door close, it seemed to bring relief to her mind; for she had feared that Mrs. Ashland might light the stranger to his room, and then, to see if she were comfortable, enter hers, and find her sitting there, attired as she had left the family group.</p> 
               <p>Soon all sounds died away below; for the voices of Richard and Lucy, seated within the jambs, after vibrating upon Nathan's ear, vanished into air. Little Freddy had long been sleeping, and still Edna sat by the window. Presently her chamber door was gently opened a small space, and her name pronounced in a low whisper. Edna sprang lightly from the chair, and cautiously approached the door. "O, Charles!" she said, in a whisper, "what have I not suffered this day! But I was more than half repaid when I saw you enter to-night."</p> 
               <p>"Well, dearest," said the stranger, "you cannot have suffered more in your feelings than I have;" and he gently put his arm around her neck, and pressed his lips to her cheek. May I come in, Lizzie," he whispered, still standing on the threshold, "and talk<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5991-00000035"/> with you a little while; for I have a great deal to say to you, and early in the morning I must away."</p> 
               <p>"And leave me, Charles?" said Edna, with a sigh. "Surely you will not desert me now!"</p> 
               <p>"Not unless you are willing," replied the young man, "and that is one thing I wish to talk with you about."</p> 
               <p>It was a clear, brilliant night, and as the moon and stars glistened on the water, and reflected into the large square chamber, every object became visible. The white oak floor, scoured until human strength could give it no clearer polish; the antique high-post bedstead, with its bright-hued canopy, and side drapery looped back to the posts with showy ribbons, revealing taste and neatness that well accorded with the times; the little mahogany-framed looking-glass, surmounted with a gilt crown, hanging over the table, between the front windows; in short, the whole chamber was furnished in the most approved style of comfort and elegance of those primitive days.</p> 
               <p>After the stranger had made the request to sit in Edna's room and converse with her on the subject which so interested both, she quietly slid from under his arm, and went to the window, and drew across the narrow panes the short white curtain, and then told him to come to the large arm-chair. After he was seated, Edna took a seat in another chair, near the window, saying, "Where have you been all day, Charles? I went over to town in hopes that you would come over in the sloop in the course of the day, and meet me there."</p> 
               <p>"Had I known you were there, I should; but, as<pb n=""/> you did not go over last night, I concluded you would remain here to-day, and I resolved to call here this evening, and seek an interview with you."</p> 
               <p>"But where did you stay last night?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, my little questioner, I see you are determined to know the particulars; so here you have them. After I got out of the chaise-top wagon that brought us from Littlerest, and came with you to the door, I went back and paid the young man for his trouble, and he drove away; then I sought shelter beneath the projecting top of that towering rock that you can see, if you look up the shore a few rods. And, O, Lizzie! I did not realize what a storm there was until I came near the water, and then I thought how imprudent I was to consent for you to ask the ferry-man to take you across the bay until morning."</p> 
               <p>"But, Charles, you said it would be too late then."</p> 
               <p>"Too late to take the vessel at Newport; but we could take passage in a packet, and meet her in New York, where she is to remain for a week or ten days before she starts for Europe. But, had we gone across the bay in the evening,-for you know I intended to present myself as a traveller, and go over with you,-it would have been too late, for the vessel got under weigh and left Newport yesterday morning."</p> 
               <p>"And shall we cross the ferry in the morning," inquired Edna, "and then take a packet for New York?"</p> 
               <p>"You shall, if you desire it," returned Charles, "after you have heard what I have to say; for no earthly power shall ever compel you to return to the spot you have left, unless it be your wish."</p> 
               <p>"My <emph>wish,</emph> Charles! Awful as would be the act, I<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5991-00000036"/> would rather die by my own hand than live to endure again the misery you have helped me to escape."</p> 
               <p>"Brave girl!" said Charles. "You deserve a better fate, and I have faith that you will yet see it, and be mine, though the prospect is dreary now; but for the proposal."</p> 
               <p>"First, tell me where you have spent the day."</p> 
               <p>"Well, after I had remained long enough beneath the shelter of the rock to be convinced that you would not cross the ferry that night, I came out of my hiding-place, and approached this house, thinking I would come in and stay all night here; but then I thought if I entered so soon after you the family might be suspicious that we were acquainted, and perhaps had travelled together; so I opened my umbrella, and walked up the road to a little hut or cottage, and inquired if I could stay all night. A negress came to the door, and said she could not accommodate me, but directed me to come here, saying she was well acquainted with the folks, and knew that they would keep me. I thanked her, and went on."</p> 
               <p>"I think that was old Prue," said Edna, "a kind-hearted but rather inquisitive colored woman, who came here this morning to work for Mrs. Ashland; but she said nothing about any stranger stopping there."</p> 
               <p>"O, I suppose it awakened no curiosity, as she said she often recommended people to come here. After I left her door, I travelled on for a long distance, and then I saw a light away back from the road; so I turned my steps in that direction, and there I was more successful in procuring lodging. There was no one in the little farm-house but a widow and her daughter,<pb n=""/> and a hired man who works on the farm; it is several miles from here, and there I remained until towards evening to-night, when I came hither to see how you had passed the day, and to make arrangements for the future. We must not be seen together, Lizzie, as acquaintances, until we are far away from here. Now I will tell you my proposition. You have never been on the North American coast in the winter, and you can have but little idea of the hardships endured by those exposed to so severe a climate. The ship in which we intend to sail is not calculated to be a comfortable home for one as delicate as you, and I sometimes fear you would never reach the land."</p> 
               <p>"But you, Charles,-what is to become of you?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I am of sterner make, and can withstand the storms, as I have often done before. Never fear for me. I will take care of myself, and return for you when the birds are singing, and the flowers are in bloom."</p> 
               <p>"Next summer, Charles?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and in the mean time I will write to you often, and see that you lack for nothing."</p> 
               <p>"But where shall I stay, Charles, that they cannot find me? For you know that they will leave no means untried; and, should I be compelled to return, my condition would be far more sad than ever."</p> 
               <p>"That is too true, dearest; but let us not look for any such calamity, but hope for better days. We must not, we <emph>shall</emph> not be separated forever."</p> 
               <p>"O, that I could think so, Charles! It would nerve me to endure with fortitude the greatest hardships that could come."</p> 
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5991-00000037"/> 
               <p>"And could you be contented here, Lizzie? I have been talking with the farmer's family to-night, and they appear very kind-hearted, and are extremely fond of children."</p> 
               <p>"You did not say anything about my staying?" inquired Edna, anxiously.</p> 
               <p>"O, no, Lizzie; I only talked in a round-about way,-not so as to excite suspicion that I ever saw you before."</p> 
               <p>"That was right, Charles; for, should they trace you as accompanying me, they would know where to search for me; but now they will think I am alone with Freddy, and dare not cross the sea without a protector. They know that when I left them I was penniless; so it is better that you and I should travel as strangers. I have assumed another name; so that, if any one inquires for Elizabeth-"</p> 
               <p>"Well done! that is admirably arranged," said the young man, interrupting her. "There is no fear of a surprise when a soldier knows and does his duty."</p> 
               <p>"But sometimes, Charles, I feel as if, perhaps, I were not doing my duty; and it were better for me to stay and suffer, than to take Freddy from his home."</p> 
               <p>"Freddy shall never need a home while I have one, dearest; so feel no anxiety on that account."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you, Charles, and will do as you direct. But how do you know that the farmer's family are willing that we shall remain here?-Did they say so?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Lizzie, they did." And then he related the conversation that passed between the farmer and his wife and himself. As Edna listened, she drew the<pb n=""/> shawl more closely around her shoulders, for the air was chill and cold. They continued their dialogue until the morning approached, and faint streaks of light in the eastern horizon gave evidence that the household would soon be astir.</p> 
               <p>Then the stranger slowly and reluctantly arose, and, pressing Edna once more to his heart, said, with all the cheerfulness he could command, "Keep up good courage, dear; for the winter will soon pass away, and you will be very comfortable here, and then I will return for you, and naught but death shall ever separate us again."</p> 
               <p>"This is a lonely spot," said Edna, again looking towards the water, and the leafless branches of the walnut-grove near by.</p> 
               <p>"It is better suited for our purpose," returned the other, "than if it were nearer the populous town."</p> 
               <p>"Very true," said Edna; "so I will try to be contented. But you will not leave Newport until you are sure that I can remain here."</p> 
               <p>"No, dearest. The packet will not leave until to-morrow morning; so, if aught should prevent you from staying here, or, on reflection, you should prefer to cross the sea this winter, then come to me this afternoon at the Wilson Inn, and we will sail together. But, if you should not remain, I fear you would peril your own life and Freddy's."</p> 
               <p>And then he told her how and where to direct her letters to him, and where he would address his in return; and further promised her that, should anything transpire to prevent his coming for her the next summer, he would direct her what course to pursue; and,<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5991-00000038"/> if she repented of the step she had taken, she was to write to him, and both were to destroy the letters they received.</p> 
               <p>Then, approaching the bedside, the young man bent and kissed the cheek of Frederick, who lay in sweet forgetfulness, and stirred not at the touch; for there were no frightful dreams flitting through his brain, to cause him to start at the caress, as if he fancied the fangs of a serpent were fastening in his flesh.</p> 
               <p>"Does he speak of home, Lizzie?" inquired Charles.</p> 
               <p>"O, no! A child, when occupied with new things, soon forgets the past. But, hark! I think I hear Mr. Ashland's step below."</p> 
               <p>The traveller listened a moment, and then, taking her hand in his, said, "God bless you, Lizzie, till we meet again."</p> 
               <p>A mute answer from Edna's tearful eyes told more than tongue could speak, and thus they separated.</p>

               <p>WHEN Charles left the square chamber, he stepped lightly across the narrow entry to the room assigned him by his hostess. Disrobing himself, and laying his head on the soft, snowy pillow, he was soon asleep, nor did he waken until the sun was melting the long icicles that swayed to and fro on the limbs of the old oak. Then, springing up, he hastily performed his morning's toilet, and went down stairs. The farmer's family had long since breakfasted, but the pewter teapot still steamed by the fire, and the heavy bake-kettle hung high on the crane, half filled with the family's favorite bread.</p> 
               <p>"Take a seat on the dye-tub, sir," said Mrs. Ashland, as she saw the stranger enter; "for it's a very cold snap we are having, and that is as comfortable a place as a body can have in such weather."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," said Charles, advancing to the proffered seat, and inquiring if the ferry-boat had crossed the bay that morning.</p> 
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5991-00000039"/> 
               <p>"Well, no, I believe it has not," answered the farmer's wife; "there has n't been any one along to go over this morning, but there will be somebody soon, most likely; so here, Lucy, you put by your wheel, and help me to get Mr.--what shall I call your name?"</p> 
               <p>"Aylesbury," said Charles.</p> 
               <p>"Aylesbury-Aylesbury," repeated Mrs. Ashland, "that is not a very common name; I don't know as I ever heard of it before. But come, Lucy, as soon as you have finished that roll you are spinning, you take the small table out, and put it right up to the fire. Miss Benton hasn't come down; for, poor child, she looked so tired last night that I thought I wouldn't awaken her. I think when folks are young they need more sleep."</p> 
               <p>"I wish, mother, that you could convert father to your way of thinking," said Lucy, smiling; "for, when there are no clouds to obscure it, I always see the sun rise."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I know, child, you are an early riser; but I don't see that you look any the worse for it; so, in your case, perhaps it is just as well to rise early and cultivate the roses on your cheeks. But run out into the milk-room and get some cream for Mr. Aylesbury's tea, and then go up and see how Miss Benton is, and if she is ready for her breakfast."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother," said Lucy, and, with a light step, she tripped out through the long wash-room to the large closet where the milk was kept, and soon returned with the blue pitcher almost flowing over with cream, and, depositing it on the table, again<pb n=""/> disappeared, and was presently standing by the bed occupied by Edna and the child. Edna had wrapped a shawl about her, and was just completing the dressing of Freddy, when Lucy knocked at her door. After a few remarks, she took Freddy in her arms, saying to Edna that if she hurried down she would have the pleasure of taking breakfast with that handsome stranger who stayed there last night. The young girl smiled, and said she did not care so much about breakfasting with the handsome stranger as she did about sleeping a little longer, if Lucy would see to the child a little while.</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly," said Lucy, "I will take care of him with pleasure, for he is a dear little fellow;" and, kissing him, she went down to the fire.</p> 
               <p>"How do you do, my little man?" said Mrs. Ashland, extending her hand, as Lucy stood him on the hearth.</p> 
               <p>"Me do very hungry," he answered, clapping his hands and running across the floor for a chair, as he saw the traveller partaking of a smoking breakfast.</p> 
               <p>"Come sit in my lap," said Mr. Aylesbury, putting out his hand, as the child approached the table.</p> 
               <p>"No, me is big now," said Freddy, crawling up into the narrow, high-backed chair he had dragged across the sanded floor; "and me want my silver cup, with milk in it."</p> 
               <p>"We have no silver cups here, my little boy," said Mrs. Ashland, going to the closet, and opening the upper glass door, and taking out a polished pewter porringer; "but won't this do as well?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Freddy, brushing back his flaxen curls<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5991-00000040"/> from his forehead, and his bright eyes flashing with delight, as he looked at the glowing fire and well-filled table.</p> 
               <p>"Where did you come from, bubby?" said Lucy, as she bent over the child and broke his bread into the milk, "that you have been in the habit of eating out of a silver cup?"</p> 
               <p>"Way, way off," said Freddy.</p> 
               <p>"Don't ask him any more questions, Lucy," said Mrs. Ashland, as she remembered the words of her husband. "It is nothing to us where he came from; but he is a good child, let him come from where he will."</p> 
               <p>Edna did not leave the chamber until she saw the Swallow push off with him she loved on board; then, throwing herself into a chair, she wept bitterly for a few moments, but soon recovered herself, and, appearing as cheerful as possible, went down to the kitchen. Little Frederick had not yet arisen from the table, though it was some time since his hunger was appeased. When he saw Edna approaching, he leaped to the floor, and, taking hold of her dress, drew her towards the table.</p> 
               <p>"Is n't he an interesting child, mother?" said Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"Very," replied Mrs. Ashland, smiling, "and I guess we shall have to keep him."</p> 
               <p>"And would you keep me, too?" said Edna, seating herself at the table.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly," replied the other; "if we took the boy, we should expect to keep the mother."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, if you are willing, we should like to<pb n=""/> remain with you this winter, at least," said Edna, blushing, and looking timidly at her hostess.</p> 
               <p>"Why! would your hus-moth-folks like to have you stay away from home all winter?" said Mrs. Ashland, surprised, although pleased, by the wish of Edna.</p> 
               <p>"I have no home," said the young woman, sadly.</p> 
               <p>"But, then, where did you come from, my dear, that you are here alone with your child, at this season of the year?"</p> 
               <p>Edna pushed back the little round table, for she seemed to have no appetite for breakfast, and leaned her cheek on the palm of her hand, gazing silently into the fire, as if reflecting whether to unburden her troubled heart and seek the protection of the farmer's family, or to conceal a portion of her former life. Finally, she said, "I have no home, Mrs. Ashland, neither am I Freddy's mother; but he is as dear to me as if I gave him life, and never will I part with him while I have strength to labor for him. My intention, when I came here, was to cross the ferry in season to take passage in a ship bound for England; but I arrived at Newport too late, was disappointed, and have returned here. Again I repeat, I have no home; but, when summer comes, I am in hopes to find a friend in Europe, with whom I can dwell; until then, if you have no objection, I should like to stay with you, and I will do all I can to make myself useful, and will be no further expense to you than the board of myself and Freddy."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" exclaimed Mrs. Ashland, drawing from her pocket a blue-bordered domestic handker-<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5991-00000041"/> chief, and wiping the tears from her eyes; "you shall stay here just as long as you are a mind to; for we have plenty and to spare, and I guess we shall never be any poorer for what you and your baby consume; so make yourself at home as much as you can. You will be a nice companion for Lucy, for she often tells how lonesome she is, and what a comfort it would be to have a sister." And then, turning to Lucy, who stood silent, with her right hand resting on the wheel-band, listening to her mother and the stranger, she continued, "So, Lucy, you can make a sister of Edna, poor child, and I hope you will always agree."</p> 
               <p>"It shall not be my fault, mother," said Lucy, leaving the wheel and coming forward to where Miss Benton was sitting; and then, kneeling down beside her and reaching out her hand, she looked up into her face, where the tears still glistened, and said, "O! I know that we shall be very happy, for you can't think what pleasant times we have in the country in the winter."</p> 
               <p>Edna returned the caress that Lucy gave, and tried to smile through her tears; but she could think of nothing but the cold north wind sweeping over the water and driving the foaming surge against the rocky shore, and the naked trees creaking and groaning as they bent to the wintry blast.</p> 
               <p>Lucy was young and full of hope, and thus far the pathway of her life had been a sunny one. She thought that when the stranger became better acquainted she would overcome her loneliness, and she resolved to introduce her to the young people of the<pb n=""/> neighborhood, and make every effort to render her sojourn at the farm-house happy.</p> 
               <p>"Me is your boy, now," said Freddy, running up to Mr. Ashland, as he entered the kitchen a few hours after. "Liz-Edna says she going to live here always, and then me be a farmer and hoe the hay."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland laughed quite heartily at Freddy's idea of farming, and then asked his wife what the child meant.</p> 
               <p>"Well, go right back to the scraper, and get the snow off your boots, and then I will tell you," said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>The old farmer turned around as readily as if he were accustomed to obey, and went back to the sharp stone rolled up beside the back door, and removed the condensed snow-flakes that had adhered to the soles of his boots; then returning, he took a seat on the dye-tub, in an attitude to listen. The child climbed up into his lap, and looked anxiously first into his face, and then into the farmer's wife's, as she told what the stranger had said that morning.</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" said the farmer, with a sigh; "I am sure I am perfectly willing that they should stay. But I don't want you, nor the rest, to keep asking her questions about who she is and where she came from; if she behaves well, it is none of our business."</p> 
               <p>"La! I shall never say another word to her about it, husband; I think just as you do, that it don't concern us."</p> 
               <p>"No, Martha; if she only conducts well, that is all,-and as for this little fellow, he is going to be a smart boy, one of these days. Did she tell you his age?"</p> 
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC5991-00000042"/> 
               <p>"Yes; he was two years old the twentieth of last June."</p> 
               <p>"Why, that is just about the age of Sammy. Now I think, perhaps he belonged to-to-to somebody that was poor, and they died, and gave him to her mother to bring up, and she died; and now Edna, maybe, is going to live with some of her rich relations next spring, and she feels so bad about her mother's dying that she don't want to speak of it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I really believe you are right, John; so I hope we shall never hurt her feelings by saying anything to remind her of the past."</p> 
               <p>"No," said the farmer; but he had not time to say any more, for Edna now entered, with her bonnet and mantle on, and stood waiting at the fire for the passengers who were in the great room to get ready to go on board the Swallow.</p> 
               <p>"You will not be gone long?" said Mrs. Ashland, interrogatively, to her.</p> 
               <p>"No," answered the girl; "I would not go, only that I have some articles of clothing I would like to get, which were forwarded to the town."</p> 
               <p>"That is a good idea," said the farmer's wife, "for you could not do much with such finery on; we wear nothing but plain clothes on the farm; they are a great deal better to work in. But it is time for you to go, child; they have all gone out of the great room down to the boat."</p> 
               <p>"Kiss me, darling," said Edna, as she passed by Freddy, who had slid down out of Mr. Ashland's lap, and was now astride of the old house-dog's back, performing various equestrian feats, and occasionally roll-<pb n=""/> ing off on to the floor, much to the amusement of Prue's little Sammy, who had just arrived with his mother, and stood leaning against the fireplace, disclosing a perfect set of Nature's dentistry, while she prepared to begin her day's work of carding. Freddy gave the desired kiss, and then, shaking the sand from his apron, he ran up to Sammy, and, taking his hand, said, "Come, me and you both ride jack-horse with the dog." Sammy looked up into his mother's face for approval, and, being answered by the monosyllable "Go," he took the hand of Freddy and went back to the dog; nor did they end their play till they received some pretty severe bumps, and old Bose withdrew to more peaceful quarters under the table. Old Prue sat in the corner, on the dye-tub, with one eye on the increasing heap of rolls, and the other glancing, now and then, after the two boys, who were romping and playing about the floor.</p> 
               <p>"Why, how amazing well they agree!" said the negress, looking with pride on her own chubby boy. "I wish that little fellow was going to stay here; he would be so much company for my Sammy!"</p> 
               <p>"He is going to stay," said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>Prue dropped the card she was holding, and threw her head back so far that it came in contact with the rough stones of the jamb behind her. "Now, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland," she said, "I know you're joking; only to think of it! That dear soul going to stay here without his mother?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no; she is going to stay, too; but she is n't his mother. I don't believe he has any mother; this girl only took him to bring up."</p> 
               <p>"The Lord be praised!" ejaculated Prue; "the elder said the truth last Sunday, when he said God had n't<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5991-00000043"/> done performing <emph>meracles;</emph> for he performed them every day, even in our midst. To think of it! that young gal to take that little child to keep, and be so good to it! Well, I never! But do tell me all about it, and everything she said, for I have thought a deal about her since I was here yesterday; she seemed so kind of sober-like, as if she was in trouble."</p> 
               <p>"Well, we don't know much about her, Prue; but we think perhaps she has lately lost her mother, and that is what makes her feel so bad. But we don't intend to say anything to her about it, for I don't think it is right to be too inquisitive."</p> 
               <p>"Nor I either, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland," said Prue, with a queer expression; and she straightened herself back, and resumed her carding, at the same time humming a slow psalm-tune, and watching the children in their play.</p> 
               <p>When Edna landed at Newport, she walked slowly along up one of the most unfrequented streets, until she came opposite a large elm; then, crossing over, she stood beneath its leafless branches and looked towards an old-fashioned inn a little further on, which stood back from the street.</p> 
               <p>"There's a pretty girl looking this way from under that old elm," said a young man who stood at the porch in front of the door. "I guess she has lost her way."</p> 
               <p>"I will go and see," said his companion, "for I always pity a stranger in a strange place; and in the mean time you can go down to the wharf, and see about getting our baggage on board of the packet."</p> 
               <p>"I will, Aylesbury," answered the other, and he turned and went into the inn, while Charles walked towards the place where Edna was standing.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"I feared," said the girl, "that the packet might start sooner than you anticipated, Charles; so I came over to tell you that I shall stay there this winter, and I think I shall be very comfortable."</p> 
               <p>The young man's countenance brightened,-for when he saw her he was afraid that something might have happened to prevent her remaining at the farm-house,-and he replied, "I am glad, dearest, that you will be so comfortably situated this winter; it is far better for you than to attempt to cross the sea at this season of the year; and the winter will soon pass away, and then I will return for you." And then he offered her his arm, and together they walked along, nor heeded the distance until they came to the clearing that surrounded that time-worn and mysterious structure, the old stone mill.</p> 
               <p>"I must now retrace my steps," said Edna, "for I promised Mrs. Ashland that I would soon return; and, besides, Freddy might be uneasy without me, and cause them some trouble."</p> 
               <p>"True," said Charles, sadly; "and it will be as hard to part a few hours hence as at the present moment. Mine will be a dull voyage without you; but we must try to be cheerful, and look forward to our meeting by and by. But what shall I say to Mrs. Dacre, Lizzie? for she expected you to return with me, and she will be sadly disappointed that I come back alone."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, Charles; but you can explain all, and tell her that you left me in a pleasanter home than the one I had before you came here. But you must not return with me to the boat; I must go alone, and call on the way for those things I left yesterday."</p> 
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5991-00000044"/> 
               <p>Accordingly, before they came to the most thickly-settled part of the town, Charles took the unresisting hand of Edna in his, and pressed it to his lips. Neither spoke; for the emotions of both were too deep to be expressed by words. For some moments Charles stood alone on the spot where he had just parted from the lovely girl, and watched her receding form as she passed down the street; but soon the serpentine walk bore her from his view, and, turning slowly around, he walked in the direction of the inn he had left but a short time previous.</p> 
               <p>"Your baggage is all on board, and the captain says he shall haul off to-night, Mr. Aylesbury," said the former companion, as Charles neared the porch.</p> 
               <p>"I am all ready to go on board," said he, rather abstractedly.</p> 
               <p>"And so am I," returned the other, stepping off the planks, and turning towards the wharf. "But what ails you, boy? One would think you were trying to lengthen your face to puritanic dimensions. O, how was it about that pretty girl? Did you find out who she was, or if she was lost?"</p> 
               <p>"I did n't inquire her name," said Charles, rallying and passing his arm through his companion's.</p> 
               <p>"I wish I had walked over to the old elm instead of you; I would have found out all about her."</p> 
               <p>"And what good would that do you, now you are going to leave town?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I shall soon be back again; I am not going to return to Europe, as you are." And thus the two walked on; Elisha Grey, the younger, chatting and laughing, with buoyant spirits, while thinking of the<pb n=""/> prospective trip to New York, and of incidents that transpired a few weeks before, on board the brig Albion, where they were fellow-passengers from Liverpool to New York.</p> 
               <p>When the Swallow, with Edna on board, approached the narrow pier, Lucy was standing on the rough stone step, at the entrance of the back porch, with a large sea-shell in her hand, in the act of blowing it, as a signal that the dinner-hour had arrived. Inhaling the pure sea-breeze until her chest had become fully expanded, she gave two or three loud, shrill blasts, that seemed to awaken the echoes of the forest, and, rebounding, skim the surface of the water. As the piercing notes from the variegated shell fell on Richard Conworth's ear, he withdrew one hand from the rudder, and raised the shining rim of his tarpaulin; looking in the direction from whence the sounds emanated, he bowed low, and answered, through his half-closed hand, a pleasant "Ay, ay, all ready."</p> 
               <p>Lucy shaded her eyes from the sun with her hand, for a moment, to see who were on board; and then, as she espied the form of Edna, she laid the shell on a bench beside the door, and, with a quick pace, tripped down to the water's edge, and climbed up the gray old rock beside the pier, to see the passengers land. In a few moments the sloop was made fast, and Richard conducted Edna to the shore.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad you are come," said Lucy, hastening down to her side, "for we were afraid Freddy might get impatient."</p> 
               <p>"Has he been much trouble to you?" inquired Edna, pleasantly.</p> 
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5991-00000045"/> 
               <p>"O! no," answered her companion; "and I mean it shall not be long before he will love us so that he will hardly miss you when you are absent."</p> 
               <p>Edna smiled, and then twined her arm around Lucy, and walked to the house, where Richard soon followed, bringing the baggage belonging to his passenger. As the two girls entered the house, Freddy ran to his protectress, and, clapping his hands with joy, exclaimed, "O Liz-" He did not finish the sentence, for at that moment he caught her eye, and he remembered her injunction; then, after a brief silence, he put his lips to her ear and whispered, "Me shan't forget again, Edna." Her only answer was a kiss and fond pressure to her bosom, and then he continued, "O! me had such nice time! Sammy is good, if he is black, and so is Bose and Watch; and Freddy give them doughnuts, and so did Sammy."</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Mrs. Ashland, laughing and coming forward; "I fried a pan of doughnuts, and left them on the dye-tub for a few moments, while Prue and I went up garret to get some more wool; and when we came back Freddy, and Sammy, and Bose, and Watch, were all helping themselves out of the pan."</p> 
               <p>"That was wrong," said Edna, rather sternly, and looking at the child as she held him in her arms. In an instant the smile died away from his lips; all expression of joy left his countenance, and, dropping his head on her shoulder, he sobbed aloud.</p> 
               <p>"Poor little dear!" said Prue, wiping her eyes with a corner of her check apron; "I should n't think you would scold at him, for I expect it was all Sammy's fault; he was always amazin' fond of doughnuts,-and<pb n=""/> dogs too, as to that, and will always give them all he can find to eat."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, Miss Benton, don't scold at the little boy," said Mr. Ashland. "I'd rather all the bolted rye on the farm should be made into doughnuts, for the express purpose of feeding the children and the dogs, than to have him grieve so." The farmer took the child, and seated himself at the table, with Freddy on his knee; and, before the dinner was over, gave him a bright penny, and a promise that some day he should go out into the meadow, and see him lay stone wall and make zig-zag fence.</p> 
               <p>When all had finished their repast, Edna stepped quietly up to her room, and exchanged her travelling dress for a neat figured calico; so quick and easy had been her movements, she had not been missed from the room when she returned. "I will wash the dishes for you, Mrs. Ashland," she said, pleasantly, as she came back to the side of the table, and began to collect the bright pewter plates, and remove the fragments from the different dishes.</p> 
               <p>"Can you, child?" said the farmer's wife, glancing at her white hands. "You don't look as though you ever washed any dishes, or done much housework of any kind."</p> 
               <p>Edna gave no reply, but her cheeks turned a very deep crimson, as the plain-spoken matron made the remark; but, as there was no further allusion to her lack of knowledge in housewifery, she continued the work, while Lucy went to her wheel, to hurry through the fall spinning, and Mrs. Ashland resumed her morning's sewing.</p> 
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5991-00000046"/> 
               <p>"She will make a smart gal, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland, bimeby," said Prue, in an under-tone, and giving a slight inclination of her head towards the corner cupboard, where Edna was standing. "She will be a deal of help to you, when she gets a little used to the house; see how kind of nice she sets up the plates, and puts the silver teaspoons into that chaney mug, and wipes the dust off that glass door. Poor child! I wonder if she used to do such things for her mother."</p> 
               <p>When the sanded floor was swept off, in waves, and the high, narrow-backed chairs placed against the wall, Edna drew near the fire, and asked Mrs. Ashland if there was anything more she wished her to do around the house.</p> 
               <p>"I think not, dear," she replied; "take a seat up here, and warm you."</p> 
               <p>"I am not cold," said Edna; "but perhaps you would like to have me assist you in sewing."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if you know how to sew well, you will be a great help to me, especially when Miss Tristam comes to do the tailoring for the men-folks; for we all like to sit right down and help her,-it is such a tedious job to work on thick cloth. So, child, you can get your thimble, and I will give you some work."</p> 
               <p>"You go look in the blue chest in the bed-room, Lucy," said Mrs. Ashland, after the entry door had closed, and Edna's light step was heard on the stairs, "and bring me that bandanna handkerchief your father bought over to town, last week; I guess I will let her hem that first, and, if she don't sew it well, in won't hurt it to pick it out."</p> 
               <p>Lucy ran up the thread she had just manufactured<pb n=""/> from the roll, and then complied with her mother's request. Edna was gone some time in search of her thimble, and when she did return there seemed to be traces of tears on her cheeks; but no one alluded to the signs of grief, and, after she had taken a seat at the spacious old fireplace, and commenced to ply the needle, with Freddy by her side, chatting and laughing, she soon began to smile and talk cheerfully, while the inmates of the room thought, each to herself, that the cause of sorrow was some memento she had seen among the articles in her trunk. Their conjecture was right; for when she opened the box that contained her thimble there fell out a light, flaxen curl, which awoke memory, and brought up the past, as plainly as if a panoramic view had passed before her.</p> 
               <p>And now all gathered around the blazing fire; the old-fashioned spinning wheel was brought closer, and, while Lucy, with her plump hand, would cause the large rim to whirl rapidly, she would ever and anon cast a glance through the window that overlooked the bay, and see Richard guide the Swallow gracefully away from the pier, and then, after an hour or two's absence, return to the shore. Mrs. Ashland plied her needle dexterously, dividing her conversation between the different members of the group, not one of whom seemed happier than Prue, who was now buttoning around her son's chubby form a bright merino frock, the counterpart of one which Freddy had on, and which Edna had brought her as a present when she came down with the thimble.</p> 
               <p>"O, bless me! <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland, an't that a handsome dress?-all 'broidered round the bottom; why, how<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5991-00000047"/> nice Sammy does look! I'm much obleeged to you, Miss Edna, very much; and if ever you want any favors of me, why, all you got to do is to say so."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> want one now, Aunty Prue," said Lucy, laughing, and looking first at Prue, and then at little black Sammy, squeezed into the short dress that a few days previous had clothed the symmetrical form of Freddy.</p> 
               <p>"I'll warrant you," said Prue, without noticing what Lucy said, and looking admiringly at Sammy, who was strutting about, and seemed to be comparing his costume with Freddy's,-"I'll warrant you that Sammy thinks he ought to have some drawers."</p> 
               <p>"I have a piece like the dress," answered Edna, "and I will make him a pair to go with it."</p> 
               <p>"O, bless you, dear," said Prue, "that would be too much trouble."</p> 
               <p>"O, no," said Edna. "I will do it as soon as Mrs. Ashland can spare me the leisure."</p> 
               <p>"Do it just when you please, Edna," returned the farmer's wife; "I do not want or expect you to employ all your time for me. I want you to make yourself and Freddy as comfortable and happy as you can; I am not a bit afraid but what you will pay your way. I don't know what Mr. Ashland will do if you ever take Freddy away from us."</p> 
               <p>Edna was about to reply, but she was interrupted by Lucy, who was teasing Prue to tell them a story.</p> 
               <p>"Well, you see, Lucy," said Prue, "if I tell you anything, it must be something about this old farm-house, or the ferry; for I never was twenty miles away from it in my life, and I can't read; so all I know is what I have seen, and what folks tell me."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Well, Aunty, tell us something about the ferry when grandfather used to run it, and about some of the people that used to stop here over night, to take the boat in the morning."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear!" said Prue, laughing, "there used to be some strange kind of folks stop here, once in a while. Did n't you never hear your husband tell about that man that smelt of mother's Injun cake, one night?" she questioned, looking at the farmer's wife.</p> 
               <p>"O, tell it, tell it!" said Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I will; but I always have to laugh when I think of the first of it; but I don't laugh long, for I think further than that."</p>

                     <l>"The news! his morning, noon, and evening cry."</l>
                  </q> 
               </epigraph> 
               <p>"WELL, one evening," began Prue, addressing Lucy, "old Mr. Ashland and his wife was sitting round this same old fireplace; your father and I was nothing but little children,-rather older than Sammy, I expect, because we both remember all about it. But I guess I won't tell it now, for there comes your father and Nathan up the path-most likely they are coming in to warm themselves. It is pretty cold work to lay stone wall such weather as this."</p> 
               <p>"O, never mind!" said Lucy, rather impatiently; "they both like to hear stories just as well as I do. So do go on. Probably Nathan has come home to do up his work, and get ready to watch the sheep-cote; for I heard father say that some one took another from the flock last night, and he wanted Nathan to stay there to-night, and see if he could n't detect the thief."</p> 
               <p>At this moment Mr. Ashland opened the kitchen door, and was followed by Nathan. Lucy immediately handed her father a chair, and he and Nathan seated themselves by the fire.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"It is really curious who takes those sheep," said Mrs. Ashland, looking into her husband's face.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is," answered the farmer, without lifting his eyes from the glowing coals. "And it is more strange that Watch does n't give warning when they come after them; for he has always been a very faithful watch-dog. I never knew him to let strangers come around the house without letting us know that some one was near with whom we were not familiar."</p> 
               <p>Nathan was sitting at the fire in such a position that none of the group could have such a clear view of his face as Lucy, who had removed her wheel further back, and, as she paced to and fro, approached near his chair.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps they are not taken by strangers," said she, giving Nathan a scrutinizing glance; who turned a little pale for a moment, but, quickly recovering himself, threw back such a look of defiance that she did not dare to repeat what she had said.</p> 
               <p>Lucy did not suspect Nathan of committing the thefts at the sheep-cote, nor of breaking into the corn-crib, a few weeks previous, and removing several bushels of threshed grain, nor of being engaged in the numerous depredations upon the farm within a year; but, as she did not like him, she made the remark to tease him. Prudence, however, forbade her to say more, though his angry countenance awakened suspicions in which she feared to indulge.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland, who sat gazing into the fire, apparently lost in thought, did not notice the remark of his daughter; and Lucy soon broke the silence by request-<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5991-00000049"/> ing Prue to tell the story she was commencing when her father and Nathan entered.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," she answered. "As I was saying, your grandfather and grandmother were sitting by the fire, one evening, when the old smack, as we used to call her, came up alongside of the pier. Among the passengers was one tall, stout man, with sandy hair, and a dreadful big mouth, and a long beard that covered more than half of his face. So, when the smack was tied, he, among the rest, got out, and came up to the house. I remember well how John-that is your father-and me ran up in the corner, and got on to the dye-tub, for fear he had come to take us off; for sometimes mother used to tell us stories about children's being carried off by Injuns, and all that. But, just to look at him, you might have known that he would n't care much about children, unless he could run away with them, and sell them for slaves, or something of that sort. Well, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland got up and offered him a seat near the fire, which he took; and, as soon as he had got a little warm, he turned to your grandfather, and asked if he could have some supper. Mr. Ashland said yes; and then told mother, who a few minutes before had patted out a corn-cake on the Johnny-cake board, and set it up in front of the coals, that she might fix a comfortable meal. Mother went and drew up the little round table from the further part of the room, and spread the cloth, every now and then giving a look at the red-bearded stranger; and I could see that she did n't like the looks of him very well, and I suppose that was the reason she did n't hurry more about getting his supper ready. Pretty<pb n=""/> soon she came back to the fire to see to her cake, and turn the lower edge up.</p> 
               <p>"'What is that you're a cooking on a board?' said the traveller. 'See, one end on't is all on fire.'</p> 
               <p>"Mother took up the board and blew out the little blaze on the corner, and set it back again, and turned to go away. She had just started to go across the room when the stranger took up the cake and put his nose clear down to it, to see if he could tell what kind of a cake it was by smelling. I saw mother look at him, and then she put her flat hand under the board and gave it such a slap that the whiskered man's nose entirely disappeared as it entered the soft dough on the board; and I never shall forget the scene that followed. Don't you remember it, Mr. Ashland, how you and me jumped down from the dye-tub, and hid under the table, while he ran round the room, with his fist doubled up, after my mother?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland smiled as the recollection of that scene came up before his mind, and nodded assent to what Prue had said.</p> 
               <p>"Why, I do believe," continued Prue, "that he would have killed mother, if it had n't been for her master and mistress, who were in the room, and told him to go back to his seat, and let things alone. But, O, dear! how funny he did look!"</p> 
               <p>And Prue opened her wide mouth and gave out such a hearty laugh at the remembrance, that each member of the group joined with her, and laughed heartily at her description, until the negress stopped, and said,</p> 
               <p>"But that is not the end of the story, and perhaps I<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5991-00000050"/> had better not tell the rest; for I always feel so when I think of that man, and how he stayed here all night under this very roof, with no one in the house but our own men and women folks. Why, I wonder he had n't murdered all of us."</p> 
               <p>"It is very seldom you hear of a murder," said Mr. Ashland, "unless the murderer thinks he is sure of finding money; and ferry-men and farmers don't generally have much on hand."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I know it," said Prue; "but-"</p> 
               <p>"O, do go on and tell us all about him, and what became of him," said Lucy, interrupting her.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Nathan, who had regained his self-possession, and was laughing at the tale.</p> 
               <p>"His name was Jeffers," continued the narrator, "and he stayed here all night; and the next morning at a very early hour he asked Mr. Ashland to take him in his wagon and carry him to a place I think he called Swanzey. But Mr. Ashland thought it was too far to go clear there; so he said he would let one of his hired men take him part way, and then he could get somebody else to take him the rest. So he harnessed up one of the horses, and let Joe Cooper take him off in the direction he wanted to go. Joe was a great, surly sort of a young man, and he was gone most all day. And, when he sat down in the corner after supper, we began to ask him questions about the big man he carried off in the morning.</p> 
               <p>"'I don't know where he is gone,' said Joe; 'and I don't care, so that I don't set eyes on him again. I do believe that, if I had n't been just about as big and strong as he was, he would have killed me, and gone<pb n=""/> off with the horse and wagon; but I did n't like the looks of him, and I gave him to understand that I did n't, and that I was prepared for him; and when we passed through lots, to shorten the distance, I told him he must get out and let down the bars and open the gates, or I should turn round and come back. At first he thought to scare me, but he soon found that was not so easy done; so we jogged on together till about noon, when he and I parted company; and now all I have got to say is, I hope he will keep going until he gets so far that he will never reach here, if he attempts it.'</p> 
               <p>"Well, it passed on for about a fortnight, and we had pretty much forgot about the stranger, for we saw so many strange faces in the course of a week that we could n't remember all we saw; but one night, just about sundown, John and I were out swinging on the gate, when I happened to look up the road a little way, and there was Mr. Jeffers sitting on a pedler's wagon, by the side of a young man, who was talking away as busy and lively as if they was brothers. I jumped down from the gate and stood still a moment, and then both of us run into the house to tell who was coming; and as I did so I heard Jeffers say to his companion that they would go in and get supper, but he had better not have the horse taken out, as he would like to ride with him to the town above, where he would find plenty of customers, the next morning: and then I don't seem to have a very distinct idee about anything more that was done or said, only that both came in and took supper, and sat by the fire till the moon arose, and then they left. Joe was gone away from home that<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5991-00000051"/> evening; so after the stranger left I don't remember as there was anything more said about him. But during the winter one and another of the neighbors, as they dropped in, would have something to say about a strange man that kept coming over from town and inquiring the <emph>news</emph> of almost every one he saw. Some thought he was crazy; others thought he was a prying, impudent fellow, who took that way to find out other people's business; and so it went on until towards spring, when one day he was on Conanicut Island and saw a negro piling up stones in a field. He left the road and went over to where he was to work, and asked him if there was any news stirring. When the negro told him he had n't heard of any, he walked round for a little while, and then returned to his side, and asked if he had heard anything about a dead man being found. The negro dropped the stone he held in his hand, and was going to run away to the farm-house; for he had heard of this odd being's visits among the farmers, and he felt afraid of him. But the stranger told him to stop, and said that he heard there was a man who was trying to cross Narrow River in the winter, and he fell through and was drownded; and he was well acquainted with him, and if ever his body was found he should like to know of it. The negro looked into his face very steady a moment, and he thought of some of the stories he had heard, when all the negroes on the plantation gathered round the fire in his Aunt Debby's cabin, after their day's work, and he carelessly asked the stranger's name. At first he did not answer, and then, looking at Tom very fiercely, he said, 'If I tell you my name, I want you to promise<pb n=""/> me two things. First, that you won't tell it to anybody; second, if there ever is a dead body found along the shore of Narrow River, you will come over to town and let me know.' Tom was alone in the field, a good ways off from the house; and he did n't know hardly what he was about, he was so scared, and he promised him.</p> 
               <p>"'Jeffers,' said the stranger, 'is my name, and I live near the old mill, in Newport; so now remember your promise, or it may be worse for you.'</p> 
               <p>"Old Debby said that night when Tom came home he was frightened almost to death, and the next day no coaxing or driving could get him to go back to the field to work alone. But the field-hands only laughed at him, and told him they guessed he had crawled under the sunny side of the hay-stack, and gone to sleep and dreamed all this. But poor Tom only shook his head, and said he had n't told all the man said, but it was his 'pinion they would find out some day. And so it passed on until the spring opened, and the ice began to break up, and then, sure enough, there was a body found among the ice in Narrow River. As soon as the news spread around. Mr. Ashland, among others, went to see it; and no sooner did your grandfather put his eye on the body than he remembered the clothes that the pedler wore when he and Jeffers took supper at his house. The body had kept in a good state, owing to its being froze all winter, and the color of his clothes was n't changed, neither. There was the same large silver buckles that fastened his dark velvet small-clothes at the knee, which I suppose the murderer had forgot to remove; and the long<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5991-00000052"/> buff waistcoat, with two rows of large pearl buttons. There was a deep wound in his side, that told plainly that he had been killed before he was thrown into the water. Then they began to inquire and wonder who had done it; and each one had a tale to tell, but still all seemed confusion until Mr. Ashland came forward and said he thought he knew the body as that of a pedler, and then he told what he knew about him, and the man coming with him, but he could n't remember that man's name. So they agreed that one of their number should go over to town and ride through the streets and proclaim that the body of a man had been found in Narrow River, and there was marks on him that showed that he had been murdered, and all who thought they could give any information about the affair were requested to meet at the ferry-house, on the other side of the bay, at ten o'clock the next morning. The next day the little smack done a good business, and long before ten the ferry-house was crowded with visitors; and the body was put in a coffin, and placed on a table in this very room. The old elder that used to preach up to the little meeting-house on Tower Hill was here, and he exhorted for a long time, and told them what a dreadful deed had been done in our midst. Tom Dickson was here, and he did n't keep his secret any longer, but told what the stranger had said to him on Conanicut Island; but he had forgot the name, too. And then there was one old farmer arose and said it was his 'pinion that the murderer might be there in their midst, and that he thought it was that stranger that had come over to Narraganset so often during the winter, asking what was the news; and he got up on to a chair to see<pb n=""/> if he could see him, but he could not; and then he told how to find out, for people in them days was a great deal more superstitious than they are now, and believed in ghosts and witches, and all such sort of things, and a great many believed that if a murderer would place his hand on the corpse the wound would bleed afresh. Whether the old farmer believed in this or not, I can't tell; perhaps he done it to try the speriment, and see if any one hung back; but, at any rate, he proposed that the outside doors should all be closed but one, and after each one had touched the wounded side of the murdered man he should pass out. All seemed very willing to do this, except one old man, with long white hair, well powdered, and flowing to his waist, and with coarse gray whiskers, that nearly covered the lower part of his face. He said he thought this age was too 'lightened for such superstitions, and, for one, he should object to such nonsense. But the rest would all have it so, and then the old man was seen backing out into another room, and trying to make his escape through a window; but he was stopped, and there was a scuffle, in which the old man's white wig was torn off, and his false whiskers fell to the floor, showing the features of Jeffers. The farmers now thought he was the stranger who had been over so often asking the news, and Tom again repeated what he had said to him when he was to work in the field."</p> 
               <p>Lucy had become so interested in the story, that she had ceased to turn the large rim of the wheel, but had taken a little low stool close to the side of Prue, and drawn little Sammy on her knee; and even Edna seemed<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5991-00000053"/> to forget everything else, and sat with her eyes riveted on Prue.</p> 
               <p>"Nathan sick," said Freddy, pointing to him; "he all white."</p> 
               <p>"O! the Lord be praised, Nathan!" said Prue, stopping in her narrative, and looking into his face. "Why, I'm afraid you're going to be dreadful sick, you're taken so sudden."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, I guess not," said Mr. Ashland, rising, and going to his side. "It's only because he is sitting too near the fire after coming in from the cold." And he bade him remove his seat, and when he felt better to do up his chores and eat his supper, and then wrap up very warm, and go up into the sheep-cote, and secrete himself where no one would see him if approaching the yard.</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Nathan, rather confusedly, and taking a seat near Prue, while Mr. Ashland went out, saying he would go up to the square meadow and fodder the cattle, for it was drawing towards night. As the form of Mr. Ashland disappeared, Lucy laid her hand on Prue's arm, and asked her to finish the story about Jeffers and the pedler. Nathan, who had somewhat regained his color, looked around, and saw that Mrs. Ashland had left the room to begin some preparations for supper; so he turned to Prue, and in no very pleasant tone told her she ought to be in better business than telling such foolish lies to the girls, and frightening the children to death.</p> 
               <p>Prue tried to exercise a Christian spirit, and she thought she ought to endure much in silence; but this language from Nathan was more than she could bear,<pb n=""/> and she said, sarcastically, "Mr. Nathan Fossett, I shall say what I please, and if you don't like to hear me, why-there is plenty of room out doors! As for what I have said being lies, it is no such thing; for I remember just as well as though it was only yesterday all about seeing the murderer, and how frightened I used to be for years to pass by the place where he was hung and gibbeted. O, dear! it seems as if I could hear those awful chains creak now, as they used to when his body swung back and forth on the gibbet, away up above the gallows."</p> 
               <p>"And did he confess he was guilty?" asked Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," answered Prue, "and he said on the gallows that his conscience had tormented him so that it was a relief to die; and then he told how, on the road that night after he had left the ferry-house, he enticed the pedler into an old deserted house, by telling him that he knew the folks who lived there, and it had got to be so late he thought they had better stop there all night. At first the pedler was loth to go, but finally consented; and when Jeffers got him to the door he murdered him, and then dragged him off on to the ice. It had n't got to be very cold then, and the ice gave way, and he left the body there, and had n't been back to the spot since."</p> 
               <p>"How did he get acquainted with the pedler?" said Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"Well," continued Prue, "I think he said that he first spoke to him when he was riding along the road, and asked him to let him ride a few miles with him. The pedler consented, for you see folks used to become acquainted in those days a great deal easier than they<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5991-00000054"/> do now. It was a very common thing then, if you met with a man in a wagon, and you wanted to go the same way that he was driving, to get in and ride with him."</p> 
               <p>"And did the pedler have money?" asked Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, a little, but not near as much as Jeffers thought he had."</p> 
               <p>"Prue," said Nathan, fiercely, "don't you ever mention the name of Jeffers before me again; for, if you do, it may be worse for you!"</p> 
               <p>"And pray have n't I a right to talk, if I'm a mind to, Mr. Nathan, that you should get so mad about my telling of something that happened before you was born? One would think it was one of your relations I was talking about, to see you so put out."</p> 
               <p>"Relation or no relation," replied Nathan, "if you have much more to say about it, you will remember my words."</p> 
               <p>"I pity the gal that gets you for a husband!" retorted Prue. "For my part, I don't see where you come from, to bring so much impudence with you!"</p> 
               <p>"What is that you are talking about, Prue?" questioned Mrs. Ashland, who was just entering the room from the pantry, and had heard only the last remark.</p> 
               <p>"Why, I was just saying I did n't see where Nathan come from, to--"</p> 
               <p>"Why, your folks live over in town, don't they, Nathan?" said Mrs. Ashland, passing up to the fire with a cake in her hands to deposit before the coals.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered Nathan, mildly, and casting a triumphant glance at Prue, "I was born and brought up over there;" and then he added, meekly, "I never come into the house, when Prue is here, but she is<pb n=""/> always trying to say something to set you all against me. I am sure I don't know why she should; for I never did anything to injure her, or any one else."</p> 
               <p>"The Lord be praised, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland, if I said a word first! Did I, gals?" burst forth the honest-hearted negress, rolling up her large black eyes.</p> 
               <p>Lucy was about to speak in Prue's behalf, when Mrs. Ashland waved her hand for all to keep silent, as she would have no contention in the house, and each obeyed her. Soon Nathan buttoned his coat closely about him, and went out; muttering to himself, after he had shut the porch-door, that if Prue knew what was for her interest she would treat him with more respect, or some stormy night her little cabin should be lit up to serve as a beacon to guide some stately ship up the bay.</p>

               <p>EVERY day that Edna remained at the ferry-house, she seemed to make herself more useful; what she did not understand she learned so readily, and was always so pleasant and patient in whatever she undertook, that Mrs. Ashland declared she should feel very sad when she came to part with her, and Lucy could not have loved a sister more. Everywhere she went she desired Edna by her side, else she did not seem happy. And Richard, too, seemed to have found another friend, beside the farmer's daughter; but now there was no jealous feeling manifested by Lucy when he praised Edna's beauty, for she knew that she held the first place in his heart, and both regarded the fair stranger as a sister. Freddy, also, seemed as necessary to the happiness of the family as the old oak timbers to the<pb n=""/> stability of the farm-house. When Mr. Ashland returned from his labor in the field, and laid aside his coarse, warm coat, the boy would run with childish glee and climb upon his knee, and ask him when spring would come, and the wrens and swallows return to build their nests under the eaves and among the rafters of the low barn near the rocks; for the good man had told him of these things in the beginning of his sojourn with them, and the child was now growing impatient for the time to arrive. Yes, Freddy was the pet and favorite of all the household; even Nathan's guilty heart seemed to feel some generous impulses, as the boy would run to his side and search in his pockets for grains of golden corn, that he might drop them on the long-handled slice, and pop them over the fire; and often would Nathan place them there for that purpose. And Nathan loved to look at Edna, too, from beneath the visor of his rabbit-skin cap, for he was an admirer of beauty; but he seldom talked to her, for there was a reserve in her manner towards him that led him to suspect that she could read his true character better than the others, for she had apparently seen more of the world. Freddy would run to Nathan to search for corn; but when his little hands or apron were filled, with childish instinct he seemed to discern that his heart was unlike the rest of the household; and, if asked to remain, he would steal away slyly to Edna's side, and wait till Nathan was gone. Prue while sitting on the dye-tub had noticed this, but she mentioned it to no one but Cudjoe, for she had begun to fear as well as dislike Nathan, ever since his threatening words and manner at the time she related<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5991-00000056"/> the tale of Jeffers and the pedler. She thought it very strange that he should be so affected by the recital of a story, and began to think that the heat of the fire had not caused his pallor. But, then, all these circumstances occurred before he was born; and she came to the conclusion that it was nothing but his ugly temper, and that he was angry to think that she should presume to entertain the girls and engross their whole attention while he was present. She resolved to have but little to say to him in future, and thus avoid altercation, and she longed to tell Mr. and Mrs. Ashland what she thought of him; but she saw that he was quite a favorite with them, and that they would be unwilling to listen to aught against him.</p> 
               <p>Edna had resided at the farm-house about two months, and the depression that weighed upon her spirits seemed to have worn off; her manner had assumed a cheerfulness, and ere sunrise her voice was heard through the house, singing lively and pleasant songs, that were new and gratifying to the family, especially to Lucy, who never referred to the past, for she found that was the only way to keep Edna's face cheerful, and make her enjoy her home.</p> 
               <p>There was a thick layer of snow on the frozen ground, and when the family went up to the little meeting-house on the brow of the hill the glossy old white horse was tackled into the large high-backed sleigh; and the loud jingle of the heavy bells echoed across the water, much to the amusement of Edna and Freddy, to whom this style of riding seemed perfectly novel, and who often accompanied the farmer when the weather was mild enough to admit of it. One morn-<pb n=""/> ing the sun was shining brilliantly, making the crusted and untrodden snow across the meadows look like one continuous field of glittering diamonds; the excellence of the sleighing had been improved by a slight fall of snow during the night, and Mr. Ashland, robed in warm furs, drove around to the front door, and asked Freddy if he would like to take a ride. The child clapped his hands, and seemed overjoyed at the prospect, and then asked if Edna might go too.</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly, certainly, my little man," he replied. "There is room enough for Edna, Lucy, and mother, too, if she wishes to go. I am only going up to Tower Hill."</p> 
               <p>"O, I don't care about going, father," said Mrs. Ashland; "but I think it is a good plan to take the girls." And then she added, with a smile, and looking at Lucy, "They will work the faster when they come back."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," answered the girl, skipping across the floor on her way to her chamber to prepare herself, where she was soon followed by Edna, who seemed equally pleased.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going, my dear?" said Richard to Lucy, as she met him in the back entry coming in from the boat.</p> 
               <p>"O, I am going to ride with a gentleman," said Lucy, looking rather serious.</p> 
               <p>"Who is he?" he inquired, rather anxiously.</p> 
               <p>"O, somebody that I think a good deal of."</p> 
               <p>"Nathan?" said Richard, blushing, and he gazed into her face to see if she were joking; but she looked so serious, that he added, sadly, "I will not complain, Lucy; may you enjoy yourself."</p> 
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5991-00000057"/> 
               <p>"Jealous of father?" said Lucy, springing down from the stair she had ascended, and smiling roguishly. "I wonder what he would say to that!"</p> 
               <p>"Say as I do, that it is a pity I do not love you less," answered Richard.</p> 
               <p>"Well, he won't always think so, Richard; so, don't make yourself unhappy about it."</p> 
               <p>"How can I help it, Lucy, when I see him show such a decided preference for Nathan?"</p> 
               <p>"Nathan!" repeated Lucy, her lip curling with scorn; "I despise him more and more every day; and some time, when I can prove that my thoughts are not without foundation, father shall know them."</p> 
               <p>"Noble girl!" said Richard; "but do not try to tease me, Lucy; for my mind is so harassed with my love for you, that it transforms shadows into substance, and makes me tremble at the thought that I may have to leave you."</p> 
               <p>"And would not the ship that you sailed in hold another, Richard?"</p> 
               <p>The young man gazed into her face with a look so full of gratitude and love, that she resolved not to tease him any more, though her mood was ever playful; and as he drew her towards him, and left a kiss on her rosy lips, she did not resist. Neither had she noticed that Edna had passed into the entry and had observed the scene, and she was about to conceal her blushes in flight, when Edna, in a whisper, called her back, and told her that she had felt, ever since she came to dwell at the old homestead, that Richard and Lucy were born for each other.</p> 
               <p>At this moment, Mr. Ashland, who was standing<pb n=""/> within by the fire, called to his daughter to hasten her preparations, as the horse stood very uneasily at the door. In a few moments the girls were well wrapped in warm mantles, with hoods attached, and, with Freddy between them, were soon seated in the sleigh. As they wound up the wide cart-track that led to the upper road, the old white horse moved slowly along, as if reluctant to quit the warm barn and the manger of hay; but, as he struck out into the main road, the merry jingling of another set of bells seemed to attract his attention, and across the half-cleared wood-lot on the right he saw emerging into the open space the sorel horse belonging to Mr. Tripp. He and Sorel had often contested their speed when out upon the road, and driven by the young men of their respective farms. So, when the road-bars were let down, and Sorel fully through, it needed but a <emph>ged-a</emph> from Mr. Ashland to send old White, with a spring and a bound, along the glistening surface, while Sorel straightened himself to the track, determined not to be outdone. Each farmer was amazed at the celerity of his beast, nor could he think why one horse should have such an influence on the other. At length they came to the wide road that led off to Tower Hill; and when Mr. Ashland turned his horse's head in that direction, he looked back to see where were neighbor Tripp and Sorel. The worthy ferryman would not have dared to acknowledge, even to himself, that he had raced horses with his neighbor; but still there was a smile of triumph on his face, as he saw neighbor Tripp far behind, that would not have been there had he been in the rear.</p> 
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5991-00000058"/> 
               <p>The wintry wind blew fresh and chill as they passed along; but the sun's rays were warm, and served as an antidote, in part, sending the crimson flush of health to the cheeks of the girls, and bringing back the glow of youth to the face of the farmer. For the first few miles Freddy chatted and laughed in the exuberance of his joy; and then, as the novelty of the bells and the easy gliding of the sleigh became familiar, he gave himself up to silence, and then to sleep. The farmer looked back to inquire if his charges were warm and comfortable; and, after being assured they were, he drew his chin further down below the upper edge of his broad woollen scarf, and hummed an old psalm-tune, thinking of his crops, and what needed most to be done on the farm to prepare for the spring planting and sowing; and last, but not least, he thought of the red field-horse he was going to buy, and how much it were best to bid if it suited him. So he jogged on until they saw the sun glisten on the tall spire of the low-roofed meeting-house on the hill, and then he slackened his pace, and drove up to a small inn opposite.</p> 
               <p>"We will get out here, children," said the ferryman.</p> 
               <p>Edna gazed upon the low portal a moment; then, drawing herself back, she wrapped her mantle more closely about her, and said, "I think Freddy and I will not get out; I am not cold, and he is asleep, so I would as lief sit here while Mr. Ashland is transacting his business."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, child," said the farmer; "we will all stop here a while, and take dinner along with brother Browning. They are very good sort of people, and always have great welcome for me, or anybody I bring<pb n=""/> here; so, get right out and run into the great room on the right of the porch, there, and you will find some of the women-folks stirring about."</p> 
               <p>Edna looked imploringly at Lucy, as if she wished her to intercede with her father to let her remain; but, as she did not seem to observe it, and only urged her in still stronger language to get out, Edna reluctantly yielded, and, taking Freddy in her arms, accompanied Lucy in. It was not many minutes after they had entered the large square room, where a bright fire of hickory logs was blazing, for the accommodation of travellers, when Mrs. Browning entered. Edna gave a hasty glance to ascertain if she had ever seen the hostess before, and then, turning towards the fire, she took the tongs and placed on the iron forestick several blackened brands that had tipped into the corner. Then she again reached forward, and took down the Almanac that hung on a brass nail, and began to read and show the coarse wood engravings to Freddy.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Browning was a woman who looked as if she had never been forced to encounter any of the rougher storms of life, but had usually found a smooth sea on life's voyage. She drew her first breath on the soil along the banks of the Narraganset, and among its green hills and dewy pastures she had roamed with less of care than generally falls to the lot of humanity. What nature taught her, without effort on her part, she was willing to accept; but to glean wisdom from books she thought was lost time. To her it seemed far more profitable to stand at the spinning-wheel, or sit at the loom; and when she grew to womanhood she married one whose tastes coincided with her own, and<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5991-00000059"/> whose library consisted of a Bible,-which, though it had been in the house twenty years, was not badly worn,-a hymn-book, and every new year there was added to their shelves the Farmers' Almanac. But thrift and neatness were in every part of the house, from the potato-heap in the dark cellar, to the soft feather-beds in the half-high chambers. Mrs. Browning had no leisure moments; for dust, smut, or any shade on cloth, wood, or metal, were her abhorrence. When Saturday came, that day when the finishing touch is given to the week's labor, it was said that even the hooks on the crane were made to glisten in the hickory blaze; and so proverbial was Mrs. Browning's good housewifery, that often, after a bridal ceremony, the mother would say to her daughter, "Strive to imitate Mrs. Browning in your new home, and every year your dairy will increase."</p> 
               <p>But there was one characteristic of the landlady at the inn that no farmer's wife advised her daughter to emulate,-it was a wish to know and meddle in the affairs of others; but she did not seem to do this because she wished to injure, but solely from the love of gossip, and the force of habit, and because it served to fill the vacuum in her brain unsupplied by the lore of books.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Browning's stature was low, and her waist of such dimensions that a modern belle would never think of envying her; but there was always a pleasant smile about her face that made you forget her form; and thus it was with Edna and Lucy, as she entered the inn-parlor.</p> 
               <p>"How do you do, my dears?" she said, advancing<pb n=""/> towards the fire; then, stopping a moment, and looking at Edna, she added, "Why, 'pears to me I have seen you before;" and she crowded her spectacles closer to her nose, to assure herself of the young lady's identity.</p> 
               <p>Edna did not answer, but Lucy immediately replied that she guessed not, for she was a stranger on the Narraganset side, and had boarded at the ferry-house ever since she came, and had never been up that way before.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said Mrs. Browning, "perhaps I am mistaken; but she looks very much like a young woman that came here some time ago with her husband and child; and-I declare, the little boy looks like him, but"-and she gave another scrutinizing glance-"I guess he is a little bigger. But, I declare, how young she looks to be the mother of that child! I guess that is all the one you have got, an't it?"</p> 
               <p>"It is not hers," said Lucy, perceiving Edna's embarrassment, and wishing to dismiss the topic as soon as possible. But the inquisitive Mrs. Browning was not to be put off, and she exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"'T an't hern! why, bless me, whose can it be? I know it don't belong to anybody at your house."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he does," said Lucy, laughing; "he belongs to father, and is the pet of the ferry-house."</p> 
               <p>"Well, he was n't there a few months ago, when I was down there; so, just tell me where he came from, for I declare I should really like to know."</p> 
               <p>"He came from his own father's house," said Edna, with more spirit than Lucy had ever seen her manifest. She was surprised to hear her acknowledge that he<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5991-00000060"/> had a home, when she had so lately said that she herself had none. Appearances bespoke that he had been nurtured in wealth;-why was she there among strangers, alone, with him? All connected with Edna seemed a mystery; but still she was so kind, so noble, and ever striving to pursue the right, that Lucy could not believe she had been culpable. Perhaps, at some future time, when better acquainted with the ferryman's family, she might make them her confidants, and reveal her history. But Lucy loved her too well to pain her by asking questions; she tried not to evince her surprise, so as to elicit further questioning from Mrs. Browning; and, as she saw her father pass by the window to enter the front door, she felt relieved, for she knew the landlady would transfer her interrogatories to him, and would gain but little information.</p> 
               <p>"Why, how do you do, neighbor Ashland?" said Mrs. Browning. "I declare, how glad I am to see you! And how are things getting along at the ferry, and over in town?"</p> 
               <p>"Well," said the farmer, "the Lord seems to prosper us all. We have had a very good harvest, and the town's people seem to be in good health, and thus far the winter is unusually mild."</p> 
               <p>"The Lord is surely very kind," said the hostess, with her eyes in the direction of Freddy. "That is a nice child, but the gals here won't tell me who he belongs to; but I guess, if you know, you won't be afraid to tell me."</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Browning," said the farmer, "it is getting along towards noon, and I guess a mince-pie and some<pb n=""/> ham and eggs would n't come amiss before we bring old Whitey out of the barn."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Browning, seeing there was a better chance to gain a few shillings than information, smoothed down her broad checked apron, and hastened out into the kitchen to prepare the meal for her guests.</p> 
               <p>"Put up your work, Nancy, and come and help me," she said to a chubby, yellow-haired girl, of about eighteen, who sat on the dye-tub paring apples, and cutting them in quarters.</p> 
               <p>"What-say, mother?" said the girl, still continuing her occupation.</p> 
               <p>"Come right here, this minute, and help me get dinner!" said the mother, with a menacing air, but in smothered tones. "Neighbor Ashland is in the great room, with his darter and another gal, who's got somebody's young one to take care of. She must be plaguy sight fonder of young ones than I am, to take another person's!"</p> 
               <p>Nancy did not seem disposed to heed her mother's command, but rose and sauntered to the window, where she stood humming the tune of Polly Vaughn, and watching Robert Wright, the young shoemaker, who was walking briskly towards the little shop across the way. Nancy was an only daughter, who, as her mother said, "could work when she was a mind to, and always was a pretty smart gal until she went to school; but that had been the ruin of her, and now all she thought of was reading and writing, and such-like nonsense, that would never do any good. Book-larnin' did n't teach her how to make butter and cheese, nor how to knit and sew." But Mrs. Browning's animad-<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5991-00000061"/> versions fell as harmlessly on the ear of her daughter as the feathery snow-flake on the water; and when the eggs went hissing into the long-handled spider, Nancy still stood by the window singing Polly Vaughn.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>When dinner was ready, the hostess called her guests, but she was not as sociable as she would have been if they had been more communicative. When the meal was eaten, the old white horse was brought from the barn, and, after the customary compliments were exchanged, Mr. Ashland and his charge took their way homeward.</p> 
               <p>Another month, and more, had passed away, and Edna had heard nothing from Charles since he sailed from New York. The day he left there he wrote to her that he should send her a letter by the first ship that sailed after he arrived at Liverpool. He had had time to reach there, and send a letter by a vessel that was expected into Newport every day. Edna was anxiously awaiting its arrival, and often would she repair to the gray old rock and gaze seaward, to see if she could discern the white sails of the Cleopatra; but she was doomed to disappointment, and at length she ceased to visit the rock, and, in the solitude of her chamber, mourned over the delay, until one day, when Nathan came back from town, he said the long-expected ship, which had been detained by rough weather and contrary winds, had arrived. If Edna had not long since learned to control her feelings, she would have betrayed her joy; but to all save Lucy, who thought her morning tasks were more quickly<pb n=""/> performed, and who noticed a smile upon her lips more frequently than usual, she seemed the same quiet, pleasant girl.</p> 
               <p>After the dinner-table was cleared in the afternoon, Edna said she would like to leave Freddy for a while, and go over in the boat, if Mrs. Ashland had no objection.</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly, child," said the kind woman. "I think the sail will do you good; let me see, I believe you have n't been over to town since you came to live with us."</p> 
               <p>"No, I have n't," answered Edna pleasantly. "I have enjoyed myself here so well, I did n't care about going out. It will be hard to leave you next summer."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," answered Mrs. Ashland and Lucy, in a breath. "And, O dear!" continued Mrs. Ashland, "how lonesome we shall be without Freddy!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, don't worry, mother," said Lucy, "for maybe there will something turn up that they won't go."</p> 
               <p>Edna made no answer, but seemed to be busy with her thoughts, and she went to her room to prepare for her trip to town. It was not long before she was ready; and as she passed through the kitchen, on her way to the boat, she stopped to kiss Freddy, and said playfully to Lucy, "Who knows but that I shall catch a beau before I return?"</p> 
               <p>"You are pretty enough," thought Lucy as she looked into Edna's animated face; but she merely smiled, and wished her a pleasant time.</p> 
               <p>A moment more, and Edna was seated on one of the long wooden seats fastened to the side of the Swallow, while the sea-breeze filled her white canvas, and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5991-00000062"/> wafted her across the Narraganset Bay. There was but one other passenger in the boat, and when Richard took his seat at the helm he asked Edna to sit near him; so she left the side of the old man near the cuddy,-who was entertaining her by telling her how many times he had crossed the ferry, and who had been his fellow-passengers in some of his trips, and how different things looked now from what they did when he was young,-and, bowing politely, accepted Richard's invitation. He made a few commonplace remarks, and then, seeing the other passenger absorbed in viewing the group of small islands at the left, he said, "I never saw you look so happy before as you do this afternoon. Have you heard any news that thus revives your spirits?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said the girl blushing; "is it not enough to make any one happy to inhale this pure sea-breeze, and see the old farm-house in the distance, where we can return after our excursion, and meet with such good cheer and loving friends to greet us?"</p> 
               <p>"I know it," said Richard. "That picture would be enough to make one happy, if there were no darker shades on the canvas; that is, if we were sure that <emph>all</emph> were friends who dwell there; but do you not think there are some at the homestead who love neiyou nor me?"</p> 
               <p>"It may be so," answered Edna; "but I am not aware that I have done anything that should call forth such feelings, for I have tried to be kind to all."</p> 
               <p>"Kindness, Edna, will never tame the tiger. I think there is one at the ferry-house whose heart is foul, and<pb n=""/> it is sad to think that we have no means of proving its blackness."</p> 
               <p>Whom he meant was evident to Edna, and yet she feared to speak freely, for misfortune had rendered her distrustful.</p> 
               <p>Richard, seeing her embarrassment, added, in a lower tone, "You need not fear to give utterance to your thoughts, Edna. Heaven knows I would not harm you by betrayal."</p> 
               <p>Ressured by his words and tone of sympathy, she said, "Is it of Nathan you are speaking?"</p> 
               <p>"It is; for the mossy roof of the ferry-house shelters none other whose heart is not as pure as the breeze that bears us onward."</p> 
               <p>"You speak what I feel to be true, Richard, and I shall never forget their kindness towards Freddy and me this winter. It is not only the gifts they have bestowed, but their noble generosity in not indulging in vain suspicions towards a stranger who did not expose her secret sorrows, thinking it could benefit neither herself nor them. No, Richard, I shall never forget their kindness; and when I leave the farm-house, wherever my lot may be cast, I shall carry pleasant memories of my winter with the Ashland family."</p> 
               <p>"But when you go, Edna, you can carry him you love with you; but it is not so with me. She whom I love will still remain there when I leave."</p> 
               <p>Edna was about to speak of Lucy's devotion to him, but at this moment the old man seemed to awake from his revery, and, clinging to the taffrail of the boat, drew himself nearer to the young girl's side, and commenced conversation again. As they neared the shore, he<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5991-00000063"/> pointed out many places of interest, that without his guiding hand would have been unnoticed by Edna; the hanging rocks and the vine-clad alcove, facing the warm southern breeze, as in summer it wafted inland from its spicy home.</p> 
               <p>"There sat in former days beneath that rocky bower," said the intelligent old man, "one of Newport's first historians. He did not long remain in the town, but while he did he was a blessing to that place, and indeed to all who knew him. He loved to sit on the low, rocky bench within, and look out on the blue sea, while his thoughts expanded, and his hand traced them on paper. And there is Conanicut, or, as the Indians used to call it, Quonanicut, once inhabited and guarded by a part of the tribe of the Wampanoags."</p> 
               <p>Soon the Swallow swept gracefully up to the wharf, and Richard, springing to the shore, made her fast. He then extended his arms to receive Edna, for the tide was low, and it was difficult to ascend the inclined plank without assistance; and the lack of activity in the old man's limbs was not forgotten by the young and robust sailor, for, when Edna stood firmly on the land, he turned to help the other passenger to reach the shore in safety.</p> 
               <p>"Shall you go back with me the next trip?" said Richard to the fair girl beside him, as she was about to leave the wharf.</p> 
               <p>"I think not," she replied, "as I have some shopping to do, and wish to look about the town a little before I return."</p> 
               <p>"Very well," said Richard; and, as he slowly wound the hawser around the firmly-set post, he looked up,<pb n=""/> and his eyes followed her receding form until it was lost to his view. Then he mused to himself as he walked up the uneven walk to the little grocery at the head of the street, to see if there were any passengers in the little room appropriated to the Swallow's service, waiting to return. "Hers must be a strange history, methinks, as well as mine. Would that I knew it,-but God forbid that I should ever be inquisitive towards the unfortunate, when I have suffered so much from the idle curiosity and inquiries of the ignorant, that I could not answer satisfactorily."</p> 
               <p>Cold, gray winter twilight had begun to thicken on the water when Edna again made her appearance on the long, narrow wharf, where was moored the Swallow; but, O, how changed was her step! The vivacity of her manner was gone, and her dark eyes were swollen from weeping; and so different did she appear, that, though her costume was the same, Richard did not recognize her until she laid her hand on his shoulder, and pronounced his name,-and then his first exclamation was, "O, Edna! are you sick. You look very pale."</p> 
               <p>"No," said she, calmly, "but I am very tired, and want to go over as quick as I can."</p> 
               <p>"Well," said the young man, "the boat is all ready to start, and they will be very glad to see you at the house. I have not made a trip this afternoon, that I have not found Lucy on the rocks watching for your return. And Freddy, too, has repeatedly inquired for you."</p> 
               <p>Edna made no reply, but quickly sprang from the wharf on to the cuddy, and took the same seat she<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5991-00000064"/> left a few hours before with so light a heart. Had the other occupants of the boat known her thoughts, as she sat with her elbow on the taffrail, and her face buried in her hand, they would have shuddered to cross the bay in her society.</p> 
               <p>"O, Father in heaven!" she murmured, mentally, "spare me the sin of suicide! Take me to thyself without an effort from my own hand; for I feel as if I cannot live longer. <emph>He</emph> has deserted me; for I have proof beyond a doubt that his ship arrived ere this one left port, and yet she brings me no tidings of him. Did he not promise that, if God spared his life, he would write to me by the first returning ship?-and she now lies in port, but bears no message of joy to me! Better would it have been for me to have remained where I was, and where it seemed to be the study of those who should have cherished me to make me miserable, than to be situated as I am now. For I cannot go back now, if I would. <emph>Go back;</emph> did I say? Heaven forbid! Now that I have my liberty, I will strive with all my might to retain it. But, O, Freddy!-I could bear it all, if it were not for him! But, poor babe, he must not suffer for my folly; and yet I cannot restore him to his home, for his infant heart would never feel a mother's caress, and his loving words would but fall on a tyrant's ear."</p> 
               <p>And then she pressed together her eyelids as if she would close the avenues to her brain, and shut out the painful thoughts that strove for entrance. As she sat silent, she gradually became calmer, until the sea of inward commotion seemed to have been stilled by the voice of reason and reflection.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>When she came on board, Richard noticed that she looked ill and weary; but, as the sloop shot out upon the water, it required all his skill in the coming darkness to keep her in her accustomed track, and he could merely give an occasional glance towards her. He observed that she was deep in meditation; but passengers often crossed the bay in silence, looking out upon the scenery. As the boat approached the strand, Lucy was there to receive them; and, after Richard had passed Edna her bundle of purchases, the two girls walked up the path together.</p> 
               <p>When Freddy heard Edna's voice he sprang from Mr. Ashland's knee, and ran to her side, so happy to see her, and to tell her how he had passed the afternoon with Sammy and Prue, that she half forgot for the time the sorrow that weighed upon her spirits.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Edna, child, how tired you look!" said the kind-hearted Mrs. Ashland, going to her side, and helping to remove her bonnet and mantle. "The next time you go over to town, dear, you had better go in the morning, and then don't stay so long. It's very bad for anybody to be walking around in the cold that is n't used to it."</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Edna, pleasantly. And, taking Freddy by the hand, she led him up toward the dye-tub, where Nathan was sitting, who instantly arose and offered her his seat, which she accepted, and, taking the child on her knee, pressed him to her bosom, as if there were still one object to love who would not desert her.</p> 
               <p>After supper Edna excused herself from the fireside, pleading fatigue and a severe headache. And,<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5991-00000065"/> after Freddy was peacefully sleeping, she sought the window that overlooked the bay, and seated herself in the large arm-chair that Charles occupied the night before their last parting. Her thoughts we leave to the imagination of the reader.</p>

               <p>THE twinkling lights in the far-off town became extinct, and, when the full, round moon came up from her misty bed, there was but one lone watcher on the deck of the large ship at anchor in the bay opposite the old ferry-house; and still Edna sat at the window, viewing the soft rays of moonlight as they fell upon the shining tarpaulin worn by the traveller on the deep. Reader, there is no word in my vernacular, save GOD, that thrills upon my heart like the word <emph>sailor;</emph> for it brings memories of other days, when the silvery hair of my father floated out upon the breeze, as he paced the deck of the outward-bound. Yes, and I remember, too, the heavy hearts at home, as we stood upon the shore and watched the receding ship until the last speck of her mainmast was lost in the tear-drops that gathered on our lashes, in spite of all our efforts to restrain them. And who can picture the joy we felt at his return from a long voyage?<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5991-00000066"/>

               <p>Long she sat by the narrow-paned window, until she saw the lights go out in the distant town; and then she turned her gaze to the full, round sides of the floating ship, as she seemed to dance upon the waves; but she was aroused from her revery by the cries of the child, who seemed to be dreaming of home.</p> 
               <p>"No, no, mother!" he cried; "me will be good, and let you scold Lizzie, if you want to; and me will try to love brother, too, for farver says I must!" And then he sprang from the pillow, and, extending his arms, cried, bitterly, "O, Lizzie, take me, take me and let me be your boy!"</p> 
               <p>"I will, darling," said Edna, hastening to his side. "But don't cry,-Lizzie is here, and naught but death shall ever separate us."</p> 
               <p>Freddy opened his eyes, and gazed upon the pale, calm features of his protectress, as they were revealed by the light of the moon, and, clasping his arms around her neck, begged her not to leave him.</p> 
               <p>"I will not, darling," she said.</p> 
               <p>And she gently laid him upon his pillow, and lay down by his side to spend the remainder of the night<pb n=""/> in troubled dreams, and awake with fevered brow on the morrow.</p> 
               <p>A week passed away, and affairs went on as usual at the ferry-house. Meals were prepared with comfort and precision; the same neatness and order reigned throughout the house, and all were warmly clad. It was just a week from the time that Edna went over to Newport, and the day had drawn to a close, when all the family gathered around the hearth, except Edna, who was busying herself in the low-roofed washroom adjoining the kitchen. The door was standing ajar, and Freddy sat prattling on Mr. Ashland's knee, when the farmer said to Richard,</p> 
               <p>"Did you bring over the <title>New England Weekly Journal,</title> to-night?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Richard, handing him the newspaper.</p> 
               <p>"Now," said the old ferry-man to the child, "we will have a nice time reading the news that the last ship brought over from the mother country. Let me see-"</p> 
               <p>And he hastily ran his eyes along the paper, until he came to the columns devoted to the items from England.</p> 
               <p>Edna heard all that was said within; and so interested was she that she seated herself on the long seat fastened to the house-side behind the oaken table, where the field-hands sat in summer to partake of their meals. The ferryman read many little items of home, as he called it, and extracts from speeches in Parliament, and with eagerness learned what was said about the colonies by the lords and commons; for the<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5991-00000067"/> feeling that their liberties and sacred rights were being trampled upon was gaining strength.</p> 
               <p>At length Mr. Ashland was silent for a few moments, and still Edna kept her cold seat in the outer room. Soon she heard him say,</p> 
               <p>"Aylesbury-Aylesbury!-Why, Martha, is n't that the name of the young man who stayed here over night in the beginning of the winter?"</p> 
               <p>"Aylesbury!" repeated Mrs. Ashland, putting the end of her knitting-needle into her mouth, and looking steadily into the fire; "yes, I believe it was."</p> 
               <p>"I know it was," said Lucy; "for he was so handsome, I have always remembered him."</p> 
               <p>And Lucy gave a roguish glance at Richard, who was seated in the corner, studying navigation. The young man smiled as he heard her remark, and then went on with his studies.</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, child!" said Mr. Ashland, searching for the paragraph he was looking at before he spoke. "If he had only beauty to recommend him, I would n't give much for him; for a handsome face will soon fade away, and then what is there left to depend upon?"</p> 
               <p>"Impudence!" said Nathan, with a look of hate towards Richard, which was instantly changed for one of meekness, as he saw Mrs. Ashland slowly raising her eyes from her knitting, and he added, pleasantly, "Perhaps I spoke too rashly; but you know I never like to see anybody idle. And usually, when I have seen a man handsome, he has been a lazy coxcomb, or an impudent nobody, that sprung from nothing, and bids fair to come to nothing at last. Sometimes, when they are young, they try to marry rich, and take in<pb n=""/> some girl, who finds out too late that she has thrown herself away, and will either have to roam the world penniless with him, or return to her friends."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland was so honest herself, and so candid in speaking, that she did not suspect there was a hidden meaning to Nathan's words, and that every one was an arrow thrown purposely to wound the feelings of Richard; so she answered, pleasantly, "A girl must be silly, indeed, to marry for beauty; not but what a healthy, happy-looking face is very agreeable, but I hope when Lucy marries she will get some one who is honest, industrious, and capable of taking care of her when her parents are gone."</p> 
               <p>Lucy, hearing her mother introduce the subject of her marriage, felt emboldened to speak her thoughts, and, in a half-playful tone, she said, "Whoever I marry, mother, must be handsome, industrious, and generous-hearted; he must never indulge in conversation that he knows will wound the feelings of another, for the purpose of gratifying his spite." As she spoke, Nathan colored deeply; but, without appearing to notice his confusion, she continued, "He must have business enough of his own to be able to let other people's alone, and not try to make disturbance in families; because, if such an one tried to make me love him, I should only dislike him the more, and tell him to go at once."</p> 
               <p>"Why, child, what are you talking about?" said Mrs. Ashland. "I want to hear your father read, and he has n't told us yet what is said about Mr. Aylesbury." And she bent forward and touched her husband's arm, telling him not to read to himself, as she<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5991-00000068"/> wanted to hear the news, and asked him what made him inquire about Mr. Aylesbury.</p> 
               <p>As Richard heard the sarcastic words of Nathan, and met his fiendish look, he felt moved to reply; but, considering that words would do no good, he endeavored to remain calm. He knew that it had often been said that he was handsome; but to his noble mind it bore no weight, and he had remarked to Nathan, when they were talking, ere his jealousy had crushed out all of his better nature, that it was to the moral worth of a man one must look, and not to his features. Never, for a moment, had he intended that Lucy should leave her home and share his uncertain lot with him, and he was about to rise and leave the room, when Lucy's voice kept him, as if transfixed, and, as her words fell upon his ear, they soothed and pleased him.</p> 
               <p>After Mr. Ashland had finished reading the article that riveted his attention, he again found the item about Mr. Aylesbury, and read:</p> 
               <p>"Fell overboard from the ship King Charles, while at sea, in a heavy gale of wind, Mr. Charles Aylesbury, of London, Eng., and was drowned."</p> 
               <p>At this moment there was a noise in the wash-room, as if something had fallen from the table to the floor.</p> 
               <p>"Lucy," said Mrs. Ashland, "you go drive the cat out of the sink-room. I guess she has knocked the bread-bowl down off the table,-she is a dreadful mischievous creature."</p> 
               <p>"I will go," said Nathan, rising; "I am nearest the door." And he took one of the bayberry candles from the table, and went out into the back room, closing the door after him. For a moment he set the light on<pb n=""/> the table, and looked on the scene before him. Edna had not fallen on the floor, but she lay prostrate on the long, wide seat, with her face upturned, and every feature the hue of death. Her eyes were closed, and her breathing seemed almost suspended. Nathan gazed on her beautiful features, and dark, glossy curls, which had broken loose from their confinement, while her large tortoise-shell comb lay on the floor in fragments. He did not seem grieved nor surprised; but there was a peculiar expression about his mouth that, under any other circumstances, might have passed for a smile, although it would seem almost sacrilege to suppose that he could take pleasure in seeing so helpless a being before him in unconsciousness. Cautiously lifting the end of the large table one side, he passed in beside her.</p> 
               <p>"Edna," he whispered in her ear; but there came no answer, and, after waiting a while, and finding that she did not arouse, he listened, to assure himself that the family were still seated by the fire, and then, lifting her in his arms, bore her up the back stairs to her chamber, and laid her on the bed. Then he went quietly down stairs, and returned with the candle he left on the table. Placing it where it did not shine directly on her features, he went to the side of the bed, to see if there were signs of returning consciousness; but still she lay calm and cold. Advancing to her side, he whispered "Lizzie, Lizzie, dearest! <emph>he</emph> is dead now, and I have come to claim you," and stepped back, to watch the effect of his words. Presently there was a convulsive struggle of the muscles, and then she opened her eyes and looked wildly around.<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5991-00000069"/> But the drapery of the tall posts concealed Nathan from her view, while he, from between the folds of the curtains, watched her every movement, and caught every sound that fell from her lips.</p> 
               <p>"O," she murmured, "what a dreadful dream I have had! I dreamed that Charles was dead, and then I thought that he was here and told me of another's death, that did not cause one pang to him or me." She pressed her hand to her temples, and tried to recall the past; and, in a moment, the reality burst upon her, and she remembered what Mr. Ashland had read. She tottered to the window and threw herself into the arm-chair. As she did so, she espied the form of Nathan, and exclaimed, "O, Nathan! how came you here, and who gave you liberty to enter my room?"</p> 
               <p>"No one," returned the young man, pleasantly; "but I went into the sink-room and found you sleeping in the cold, and, as you did n't awaken readily, I brought you up stairs, for a joke."</p> 
               <p>This explanation seemed to afford relief to Edna; for she thought, if the farmer's family knew of her agitation at the time Mr. Ashland read of the accident, it would create the suspicion that she had known him, and they would think it strange that she did not acknowledge the acquaintanceship the night he was their guest; and she replied, "Some other time, Nathan, perhaps I might enjoy a joke; but I do not feel well to-night, so you will leave my chamber, if you please."</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly," said he, with a smile; and he walked towards the door. But he did not immediately raise the wooden latch, lingering, as if there were some-<pb n=""/> thing he wished to say. Then, crossing the floor again, he said,</p> 
               <p>"Why is it, Edna, when I do all I can to deserve your esteem, that you persist in treating me so coldly? I do not mean to be selfish; but I wish you did not let Lucy influence you to think of me as she does. She did not dislike me until Richard Conworth came here, and I am no worse now than I was before he came. I know you are here alone with Freddy, and if, at any time, you should want a favor of me, you have only to ask."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you," she answered, calmly; "I never heard Lucy speak ill of you, and I think, if you are kind to Richard, he will be the same to you; but, as for myself, Mr. Ashland's family are so generous and kind, that I lack for nothing to make me comfortable." And she repeated the request that he would leave her chamber, which, after bidding her good-night, he did.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan had closed the door, Edna drew in the latch-string, and, seating herself again by the window, wept bitterly. Still the thought was soothing, as she sat and looked out upon the ocean in the distance, that she had not been deserted and neglected by him she loved; and, in her loneliness and bereavement, there was solace in the reflection that he died true to her.</p> 
               <p>The meridian of night was past ere Edna sought her pillow. Once she heard Lucy come to the door and try the latch; but she did not answer, for she felt as if she could not speak without betraying her emotions. Of late, Freddy had often slept with the ferryman, for he said the chamber was too cold for the child; so she<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5991-00000070"/> knew he would be made comfortable if she did not go below.</p> 
               <p>After Mr. Ashland had finished reading about the drowning of Mr. Aylesbury, he laid down his paper, and talked with his wife on the uncertainty of human life, and how necessary it was to be prepared, at all times, for death; and ended by observing that the ways of the Lord were mysterious in removing one so young, when it seemed as if he might be the means of doing so much good, if he could have been spared to the world. They sat some time and conversed in this way, when Nathan returned to the room.</p> 
               <p>"Where is your light, Nathan?" said Mrs. Ashland. "Did you leave it out in the wash-room?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Nathan; "I met Edna on the back stairs, and she was coming in after one to go to her room; so I let her have that."</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" exclaimed the farmer's wife; "she has never felt very well since that day she went over to town. She was out too long, and I think she caught cold walking around so much." And then she told Lucy she had better go up, before she went to her room, and see if she wanted anything.</p> 
               <p>Lucy said she would; and then the old ferryman trotted Freddy on his knee, and gave him some chestnuts that had grown on the old tree up the road.</p> 
               <p>"Me sleep with you," said Freddy, as if to show that he appreciated the gift; "and to-morrow you let me go up to Pue's, in the cart, to see Sammy."</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Mr. Ashland, smiling; "when I go along to the wood-lot, I will take you, and let you stay and play with Sammy till I come back."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Me love you dearlier than farver," said Freddy, gathering the chestnuts into his apron, and reaching some to each of the group; "and now me give you a kiss to pay." Then, after eating his chestnuts, he inquired for his warm flannel night-dress, and was soon sweetly sleeping.</p> 
               <p>When Lucy had laid him on the pillow, she went up to tell Edna that he was in her father's bed, and to see if she wanted anything for her cold, as her mother had directed; but when she found the latch-string drawn in, she made no further attempt to arouse her, going quietly to her own room, where she was soon wrapped in that peaceful forgetfulness which the wakeful eyes of Edna in vain coveted.</p> 
               <p>One after another of the group around the hearth-stone disappeared, until there was no one left but the ferryman and his wife. As the bright blaze that had illuminated every part of the room was on the wane, he changed his seat to the dye-tub, that he might feel the genial heat without replenishing the fire, and quietly beckoned for his wife to draw her chair nearer. Mrs. Ashland laid by her knitting-work, and did as her husband desired. For a little while neither spoke; the farmer gazing fixedly at the fire, and his wife looking wonderingly into his face, and waiting silently for him to commence the conversation. At length he passed his arm over her shoulder, as he had often done in times gone by, and said,</p> 
               <p>"Martha, I have been thinking of Edna and Freddy to-day."</p> 
               <p>"And don't you think of them every day, John?" exclaimed the wife.</p> 
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5991-00000071"/> 
               <p>"Yes, every day; but more particularly this day. We all love them, and have become so attached to them that we would be willing to do almost anything to make them happy."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland acknowledged that was true by a slight inclination of her head, and he continued, "We have tried hard to make them happy, but as yet we have failed to make Edna so, however much she may try to appear cheerful; and now there is one thing I want you to do. I want you to strive to gain her confidence, not to gratify curiosity, but for the purpose of making her happier. If she has secrets that she does not wish exposed, make her feel that if they are confided to you they shall go no further. You need not tell even me, for I have but one aim, and that is to make her happy; but all our efforts will prove fruitless, unless we can do something to relieve the secret sorrow which I feel preys upon her heart. When she came here, she said she had no home; perhaps this is the reason that she looks so sad at times, and her eyes fill with tears when we speak about their leaving us."</p> 
               <p>"I did not notice that she did so when we mentioned about her going away until a few days ago, and then I thought it was because she did not feel well that she seemed so affected," said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"It may be so," said the husband; "I am sure I don't want them to leave us; for, to tell you the truth, wife, though I don't want to complain of anything Heaven has decreed, I have always felt disappointed that we never had a boy; and this little fellow seems to have been sent to make up the deficiency.<pb n=""/> Now, if they have no other home, I want them to stay with us; and, some time, you can speak to her privately about it, and tell her to look upon you as a mother. And I shall provide for her as if she were a daughter; for the Lord has been very kind to us, and there will be enough for Lucy and her too, and I trust they never need lack when I am gone."</p> 
               <p>"I shall do so, John," said the wife, wiping the moisture from her eyes with the corner of her apron; and then she added, feelingly, "I have not thought so much of these things before; but now I do remember that at times she seems melancholy, and I have often seen her wipe away her tears when she has been caressing the child. Some day, when we are alone, I will by degrees bring it around in such a way that perhaps she will tell me why she is alone among strangers with this child; and then I will offer to take them as our own children."</p> 
               <p>"And there is one thing more," continued the farmer; "if she consents to stay with us, I want her to receive a certain sum each month for her services; for she is so retiring that she would suffer before she would ask for money or clothes. And, besides, I think it is our duty to do this, for she makes herself very useful about the house with the needle, and in other ways; and it will have a tendency to make her more independent and free, for she is too timid to be happy.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland readily agreed to this, and they talked on till she complained of the room growing chilly; and then he raked a deep hole in the ashes, and piled in the large live coals, covering them with the warm ashes<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5991-00000072"/> and deadening embers. Then he hung his heavy boots high up on the crane, that they might be warm for the morning, and retired to rest.</p> 
               <p>The following morning little Freddy was up with the dawn, and, well wrapped in woollens, was out with a basket of corn to find the early-risen poultry; and then he accompanied the farmer to the barn, in mimic usefulness assisting in taking care of old White. When the sun rose bright and clear, he went in and inquired for Edna. As she had not yet come down, he went to her chamber and tried to open the door; but, the latch-string being in, he grew impatient, and called loudly for her to open the door.</p> 
               <p>In a moment the door was unclosed, and the girl, in a low tone, told him not to make a noise, for she was sick.</p> 
               <p>"O, dear me!" said the child, scarcely above a whisper; "I so sorry! But come down by the fire-that make you all well."</p> 
               <p>"I can't," replied Edna; "my head aches too hard."</p> 
               <p>Freddy looked into her face, and, seeing her look so sad, held out his hands for her to take him; but when she endeavored to raise him from the floor, her brain grew dizzy, and she left him and reeled back to the bed. Anxiety and sorrow had done their work, and she was now prostrate. Freddy screamed with fright when he saw Edna fall back upon the bed senseless; and soon Mrs. Ashland and Lucy were by his side, thinking he had fallen. But their cheeks blanched when they saw the pale features and passive form of Edna.</p> 
               <p>In a few moments Nathan was despatched for Prue, and a porringer of herb-tea was steeping by the fire; but in this instance neither availed. The next day<pb n=""/> she was worse; her bed had to be drawn up near the fireplace, and a fire kindled on the hearth. All that night Prue watched beside the invalid; and the kind-hearted negress said she must have had very bad dreams, for all night she was talking in her sleep, and once she attempted to spring from the bed, saying that she was drowning. And then she shrieked and called a name, which in her alarm Prue had forgotten.</p> 
               <p>Thus passed several days, and, in spite of Mrs. Ashland's and Lucy's tender care, and Prue's skill, Edna grew worse, until it was resolved to send for Doctor Layton, who resided at Littlerest Hill. Nathan almost every hour inquired after the patient; and Mrs. Ashland remarked how kind-hearted and anxious he seemed about a stranger, and contrasted his manner with that of Richard, who seldom asked about Edna. But the farmer's wife appeared a little surprised, when, at the edge of the evening, she asked him to go for the physician, and he wished to know if she could n't wait till morning, alleging the distance and the lateness of the hour as an excuse. She did not repeat the request, but resolved that the doctor should be sent for early in the morning.</p> 
               <p>Richard was in an outer room and heard the conversation, but he said nothing then. When the Swallow was secured for the night, he called Lucy aside, and told her that if they would like to have the physician brought from Littlerest, he could go and be back again in a few hours; and, if they were willing, he would put the saddle on old White, and start directly.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Richard," said Lucy, "we think it necessary that the doctor should come; but mother did not like<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5991-00000073"/> for father to go after him alone, and Nathan did not seem willing to go."</p> 
               <p>"Well, never mind, dear; you know that a sailor is used to cold, and late hours; and, besides, I want to see Edna about again. It seems very lonely not to hear her voice, and see her smile, when we all gather around the hearth in the evening."</p> 
               <p>"So it does," replied Lucy, with tears glistening in her eyes; "and I will go and see if mother thinks it best for you to go to-night."</p> 
               <p>In a few moments the young girl returned, and said her mother would be very glad to have him go; and soon the saddle was on old White's back, and he galloping up the road.</p>

               <p>NATHAN, at the ferry-house, slept in a small chamber where one window overlooked the water. He occupied it alone,-for it was his desire when he came there,-saying that he was an only son, and had always been accustomed to room alone, and that he would rather work for less wages than share his room with another. It was not inconvenient to grant this request; for the old house was large at the base, and its chambers were numerous, though some of them were small, and the roof not far above them.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan left the family circle, the evening that he refused to go for the doctor, he went to his room, and, when he had fastened the door, drew up a small, round stand beside his bed, and placed the burning candle in the centre; then, assuring himself that all parts of the window-panes were covered in his little corner bed-room, he seated himself in a low, leather-bottomed chair, beside the table, and leaned his head on his hand, as if his brain had been too active, and<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5991-00000074"/> was now oppressed with pain. In this position the young man sat for some time. At length he looked up, and, drawing the light a little nearer, gave a cautious glance around the room, to make sure that he was alone. Nothing met his view save the long rush curtains and plain furniture; and, being satisfied that no one was present, he took from his pocket a large and apparently well-filled pocket-book, and laid it on the table. As he looked at it, the half-sad expression passed away from his face, and, clutching it eagerly, he laid the inside bare, and, giving a triumphant look at the heavy roll of bills, exclaimed,</p> 
               <p>"Ha! Nathan, you have played a deep game; one that pays well, however, in the way of money;-but, after all, if there were any other way of getting rich, I should like it quite as well. The world in general thinks me honest, and I mean to enjoy its good opinion while I may. But I despise the world, and all mankind-I scarce know why, unless it be for the punishments it inflicted on my ancestors. Prue's story was indeed true. My grandfather, William Jeffers, did die upon the gallows, and afterwards his body was exposed to the fowls of the air on a gibbet. But neither she nor Mr. Ashland's family know that a drop of his blood runs in my veins. O! how often have I heard my father tell the tale, till it made my blood chill to see the hatred flash from his eyes, as he vowed vengeance to all mankind! And well he kept his word. But he committed depredations on the sea, and died on the scaffold in England.</p> 
               <p>"But one who knew said that each generation grows wiser; so I shall be safe, and use surer means<pb n=""/> to enrich myself, without being in danger of ending my days on a scaffold. Yes, I shall persevere until my coffers are filled to repletion. Mr. Ashland and his wife think that the homestead will make Lucy rich. Ha, ha, ha! Should it ever come into Richard Conworth's possession, the midnight torch would soon destroy all the noble architecture on the farm. And should I wish her to share beggary with him? Yes; for, if she marries Richard, I can tell her she married the one she loved. And the cattle might have some fatal disease spread among them, which would be attributed to the agency of witches; and who more fitted for this office than Prue? Yes, indeed; this would be readily believed, and she would meet with the punishments she deserves. She should have been homeless before now, if I had not known that the Ashlands would admit her as a permanent member of their family; and I should not want her here all the time with her restless tongue. It is plain that she is prying into my affairs; but it will take more penetration than she has, to read the heart and acts of <emph>Mr. Nathan Fossett.</emph> Ha, ha, ha! Suppose I had called myself Jeffers!</p> 
               <p>"Well, now, let me see how generous Charley has been to his <emph>dear Lizzie;</emph> for, since I received it, I have not dared to touch it until now. But it has had a secure home in my old chest, with its lock of curious workmanship. Everything so far has worked as I anticipated, and she thinks him dead. 'T is well; for at present he is dead to her. Most noble Faust! I thank thee for the art of printing; for within the last week it has served my purpose well. A good fee paid the printer's boy to take the notice to the office, and<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5991-00000075"/> be sure to have it inserted, and now I am master of-let me see how much."</p> 
               <p>And Nathan counted and recounted the contents of the package that crossed the sea but a short time previous in the brig Cleopatra.</p> 
               <p>"Well, that will do for this time," he said, as he slowly folded the bills, and replaced them in his pocket-book.</p> 
               <p>"And now, I guess, if the old man can spare me to-morrow, I will go over to Newport, and see <emph>my mother;</emph> that is, Mr. Ashland must think it is my mother that I go to see,-for he knows nothing about my little dark-eyed Monieda. I wish I were capable of loving that girl as she loves me; and then again I ought not to, for she is poor, and that does not suit my purpose. I have made up my mind that when I take a wife, <emph>I</emph> must either have wealth enough for us both to live a life of luxury, or else <emph>she</emph> must bring me sufficient for all future purposes. But Monieda don't know this, neither must she. I would sooner give pain to every other than to her, for she is so good and kind that sometimes she makes me think it is pleasant to be loved. But I think it must be growing late now; so I will place the letter and the money in the old oak chest again, and it would take a strong arm to gain entrance there without this key."</p> 
               <p>And, when he had passed the wide leathern strap around the swelled sides of his pocket-book, he arose and carefully laid it and a neatly-folded letter in the till of his chest, and then retired to his pillow. Nathan's sleep was not of that quiet kind that would cause him to court it until a late hour; so, although<pb n=""/> the fowls crept up to the peak of the corn-crib long before he sought his pillow, he was up and in the barn-yard before them.</p> 
               <p>"That Nathan is a smart boy," said Mr. Ashland, peering through the early twilight, "for, although it must be very early, he is up and doing his chores."</p> 
               <p>"Do you think he is any smarter than Richard?" said his wife.</p> 
               <p>At first the farmer did not seem inclined to notice her remark; but, as Mrs. Ashland repeated the question in a rather louder tone, he was forced to acknowledge that he heard her, and he replied, thoughtfully,</p> 
               <p>"Well, in some things I think he is. He is an earlier riser."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland waited a few moments to see if her husband would say more, for she seemed not to feel entirely satisfied with his answer, and then she again interrogated,</p> 
               <p>"Well, do you think Nathan is smarter after he gets up?"</p> 
               <p>The old ferry-man stopped to draw up his long stockings, and fasten the silver buckles that kept his small-clothes well adjusted at the knee; then, drawing a long breath, he said,</p> 
               <p>"Richard is a very good sailor, and runs the Swallow better than any boy I ever had. It is very seldom I have to go over in her now; all the passengers seem to like him, and I believe he is very honest, and that I receive all the boat earns. I have always been very glad to think that the captain sent him ashore that time to buy butter and eggs for the ship."</p> 
               <p>"And so was I," interrupted the wife; "for I have<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC5991-00000076"/> noticed that you feel so much easier about the ferry ever since he concluded to remain with us; but I guess I will get up now, and go see how Edna gets along."</p> 
               <p>"Prue staid all night, did n't she?"</p> 
               <p>"O, yes; I shall have her remain until she gets better. I was up with her the fore part of the night; poor child! I think it's a chance if she ever gets well."</p> 
               <p>"The Lord's will be done, Martha!" said the kind-hearted man, with a sigh. "Come what may, we must submit; but I wish we knew more about her; for, if she dies, Freddy can never know who his parents are, and besides, as small as he is, he would take her death very hard."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, husband; but a child's grief is never lasting, and as for his caring about his parents, why, he need never know but what he belongs to us, for it is n't likely he will ask any questions about it, and it is nothing that concerns anybody else."</p> 
               <p>The old farmer again looked out towards the barnyard, and there seemed to be a shade of anxiety on his brow; and then he leaned over the pillow, and lightly touched his lips to the cheek of the sleeping child.</p> 
               <p>As Mrs Ashland entered Edna's chamber, the invalid seemed to be asleep; and, quietly approaching Prue, she said, in a whisper, "How has she rested since I left the room?"</p> 
               <p>"O, bad enough, poor child! turning first on one side and then on the other, and every now and then talking about something that I guess she don't know<pb n=""/> anything about, nor I either. O, dear! I was so afraid, one spell, I was a good mind to come down after you, she looked so kind of wild like. You know that she has got such large, dark eyes, and they always look bright; but 'pears to me they never looked so bright before as they did to-night."</p> 
               <p>"It is fever, Prue, that made them look so glossy." And the farmer's wife leaned over the pillows, and softly laid her hand on the cheek of Edna, whose slumbers seemed now to be peaceful; then turning again to Prue, she took a seat by the fire, near the faithful old nurse, and both conversed in a whisper.</p> 
               <p>"What did the doctor say, Prue, while I was down stairs?"</p> 
               <p>"O, he said she was a very sick gal, and he thought it was very doubtful if she ever got any better; and he said her mind wandered a great deal, though sometimes she seemed to know what was going on. But don't say anything,-if it was n't wicked to think so, I should say she did n't seem to care much whether she ever got well or not."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland had not time to answer; for Freddy had missed her, and, creeping from the bed, followed her to Edna's chamber in his night-clothes, and was now at the door, trying to lift the latch. Before Prue could reach his side, and beg him to be quiet and not awaken Edna, his voice had aroused her, and, turning her eyes in the direction of the door, she beckoned for him to come to her.</p> 
               <p>The child's eyes filled with tears, as he saw her pale features, and, slowly walking to the arm-chair beside<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5991-00000077"/> the bed, he climbed up and laid his face on the pillow. Edna feebly returned his caress, and, without speaking, drew the drapery of the bed a little nearer to her face, thus hiding it from the view of her nurse and kind benefactor.</p> 
               <p>Presently Prue said, "If you are willing, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland, I guess I will run up the road a little while, and see how my old man and Sammy get on; but I won't be gone long, and I guess Edna won't want anything till I come back, excepting that powder that is in the tin comb-case under the glass. I put it there so as to know it from the rest, for the doctor said it must be given at eight o'clock this morning."</p> 
               <p>"Very well, Prue, you can go; but I would like to have you come back again as soon as you can, for you know so much more about sickness than I do. You might bring Sammy back with you; he will be company for Freddy."</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Prue, pleased with the compliment that came from the lips and heart of the ferryman's wife.</p> 
               <p>After Prue was gone, Mrs. Ashland approached the bedside, and held a cup of warm drink to the invalid's lips, and then asked if she could do anything more for her comfort.</p> 
               <p>"No," said Edna, in a weak voice; "I can never half repay you for what you have done already."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't talk so, child! There is payment enough in the doing of a good deed; but, if you will not feel lonesome, I will go down stairs and help Lucy a little while about the breakfast. Poor child! she is so worried about you, she don't feel like doing much."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Edna's lip trembled, and then she said, slowly, "I am better this morning, and I think I can get along now without putting you to the trouble of staying up here."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, child; we don't expect you to do that. I shan't stay long, and if you want anything, why, Freddy will trip down and tell us,-won't you Freddy?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, me will," said the child, again embracing Edna.</p> 
               <p>After Mrs. Ashland left the room, Edna slowly raised her head from the pillow, and looked around, to convince herself that she and Freddy were alone. She had but just time to see that no one was present, when her brain began to grow dizzy, and she sank upon the pillow. It was some moments ere she recovered sufficiently to speak to the child, who lay wondering at her silence.</p> 
               <p>"Do you love me, darling?" she at length said.</p> 
               <p>"Me do, best of anybody."</p> 
               <p>"Then what will you do if I die, and you can never see me any more?"</p> 
               <p>"Die, die," repeated the child; "what is die?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't you remember when one died who loved you just as I love you now, and how you cried when she lay in the box, and would not wake up when you kissed her? It was but a little while ago, and you are nearly three years old now. And then I cut off a flaxen curl and gave it to you, and you used to look at it every day, and ask when she would come back; but she never came, nor will she." And Edna covered her face with her hand, and the hot tears gushed through<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5991-00000078"/> her slender fingers, until the child, overcome with grief, yet scarcely knowing why, sobbed aloud; and then the young woman tried to subdue her own emotions, and console him. By her caresses she checked the outward expressions of grief; but his mind was precociously active, and, after a few moments' quiet, he said, tenderly,</p> 
               <p>"Me do know now; she was handsome, and used to cry just like you; and father did n't love her, so she went away. Is that die?"</p> 
               <p>Edna was too much affected to reply; and, as she pressed her almost transparent hand to her burning temples, Freddy continued,</p> 
               <p>"Then you and me did die too; because we went away, and left that naughty man."</p> 
               <p>Edna did not try to recall to his mind any more of the past; for she saw that he was too young fully to comprehend what she wished to convey; and she told him, in as cheerful a voice as she could command, that if she went away, and never came back, he must be good, and call himself Freddy Ashland, and be Mr. Ashland's boy.</p> 
               <p>Freddy, with a childish frankness, and a desire to make her happy, said he would; but that she must not die and go away, for if she did he would have to die and go after her.</p> 
               <p>Traces of tears were still on Edna's face when Mrs. Ashland returned to the bedside; but she did not seem to notice them, and, after adjusting the pillow, and doing various little acts to make the invalid more comfortable, she told Freddy that Mr. Ashland had finished putting a new seat into Lucy's high chair, and was<pb n=""/> now waiting to have him come and take breakfast with him. At first the child clung to Edna, and did not appear inclined to go; but, after receiving a promise that he should return when breakfast was over, he was persuaded to accompany Mrs. Ashland down stairs.</p>

               </epigraph> 
               <p>TOWARDS the close of the day after Nathan had sat in his chamber till near midnight counting his banknotes and soliloquizing upon his gains, he sought Mr. Ashland's side, as he was working in the field, and asked if he could be spared until the next day, as he wished to go over to Newport, having heard that his mother was not very well.</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly," replied the farmer, evidently pleased at this fresh proof of his filial devotion; "and when you come back I guess we will open another potato-hole, out in the beech-lot; so you might look round a little, while you are over in town, and see if you can find a market for them. You need n't be afraid to recommend them, for you remember we dug the<pb n=""/> hole very deep, and they have lain all winter down below the frost, in good sandy soil."</p> 
               <p>"I will do the very best I can for you, I assure you, Mr. Ashland," replied Nathan, respectfully; "and, unless my mother is very sick, I will be back to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Very well," said the ferryman, resting his chin on the end of his iron bar, with which he was prying up stones, and looking after the young farmer. Then, as he resumed his work, he muttered to himself, "I wish he and Lucy would take a fancy to each other. It is doubtful whether I could ever get a better son-in-law; he is so capable, and seems so ready to be of service to me." Leaning again thoughtfully on the strong bar, he turned his eyes in the direction of the old ferry-house, from whose stone chimney he could just discover the smoke issuing, and then, glancing over his broad acres, seemed to be meditating upon the value of his property.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan had cleared the high stone wall in the distance, he quickened his pace until he reached the back porch; then, going up to his room, he divested himself of his farmer's suit of mixed sheep's gray, and substituted one of fine English broadcloth, with a bright scarlet waistcoat, trimmed with gilt buttons, and, donning one of the most fashionable hats of the day, seated himself by his window to watch for the starting of the Swallow. But, immediately rising again, as if he came near forgetting some important matter, he took from the pocket of his working suit a key of curious workmanship, unlocked the little old oaken chest of which we have spoken, and drew forth the huge pocket-book that he had so strongly strapped<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5991-00000080"/> with leather the night before. Sinking it deep into his pocket, he muttered to himself, "Won't Monieda and the boys wonder at my sudden rise to fortune? But I am pretty good at invention, so I can soon make it all plain. Some old uncle died-or, a part of it was a present for extra services, and then I speculated and got the rest. But there goes Dick down to the pier with half a dozen passengers. If nobody was going over but him and me, I should be almost tempted to give him a bath in cold brine before we reached the other side."</p> 
               <p>Almost alarmed lest his words had been heard in Edna's room, he went down stairs, and, gently opening the kitchen door, bade Mrs. Ashland good-by, saying he was going over to town to see his mother, and asking if she wanted any errands done.</p> 
               <p>"I believe not, Nathan," she answered, after a moment's thought, and then added, "You must tell your mother to come over here some time when the warm weather comes."</p> 
               <p>"I thank you," he replied, "I will; but I presume she will hardly get as far as here, for she is no traveller, and seldom goes beyond the shadow of the old homestead."</p> 
               <p>Although Nathan evinced no disposition to converse with Richard, and avoided him as much as possible, the latter thought that while the same roof sheltered both they should at least speak; and therefore, after the boat had pushed off, he inquired pleasantly of Nathan whether he intended to remain in town long.</p> 
               <p>"As long as my business demands, sir questioner," was the rude and sullen reply.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>The young sailor merely cast upon him a look of scorn, which caused Nathan's eyes to fall, and his face to be suffused with shame; and Richard, resolving that Nathan should better merit his notice ere he attempted to enter into conversation with him again, devoted himself to the guidance of the sloop.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan reached the landing, he went into the little grocery, and, taking a book from his pocket, seated himself by the fire, and looked at the pages; but it was evident his mind was elsewhere, as the top of the book was turned towards him, which he did not discover until the grocer's boy entered, and jokingly asked him if he could read. Nathan quickly turned the volume, and then took a seat by the window, where he could have a view of the boat he had just left, and this position he retained until he saw the Swallow turn her prow for the other shore. After a few moments' conversation with the grocer, he went out.</p> 
               <p>When once more in the street, Nathan walked at a quick pace until beyond the thickly-settled part of the town; then, taking a narrow path that led through a thick grove of maple, birch, and chestnut trees, he slackened his steps, and sauntered slowly along, as if undecided whither to direct his course.</p> 
               <p>Within a few feet of the path he saw a low but wide-spread rock, and, as the warm rays of the afternoon sun were shining on it, he covered with his broad bandanna a portion of it upon which the moss had been gathering for ages, and seated himself there, as if for contemplation. As he looked around him, he could see the fleet limbs of the squirrel as he sprang from branch to branch, and among the decayed leaves<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5991-00000081"/> and low shrubbery he could hear the light footfall of the rabbits in their sportive gambols. The scene was so peaceful and lovely that it seemed as if even to the ill-disposed it would have brought pure and pleasant thoughts, and awakened gratitude to the Great Author of life and blessings,-to Him who gives to the giant oaks their strength, and who creates the animals for the benefit of man.</p> 
               <p>But Nathan's heart was too full of its wicked schemes to indulge in heavenly aspirations. As he reclined upon the rock, endeavoring to perfect his evil plans, he thought he heard among the rustling leaves a heavier tread than that of the quadrupeds that flitted past him; and, listening, he soon heard a low voice singing to a plaintive air: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"He comes not to me now, though lonely I sit</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">'Neath the bright shining sun of my own cabin door;</l> 
                        <l>But his sweet, loving words I'll never forget,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">E'en should he visit his Monieda no more."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>As the last words were pronounced, Nathan sprang to his feet, and called, affectionately, "Monieda!" An Indian girl stepped aside and bent her ear in the direction of the rock, and when her name was repeated by the same voice, she darted through the low blueberry-bushes, until she came to the rock where Nathan stood. But her look of delight changed instantly, and, as if fearful she might be too forgiving for his past neglect, she inquired, in a firm tone, why his seat in her mother's cabin had been so long empty.</p> 
               <p>"Will not the same answer do now, dear Monieda, that I have always given? for the same cause has kept<pb n=""/> me from you-I am poor. Has not Monieda lived in the forest long enough to know that the squirrel could not exist in winter if he did not provide for the future when nature directs?"</p> 
               <p>For a moment the girl was silent, and with a scrutinizing glance scanned the features of the young man; but, as there was no change in the hue of his cheek, or the expression of his face, her anxiety passed away, and her dark eye grew brighter, and her manner more confiding, as she allowed her hand to rest in the grasp of Nathan, who led her to the mossy rock, where both seated themselves.</p> 
               <p>"How is your mother to-day?" asked Nathan, looking kindly at her. "Is she better than when I was last at the cabin?"</p> 
               <p>"No," answered Monieda, mournfully; "and much I fear she never will be; for Kansko, the Indian doctor, was there yesterday, and when he consulted what he calls his charmed bag, he said the Great Spirit told him that many moons would pass away, and Wenoma would still lie on her mats, with limbs weary."</p> 
               <p>"And does the dark-eyed Monieda believe in such trash as the charms of the old medicine-man?" said Nathan, with a smile, as he looked into the face of the handsome though dark-skinned girl beside him.</p> 
               <p>"No," returned she, proudly; "but my mother does, and I do not like to wound her feelings by telling her I have no faith in what she holds so sacred."</p> 
               <p>"I honor you the more for that, dearest Monieda," said Nathan, thoughtfully, and drawing the warm blanket more closely around her shoulders, for the sun<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5991-00000082"/> had now well-nigh accomplished his day's journey, and was casting long shadows where they sat.</p> 
               <p>"I might have believed in this, and many other superstitions, as well as my mother, had I not been taught by the pale-faces to think differently," she continued.</p> 
               <p>"True, Monieda; but, thank Heaven, Mrs. Saul was faithful to her trust; and executed the plans of the noble chief, your father, although the Great Spirit saw fit to take him before that contract was completed."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she was kind, Nathan; but when my father bartered his lands on Quonanicut for my education, he left my mother penniless; and now poor old Wenoma, once the wife of a landed chief, must end her days in an almost roofless cabin, devoid of nearly every comfort."</p> 
               <p>"But can you not turn your education to a good account, and among the pale-faces earn that which will make your mother comfortable?"</p> 
               <p>"Would that I could, Nathan! But who would come to our miserable cabin to give me employment, when there are so many that live less remote from the wealthy of the town, who have good homes, where their employers can give directions how and what to do? Had the Great Spirit spared my benefactress, the case might have been otherwise; for she knew the sacrifice my father made for my education, and the misfortunes that befell him when he was bereft of his remaining acres by another sachem, of whose previous claim he knew not until too late to regain that which he had parted with."</p> 
               <p>"But can you not leave your cabin, and again dwell<pb n=""/> among the people of the town, Monieda?" said Nathan, who seemed to listen with interest to the story of her misfortunes.</p> 
               <p>"Is it Nathan Fossett who says that, or would he even hint to me to leave the side of my poor and helpless mother, now that she is old, and her strength has forsaken her?" said the girl, looking reproachfully into his face, and attempting to rise from his side.</p> 
               <p>"Stay, Monieda!" said Nathan, encircling her waist with his arm; "I was but in jest, for I know too well your devotion to your mother to think that you would leave her, even though the best of nurses should offer to take your place."</p> 
               <p>"True, Nathan, for who can spread the mat as smoothly, or cook the venison as tenderly, as a child? No, not even the love I bear you could force me away from the old weather-beaten cabin where dwells Wenoma, unless she accompanied me."</p> 
               <p>"Well, let it all pass now, Monieda, and tell me where you were going when I detained you."</p> 
               <p>"I was going up to the old century-oak to see if the quail-snares I laid there last evening had caught me any game; and a little beyond that, where the brush grows thicker, I have set a fox trap, and I left my mother asleep and came out to see what luck I had in trapping." And then she added, in a timid tone, "Were you going up to the cabin when I found you here?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Nathan, slowly; "but when I do get a few hours' leisure, to come over to town, I have so many places to go to that I scarcely know which to visit first; and so I had some thought of letting your cabin be the last, that I might remain the longer."</p>

               <p>"So many places!" repeated the girl, with emphasis, and looking at him steadily, with a sad expression. Then, after a brief pause, she added, "There lives at Newport but one Monieda."</p> 
               <p>"O, nonsense, girl! I came to Newport to see no other of your sex; but I have been speculating a little lately, and have met with good success, and I came over to attend to business; and, besides, I have some work for you to do in penmanship, which will be a great favor to a lady of my acquaintance. O, don't frown; for the lady is married, and has one child,-so you see she is no rival of yours." And Nathan drew from his pocket a scrap of paper, on which a few words were written by a female hand, and asked Monieda if she could imitate the chirography of the writer.</p> 
               <p>The young girl said nothing, but, taking from the linen pocket at her side a small piece of black chalk, scraped to a point, repeated underneath the lines the words that were written above; and so skilful was the imitation that only a close observer would detect that one hand did not execute both.</p> 
               <p>"Bravo!" shouted Nathan, in a tone an octave higher than his usual voice; "if you can do so well at the first attempt, with that blunt edge, what will you do with the quill's point, after a little practice?"</p> 
               <p>"But for whom am I to write this, Nathan?" said Monieda, "and why?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is getting too late to sit here longer now; and, as I have seen you, I will go back to the street and attend to some business I have to see to, and then I will come to your home this evening, and tell you all about it."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"That will do," said Monieda, pleasantly, as she arose to her feet. "It is, indeed, getting late, and if my mother should awaken she would fret not to see me there to prepare her supper; so I'll hasten to the traps." And, with a light bound, she was soon in the path. After passing down a little way, she turned off in the direction of the beach, and her light drapery was quickly lost among the tangled wood and projecting rocks.</p> 
               <p>Nathan gazed on the graceful figure of the Indian maiden until it disappeared, and for a while seemed lost in admiration. Then he murmured to himself, "No, no; it will never do to think of marrying her-she is too poor." After a little reflection, he added, "But 't is plain nature never intended me for a villain, for she put in some material that is too soft to carry me through a crime of deep dye. Well, well, let it pass; I have gone too far to recede now, so I will on to the end, and trust to luck to come out bright at last. But I must tell Monieda a plausible tale about this letter; for, if she suspected there was any fraud in the affair, well as she loves me, she would not write it, though she might not expose me." Seating himself again on the rock, he remained in a contemplative attitude, until the sun had ceased to shine on the tops of the tall trees.</p> 
               <p>Retracing his steps down the path, Nathan walked rapidly on until he came into a broad street in the centre of the town. As he approached the entrance to a narrow court, he looked up and down the thorough-fare to see if any one were near whose countenance was familiar to him; but, ascertaining that all who were<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5991-00000084"/> wending their way through the street, for business or pleasure, were unknown to him, he went down the court, and rapped at the door of a low gable-roofed house.</p> 
               <p>In a moment a noise was heard within as if some one were hastily clearing away articles and concealing them; then a corner of the long white window-curtain was lifted, and in an instant more the latch was raised by a tall, masculine woman, apparently about fifty years of age.</p> 
               <p>"Why, la! Nathan, was it you that knocked so loud?" she said. "Well, I declare, if you did n't scare me 'most to death!"</p> 
               <p>"And why were you so frightened, Mrs. Howden?" said Nathan. "I hope you don't do anything here that makes you afraid the selectmen might send a summons for you to change your abode for the large brick house, with so many small rooms in it, over the brook."</p> 
               <p>"O, no, not me; I am a poor widow-woman, that gets an honest living by-"</p> 
               <p>"Stealing!" interrupted Nathan, and then continued, "But where is George? I don't see much of him lately; he has n't got into limbo, has he?"</p> 
               <p>"I guess not," said that personage, creeping out from under the broad shelf of the old buffet that stood in the corner of the small square room, and closing the strong doors behind him. "The <emph>select</emph> man that could catch me, if I was n't in the mood for it, would need to have the fleetness of a deer, the eye of an eagle, and the wisdom of a Solomon; and, as there is no per-<pb n=""/> son living in Newport that combines all these qualities, you see I am safe."</p> 
               <p>"Then why did you hide in the buffet?" said Nathan, laughing, and drawing a chair near the fire.</p> 
               <p>"O, that was by way of variety, to show mother how supple I could be in case of alarm."</p> 
               <p>"Well, where is Ben Dollamore?"</p> 
               <p>"O, he is gone to sea-whaling, or on board of a merchantman-I don't know which, neither do I care; for his example did n't add much to the morals of the town, or his wealth to the inhabitants thereof."</p> 
               <p>"And how is business, George?"</p> 
               <p>"Business, business!" repeated the other, with a low guttural sound, which might be interpreted either as a laugh or a growl. "If things don't brighten up soon, I shall be off too; it has got so now that I have to dive pretty deep into my pocket to find a shilling."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, be an honest man, and go to work and earn an honest living, as I do," said Nathan, laughing, and the mother and son joining him in his show of mirth.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said George, as their merriment subsided, "that's cool-decidedly so. But what is your business over here, and how long are you going to stay?"</p> 
               <p>"I came over to see about selling twenty or thirty bushels of potatoes for the old man."</p> 
               <p>"Where does the old ferryman keep his potatoes?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, what would you give to know?"</p> 
               <p>"Half the profits, Nath."</p> 
               <p>"No, <emph>sir;</emph> not for the whole. I know my business too well for that. It would be getting in a little <emph>too</emph>
                  <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5991-00000085"/> 
                  <emph>deep</emph> to disturb those, for no one knows the spot where they are buried but the old farmer and I."</p> 
               <p>"Honest young man!" said George, emphatically, and then continued, "I guess I had better go out and drum up the boys, for I suppose we shall all meet out on the island at Jack Weaver's to-night."</p> 
               <p>"I can't be there, George; so don't say anything about me to them."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed! and what's in the wind now?"</p> 
               <p>"O, nothing; only I have a little private business of my own to attend to."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, of course. The idea has just found its way through my brain. I had forgotten for the moment that you have to spend a share of your time with old Wenoma's daughter, the haughty wood-nymph. She puts on all the airs of a queen."</p> 
               <p>"And is she not the daughter of a king, descended from a relative of the noble Philip?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, Nath, I care not who her ancestors were, I hate her-she is so proud and still. The other day, before Ben went away, he and I went over into Narraganset woods a hunting, and with our rifles we brought down a noble buck. As we had considerable game in our bags at the time,-wild-turkeys, rabbits, and one thing and another,-we skinned him and got him all ready for a roast or a fry, and wrapped him up and took him to old Wenoma's cabin. We thought they would be so pleased at the present; for everybody knows that the old squaw has nothing but what they raise in their little garden, and what game Monieda can entrap."</p> 
               <p>"Monieda can bring down a deer as quick as you or<pb n=""/> Ben either, and can handle the rifle quite as skilfully," said Nathan, evidently interested in the recital.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose she can; for I have seen her shoot arrows, and I know she makes nothing of pecking an apple at a hundred yards or so."</p> 
               <p>"Well, go on. Did they accept the deer?"</p> 
               <p>"They did, at first, and seemed very much pleased; and then-"</p> 
               <p>"Go on."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I began to joke a little about one thing and another; no harm in anything I said-only I told her that I did n't believe you cared a rush for her, and she might just as well transfer her love to me; and-O Lord, Nath! I never saw her eyes look so black before. In an instant the deer was out on the snow-drift at the side of the cabin, and Monieda pointed to the open door with such an air that I began to think Philip had <emph>riz,</emph> and transmigrated into her form, to evade his enemies."</p> 
               <p>"She served you right," said Nathan, laughing, and manifesting his approval of the Indian girl's spirit. "Before you go there again, learn to treat your superiors with respect."</p> 
               <p>"They may starve before I will go there again to make them a present. But come, mother, won't you give us some supper pretty soon? because Nathan and I want to go out and cruise around a while before he seeks this dark-eyed damsel of the woods."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, boys, I will get you a bite of something, in a minute, when I have done winding this swingle of flax round my distaff, and set away the basket of tow."</p> 
               <p>The young men drew their high-backed chairs a<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5991-00000086"/> little nearer together, and talked in a low tone about things the mother did not understand, or, for reasons of her own, did not choose to hear. Going to the buffet in the corner, she unbuttoned the doors, and took from the corner of the upper shelf a hard-wood mortar and pestle, with which she soon pounded to a powder the scorched barley she had browned over the fire, and it was not many minutes before a large coffeepot filled with the barley liquid was steaming over the walnut coals, that sent out a genial heat from the old stone fireplace.</p> 
               <p>"Nath, you sport a fine suit, and seem to have plenty of money now," said George. "What say you to spending to-morrow evening with the aristocracy of Newport?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I should like anything for adventure, you know; and perhaps some rich lady may fall in love with me."</p> 
               <p>"Not while I am near, Nath."</p> 
               <p>"Nonsense, boy! But I see no chance of coming that game."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I do. Old Ralph Taylor's daughter is going to give a birth-day party to-morrow evening, and I <emph>accidentally</emph> became acquainted with her cousin a few weeks since. He has not been in Newport long."</p> 
               <p>"That accounts for your knowing him."</p> 
               <p>"Just so," said George, with a laugh, and then continued, "You must lend me a pound or two, just to keep up appearances with, and to show your gratitude for my introducing you into such high company; because, you see, I always have to entertain this Walter Morcom at one of the first hotels, and that is rather expensive. Mother don't seem to fancy keeping house<pb n=""/> in such style; so it won't do to bring one of the quality here."</p> 
               <p>"I live according to my purse," said Mrs. Howden, going to the fire and turning over the fish that her son had caught the day before out by the bass rocks; and then she added, "Folks should n't be too proud for their means-it generally brings them to some bad end."</p> 
               <p>"Mother is thinking of an elevated position, with a rope's end attached," said George, smiling.</p> 
               <p>Nathan involuntarily shuddered slightly, but he took no further notice of the remark, and, handing George a pound-note, agreed to accompany him and his new acquaintance the next evening. They all sat down to a comfortable meal of barley-coffee, fried fish, Indian johnny-cake, and pumpkin-pie.</p> 
               <p>"I don't think I have paid too dear for my entertainment," said Nathan, half an hour afterwards, as he pushed back his chair from the table; "for your cooking is delicious, mother."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>Mother!</emph>" repeated the hostess, inquiringly; "pray, who do you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, you, of course. You would n't be ashamed to call me your son, would you?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no; but it took me kind of by surprise, as you never called me so before."</p> 
               <p>"Nor won't again, unless I get in a tight place."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Howden leaned her elbow on the table, and rested her chin in her hand, looking curiously at her guest, as much as to say, "I don't see how I am in any way concerned in your affairs."</p> 
               <p>Nathan guessed her thoughts, and explained by saying,</p> 
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5991-00000087"/> 
               <p>"When I come over here and stay a day or two at a time, I have to make some excuse that looks reasonable to the old folks, or they won't think <emph>I am a good boy;</emph> so I just tell them that my mother lives in Newport, and that I come over to see her. And to-day, when I came away, Mrs. Ashland told me to invite her over to see them. Now, if they should insist on it, any time, why-"</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, Nathan," interrupted the toothless crone, helping herself to the last slice of johnny-cake, and laughing in such a manner as to expose the absence of nature's dentistry, "it is as plain as the catechism that you will die a natural death-you are so good at getting out of a scrape."</p> 
               <p>"Well, if I or anybody else call you my mother at any time, don't manifest any surprise, either here or abroad."</p> 
               <p>"No; but I think I have heard you say that your mother was dead."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; she died ere I was old enough to speak her name." And then he looked into the fire, and mused, "Or it might have been different with me; for I have been told she possessed graces that might adorn an angel."</p> 
               <p>After a little more conversation, Nathan bade Mrs. Howden good-evening, and, taking George's arm, both walked slowly up the narrow court.</p>

               </epigraph> 
               <p>IT was in a little low-roofed cabin, standing in a desolate spot, that Monieda and her mother dwelt. The old chief's wife was worn and weary with the weight of years and cares. Death had been busy in her family. Ere her husband had wrapped his blanket around him, and laid down for the last time, one by one the gems of her household had departed for the spirit-land, until there was none left but Monieda, the last-born; and around this young branch it seemed that all the wealth of love which might have been divided, had her brothers and sisters remained to share it, was centred. Yes, the old chief doted on his child, and often did he tell Wenoma that Monieda must read the books of the pale-faces. The wife did<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5991-00000088"/> not care about the learning of the town's people; but she loved to gratify her husband and please her child; and she consented that he should give to Mrs. Saul a part of their lands, in payment for their daughter's education. The lady performed well her task; but, after all, it seemed to add little to the happiness of the girl or her mother; for Wenoma did not like to live in the thickly-settled portion of the town, where Monieda might have turned her learning to advantage, by teaching; and, although the girl was skilful with her needle, she could not seem to obtain sufficient to do; for in those early times most garments were wholly manufactured at home, from the raising of the flax and wool to the fitting of the form.</p> 
               <p>Wenoma was not confined to the mats that lay on the small, low-post bedstead, although she was feeble, and suffered much from illness. In summer, when the grass was green, she would cross her limbs on a soft mat, made from the husks of the Indian corn, and would sit in front of her cabin and watch her daughter's movements, as she bent low and plucked the weeds from the flower-beds and among the vegetables that grew in the garden; and sometimes, when she thought Monieda did not use sufficient skill, she would slowly rise from her seat, seek her daughter's side, and with her stiffened fingers point out what seemed to her to be a better way. The Indian girl loved her mother, as every daughter should, and she acquiesced in all her plans, although, at times, she thought she gained nothing by so doing; but she remembered the words of her father, when he took her hand for the last time,<pb n=""/> and bade her be kind to Wenoma, for her star would soon set.</p> 
               <p>And the dark-eyed maiden loved the forest. To her there was society in the form of the unbending oak, and his less-imposing companions of the woods; and, in the spring, the murmur of the stream and the carols of the birds were music to her ear. She loved to climb the high mountain statuary which God carved out of chaos by his word, and gladly would she have made the forest her home, if it could but have yielded her and her mother their support; but the time had now passed away forever when the Indian could subsist on his native hills, along the shores of the Narraganset, without the arts of the pale-faces.</p> 
               <p>On the morning of the day that we introduce Monieda to the reader, she softly crept out from the warm skins that covered her mother's aged form, and attired herself much after the fashion of the young women of the town, save that her blue camlet skirt was shorter, and a pair of dark leggins, which in her leisure hours she had embroidered with beads made from sea-shells, adorned her lower limbs.</p> 
               <p>After bending cautiously over Wenoma, to make sure that she was asleep, she lifted the cover of an Indian basket, and drew forth a large ball of strong twine, which she had twisted from hemp; then, wrapping a warm blanket about her, she quietly went out. When the echoes of her light tread could no longer have been heard in the cabin, had her mother been awake, she sped on almost with the fleetness of the fawn, as he clears the ground in his sportive gambols with his mates. She had not tripped onward far before she<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5991-00000089"/> came to a small opening, and, as her eyes took in the scene, her voice broke through the stillness, and uttered a shrill cry of joy; for the snares of strong cords which she had set the day previous now held captive sufficient game to grace their table, not only this day, but for several succeeding ones. Monieda was not long in unfastening the slip-nooses from around the victims, nor in replacing new ones where some had been broken in the struggles of the game to set themselves free.</p> 
               <p>When Monieda returned to the cabin, Wenoma had arisen from her bed, and a bright fire was blazing on the stone hearth, to welcome her. So light was the young girl's step, that the mother was not aware of her presence until she held before her, on a small bough which she had broken from the low limb of a walnut-tree, the bodies of several partridges, quails, and a large wild-turkey.</p> 
               <p>"May the Great Spirit keep you from harm!" said the aged Indian woman, reaching out her dark, thin arms towards her child, and dashing from her faded lashes the tear-drops that rendered her vision more obscure; and then she added, "Wenoma will not complain, for when the Great Father took Lawashka from her side, he left Monieda to share her blanket, and close her eyes when she had looked upon the sun for the last time."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't speak so, mother!" said Monieda, clasping her arms around the swarthy neck of the Indian woman, "for the oak shall wear her green, leafy clothing many times ere the form of Wenoma is<pb n=""/> stretched beside Lawashka under the old pine-tree on the hill."</p> 
               <p>"For your sake, Monieda, would that it might be so; for you are a tender plant, and when the old tree that has ever shaded you is cut down, much I fear that you may wither and die. You will miss the shade of the old tree, even if there is trouble in cherishing it."</p> 
               <p>Monieda bowed her head in her mother's lap, and for several minutes neither spoke; but the thoughts of each were busy.</p> 
               <p>One was living over long ago, when a dark, proud form clasped her to his breast, and welcomed her to his home; and more rapidly than electricity darts along the wire did Wenoma's mind course through many years,-from the time when her long hair wore the jetty tint of the raven's wing, to the present hour, when but a few shades separated it from the hue of the untrodden snow upon the mountain's top.</p> 
               <p>And where was the mind of Monieda? It dwelt upon a form more palpable,-one that lived, and moved, and breathed; one who, as the reader knows, was unworthy of her love. But she knew it not. In her mind he was all that the Great Original meant to embody when He placed the first of his species on the earth, and made him but a little lower than the angels. Many weeks had passed since she had seen him, or even heard from him, and there was a sadness about her heart that she strove to repress, for she feared her love was not returned; and then, in quick succession, there passed through her mind every word Nathan had spoken while sitting by her at the fireside of the cabin, or roaming through the forest. She recol-<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5991-00000090"/> lected, too, how tenderly he had looked upon her when her mother seemed sad, and spoke of the poverty of their home; but neither Monieda nor her mother said more on the subjects nearest their hearts, and soon the maiden arose, and went about preparing their morning's meal. When that was over, and she had made tidy their little square room and bed-room, Monieda gathered around her feet the small, pliable twigs of the willow, and, assisted by her mother, commenced to weave them into a basket, to be sold in the town.</p> 
               <p>As sunset approached, Monieda became tired of her quiet posture, and, Wenoma having laid down to rest, the daughter stole out to another place, where, on the preceding day, she had set a snare, hoping to entrap a fox, or some other animal of equal size. As she went along, singing an impromptu strain, she caught the sound of Nathan's voice. Of their interview the reader is already apprised. We therefore pass on to the time when she returned to the cabin, unburdened with any weight, for the wily fox had stepped cautiously around the fatal coil, and partaken of the food intended to be his last, and then, unharmed, had gone to join his companions, and, in his mute way, inform them of the dangers he had passed.</p> 
               <p>When Monieda reached her home, her mother was still sleeping, the fire was burning dimly, and at another time the old hut in its loneliness might have looked cheerless to her; but now her heart was too buoyant, for she had seen him she loved, his strong arm had encircled her waist with respectful tenderness, and his warm lips had pressed upon her brow a loving<pb n=""/> good-by till they should meet again. Closing the door, she doffed her heavy shoes, and in their stead drew on a pair of light moccasins which she had wrought, and with unusual care arrayed her person. The shells which the foam-crested waves had washed upon the beach, and which Monieda had delighted to collect, were freed from dust, and their delicate tints exposed to the best advantage on the shelf above the fireplace. The highly-valued books, too, the gifts of Nathan and other friends, were placed conspicuously on the little round stand in one corner, and the floor was newly sanded, after the custom of the pale-faces. When Monieda had arranged the house to suit her taste, she went to the old buffet in the corner, and took from the under shelf the wild-turkey she had captured. During the day Wenoma had cleaned it, and prepared it for roasting by pinioning its wings and limbs with wooden skewers, and fastening a cord to its neck. Monieda tied the cord to a hook that was nailed to the rough mantel, and, after placing a pan beneath to catch the greasy liquid as it dropped from the roasting fowl, she seated herself in the corner to baste its sides, and keep it turning while she waited for her lover.</p> 
               <p>Earth's dome was crowded thick with stars ere the maiden heard his footsteps among the dried and crisp leaves at the cabin door. She had told her mother that he was coming, and was going to bring some work for her to do. Wenoma seemed pleased, but yet there was an expression of distrust on her face, that the girl did not comprehend until the aged woman advised her to be wary, and not trust the fox too much. She<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5991-00000091"/> would have said more, had she realized how the image of Nathan filled every avenue of her daughter's heart.</p> 
               <p>Monieda did not wait for the young man to lift the latch, but as she heard him coming she hastily laid down the swab with which she was basting, and went to meet him. Nathan, for the time, seemed to forget all else but that he was where he was beloved, where no one knew of the dark side of his character, and where no one looked on him suspiciously. After the first greeting was over, he drew from beneath his surtout a small package, and handed it to Monieda, saying, pleasantly, "There is a present for you."</p> 
               <p>Monieda thanked him, and, unwrapping the gift, disclosed some books, which he knew that she would value, and fine-textured letter-paper, with other materials convenient for writing. The young girl was indeed grateful for the gifts, which were luxuries she could not afford to purchase, and with moistened eyes she told him so; but he said, with a smile, that she was a good girl, and perhaps some day she would be worth enough to indulge in greater luxuries than those.</p> 
               <p>Then, opening a large bundle, he displayed a gray sheep's wool blanket. "This," said Nathan, playfully, "is to keep <emph>mother</emph> warm, and to hang up to-night to keep the wind from our backs while we sit by the fire;" and he arose and stretched it across the room a few feet back from the place where he had been sitting. This was done not so much to shield them from the night-wind as to show the broad dimensions of the blanket; and it made Wenoma's eyes sparkle with pleasure as she viewed it, and thought how valuable it would be to her. Then he gave her a<pb n=""/> gayly-painted Dutch pipe, accompanied by a paper of tobacco.</p> 
               <p>The Indian was delighted, for the gifts were unexpected and welcome. Wenoma rendered herself agreeable to her guest, and when the turkey was cooked, and the supper ready, all drew around the smoking game, while the blaze from the large pine-knot in the corner threw out rays scarcely less brilliant than our modern gas, and all seemed happy in one another's society.</p> 
               <p>At length the meal was ended. Wenoma, according to her custom, sought her bed much earlier than her daughter, and, closing the low and rusty-hinged door of their little bed-room, she left Nathan and the young maiden alone.</p> 
               <p>Nathan seemed in an abstracted mood, and sat silent while Monieda cleared the table, and again arranged the room in order. As she approached him, and spoke his name, he started nervously, like one aroused from a revery; then, drawing her to his side, he smiled, and mentally contrasted her with the timid, retiring Edna, and the cheerful, half-defiant Lucy; with either of whom he would have been willing to risk his future happiness for the sake of money, though his fancy led him to prefer the noble girl beside him. At length he took a letter from his pocket; as he unfolded it a scrap of paper fell out. It contained a few lines of poetry, which Edna several weeks previous had composed. Nathan had picked it up from the floor, where it had accidentally fallen from her pocket while she was removing other articles. Edna missed the little paper, but it gave her no uneasiness, as there was no name<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5991-00000092"/> attached to the lines. Little did she know that Nathan had been watching, with vigilant eye, for an opportunity to obtain a specimen of her hand-writing; neither could she have imagined to what use he would put his knowledge.</p> 
               <p>Monieda extended her hand for the letter, but he withdrew it, saying he wished to explain its contents, and why he wanted it copied. It was evident, from the similarity of the writing, that he who penned the letter had been trying to imitate the billet; and in some degree he had been successful, but not sufficiently so but that it could be easily detected that one hand did not write both.</p> 
               <p>Monieda prepared herself to listen to his explanation, but she could not avoid noticing that he hesitated for words. He soon made all clear, however, by saying that it would offend the lady who employed him if she were to know that he had failed to imitate the writing of her friend who had been her amanuensis, but who was now gone to Virginia to remain for a year.</p> 
               <p>"You have nothing to fear from me," said the girl, kindly, "for I know none of your acquaintances." And then, as if a sudden thought flashed through her brain, she added, with a blush, "None except those two young men who were hunting with you the first time I saw you. And, if I did, I would not injure you, for I shall never forget your kindness to my mother and myself."</p> 
               <p>Nathan bowed, but made no comment on her remarks, being too much engaged with his own thoughts. After she had done speaking, he commenced: "For several years I have been acquainted with a lady whose<pb n=""/> husband is wealthy. He is an Englishman by birth. When he was quite young he crossed the ocean and journeyed through America. Here he became acquainted with a young girl who had very fine abilities, and good natural sense, but who was entirely destitute of education. He was attracted by her beauty, and, being of an impetuous disposition, and his own master in regard to wealth, he proposed marriage to her, and she accepted him. She could read, but was unable to write; which latter circumstance, being a woman of high spirit, she had concealed from him. About six months ago, he returned to England to transact business of importance, that would detain him for some length of time. During his absence she engaged an intimate friend to attend to her correspondence with her husband; but this friend has lately left, and, wishing to continue the deception, the other day she brought this verse of poetry to me, and asked me if I could imitate a lady's hand-writing. I tried, and my effort seemed to please her; and then she disclosed to me, in confidence, what I have told you, and dictated to me what she wished me to write. A few lines I can imitate very well, but I find I am not so successful when I attempt a whole letter; so I have written here what she desires to say concerning herself and her child, and now, if you will copy it as perfectly as I know you are capable of doing, you will be liberally rewarded; for she has paid me handsomely, and all she gave me shall be yours. Besides, it will be doing her a great favor, as she intends to take lessons in writing immediately, and will soon be able to hold her own correspondence, so that she will not be obliged to acknowledge<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5991-00000093"/> to her husband the humiliating fact that when he married her she could not write."</p> 
               <p>"I am sorry for her," said Monieda, plaintively, as she listened to Nathan's fictitious tale, "and I will do all. I can to oblige her and you." She was about to draw a small table towards the fire, but Nathan requested her to let it remain where it was, as he wished to spend the residue of the evening in talking on other subjects, saying he would leave the letter to be copied, and the slip of paper containing the verse, and call for them the next afternoon.</p> 
               <p>Monieda readily agreed to this, for she thought her hand might be too unsteady to guide the pen, and she was pleased also to devote the time to conversation; and as Nathan talked in a low, confiding tone of the past and future, in such a way as he knew would please her, she felt that after this visit she should be more lonely than ever. After he had told her where he had been, and related scenes he had witnessed since he last saw her, Monieda timidly inquired where and for whom he worked.</p> 
               <p>Nathan playfully pinched her cheek, saying, "O, you want to be wise, and then, if business keeps me too long away, you can hunt me as you do the squirrel."</p> 
               <p>"Never!" said the girl, with a flashing eye. "I hunt the squirrels around our cabin to supply our necessities; but be assured, if you do not love Monieda well enough to seek her at her home, she will never hunt for you."</p> 
               <p>"You do not love me as I thought you did," returned Nathan, his pleasant expression changing to one of dejection, "or you would not resent a pleasant<pb n=""/> word spoken but in jest, to see how you would answer it."</p> 
               <p>Monieda loved Nathan with all the intensity of her nature. She believed every kind expression of his face was the true index of his heart, and she answered, "I can use no deceit, Nathan; what I think, I speak. If need be, I could die for you; but Monieda was not the daughter of a dog, that crawled upon the ground and licked the hand that smote him. When you tell me that I would <emph>hunt you,</emph> I cannot forget that I am the daughter of Lawashka; and, though now I live alone with my mother, in a cabin where the wintry winds make music among the loose shingles on the roof, yet I am as proud as if I owned the broad lands that once were my father's."</p> 
               <p>Nathan felt the rebuke, and perceived the wide difference there was between her noble nature and his; but from the movements of the well-trained muscles of his face few could guess his thoughts, especially such as the inexperienced and confiding Monieda. So, when he again told her, in a low, earnest tone, as he had often declared before, how much he loved her, and how happy they should be when he had obtained a sufficient sum to purchase a small farm, and she should share its comforts as his wife; and asked her if she loved him well enough to trust in him, and wait in her present poor habitation till that period should arrive, her reply was, "Does the plant love the sun, and wait patiently through the dark night for its cheering rays on the morrow?"</p> 
               <p>"It does," said Nathan, the beauty of the imagery appearing forcibly before him; "and as the sun is true to the plant I will be to you. If business keep<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5991-00000094"/> me from you a long time, do not distrust me; for I will return again to your cabin, and repeat what I have said to-night,-that when I can call a few acres of land my own, you shall be my bride."</p> 
               <p>The night was far advanced when Nathan took his leave, promising to call the next afternoon for the letter. As he was about to go, he gave Monieda a glittering purse, its sides protruding with the valuable contents, saying, "The purse is a present from me, and the money payment for writing the letter."</p> 
               <p>At first she hesitated, and was unwilling to receive so large a compensation; but, as Nathan urged, and refused to accept the service unless she took the gift and its contents, she thought of the many comforts it would purchase for her mother, and, saying no more, shut her hand with a light grasp on the glittering bauble. When the creaking door of the cabin closed behind her lover, Monieda went back to her seat by the fire.</p>

               <p>WE cannot say that Nathan <emph>loved</emph> the Indian girl; and yet, when he was in her presence, there was an attraction about her that drew forth better impulses than he experienced when conversing with his companions of the other sex. He loved woman with an intensity that seemed strange in one so devoid of many of the better qualities of man. We cannot call him good, neither was he totally bad; but his character was a mixture of right and wrong, in which the latter predominated. Had Nathan been wealthy, and met with none but good associates, he might have been the champion of right, and Edna would have seen far less of woe. But, as it was, he yielded to his love of gold and lack of firmness in resisting evil, until the downward road became easy to travel, and he followed it without considering to what it might lead.</p> 
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5991-00000095"/> 
               <p>When Nathan was gone, Monieda did not seek her pillow by the side of her mother, but, after a few moments' reflection, replenished the decaying fire, and, drawing up a small writing-table,-the gift of her by whom she had been educated,-sat down to read the letter before she essayed to copy it. It was short, and seemed to breathe affection; and yet Monieda thought there was an avaricious, mysterious spirit about it which puzzled her. But, as the reader may like to know its contents, we give a few extracts.</p> 
               <q>
                  <p>"DEAR CHARLES: As soon as I heard that the Cleopatra had arrived, I hastened to Newport, expecting to get a letter from you, and with delight I can say I was not disappointed. I assure you the package of money did not come amiss; for my staying here has been much more expensive than we anticipated. I expected that my services would pay both Freddy's board and mine; but in this I was mistaken. So you see your gift came very opportune. I am as happy as I can ever expect to be when I am away from you, and Freddy seems very contented. But I am now left nearly penniless, as my host has taken from me the larger portion of what you sent. It seems very strange to me to be so dependent as I shall have to be in future, until I either see you or receive another package. Dear Charles, don't think me extravagant, for I would not call upon you if I could help it; but I knew you would not like to have me leave here until I hear from you, or you return."</p>
               </q> 
               <p>Monieda read on to the last line, which ended with the name of Lizzie, and then she leaned back<pb n=""/> and spread it out before her. As she looked at it and pondered over it, there seemed to be a something that made it appear different to her from what she imagined she should write to one she loved,-to one whom she could call by the fond name of husband. Why were there no names mentioned but Lizzie and Freddy? Had she no news or little piece of gossip to relate to the absent?</p> 
               <p>But then Monieda banished all doubt, for it was Nathan who had given her the letter and explained all. So she threw herself into an easy position, and, after practising the style of the penmanship, copied it word for word. As it lay folded before her, the counterpart of the original letter, ready for the young farmer when he should come on the morrow, her mother called to know why she had not slept.</p> 
               <p>Monieda, fearing her mother would be angry, answered, "I am alone, mother. The stars lit Nathan down the path. Since then I have been writing, and I stayed by the fire to look at my new books."</p> 
               <p>Wenoma seemed satisfied by the reply, and pleasantly told her daughter that she had better lay aside her books, and come and sleep a while, for she thought the morning would soon dawn.</p> 
               <p>"I will," said Monieda, "in a few moments." She replaced her writing apparatus in the table-drawer, and, after glancing at the pages of the new books that Nathan had brought her, quickly disrobed herself, and lay down to pleasant dreams beside her mother.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan left the cabin, he proceeded down the footpath towards the main street of the town. He could not determine whither to go. He did not like to<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5991-00000096"/> enter an inn at that hour, for, being alone and without baggage, the landlord might evince more curiosity than Nathan felt disposed to gratify; neither did he like to go to Mrs. Howden's, for it was very doubtful whether George would be in. So he walked about until his limbs began to grow chill, and he feared that he should be obliged to resort to the inn, after all. He buttoned his surtout closely about him, and, stopping under a large maple-tree whose naked branches over-arched the walk, thrust his hands into his pockets, and leaned against the base, as if to indulge in reflection. His hand grasped his pocket-book, and he could not but think that if the amount he now called his own had been honestly gained he would have enjoyed it more; for he was not happy. With possession had come the desire to obtain more, and he must sink himself still deeper in crime. There were moments when remorse gnawed at his heart, and made the lucre for which he had forfeited his self-respect appear as nothing; and then he consoled himself with the thought that, as no one shared his secrets, he need fear no betrayal. The longer he meditated, the more firmly he resolved that nothing should stand between him and his desire to obtain wealth.</p> 
               <p>Soon, here and there, a light was seen to glimmer from the low-roofed houses in the neighborhood, as the busy wives of the hardy sons of toil sprang from their beds to rake open and replenish the fire, that they might prepare the morning meal for their husbands ere they went to their labors in the field, or on the water; to fell trees in the fast-disappearing forest, or to arrange goods on the counters of their small and<pb n=""/> plainly-furnished shops. The cold breeze from the water made Nathan anxious to seek some spot where he could feel the genial heat of fire, and he walked on rapidly until he came to a large two-story building, over the porch of which could just be discerned, by the misty light of the early dawn, in large, round letters, "The Stranger's Home." With a quick step he approached the door, and gave a gentle rap to be admitted. In a moment the bright ray that reflected from the lamp in the bar-room over to the tree on the opposite side disappeared, and then an authoritative voice demanded who was there.</p> 
               <p>"A traveller," said Nathan, "who has walked a long way, and wishes to get a little rest before he crosses the ferry to the Narraganset side."</p> 
               <p>The host within lifted the heavy bar that secured his door and kept his house free from intruders, and bade the young man enter and warm himself by the bar-room fire. Nathan stepped quickly in, and threw himself at full length on the high-backed settle; his limbs were cold and weary, and his head was oppressed with a heavy pain. He felt miserable, and glanced upward to the long shelf over the bar, where stood a glistening row of decanters, and a group of transparent tumblers, with a wishful eye. The young man who stood behind the bar arranging his glasses, cakes, cheese, etc., for his morning customers, observed the look that Nathan gave towards the shelf, and inquired if he would have a warm brandy-sling.</p> 
               <p>Nathan did not immediately answer, for he was summing up the day's business, and considering whether be could afford to spend a few hours in forgetfulness;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC5991-00000097"/> but, soon becoming weary of his thoughts, he said, impatiently, "Yes, and make it so strong that it may put me to sleep, and make my sleep indeed 'death's counterfeit.'"</p> 
               <p>"I will," replied the bar-keeper; and he kept his word, for Nathan had scarcely drained the tumbler before his brain began to picture strange images on the wall, and he called for a room where he might sleep off the maddening fumes, and restore quiet to his nerves.</p> 
               <p>"We have but one room unoccupied," said the host.</p> 
               <p>"That <emph>one</emph> is enough for me," replied Nathan, drowsily; "and the sooner I start for it the less help I shall need to get there." Saying which, he arose and braced himself against the settle, and motioned for the bartender to show him the vacant room.</p> 
               <p>The young man looked at his employer as if waiting for an order from him before conducting Nathan to his room. The landlord stepped to the side of the farmer, and drew him back on the settle, and said, in a low tone, "Young man, the reason we hesitate about your occupying that room is, because there is a stranger in the next apartment who is very sick, and a great deal of the time he is out of his head, and takes on bitterly about his wife and child."</p> 
               <p>"Are they here with him?" asked Nathan, endeavoring to arouse his half-stupefied faculties.</p> 
               <p>"O, no, and I don't know as they are living, though I don't know but what they are, for we can't make out anything by him. When he is himself and calm, he is sullen, and says but little; but when he has his feverfits, he is noisy and cries aloud, and if you were in the<pb n=""/> next chamber to him there is no brandy in my house strong enough to bring on a sleep that he could not wake."</p> 
               <p>"And has he no one with him?"</p> 
               <p>"No one but a French servant, who cannot understand a word of English; but he is very devoted to his master, and takes excellent care of him, and sees to all his bills."</p> 
               <p>"How long has he been here?"</p> 
               <p>"Only a short time; he came over in the brig Cleopatra."</p> 
               <p>"I should n't think you would want to be annoyed with such a boarder; for I should suppose that he would trouble all the rest in such a manner that it would be a loss to you."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is natural enough for you to think so, young man; but you see I understand keeping tavern better than you do, probably. I did n't put him very near my most frequented lodging-rooms; and he seems to have plenty of money, and is no ways particular about the amount of his bills. Besides all that, I should n't like to turn a fellow-creature out of doors because he is sick, and rather troublesome." The landlord again arose, and inquired if Nathan still desired to go up to the room.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," returned the young farmer, rather sarcastically, "I should n't like to shun a <emph>fellow-creature</emph> because he is sick;" and then, in an under tone, he murmured, "especially if he has money."</p> 
               <p>The landlord did not understand the words of Nathan, or, if he did, he was wise enough to keep it to himself; and both passed out into the long hall, and<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5991-00000098"/> then up a narrow flight of back stairs to the small unoccupied chamber.</p> 
               <p>"Will you want breakfast when you come down?" asked the landlord, eying the fine suit which Nathan was making preparations to lay aside for a morning nap.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied the young man, "and let it be a good one, for you see I am able to pay for it." In his anxiety to convince his host that what he said was true, he drew forth his well-filled pocket-book, and tossed it upon the bed. Had it not been for the stultifying effect of the brandy, Nathan would not have been thus communicative; but he ran no risk by his imprudence, save that the landlord would bear it in remembrance when he made out his bill.</p> 
               <p>The host having bowed pleasantly, and left the room, Nathan tried to compose himself to sleep; but it seemed that the chill air of the chamber, and the cold surface of the domestic linen sheets, extracted the heat from his brain, and left space for calm thoughts; for it was long before sleep came over his senses, and left him a prey to dreams. His was not the peaceful slumber of those who do no wrong. His rife imagination pictured strange forms, and anon there passed before him the pale Edna, who seemed to be roaming the world friendless and alone, save that Freddy shared her sorrows and her destitution.</p> 
               <p>At length he was aroused by a confused talking in the next room. He raised his head and listened, to see if he could understand what was said, and soon discovered that the stranger and his valet were conversing in French. Nathan knew enough of the language to<pb n=""/> speak it in simple sentences, and to comprehend if directly addressed; but he could not understand much of a continuous conversation carried on rapidly and fluently. He lay down again and tried to arrange a plan for becoming acquainted with the old gentleman, for he thought such an acquaintance might prove an advantage to him. He judged by circumstances that this sick man must be a stranger in America; he seemed in trouble, and might want some information that his servant owing to his ignorance of the English tongue, might not be able to obtain, and he was too helpless to go abroad to make inquiries himself; and then, besides, more important than all to Nathan, the landlord had said that he was <emph>rich.</emph> After weighing all these facts in his mind, Nathan determined that he would see the stranger and talk with him; but to bring it about seemed a difficulty almost insurmountable, for he led so secluded a life, and no one but the landlord had been admitted to his room. After thinking and being unable to decide upon a plan that seemed feasible, he endeavored to dismiss the subject, and went down stairs.</p> 
               <p>When the inn-keeper left Nathan's chamber, he went directly to his spacious kitchen, where his good wife was busy arranging the breakfast for her household and guests. "Lydia," said the landlord to his wife, "tell Levi to go out and kill a couple of chickens, and let Dorcas pick them, and have them done up in nice shape; for we have got one of the quality here, and he will want breakfast by and by."</p> 
               <p>"Where did he come from?" interrogated the wife,<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5991-00000099"/> without looking up from the board on which she was patting out a johnny-cake.</p> 
               <p>"O, that is more than I know, for I an't so inquisitive as you are; but, wherever he came from, he has got plenty of money to pay his bills with."</p> 
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> found that out," retorted the wife, "if you have n't any curiosity. If you'd thought he was a poor man, I wonder if you'd have ordered chickens."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, never mind, Lydia; you get up his breakfast in good style, and you shall have half he pays me." This piece of information seemed to end the war of words, and the hostess passed the order for the slaughter and dressing of the chickens.</p> 
               <p>As Nathan went below he was invited into a small side-room, where a comfortable fire was blazing, and soon the landlady's only servant, Dorcas, entered with a tray bearing a variety that might have pleased the most fastidious; but Nathan did not relish the dainties spread before him, for his mind was still engaged with the thoughts that had engrossed his attention in the chamber, and which he could not banish.</p> 
               <p>As Dorcas, who had been passing in and out of the small sitting-room waiting upon him, stopped before the fire to replace a fallen brand, his mind seemed to grasp a new idea, and, turning to the girl, he said, carelessly, "Are you any acquainted with the old gentleman's servant, up stairs?"</p> 
               <p>"No, sir," answered the girl, rather confusedly; "how could I be acquainted with him, when he can't speak a word of civil talk? One would think he was right from the tower of Babel!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, you have seen him, at any rate," said the<pb n=""/> young man, with a scrutinizing glance and a pleasant smile.</p> 
               <p>Dorcas turned away her head to hide her blushes, but Nathan's quick eye read all in an instant. The handsome face and pleasing address of the valet had struck upon a vibratory chord in the heart of the rosy-cheeked girl beside him. Thinking it best not to lose the advantage he had gained, Nathan continued,</p> 
               <p>"As I was coming down stairs I met him, and I think he is very handsome, and that he is good his devotion to his master proves. Now, Miss Dorcas,-I think that is what I heard them call your name,-I should like to see him a few moments, and you would oblige me very much if you would step up to their door and say to-"</p> 
               <p>"Jacques is his name," said the girl.</p> 
               <p>"Say to Jacques that there is a stranger down here who wishes to speak with him."</p> 
               <p>"O, I dare not," said Dorcas. "Why, what would he think of me?"</p> 
               <p>"Think of you? Why, nothing, only that you are a pretty girl come to do an errand."</p> 
               <p>"Well, but-"</p> 
               <p>"O, never mind the buts; only do as I request, and you shall be rewarded."</p> 
               <p>And he took from his pocket a bright gold coin, and tossed it into her lap as she sat in a stooping posture near the fire.</p> 
               <p>Dorcas raised herself to her feet, and, accepting the bribe, returned a gratified "I thank you," and hastened away in the direction of the stairs. She did not stop to think what she should say until her hand<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5991-00000100"/> was on the latch of the stranger's door. But just at that moment Jacques came out of the room, and she addressed him with</p> 
               <p>"There is a young man below who wishes to speak with you," forgetting for the moment that he could not understand English.</p> 
               <p>The valet smiled, and shook his head, as if to say "I know not what you want of me, or what you are saying."</p> 
               <p>This aroused the young girl's memory, and, with a shy glance into his face, she pointed to the small room below, and then led the way to where she wished him to follow, at the same time wondering how the young man was going to communicate with the valet.</p> 
               <p>As Nathan heard them approaching, he arose and met them at the door; and, after briefly complimenting the girl upon her dexterity in doing errands, invited the valet in French to enter, and take a seat by the fire.</p> 
               <p>When Dorcas heard Nathan address Jacques in French, she stood in amazement, looking first at one and then at the other, nor did she change her attitude until Nathan closed the door. Then, thinking she had been dismissed rather unceremoniously, she turned on her heel and went to the kitchen, to relate to her mistress all that had transpired, with her own embellishments.</p> 
               <p>Jacques was delighted to meet with an American who had even a limited knowledge of his native tongue; for, although there were persons in Newport who could speak the French language, there was no one at the inn, and since his master had been confined<pb n=""/> to his room by illness the servant had been troubled to make the inmates understand his and the stranger's wants.</p> 
               <p>"Did you send for me?" said Jacques, after the first salutations were over.</p> 
               <p>"Well, yes, I did," replied Nathan, carelessly. "The landlord said there was a Frenchman in the house, and I thought, if you had a little leisure, I should like to talk with you, to see if I can recall my mother's tongue."</p> 
               <p>"Then your mother was a Frenchwoman?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Nathan, looking around cautiously, as if he feared some one might be listening. "Is your master French?"</p> 
               <p>"No; but he speaks French very fluently, and he hired me because he could talk with me, and feel sure that I could not gossip with all I meet."</p> 
               <p>"Then I suppose your master don't like to become acquainted with strangers?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, he has no objection to becoming acquainted; but, being no great talker himself, much talk in another don't please him. But he is a good man, and everybody that does know him likes him, he is so generous."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I presume he can afford to be; the landlord tells me he pays liberally, and has the appearance of being rich."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, he is rich," answered the valet.</p> 
               <p>And then, fearing he had said too much, he glanced cautiously around, lest he might have been overheard speaking so freely.</p> 
               <p>Both remained silent for a few moments, and then Nathan drew his chair nearer the one where Jacques<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5991-00000101"/> sat, and, in a confidential tone, asked him if his master were not very sick, and if there were not something on his mind that at times seemed to worry him very much.</p> 
               <p>The Frenchman made no reply, but started to leave the room.</p> 
               <p>Nathan rose also, and prevented him from going by saying,</p> 
               <p>"Please stop, Jacques, and learn my motive for asking you those questions before you try to shun me. Rest assured I should not inquire into your business, or your master's, if I did not think I could be of service."</p> 
               <p>Jacques gave a scrutinizing look at Nathan before resuming his seat; but he could discern nothing but a pleasant smile and benevolent expression; and, remarking that he must not be absent from his room long, as his master might waken and require his attendance, he returned to the fire.</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish to be too inquisitive," said Nathan; "but I should like to know how long you have been in Mr. Sydenham's employ, and what causes his unhappy state of mind."</p> 
               <p>"As for the first question," answered Jacques, "I will tell you with pleasure. But the last I have nothing to do with-my master keeps his own counsels."</p> 
               <p>"Not always," said Nathan; "for he sometimes falls into broken slumbers, and then discloses what he would not like to have every one hear."</p> 
               <p>"And why not?" replied the valet. "There is no guilt upon his soul, and it is no crime to be unfortunate. He speaks of nothing but his misfortunes and a-"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Lost wife and child," interrupted Nathan.</p> 
               <p>Jacques expressed his astonishment that the young man should know this; for he was certain that he had never told any one what was the subject of his employer's ravings, and he had never heard him mention his troubles to another. He also knew that when Mr. Sydenham was haunted by troubled dreams, or suffered severe pain, he alone was his watcher.</p> 
               <p>"And how does it happen that you are so much in his confidence?" inquired Nathan, without explaining how he had ascertained this fact.</p> 
               <p>"While sojourning in France, he hired me by the recommendation of one who had known me from my birth, and spoke in praise of my faithfulness."</p> 
               <p>After a little more conversation, Nathan succeeded in persuading the valet to introduce him to his master, if his health should allow when he awoke, and if he consented to an interview. If any one had asked the young farmer why he wished to see Mr. Sydenham, and he had answered truthfully, he could have given no reason save that his curiosity had been awakened by what the landlord had said, and he was in hopes, by some plot, to transfer a portion of the traveller's money to himself. Nathan's perceptions were uncommonly well developed; and, being a keen observer of men and circumstances, and a passionate lover of money, he was ready to dare much, even if the prospects augured that he could accomplish but little. Therefore, after Jacques had left the room, Nathan placed his feet on the brass fender before the fire, and, as he watched the fantastic shapes of the blaze, ruminated until he grew impatient, and began to wonder whether the<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC5991-00000102"/> valet would deliver the message he had sent to his master, or whether, if he had delivered it, Mr. Sydenham had concluded to take any notice of the request. He was on the point of rising to go and settle his bill, and then rejoin his companions, when a knock at the door brought him to his feet, and he was invited by Jacques to go up to his master's room.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan was ushered into Mr. Sydenham's chamber, the invalid was half reclining in an old-fashioned easy-chair, which was leaned back against the wall of the room; and, as the young man advanced to a vacant chair by his side, he felt embarrassed to find himself there with no particular business. When Mr. Sydenham inquired why he was indebted to him for this call, he stammered forth an apology for the intrusion, and said that he had understood that he was out of health, and a stranger in the country, and he had called to see if he could be of any service to him.</p> 
               <p>"And is that your only motive for calling?" said Mr. Sydenham, with a piercing look.</p> 
               <p>Nathan's eyelids fell, but only for a moment; then, regaining his confidence, he returned a pleasant look to the inquisitive glance, and said,</p> 
               <p>"If you will dismiss your servant, I should like to talk with you about that which I think will be interesting."</p> 
               <p>"You have nothing to fear," said Mr. Sydenham; "for Jacques cannot understand English; and, if he could, he is a faithful servant-I had almost said friend."</p> 
               <p>"I have understood," said Nathan, eying the features of the old gentleman sharply (for he discovered<pb n=""/> a striking resemblance between his and the features of one with whom he was better acquainted), "that at some period of your life you have lost friends either by death or some other cause; and that if they are living you would like to hear of them, and if dead you still would wish to know the worst."</p> 
               <p>"What mean you, young man, by this language?" demanded Mr. Sydenham, raising his head from the pillows in his chair. "Surely you can tell me nothing now that will benefit me, for during twenty years I have pursued a phantom. My search has been vain; and now all that remains for me is to drag out a few more years in roaming the earth, and then to seek that home where the weary are at rest."</p> 
               <p>"What I have to say," replied Nathan, "is for your ears alone; and I shall not proceed unless your valet leaves the room."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sydenham directed Jacques to go, and in a moment he and Nathan were alone.</p>

               <p>AFTER the valet had left, each of the inmates of the invalid's chamber sat silent, as if he were waiting for the other to speak; but at length Mr. Sydenham broke the silence by remarking, "If you have anything to say, young man, you can speak now; there is no one present but ourselves."</p> 
               <p>Nathan felt awkward and confused, and all his usual tact for the moment forsook him; but, presently rallying, he observed that he had not much to impart,-indeed, what he had called to tell him might not prove true.</p> 
               <p>"I pray, young man, if you have anything to communicate," said the stranger, while his cheek blanched, and his once muscular frame trembled, "tell me, in Heaven's name tell me, for I have been too long the prey of doubts and fears."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>While the old man was speaking Nathan watched closely every expression of his face, and the more minute his scrutiny, the more convinced was he that he knew his son; and yet he did not wish to convey this information, unless he could gain some money by doing so. At length, putting on a resolute air, he said, deliberately, "I have understood that you lost a wife and child; but I freely confess I know not how. I cannot fathom your thoughts concerning their fate; but, if your child was a boy, and if you have a son still living, I think I know him."</p> 
               <p>"Know him-know him!" exclaimed the old man; "would to God you did!" And he buried his face in his hands, until he gained sufficient composure to inquire whether the person Nathan alluded to bore his name.</p> 
               <p>"No," replied Nathan, "he does not. I have been told that he is called after a fisherman's family, who rescued him from death, and with whom he resided when very young, until he left them to seek his parents and friends."</p> 
               <p>A loud groan from the invalid caused Nathan to start from his seat; and when he saw his delirious expression, and the pallor of his features, he was fearful that he might not survive the sudden shock. As he was about to call the valet, the old man recovered enough to wave his hand for Nathan to be seated, and when he grew calmer said, "You have told me that he was called after a fisherman's family, but you have not mentioned the name he bears."</p> 
               <p>"Richard Conworth," said Nathan, fixing his gaze on the traveller's face.</p> 
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5991-00000104"/> 
               <p>"It is indeed he!" said Mr. Sydenham; then, after a brief pause, he added, "Young man, if what you say prove true, and if you will restore to me my lost son, I know not whether you need gold, but, if you do, my purse shall be at your command; and not I alone will reward you, but God, who, in making you the instrument of uniting the only surviving members of a once happy family, will ever bless you."</p> 
               <p>"I am poor," answered Nathan, meekly; "and to bring him to you will be attended with considerable expense, as he does not live about here. The last time I heard from him, which was some two months since, he was in New York; but, if he has left that place, I should probably be able to obtain trace of him through friends I have there."</p> 
               <p>"I can but believe you," said the invalid; "for within a few years past I have seen the fisherman and his wife, and they told me the name he went by, and how miraculously, through their means, he was preserved from death; but I will not detain you to hear the particulars, as I am too impatient to see my child." He then requested Nathan to call Jacques, that he might reach him some money from his trunk.</p> 
               <p>Nathan bowed with humility, and, gently stepping to the door, did as he was desired; then, returning to the side of Mr. Sydenham, he said, "If I were not poor, I would not accept of the means to defray my expenses; but I have a widowed mother to support by my labor, and when she is made comfortable I have but little left."</p> 
               <p>"What is your name, young man, and where is your home?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Henry Jeffers," said Nathan, abstractedly; "and I was born in France."</p> 
               <p>"Which accounts for your speaking the French language," observed Mr. Sydenham.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," replied Nathan, gazing into the fire, and listening to the tread of the servant as he ascended the stairs.</p> 
               <p>"And where do you live now, Mr. Jeffers?"</p> 
               <p>"Jeffers-Jeffers," repreated Nathan to himself, as if the name sounded strangely to him; and then, suddenly recollecting that he had inadvertently given the traveller his real name, he felt embarrassed; he dared not attempt to give another then, for fear of exciting suspicion. But Mr. Sydenham did not notice his confusion; for at that moment Jacques entered, and he ordered him to hand him a small leathern bag from the trunk at the foot of his bed, and when he again asked Nathan where he resided he answered that he had been living in New York, and his mother was still there; but he was on his way to Providence, where he had had promise of work.</p> 
               <p>As he talked, his fears about having made known his real name to the stranger began to subside; there was no one in America who knew him by any other name than Nathan Fossett, and it was far from his intention to mention that name to Mr. Sydenham.</p> 
               <p>"Take this, young man," said the traveller, handing him a roll of bank-notes; "pay your expenses, and what remains keep for future use."</p> 
               <p>Nathan hesitated, as if reluctant to receive so large an amount; but, as the old man urged him, saying that he should consider himself well repaid if he would<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5991-00000105"/> but restore to him his son, Nathan slowly extended his hand for the bills, and, as he transferred them to his pocket, the delight that he felt at the success of his scheme could not be detected upon his placid face.</p> 
               <p>"How long will it be," said Mr. Sydenham, anxiously, "before you will return with him whom I am more desirous to see than all the world beside?"</p> 
               <p>"Just as soon as the wind and waves will waft me there and bear me back, after I learn the whereabouts of him I seek."</p> 
               <p>"God grant your delay may not be long!" As, with tears in his sunken eyes, Mr. Sydenham spoke of the years of wanderings and the suspense he had endured, and as Nathan heard of the loneliness and sorrow of his life, the promptings of his better nature made him half resolve that he would do as he had promised, and bring Richard to his side; for he could not doubt that Mr. Sydenham was his father, so perfect was the resemblance between the two.</p> 
               <p>After a little more conversation, in which Nathan, by his pleasant and sincere manner, increased the esteem which the invalid felt for him, he took his leave, kindly expressing a wish that when he returned he should find him restored to health.</p> 
               <p>As Nathan passed down the back stairway, he met Dorcas. "Stop a moment, Dorcas," said he, "and take this to the landlord, for I am in too much haste to go to the bar-room now;" and he took some coin from his pocket, and gave it to her.</p> 
               <p>"Why, bless me!" said the girl, "this will be too much to pay for the little bit you ate for your breakfast."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Well, you can keep what remains, my pretty girl, to buy something to remember me by when you and Jacques go to housekeeping."</p> 
               <p>Dorcas blushed, and answered, with a smile, that she should never marry a man that could n't talk the king's English.</p> 
               <p>Nathan made no further remark, but went out of the hall door into the back yard, and was soon in the street. He walked with a rapid pace until he had passed through several streets, and then he looked about for some place of safety where he could seat himself and count the sum Mr. Sydenham had given. That he had been generous he knew from the bulk of the roll; but Nathan was desirous to know the exact amount of his morning's work. In the back part of the town he discovered on a slightly elevated piece of land a small cabin or cottage, which gave evidence that it was unoccupied. He lifted the latch of the unfastened door, and went in; then he walked leisurely through the small rooms, and explored the conveniences of the building.</p> 
               <p>"This has been a snug little home for some one," he mused, "and would not afford a bad shelter now to some honest, industrious family. I wonder how much rent the landlord asks for it. If he is not too hard, perhaps I might hire it; and it may be that when I have discovered how much I am worth, I shall conclude to buy it." Leaning over into the kitchen fireplace, he rolled away from the ash-hole a large stone, and appropriated it for a seat. Divesting his pockets and pocket-book of all their contents, he found himself the owner of a hundred pounds. As Nathan<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5991-00000106"/> refolded the notes, the pleasure he felt in the possession of so much money seemed for a time to keep back more unpleasant thoughts; but after they were returned to his pockets he could but think of the feeble old man that he had just left buoyed by hopes which he had raised, and which in his heart he intended he should never realize. But soon his brow darkened, and his feelings of pity and benevolence were succeeded by those of hate and revenge, and he muttered to himself, "<emph>I</emph> do Richard Conworth a favor, and place him where it is evident a fortune would be at his command? Never! Fool that I am, to harbor one kind thought towards him! And does he intend to win the fair Lucy? Yes, it is plain he does; but, if effort of mine can prevent it, he never shall. Not that I should die of love if Lucy married another than me; but I would like to crush his proud spirit, and teach him that he cannot wed where he pleases, and where I cannot be successful."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, young man, you remind me of a story my mother used to tell me, when I was a little boy, about a poor soul that sat on a cold stone all alone with--"</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning, sir," interrupted Nathan, rising hastily, and pushing the stone back into the fireplace.</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning," repeated the intruder, extending his hand to Nathan, who shook it cordially, and perceived by the familiarity of the stranger's manner that he was owner of the premises.</p> 
               <p>"This is rather a pleasant little place," said Nathan, after they had exchanged salutations.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said the man, who was clad in a suit of<pb n=""/> homespun sheep's gray, and who seemed pleased at the compliment bestowed on his property. "I used to live here myself, a few years ago. I gin considerable money for this place, and thought Patience and I would always ha' lived here; but after I got a chance to go in the packet, why, she never seemed very contented here. She said it was too fur back; so I let it, and moved down nearer the water; but I have never got much good on't. Folks break up and destroy the fence around the garden, and smoke up the walls inside, so that it is getting to be nothing but a rack now to what it used to be."</p> 
               <p>"I called to look at it this morning," said Nathan; "and, as it suits me, I will hire it for a year, if we can agree about terms, and at the end of that time we can make a new bargain."</p> 
               <p>"Is it for yourself you want it?" said the Yankee, a smile lighting up his face at the prospect of letting his little homestead to one wearing such fine cloth.</p> 
               <p>"What rent do you ask for it?" inquired the young man, apparently not noticing the last remark of the proprietor.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I guess about five pounds a year. You see there is a nice snug garden, where a body can raise lots of potatoes, and all kinds of sass, if they're a mind to."</p> 
               <p>"Here, stranger," said Nathan, "I always have a quick way of doing business. So sit down on the stone where you found me, and draw up a contract,-and here is your money;" and the young farmer took out a roll of notes to meet the demand.</p> 
               <p>The tall man in homespun stood in mute surprise<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5991-00000107"/> for a moment, as he had not expected the stranger to accede so readily to his terms; but the desire to render his little house profitable soon brought him to his senses, and he answered, "I have nothing to write with."</p> 
               <p>"I have," said Nathan, producing from his pocket a small bottle of ink, which he had placed there with the intention of giving to Monieda, but had forgotten it; then taking out a quill tooth-pick, he whittled it to a point, and tore a blank leaf from the memorandum in his pocket-book, and passed each article to the owner of the house.</p> 
               <p>"What name?" said the stranger, looking into his face.</p> 
               <p>"O, it is of no consequence about a name," answered Nathan; "you can just make it out to the bearer of the billet, and whoever applies and produces that writing will be entitled to the house; and you have your pay in advance, so you see you run no risk."</p> 
               <p>"O, I know I don't run no resk as to money, but-but how do I know but that I am dealing with the-the-" And the man hesitated, and looked down towards Nathan's neatly-shaped shoe, with its shining buckles, as if there were strange thoughts in his brain. The young man read them by the expression of his face, and, bursting into a loud laugh, said, pleasantly,</p> 
               <p>"I have thought of being married, but am not quite ready yet; and if any of my acquaintance should find out that I had hired a house, they would make such sport of my haste, that it would n't be very pleasant for me, especially if anything should happen that I should n't get married at all."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O, that is it, hey?" said the landlord, spreading the paper on his knee, and commencing to write, as if ashamed of his past thoughts; and then he added, "I am no great hand at telling things, so you would n't ha' run much resk, if you had told me your name."</p> 
               <p>While Nathan was waiting for the contract, he walked to the window, and, looking towards the thickly-settled part of the town, counted and recounted the low spires of the few scattered churches, and in the distance numbered the slender masts of the different-sized vessels, as they rocked upon the water along the shore and wharves. He was soon put in possession of the paper that made the bearer owner of the estate for one year; and, bidding the stranger good-morning, he took his way towards Mrs. Howden's, beside whose fire he chatted with the mother and son, and heard George relate narrow escapes from being detected in roguery.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, Nathan rose from his seat, where he had been indulging in a pipe, saying to his companions that he had a call to make, and would be back in season to spend the evening with George, either among the quality at Ralph Taylor's, or a few grades lower at Jack Weaver's, on the island.</p> 
               <p>"Well," said George, "hurry back and we can go to both, for I don't care about staying a great while among the quality. What time I do stay, I should like to have my chair pretty near the door, so that, in case any one should be present who takes particular interest in the morals of Newport, I can bolt without the ceremony of taking a formal leave; for I never was so fond of high life as to wish to be in select-"<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5991-00000108"/> "Men's company," said Nathan, laughing and buttoning his surtout.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Howden looked up from her distaff, and remarked to Nathan that her boy always had a great dread of sheriffs; but she did n't know why he should, for none of his ancestors had suffered death at their hands.</p> 
               <p>Nathan felt a disagreeable sensation as she spoke; but, subduing his feelings, he bowed with an assumed cheerfulness, and went out. Retracing the narrow forest path he had trod the previous day, he walked with quickened steps towards the cabin of Wenoma. His full pocket-book did not make him happy as he hurried on; so he tried to shut out the past from his reflections, and let his vivid imagination depict a pleasant future.</p> 
               <p>But a short time elapsed before he saw the dark smoke curl upward from the chimney of the lone cabin among the large trunks and naked branches of the trees. Approaching the comfortless dwelling, his quick eye detected the form of Monieda at the window watching for his return. As their eyes met, and she hastily left the window to meet him at the door, Nathan smiled, and exclaimed, half aloud, "I have seen the time when I thought that, if death called me, I should leave no one to shed a tear for me, or regret my departure; but I cannot think so now, for Monieda has said that she would freely give her life to save mine, and I believe her, for she is ever truthful. And why should she not love me? for I have never injured her."</p> 
               <p>Here the young man's soliloquy was abruptly cut<pb n=""/> short by the cabin door being thrown back, and Monieda, the belle of the forest, standing before him.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad you have come," she said, as he reached her side; "it was getting so late, I was afraid that something might have happened to you."</p> 
               <p>"Were you afraid that I had been attacked by a bear?" said Nathan, sportively.</p> 
               <p>"No, Nathan; for since the red men have left the lands of their fathers, the bear and the moose no longer stay. What the pale-faces' rifles have spared have fled to the far off mountains and the rugged forest along the Connecticut. Neither the red man nor those animals which the Great Spirit gave him for food can harm you now; but there are bad men among your own people, who it were better should not cross your path."</p> 
               <p>"I always go prepared to meet them," said the young man, putting his hand in his bosom, and drawing out from beneath his waistcoat a new dagger from its leathern sheath.</p> 
               <p>Monieda playfully snatched the bright weapon, and, with a quick movement, sent it far ahead, where the sharp point struck deep into the base of a gnarled oak, and quivered there until it was withdrawn by the hand that sped it. With one bound Nathan was at her side, and, grasping her wrist, attempted to take it from her; but she dexterously passed it to the other hand, and what she lacked in muscular strength she made up in skill in her playful effort to retain it. But at length her strength yielded, and the young man seized the weapon. At that moment his foot slipped from the<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5991-00000109"/> mossy rock beneath the tree, and the dagger's point pierced the side of Monieda, who, with a heart-rending shriek, sank upon the ground. With a loud groan, Nathan fell by her side, and from the cabin rushed Wenoma, the energy of her youth brought back by despair.</p>

               <p>BREAKFAST was scarcely over at the ferry-house when Prue returned, leading Sammy by the hand. There was no one in the kitchen but members of the family; so the faithful old nurse, with a homelike feeling, drew near the table, and inquired if she could give her boy some breakfast, saying that when she went home Cudjoe had not risen, and she thought it too long to wait to prepare his morning meal."</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly, aunty," said Lucy, going to the fireplace and filling from the porridge-kettle a shining porringer to the brim, and placing it on the table beside Freddy. Sammy turned up his expressive black eyes into the face of the other little favorite, who sat in the high chair; and then, climbing into the one Lucy had just left, tried to make himself of equal height. Freddy watched him for a moment, and then whispered in his ear, "You take my chair, 'cause I done, and want you to hurry and come up stairs and see Edna, 'cause she<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5991-00000110"/> and I going to die; then, when you come here, there be no Freddy nor no Edna. Won't you be sorry?"</p> 
               <p>"Drefful," said Sammy, mournfully, and lifting the corner of his short check-apron to his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"You must n't cry, Sammy," said Freddy; "I an't a going to cry, for that makes Edna feel bad."</p> 
               <p>"Lord a massa, do hear the children talk!" said Prue, trying to smile, though she found it difficult to accomplish the effort without repeating Sammy's manuvre with the apron. Then, going to the table, she placed her boy in the high chair, and, taking Freddy on her knee, endeavored to divert them by saying that the warm weather was soon coming, and they should go down to the beach with her and pick up shells, and old Cudjoe should take them with him down to Narrow River fishing,-and that when they got a little bigger they should go over to Newport in a boat, some Sunday, and go to the grand meeting-house to hear that big organ that came over from England. As Prue proceeded with her narrative, the children forgot their grief in the pleasant prospect she portrayed. Happy faculty of childhood, so readily to cast aside its sorrows, and illumine its pathway by the sunshine of hope, and the presage of a radiant future!</p> 
               <p>When the meal was ended, Freddy and his sable companion decked themselves in such habiliments as they could find about the room, and, trying to fancy themselves soldiers, strutted back and forth in great glee. Prue watched them with all a mother's pride, for a few moments, and then quietly stole to the room of the invalid. With a noiseless step she approached the bed where Edna lay. Her face was turned towards<pb n=""/> the water, and looked pale and sad; but, as her nurse leaned over her, she met her kind look with a faint smile, and told her, in a low voice, not to leave her work to remain with her, for she needed nothing.</p> 
               <p>"I don't feel like working, Miss Edna, when you an't round; everything seems so lonesome like, and every minute I keep looking towards the door to see if you an't coming in."</p> 
               <p>"I fear," said Edna, "that I shall never get well; and, O! what will become of poor Freddy?" Covering her face with the drapery of the bed, she gave vent to her feelings in smothered sobs.</p> 
               <p>"Poor, dear child!" said Prue, scarcely less affected; "don't you know that God always takes care of the little children, and he can do it just as well if you are not here as though you was? But we don't want you to leave us, for I think that the old ferry-house would always lack something now, if you was n't here. I was in hopes, when spring come, and the birds were singing, that you could take Freddy by the hand and go up the road to the old meeting-house, and hear the elder preach. You seem so kind of lonesome, I think it would do your heart good. He lifts a body right up off this earth, where there is so much sickness and pain, and tells them of another world, where the streets be all paved with gold. Not such gold as almost everybody is trying to get down here; but, O! I can't tell you, for I am nothing but a poor colored woman, and can't read, and I told him so; but he said the Lord loved me just as well as if I could read the Bible all through in Greek; and then he told me all about the poor fishermen, on the shore of Galilee, and how Christ<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5991-00000111"/> went down to the water and told them to lay by their nets and go with him. O, Miss Edna! how I love to think of these things! and sometimes in summer evenings, when the moon is shining, I feel so grateful to God for all his blessings, I can't stay in my little cabin,-so I go out and climb to the top of the old cannonrock, as mother used to call it, and there I kneel down and pray until I am impatient to be gone. But, then, it won't take long now before I shall be there; so I don't care much what comes acrost me the little time I have got to stay."</p> 
               <p>While the pious negress was talking, Edna listened attentively, not once turning her eyes from Prue's face. The words and the thoughts they awakened soothed and interested her, and when she ceased speaking the invalid took her hand and said, "You don't depend on the things of this world for happiness, and that is why you are so happy."</p> 
               <p>"No, Miss Edna, not now; I did once, and I see nothing but trouble. I was too much bound up in the love of the children God only lent me for a little while, and then at first, when he took them away to live with him, I thought I must die and go with them; and one night-O, dear! I shall never forget that night, for I was so wicked that I can't see how the Lord came to take pity on me!" And Prue sank back into a chair and closed her eyes, as if she would shut out the remembrance of the past.</p> 
               <p>Edna desired her to speak on, for there was a solacing influence in her words, and she loved to listen.</p> 
               <p>"I had sat all day beside the little bed of Johnny," said Prue, "and his little hand was so parched and dry<pb n=""/> that I wet it with my tears; and, just as the sun was going down, the old doctor came from Newtown, and when he came into the cabin with his saddle-bags on his arm and looked at the baby, I knew by the mournful shake of his head that we should soon have to dig another little grave by the side of his sisters'. So, when the good old man talked to me, I said nothing-only listened to the feeble moans of the last of my children. Cudjoe was away, and the tide was beginning to ebb; so the doctor did not leave me until the spirit of Johnny had gone out in company with the angels. I had n't told the neighbors how sick the baby was, for I was afraid that they might say that he would die; and, although I knew it must be so, I could n't bear to hear them say it. After a while the doctor went away, saying that he would stop at the ferry-house and tell them that Johnny was gone. Then I thought that <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland would come up; and, although I knew that she was my best earthly friend, I did not want to see her, for it seemed to me all I wanted was to die and be with my children.</p> 
               <p>"So I took the little patch-work quilt that covered my child and wrapped him in it, and went down to the water. As I went out I looked up to the moon and stars, for they were all out that night; but I could see no beauty in them. I hardly know how I got there, but still I remember climbing over the rocks, and then hugging the baby close to me, and plunging into the water. I can't remember any more for a long time, but they said the doctor thought I was crazy, so he did n't go home, as I supposed, but watched me from behind the curb to the sweep-well in the garden, and<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5991-00000112"/> when I went towards the river he followed me, and it was him that saved me from drowning."</p> 
               <p>Edna was so absorbed in the tale of Prue, that for the time she forgot her own suffering, and inquired if when they rescued her they saved the body of her child.</p> 
               <p>"No," answered the mother, mournfully. "His body lies beneath the waters of the Narraganset."</p> 
               <p>"You say that for a long time you remember nothing. Were you sick, Prue, after the death of your boy?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Miss Edna, sick in body and in mind; and then the elder came to see me, but at first I could not bear to hear him pray. But, as he read the Bible and told me how others had been afflicted who was more worthy than me, and explained how God meant it all for the best, I began to pray, too; and soon I felt that I would not have my children back, if I could. And now I see that it is all for the best."</p> 
               <p>"And, if it were the Lord's will, would you be willing to give up Sammy?" said Edna, looking steadily into the face of her nurse.</p> 
               <p>"I should," answered Prue, meekly; "for he is not mine, only lent, like his brothers and sisters, and when our Father in heaven calls for him, he must go." With these words she arose to mix the powder that had been ordered by the doctor. After it was taken, Edna felt exhausted, and closed her eyes as if sleeping. Her nurse stepped lightly around the room, and when she had put it in order went down stairs to see how the children were employed, and if Mrs. Ashland required her assistance.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Although Edna's eyes were closed, she was not asleep. From early youth she had met with but little else than disappointment and sorrow, until her heart had grown sick, and she felt that there was no relief save in the grave. But now, as she lay meditating, her thoughts seemed to afford her consolation, and ere the nurse returned to the bedside another prayer had ascended to the Throne Eternal.</p> 
               <p>Several days passed, during which time Edna suffered much; yet she did not complain, but seemed resigned to whatever awaited her. But we will not dwell upon her long and tedious illness, which at length yielded to the skill of an attentive physician, and the unwearied devotion of kind nurses. When once more able to join the group at the fireside, her cheek was pale, and her step lacked that elasticity which youth and health impart. Prue had returned to her cabin up the road, and Cudjoe had begun to loosen the soil in his little garden, preparatory to scattering the seeds and arranging for a plentiful supply of summer vegetables.</p> 
               <p>One pleasant afternoon, when dinner was over, and the bright rows of pewter plates were shining on the shelves behind the glass doors of the buffet in the corner, Mrs. Ashland placed her low chair before the fire, set her round Indian basket of mending on the dye-tub, and then, looking pleasantly at her daughter, inquired if she would like to take a trip over to town with Richard.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," answered Lucy, manifestly pleased. "Are you willing I should go?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, child. But be careful to wrap up warm, for<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5991-00000113"/> I always think that May is about as bad a month as any in the year to get cold, especially Quaker-meeting week."</p> 
               <p>"Why do you call it Quaker-meeting week, Mrs. Ashland?" said Edna, from the opposite corner, faintly smiling.</p> 
               <p>"Well, dear, if you don't know, I guess you have n't been in New England long. That is the time the Quakers have their yearly meeting to transact business, and one thing and another; and so sure is it to rain the week they assemble, that I do believe that if there had been any Quakers in Egypt there never would have been a drought there."</p> 
               <p>Lucy made a full stop at the door, which she was about to pass through, and, after listening to her mother's pleasant speech, said, laughingly, "Why, mother, that is quite a joke for <emph>thee</emph> to make. What if Friend Roberts should hear thee say that?" Then, with a roguish glance, she darted out of the room before Mrs. Ashland had time to say more.</p> 
               <p>The mother blushed deeply at her daughter's playful allusion to Friend Roberts; for, with electric speed, came back a vision of other days, when a stalwart form, dressed in snuff-colored velvet, his forehead protected by the broad brim of his beaver, would often seek her side at evening, and vainly plead for her to take a seat near him in the Friends' meeting-house on the Sabbath. That strong form now resided at Newport; and a once romping girl, the intimate friend of Mrs. Ashland, and who loved then to rally him on his unbecoming costume, now with pleasure walked to his favorite place of worship, and was mother of his four sons and pair of blooming daughters. Sometimes, when in merry<pb n=""/> mood, Mrs. Ashland would speak of the past, and jestingly refer to Friend Roberts; but, as Lucy mirthfully retorted, the crimson hue would mount to her temples, and the daughter would quickly disappear.</p> 
               <p>When Lucy returned to the kitchen fire she was prepared for her afternoon's trip, her shawl being wrapped closely around her, and her beaver jockey tied under her chin. Gayly bidding her mother and Edna good-by, she went into the great room to join those who were going down to the boat. After the Swallow left the pier, Mrs. Ashland stood at the window watching her progress; and as she passed under the lee of an outward bound brig that lay off in the bay, the mother almost repented allowing her daughter to cross the treacherous waves. But it was now too late to recall the past; and, with a wordless prayer to God for the safe return of her child, she went back to her low chair and the basket of mending.</p> 
               <p>Edna had taken up a garment that belonged to Richard, and was trying to close a ripped seam; but the farmer's wife advised her to lay it aside, as she thought her too weak yet to attempt any labor. Edna quietly did as she requested, with an air that seemed to express a desire to please her benefactress rather than to gratify her own inclinations; and then, leaning her head against the high back of the chair, she closed her eyes, and her thoughts wandered far away. As Mrs. Ashland repeatedly drew out her needle, and smoothed down the pieces that were to cover the worn portions of the garment that she held in her lap, she gave occasionally an anxious glance at the invalid, as if she would like to break in upon her revery, but scarcely<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5991-00000114"/> knew how. At length she laid her work in her lap, and said, pleasantly,</p> 
               <p>"Are you lonesome, child, without Freddy? If you are, I guess I can make Mr. Ashland hear with the shell; for I told him that if we wanted Freddy I would blow the shell, and he might let Cudjoe come down with him."</p> 
               <p>"O, you need not go to that trouble," replied Edna, arousing suddenly, as if she had just become aware how unsocial she was. "I think I miss Lucy quite as much as I do Freddy; and he is so happy in the field with Mr. Ashland, that I should not like to recall him unless you want him."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland assured her that it was not on her own account she spoke, and both relapsed into their former silence. After a brief space, the farmer's wife drew her chair nearer to Edna, and, taking her hand, said,</p> 
               <p>"Edna, dear, do you love me, and think me your friend?"</p> 
               <p>"I do," returned the other, growing a shade paler.</p> 
               <p>"And yet you do not seem happy with us. Is there not something more that we can do to gain your confidence, and make you know how much we want you to be happy, and feel that you are as welcome as our own child?"</p> 
               <p>"You have done all that could be done, Mrs. Ashland, and I know that I make you but a poor return for all that I have received at your hands; but God will reward you for your good deeds and kindness to the homeless and unfortunate."</p> 
               <p>"And how have you been so unfortunate, my poor child? Surely one so amiable could not do so much<pb n=""/> wrong that God would send afflictions to make her turn from her sinful ways!"</p> 
               <p>"Is it not a misfortune to have no one through all this wide world to love you, save strangers, who cherish you through kindliness of heart alone, because their generous feelings cannot bear to see suffering?" said Edna, not seeming to notice Mrs. Ashland's last remark.</p> 
               <p>"And is it long since you had a home?"</p> 
               <p>"Home-home!" repeated Edna, with a bitter smile. "That is too dear a word to be applied to a spot where one seeks shelter alone,-where there is no fond smile to greet you, nor warm heart to beat in unison with your own. If you ask me if I had been long without a shelter when I came here, I answer no; but if you ask me if I had been long without a <emph>home,</emph> I will say that to me it has seemed a prolonged lifetime since I was pressed to a loving heart, and felt the fond kiss of a mother on my cheek."</p> 
               <p>"Is your mother living now, Edna?" inquired Mrs. Ashland, kindly, and looking into her tear-bedewed face.</p> 
               <p>"The good never die," returned Edna, sobbing; and then, with a sudden effort repressing her tears, she begged Mrs. Ashland not to turn her from her door, and she would relate her past history.</p> 
               <p>"No, child, I will not," replied Mrs. Ashland. "If you tell me you have sinned, I will repeat the words spoken by him who with a divine mind wore the human form, 'Sin no more.' We are all human, and God will deal with us mercifully, though justly." And the kind matron waited for Edna to speak.</p> 
               <p>It was not an idle curiosity that prompted Mrs. Ashland to encourage the unhappy girl to tell her of the<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5991-00000115"/> past, but a desire to lessen her affliction, and heal the mind as well as the body.</p> 
               <p>After a short pause, in which Edna seemed to be deciding at what point to commence her narrative, she began with a description of her childhood's home, where her first thoughts were developed, beneath the penetrating eye of a kind mother, and her infant form cradled at evening by her fond nurse.</p> 
               <p>"I was born in merry England," said Miss Benton, "and the scenes of my childhood are fresh before me now. To me that quiet spot seemed a paradise; and how fairy-like its decorations! Plenty reigned throughout our home, and my every wish was gratified. Every wish, did I say? No, my memory now brings back my mother's tears, and my ardent longing to see her happy. When I inquired why she wept, she only answered with a kiss, and a closer pressure to her bosom. My father I seldom saw; only when he entertained favorite guests, and then he seemed to take a paternal pride in bedecking me in costly apparel, and as I grew larger I occupied a seat by his side at his table. Thus sped my childhood, until my stature attained almost its present growth; and then death came among us, and since that fatal hour I have never been happy, for it ever seems that when sorrow looks the most distant it is nearest."</p> 
               <p>Here the young girl bowed her head upon her hand, and her sobs were so heartfelt that it was some time ere she could resume her tale. When she did, she spoke of her father's removal to America, and did not end her narrative till she had told all, finishing with the stormy night on which she first sought a<pb n=""/> shelter at the ferry-house, hoping to cross the bay and take passage for England; but the vessel sailed before she arrived at Newport. "And that was the reason," said Edna, "that I returned and craved your charity of a home this winter."</p> 
               <p>Edna had told her benefactress all,-of her luxurious English home, of the removal to America of her father's family, of the unkindness to her of one who had promised to love, cherish, and protect her through life, and of her present solitary condition; but she had not mentioned Charles Aylesbury, for she dared not trust herself with his name upon her lips. She thought that the waves had rolled over his lifeless clay, and it was her duty now to strive to forget him; and often had she knelt in that chamber where ended the midnight interview with him whom she loved better than all the world beside, and prayed for strength from above, to aid her in her effort mentally to bury the dead.</p> 
               <p>"Poor child!" exclaimed Mrs. Ashland, when Edna ceased speaking, "you have seen sorrow; but stay with us now, my dear. I cannot blame you for anything you have done. You could not have done less and performed your duty; so dry up your tears, and, come what will, you shall always find a home here. Mr. Ashland and I know but little difference between you and Lucy, and, if you are a good girl, the longer you stay the better we shall love you. In the course of a few weeks, when you get a little stronger, we intend to pay you a few pounds, now and then, for your services, and then you can fix yourself and Freddy out just as you please. So now don't fret<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5991-00000116"/> any more, dear child. If you have got all you love with you, why, let others take care of themselves. We live so far away from them that they will never think of looking here for you. Why, it is a dreadful ways by land up to Providence, and a very bad road to travel, too. Now, when you wanted to sail for England, it would have been much the better way for you to have got into a packet at Providence, and gone right down to Newport."</p> 
               <p>"I know it now," answered Edna; "but I did not come directly from Providence, when I came here, for I had been away from where I resided several weeks."</p> 
               <p>Thus Mrs. Ashland and Edna talked on, until the afternoon was well-nigh spent, each moment the guest becoming more communicative and less constrained in her manner. At length Mrs. Ashland arose to look across the bay, to see if the Swallow were yet in sight, when she saw her daughter walking up the path, leading Freddy by the hand, while he was prattling and pointing to several ears of speckled corn that he held in the front breadth of his little plaid josey, and which he had just selected from the corn-crib.</p> 
               <p>When Edna heard the child's voice outside of the door, she once more repeated her thanks for the kindness she had received at the ferry-house, expressing her gratitude for the past, and saying how pleased she was that she and Freddy could still have a home there, as she had altered her intention, and did not wish to return to England; and then she begged Mrs. Ashland not to relate to another what she had told her that afternoon.</p> 
               <p>The farmer's wife promised that she would not to<pb n=""/> any one save her husband, who felt as much interested in her happiness as she did. At this moment Lucy and Freddy entered, and, with a loud, happy laugh, the latter ran up to Edna, showing his treasures, and telling how pleasantly he had passed the afternoon in the field, and had just returned to the crib with father Ashland, when he saw Lucy coming up the path, and ran to meet her. When the child had finished his tale, Lucy had various wonders to relate, of what she had seen during her short stay in town,-what beautiful chintzes she saw up at the windows of the shops, and when she inquired the prices of them they were but two-and-sixpence a yard,-and when huckleberries were ripe she intended to pick enough and send over to town to buy her one.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland made no answer to this hint of Lucy's that she wanted another new dress that was not manufactured on the farm; but, taking down the strong-lunged bellows, she began to infuse new life into the dying embers, while her back hid from her daughter the smile that played over her features, and expressed the pleasure she felt in her buoyant spirits.</p> 
               <p>Edna did not retire until later than usual, for she seemed more interested than she had previously in the pleasant conversation among the members of the family, and in which she occasionally made some remarks. From this period Miss Benton continued to gain strength rapidly, and the bloom gradually returned to her cheek; not that she forgot Charles, but she felt it her duty to banish all regret and murmuring, and humbly submit to the dispensations of Him who governs all with wisdom.</p>

               <p>WHEN Nathan fell beside Monieda, he closed his eyes to the sunlight, and buried his face within the faded moss that tenaciously clung to the rock, while the dagger still quivered in its fleshy sheath. Terror had so prostrated his energies that he had not power to withdraw the weapon or raise the maiden from her fallen posture; but not so did fear act on the nerves and muscles of the mother, for, with almost magnetic speed, with one hand she plucked the softest tufts of moss that grew at her feet, while with the other she gently drew forth the dagger, and attempted to stanch the blood. No word escaped her lips, for she had witnessed all from the door of her cabin, and knew that the blow was accidental. After placing the moss over the surface of the wound, she took from her waist the girdle that confined her blanket below the shoulders, and, raising Monieda's head to her knee, bound it around her body; then, turning to Nathan,<pb n=""/> who had but half risen from the rock, she said, reproachfully,</p> 
               <p>"Don't be a dog, and seek to hide from what you have done; but help me carry her into the wigwam, and lay her on the mats, where I can make her comfortable, and then go for the medicine-man, Kansko."</p> 
               <p>The words of Wenoma seemed to bring Nathan to a sense of his inactivity and childish behavior where so much exertion was needed. Without replying, he raised Monieda in his arms, and bore her to the bed in the cabin; then, hurriedly darting from the door, with a quick pace he went down the footpath that led to the thicker settlement.</p> 
               <p>When he was gone, Wenoma gently pulled the bed from its close proximity to the partition, and, noiselessly gliding in between it and the wall, bent over her daughter, and, in a low tone, inquired if she felt very badly; and then added,</p> 
               <p>"If the Great Spirit take you, I must wrap my blanket about me, and lay down beside you; for I cannot stay here alone."</p> 
               <p>"And if I live after you, mother, who will love and care for me?-for, when the Father calls you, there will be no one left but me in our cabin."</p> 
               <p>"You may yet marry the son of a chief, Monieda; for does not the young hunter that lives on the borders of the Connecticut, among the Pequods, say he loves you? and did he not, a few moons since, ask you to share his blanket and his wigwam, and promise you, if you would become his bride, that you should never lack for venison nor the fur of the beaver?"</p> 
               <p>"The young hunter is good," said Monieda, faintly,<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5991-00000118"/> and pressing her hand over the wound, from which the blood continued to trickle slowly; "but he can never be the husband of Monieda; for he cannot read the books of the pale-faces, neither would he provide the comforts in his home which I must have to make me happy. The Indian makes his wife bear the burdens which his strong arm alone should carry. I shall never wed, mother, unless I wed with a pale-face."</p> 
               <p>Wenoma made no answer, but there was an expression of sadness on her features, and she slowly turned away to look down the path. Soon Monieda inquired if Nathan would return. The mother replied that he would-that he was gone for Kansko to come and see how badly she was wounded, and to apply healing remedies.</p> 
               <p>Monieda said that she did not think the wound was deep; but the suddenness of the blow had caused her to fall, and she had received more injury from her head striking the rock than from the point of the dagger. But a short time passed before her quick ear heard the approach of footsteps; and the mother, returning to the window, saw Nathan coming up the path, followed by a stranger. Both entered, and Nathan quickly passed up to Monieda's bedside, and tenderly expressed his sorrow for the trouble and pain he had caused her. The young girl gently laid her hand in his, and begged him to think no more of it, for she would be well in a few days, and no one need know of the accident but those present.</p> 
               <p>Not far from a little clump of trees, which were enclosed by a low stone wall, near the beach, there stood a small and singularly-constructed hut,-some<pb n=""/> called it a cave, for one half was roofed by a high, overhanging rock,-which was the home of old Kansko and his squaw. It contained but little furniture; none save a few articles that had been presented to the old medicine-man, or doctor, as the dwellers of the town called him, by those who had faith in his skill. This shady and cool retreat was the favorite resort of many of the younger branches of the families of Newport; for they thought the old squaw was deeply read in the mysteries of the future. If a young man, therefore, became enamored of a pair of dark eyes, or felt his heart beat quicker when some admired maiden passed him, he invariably sought the cave, and, dropping a few pieces of coin into old Nannito's deer-skin pouch, received the desired information whether he was ever to be the accepted <emph>lovier</emph> of his favorite. If all did not transpire exactly as was prophesied, this did not discourage either him or her; for the untoward event was generally attributed to almost any cause but the right. The practice was not confined to one sex, and in summer Nannito rarely spent an evening alone.</p> 
               <p>To this spot Nathan repaired when he left the cabin; not that he had any faith in the jargon and dried herbs that the old Indian employed, but he went to gratify Wenoma. Reflecting, too, that it was on the way to the house of Dr. Hammond, who was at that time considered the best physician in Newport, and that he could reach the hut more quickly than he could the residence of the former, he resolved to tell Kansko to go to the cabin; but he did not feel unhappily disappointed when he found no one within but the fortune-<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5991-00000119"/> teller. He said nothing of his errand; but, after being informed by Nannito that her husband had gone out in his canoe fishing, he said he was passing and had just stopped in to inquire after her health. The squaw seemed pleased by the compliment, and produced from her pocket a curious shell, saying that she found it while roaming along the beach, and, by certain sounds that it emitted, intelligible to her ear alone, she could read fortunes much more correctly now. Nathan bowed gravely, as if he had full confidence in her statement, and, after a hasty good-day, went out.</p> 
               <p>The stranger who came up the foot-path with Nathan was Dr. Hammond. After he had deposited his saddle-bags on the table, and taken the surface-chill from his hands, he stepped into the little bed-room where Monieda lay. After a few remarks, he gently removed the girdle from over the wound, and probed its depth; then, turning to the mother and Nathan, who stood anxiously by, he told them that he did not apprehend danger, but she must remain very quiet for a few days, and partake of low diet; the weapon had struck into the fleshy part of the side and glanced off, the heart being defended by the ribs.</p> 
               <p>"It was, indeed, almost a miracle," said the doctor, "that instant death was not caused by the blow; for it is plain that a trifling deviation either way from the course that the weapon took must have proved fatal."</p> 
               <p>While Dr. Hammond was dressing the wound, Nathan left the side of Monieda, and paced back and forth in the kitchen. He never felt that he loved the beautiful girl until now; and, as he listened to the words of the doctor, and realized how narrow was her<pb n=""/> escape from death by his hands, he involuntarily placed his hand on his pocket-book, as if by gold he would make amends.</p> 
               <p>That night Nathan did not leave Wenoma's cabin; but, going out a little way, he gathered a large armful of wood, and a basket of chestnut-chips that the woodman's axe had manufactured the previous week. Upon his return he replenished the fire, and, opening the bedroom door, inquired if Monieda would have him do or get anything for her comfort.</p> 
               <p>"No," replied the girl, with a look that expressed to Nathan how much he was beloved by her. Then, drawing a chair near her pillow, he spoke of everything that he thought would please her, or cause her to repose confidence in his love; not that he seriously thought she would ever be his bride, but it was pleasant to be loved, and he wished to retain her affections.</p> 
               <p>"Would you not like to leave this hut?" said Nathan, as the bright blaze of the fire grew dim. "This is a comfortless spot for one of your taste; for my part, I would as lief spread my bed beneath the stiffened branches of the forest-trees, as to remain where the wintry snows come drifting even up to the very hearth."</p> 
               <p>"Winter is past now," said Monieda.</p> 
               <p>"I know it, dearest. But are not the summer rains almost as disagreeable when they come pattering through the leaky roof?"</p> 
               <p>After a moment's consideration, she said,</p> 
               <p>"Of what use are vain regrets, Nathan? We have no shelter but this, and here I must remain while my mother lives; for she would not be contented without<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5991-00000120"/> me, nor would I go to the town to reside without her, if she would."</p> 
               <p>"You need not, Monieda," replied Nathan, taking from his pocket the slip of paper he had received from the owner of the little house on the knoll. "See here, I have a present to make you. An acquaintance of mine owns a little cottage in the back part of the town, and he said I might have it very cheap, if I would hire it. He meant this as a joke when he first spoke, for he knew that I had no wife to live in it; but I took him at his word, and have hired it for you and your mother."</p> 
               <p>He reached her the piece of paper, and then brought from the table without the bayberry candle, that she might read the lines.</p> 
               <p>After shading her eyes with her hand, Monieda glanced over it, and then, handing it back, said, inquiringly, "Your name is not on it."</p> 
               <p>For a moment the young man was a little disconcerted; but, as he arose to replace the light before he answered, it gave time for his active brain to manufacture a suitable reply. So he said,</p> 
               <p>"I told you that the owner was an acquaintance of mine, but I did not mean that exactly. I know him very well by sight, but he does n't know my name; for I never spoke with him until to-day, and then it was about business."</p> 
               <p>"But how came he to know that you were not married?"</p> 
               <p>"O, everybody knows that," said Nathan, laughing, "for they know that I won't be so imprudent as to get married until I have a few acres of my own. But<pb n=""/> come, my little inquisitive miss, when you get well will you gratify me by moving down to the little cottage? There we can have a little <emph>great room</emph> by ourselves when I come to see you, and a nice glass-door buffet for your books, and a pretty little garden-patch for vegetables and flowers. And I shall come oftener to see you, for I shall not feel afraid that the crazy old sides of the cabin will collapse when I am there, and bury me in its ruins, as I do here."</p> 
               <p>Monieda smiled at the ridiculous picture of her present home drawn by Nathan; and she felt pleased, too, at this proof of his thoughts when away from her. She questioned him no more, but said, confidentially,</p> 
               <p>"I shall love to live there, Nathan, if you can get mother's consent; and I hope I may ever feel grateful for your kindness to us, for I have naught but gratitude to repay you with."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't speak of it, Monieda. If I were able, I would do more for you than that. I would provide you with such a home that even kings might envy its splendor."</p> 
               <p>Then, saying that more conversation would fatigue her, he respectfully kissed her forehead, and bade her try to sleep, and he would tarry through the night to see that nothing unfavorable took place in regard to her; and in the mean time he would try to persuade her mother to consent to the removal as soon as she was well enough to bear the undertaking.</p> 
               <p>As Nathan left the bed-room his mind reverted to the scenes of the morning, and he almost felt that he would take the money he had so dishonestly procured, and expend it in some generous deed, and then, by<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5991-00000121"/> restoring Richard to his aged parent, atone for the past. Then there came another thought. Should he, to appease a cowardly conscience, make himself almost penniless, when he could so easily hide his faults? What if the old man had said that his purse should be at his command? Could he bear to see Richard exalted, and he become the recipient of his bounty? "No, never!" mentally exclaimed the young man. "Sooner than make him rich and happy, I would carry a guilty conscience to the grave."</p> 
               <p>After reflecting a while, Nathan approached the fireside, where Wenoma was sitting, brooding over her troubles. Sitting down, he described to her the quiet and beauty of the home he offered. Time passed on, and when Nathan drew out his watch to learn the hour, the finger on the dial pointed to twelve; but he had gained the point for which he had been laboring. Wenoma and her daughter were to remove to the cottage as soon as Monieda should be well enough to go.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan withdrew his watch from its fob, Wenoma arose, and, going to the window, looked out upon the stars to ascertain the hour of the night, as if she could not trust to the bauble that the young man held in his hand.</p> 
               <p>"The sun has slept half of his allotted time," said the aged woman, returning and taking a warm robe of skins from the tip of a broken antler that was fastened to the wall.</p> 
               <p>"What time is it?" said Nathan, wishing to learn if she could really tell the time by the situation of the moon and the stars.</p> 
               <p>"It is the noon of night," replied Wenoma; and,<pb n=""/> handing him the robe, she bade him sleep by the fire while she would cautiously lie beside Monieda.</p> 
               <p>"Is it not better that I should watch by the fire," said Nathan, "for fear that Monieda may wake and need something, or that her wound may bleed afresh?"</p> 
               <p>The mother shook her head, and answered, "The bear always prefers to guard its cub; I shall rest, but not sleep."</p> 
               <p>Nathan was tired with the previous night's vigil and the day's excitement, and needed no second invitation to sleep; and soon the warm stone hearth yielded him as welcome a bed as the most downy couch to the unwearied.</p> 
               <p>The sun had drunk up nearly all the hovering mists when the tired sleeper awoke from his flinty couch. Bright rays struggled in through the low, antique window, lighting up the loose and smoky rafters, and contrasting the outward beauty of nature with the cheerless scenes within.</p> 
               <p>When Wenoma heard Nathan pacing the floor, she quietly rose from the side of the yet sleeping Monieda, and went out to prepare breakfast for all. As she produced the remains of yesterday's repast, Nathan said, "Is this the fare that Monieda will have to-day?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Wenoma, "I shall prepare her a better dinner; but I must husband the game that she has caught, or we shall soon be obliged to fast. There will be no light feet to bound through the forest, and set the snare."</p> 
               <p>The young man immediately started towards the town, and when he returned deposited such dainties<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5991-00000122"/> upon the table as had not been beneath Wenoma's roof for a long period. Wenoma did not refuse the gifts, but there was a dissatisfied expression upon her face, which would not have been there had she bartered the articles her industry had manufactured in return.</p> 
               <p>Noon had nearly come when Nathan inquired for the copy of the letter he had left there.</p> 
               <p>"Bring my little writing-table to the bedside, mother," said Monieda; and when this was done, she took out the copy, so well imitated that it were difficult to determine which writing was the original.</p> 
               <p>Nathan was satisfied, and, telling her to burn the rest, and that he might want to employ her many times yet, he promised to return in a week, and see how she was, and assist them to carry their scanty furniture to the cottage on the knoll.</p> 
               <p>When the young man had pressed his lips to the forehead of the dark-eyed girl for the last time, and expressed his sorrow for the accident he had caused, he took the hand of Wenoma, bidding her good-by, and then wended his way towards the town, whence he intended to return to the Narraganset side, as soon as he had called on one or two dealers in produce, and ascertained the prices they paid for potatoes. In his walk towards the water he avoided the streets that led to the inn where he had spent so much of the previous morning, lest he should meet Jacques out upon some errand for his master. Neither did he wish to call at Mrs. Howden's, for the contrast between the society of the pure-minded and beautiful girl he had just left and the coarse demeanor and language of the masculine woman was too great for present enjoy-<pb n=""/> ment. Nor did he wish to make excuses to George for not returning to pass the evening in his company, as agreed upon. He felt there would have been excitement, and perhaps pleasure, in the novelty of his situation among the quality, and the contrast at Jack Weaver's might have been amusing. But, as he expected that he would have had to pay the bills, he was glad to have been otherwise engaged. After the letter had been satisfactorily disposed of, he took the street that led to the narrow wharf, where he found the Swallow nearly ready to start for the opposite shore.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan reached the farm-house all the inmates seemed pleased to see him. Even Lucy laughed and chatted, and asked about what he had seen, appearing to forget for the moment how much she disliked him. After handing a showy toy to Freddy, and inquiring for Edna, and satisfying all their questions, he went to his room to doff his holiday suit for his farm attire.</p> 
               <p>And now, reader, let us pass on for two or three years, and then I will introduce you to the old ferry-house again.</p>

               <p>THREE years have passed away since the scenes in our last chapter were enacted; and still the rocky seawall that girts the cliffy shores of the Narraganset is washed by the white-crested surge, as it was on that night when the storm-king was abroad, and the stiffened limbs of the protecting oak that sheltered the ferry-house creaked and groaned as they were swayed by that mighty monarch.</p> 
               <p>Three years, did I say? Not quite, for the rustling grass-blades proclaim that it is summer now, and the golden harvest must be gathered ere that time be fully past since Edna sought a home with the Ashland family. The peak of the lofty hill in the back-ground stood between the cottage of Prue and the sinking sun, and the green and sloping hill-side lent a coolness to the atmosphere, and furnished a play-ground to the pet and his companion. It was early June now, and the day<pb n=""/> had been unusually sultry. But, as evening drew nigh, the scorched inhabitants of the ferry-house went out upon the rocks, as if to woo the sea-breeze shoreward, that it might bear off in its roaming mission the lassitude that had crept over them at noon. Not all the members of the family were sitting or reclining on the rocks, for Edna had taken Freddy by the hand, passed out at the little wicket-gate, and then along the green foot-path up the road.</p> 
               <p>As she saw Cudjoe leaning on the low bars that guarded his possessions from any bestial intruder, she bowed pleasantly, and then, as she came nearer, inquired if Prue was within.</p> 
               <p>"I guess not, Mistress," said Cudjoe, straightening his dwarfish form, and attempting to make himself very agreeable. "I think it's likely she gone up to neighbor Stacy's; they got a darter very sick, and she staid there all day yesterday, and to-day I been looking round for pennyrial, and one yarb and another, to see if we can't help her a little."</p> 
               <p>"Prue has a very kind heart, and is skilful too," said Edna, mentally glancing backward to the time when she experienced her soothing care. "I sometimes think that she is quite as necessary in a sick room as the doctor himself."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, marm," returned the other, evidently pleased at the compliment bestowed on his wife, and showing a polished set of teeth which nature and time had left untarnished.</p> 
               <p>At this moment the turbaned head of Prue was discerned rising from behind a currant-bush where she had been employed weeding an onion-bed. The once<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5991-00000124"/> chubby Sammy, who had now grown to quite a tall boy, was by her side; and, as he recognized the sound of Edna's voice, he bounded forward, and invited Freddy to come and see the little speckled pig his father had given him that day. As the two boys hastened away together, and disappeared behind the corner of the house, Edna advanced to the rough bench before the door of the cottage, and they all seated themselves. There was a great change in the looks of Edna since the reader last met her at the farm-house. Her form was round and well developed, and the flush of health sat on her cheek. The natural brilliancy, too, had returned to her expressive eyes; but still there was a shade of sadness upon her beautiful features, which gave a hue to every word and action.</p> 
               <p>For a little while the old couple inquired about the farm,-how Mr. Ashland got along with his hoeing, and when he intended to commence haying, etc.,-to all of which questions Miss Benton gave satisfactory replies; and then Prue stepped within, and brought out a large Bible, covered with green baize, and placed it on the lap of her guest, saying,</p> 
               <p>"I know what you come for, darter,-to read to old Cudjoe and me. You're a blessed good gal, and it don't seem to me that I should ever stop crying, if you should leave the old house now."</p> 
               <p>"Lucy would read to you, if I were away," said Edna, parting the leaves of the wide Bible, and finding the place where a brown thread indicated that she had left off the previous evening.</p> 
               <p>"O, I know it," answered Prue, hurriedly, as if fearful she had cast some reflection on the ferryman's<pb n=""/> daughter; "but Lucy don't seem to like to read the Bible quite as well as you do; but, then, she is a good gal, and is very good at helping her mother."</p> 
               <p>Presently Prue continued, "I don't see what makes Mr. and <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland think so much of Nathan. Why, they don't seem to want to hear a word said against him, and they never blame him for anything that happens, let it be ever so bad."</p> 
               <p>Edna colored a little, and was very busy finding the verse where she wished to begin to read, as she answered, "Nathan has been on the farm a long time now, and he understands how Mr. Ashland wants everything done; so that it relieves him of a great deal of care to have Nathan take the lead in the field, and see that all goes right."</p> 
               <p>"Well, perhaps it does," said Prue, rather thoughtfully; while Cudjoe remarked that Nathan was a smart boy, and that very few could hoe a row with him, or keep step with him in haying-time. Then the old couple placed themselves in a listening attitude, while Edna, in a slow, distinct voice, read to them from the sacred book.</p> 
               <p>When Freddy and Sammy had satisfied themselves in looking at the speckled pig, and in examining the pen that contained him, they sprang over the fence at the back of the house, and took their way to the hillside of which we have spoken. Here they stretched their forms along the earth, crushing the wild-flowers which grew there luxuriantly; and then, looking up, they began to ruminate, and remark upon the great world they inhabited.</p> 
               <p>"What a big pond of water!" said Sammy, looking<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5991-00000125"/> out upon the Atlantic; and then continued, "What do you suppose makes a big vessel stay on the top of the water, when, if I throw a little stone in it, it goes down, right out of sight, and I never see it any more?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know," answered Freddy; "but Edna knows, and she says when I am old enough to study more I shall know too."</p> 
               <p>"Do you suppose, Freddy, that if I could find a stone just the shape of a boat, and put sails in it, it would sink?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sammy; because stones was n't made to build boats of. God wants men to make them of wood; so He teaches them how to make them stick on the top of the water. Edna calls it the power of gravity."</p> 
               <p>"O, would n't it be a nice thing, Freddy, to know how to read as fast as Edna does, without spelling any words, or stopping only just when you had a mind to?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Sammy; and I shall soon know how, and then I will teach you."</p> 
               <p>"I don't want to wait so long," said the little thirster for knowledge; and he bent his gaze to the ground, and, plucking a bright-hued flower, asked his companion if he knew who made the flowers so beautiful, and why some were red, and others white, and the grass green, and everything so different.</p> 
               <p>"Why, don't you know?" said Frederick, pleased to become a teacher; "the elder, and Edna, and everybody, says that God made all the stars, and flowers, and everything that is in the world."</p> 
               <p>"And do you think he is good, Freddy?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; did n't he make everything beautiful?"</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Not everything, Freddy," said the other child, sadly, glancing at his ebony-hued hands; "for he made me black."</p> 
               <p>Frederick remained silent a moment, and looked steadily at Sammy, as if he would say something to comfort him, but was puzzled to think of just what; but in an instant he remarked, "I would n't care, if I was black, if I was you; because you won't tan, and if your face gets dirty nobody need know it; and, besides, everybody loves you just as well as though you was white."</p> 
               <p>"No, they don't, Freddy; for most all the little boys call me nigger, and say I shan't go to school where they do, and say that when the schoolmaster boards round he shan't come to my house, for he don't like niggers."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then, I will ask Edna to teach you, for she loves you; and she knows as much as the schoolmaster, I think, although she never said so; and I will lend you my book that I read in last winter."</p> 
               <p>"O, that will be nice," said Sammy; "and then I can be with you 'most all the time." Then, as his companion took from his pocket a primer, he drew nearer, and both sat erect, while Frederick explained the pictures, and read the trials and triumphs of the heroes whose histories were portrayed there.</p> 
               <p>It was growing dark before the book was finished, and when the boys returned to the cottage Sammy's parents and their guest had taken seats within. Going up to Edna, and putting his arm around her neck, Frederick asked her to teach Sammy to read, write, and cipher.</p> 
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5991-00000126"/> 
               <p>Prue looked on in silence; but, when Edna answered in the affirmative, she threw her arms around Freddy, exclaiming, "O, the Lord bless you, child! it does my old eyes good to look at you. I am sure Sammy can never pay you for all you do for him. I never expected to see Sammy cipher; but, if he does get a good deal of larning, I shouldn't wonder but what some of these days he may become a preacher of the Gospel. O! I feel to bless the Lord for all his goodness; if that should happen, I should be willing to die, for I know that I should depart in peace."</p> 
               <p>"I have been thinking, for some time," said Edna, "of trying to get up a school. There is a rough room adjoining the corn-crib, that Mr. Ashland says he will fit up for that purpose, and there are several of the neighbors that say they would like to send their children."</p> 
               <p>"Can <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland spare you?" said Prue, growing enthusiastic; "she has such a heap of work to do all the time."</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, Aunty; for Lucy and I are up with the first song of the birds, in the morning, and long before nine o'clock the cheese is in the press, and the milk-pans are all scalded, ready for the cows at night."</p> 
               <p>The group talked on, until it was arranged that the next week, if nothing occurred to prevent, Edna should open a school for reading, writing, ciphering, sewing, knitting, and most of the accomplishments of the age. And, in the mean time, Prue was to call around among the neighbors, within a circuit of five miles from the farm-house, and ascertain who were ambitious to have their children taught in the summer season.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Soon Cudjoe arose to build a little fire of brush, outside, to attract the mosquitos from within; and then Edna took Freddy by the hand to go. Sammy cast a wishful look at his mother, and then glanced at the departing guests. Prue was a good interpreter of her child's thoughts; so she said,</p> 
               <p>"Can't you let Freddy stay all night? He can sleep in the big bed, in the great room; Sammy wants him to so bad!"</p> 
               <p>"Do," whispered the boy to Edna. "I will come home early in the morning; and Sammy knows lots of stories about-about Pilgrim's Progress, and all that. Will you?"</p> 
               <p>Edna hesitated a moment; but, as she perceived the tears beginning to glisten in the large, black eyes of Sammy, and saw how the child's disappointment afflicted the mother, she consented, and was soon on her way down the cart-path, alone.</p> 
               <p>It was almost time for the tenants of the barn-yard to be astir before the boys slept, for each one proposed more questions to the other than all the wisdom of the age could answer.</p> 
               <p>Edna had not proceeded far down the road when a young man sprang over the fence, and said, "Good evening, Miss Benton. Are you not afraid to be out alone at this time in the evening?"</p> 
               <p>"No," said Edna, returning his smile and bow of recognition. "The quiet influence of the Ashland family extends as far as this, certainly."</p> 
               <p>"True; but, if you have no objection, I will see you safely within the old ferry-house before I leave you."</p> 
               <p>Edna gave permission, and they walked down the path<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5991-00000127"/> together, where the clover-blossoms in the adjacent fields made the air redolent with their sweet perfume. At first they talked pleasantly of what would naturally interest two of their ages and situations; but at length the common topics of conversation seemed to be exhausted, and both were silent. The pause did not continue long, however, for the young man inquired of his companion if she would like to go to Tower Hill to meeting next Sunday.</p> 
               <p>"I think not, Daniel," replied Edna; "Mr. Ashland's family always expect me to attend meeting with them, and it is so far to Tower Hill that it would take the most of the Sabbath to go and come."</p> 
               <p>"That is the reason I invite you," returned he, archly; "for there is no more agreeable way for me to spend the day than in your society."</p> 
               <p>Edna did not smile, and her voice trembled as she answered, "O, don't speak so, Daniel, but remember what I told you when we last met,-that I could never be anything more to you than a friend, and to think of me only as such."</p> 
               <p>"And why can you not permit me to hope that at some future day you will be mine? for you have told me that I am not disagreeable to you."</p> 
               <p>"True, Daniel, no one who appreciates nobleness of character could find in you aught but a pleasant companion; and you will, at some future time, meet with some one who has a heart to give in exchange for yours. But do not expect it in me, for, alas! I have no heart to give, if I would." Her hand trembled so violently, as it lay upon his arm, that he involuntarily took it in his, and told her that henceforth he<pb n=""/> would pain her no more by alluding to his love for her, but would try to overcome it for her sake.</p> 
               <p>"And yet," he continued, "it seems mysterious to me that one so young and lovely should meet with such sorrow as to avoid the world, and all hearts that are devoted to her; for I am aware that I am not the only one who has been rejected by you, since you came among us."</p> 
               <p>"To whom do you refer?" said Edna, anxiously.</p> 
               <p>Daniel hesitated a moment, and then answered, "Well, it is no secret that Nathan Fossett loves you, and you have refused him, for he told me so."</p> 
               <p>"Nathan Fossett <emph>loves me!</emph>" repeated Edna, ironically. "If he did, he would not persist in that which he knows is so disagreeable." And then, after a short pause, she continued, "I think you are a friend to me, Daniel, and I can trust you."</p> 
               <p>"You can, Edna; so speak freely, as you would to a brother."</p> 
               <p>"Nathan fancies, but never <emph>loves,</emph> for each new face obliterates the last. While he is with the object that pleases him, he pretends the greatest devotion; but let distance divide them, and she is forgotten."</p> 
               <p>Daniel and his companion had now reached the little gate that opened into the lawn before the door of the old farm-house; and as Edna passed in, and was about thanking him for his protection, and bidding him good-night, Lucy came bounding out to meet her.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Daniel Greene," she said, playfully, "where did you meet my sister? Up at Aunty Prue's, I dare say; for she spends almost every evening with her and Uncle Cudjoe."</p> 
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5991-00000128"/> 
               <p>"Well," said Richard, coming up behind her, "suppose we have a chat with her and Daniel now." And then all took seats on a rustic bench, beneath the old oak, and conversed gayly until they heard the great eight-day clock, in the kitchen corner, strike ten, when they separated; Richard going to his chamber, and Daniel to the old homestead, two miles up the road, where he was spending a few weeks of the warm season with his parents, before returning to New York to engage in business again.</p> 
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Ashland had full confidence in the integrity of each member of their family, and did not watch every movement to see at what hour they retired, or in what direction they walked when they went out to enjoy the invigorating air of the summer evenings; so, although the clock had struck ten when Lucy and Edna went into the house, they did not immediately seek their rooms, but took seats on the low sill of the porch-door, and talked in low tones, while ever and anon they would cast their eyes in the direction of the water, and watch the reflections of the stars as they danced upon its surface.</p> 
               <p>"Shall you never marry?" said Lucy to Edna.</p> 
               <p>"No," answered Edna.</p> 
               <p>It was some time before either spoke again, and then Lucy was the first to break the silence, as she said,</p> 
               <p>"Do you know that Richard talks of going away?" She tried to speak cheerfully, but before Edna could reply she burst into tears, and buried her face on her adopted sister's neck.</p> 
               <p>"O, he won't go, Lucy. Don't you know he talked<pb n=""/> of going once before, and you persuaded him to stay, and he gave it up?"</p> 
               <p>"I know he did then, sister, but he has different causes now. He says that Nathan has grown so insolent, and has such an influence over father, that, in spite of all his love for me, his life is very uncomfortable. Besides, he can do a great deal better than to remain here for the poor pay father gives him. There was a captain over in town, the other day, offered him the berth of first mate of a large ship that is going to sail very soon; and one of the owners said that if he gave satisfaction he would soon furnish him with a ship, where he could be captain. But, O, dear! how can I part from him so long?-perhaps forever!"</p> 
               <p>"Others have parted before," said Edna, mournfully, and twining her arm around Lucy's neck, "and will never meet again until the sea gives up its dead."</p> 
               <p>"I know it, sister; but his absence will be no less hard to bear. How I shall miss his smile at evening, when we all sit around the fire in winter! And how cheerless a spot will the old blue dye-tub be to me, where he has so often sat engrossed with his books and studies! But why is it, Edna, that you never love any one? There is Daniel Greene; I know a good many girls that would be glad to get him, and he loves you, and still you seem to care nothing for him. I sometimes think you act very strangely."</p> 
               <p>"No, Lucy, not strange for one who has resolved never to marry."</p> 
               <p>"And why not? If I were as free as you are, and had no kindred, I would not refuse one so good and well-situated as Daniel Greene."</p> 
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5991-00000129"/> 
               <p>"O, say no more, Lucy! I feel sad to-night, and would rather not converse about those things, and the hour is late too; but still there is one thing more I should like to mention."</p> 
               <p>"Speak, Edna."</p> 
               <p>"You know we have several times spoken of teaching school."</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"Well, to-night I was talking to Prue about it, and she says she knows that she can get me quite a number of scholars, as she has heard several of the neighbors say they would like to send their children to a summer school. Do you think that your father could prepare the room so that I could begin next Monday?"</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, I think so, and I will ask him in the morning."</p> 
               <p>"Do," said Edna; and then, kissing Lucy's cheek, she arose and went to her chamber.</p>

               <p>THE following morning Prue's breakfast was on the round-leafed table at an earlier hour than usual, for she felt that she had an important day's work to do. She was going to do Edna a favor; so, when Cudjoe had fed his poultry and pigs, he had no leisure to hoe in the garden before his breakfast was ready; but he and his industrious partner sat down together and partook of their corn-bread, sweet butter, and the fresh eggs that he had just brought in from the coop.</p> 
               <p>"Is it best to wake the boys, father?" said Prue, cracking the snowy shell of another egg, "or will you see to their breakfast when they get up?"</p> 
               <p>"O, I'll take keer of them," replied Cudjoe. "Sleep's the best thing for their young eyes, for I believe they talked eenamost all night. I do think that Freddy is a remarkable child, and it beats all how well they have allers agreed; one allers thinks just like t' other."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and I tell you what it is, father, our Sammy's nobody's fool. See how he takes to larning; and I<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC5991-00000130"/> am so glad that the poor child can go to school, that I shall think nothing of traipsing 'round to-day, if I can only do some good by getting scholars."</p> 
               <p>When the meal was ended, and the table, with its contents, protected from roving insects, by a snowy cloth being thrown over it, Prue began to prepare for her long walk. Habiting herself in a linsey-woolsey petticoat and blue plaided cotton cooler, she took from the blue chest, at the foot of the bed in the great room, an antiquated black silk bonnet, and adjusted it over her bandanna turban; then, giving directions to Cudjoe how to proceed till her return, she departed.</p> 
               <p>Prue took the little foot-path near the wall that enclosed the perfumed meadows on the shady side of the road, and walked leisurely along until she came to the first farm-house where they had young children. This was Mrs. Potter's. She did not wait for ceremony, but, as the wide front door was thrown back, she entered, and inquired of a large girl who sat in the loom weaving if her mother was in, and was answered by the appearance of the one for whom she asked.</p> 
               <p>After the first salutations were over, Prue made known her errand; but Mrs. Potter did not seem to receive the proposal with much ardor. She said "her eldest gal could read and write and cipher, and she thought it was all nonsense to give gals so much larning; it made them lazy. It was a great deal better for them to learn to spin and weave, than to waste their time over books, doing nothing."</p> 
               <p>"We mean to give Joseph a pretty good education," said Mrs. Potter; "he always goes to school three<pb n=""/> months every winter, and he has ciphered as far as the Rule of Three already; but it an't so much consequence about gals."</p> 
               <p>"But can't you let Angeline go?" said Prue, feeling somewhat discouraged at being refused where she had made her first call.</p> 
               <p>"O, no, indeed; I want Angeline to home to take care of the baby, and do other little chores around. I don't believe in bringing up my gals in idleness."</p> 
               <p>Prue found that her visit was not going to be a very successful one; so she said no more about the school, but made some commonplace remarks, and then passed out into the road to visit Mrs. Rose, about a mile further from the ferry-house.</p> 
               <p>"Good-morning, marm," said Prue, as she walked up the path that led to the low, unpainted farm-house.</p> 
               <p>"Why, la! Prue, how do you do? Well, I declare, you must have got up pretty early to come so far this morning." And Mrs. Rose spread the white linen-strainer she held in her hand on the bushes, and went in at the front door, which was gracefully draped with a long string of red peppers, festooned to expose them to the sun to dry for future use.</p> 
               <p>"It is always a good way to get up early, Mrs. Rose," said Prue, not feeling quite at ease, nor knowing exactly how to begin, "'specially when we are going out to do an arrand of marcy."</p> 
               <p>"An errand of mercy!" repeated Mrs. Rose, throwing a hank of cotton over the swifts, and telling her daughter Mary Ann to go to quilling, for she should get into the loom in a minute. Then looking<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5991-00000131"/> at Prue, inquisitively, she said, "Is anybody sick around here?"</p> 
               <p>"O no, but-but-I come to do a good turn for a nice young woman that lives down to neighbor Ashland's. She wants to-I mean she is going to teach my Sammy. O dear me! I'll wait a minute till I get rested, and then I will tell you all about it."</p> 
               <p>"Well, do; for it is considerable of a walk from your house up here."</p> 
               <p>It was Prue's intention to enlist Mrs. Rose's sympathy for Edna, and induce her to send the majority of the small-sized group who were rolling and tumbling on the grass around the door to the proposed school. After a few moments' silence, she banished all remembrance of the previous visit, and explained the object of her call.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Rose did not give an immediate answer to Prue's question whether she would send the children. But, after meditating, and scanning the costumes and attitudes of the merry juveniles, she remarked,</p> 
               <p>"I should like to send all of the children to school, but my husband seems to think that if we give the boys a good education it is no matter about the girls." And then she gave a light sigh, and looked at Prue as if she would like to have her say more.</p> 
               <p>Prue continued her narrative about Edna's being a poor orphan girl, and obliged to do something for a living, and she tried to make all the circumstances appear as plain as possible. But when Mrs. Rose inquired who her parents were, and where she came from, her guest became rather embarrassed, and stammered out that the sun was getting pretty well up along,<pb n=""/> and so, if Mrs. Rose would give her an answer about the number of scholars she would send, she would be jogging on before it got to be very hot.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I think I can safely say, Prue, that we will send Harvey and Benjamin; and if I can get Mr. Rose to consent, why, Hannah and Ruth shall go too; for I think women ought to know something, as well as men."</p> 
               <p>"And they will know something too, in spite of them, whether they have book-larning or not; so you just send the gals along. A shilling a week won't kill anybody, especially any one so well off as neighbor Rose."</p> 
               <p>A light shade again passed over Mrs. Rose's features, as she replied, "I can't always have my own way, Prue; for my husband thinks, because we have but little learning, others can do without it well enough. Still, I have a little money laid by of my own, that I earned last winter making shirts for the schoolmaster, and knitting stockings for one and another over in town,-so I guess they will all come but Mary Ann; she is a very good reader now, so I suppose she need n't go any more until winter."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, thank you," said Prue, evidently pleased to meet with such good success where she was not expecting it; and, taking from her pocket a slip of blank paper, she marked down four hieroglyphics, designed as memoranda of her visit to Mrs. Rose, and its prosperous result.</p> 
               <p>We will not rehearse Prue's experience through this eventful day, but pass on until the afternoon shadows lengthened, and the sun had long since<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5991-00000132"/> reached the five-o'clock notch in the door-sill of the cottage.</p> 
               <p>"There comes mother!" exclaimed Sammy, as he cleared the zig-zag fence that surrounded the corn-field near his home, and with long leaps he was soon by her side.</p> 
               <p>"O, dear me!" he said, as soon as he could get breath, and with his shirt-sleeve wipe the dust and perspiration from his face. "I wish you would never go away anywhere, only down to Mr. Ashland's, and to meeting."</p> 
               <p>"Why not, child?"</p> 
               <p>"O, 'cause father burnt the Johnny-cake half up, this morning, trying to warm it; and he boiled my egg so hard I could n't do nothing with it, and-"</p> 
               <p>"There, there, child; don't tell any more, for I am tired almost to death, and I want you to go right in and rake open the fire, and boil the tea-kettle; so run back, Sammy, there's a dear child."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, mother," said the boy; and away he bounded, to do as he was bidden.</p> 
               <p>Prue stopped to gather a bunch of pennyroyal that bloomed against the wall, and soon after she entered her quiet home.</p> 
               <p>In the early part of the evening Edna came up from the ferry-house, accompanied by Lucy, to learn of Prue's success. The busy hum of the evening insects had ceased ere the girls left the cottage, so entertained were they by the recital of the kind and faithful negress. Prue said that day she had found out a good deal about folks' dispositions,-who thought most of this world, and who appeared to care but little for the next. But<pb n=""/> finally she felt pretty well satisfied, for she had had the promise of about twenty scholars, who were to assemble at the ferry-house.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland had readily coincided with Edna's plan, and had given orders for the crib-room to be fitted up immediately.</p> 
               <p>As the evening advanced, Richard walked up to the cottage to accompany the girls homeward. As they looked towards the bay, and saw the moonbeams glisten and dance on the water, the young man said to his companions, "I shall not view many more such scenes with you, for my home will soon be on the waves."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't go, Richard," said Edna, sadly; "for we should be very lonely without you."</p> 
               <p>"I must, Edna, for I have already stayed too long."</p> 
               <p>Lucy gave no utterance to her thoughts, for she dared not trust herself to speak. When they reached the door, after a gentle pressure to each girl's hand, and a low good-night, Richard went around to the porch, and, seating himself on the flat step, bent his gaze seaward.</p> 
               <p>Edna sought her pillow, but Lucy still lingered at the door, as if a weight hung heavy on her heart, which she would fain remove before she slept. At length she stepped lightly from the doorway, and with a gentle tread, crushing the wild-flowers in her pathway, she too sought the entrance of the back porch, where she hoped to find Richard, as she knew it was his favorite seat when in a musing mood. So light was the echo of her footfall, that Richard did not notice<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5991-00000133"/> that she was at his side until she bent, and, looking into his face, burst into tears.</p> 
               <p>"Lucy, my idol!" he said, "O! do not unman me, for I must leave here for your sake as well as mine! You would not-you must not become the wife of a beggar, and I am little else compared with you. No, dearest, I will not take advantage of your noble nature. I will prove my love by the sacrifice I make in not allowing you to become my penniless bride, to share my poverty and roaming life."</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish to wed now, Richard; but stay yet a little longer, and I feel that there will something transpire to convince my parents that you are worthy of their daughter."</p> 
               <p>"That were impossible as long as Nathan Fossett is sheltered by the same roof; for his low art and cunning deceit will foil every weapon that fights openly. It is plain your father thinks he can do no wrong; while a very slight thing might cast a shadow over my motives, and persuade him that all I do is to aggrandize self. I cannot blame your father that he does not want you to become the wife of a destitute adventurer, nor wonder that he favors Nathan; for he is a practical farmer, and to all appearance is wholly devoted to his interest. Believe me, Lucy, there will come a time when the mask will fall off, and your parents will discover his true character; but I cannot prove my thoughts, so I must away. When that time arrives let me know, and we may meet again."</p> 
               <p>"Until then, Richard?"</p> 
               <p>"Let me go, and seek to know if I have yet a relative this side of heaven."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O, not yet, Richard; stay with us but three months longer, and then, if nothing takes place to bring Nathan's true character to light, I will try no more to prevent your going, even though I were sure I should see you no more."</p> 
               <p>Lucy gazed into his face with a look so full of confidence that he pressed her closely to his heart, and said, "Should I refuse you, dearest, I should carry no sailor's heart. I promise, but it is for your sake only that I stay; for I know that my presence gives uneasiness to your father, although he is too kind-hearted to tell me to go."</p> 
               <p>"Remember your promise," said Lucy, rising from the rough stone step where she had seated herself by his side.</p> 
               <p>"I will," answered the young man; "for no <emph>true sailor</emph> ever breaks his word."</p> 
               <p>Lucy disappeared along the foot-path, and entered the house. As she departed, Richard felt as if a heavy load had been lifted from his heart; for his inclination was to remain at the ferry-house, though he thought it was his duty to go.</p> 
               <p>Richard and Lucy had forgotten that one window of Nathan's chamber overlooked the low seat where the lovers sat and so confidentially conversed. Although Nathan had long since retired to his room, he had not slept; and when he heard the sounds of the low voices beneath his open window, he noiselessly approached it, and listened to the conversation. He felt pleased to be thus assured that he was a favorite with the old ferryman and his wife, and several times he half arose from his chair to tell them so. But then his pride for-<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5991-00000134"/> bade, for he would not have them think him an eavesdropper; and, besides, he had now found out just how matters stood between Lucy and the young sailor, and he intended to make the most of it.</p> 
               <p>"Nathan's true character!" he muttered; and then continued, as he heard Richard close his chamber-door, "Your imagination serves you but poorly, for you know but little of Nathan Fossett's <emph>true</emph> character. So don't think to ensnare me within the next three months; for wiser heads than yours could not do it. But I swear, by my past success, that you, Richard Conworth,-or Arthur Sydenham, if you please,-shall not remain three months longer beneath this roof; for my <emph>clemency</emph> has lasted too long already towards one who is making Lucy my worst enemy. And do you think to find any kindred now, Sir Richard, where bright coin will be thrown into your purse? Allow me to say you are too late. There was a time when, if you had conducted yourself aright, and possessed <emph>my love,</emph> I might have assisted you; but I chose to act differently, and have never yet repented." Then, with dark thoughts mingling with his projects for the future, he went back to his bed, not to sink into quiet forgetfulness, but, when tired nature could endure no longer, to close his eyes and dream.</p>

               <p>A MONTH passed away, and Edna had been very successful with her school. All who had promised Prue that they would send their children had done as they agreed. And now, when the long noontimes came, it was a pleasant sight to see the light-hearted children sporting on the grass, and sending forth such joyous peals of laughter that the sounds echoed along the rocks, and often swept over the decks of vessels in the bay, carrying a home-thrill to the heart of the mariner as he passed the shore. Many came to see the school, and observe with what lover-like skill the fair preceptress gained the confidence of each child, and caused him to love his books and her. Sometimes, when the crib-room became too hot, she would gather her pupils beneath the old oak, and there, seating herself in their midst, instruct them in their appropriate lessons.</p> 
               <p>Afternoons, when the dinner-table was cleared, Lucy, who was now as cheerful as ever, would take a seat by Edna's side, and relieve her of half her labors. One<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5991-00000135"/> afternoon it was unusually pleasant; such a day as would conduce to good humor, nor allow those wearing a frown to call the weather its parent. Prue had, as she expressed it, tidied up her little house, and, after arranging tastefully on her head a gay-hued turban, and smoothing down the starched folds of her check apron, she put her knitting in her pocket, and sallied forth to spend the afternoon at Mr. Ashland's. As she looked down the hill and discerned the quiet group beneath the shade of the old oak, she climbed over the wall and bent low, that she might pass into the ferry-house unobserved.</p> 
               <p>"Good-day, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland," she said, pleasantly, as she came in from the porch, and went towards the window where the farmer's wife was sitting, listening to hear the children sing.</p> 
               <p>"Why, bless me!" she continued, "only think of it! Miss Edna's an't none of your common kind of schools! She larns them to sing, and to cipher, to write, and to knit, and how to be perlite, and all that. Well, I declare; I wonder how she ever came to know so much! But do hark and hear Sammy, poor child! He does love Frederick so; he says nobody dare call him names where Freddy Benton is."</p> 
               <p>"Everybody loves him that knows him," returned Mrs. Ashland, quietly, "for he is a good child."</p> 
               <p>"Bless his dear little heart! It does my eyes good to look at him. See, they have done singing now, and how kindly he offers one half of his book to Sammy, to read with him! I declare, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland, it does fairly amaze me to see how fast Sammy larns. Why, last night, he spelt out three or four verses in the Bible to<pb n=""/> my old man and me. I wished you could have seen Cudjoe laugh! If nothing happens, and the Lord spares his life, I think very likely he will be an elder, one of these days, and exhort round to evening meetings, and--"</p> 
               <p>"I hope he may," interrupted Mrs. Ashland; "but, Prue, he must be blest with something more than a knowledge of books to make his prayers and works acceptable in the sight of the Lord."</p> 
               <p>"That is very true, marm," answered the visitor, seeming now to realize how unwise had been her remarks in regard to her almost idolized boy; "but I pray every day for the Lord to give me strength and wisdom to bring Sammy up to be a Christian."</p> 
               <p>For a little while longer Mrs. Ashland and her guest conversed, and then they too went out under the tree to take a nearer view of the exercises of the children, Prue frequently manifesting her delight by half-suppressed exclamations. At length the simple and welcome sentence was pronounced, "Children, you may go." The subdued tones of their recitations gave place to merry sounds, and their quiet postures to frolicsome gambols, and in a few moments all dispersed to their respective homes.</p>

               <p>A FEW evenings later, when the members of the Ashland family had ended their daily toil, they were all congregated in the old square kitchen, after the evening meal. The group was not numerous; and yet their characters were so diverse that they would have furnished interest to a physiognomist, for the heart will, to a certain degree, be reflected on the face. In the old arm-chair at the window which overlooked the sea sat the venerable form of the ferryman. His hair was not wholly blanched, for among the long braids of his queue were intermingled the silvered and the black, as if to show the contrast. The poorest scholar in the study of the face might easily have read the noble mind of the head of that household band; for on each lineament was written, in plain characters, his firm reliance on the Word of God. On his knee sat Freddy, whose fast-developing form scarcely kept pace with his expanding thoughts; and with a childlike confidence he had sought his present position that he might ques-<pb n=""/> tion and enjoy learning from one who was ever ready to unravel intricate truths.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Ashland was there, with busy care, and all the fond devotion of a wife and mother, preparing for the comforts of her household.</p> 
               <p>Richard, too, was one of the group; and, though an open book was spread before him, his uneasy glances showed that his thoughts roved far away, as if in quest of his kindred.</p> 
               <p>Nathan sat leaning against the kitchen-jamb, where in winter the old dye-tub stood; a pleasant smile, that might easily deceive the unwary, was on his face. On the opposite side of the room, at the small round table, sat the beautiful Edna and Lucy, both engaged in embroidering some light articles designed for future use and ornament. When Mrs. Ashland had finished the work in which she was employed, she went to the little table, and, placing a hand on the head of each girl, said,</p> 
               <p>"Come, my children, don't work any more to-night; it will be better for you to go out under the tree and tell stories, and amuse yourselves a little while; the fresh air will do you good, as you are both pretty well confined during the day with the work and the school. So put your work right up, and, after you have talked a little while, you had better go to bed pretty early, as young folks need a good deal of sleep."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, mother," returned Lucy, tossing her work into a basket; and, playfully snatching Edna's, she made the same disposal of it. Then, tying a handker-chief around her head, as if to mimic Prue's turban, she passed out at the front door, followed by Edna.</p> 
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC5991-00000137"/> 
               <p>As Lucy passed Richard, a whispered "Come, too," reached his ear; and in a few moments he closed his book, and all three proceeded to the rural bench beneath the tree, and soon commenced singing some of the most popular songs of the times.</p> 
               <p>When several had been ended, "Edna," said Lucy, affectionately, "won't you sing us one of your own songs? I think them far more beautiful than anything I know, and your voice is so sweet! Would n't you like to hear her sing alone, Richard?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I should like to hear her sing something about the sea; for one would think the influence of this place might inspire poesy and song."</p> 
               <p>After a little more persuasion, Edna commenced, in low, sweet tones, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>Beneath the ocean's billow lies many a loved one's form,</l> 
                        <l>The tempest rages o'er them, and madly howls the storm;</l> 
                        <l>While we who live deplore them, and wish life's journey done,</l> 
                        <l>That we might reach the haven to which their souls are gone.</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>The invitation to Richard was not given in so faint a whisper but that it reached Nathan in the corner; but he appeared not to notice it. When Mrs. Ashland came over to the fireplace, and inquired why he did not go out and join the young folks, he answered, in a humble tone, that he feared he was not wanted.</p> 
               <p>"O, nonsense, child," said the kind-hearted woman; "of course you are as welcome as Richard to go out and sit under the old tree, and enjoy yourself in social chat. So go right along, Nathan, and help them sing; that is only a notion you have, thinking you're not wanted." And she handed him his straw hat, which<pb n=""/> was lying on the mantel, adding, "The way to have a body think a good deal of you is to think a good deal of yourself."</p> 
               <p>As Nathan took the hat, he smiled, and went out. He did not go directly to the tree, but stood under the lilac-bush beside the door until Edna had finished a verse of her original song. Then, advancing to the bench, and taking a seat by Edna's side, he whispered in her ear,</p> 
               <p>"How very appropriate! One who was possessed of a knowledge of some facts concerning the past might easily mistake it for an extemporaneous outlet to hidden grief."</p> 
               <p>The swiftest arrow from the archer's bow could not have silenced the voice of the young girl more quickly than did the words of Nathan, uttered in a low whisper. She did not answer-she did not move from her seat; but there was an involuntary shrinking of her form closer to Richard's side, as if she would seek protection ere another sentence fell from the lips of him who had just seated himself at the other side.</p> 
               <p>"O, do finish that song, sister!" said Lucy, unconscious that anything had been said to open the wound that time, with all its antidotes, had but partially healed.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot sing any more to-night, Lucy," said Edna, faintly.</p> 
               <p>"And why not, sister? Are you ill?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Lucy; but-but-"</p> 
               <p>"You had rather mourn for Charles Aylesbury!" again whispered Nathan, sarcastically, and placing his lips closer to her ear.</p> 
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5991-00000138"/> 
               <p>Edna involuntarily clasped one hand around the arm of Richard, while she held the other imploringly towards Lucy.</p> 
               <p>"O! O! I am ill!" she shrieked, half wildly. "Help me to my chamber!"</p> 
               <p>"This is strange!" said Lucy, springing to her side. "I never knew her to be taken ill so suddenly before!"</p> 
               <p>"Nor would she have been now, had that vampire by her side remained where we left him," said Richard, rising, and lifting her almost lifeless form from the rude bench. "I know not what he has said," he continued, "but I heard him whisper in her ear, and feel certain that his words contained venom."</p> 
               <p>"Liar!" muttered Nathan, between his teeth, in a guttural voice.</p> 
               <p>"That I don't chastise you now, reptile, thank these maidens!" said Richard, in low yet distinct tones, as he carried Edna towards the house.</p> 
               <p>During this brief scene fear kept Lucy silent, and grief and surprise rendered Edna nearly insensible. But, as Richard gained the threshold, his fair burden aroused from her stupor, and begged him and Lucy not to inform Mr. and Mrs. Ashland, as she felt better now, and, after a night's rest, would probably be quite well.</p> 
               <p>Lucy was very glad to acquiesce, as she feared that, if the affair were known, Nathan's version of it might lead to blame being attached to Richard; and, hastily bidding the young man good-night, she accompanied Edna to her chamber.</p> 
               <p>"Do you not wish me to stay with you to-night?"<pb n=""/> inquired Lucy, as she helped Edna to loosen her garments.</p> 
               <p>"No, Lucy. I want to sit here by the window a little while, and watch the waves as they come up. Did you never think there was healing to the mind in old ocean, when your heart was sad, and you felt weary?"</p> 
               <p>"I have, of late, sister; for it is only recently that I have known trouble."</p> 
               <p>"'T is seldom that we see a cloudless sky," returned the other; "or, if there be no clouds in sight, they soon come sweeping by, casting shadows over all."</p> 
               <p>"I know that Nathan said something to grieve you, Edna, although I did not hear him speak; but it is nothing strange that he should, for it is his nature. How great the contrast between him and Richard! And yet he has so imposed upon my father and mother by the pleasant face he carries in their presence, that it were impossible to convince them it is a counterfeit."</p> 
               <p>Edna was too sad to vent her feelings in words; so she made but a slight answer to Lucy's remarks, and soon she was left alone. When the chamber door was closed, Edna went to the bedside and leaned over the sleeping Freddy; for, when the girls went out to the rustic bench, he left a good-night kiss on the cheek of his benefactor, and hastened to his room.</p> 
               <p>"Poor, homeless boy!" she murmured; "I fear we shall soon be obliged again to roam."</p> 
               <p>And then she sank upon the bedside and mused. Where, and by what means, she asked herself, did Nathan become possessed of the fact that she loved<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC5991-00000139"/> Charles Aylesbury, and mourned his death? It was in vain her mental eye reviewed the past, to see if she had spoken to the traveller who tarried at the ferry-house the night previous to her taking up her abode at the Ashland homestead; for well she knew that by no word or token had she recognized him, save in the silence of her chamber. And thus her mind leaped from one conclusion to another, until the suspense could be endured no longer, and she firmly resolved to know the worst before another day had ended.</p> 
               <p>After again kissing the rosy cheeks of the slumbering boy, she seated herself by the window in the old arm-chair. Hours passed, and Edna did not leave the spot; but, when the pale light of the summer's early dawn began to streak the east, she thought she discerned a human figure upon the surf-beaten rocks. Looking forth with a steady gaze, she felt that she could not be mistaken in the form of the lonely watcher. It was Nathan, who sought to cool his fevered brain by the sea-breeze, and who had seated himself on the rocks to nurse his hate, and plan revenge.</p> 
               <p>At the sight of Nathan, and the remembrance of the words whispered in her ear, Edna's heart grew bold, and she determined to seek him there alone, and learn what he knew of her and the past.</p> 
               <p>"I never injured mortal," she exclaimed, "and why should I tremble at a word?"</p> 
               <p>With a quiet step she passed down the front stairway, and out of the door she had so feebly entered but a few hours previous.</p> 
               <p>"Nathan! Nathan!" she repeated, as she noiselessly<pb n=""/> climbed up the rugged sea-wall where the young man was half reclining.</p> 
               <p>"Is that you, Edna?" he inquired, rising to his feet, and standing as if an unwelcome visitor had intruded.</p> 
               <p>"It is; so sit down again at your ease,-you have naught to fear from me."</p> 
               <p>"Naught, did you say, my dear? Methinks you have forgotten those dark eyes of yours, that make all hearts captive, and have well-nigh driven me to distraction."</p> 
               <p>"I did not seek your side unbidden, at this unseasonable hour," said Edna, seriously, "to talk of love. I have come to know what is yet to me a secret. How came you to think that I loved Charles Aylesbury, or ever met with him until I saw him at the ferry-house? And why think you that I should feel any more interest in him than in any stranger who crosses this ferry?"</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Nathan, wildly. And then, seating himself by her side, he said, in a low tone, "Are there not some minds that can penetrate the heavens, and bring out hidden secrets from the stars?"</p> 
               <p>"That may be, Nathan; but I never gave you credit for such penetration."</p> 
               <p>"In human nature, Edna, I am deep. If love did not dwell in the recesses of your heart, why that sudden sickness, which nearly caused your death, when you heard of the fatal accident to him? And why did your song cease under the boughs of the old oak? And why has the rose fled, and left the lily on your cheek? Tell a tale yourself in every breath you<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5991-00000140"/> draw, and then ask me where I obtained the secret. But come, 't is folly to mourn for the dead, when we know that weeping cannot restore them. So, if your heart is made vacant by death, would it not be better to take a living form to fill it? The dead are but poor company for a pretty girl like you." And he gently drew nearer to her side, and attempted to take her hand; but, with a proud flash of the eye, she drew it back, and bade him leave a wide space between them.</p> 
               <p>A dark frown, which the coming daylight revealed, passed over Nathan's face. But Edna was no longer the timid girl of the previous evening; she met his dark gaze with a firm look, for she had expected to hear more than he had yet told her, and if this was all he knew she was happily disappointed.</p> 
               <p>"And is this all you know of my past history?" said Edna.</p> 
               <p>"If I know more, it is all I choose to tell at present; but by and by, when it suits my purpose, I have more to divulge, for I cannot always bear your scornful looks, and plainly-shown partiality for Richard."</p> 
               <p>"Nathan, you mistake me; I never scorned you. Alas! I know too well the sting it leaves in the goaded heart."</p> 
               <p>"Was it not scorn that made you leave me in silence, when I told you how much I loved you, and how happy would be the home I should provide, if you would become my wife?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Nathan, not scorn, but the language of a heart too full to relieve itself in words. My mind was carried back to the time when similar sentences,<pb n=""/> breathed by different lips, fell upon my ear, and I dared not trust myself to speak."</p> 
               <p>"It may be so, Edna; but I think it useless to mourn for the dead, and this night, as I watched you, while you were employed at the table, I vowed within myself to be trifled with no longer." And here Nathan stopped speaking, and looked cautiously around, to satisfy himself that no ear listened but that for which his words were intended, and then he continued, in a lower tone, "Richard shall leave the ferry-house, and that soon, without the prize he so eagerly seeks to win, though he takes cunning ways to prove to her his <emph>sincere love,</emph> and total disregard to her fortune."</p> 
               <p>"No, no, Nathan; you cannot mean this."</p> 
               <p>"I do; by Heaven, I swear it, that ere one month passes he shall be forced from the homestead forever! And that is not all; you shall be my wife, or go too. For years have I been trifled with; but I will be a boy no longer, and short will be the time that I give for you to decide, for I must have your answer now."</p> 
               <p>"You shall," said Edna, rising to her feet, and speaking decisively. "The mountain streams shall reverse the laws of nature and course upward, the hillside snows of winter shall assume the hues of your own black heart, and the zephyrs of evening be coined into that gold for which you would risk both soul and body, ere I become your wife! So trouble me no more. I did love Charles Aylesbury with all the devotion of a true woman's heart; and I love his memory still, and shall till life becomes extinct."</p> 
               <p>"Does your <emph>husband</emph> know of this monstrous love?" said Nathan, satirically; "and does he approve of it?<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5991-00000141"/> Ha! methinks you grow white, or else the dim light of the morning deceives me. Let me tell you, Mrs. Lizzie Lancaster, that no one insults Nathan Fossett with impunity! Is it right that a married woman should hold an interview in her chamber, at midnight, with a stranger? And should she steal her child, and forsake her home, to reside in foreign lands with another? And now, should you not love me out of gratitude, for keeping your secret so long, and because I am willing to overlook the past, and make an honorable wife of you still?"</p> 
               <p>"How can I become your <emph>honorable</emph> wife, if I have a husband now?" said Edna, striving to speak calmly, and repress the rising thoughts that almost over-whelmed her.</p> 
               <p>"That you had a husband I learned from your own lips, when you thought I was not near; but, whether he be dead or living now, I know not,-neither do I care, for, I confess, I am not over-scrupulous. But I believe I have been too hasty in my remarks for a cool, calculating lover; so, instead of receiving the answer you have given me as one from which there can be no retraction, I will extend my clemency, and if you give me a favorable reply within a week, it will do; but, if you persist in slighting my offer, I will keep your secrets no longer, but will expose to the Ashland family your love for Charles Aylesbury, and your concealment of it. Yes, and I will go further; for I know where you abode before you came to the ferry-house, and I will seek those who have a greater interest in you than the old ferryman or his household. So, beware! If you will become my<pb n=""/> wife, all shall go well; but, if not, you shall have a less comfortable home, within a month, although you may be surrounded by more wealth."</p> 
               <p>And, ere Edna could so far calm her mind as to speak again, he had sprung down the side of the rock, and was wending his way towards the back porch, beneath whose low roof he disappeared.</p> 
               <p>The smoke from the wide kitchen chimney began to curl upward, and still Edna sat crouched upon the rock where Nathan had left her. At one moment she was in mind as a timid child, and the next there came a change to the lion-hearted woman. She could think of no event that would add more misery to her life than to consent to become the partner of Nathan; and yet, if she left the protecting roof that had sheltered her in safety for almost three years, where could she go? The eyes of the inquisitive would be upon her, and she felt she had hardly courage to encounter their curious gaze. "Mrs. Ashland is kind, very kind," she murmured; "and when I told her of the past, she thought I revealed all of my former history, and she did not blame me for the step I had taken; but now, when a favorite of the family adds another chapter, and tells it in language to suit his purpose, I fear her strict sense of right will cause her to discard me. I might seek her side first, and tell her all; but that would avail me nothing, since he has made another threat, still more fatal to my happiness. No, there is nothing left for me now but to return thanks for past hospitality, and again throw myself on the charity of the world; so I will away and make preparations. And yet, it appears, if I could but fathom the mystery<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC5991-00000142"/> of how he became possessed of this knowledge, I could bear the sorrow of the present better." And then, gently drawing her hand across her brow, as if to clear away all traces of emotion, she proceeded towards the house, and entered the front door.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Edna dear," said Mrs. Ashland, as she stepped within the threshold, "you have been taking a very early walk. Is n't there too much dew on the grass and flowers for you to go out before the sun has dried the meadows?"</p> 
               <p>"O, no," returned Edna, at the same time averting her head, to conceal the starting tears; "I have not been far. You know I love to see the sun, as it rises, reflect upon the water; so I have been down to the rocks."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it is pleasant, child. When I was young, like you, I used to love to go down by the water, and watch the waves, and see the fish go by; but, as we get older, we don't mind so much about these things."</p> 
               <p>And Mrs. Ashland was so busy with her morning avocations, that she did not notice the traces of excitement that still lingered on Edna's face, as she thought how she would like to throw herself upon the neck of her benefactress, and unburden her surcharged heart; and yet, she felt such a course could do no good, for Nathan had threatened to seek others, and inform them where she was residing.</p> 
               <p>She therefore passed on to her chamber, and, divesting herself of her light shawl, went to the bedside, to see if Freddy were yet sleeping. His eyes were still closed, and his breathing so calm and peaceful, that Edna leaned over and kissed him, and smoothed back<pb n=""/> his clustering curls. He gave no sign that he felt the touch, save a short sigh, which was responded to by one longer drawn from the fair one bedside him. Then, turning away, she went to a trunk that stood beneath a window near the door, and selected a small portion of the most useful articles of their wearing apparel. Rolling them into a bundle, she crowded them into a travelling basket, and disposed about her person various little ornaments, which she had ever seemed to hold sacred. And now there remained a task to perform which seemed more painful than the rest; and, drawing a light-stand before the old arm-chair, she spread out a sheet of paper, and wrote, in hasty lines, words that ever and anon caused her tears to flow freely, and moisten the sheet on which she wrote. At length it was accomplished, and, folding the note, she placed it in a box which stood on the table; and, after bathing her face with the pure liquid from the old sweep-well, she hastened down stairs, to attend to her accustomed duties. At the breakfast-table she met Nathan, whose face, to a casual observer, seemed as calm as a summer's sea, but from whose varied expression, when he caught her eye, Edna read his guilty purpose, and she determined to thwart his designs.</p> 
               <p>The meal being over, and the early morning work finished, Edna asked Lucy if she were willing to teach the scholars until her return, as she wished to take Freddy and go over to Newport, and should be away during the day.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, certainly," answered Lucy; "and I think the sail will do you good, for you look pale, and<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC5991-00000143"/> perhaps you have confined yourself too closely; so give up all care to me, for I am sure that mother will be willing, and I shall take great pleasure in being a teacher."</p> 
               <p>"You will be very particular to instruct Sammy till I return, and let no one annoy him; for he has a kind and sensitive heart, although it beats beneath a colored skin."</p> 
               <p>"No one shall trouble Sammy when I am near; but why leave such precise directions, as if you were going a long journey, or possibly might never come back?"</p> 
               <p>"We cannot read the future, sister. When I leave this shore, it is but a plank that divides me from eternity. A sudden gust of wind, or the point of some hidden rock, might rob us of our slender foothold, and we should sink to rise no more."</p> 
               <p>"With an unskilful mariner at the helm, it might be so; but not when Richard guides the boat is such danger likely to overtake you."</p> 
               <p>"True, Lucy, I acknowledge I am paying but a poor compliment to your lover's skill. But let it pass. Suppose I should never return-would you be lonely without me?"</p> 
               <p>"Lonely, Edna? That is a strange question to ask one whose whole study is to be near you. But don't talk so any more, for you make me feel so sad, that I shall refuse to let you go, and will not teach the children to-day."</p> 
               <p>Edna smiled faintly, and, putting her arm around Lucy's neck, kissed her, and then went to Mrs. Ashland to speak of her departure."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to go over to town to-day, Mrs.<pb n=""/> Ashland," said Edna, her voice not betraying the emotion within.</p> 
               <p>The farmer's wife lifted her hand from the interior of the cheese-tub, and answered, with some surprise, "Why, child, it seems to me I would n't go to-day, for it is going to be very warm and uncomfortable by and by. I have just sent Prue out into the garden to get the sauce for dinner, because I thought it would be too hot to go out when the sun got up a little higher."</p> 
               <p>"O, I don't mind the heat, Mrs. Ashland, for I can seek the shade."</p> 
               <p>"And do you want to take Frederick with you, if you go?"</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," answered Edna, "I think he will be pleased to go, and he never lets the heat prevent his being out of doors when he is here."</p> 
               <p>"Well child, go, if you want to; but try to get back in good season, as there is to be a prayer-meeting up at neighbor Allen's this evening, and, if you don't get too tired, I suppose you and Lucy will like to go."</p> 
               <p>Edna turned away; she could not answer, for the mention of the social prayer-meeting among the neighbors awoke memories of the pleasant hours she had passed with these pious people, and there came a sickness at her heart now, as she thought she should visit them no more.</p> 
               <p>Freddy had arisen and gone to the corn-field with Mr. Ashland; so she returned to her chamber, and, after completing her preparations for the journey, went quietly out the front door to seek him.</p> 
               <p>"Do you want to go to town with me to-day, darling?"<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC5991-00000144"/> she said, as she crept through the wide space between the bars, and beckoned for him to come to her.</p> 
               <p>The boy left the tall corn-stalks, among which he was standing, and, as he came to her side, said, "I had just as lief stay with father Ashland." But, perceiving Edna's look of disappointment, he immediately told her he would like to go if she were going. "But first," he said, "let me go and kiss father, and bid him good-by, and tell him I will help him pull out the weeds around the corn to-morrow."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, darling, go back and bid him <emph>good-by,</emph>" said Edna, with a strange emphasis; "and I will go with you and bid him good-by too."</p> 
               <p>"Do," said the child; and they both, hand in hand, walked towards the spot where the still majestic form of the ferryman was half hidden among the waving corn.</p> 
               <p>"I am going to Newport to-day, father," said Frederick, reaching upward for a kiss.</p> 
               <p>"Are you, my dear?" said Mr. Ashland, stooping to give and receive the accustomed caress. Then, putting his hand in his pocket, he drew forth several pieces of coin, and handed them to the child, saying, "Well, be a good boy, and buy you a nice little book with that, to read to me when you come back."</p> 
               <p>Edna turned away, and wound around her taper fingers, half unconsciously, the silken corn-tassels; and when she was on the point of leaving the spot, and the good old man was again bending to his toil of extracting the weeds, she still lingered, as if wishing to say good-by, and depart sure of his love and kind feeling. She stepped back, and extended her hand, saying,<pb n=""/> "And won't you bid me good-by too?-I may be jealous of Freddy."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, dear, certainly," he said, drawing her nearer, and giving her a kiss on her snowy forehead, which Edna returned on his dark and sunburnt cheek. She looked so pale that Mr. Ashland gazed at her with more than common interest, telling her that he feared she applied herself too closely to her school; but she answered no, and then, again creeping through the bars, went back to the house. As Edna and Freddy disappeared, the old farmer resumed his labor, musing upon the scene that had just transpired, and thinking how lonesome he should be without that little child to play around him in his leisure hours, and to accompany him in the field.</p> 
               <p>After Edna had again looked over her wardrobe, and deposited the small amount of money she possessed in her pocket-book, she dressed Freddy in his best suit, and went to bid the other members of the family good-by. She did not wish to excite suspicion by appearing as if anything unusual were to take place; and yet she could not bear to leave them coldly, that they might accuse her of ingratitude when they learned she had gone forever. Winding her arm in a playful manner around Lucy's neck, she kissed her on each cheek, and the caress was sincerely returned. Then, going to the side of Mrs. Ashland, she did the same. The good lady afterwards said that she thought she felt a warm tear fall upon her cheek; but, as Edna left the room so quickly, she could not tell.</p> 
               <p>The family had not seen how well filled was Edna's travelling-basket, for as she passed into the large<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC5991-00000145"/> kitchen she left it without the door, and here it remained while she sought the low-fenced garden to say farewell to old Prue.</p> 
               <p>"Why, bless your dear soul, child," said the affectionate negress, "are you going to town this hot day? Why, you will roast!"</p> 
               <p>"O, no, I shan't, Aunty; I don't mind the heat. And I came to tell you I have got some clothes up in my trunk that Freddy wants to make Sammy a present of; and there are a few articles hanging in my chamber-closet that you may have for yourself. You need not take them to-day, but come down to-morrow afternoon and get them."</p> 
               <p>"Dear child!" said Prue, "I am sure I feel very thankful to you. And an't you got some mending or washing that you want me to do?"</p> 
               <p>"Not now, Prue; but, if I ever need a favor, I won't hesitate to ask it."</p> 
               <p>"That is right, child. Why, what are you doing, Sammy, with all the marigolds and saffron-blossoms?"</p> 
               <p>"I'm going to give them to Freddy to carry to town, 'cause he always likes posies."</p> 
               <p>"Well, well, what a child! I don't know what you would do without Freddy."</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, Prue," said Edna, extending her hand, her voice trembling, in spite of all her effort to appear calm.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, dear; but you look kind of sick, child. Had n't you better stay to home to-day, and wait till you feel real well before you go to town?"</p> 
               <p>Edna shook her head, and then went back to get her basket. Taking it in her hand, she walked slowly<pb n=""/> towards the water, while Freddy, after giving Prue an affectionate farewell kiss, followed, accompanied by Sammy, who did not leave him until he was seated on board of the Swallow.</p> 
               <p>As the boat glided out into deep water, Lucy, who was leaning against the well-curb, gayly kissed her hand to Edna, and Prue stretched up her tall figure in the garden, and waved hers, as if to say adieu.</p> 
               <p>Richard had no other passengers, for it was his first morning trip, and it was seldom that many were ready to cross the ferry at so early an hour. After some conversation about the affairs in the neighborhood, Richard spoke of the strange hate that Nathan bore him without a cause, and then diffidently inquired why the words he whispered affected her so much the evening previous.</p> 
               <p>Edna did not answer, but seemed intently engaged in watching a small boat that was bearing down towards them, wherein were two men.</p> 
               <p>"What are you looking at, Edna?" said Richard, glancing carelessly at the same boat, which appeared to be about a mile distant.</p> 
               <p>Still Edna did not speak, but pointed in the direction of the boat, and continued to gaze at it. As it came nearer, she asked Richard if he thought they intended to come alongside.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know," replied the young man, "but they have that appearance. Suppose I hail them, and find out what they want."</p> 
               <p>"O, do not notice them," said Edna, striving to appear unconcerned. But, as she observed they were<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC5991-00000146"/> nearing the sloop very fast, she begged him to crowd all sail, and land her, as quickly as possible, at Newport.</p> 
               <p>The other boat, which was a fast sailer, passed and repassed her bows, as if to cut her off, and ascertain who were her passengers; and then, coming alongside, but still a few yards distant, a young man of medium height arose at the stern of the boat, and requested Richard to let him get aboard.</p> 
               <p>"No, no! In Heaven's name, do not, Richard!" shrieked Edna, with all the wildness of despair; and then added, "If he is allowed within this boat, I will throw myself into the sea!" and, springing to her feet, she threw aside her light shawl and hat, as if preparing to make the fatal leap; but Richard drew her to his side, and, in quiet tones, bade her be seated, and he would refuse the stranger a passage.</p> 
               <p>"I wish for a seat in your sloop," again demanded the stranger, peremptorily, crowding his boat nearer.</p> 
               <p>"There is a lady on board who objects to my receiving any one now, and your own boat will carry you to the shore as safely as mine," answered Richard.</p> 
               <p>"Do you dare refuse me?" exclaimed the stranger. "Rather than to be defeated thus, you shall both die!" And he pointed a pistol at Edna, who threw herself upon the bottom of the boat, with a wild scream, while the ball went whizzing by, and sank harmlessly below the surface of the ocean.</p> 
               <p>"Wretch!" cried Richard, "who are you, that thus play pirate within hailing distance of the town?"</p> 
               <p>"My name is Edward Lancaster, and I but seek my own. This instant give me a seat by the side of my <emph>wife,</emph> in your boat, or you die!" And he rapidly<pb n=""/> reloaded the weapon, and aimed it at the head of the young sailor.</p> 
               <p>"Do your worst," said Richard; "for I have faced the cannon's mouth, when it was loaded by a steadier hand than yours. You cannot enter here without this lady's consent." And, with one hand on the helm, he bent towards Edna, and inquired if what he heard was true,-if the stranger were her husband.</p> 
               <p>"He is," said Edna, wildly; "but I swear, by the heavens above and the sea beneath, that I will never live with him another day, and the moment he steps over the taffrail I will plunge into the ocean grave that surrounds me."</p> 
               <p>"You cannot enter here, sir," said Richard, firmly, as, with a quick movement of the helm, he brought the boat before the wind, and sent her flying over the waters, seaward. The sun beat down with scorching power, but still the summer breeze filled the sails of each, and sent them rushing onward. But the race was not of long duration; for the hidden rocks beneath grated on the stranger's boat, while Richard swept by, avoiding the fatal peak that years of experience had made known to him. At the same moment Richard heard a splash in the water, and, looking back, he beheld the stranger, with arms uplifted, sink beneath the surface, from which he never rose again, buoyed by life.</p> 
               <p>Reader, we will not pause to speak of Edward Lancaster's history here, but pass on, for the present, and, ere we write Finis beneath these pages, you shall know why Edna had never told of her marriage, except to Mrs. Ashland, at the interview by the fireside, years gone by.</p> 
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC5991-00000147"/> 
               <p>"Were you acquainted with that stranger?" said Richard to the other occupant of the boat, as he drew him aboard the Swallow dripping from the water.</p> 
               <p>"No," returned the other; "I never saw him until this morning, when he came down to my boat, and offered me a good price, if I would take him to the Narraganset side. I told him that he could cross much cheaper in the ferry-boat; but, with an oath, he said he did not care a straw for cost; so I put off with him."</p> 
               <p>"And how came he to want to board us, when we were going in a different direction?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, as to that, you are as wise as I am. When we first espied you, he asked me what boat that was, and I told him it was Mr. Ashland's ferry-boat. He told me to bear down and let him see who that lady was on board. At first I refused; but I soon see that would n't do, for he told me, unless I was prepared to die, I had better obey his orders; and I am no great hand to fight, so I stayed at the helm and done just as he directed me. And, as for that rock, at any other time I could have cleared it just as well as you; but to see him so reckless of human life frightened me so that I believe I could hardly have told dry land from water."</p> 
               <p>During this time, Edna had arisen and thrown herself upon the side seat, while Freddy, on his knees, crouched near her, weeping bitterly; but no word was spoken by either, until the boat's prow was once more turned towards Newport; then Edna, pale and trembling, requested Richard not to disclose at the ferry-house that he had seen her husband.</p> 
               <p>The dripping passenger was too busy with his own thoughts to notice what was passing around him, for<pb n=""/> he had lost his all of this world's treasures, and was silently regretting that he had yielded to a stranger's caprice, for the few dollars he had received. Richard looked somewhat bewildered; for the quiet life that he had recently led at the ferry-house had partially unfitted him for stirring scenes, and the death-shriek and gurgle of the drowning man still rang in his ears; yet he forced himself to say, calmly,</p> 
               <p>"'T is strange, Edna, that you never told us that you were married; and still I do not wonder that you fled from him, for he must be a desperado, indeed, that prizes human life so lightly."</p> 
               <p>Edna did not weep, as she answered, sadly, "My life might have been taken, ere this, had I remained to be a victim to his cruel temper. I did not wish him dead, and yet I know that Heaven is just, and did but take one life to spare more."</p> 
               <p>Before they reached the land, Richard promised he would say as little as possible about the affair, and would not be the first to tell that the drowned man was her husband.</p> 
               <p>When the owner of the lost boat stepped upon the wharf, there was a general inquiry as to his appearing in such a plight; but all the satisfaction that the public obtained was, that he had accidentally run upon a rock and wrecked his boat,-for which he seemed to feel worse than for the loss of the passenger,-and that a man, who was with him, fell overboard and was drowned, and that Richard had rescued him from the sinking boat.</p> 
               <p>"Good-by, Richard," said Edna, sadly, as they stood<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC5991-00000148"/> a little apart from the crowd. "I thank you for all the kindness I have received from you."</p> 
               <p>"What mean you, Edna? One would think you were never going to return to the homestead again."</p> 
               <p>"He would think rightly, too; I shall return to the farm-house no more."</p> 
               <p>"No more, Edna? You cannot mean it!"</p> 
               <p>"I do, Richard; I have spent my last night there. The same roof can no longer shelter Nathan and me. And, Richard-" for a moment she hesitated, and then added, in a lower tone, "beware of him, Richard, for he has sworn that you shall not remain there another month, and that Lucy shall never become your wife."</p> 
               <p>Richard compressed his lips for an instant, and then asked, "Does Mr. Ashland's family know that you have left them?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Richard; for I had not the courage to tell them. I did not think of going till this morning."</p> 
               <p>And then, leading Freddy by the hand, they walked up the street a little way together, and Edna told him of the interview she had that morning held with Nathan on the rock, and also of Charles Aylesbury. She had not intended to allude to him when she first began to talk in confidence; but one by one her thoughts were spoken, until it was too late to recede, and it seemed a solace to tell to one honorable heart the weight of woe that oppressed her.</p> 
               <p>"And where do you intend to go now?" said Richard, when she had ceased speaking.</p> 
               <p>"I know not," said Edna, despondingly; "perhaps I may go to New York, and seek employment among strangers."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"O, I would not, Edna. Return with me, and explain all to Mr. and Mrs. Ashland, and I will add the events of to-day, and they will overlook the past seeming deception."</p> 
               <p>"No, Richard; Nathan has too strong a hold there for you or me to clear away the mist that keeps his baser character unseen."</p> 
               <p>"Poor Lucy!" said Richard, with a sigh. "I would, for your sake, like to stay the appointed time, and yet it is almost past endurance to glide smoothly over so much misery."</p> 
               <p>They talked on until the crowd began to disperse, and then the young man stooped and kissed the cheek of Freddy, who could not seem to comprehend anything, except that he was not to return to the ferry-house, and wept bitterly at the disappointment; but, noticing how pale and sad Edna looked, he endeavored to dry his tears, and assured her he was willing to go wherever she wished.</p> 
               <p>When Richard had gone back to the boat, Edna walked on with Freddy, she scarcely knew whither, for she was a comparative stranger in the town. At length she stepped aside from the public street, and, seating herself on a low rock by the wayside, mused which were the best direction for her to take. Several persons passed by; some bowed slightly, and others did not seem to notice that she was there. At length there came near a woman, a little beyond the prime of life, who stopped a moment on the opposite side of the lane, and then crossed to where Edna was sitting, with Freddy's head resting in her lap. "You have a very warm seat, my dear, on that rock," she<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC5991-00000149"/> said, with a kind smile on her lips; "won't you get up and go into my house, up the lane, here, until you get rested?"</p> 
               <p>"Do," said Frederick, drawing his hand across his temples; "for my head aches, and I feel so bad!"</p> 
               <p>Edna arose, listlessly, but in a moment there came the thought how much depended on her energy, and how helpless was the tender child by her side; so, with that violent effort that the naturally timid sometimes make, she spoke cheerfully, stating that she should like to get a respectable but cheap boarding-place, for a short time, for herself and Freddy.</p> 
               <p>"Well, we will talk that over by and by, dear, when we get into the house. I will show you the door, and then I will run right down to my brother's shop, where I was going when I saw you, and see if my old man got a mess of fish this morning; for it is getting rather late, and when men are busy they don't think much about dinner until it is time to commence eating, and then they think you can cook a good dish in a minute."</p> 
               <p>The woman smiled as if she would like to draw a response from Edna, and then pointed to a small but comfortable-looking house, telling her to enter and ask her daughter Patience to take her things, and give the child a cup of milk, and she would be back presently. Edna thanked her, and, going up the foot-path, rapped at the door.</p> 
               <p>"Come in," said a sweet voice; and Edna, gently opening the door, saw a beautiful dark-eyed girl busily employed in embroidering a pair of slippers, and at the same time teaching the art to one several years her junior. As Edna entered the elder of the two bowed<pb n=""/> and pointed to a chair, while the other arose to await the orders of the new-comers. Edna, in an easy manner, delivered the message which had been sent by her to the daughter, and then took the proffered chair, and seated Frederick on her knee.</p> 
               <p>"I shall have to put by my work now, Monieda," said the younger of the two, "and make preparations for dinner."</p> 
               <p>"Well, perhaps it will be as well, Patience, as too long practice will be apt to injure your eyes," replied the other; "and, besides, it is near the hour that I have to call at Mrs. Henley's to give her daughter a lesson in drawing."</p> 
               <p>"So it is," answered Patience, gathering up the fragments of floss silk and crewel, while Monieda arose, tied on a light straw hat, and, bowing respectfully to Edna, went out.</p> 
               <p>For several moments the musical voice of Monieda echoed on Edna's ear, and she inquired of Patience who the young girl was that had just left.</p> 
               <p>"O, that is Monieda, the daughter of the old Indian squaw Wenoma, and we all love her dearly,-she is so good to her mother, and so kind to everybody else!"</p> 
               <p>"Where does she live?" said Edna, seeming reluctant to let the subject drop.</p> 
               <p>"Well, she lives up on the knoll, in father's old house. She has lived there two or three years, and you don't know what a beautiful place she has made of it. The little garden, where the weeds used to grow, is now all full of flowers and vegetables, and the house looks as neat as wax-work. They do live there so happy, it<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC5991-00000150"/> would do you good to see them at evening, when Monieda gets home from teaching, and sits down by the side of her mother, and tells her all about what she has seen and heard through the day."</p> 
               <p>"Does she teach anything besides embroidery?" inquired Edna.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes, she is capable of teaching everything, I believe; and, besides, she does a good deal of nice sewing for the quality, and they pay her high prices on account of her being so good to her mother. O! you would love to be acquainted with her,-she is so good! Father said she should n't pay any money for the rent of the house this year; and so she is teaching Esther and me embroidery, and how to paint pictures too."</p> 
               <p>Edna would have made more inquiries concerning Monieda, but at this moment she heard the footsteps of the mother at the door. Mrs. Watkins, whom the reader will recognize as the wife of the owner of the little cottage on the knoll that was hired by Nathan, entered with a basket containing a number of fresh fish that had but recently left their ocean homes.</p> 
               <p>"You found the way," said she, nodding pleasantly to Edna.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," answered Edna, "but I will not intrude on your hospitality. As you are probably better acquainted in Newport than I am, will you be so kind as to tell me of some respectable family where I can get boarded for a few weeks?"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps you are the wife of some of our captains, come over from some of the back towns to meet your husband when he arrives," interrupted Mrs. Watkins;<pb n=""/> and then continued, without appearing to notice what Edna had said, "I declare that is a nice little boy; but you look very young to have such a large child. How old is he?"</p> 
               <p>Edna gave the required answer, and then repeated her request.</p> 
               <p>"O, yes," said Mrs. Watkins; "I can get you a boarding-place; perhaps my old man will be willing that I should board you. There might somebody sleep in the spare chamber as well as not; so make yourself contented and stay to dinner, and when that is over I will ask him about it. I never like to take a stranger into my family without his consent; because, you see, if anything should happen wrong, why, he might think more than he 'd say. Not that I think but what you are a good young woman." And thus she rattled on, with an occasional glance into her guest's face.</p> 
               <p>Edna felt sad and embarrassed; but yet, so rapid and continuous were her hostess' questions, that they needed few answers. At length, aided by her two industrious daughters, the sailor's wife provided a sumptuous meal after the fashion of the times. As the husband was heard approaching, Mrs. Watkins asked Edna what she should call her name.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Lancaster," she replied.</p> 
               <p>Freddy looked up as if surprised at her answer, but a sign from Edna kept him silent, and Mrs. Watkins introduced her to her husband, who bowed, saying, "How do you do, ma'am?" and then all took seats at the table.</p> 
               <p>"There has been a terrible accident out here, not<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC5991-00000151"/> far from the Dumplings," said Mr. Watkins, glancing at Edna.</p> 
               <p>"Why, you don't say so!" replied the wife.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Patience, a dreadful accident. Luke Slater has lost his boat, and a man fell overboard and was drowned."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear!" said Mrs. Watkins; "that shows that we should be always ready. But do tell me all about it, James."</p> 
               <p>"Well, all I know I can tell in a very few minutes. After I caught the fish, I put them in Lyman's shop, so as to be ready for you when you came along, and then I went down to the ferry-wharf. I saw a crowd collecting there, and when I went to see what was the matter, they told me that the ferry-boat put off with two passengers,-a woman who was running away from her husband, with her little boy. They had had some trouble some way, and he had been over here to find her; but he could n't, so he hired Luke to take him back again to the Narraganset side. Well, when they were about half-way over, they saw her coming in the ferry-boat; so he told Luke to run alongside, for he wanted to get into the Swallow. And then I could n't seem to find out anything very particular; only, when Luke was trying to sail up close to the ferry-boat, he run afoul of a rock, and this stranger-I did n't learn his name-was drowned, and the boat was all stove to pieces; and the young skipper of the Swallow picked up Luke, and brought him safe to land."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear! what a dreadful thing!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it was a dreadful thing, to be sure," said the husband, every now and then looking at their guest.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Edna endeavored to appear calm, but the food lay untasted in her plate, and every word that the sailor spoke went like a dagger to her heart. The unsuspicious wife attributed her pallor and want of appetite to fatigue and sympathy for the drowned; and when the meal was ended she went to her husband's side, and whispered in his ear that she should like to take that young woman to board, if he had no objection. He gravely shook his head, and beckoned for her to go into another room.</p> 
               <p>When they were in the great room, they commenced talking in an under tone respecting their guest.</p> 
               <p>"Patience," said the husband, "why is it that you will be so familiar with every one that comes along, before you know anything of them, or their characters? By and by you may be sorry that you were not a little more particular, when you have brought those into the house who may corrupt our children."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what do you mean, James?" she said. "Is there anything wrong about this young woman? I am sure that she appears innocent and pretty. She says she is waiting for her husband's ship to get in from sea."</p> 
               <p>"Did she say that, Patience?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, no, she did not say that exactly, either; but I said it, and she did not deny it."</p> 
               <p>The husband smiled at his wife's simplicity, and then continued, "I have seen that young woman to-day before; I saw her leaving the Swallow when I first went down there."</p> 
               <p>"For mercy's sake, husband!"</p> 
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC5991-00000152"/> 
               <p>"Yes, it is the truth; and I tell you, Patience, that was her husband who was drowned."</p> 
               <p>"O, dear! what a dreadful woman she must be not to say a word about it when we were talking! I declare, who'd a thought it? Well, if that is the case, she must leave immediately." And the husband and wife parted-he to seek his vessel, and she to afflict anew her guest.</p> 
               <p>"My husband says I can't board you, ma'am," said Mrs. Watkins, seemingly unconscious how deeply her words pierced, and merely desirous to communicate her thoughts in a straightforward way. "He says he guesses that it was your husband that was drowned, and the least you could have done was to own it."</p> 
               <p>Edna was weary, faint, and dejected, almost penniless, and quite homeless. Ever since the preceding evening her nerves had been tasked to the utmost, and now nature could endure no longer. Scarcely had the last words fallen from the lips of the hostess, ere Edna's head sank upon her bosom, and, clasping Freddy in her embrace, she fell upon the floor, insensible to her own sorrows, and the consternation that surrounded her.</p> 
               <p>"Monieda, Monieda!" shrieked the eldest daughter, as she saw the Indian maiden passing, "do come in and help us!"</p> 
               <p>When all was explained, and Edna restored to consciousness, "Take your child and come with me," said the noble-hearted girl; "there is room in our cabin for you both. Wenoma and Monieda pity the unhappy, and would gladly heal the wounded."</p> 
               <p>Edna looked at the young girl with a glance so full of gratitude that Monieda felt repaid for all the sacrifice she would have to make in providing her and Fred-<pb n=""/> erick with a temporary home. In vain did the sailor's wife try to dissuade her from her benevolent purpose; her only answer was, "I pity the unhappy, and she will be welcome at our cabin;" and then, passing Edna's hand within her own arm, they went out, accompanied by the child, and took their way to the cottage on the knoll.</p> 
               <p>At first, Mrs. Watkins felt rather chagrined to be outdone in hospitality, but she soon consoled herself by the thought that she might have stayed there if she had only been more communicative. But when Monieda arrived at her pleasant though humble home, neither mother nor daughter inquired whether Edna were deserving or not. She had said that she was without shelter or friends, and this was enough to enlist the kind hearts of Wenoma and Monieda.</p>

               <p>THE small green islands in the distance, that sat on the bosom of the glistening bay like so many emeralds framed in glass, shut out the view of the morning's encounter; and when Richard returned to the ferry-house he kept his thoughts within his own breast, as he had been requested. Ere the sun went down, the report reached the homestead that a man was drowned in the bay that morning, and that Richard had rescued his surviving companion; but the full particulars were not learned till long after.</p> 
               <p>As the day began to draw to a close, Lucy would go down to the shore to inquire for Edna each time that the ferry-boat was seen approaching, until, at length, the laborers came in from the field, and then there was a general demand for Frederick; but his merry voice came not to greet them. When the supper-table was spread, and Mr. Ashland took his<pb n=""/> accustomed seat, he looked anxiously at the little high chair standing in the corner of the room, but said nothing; and when the meal was concluded, and he returned thanks to the Giver of all blessings, a petition was offered for the absent, and a half-uttered wish for their safe return. Then, as the family dispersed to their wonted duties or enjoyments, Mr. Ashland went down to the water's side and looked over towards the town. The last boat was just coming in for the night, and the old man took his glasses from his pocket, and, putting them on, carefully looked to see who were the passengers; but when the last one touched the land, he turned away, and, crossing his hands behind him, walked slowly up to the house, and took his favorite seat by the window that overlooked the bay. When the pewter plates and porringers were once more washed and put in their accustomed places, Mrs. Ashland went to her husband's side, and inquired, in a low tone, lest she should be overheard by Lucy, who stood leaning against the mantel, what he thought was the reason that Edna and Freddy had not come.</p> 
               <p>"I know of no reason," replied the ferryman, slowly; "but this morning, when he put his little arms around my neck in the corn-field and kissed me, a strange fear came over me that I should never see them again." And the sunburnt old man drew from his deep pocket his large cotton handkerchief, and dried the tears that arose in spite of his effort to restrain them.</p> 
               <p>"I don't know that I ever did anything to Edna to make her offended," said Mrs. Ashland; "for I have always tried to make her comfortable, and she has always been such a good girl that we could n't help<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC5991-00000154"/> loving her, and dear little Freddy, too. Poor things! What will become of them?"</p> 
               <p>"It is nothing that we have done, wife, that has made them leave us. But I think she may have heard something about her absent friends, and she could not bear to tell us that she must go, and take the child away; for she knew how much we set by him."</p> 
               <p>"Well, it may be so, John; but I rather think she got belated, and will come back in the morning."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so," said Mr. Ashland, shaking his head sadly. "But I remember now how pale she looked this morning, and how earnestly she bade me good-by at parting." The ferryman bowed his head upon his hand, and said no more until Lucy came up, and, putting her arm around his neck, kissed him and sobbed bitterly, and then related Edna's conversation with her in the morning, and told her father that she had requested her to teach the school until her return.</p> 
               <p>"Which I fear will never be," interrupted Mr. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"Go, Lucy," said her mother, "and see if she took many of her clothes with her, and ask Richard how she appeared on the boat, and if she said anything to lead him to think she would never return; and if he suspects where she is gone."</p> 
               <p>Among the group no one seemed more astonished to think that Edna had left the ferry-house than Nathan. He walked the room in agitation, when Lucy, on returning from the chamber, informed them that she had taken a great part of her wardrobe. He inquired of Mr. Ashland if it were not best that he should take one of the boats and go over to town in quest of her. "For,"<pb n=""/> said he, "if she is in town I can find her; as there is not a spot in the whole place that I did not travel over while my mother lived there." And then he added, almost inaudibly, with a well-feigned sigh, "But she is gone now. One year has passed since I stood beside her new-made grave."</p> 
               <p>"O, no; I guess not, Nathan," answered the old man. "If it is her wish to leave us, perhaps it is better that she should go. I fear I was wrong to allow myself to become so attached to a stranger and her child."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose you should find her unworthy of your affection?" said Nathan, timidly, as if afraid his words might not be well received.</p> 
               <p>"Edna was not unworthy," said Richard, firmly, and giving Nathan a look that would make a craven spirit tremble.</p> 
               <p>"I don't say that she was," said Nathan, in the same pleasant tone; "but it looks strange that she should so abruptly leave a family where she had been treated so kindly, and let no one know of her whereabouts."</p> 
               <p>"It does look strange," said Mrs. Ashland, musingly; "and yet, I-I can't think that Edna would do wrong."</p> 
               <p>"She would not, Nathan," said Lucy, coming to her mother's side. "Should we not have confidence in Edna, when she has been with us almost three years, and her conduct has been faultless? And how tender and affectionate was she this morning when she left! Such hints are bred in your own foul mind, Nathan Fossett; and if father and mother had as little love for you as I have, this roof should not shelter you another hour!"</p> 
               <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC5991-00000155"/> 
               <p>"Lucy, Lucy, child! you should not speak so to any one in your father's house," said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"If it were Richard," said Nathan, meekly, "that thus plainly spoke out his thoughts, Lucy would not have treated him so harshly; but I cannot expect justice when he is near."</p> 
               <p>"Justice!" repeated Richard, ironically. "No, you cannot expect <emph>justice</emph> until your black heart is purified. Why don't you speak out your thoughts freely, and tell the reason why Edna left? For you know better than any one present."</p> 
               <p>"'T is false! I know nothing about it; but there is one thing I do know." And, turning to Mr. Ashland, Nathan said, "Unless you wish your daughter to wed a penniless adventurer, beware of Richard Conworth! For I do know that within a few weeks, even at the midnight hour, they sat together and talked of love and marriage; and Richard laid plans to drive me from beneath this roof, because I would do my duty in trying to prevent a marriage I knew you would not sanction, and save Lucy from the misery that awaits her if she, in a moment of infatuation, should become his wife."</p> 
               <p>"Liar!" exclaimed Richard, springing towards Nathan. But he instantly controlled his anger, and, endeavoring to speak with composure, turned towards Mr. and Mrs. Ashland, saying, "That I love Lucy as well as my own soul, I will not deny; and that I remained here so long because she was here, is equally true. But Heaven will bear me witness that I never asked her to leave her home as my wife until I should have a comfortable one to carry her to."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>This scene had been rapidly enacted, and as yet Mr. Ashland had not spoken. But now he arose, and, taking Richard's hand, said,</p> 
               <p>"Richard, you have been in my employ a long time, and during those years you have been industrious and faithful; but I did not think you were seeking to gain the affections of my only child. However, we cannot recall the past, but let us amend in the future. I do not wish my daughter to marry at present; and, if ever the time should come that she should wed, I hope it may be with one whom she has known from childhood up."</p> 
               <p>"O, blame him not, father!" said Lucy, going to Mr. Ashland's side, and twining her arms around his neck. "Richard has spoken the truth, and I now acknowledge that I loved him before he had spoken the word to me, nor shall I cease to love him while I possess my reason. And I firmly believe, father, that the time is not very distant when you will have a different opinion of Nathan from what you hold now."</p> 
               <p>"I seek to hide no act of my life," said Nathan, with an injured air. "If I have done aught amiss, I have erred unintentionally, and freely ask forgiveness of you all."</p> 
               <p>"We can but believe you, Nathan," said the ferryman and his wife, in a breath.</p> 
               <p>"We have never proved you false to our interest in anything yet," continued Mr. Ashland; "and, as you have been here longer than Richard, and as one must leave us, to prevent the recurrence of such a scene-"</p> 
               <p>"I do not wish to remain longer," interrupted Richard. "No, Lucy, even the love I bear you could not<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC5991-00000156"/> keep me here now. Nathan shall be gratified; too long have I stayed already."</p> 
               <p>And, before any one could reply, Richard had gone to his chamber, and closed the door.</p> 
               <p>Lucy still clung to her father's neck, begging him to persuade the young sailor to remain; but both parents were resolute in their purpose. Finding her entreaties vain, she stole quietly away, and sought her own room to weep alone. She felt that she was about to be doubly bereaved. Edna and Freddy had fled, and in a few short hours Richard would go too, and, perhaps, their parting would last forever.</p> 
               <p>Midnight had arrived, when Richard was aroused from his troubled sleep on the low couch where he had thrown himself, undivested of his clothes, by a light rap at the door of his chamber. The moon shone brightly, revealing every object as plainly as if the light of day had entered through the open window; and, on opening the door, he beheld Nathan, who stepped within unbidden. Richard's first impulse was to tell him to begone; but, ere his thoughts were executed, the young farmer spoke in the same quiet tones he was ever wont to use, saying he had a secret to impart, if Richard would promise to make no loud remarks, that might awaken any of the members of the Ashland family.</p> 
               <p>Richard thought that he should have but little faith in anything that Nathan could say; yet he felt a curiosity to learn his thoughts, so he promised what the intruder required. After seating himself at the open window, Nathan began:</p> 
               <p>"I think, Richard, that I have heard you say, in the<pb n=""/> presence of the family, that you could remember nothing of your parents; but you have never told them any other particulars concerning your history."</p> 
               <p>"I never have," said Richard, coldly. And then he added, "I have never said more to any one except Lucy. But what has that to do with the secret? If you have anything to say, speak quickly, and then leave me, for I would rather be alone."</p> 
               <p>Nathan looked around, to be certain that the door was closed, and then continued,</p> 
               <p>"I know you never have, and yet I know more of your history than any one else; I will not even except yourself."</p> 
               <p>Richard smiled sarcastically, and then inquired where were his proofs.</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you," replied Nathan. "Were you not washed upon the shore from a wreck on the English coast, and taken from thence by a fisherman, who carried you to his hut, where you remained until you were old enough to go to sea?"</p> 
               <p>"All this is true," said Richard, "and yet I cannot think how you obtained the information; for I have never spoken of these facts to any one save Lucy, and I do not believe that she would betray me."</p> 
               <p>"She did not; but I have seen your father, and talked with him. From him I learned these particulars."</p> 
               <p>"How came he possessed of this information?" asked the young sailor, hurriedly.</p> 
               <p>"He had seen the fisherman and his wife, and ascertained from them that you were still living; and so he<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC5991-00000157"/> pursued you from place to place, till, about two years and a half ago, I met with him at Newport."</p> 
               <p>"Surely, Nathan, you cannot mean what you say!" said Richard, grasping him by the arm. "If this were true, you would have told me of it before."</p> 
               <p>"Not I," said Nathan, with a low laugh. "Nor would I tell you of it now, only that I think it impossible for you to find him."</p> 
               <p>"O, Nathan! this is the most unkind deed of all. But take me to my father, or tell me where I may find him, and I will forgive all the past, and will ever be one of your warmest friends in the future."</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Nathan. "Words are easily spoken-they cost nothing."</p> 
               <p>"Nathan! Nathan!" again exclaimed Richard, seizing his hand. "O! do not mock me! But, if your words be true, tell me all you know of my father. His name,-where I may find him, and whether he be poor,-all, all-tell me, Nathan, and, as God is my witness, I will overlook the past, and prove myself your devoted friend."</p> 
               <p>"And will you consent to give up Lucy forever?-Never seek her more, be you rich or poor?"</p> 
               <p>Richard was silent a moment, and then answered,</p> 
               <p>"Ask anything else of me, Nathan, and I will grant it; but, if I ever become possessed of wealth, Lucy must share it with me, or it would be useless."</p> 
               <p>"Then live on in poverty!" returned the other; "for I will never assist to place you where you may stand a chance of becoming the husband of Lucy. So, in regard to your first question,-his <emph>name</emph> you will learn when you see him; and then, as to where you<pb n=""/> will find him, I can only answer probably at home, if you are so fortunate as to find his home. He was so rich that he gave me fifty pounds to bring you to him, which I promised to do; but, after I got out into the fresh air, I altered my mind, and concluded to appropriate the money to other purposes."</p> 
               <p>Nathan gave a low laugh as he witnessed the expression of intense anxiety on the sailor's face, and then whispered,</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Richard; he was rich,-very rich. But I shall tell you no more."</p> 
               <p>He arose to go; but Richard grasped his hand, and in almost frenzied tones begged Nathan to tell where he had seen his father, that he might seek even the house where he had been.</p> 
               <p>"Where is all your pride now," said Nathan, in an ironical tone, "that you sue so humbly to me? I have told you on what terms I will say more; and, unless you acquiesce in them, you need ask me nothing further."</p> 
               <p>"Stay!" said Richard. "Will money tempt you to tell me where, or at what house, he stopped while at Newport?"</p> 
               <p>Nathan hesitated a moment, and then went back to the chair; for his avarice was aroused, and he desired the gold.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said he, "I will tell you where he stayed, if you will give me a sufficient sum."</p> 
               <p>"Take that, then," said the other, crossing the room, and getting from the till of his sea-chest a leathern bag, from which he extracted a handful of notes and coin, and passed them to Nathan. "Now tell me<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC5991-00000158"/> the truth," he said, "for I swear, by my hope of Heaven, that, if you speak falsely, I will return here, and your life shall pay the forfeit; for I am growing desperate, and not much longer can I endure to roam the world in search of a phantom."</p> 
               <p>"He stayed at the Stranger's Home, in Newport," replied Nathan; "but I shall tell you no more."</p> 
               <p>"Suppose I should expose what you have told me to-night?" said Richard.</p> 
               <p>"I have thought of that, and came when no one would witness our interview; and, as for your word, it will stand no better than mine here. I should deny having seen you since we parted in the evening."</p> 
               <p>And, before Richard could speak again, Nathan had left the chamber, and cautiously closed the door.</p> 
               <p>When the young sailor was once more alone, he sat by the window and meditated on the strange events that had transpired during the last twenty-four hours, and thought how hard would be the parting between him and Lucy, and then he determined to leave before she awoke in the morning. He relighted the candle that stood upon his table, and hastily penned a note bidding her good-by, and stating that his heart would ever be hers in whatever circumstances he might be placed; and if fortune ever favored him so that he could exalt her to that sphere for which he felt nature had endowed her, he should return and claim her for his bride. Then, sealing the note, he walked cautiously along the narrow entry that led to Lucy's room, and, quietly pushing back the door a small space, dropped his farewell token on the floor, and went back to his own chamber to make preparations for his departure.<pb n=""/> His wardrobe was small, and in this instance it proved very convenient that it was so; for, after dressing himself in his holiday suit, his small sea-chest held the remainder. He was soon ready; and, after encasing his feet in light shoes, crept down the back way with his chest on his shoulder, and went down to the water's edge. Towards the Swallow he looked with almost tearful eyes, for there were pleasant memories associated with her; and, drawing nearer, he muttered, in half-audible tones, as if talking to a thing of life,</p> 
               <p>"Give me one more safe sail, shipmate, and then I will trouble you no more."</p> 
               <p>Then, throwing his hat on the pier, he turned, with uncovered head, to take a farewell look at the house where he had spent so many happy hours, and once more to gaze at the window of Lucy's chamber. As the full moon shone brightly on the old ferry-house and its surroundings, the place appeared to the mind of the young sailor almost like a fairy spot. There stood the rude bench under the green oak-tree near the front door, and beyond the clover-field the walnut-grove looked fresh and beautiful. In the distance he heard the everlasting surge beating against the rocks, that seemed as sentinels to guard the land. Long did Richard stand and view the scene; but, as he looked upward for the last time to the well-known window, his heart misgave him to leave without once more seeing Lucy, and assuring her of his love. "And yet," he argued with himself, "if I see her again, we must still part, and what I have written will convince her of my affection; so I will linger no longer, but will go and solve this mystery concerning<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC5991-00000159"/> my father. If Nathan has spoken truly, I have but to learn his name at the Stranger's Home; and then, if this wide world contains my parent, I will find him." Thus saying, he unwound the hawser that made fast the sloop, and then sprang over her side to push off.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan left Richard's room he went noiselessly back to his own chamber; but his brain was too active to permit him to sleep, and, seating himself by his window, he listened to Richard's movements. As he heard the young sailor steal along the entry, he sprang lightly to his chamber door, which stood ajar, and by the light of the moon he discovered the billet which Richard had designed should greet Lucy's eyes on her awaking in the morning. No sooner was it deposited, and Richard again in his room, than Nathan reached within the crevice of the door, and appropriated the note to himself; then, returning to his window, he read the contents, and became aware that the young man intended to depart immediately, and he resolved to watch his footsteps, to see what direction he would take. Nor did he stir from the window until he saw Richard about to loosen the hawser; then he too crept quietly down, and, going to the water's side, offered to conduct Richard across, and return with the boat.</p> 
               <p>"I was intending," said the sailor, coldly, "to have it returned early in the morning by a friend; but, if you wish it, it will do as well for you to sail over." And Richard seated himself at the helm as usual, and guided the Swallow safely across the bay.</p> 
               <p>In the passage each was silent, for Nathan's guilty soul was exulting over the departure of Richard, and regretting that Edna had left without her circum-<pb n=""/> stances being fully exposed by him; and the farmer was also thinking how great would be Richard's disappointment when he learned that during the past year the Stranger's Home had changed hands, and the former landlord had gone to settle in the far west. But of these things he said nothing, and when they landed upon the wharf in the town the young sailor walked away in the direction of the inn, without speaking. The night had as yet scarcely departed, and he trod the streets alone; then, placing his chest beneath the branches of the tree opposite the Home, he waited for its hospitable doors to be opened.</p> 
               <p>When Richard left the wharf Nathan pushed off from the shore, and turned the Swallow's prow towards the ferry-house.</p> 
               <p>"Now," he exclaimed, "the way is clear once more, and who knows but times may soon be again as they were before Richard or Edna came there? I hope it may be so, or I too shall soon leave for parts unknown, where the name of Jeffers will awake no scandal. At times I begin to weary of my present manner of living, and sigh for some little cottage-home, where I could be surrounded by those who would love me, and draw me away from unworthy companions." And then Nathan's mind seemed to rove far away to bygone times, and there was an expression of sadness about his face that he seldom wore; and, finally, his voice broke out into a low, plaintive air, and he listlessly guided the boat to the opposite harbor.</p> 
               <p>There was no one astir yet; so he made her fast, and, going cautiously to his room, throw himself upon his couch, and soon fell into a deep slumber, from which<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC5991-00000160"/> he did not awake until he was disturbed by the voice of Mr. Ashland requesting him to attend to the ferry-boat, as Richard had left as unceremoniously as did Edna the morning previous. Nathan did not inform the family that he had carried Richard to Newport during the night, but mechanically obeyed orders, wondering, to all appearance, at his absence, as much as any one of the family. When Lucy was told in the morning that he had left the ferry-house, she immediately went to his room to ascertain if he had left her any note whereby she could gain a clue to his place of destination, or learn if he ever intended to return; but she found nothing there that belonged to him, except a few cast-off garments that he had thought unworthy of removal; and, returning to her chamber, she wept for long hours such bitter tears as she had never shed before. Mr. Ashland had gone to the field as soon as breakfast was over, and thus was spared the pain of witnessing his daughter's grief. But Mrs. Ashland went often to Lucy's side and tried to soothe her, by telling her that he was a poor stranger, and it would be better to set her affections on some one whom they had known longer. Bitterly did she regret now that she had not known her daughter's mind before; and she wondered, too, that she had not noticed more attentively Lucy's preference for the young sailor, and thought more seriously of the many attentions he had paid her; but it was past now, and Mrs. Ashland resolved to make light of the attachment, and, perhaps, her child would soon forget him, now that he was gone.</p> 
               <p>Dinner-time had not arrived when Prue came down<pb n=""/> to see what was the reason that the school did not keep. She was informed by Mrs. Ashland that it was not very convenient to teach that day, but it would be resumed on the morrow.</p> 
               <p>"Where is Miss Edna?" said Prue, looking around to see her after whom she inquired.</p> 
               <p>"She has not returned from town yet," said Mrs. Ashland.</p> 
               <p>"What! did n't she come back? Why, I believe she has never stayed away from here before, since she first came here to live. Why, an't it strange? But what's the matter with you all? You look so sober like, as if something real bad had happened."</p> 
               <p>Lucy broke out into a fresh burst of grief, while Mrs. Ashland could hardly restrain her tears, so overcome was she by the events that had so recently transpired in her previously quiet home. But in a few moments all was explained to Prue; for, from early childhood, the kind-hearted negress had always been the first to sympathize in their afflictions, and also to rejoice over their prosperity. When Prue was told that Edna had left, probably to return no more, she was so surprised that it was many minutes before she could make a remark; and then she gave way to violent bursts of sorrow, and vehement exclamations, such as, "O, dear! O, massy sake! that my poor old ears should hear this!" But it is the order of nature that after every storm succeeds a calm; and thus it was in the case of Prue; for, as her loud expressions of grief subsided, she remarked that God had ordered this, and He knew more than those He afflicted, and in all things it was the best way to submit willingly to his decrees.</p> 
               <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC5991-00000161"/> 
               <p>Then all three went into the square chamber that Edna had occupied. Prue looked around on the various garments hanging on the pegs in the closet, and then carelessly repeated what the owner had said that morning before she left. "But never mind, <emph>Miss</emph> Ashland," she continued; "I don't keer a penny about the gownds, for I've got 'siderable clothes now. I only mention it to let you know that the dear soul thought of me and Sammy when she knew she should n't come back no more."</p> 
               <p>While Mrs. Ashland and Prue had been talking, Lucy had opened the little box and found the note left by Edna. Here enough was explained to show that she never expected to return to the ferry-house again, which caused many a heartfelt sigh from those who had become so much attached to her and the child. Lucy, with tearful eyes, collected the various articles that had been the property of Edna, and, after taking out the garments designed for Prue and Sammy, placed them within the trunk and turned the key.</p> 
               <p>"That is right, child," said her mother; "all that we find belonging to her around the house we will save for her, and send them to her if we ever find out where she is."</p> 
               <p>When Sammy was told that Frederick had gone away and would come back no more, his dark eyelids drooped, and, stealing quietly away to their little play-house in the garden, he looked at the rude toys they had manufactured together, and wept as sincere tears as any that had been shed for the departed.</p> 
               <p>Nathan crossed and recrossed the bay, but he was far from being happy; his plans had nearly all met his ex-<pb n=""/> pectations, but he did not feel that delight in Richard's absence that he had supposed he should. He fancied that Mr. Ashland and his wife appeared less cordial than usual, and Lucy had not spoken to him since the evening prior to Richard's departure. Still, when he looked around the farm-house, and saw the broad and well-cultivated acres, he could not bear to leave them. So he resolved to redouble his industry, and bring back Mr. and Mrs. Ashland's esteem, if he had forfeited it; and to see if time would not eradicate the love that Lucy bore Richard, now that he was absent. He arose early, and labored late, and on every occasion sought to make himself agreeable to the daughter; but she seldom accepted a favor from him when she could avoid it.</p> 
               <p>Thus time sped on at the homestead. Lucy was deeply grieved at the neglect of her lover, that he had not left any token to assure her that she still possessed his heart. In this respect it appeared that he had been less thoughtful than Edna, and it seemed that this was the most unkind act he could have done. But, with more resolution than she was thought to have, Lucy nerved herself to the task of controlling her emotions, and resumed the school the next day, and matters went on nearly as usual at the ferry-house.</p> 
               <p>But we will now follow the fortunes of Richard. He sat upon the lid of his green chest until the wide front door of the inn was thrown back, and then, crossing the street, he requested a small room, saying that he wished to occupy it a few days.</p> 
               <p>"O, certainly," replied the good-natured and rather vermilion-faced bar-keeper. "We have several rooms<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC5991-00000162"/> unoccupied, and you can have your choice." And, leading the way, he conducted Richard to the same chamber where Nathan had visited the invalid years before.</p> 
               <p>Richard said he was satisfied with the room, and returned for his chest. And soon he fastened his chamber door, and lay down to drive off anxiety and loneliness by sleep; for at the ferry-house he had generally sought his pillow early, and now the deprivation of a night's rest was sensibly felt. When at length sleep did steal over the lids of the young sailor, he did not waken until the birds had finished their morning songs, and sought the noonday shade. Hastily dressing himself, he went below and ordered a light breakfast, of which he partook but sparingly, and then sent for the landlord, who appeared in a few moments, and inquired his pleasure.</p> 
               <p>"Can you tell me," said Richard, "anything concerning a gentleman who stopped here some two years and a half ago? I have been informed that he was sick, and was accompanied by a French servant, who was very devoted to him, but could not speak English; and I have also been informed that I resemble the gentleman in looks." Thus far he had but repeated what Nathan had told him, and then he added, "I cannot tell his name, nor whither he went after he left here; but I am very anxious to know, as I wish to see him on business of importance."</p> 
               <p>"Really, sir," said the landlord, thoughtfully, "I am sorry for you, but I cannot give you any information respecting the Stranger's Home so far back as that, for I have not occupied the house above a year."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Richard arose to his feet and strode the floor hurriedly, exclaiming, "Nathan knew this, and it was but to get the gold that he gave me the information which he knew would be worthless! But he shall yet receive his dues, for I will go back to the ferry-house and expose his villany!" And, seizing his hat, he was about to rush towards the door, when the landlord called him back, saying that he had just thought of one that he guessed could give him some information.</p> 
               <p>"There is a housemaid," said Mr. Tunstall, "or rather a young woman who was a housemaid, living a little way down the street here, that I guess can tell you something about it. She used to live here about that time, and I believe has since married a man who came along as servant to some gentleman."</p> 
               <p>Richard knew nothing of the love existing between Jacques Delorme and Dorcas Kendrick, who the reader will remember lived at the Stranger's Home, and was the means of bringing about the interview between Mr. Sydenham and Nathan; and, after a few inquiries, and telling the landlord he should soon return, Richard went out in the direction of the house where Dorcas Delorme and her husband resided. Rapping at the front door, the summons was speedily answered by the happy and rosy-cheeked wife, who invited him into her best room, and then, with a half-bashful blush, waited for him to make known his errand. The young sailor complimented the pleasant little place she inhabited, and the neatness of her surroundings, and then gradually inquired about the Stranger's Home,-how long she lived there, etc.,-and finally broached the subject so near his heart.</p> 
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC5991-00000163"/> 
               <p>In these days, if a stranger wished to make business inquiries, he would be expected to do so without any preface, and with the utmost velocity. But steam and electricity in those days were far off in the future, and customs and ideas kept pace with locomotion.</p> 
               <p>"Do you remember," said Richard, "when you lived at the inn, that a stranger came there, accompanied by a French servant, and that the gentleman was very ill?"</p> 
               <p>"How long ago was it?" inquired Dorcas.</p> 
               <p>Richard told the period that had been stated to him.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I should think I did," said Dorcas, smiling.</p> 
               <p>The young man was now almost wild with joy, but he governed his feelings so as to appear calm, and was about to continue his interrogation, when the husband entered, and Dorcas introduced him to her guest; for Richard had told her his name.</p> 
               <p>Jacques bowed and extended his hand; and when his wife pronounced his name, he still retained the hold he had taken, and looked so earnestly into Richard's face, that the sailor's eyes sought the floor, nor did he look up until he heard his name pronounced, and then the exclamation, "Thank God, he is found! Mr. Sydenham can now end his days in peace!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, how wild you look, Jacques!" said Dorcas, springing to his side. "Are you ill?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Dorcas; but I would be willing to wager my life on it that this young man is son to my old master in England, whom brother Claude is with now."</p> 
               <p>Richard was so overcome with gladness that he threw himself heavily into a chair, burying his face with his hands, as if to retain the ideas that had been<pb n=""/> presented by this interview. "Can it be possible," he said, "that I shall yet find my parents and kindred?"</p> 
               <p>"No, Mr. Sydenham," said Jacques, "you will never see your mother this side of heaven; but, if you will take the trouble to go to England, you will find your father, a retired gentleman of wealth, beloved and respected by all who know him."</p> 
               <p>At first Richard looked around to discover if all he heard were real, or if he were at the inn dreaming of what occupied his waking hours; but the happy face and cheerful voice of Dorcas, and Jacques' odd mistakes in speaking English, assured him that his destiny was about to assume a brighter hue. Long he sat talking of the past, and heard from Jacques that a strange young man, calling himself Henry Jeffers, came to the inn and told Mr. Sydenham that he knew his son, and would bring him there,-that he resided in New York;-and that his master gave him money for that purpose, but he never returned.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sydenham mourned at the disappointment, and, after waiting in vain at Newport for many weeks, in hopes that the young man would keep his word, they went to New York, and renewed their fruitless search. But there they could learn nothing of any one by the name of Richard Conworth, and they returned to England, where Mr. Sydenham had remained ever since, his health still feeble, and he discouraged in regard to finding his son. This tale was plain to Richard, for Nathan had acknowledged most of it with respect to himself, but not with any good motive; for the reader is already aware of his thoughts at the time he made the communication to the young sailor. And<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC5991-00000164"/> Richard felt persuaded that Nathan must have over-heard his conversation with Lucy on the dye-tub,-though he never learned how,-and conjectured the relationship from his similarity to his father.</p> 
               <p>In a few days a ship was to sail from Newport to England, and Richard resolved to take passage in her, Jacques agreeing to accompany him on a visit to his former master. When Richard returned to the inn his spirits were as light as if buoyed by ether; and he felt that he could scarcely wait until the Sappho would be ready to sail, so impatient was he to see his father. His mind, too, dwelt on Lucy. He could not bear to leave America without telling her of his pleasant prospects, and he decided to go over to the ferry-house, after he had made preparations for his voyage, and see her once more.</p> 
               <p>A week or more passed away, and Richard was ready to go on board the vessel, which was lying at the wharf waiting for a fair wind to take her seaward. "I must see Lucy to-night," he mused, as he stood on the shore opposite the breastwork of the low port, and looked across the bay; "for without her to share my happiness I should care but little about possessions." And then, seating himself near where the tide swept in, laden with bright shells and numerous relics from the ocean's depths, he sent his thoughts backward on the wings of time, to the period when he, a small boy, dwelt in the fisherman's hut, on Scotland's shore. The old fisherman and his wife were kind to him in their rude way, and Richard remembered the many little sacrifices they had made for him; and now he meditated with gratitude upon all, and hoped they were still living, that he might repay the care and<pb n=""/> bounty he had received in their humble dwelling. The day was well-nigh passed when he went back to the busy town and sought the noble ship's side, to learn if she would leave with the morrow; and when he received the answer that she would haul off into the stream early the next morning, he determined to cross the bay that night. Returning to the inn, he arranged his costume with great care, and walked down to the house where Jacques and Dorcas dwelt, to apprise them of the time the Sappho would start. He did not leave there until the stars grew thick above, for he loved to hear Jacques tell of the many places he had visited in company with his father, and, from time to time, he learned many of the particulars of his history. For, after Nathan's deception, at Newport, Mr. Sydenham had grown more communicative, and would talk with Jacques about the past; and this evening Richard also learned that David Conworth and his wife were yet living, and that when his father visited them he had enabled them to purchase a neat little cottage, surrounded by a few acres of land, which the old couple cultivated in quiet and plenty; but they expressed a great desire to see Richard, and Mr. Sydenham had promised that if he ever found his son he should visit them.</p> 
               <p>"Why did not my father advertise for his lost child?" said Richard, after Jacques had done speaking.</p> 
               <p>"He did in New York," replied the other, "after he was so deceived at Newport, and in London, also, before he came here; but all to no purpose."</p> 
               <p>As it was now growing late, Richard bade the faithful Jacques and his wife good-night, and, entering a<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC5991-00000165"/> small boat he had hired for that purpose, soon pushed off towards the opposite shore. As he approached the land, he leaned upon his oars, and floated with the incoming tide, until he was far beyond the pier; then, mooring his boat in a little inlet, he took the foot-path that led to the ferry-house, and was soon among the old, familiar scenes. There were no lights flickering at the windows, save in the kitchen; and all was still, except the heavy breathings of the tenants of the barn-yard, and the everlasting dash of the surge. Old Bose and Watch lay stretched on the grass before the porch, but they did not bark as Richard came up, for they knew by the instinct of the ear, and the faint light of the stars, that a friend approached, and there was no need of giving warning to the inmates of the house. Richard stooped to caress the faithful night-watchers, and then, ascertaining that Lucy's window was open, he stepped to the corn-crib, took the light ladder that rested against the peak, and placed it beneath her window; then, gathering a small handful of pebbles, he ascended until he nearly reached the top, when he gave them a gentle toss upon her pillow.</p> 
               <p>The young girl started from her dream, which was of the one so near her, and called, "Richard, is it you who have done this?" and then, becoming conscious of what she had said, she heard his voice, in a whisper, saying,</p> 
               <p>"Lucy, prepare yourself, quickly, and come to the school-room; for I have much to say to you."</p> 
               <p>Lucy sprang lightly from the bed, and, throwing a shawl about her, looked beneath her window, and there, on the low rounds of the ladder, she beheld him for whom she had shed so many tears within the<pb n=""/> last week. "I will come, Richard," she said, with a happy smile; and, bounding back to where she had laid the garments she had worn during the day, she speedily robed herself, went down the front stairway, and was presently pressed to the young sailor's breast, with a "God bless you, Lucy! you are the sheet anchor of my soul."</p> 
               <p>When they were seated in the little room devoted to the school exercises, Richard commenced with the interview with Nathan in his chamber the evening after he saw her last, and narrated every particular that had occurred since then, to the present time, and told her of his intention to sail on the morrow, in the Sappho, for England.</p> 
               <p>"It is strange what became of that note you threw into my room," said Lucy, after listening to all the details of the remarkable train of circumstances which promised so happy a result.</p> 
               <p>"I do not think it strange, Lucy," replied Richard; "for I think that Nathan, who is an embodiment of evil, heard my steps, and when I returned to my room he took it from where I left it. But let him do his worst. In spite of him, I am confident you will yet be mine; for, when in a few months I return with a <emph>name</emph> and fortune, your parents will consent that you shall become my wife."</p> 
               <p>"But what shall we say of Nathan's motives, Richard, when he told you that your father was still living, and where he put up at Newport?"</p> 
               <p>"I think, dearest, that he told me the former to aggravate me, thinking it impossible for me to acquire further information, and the latter he told me for gold;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC5991-00000166"/> and the sum I gave him he is very welcome to, as by that means I shall be restored to one who has long mourned and searched for me."</p> 
               <p>And then the conversation turned upon Edna. Richard told her who sat by his side of all that she had said to him,-of her interview on the rocks with Nathan, her love for Charles Aylesbury, her grief for <unclear>his</unclear> death,-ending with a description of her last passage across the bay to Newport, and the death of her husband. Lucy's surprise knew no bounds, as she listened to Richard's recital concerning her who had so long been their guest; but, as it was Edna's desire, they both concluded to say nothing of these things to Mr. and Mrs. Ashland until Richard's return, when he would try to discover where she and Freddy were gone.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you remember, Lucy," said Richard, "that I told you once I thought I had seen Edna before, somewhere, but I could n't recollect the particulars then? Well, the other day, when I was thinking of London, it occurred to me that many years ago, when our vessel was in port, I was walking along a fashionable street in the great metropolis, and, as I came opposite a large mansion, I heard a shriek, and, looking up, discovered that a little girl had dropped a beautiful pet dog from the second story window above me. In an instant I caught off my tarpaulin, and, holding it directly beneath the window, secured the little creature in my hat, unharmed. The little girl was overjoyed at my success in saving her favorite, and I was invited to enter by a beautiful woman, who, I think now, was her mother, and was treated to a great many luxuries; and the little girl, who, I feel convinced, was<pb n=""/> Edna, gave me some pieces of gold coin, which I kept very sacred for many years before I parted with them. I was very young then, and the incident but a trifling one, which, I suppose, accounts for my not remembering it more readily."</p> 
               <p>Soon Richard and Lucy arose to go into the house, and communicate to her parents his bright prospects. Mr. and Mrs. Ashland felt, at first, rather incredulous, and found it a bitter trial to have their long-cherished faith in Nathan shaken; but, as Richard related, in a clear and succinct manner, the events of the few preceding days, they were persuaded that he was speaking the truth, and both regretted their harshness to him.</p> 
               <p>"But," said the young sailor, "I do not ask you to condemn Nathan on my testimony alone; but when I return I may be able to produce proofs of his villany which you cannot doubt."</p> 
               <p>After a little more conversation, Richard bade the ferryman and his wife good-night, and, wishing Lucy an affectionate adieu, returned to the inlet, and was soon wafted by his tiny sail towards the town.</p> 
               <p>When Nathan, in his chamber, heard Richard enter the kitchen, he crept down the back stairs, and listened, in the wash-room, to the young sailor's conversation with Mr. Ashland's family. His face was of an ashen hue, and bitterly he regretted that he had imparted any information to Richard concerning his father. That which he had meant should cause him more sorrow had proved to be the greatest blessing to him; and now everything betokened for Richard an auspicious future, while Nathan would, if he remained at the ferry-house, be disgraced and exposed in regard<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC5991-00000167"/> to his conduct towards the young sailor; and he also feared that, by some means, his deception about Charles Aylesbury and his unmanly threats to Edna might be brought to light. When Richard closed the door, he stole back to his bed, and mused on various plans, to try to find one better than the others to escape the disgrace which he felt awaited him; and, ere he left his bed, he had resolved to quit the farm before Richard returned from England. Having arrived at this determination, he rose before the sun, and attended to his accustomed duties, as if he had not been an eavesdropper to anything unusual.</p> 
               <p>Lucy was happy now, and she also was astir before the sun was up, her merry voice echoing in song from room to room, as in former days, ere she experienced sorrow. Mr. and Mrs. Ashland, having decided to say nothing to Nathan about Richard's visit till his return, endeavored to treat the young farmer as pleasantly as ever; but there was a constraint upon the honest couple's manners, which Nathan could not but sensibly feel; and, though Lucy was too light-hearted to frown upon him now, once or twice she could not avoid throwing out broad hints that he had done good when he intended to do evil, which Nathan appeared not to notice.</p> 
               <p>And thus, for some time, things continued at the ferry-house. Prue came but seldom, except when sent for to labor, for she said it was so lonely without Edna and Freddy that she would as lief stay at her little cabin, when she knew they were all well; and Sammy merely came at the regular school-hours, and went directly home when the pupils were dismissed.</p>

               <p>SEVERAL weeks had passed since Edna was so rudely sent from Mrs. Watkins', and escorted by the kind-hearted Monieda to her cottage. Autumn was rapidly approaching, and already the verdure was departing from the foliage, and many trees were tinted by the bright hues which precede the fall of the leaf. Still Edna and Freddy were inmates of the home that contained Wenoma and her daughter; for the life-tide of the aged Indian woman was fast ebbing, and the dark-eyed girl begged her guest to stay and share her cottage when her mother should be laid beneath the broad tree that shaded her father's grave. At length the last day came that Wenoma was to open her eyes upon this wide and busy world, and, as the hour of dissolution drew near, she pronounced a blessing on her child, expressing a firm belief that they should meet again in the far-off hunting-grounds when it<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC5991-00000168"/> pleased the Great Spirit; then, feebly wrapping her blanket about her, she went calmly to her rest.</p> 
               <p>The event had been long expected by Monieda, and yet she felt lonely; but it was a great solace to her to have the companionship of Edna, and the prattle and ingenious questions of Frederick interested and diverted her. Edna loved to watch the changes of nature, and muse on its teachings; and many a pleasant hour did she and Monieda spend rambling in the forest where the Indian maiden formerly dwelt. In one of these rural excursions Edna descried the name of Nathan Fossett rudely carved on the smooth bark of a birch-tree, and inquired of her companion if she knew him who bore that name.</p> 
               <p>"Not now," said Monieda; "for he comes no longer to our cottage. But he used to come, and my heart was very light then; for he was always so kind to my mother and me!"</p> 
               <p>"But why don't he come now, Monieda?"</p> 
               <p>"I presume he is not in this vicinity; for he came one evening and said that he was going away, and did not know that he should ever return; but he did not tell me why, nor have I seen him since." And the young girl turned away her head, as if she scorned to show emotion or love for one who had deserted her. But Edna did not appear to notice this, and inquired how long it was since she had last seen him.</p> 
               <p>"Last winter, when the snow was piled up against the doors, and almost darkened the windows, he came and seemed very sad. But, do you know him, or where he went?"</p> 
               <p>"I do, and where he lives now. He is not far from you."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>Monieda's face grew crimson, for a new idea seemed to break in upon her mind, and call up thoughts that she had never revealed. But she said no more, and they walked silently along until they grew weary, and turned their faces homeward.</p> 
               <p>In the evening, after the candles were lighted and Freddy soundly sleeping, each took her book to read. At length Edna laid aside her book, and, taking up a pen, began to write on a blank sheet of paper that lay on the table. Monieda leaned over the table, and watched her swiftly-moving pen with deep interest, while the color came and went on her cheeks. Putting down her book, she took from her pocket a small key, opened a drawer in the table where they sat, and, drawing out a scrap of paper on which was written a verse of poetry, laid it upon the sheet on which Edna wrote.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Lancaster dropped the implement she held in her hand, and, gazing into Monieda's face with surprise, inquired where she obtained that.</p> 
               <p>"Nathan gave it to me," she replied. "And this, too, he brought here," added Monieda, producing a copy of the first letter that Nathan sent to England, directed to Charles Aylesbury, which she had neglected to destroy when he took away its counterpart, and thus it had remained in her drawer ever since. But to-day, when Edna said that she knew Nathan, she thought of all the circumstances she had learned concerning her guest; and she had in part made up her mind that Mrs. Lancaster was the one whose letters she had copied to please him, though she could not reconcile the story of her being destitute of education with Edna's appearance. Saying nothing, however, she handed her com-<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC5991-00000169"/> panion the letter, and leaned back in her chair to watch her countenance.</p> 
               <p>Edna, with stoical firmness, read and re-read the forged letter, until its plain characters seemed to move into one confused mass of hieroglyphics; but, unable to form any definite conjecture of its meaning, she begged Monieda to tell her every circumstance connected therewith.</p> 
               <p>"I will," said the girl; and, commencing with her first acquaintance with Nathan, she told of his kindness to her and her mother while they lived in their forest-home, of his hiring their present abode, and of his occasional visits until the previous winter, when he told her he was going away. Monieda did not know-but Edna guessed the truth-that Nathan had then resolved to obtain the fair English woman in marriage, knowing that her father and husband were both wealthy, and that she would eventually come in possession of some entailed estates; and, consequently, he had ceased to visit the Indian girl. Monieda had written but three letters, and she repeated to Edna, as nearly as she could remember, the contents. She supposed that money had been sent prior to the writing of the first two, as both acknowledged the receipt of certain sums. In the second the desire had been expressed to remain where she was for a year or more, until Freddy became older and better able to endure the voyage across the Atlantic. Then Nathan had told her that the lady had received a letter from her husband, saying that his business was of so urgent a nature that it required his constant attendance, and that it would be at a great sacrifice if he came over for her; and she had written, replying that she did not wish<pb n=""/> him to make the journey, as she was going to return to her father's. And since that, which was now about two years ago, he had not desired her to copy any more, telling her that the lady, having learned to write well enough to conduct her own correspondence, had moved away to Philadelphia.</p> 
               <p>The truth was, that when the time approached for Charles to visit America, Nathan dreaded exposure, and devised a scheme to keep him in England, first sending him word that Lizzie wished to remain at the ferry-house for another year; and then, when he found Mr. Aylesbury still determined to come, informing him that she was going back to her father's. Charles had perceived a certain coldness in Lizzie's letters, never suspecting they were forgeries; and when he learned that she was about to return to her father, he wrote no more, but endeavored to banish her from his heart.</p> 
               <p>"O, Monieda!" exclaimed Edna, when the dark-eyed girl had finished speaking, "can it be possible that you love this monster in human shape? You little know the misery he has caused to those who never injured him, or you could not for a moment harbor a kind thought towards him. It is plain to me now that he must have committed these forgeries for the sake of the money contained in the answers; but how he ascertained that I expected money I know not, unless he listened at my door the night I held an interview with Charles in my chamber. It must have been so. But, O, thank heaven! Charles is still living; and yet how came there an account of his death in the newspaper? That, too, must have been a forgery; for when I compare the date of this letter with the time that his death was announced, I find that the letter is<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC5991-00000170"/> dated afterwards, and Nathan heard that account read. But to-morrow I will return to Mr. Ashland's with this letter, and Nathan shall explain all, or the law shall deal with him as he deserves."</p> 
               <p>"O, Mrs. Lancaster, forbear, I pray you!" said Monieda, pressing her trembling hand to her burning brow. "Tell me where he is, and I will seek him. I know he will explain all; and, if he has aught belonging to you, he will return it. Nathan is not bad at heart; and, although he may do wrong, he has good qualities, that, if the bad were cast aside, would produce good deeds. O, how often has he brought plenty to our cabin when I was weary, and game scarce! Forgive him, Edna; for my sake forgive him!"</p> 
               <p>"And do you love him so well, Monieda, that you would still overlook the past?"</p> 
               <p>"I do love him still," said the Indian maiden; "and ever shall, though we may never meet again."</p> 
               <p>"We shall meet again!" said Nathan, throwing open the door of the little sitting-room, and coming to Monieda's side. Then, placing a well-filled purse in Edna's lap, he added, "Take that, Mrs. Lancaster; it is all the reparation I can make you now. If I could recall the past, I gladly would; but it is now too late."</p> 
               <p>Nathan was very pale, and his voice trembled; once he arose and paced the room in great agitation. Edna sat with her head bowed upon her hand, with the untouched purse lying in her lap, while Monieda was calm and motionless. At length Nathan seated himself on the settle, and begged them to listen to him while he told of the past.</p> 
               <p>"You will hate me, Monieda," he said, "when you learn how I have deceived you; and yet in part I sought<pb n=""/> for gold to make you and your mother more comfortable, for I have ever loved you, though at times I tried to persuade myself that I did not, and kept away for long months to see how I could bear the absence; but I invariably returned, and many times, when you did not think me near you, have I, in some ambush, listened to your voice, and sighed to think that I was not more worthy of you. And now, for a week past, since I left the ferry-house, I have spent every evening within sound of your voice, but dared not enter, for I saw through the casement that Edna was here, and it was my intention to write to her in a few days and tell her all; for, although I have had momentary sensations of pleasure in obtaining the money I so much coveted, my course has been far from a happy one." And then Nathan told Mrs. Lancaster how he acquired the information concerning Charles, on the night of her interview with him.</p> 
               <p>The reader will remember the circumstances of that evening, when he remained till a late hour at the collier's hut in the forest. When he returned to his home, he obtained a ladder from the old crib, and, planting it against the side of the house beneath his window, began to ascend. Edna's chamber window was but a few feet from his own, that overlooked the bay; and as Nathan ascended, he glanced over the top of the short white curtain in Edna's room, and discerned her pale face, and by her side the stranger guest. This was sufficient to excite his curiosity; so he descended again, and, removing the ladder, placed it directly beneath Edna's window; and then, cautiously mounting, bent his ear to the casement, where there<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC5991-00000171"/> was a small fracture in the glass, and thus he became possessed of the key to all their arrangements.</p> 
               <p>Then Nathan watched for the coming of the vessel that was to bring her the sum of money, and as soon as he could be admitted on her deck he inquired for the package for Miss Benton. The captain delivered it to him, and, as no one was present at the time, when she asked the mate for it he could tell her nothing about it; but probably, if she had called again, some explanation might have taken place, and Nathan been exposed; so he forged the death of Charles, and paid the printer's boy to be sure that it was inserted. The unsuspecting boy was faithful, and thus was she deceived.</p> 
               <p>"I have saved enough from my wages, Mrs. Lancaster," said Nathan, "to repay what I have taken, and I have every reason to believe that Mr. Aylesbury still lives." And then, glancing at the purse, he continued, "If I could make other reparation, I gladly would; but I have determined to quit my corrupt associates, and shall annoy you no more, for I am going away to the far west, where I shall assume my real name, and Henry Jeffers will endeavor, by his upright conduct, to atone for the past, and lead a different life for the future."</p> 
               <p>And thus Nathan continued, while his companions listened. Monieda was pale and silent, and Edna spoke but seldom. Her joy knew no bounds when she thought that Charles was still alive, and she could hardly wait for the return of another ship ere she wrote to him. She did not upbraid Nathan, for she saw that his conscience was awake, doing a more thorough work of reformation than all the punishment<pb n=""/> she could bring to bear upon his guilty mind; and she merely said, tossing the purse into Monieda's lap, "This will enable me to reward partially your kindness, and it is but a small return for all the attention I have met with."</p> 
               <p>"I do not want it," said Monieda, rising and letting the purse fall heavily on the floor; and then she sought the window, and looked out upon the stars, where Nathan soon joined her, and, timidly placing his hand upon her arm, as if fearing a repulse, he whispered,</p> 
               <p>"Monieda, can you forgive me? I am not aware that I ever injured you, although I have deceived you; but, if you will forgive me, and still be mine, I will endeavor to be in future all that you can wish me to be." Low sobs were heard to burst from Monieda's breast, and then she took his extended hand, and bowed her head upon his shoulder.</p> 
               <p>Several days passed away, and then there was a wedding at the little cottage. There were but few to witness the bridal of Henry Jeffers and Monieda; and when the ceremony was over, Edna approached the happy couple-happy, despite the past-and handed the bride a small package as a marriage gift, requesting her not to open it till she reached her western home, for which she was about to start. Monieda smiled, and with many thanks accepted the present; for she half guessed its contents, and would not annoy her friend by a refusal. The parcel, as the reader may conjecture, contained the money which Nathan returned to Mrs. Lancaster.</p> 
               <p>Edna was still to reside at the little cottage until she could receive an answer to the letter she had writ-<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC5991-00000172"/> ten Charles Aylesbury. Monieda was pleased with the prospect of a home in the then far west, for she remembered the tales she had heard her mother tell of the pleasant manner of living there, and the happy companionship that existed between the people of the settlements and the friendly Indians that surrounded them; and she thought, too, what a pleasure it would be to instruct those who had never been taught before in the branches she had studied, and found so useful in the past. But it was not without a slight shade of sadness that she bade adieu to the scenes of her childhood, and the friends who had so kindly assisted her since her removal to the thickly-settled part of the town.</p> 
               <p>One morning after Monieda's departure, when Edna had sent Freddy to a little private school that was kept near by, she put on her bonnet and shawl and went down towards the wharf, where so often she had stepped from the ferry-boat, to see if she could meet with any of the Ashland family; but when the boat came up, a stranger stood at the helm, and no passenger whom she knew was on board. Nathan had told her that Richard had found his father; but he did not tell her the part that he had acted in the affair, for he thought with regard to that, as to many things that he had said and done, they were past now, and he wished oblivion to roll over them. When Edna found that there was no familiar face in the sloop, she turned away, and walked homeward in a musing mood, with her eyes bent upon the ground. Presently a heavy step came near, and then a tall form intercepted her path.</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"Lizzie," he said, "how came you here, in this strange place, alone?"</p> 
               <p>"Father!" half shrieked Edna; and then, grasping his hand, she said, "Forgive me, O! forgive me, for I could not stay at home any longer as the wife of Edward!"</p> 
               <p>"I know it, child-I know it all now; but too late I learned it, and much I feared I should never behold you again. And, O! where is Freddy?"</p> 
               <p>"He is safe, father, and not far from here."</p> 
               <p>"But why, child, when you fled, did you encumber yourself with your little brother?"</p> 
               <p>"Because I thought of the last words of my dying mother. 'Lizzie,' she said, 'be kind to your infant brother, and never forsake him.' And, father, you little knew the cruel blows his stepmother inflicted on his tender flesh when you were not present."</p> 
               <p>"I did not know it then, dear, but I learned it all after you fled; for, one year since, on her dying bed, she confessed all,-the deception she used in making me believe that she would love and nurture my children, and which caused me to marry her so soon after the death of your sainted mother,-and the arts she employed to convince me that it was for the interest of all that you should be wedded to her only son by a former marriage, and thus keep her own property and mine in the family."</p> 
               <p>"But, father, you seemed to wish me to become the wife of Edward as much as did my stepmother, although I told you I never could love him as I had loved Charles Aylesbury."</p> 
               <p>"Well, Lizzie, I would not have urged you had I not believed her when she told me that Charles had<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC5991-00000173"/> ceased to write to you, and had proved false; for I did not know that she had intercepted the letters until I learned it from her own lips in her last hours of life. But come, let us hasten to the spot where you have left Freddy, for I am anxious to see him again. In the past loneliness I have found, by sad experience, that there is no happiness away from those we love, and are bound by nature's laws to protect."</p> 
               <p>After seeing her father seated in the cottage on the knoll, Lizzie went out to bring Frederick. She thought that her father seemed very much changed,-the cold reserve that he had ever worn having passed away,-and how fervently she wished that his affectionate manner might last, after the first joy of their meeting was over! In this wish she was not disappointed; for, after she returned with her brother, they all sat down together, and long they conversed of the past, and their father's present business at Newport.</p> 
               <p>"After you left us," said Mr. Westbourne, "for a week or more we did not think very seriously of your going, supposing you would return again in a few days, or weeks at most; but, as time passed on, and we heard nothing from you, we began to make inquiries, but could learn nothing, except that you stayed at Mrs. Ormsby's, in Providence, one night, and then left, but did not tell where you were going. And, after continuing our inquiries, from time to time, for a year or more, we abandoned the search, hoping that you would weary of supporting yourself and Freddy, and return to us. And yet I rather rejoiced that you were away from Edward; for, in his exasperation at your leaving him, he displayed so much of his terrific temper that I felt it were not safe for you to be with him."</p> 
               <pb n=""/> 
               <p>"But, father, why he did come to Newport?"</p> 
               <p>"I will tell you, child. There is a neighbor of ours, with whom we became acquainted after you went away, who lives near us on the borders of the Connecticut River, who travelled through Narraganset, and crossed the ferry, and when he came back he talked about a child he saw at the ferry that resembled me very much, although his complexion was different. We questioned him concerning it, when Edward said he should go to the ferry and ascertain the particulars; and accordingly he went. He did not specify any length of time that he should be absent, and I waited patiently for his return till a short time since, when I left home to see if I could learn anything of him or you; and not until yesterday was I apprized of the fatal accident that befell him while crossing to the Narraganset side."</p> 
               <p>And then Lizzie related the particulars of her flight from her father's house, where she and her husband boarded. When she felt that she could not endure Edward's cruel and jealous disposition any longer, she wrote to her old friend, Mrs. Dacre, in London, telling her how faithless Charles had been, and that, in consequence, she had been persuaded to marry her step-mother's son, Edward Lancaster; but she felt that she could not reside with him, and wished to return to England and make her home with her. Mrs. Dacre showed Charles the letter, who seemed very much surprised at its contents, saying that he had not received a line from her since she left London, although he had written repeatedly, and quite as affectionately as ever. Having business in America, he immediately left Lon-<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC5991-00000174"/> don, promising Mrs. Dacre that Lizzie should return with him. He found her at Mrs. Ormsby's, who agreed to give no information concerning her. From Providence, they travelled to Tower Hill, stopping one day to rest at a small inn, where the landlady took Charles to be her husband and Freddy her child; but they thought it best not to make any explanations, lest it should lead to detection. And then Lizzie told her father all about the ferry-house, and the kindness of the inmates. But she said nothing of Nathan, nor of his being the means of her staying there so long; and Mr. Westbourne thought that she remained there from choice, the farm being in so retired a spot, and detection almost impossible.</p> 
               <p>"And did Freddy miss me much?" asked his father.</p> 
               <p>"Yes," said Lizzie, "for the first few weeks he would call almost any gentleman he met 'farver,' even Charles; and that was one reason why, when we were travelling, we were not discovered, and you were successless in your inquiries."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Westbourne looked around on the humble home of his children, and begged Lizzie to make her preparations to return with him as speedily as possible.</p> 
               <p>"But I must visit the old ferry-house first, father," said she, "and thank again and again the Ashland family for all the favors I received there before I came to Newport."</p> 
               <p>The father was very happy to acquiesce in the proposed visit, for he wished to see the quiet home that so long sheltered his children. The next day, therefore, they took seats in the Swallow, and were swiftly borne across the bay to the homestead. Lucy was drawing water from the old sweep-well; but, espying the living<pb n=""/> freight of the sloop as she came up to the pier, with a joyous call to her mother, she bounded to the water's side, and, clasping Edna and Frederick in her arms, almost forgot there was another present, until reminded, by the presence of her mother and Prue, that they, too, were waiting to be received.</p> 
               <p>"The Lord be praised!" said Prue, as soon as she could get breath. "Why, Miss Edna, where have you been? But, bless me, you need n't say nothing to me till I kind of get over being so glad to see you. Well, I guess I will run right up the road, and tell my old man and Sammy that you and Freddy's come back." And, drawing her gay turban further over her eyes, she proceeded homeward, to return with Sammy.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Ashland was sent for to come from the field, to be introduced to Mr. Westbourne; and for several days the happy family remained guests at the ferry-house, and they were joyful days to all. Mutual explanations were made, and when the old ferryman spoke of Nathan, Edna saw plainly that his confidence in the young farmer's integrity was gone. But she forbore to ask any questions, and afterwards learned from Lucy that her father had ascertained some circumstances that produced this change in his opinion of Nathan.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Westbourne thanked Mr. Ashland and his family for the many favors that his children had received, and offered a more substantial recompense, which the ferryman declined, saying that he had met with sufficient reward in possessing their society.</p> 
               <p>At length the hour of parting came; but they did not separate with feelings like those who part as if they might never meet again; for it was arranged that<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC5991-00000175"/> when Richard returned he and Lucy should make their wedding tour to the borders of the Connecticut. And Freddy, too, was to visit the ferry-house every summer, and stay through the warmest months, when he did not attend school.</p> 
               <p>"And you, too, shall come to Connecticut some time, Sammy, and stay all winter, and go to school with Freddy," said Edna, going to his side, where he stood leaning against his mother.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Westbourne smiled at the familiarity that existed without distinction of color, but answered, pleasantly, that it should be as his daughter had said. And then, with a kind good-by to all, the guests re-crossed the ferry, and ere many days were once more within the mansion where Lizzie, who now abandoned the name of Edna, resided previously to her seeking an asylum at Mr. Ashland's.</p> 
               <p>But let us return to Richard. We will not follow the tedious details of his voyage across the ocean, but will take up his history when he arrived at his father's dwelling. Mr. Sydenham received Jacques with evident pleasure, and yet his face wore a mournful expression as he alluded to the past, and his disappointment in not finding his son. But gradually the faithful servant unfolded the joyful tidings that his son still lived, and would soon be with him; and then, when he thought he had sufficiently prepared his mind, Richard was introduced.</p> 
               <p>We will not attempt to describe the delight of Mr. Sydenham, for it would be beyond the power of our pen; and the young sailor was no less happy to find that he still had kindred, and a father, whose declining<pb n=""/> years he would now be permitted to soothe and relieve from care.</p> 
               <p>Richard concealed nothing of his past history from his father. He told him of his love for Lucy, and that it was his desire to return for her as soon as he could be spared for a few months from his parent's side. Mr. Sydenham made no serious objections to the proposal, although he would have preferred that his son should marry one who had been born and educated in England. But when Richard urged the matter, stating what a kind friend Lucy had been to him in the past, and that his father would find her all that a daughter could be toward him in the future, he consented, furnishing his only son with an almost princely sum, not only to defray necessary expenses, but to purchase an estate in America, if he desired; where he would soon follow, having been so well pleased with the country, in his journey, that he had often thought of selling or renting his estates in England, to dwell in some one of the pleasant towns that dot the New England coast.</p> 
               <p>"How came my mother to be on board that fatal ship, father?" said Richard, one day, as he sat by his parent's side, talking of the past and Nathan's deception.</p> 
               <p>"The tale can be soon told," replied Mr. Sydenham, with a sigh.</p> 
               <p>"Your mother had friends living in America, and she often importuned me to visit them in company with her; but my business ever detained me at home. So I procured her a faithful servant, and a nurse for you, and consented to her going to spend a few months with them, when I was to go to America, and return with her. A few days after the ship sailed,<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC5991-00000176"/> there was a terrible storm, and the vessel was never heard from afterwards. Previous to her leaving, I wrote to her friends, mentioning the time that I expected she would be there; and when that time arrived, and she was not heard from, they wrote to me. Then I travelled in search of her and you, but all to no purpose, and for many years I lived in solitude here on the banks of the Thames. After that, I went to Scotland,-not to seek for you and your mother, for I had long mourned you as dead, but to pass away my lonely hours. One day, as I was roaming along by the sea-side, I entered a fisherman's hut. The old couple who inhabited it seemed very sociable, and I talked and lingered long; and when I asked them if they had any children, they told me they had only one, that they picked up from the sea. O, how eagerly I listened to their recital, and compared the date with your loss! And when Mrs. Conworth produced some little fragments of the dress you wore at that time, I remembered it well, and your initials, A. S., were on a small bit of linen, which was a portion of one of your garments. She said she was not aware that she had any remnants of your clothing until a short time previous, when she found them in an old chest that she seldom opened."</p> 
               <p>But we will dwell no longer on this scene, but speak again of Mrs. Lancaster.</p> 
               <p>"Father," she said, one day, as she sat viewing a light, glossy ringlet, that had once graced the head of her mother, "will you tell me," and she looked up timidly, "why my mother so often wept, and looked so sad?"</p> 
               <p>For some moments Mr. Westbourne was silent, and then he said, in a low, smothered tone,</p> 
               <p>"She married against her parents' will, Lizzie, and<pb n=""/> not until the past year did I know what an angel I possessed."</p> 
               <p>And he looked so sad and thoughtful that his daughter never mentioned the subject to him again.</p> 
               <p>When Monieda was established in her new home, she wrote Mrs. Lancaster a letter, expressing her happiness, and thanking her for the gift she had made her. Nathan was leading an honest and industrious career; his good qualities seemed rapidly developing, and eradicating the bad, which had been nurtured by evil influences and associates.</p> 
               <p>When Charles Aylesbury received Lizzie's letter, he could hardly believe that he was not the victim of a dream or delusion; and he read it again and again. Then, rushing from the fashionable inn where he made his home, he sought Mrs. Dacre, and bade her read it too.</p> 
               <p>"Poor Lizzie!" said their mutual friend. "She has indeed seen trouble!"</p> 
               <p>"She shall see no more," said Charles, as he arose to go; "for I will immediately sail for America, and, now that her tyrant is dead, nothing on earth shall separate us."</p> 
               <p>And he kept his word; for in less than a year Lizzie became Mrs. Aylesbury. But she did not leave her American home, as both she and Charles preferred the New World to the Old.</p> 
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/> 
               <p>Another year passed away, and, after the harvest was gathered in, and the annual Thanksgiving to be celebrated, there was a family party at the ferry-house. And, when the large oak table was spread, there sat around it the old ferryman, his wife, and their pet,<pb n="348-349 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC5991-00000177"/> -Arthur Sydenham, and his bride Lucy, and Mr. Sydenham,-and then came Mr. Westbourne, Charles Aylesbury, and his still fair young wife, Lizzie.</p> 
               <p>When the tall candles were lighted, they seemed to cast a brilliant glow over each face, and to make radiant each happy smile of the invited guests. All that was pleasant of the past was discussed, but no shadow was allowed to creep in. And the dark-hued inmates of the little cottage up the road were there, too; for the group would not be complete without them. Prue's age seemed to have retrograded at least half a score of years, and no step was lighter waiting on the guests than hers.</p> 
               <p>When supper was ended, Mrs. Aylesbury went into the kitchen where Prue was, saying,</p> 
               <p>"Here is a Thanksgiving present for Sammy, Aunty Prue." And, reaching her a purse, she continued, "I wish you to take it, and send Sammy over to Newport to one of the best schools until that amount is used; and then let me know, for you remember that it is your wish that Sammy should preach the Gospel, one of these days."</p> 
               <p>"O, massy, <emph>Miss</emph> Aylesbury, this is too much!" said Prue, lifting the corner of her white apron to her eyes. "I hope the Lord will prosper you." And she sank on the dye-tub in the corner, overcome with gratitude.</p> 
               <p>Sammy's large eyes sparkled with joy; and, when the guests were separating, he whispered in Freddy's ear, "I shall always love Miss Edna."</p> 
               <p>And now, reader, as the happy visitants have taken leave of Mr. and Mrs. Ashland and the ferry-house for the present, we, also, take our leave of you, after hoping that you have spent a few hours pleasantly in perusing EDNA, AN ANTIQUE TALE.</p>
