THE author has thought proper to include in this volume "MND AND MATTER: A STORY OF DOMESTIC "FE," written for the "Southern Field and Fireside;" but, owing to the length of the contribution, it was never read by the editor, who, of course, gave no decision on its merits. After remaining- some time on hand for examination, the manuscript was returned, at the request of the author.  &#xD;<pb n="0-5" xml:id="VAC7248-00000003"/>   WILKINS WYDER; OR, THE SUCCESSFUL MAN. CHAPTER I. A THRIFTY village was Hillburg, in which Dr. Andrew Wylder resided, and bright was the star which presided over the birth of his eldest son, Wilkins, on the night of the "th of June, 18-. The doctor at least considered himself fortunate; for his was a beautiful locality, surrounded by honest and agreeable neighbors, among whom he had built a high reputation, and a fortune to correspond with it, giving that peculiar influence to his name which prosperity alone can secure,-all crowned by the birth of an heir. He exemplified in his manners the gentleman of the "old school," of whom scarcely a specimen is left,.-brave, gentle, and punctilious. His first-born happened to be a son, exactly as he had prayed beforehand,--if indeed the earnest wishes of a moral man, aside from any formal acts of devotion, may be called prayer of the heart. Dr. Wylder was further blessed in the qualities of his son, physical and mental. Uniting the amiability of the mother in the expression of the countenance, with the bold features and vigorous symmetry of the father, Master Wilkins created a sensation of delight wherever he ap- peared. His form was that of a young Apollo, which his nice round jacket and jaunty cap set off to the best advan-  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7248-00000004"/> 6        WILKINS WYDER; OR, tage. He was born a gentleman, with the air of command more and more developed as he grew in years. In this he  but inherited his father's constitutional tendencies, fortified' by the daily example of his mother to love virtue for its own sake. This picture must suffice as to Master Wilkins until he is placed at school in his tenth year. Up to this age he had been taught exclusively by his parents, who had taught him to read with tolerable precision. Dr. Wylder had a just ambition, so far as the plans of life might mould the conduct of his son. He believed that there existed in man the elements of true greatness, equal to the fondest conceptions of those who claimed to possess  originality of mind, under the guidance of the purest honor. He had always himself been frank and upright in his dealings, with just enough prudence td save the best half of his income; and, while he valued the good opinion of others, he attached still more importance to his own standard of action, which was, to do right under all cir- cumstances, whether he was understood by the world or  not. He had firmness of nerve and ability of fortune to carry out his ideas of social life and his obligations to his country. His service to the latter had been manifested through the ballot-box, with an occasional speech in public, and a few articles for the press, giving his opinions with dignity and clearness. He had nothing of the demagogue i in his composition; andre held in sovereign contempt all the arts and wiles of the mere politician, whose object was to traffic for the spoils of government, just as a dealer in  merchandise seeks the profits of trade.  Animated by such principles, it was but natural that Dr.  Wylder should look to the future of his sot with all the  hopes of the father and the patriot combined. Never did  Lord Chatham dwellwith more paternalpride and anxiety on the fortunes of his gifted son, known in histtry as the  famous William Pitt, Prime Minister of England, than the father of our hero dwelt on the possibilities of his destiny. i   THE, SUCCESSFUL MAN.       7 Much, of course, depended on his education, and the sort of instructors who were to control it. A wise beginning in this respect was regarded as the pivot on which the whole life of the pupil was to turn,-on which was to depend his triumph or his failure, his happiness or misery. The object far in advance of all others, in the estimation of Dr. Wylder, was to procure a teacher of the requisite qualifi- cations to take charge of Master Wilkins. There was a gentleman who had been engaged several years in an academy, teaching all the branches, from the spelling-book to astronomy; and he was particularly noted as a linguist. His moral character was above reproach; and no objection had ever been raised to his social habits. He was somewhat reserved, though never abrupt, in his manners. Teaching seemed to him. rather an agreeable occupation, in which his faculties could expand and reflect their light on others, than a mere necessity to which he yielded for a support. His talents were of a high grade, improved by the most patient and fastidious culture. E Had he chosen any of the learned professions, he must have excelled, either at the bar, in medicine, or in theology; for, in fact, he was skilled in the principles of them all, without having applied himself to the separate study of either. His thirst for universal knowledge, the concentration of his mind, the strength of his will, and the accuracy with which he framed his deductions, rendered him master of whatever he undertook. Such was Mr. Theodore Wells, a renowned instructor of youth, and a bachelor of fifty. Not willing to trust his son into strange hands from home, exposed t*evil companionship at school, Dr. Wylder resolved to employ a teacher whose moral worth and intel- lectual cultivation would render him a fit associate of his family. While reflecting on the subject of an instructor, he thought of Mr. Wells, with whom he had a mere casual acquaintance. He therefore paid a visit to this gentle- man, and made known his wishes. c  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7248-00000005"/> 8        WILKINS WYDER; OR, "I have called on you, Mr. Wells," said Dr. Wylder, in the most respectful tone, "to ascertain whether it would suit your views to accept a place in my family. I have long been familiar with your character and your success as a teacher, and the high estimation in which- you are held by your patrons. You have now a large number of pupils under your direction in the academy, and your rela- tions with the public are, no doubt, very agreeable; Before I attempt, however, to change these relations by any specific advances on my part, I beg to know whether your engagements or your inclinations give me any hope of prevailing on you to relinquish your school, for the pur- pose of devoting your time to the private instruction of my son, who, now in his tenth year, has never recited a lesson except to his parents, who have taught him to read without having exercised any thing like school-discipline over him. Allow me to say that my object in keeping my son at home throughout the whole course of his education, is to preserve his character from those taints which so easily fasten on the minds of youth who are thrown to- gether in college at a time when the feelings are most impulsive, and when the heart is most susceptible of vice or improper attachments. My son has capacities and dispositions which, if properly directed, will make him the pride of his parents, and possibly in some degree useful to his country. I can vouch for his obedience to duty; and the matter of compensation shall be no barrier, if you are disposed to become a member of my family, in which you will be our daily companion, and our adviser as to the future interests of my son Wilkins." Mr. Wells listened with grave attention to the doctor's remarks, and then replied,-  "I esteem it very gracious on you part, Dr. Wylder, to make this communication to one so humble and unworthy. With my employment and with my patrons I have cause to be satisfied. My aim has been less to acquire property   THSE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       9 by teaching than to exercise myself to some practical end for the good of mankind. I find that my school gives me just that degree of labor which keeps off depression of spirits, to which I am constitutionally prone, or the ten- dency to which has been perhaps established by too intense study when I was young and greedy of knowledge. Of late years I have exerted myself to check this impetuous desire, and, I think, with fair success. You. see me apparently calm, and you have, no doubt, formed a favorable opinion of my qualities as a scholar and as a man, or you would not have honored me with this visit. But, before I give you further trouble, candor urges me to say that I have defects which it would be wrong in me to conceal, in view of the situation in which you offer to place me. It would be to the interest of us both that you should have the confession now, rather than wait for discoveries which might be regretted after I had taken upon myself the office of instructor to your son and the privilege of com- panionship in your family. Besides, the discipline which I would deem necessary might not be such as you would prefer: I am willing to entertain an offer, if we can pos- sibly understand each other, so that no disappointment on either side may be hereafter alleged." With this reply Dr. Wylder gave particular signs of satis- faction; and it was evident that he intended to press his object with additional zeal. Addressing Mr. Wells, he thus disposed of the whole matter:- "I cannot suffer my judgment to be so far impeached as to listen to any reflections on yourself as a warning to my confidence. You will therefore allow me to expect nothing more in the nature of a confession, as you are pleased to call it, in order to frighten me, I suppose, from the task on which my resolution is fixed,--to transfer you from the academy to my private mansion, where you can promote your own happiness and mine in a more con- - tracted sphere of labor, yet, I hope, not less beneficial to  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7248-00000006"/> 10       WILKINS WYDER,; OR, your reputation. Without ciaiming unusual sagacity, I am content with my decision as to the kind of instructor I desire for my son. I have no dread of any imperfections which may show themselves in your character. Whatever they may be, you may consider that you have fulfilled your duty by putting me on my guard in advance; and it will be my risk to suffer" the consequences. It only re- mains for you to name a sum which will be amply remu- nerative for your services as a private tutor in my family." Mr. Wells then stated how much his present school was worth, leaving it to Dr. Wylder to say whether he should be satisfied with less. The latter gentleman at once de- clared that the expense was no obstacle, as his principal design was to secure for his son a teacher in whom he had confidence; and he wished it fully understood that the relation of tutor aAd pupil was to continue until the latter had completed all the branches of learning taught in the best colleges of the land. The engagement was then formed, to the mutual satisfaction of the parties. C CHAPTER II. WHEN the session for which Mr. Wells had stipulated with the trustees of the academy had closed, (which was in about two months after the contract with Dr. Wylder,) he repaired to Ithe house of the latter, and was duly installed as tutor to Master Wilkins. The ceremony was in sub- stance the following. Dr. Wylder.--"I have had a room built, as you perceive, Mr. Wells, about a hundred paces from my dwelling, to be occupied while giving lessons to my son. Come here, Wilkins, and pay your'respects to your new friend, whom I have selected as your instructor."   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        1 Master Wilkins.- "My father has often spoken of you, Mr. Wells, in such terms as to make me feel easy in your presence. I am glad to salute you, sir, and to promise that I will comply with your wishes, so far as I may un- derstand them. It is said of teachers generally that they have to govern their pupils by a harsh discipline. My aim will be to save you the disagreeable necessity of such a proceeding toward me." Mr. Wells.--'Finely spoken, my lad. You have taken the right view. I desire you to feel easy with me at all times. Your studies will be prescribed, and I shall expect the necessary diligence on your part to prosper in them. I did not come here to play the tyrant, or to astonish you by any great show  of learning. Your father has com- mitted you to my charge in order that I may prepare you for the honorable duties of manhood. He has wealth, which will some day come into your hands; he has a family pride that turns to you for gratification; and I shall direct your mind, step by step, in the channels of knowledge, as your experience matures, so as to render you worthy of his name and his expectations. I hope you will at all times make known any obstacles that may embarrass you in your studies; and it will afford me pleasure to remove them. I am requested by your father to act toward you as though you were my own son, in giving you such advice as I may deem necessary. That task I will endeavor faithfully to execute, and in the mean time to possess your confidence and  friendship.  We now understand each   9 other." Dr. Wylder.--",This interview, and the manner in which it has been conducted, cannot fail to impress my son agree- ably with the adviser to whom I have intrusted his educa- tion. While I am not exactly rigid in the use of forms, I nevertheless like to see such a prevalence of courtesy and respect among all classes as will give dignity to, without impairing the freedom of, social intercourse. From all   &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7248-00000007"/> 12       WILKINS WYDER; OR, that I have seen of you, Mr. Wells, nature has taught you this lesson, and has given you such perfect success in the practice that no effort on your part seems necessary. I only wish that you may communicate to your pupil the secret, so that, when he shall be prepared, in letters and science, to take his place in the world, he may also have the key to its favor by a graceful address. Distant as the time may appear in his imagination, if the dear boy lives, he will soon be a voter and a -responsible citizen. Ten or twelve years to an aged -man seem but as a few months, while to impatient youth they have much the sound of eternity. On this subject I would thank you to instil correct ideas in your pupil. Should he at any time disobey your commands or fail in his duty, I beg that you will promptly inform me." Here the conversation ended. Master Wilkins was in- formed by his tutor that he would expect his attendance at nine o'clock next morning, to begin a plan of study, alnd that he must bring with him all the school-books in his possession. A few words are deemed proper as to the quarters pro- vided for Mr. Wells. He was introduced to the family with marked respect5 and shown to his handsome bedroom, ad- joining which was an apartment for his private study, the windows commanding -a fine view of the landscape at the country-seat of Dr. Wylder, four miles from the village of Hillburg. Mr. Wells rejoiced within himself that he had such a generous patron, who had treated him with a delicacy seldom experienced by tutorg in the families of the rich. He knew that so long as he acted the part of a gentleman, and gave proper attention to his trust, the place he filled would only cease with the majority of his pupil,-eleven years hence. During that time he could save money enough from his liberal salary to render his, old age quite independent. This consideration had a pleasing effect on his spirits as he met his pupil officially for the first time in   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        13 the instruction-room, which was well furnished with chairs, tables, desks, and lounges, even to luxury. Before examining Master Wilkins, to see what progress he had made, Mr. Wells took occasion to lay down a few rules for his direction. The pupil was to appear neatly dressed in the presence of his tutor. tie was to enter the door in a deliberate, genteel manner, with a salutation every morning, and any casual remark he might think proper, showing civility and the taste of a gentleman. ile was authorized to ask. any question concerning his studie, and to apply for aid at any time, in or out of regular instruction-hours. The forms of a school were to be dis- pensed with in regard to silence. A conversation on books, or on any other subject promotive of mental culture, might be at any time raised by the pupil, to be terminated when- ever the tutor signified his desire. At the end of every half-hour there was to be a formal recitation; and at the close of each hour ten minutes were allowed for exercise in the open air, walking, jumping, or climbing ropes and poles in the gymnasium, which had been constructed for the development 5f the muscles, or in handling the bail against the fives-battery. Such was the order of time in study and recreation. The latitude and longitude of Master Wilkins's erudi- tion were then taken,   and found to be very near the shore, that young gentleman not having as yet ventured far on the ocean of knowledge. Mr. Wells at once per- ceived that he was well acquainted with the lessons which had been laid out for him by parental hands. He read with fair discrimination of the sense of the author, but was mainly deficient in the pauses, which afford such won- derful relief both to reader and listener. The beginning was certainly auspicious. Elementary principles were ex- plained as the pupil advanced, and the path was marked out for the studies of a week. Mr. Wells saw a promising 2 .

Dr. Wylder made no inquiries of either how things stood. He had confidence in both, and knew that the proper duties would be discharged. Besides, he had an instinctive delicacy which forbade all supervision, or calling to ac- count, after he had once committed his judgment. It was beneath the dignity of a gentleman to-be prying into mat- ters out of his jurisdiction. He had chosen a tutor for his son; and the conduct of that tutor was not to be influenced by any fear of espionnage or the least manifestation of dis- trust or curiosity. The heart of Dr. Wylder, always alive to honor and kindness, inclined him to draw out what- was really good in others, by leaving them to their own course after he had once reposed confidence. This was a noble decision, and argued a lofty view of human nature, which in the main is more successful than a narrow vigilance, betraying suspicion. Men of sensibility, capable of great performances, are by this appreciative method held in their sphere without any sacrifice of self-respect. They become more fixed and happy in the character demanded by their employment. At the family table, Mr. Wells and his pupil had seats opposite each other. A pleasant conversation was gene- rally carried on, in which all took part, as the topics per- mitted, or as Dr. Wylder and Mr. Wells gave -occasion for reply. There was no painful silence, no cold formality, to mar the social repast. The ladies, from the presiding matron down to the youngest, were included among the talkers. They were delighted with the urbane and intelli- gent Mr. Wells, who always had an original, happy thought addressed to each one, calculated to foster a desire of knowledge and to improve the heart. Master Wilkins did not escape this shower of pearls. He came in for an equal share, that he might feel no preference nor neglect,-that at t    .    ThIE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       15 his father's table all were equally cardd for, not only in comforts to the body, but in the pleasures of the mind. When Saturday came, Mr. Wells heard only the morning recitation from his pupil, and dismissed him until Monday. Dr. Wylder knew that the laws of physical as well as in- tellectual health required a change of labor,--that the bow too long bent would lose its elasticity and its strength. He therefore proposed to Mr. Wells that on Saturday of each week, whenever it was agreeable to him, a chaselwith the hounds, or a fishing-excursion, would be at his com- mand, in which Master Wilkins and others would join with alacrity. Or, if such sports did not suit him, he was re- quested to get up any other little contrivance, according to his own fancy, either in boating, or in shooting small game, or such other amusement as he might prefer. Dr. Wylder remarked that in his younger days he was fond of similar exercises, and he wa* clearly of opinion that they had assisted in giving him his uniform vigorous health.  But, much as he prized the physical training of his son, he begged- Mr. Wells to be governed by his own convenience alone in this matter, and not to engage in a fatiguing recreation merely to swell the number of parti- cipants.. Mr. Wells replied that he had long desired such an opportunity to amuse himself. He had read much about hunting and fishing, but his pursuits had denied him the experience which was now  awaiting him. He confessed that he would make a sorry figure in the chase or with the angling-rod, as he was altogether a novice; yet he would gladly unite in either pastime, and show a willingness to enjoy, even if he could not increase, the trophies. He also added that it was no small accomplishment to sit grace- fully in the saddle 'or to walk with a firm and elastic -step, and he was anxious that his pupil should excel in both respects, to bear himself more successfully when he should take his place in the great drama of human affairs.

Napoleon was v I as much indebted to his frame of iron as to his genius for  the dazzling exploits which astonished the world.  CHAPTER II. d A CLERGYMAN in the vicinity, the Rev. Ezra Holton, was a frequent visitor at the mansion of Dr. Wylder. On  X making the acquaintance of Mr. Wells, he expressed him-  self highly pleased with that gentleman; and it was not  many weeks before a cordial friendship ensued, as may be, judged by the following conversation.          As we talk freely together, Mr. yells, I will  give vou a little of my history, if you will listen to it,-be- - lieving that the happiness of mankind is often promoted  by the experience of individuals; and, as I have no doubt you agree with me in this opinion, I shall the more readily unfold myself.  "You see before you a man in- his forty-third year, of  tolerable health and of marked cheerfulness. The latter  mood, however, is rather the effect of misfortune, strange  as it may seem, than of any constitutional disposition..  After I passed through college with fair success in my  studies, I happened to be present at a military review, where the sight of the major-general and his staff in rich uniforms, and the sound of martial music, fired me with a  pation for war. I realized, in my imagination, all then glory which had been ascribed to heroes in the tented field. J My father soon discovered my choice, and lost no time in  applying to the War Department for a commission in the army. "I soon received the appointment of lieutenant, and  was stationed at Fort  I was then in my twentieth year.6^*                       !   "My command was pleasant enough. Every morning we had music from the band, and a parade for drill-exer- cise. Henjoyed this sort of life about two years, in the mean time renewing my studies in geometry and civil en- gineering, with a view to fortifications in the public service. I also improved my style by the official- reports I had to make out for my senior officer, in which I took care to use as few words as possible to convey my meanmg. On all occasions I tried to cultivate a simple form of speech, at once grave and harmonious, as my ideal of excellence. So far as popularity was concerned, I gave myself no trouble whatever. I resolved to discharge my duty according to my best convictions, and to leave the issue to circumstances. My camp-associates were intelligent and full of hilarity, much more addicted than myself to wine and cards. They often rallied me upon my  'unsophisticated morals' as they called them, and wondered when I would take upon myself the whole armor necessary to complete a mili- tary gentleman. I treated such pleasantry with good nature, and seldom had any disagreeable relations with my comrades. "In about two  years I was ordered to the West, to suppress the Indian disturbances in that quarter. Several skirmishes took place, in one of which I was shot by a .  warrior, his rifle-ball shivering my left collar-bone. I fell lifeless, to all appearance, and was borne off by my men to prevent the Indians from  scalping me. The surgeon staunched the wound, and by proper stimulants awakened suspended vitality. I was two months in the hospital before I was in a condition to resume my command even nominally. In the mean time the Indians had withdrawn to another station, some eighty miles distant, and, at the suggestion of my captain, I obtained a furlough until my health could be fully restored at the mineral springs of Virginia.. Here I received every attention which an invalid could desire.  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7248-00000010"/> 18 .      WILKINS WYDER; OR, ' Among the great number of visitors at the springs was the Hon. Henry Clay. On learning that I was a young officer from the West, he called at my room and did me, the honor to introduce himself. In the most cordial, even parental, manner, he inquired after my health, and spoke flatteringly of my conduct in battle, which he had seen commended in the report of the general to the Secretary of War. It was the first time I had ever seen Mr. Clay. All that I had heard of his winning address and noble qualities was more than verified by this interview. I felt something better than admiration: I loved him. No won-- der that he was the idol of the masses, though he never reached the Presidency. He was too great for the position. The first honor of the Republic is not, of late, bestowed on the most worthy. It is raffled for at conventions and cabals, where ability and patriotism of the first order are quite secondary objects in the game. It would be about as well for the country to draft a President from the multitude capable of bearing arms.  "I continued to suffer from my wound, becoming daily more emaciated, until I had scarcely power to walk. I described my situation, and signified to the Secretary of War that it would be impossible for me to return to the military post with any hope of being useful. That dis- tinguished gentleman wrote me a sympathizing letter, and extended my furlough indefinitely. In about six months I I resigned my commission, and returned to die (as I thought)  among my kindred. I lingered three years between life and  the grave. Gradually my health improved, and I was offered the chair of Mathematics and Astronomy in -- College, i; which I accepted. Whilst occupying this situation, I mar- ried the daughter of a resident clergyman. Our first child we named Celestia, a sweet little girl, who died at the age of four months. I murmured in my heart bitterly at this dispensation of Heaven. My pious father-in-law tried to console me, and ultimately drew my mind from its sor- I i   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.

My experience in the army, and the wound I received from the Indian rifle, the pain of which has never ceased to torment me in my calmest hours, have aroused my sympathies for men who follow war as an occupation. "I remained ten years in the faculty of the college, per- forming such duties as were assigned me, often laborious, but always cheerfully met. After the birth of our child, my wife never again became a mother. My family has been small and prudent,-by which means I saved enough from ny salary to purchase the farm on which I reside. For the last six years I have been an ordained minister of the gospel, assisting by my instructions to prepare my fellow- men for a happier world. "t You have now, Mr. Wells, the substance of my history; and I ought to apologize for inflicting so long a conversa- tion on you. My object has been more to give you a proof of my good opinion than to solicit yours by the narrative. For I ban be at no loss to perceive that you are too good a" judge of character to be influenced by what a man says of himself." Mr. W.-"I am truly obliged by your remarks concerning your past life. They make mo feel at home with you. If my own self-portraiture could interestyou, it would afford me pleasure to give you a sketch; but there is so little variety in my experience, so few occasions to call forth the hero or the sage, that, fondly as I love myself, I doubt whether I possess the high qualities which I so much admire in others. Yet, in return for your kindness, I will say a few things which may interest you. "I was born in Germany  and received my   education there. In my   twenty-ninth year I came to the United States, tand in duo time applied for naturalization, which was granted me  in Soutli Carolina.

I was pleased with the faculty and with their course of instruction; but I had not the courage to do my part in the dissecting-room to acquire a knowledge of anatomy and surgery. The odor was so offensive that I had to retire every time I entered the threshold. I even went so far as to smell prepared salts and drink brandy to fortify my nerves; but all in vain. I could no more remain with my fellow-students at the 'dead- table' than Falstaff could maintain his ground when set upon by Prince Henry, in the counterfeit robbers. "But my time and money were not altogether wasted in this experiment to make myself a doctor. - The acquaint- ance I formed with the professors and students, and with the high-toned society of Charleston more than compen- sated in a kind of knowledge which I very much needed. Up to that time I had been a mere book-worm. My habits changed: I began to take pleasure in conversing with men and in forming business relations. I gave up all preten- sions to medicine as a pursuit, and -was soon invited to the chair of Modern Languages in the University of --, the duties of which I discharged for the ensuing six years, when I xesigned, with most of my salary converted into books, curious engravings, scientific apparatus, and such property as became a bachelor of arts; for I claim that degree in contradistinction to matrimony, which I have never attempted,--though I am a great admirer of the ladies. "On the subject of religion, I have not been able to ar- rive at any point cear of mystery. I reverence the Maker of the universe and his holy word; but I cannot grasp the atonement as you and your brother-Christians declare it. I hope I shall receive light, as I certainly desire to know the truth. My ideas of moral dignity guide me for   the present as an instructor of youth. I give no person cause of offence knowingly, and I strive to do all the good in my power, to all old or young, learned or ignorant, who come within my reach. The mere illusions of fame no longer disturb me. I am resigned to my lot, and take pleasure in the friendship of the virtuous and intelligent. On this footing I am hapy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Holton, and desire that you will at all times feel at liberty to converse with me on such topics as you may deem conducive to our mutual benefit." CHAPTER IV. MASTER WILKINS and his tutor got along pleasantly. together. The industry of the one never fell behind the labor prescribed; nor was that labor either top little or too much for his faculties. Mr. Wells was a con- summate judge of youth, including temperament and all the other traits which constitute individuality of character. He had ever been actuated\by an earnest desire to benefit his pupils and to satisfy his patrons. In this instance, he saw that he had natural powers committed to his caje, in the person of Master Wilkins, which it would be criminal to neglect. Besides, it was the first opportunity he ever had of moulding a mind by his own ideas of success. It was easy to explain to a single learner, hour after hour, day after day, month after month, and year after year, without in- terruption, the reason and principles which lie at the foun- dation of all human knowledge. In a school of twenty, thirty, or fifty pupils, of different capacities, as the case might be, there was no such chance of instruction. The whole was unavoidably imperfect and confused.  Now the test was fairly allowed as to the influence one mind could exertfover another, in full confidence and harmony.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7248-00000012"/> 22       WILKINS WYDER; OR, The method of Mr. Wells in leading Master Wilkins in the right path was the result of great reflection, so well blended with love and authority between tutor and pupil that neither felt the least apprehension of injustice. The commands of the tutor were obeyed implicitly, yet without timid fear. The only fear Master Wilkins knew was that by the omission of duty he might forfeit the good opinion of his tutor, and thereby confidence' in himself,-which confidence, boy as he was, he instinctively regarded as the lever of upward, joyous action. A discourse on successful life might be hinged on this pivot. Mr. Wells was too close an observer, and too conscientious, to allow this idea to escape his plan. It was the key by which he gained admittance at all times into the mind of his pupil, so as to work'upon it as the sculptor reduces the block of marble, by chisel and rule, to the image which he seeks to produce. Mr. Wells saw with pride that Master Wilkins had within him the germ to bring' forth, by judicious culture, the. choicest fruits of intellectual and moral elevation. He therefore advised with Dr. Wylder in a confiding spirit, stating the intellectual promise-of his son, and desired to know what profession or walk in life he d'esigned for him, as it was necessary to keep this object steadily in view, that all proper influences might advance it in the course  of his education.                   :I Dr. Wylder.--"My desire is to qualify my son for happi- ness and respectability on a scale somewhat original in these degenerate times. I would be glad to see in him a model to revive in society, if possible, an appreciation of : that greatness which I regret to know has almost ceased to regulate the conduct of men since the great exemplars of the I Revolution have passed away. v I am aware that you sym- :: pathize with this opinion, and I leave it to your ski'l and X judgment to work out the result. I have wealth and posi- i! tion to bequeath my son, and it remains with you to render   :    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        23 his inheritance a blessing or a curse to him when he shall take his place as a citizen. If you can be so fortunate as to imbue his mind with dignified aims and' high moral re, solutions to sustain himself as a, GENTLEMAN, my hopes will be fully answered. The intelligence and address necessary for this purpose I submit-to your control." iI. Mr. Wells.--"I feel more at liberty by your last remark. Though ever since I have been in your family you have manifested confidence in my judgment as an instructor, I desired an intimation of your will concerning the future of your son, whether he was destined for a profession, or to plant himself on his fortune and accomplishments, to be enjoyed at leisure. You have now enlightened me in Athis respect, and I know precisely the course necessary to pur: sue in order to fulfil your expectations. The means you have placed at my command; and I hold myself responsible for their use in the right direction."' After this brief interview, which was pregnant with great consequences, Dr. Wylder invited Mr. Wells to pass an hour or two in the drawing-rsom for recreation among the ladies of his- family. Thus far no mention has been made of the more interesting part of the household. The task of bringing Master Wilkins to a certain point has now been achieved; and, dismissing him for a short time, several new characters will be introduced, who are to appear from i .time to time in this history. First of all was the graceful Mrs. Wylder, a fit com- panion forher high-minded and energetic husband.  Hier maiden name was Guyon, and her father, Victor Guyon, was a distinguished, leader among the Huguenot families of South Carolina, who proverbially recognise wealth and merit as forming the circle which shuts them in from the rest of mankind.  Once introduced, the new-comer will find a cordial reception from the whole, even though he may have nothing but merit to recommend him; if that be wanting, the only chance for recognition is wealth,-  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7248-00000013"/> 24       WILKINS WYDER; OR, which will be accepted as a substitute. 'Dr. Wylder had the good fortune to scale the barriers on the score of his personal worth, and with hi accomplished bride received a large dowry, which at once set him up as a gentleman in his hos- pitalities and choice of society. The wealth thus acquired he managed with such prudence as to become the largest estate in the county at the time Master Wilkins, the heir apparent, passed into the hands of Mr. Wells. Dr. Wylder and his wife- had two children besides the hero of this story; one, a daughter beautiful to look upon, whose name-Angelina-denoted kinship above. The re- maining pet, little Edward, was about five years old, just beginning to roll his hoops and little wagons, ancdto fire off crackers on the Fourth of July as a demonstration of his future patriotism. On a visit to-the family was an elder sister of Mrs. Wylder, Miss Mary Guyon, who had completed two-score years in single blessedness, obstinately rejecting several offers of marriage, and content to in- dulge her pride and exclusiveness by residing on her ample estate near the seaboard without sharing the confidence or love of any-human being. She was very aristocratic, and but for the respect she entertained for her brother-in- law, Dr. Wylder, she would not have treated Mr. Wells as an equal in the family,--the footing on which he was admitted by all, old- and young. It was contrary to Miss Guyon's ideas of rank that a mere tutor, who was pre- sumed to be poor and without high social position, W&amp;ould sit and converse familiarly with his superiors in the doiestic circle. For her part, her noble proclivities abhorred the contact, and she tossed up her pug-nose in princely scorn. Mr. Wells did not obtrude his civilities upon this sublime personage, but found elsewhere genial scope for his wisdom and refined manners. Dr. Wylder had a niece, Miss Matilda Harris, who had just completed her educational course, and was passing a few weeks under his roof. She was' in feeble health, as if   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        5 oppressed by asthma; yet she was cheerful, and very kind to all around her. She was evidently a religious girl, from her meek brow and gentle words. Whatever sharpness of feeling others might indulge, she uttered no complaint either on account of her afflictions or of fancied neglect. She was the very picture of angelic purity; and with all' the members of the household, except the peerless old maid, the lovely Matilda was  an acknowledged favorite. In another part of this history these ladies, so much in contrast, will be again noticed as they figure in the scene. Though a man of books, somewhat formal in his address Mr. Wells could make himself agreeable in society. Master Wilkins sat near him in the drawing-room, an interested listener. His mind took sides with his tutor in any little controversy which sprung up  either for diversion or to settle any point in literature or science; for, cold'and haughty as Miss Guyon proved herself to be, she enjoyed a sort of malicious pleasure in starting difficult questions for others to solve, although she was really incapable of judg- ing  whether the answers were correct or erroneous. Any expedient by which her own  superiority could be shown, she resorted to, however ridiculous it -made her appear in the sight of others. C  FTAP'1ES V. ABOUT eighteen months had elapsed since Mr. Wells had taken up his abode in Dr lWylder's family. In the mean time, M aster Wlkins had made very com mendable progress in his studies. Htis conduct had been worthy, and he stood high with tutor and parents. It was but reasonable that he should  have a vacation in the sultry months ofrJuly and August. Dr. Wylder suggested to  Mgr. Wells the pro- priety of a  trip to the mountains with his pupil, in order that the latter might behold the majestic scenery and  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7248-00000014"/> 26       WILKIN  WYDER ; OR,         M inhale the bracing atmosphere of that region. They could take a public conveyance, stop when they pleased, and go -wherever their curiosity might lead them. In regard to the expense, Dr. Wylder would feel himself more than compen- sated by having the mind of his son wrought upon by the grand works of nature, his ideas enlarged, and variety given to his tastes, under the guardian eye of his tutor. Mr. Wells cheerfully acquiesced in the plan; and a day was aet apart for the journey. Mrs. Wylder was informed of the arrangement, and busied herself in preparing her son for his travels. In less than a week the post-coach drove up for the passengers. A kind adieu was taken, blessings were bestowed, and the coach bore the loved one frommview. It was the first time, Mrs. Wylder had ever parted from her son for more than a few hours together. But she knew that he was in. safe hands, and therefore felt no painful anxiety. Mr. Wells and Master Wilkins were now upon their first tour together, each confiding in and devoted to the other. , The first town they stopped at was Greenville,-South Carolina. Hiring saddle-horses, they visited the "Table Rok,) some twenty miles distant, from the summit of which they gazed upon the territory of three other States, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Master Wilkins was overwhelmed by the grandeur of the scene. He was informed that Governor Manning and his staff, accom- panied by a band of music and a military escort, had ascended the "Rock," with a piece of artillery, and from its loftiest peak had celebrated the Fourth -day of July. This was quite a feat of courage and patriotism; for it required a cool head and steady nerves to ascend the deli- cate and trembling stairs several hundred feet in an almost perpendicular direction. The landscape, however, at any point of the ascent was magnificent beyond description. Both tutor and pupil imbibed the spirit of nature and were filled with reverence fo'r its Divine Author.   The travellers next proceeded down the French Broad' and spent a week at the W4rm Springs. There Mr. Wells met a gentleman whom he had known in Charleston, Mr. Jacques Rowlett, who had married the daughter of an Associate Justice of the United States. Mr. Rowlett had his family Niith him. His main object was to try the virtues of the warm  bath on his little daughter, whose spine had been weak from infancy. And here let it be recorded that the same afflicted child grew up to woman- hood, gifted with a poetic mind and thorough cultivation, and that onlya few years ago she departed this life, an admired authoress, the music of whose soul still lingers in a thousand sympathizing hearts. From  the Warm Springs Mr. Wells and his pupil pro- ceeded by easy stages through East Tennessee, passing a few  days at some public house on theroad, or in  a village, as inclination prompted. They explored a large cavern by torchght, called "Fowte's Cave," having em- ployed a  guide for the purpose. The formations in this subterranean mansion were curious and wonderful. Read- ers familiar with  Wier's Cave, in Virginia, add the Main- moth Cave, in Kentucky, have an idea of such freaks of nature; for in their principal features they are all much alike, except in the magnitude and structure of some of the apartments. Master Wilkins declared that he had seen more of the grandeur and beauties of nature in a  few weeks than he could have imagined from years of reading. Mr. Wells improved the occasion to give his pupil a few hints on geology, the component strata of the globe, the agencies by'which it assumed its present form, and the changes constantly going on as demonstrated by science. Rocks of different varieties were collected and classified, merely to show what the pupil would be required to understand when his age and preparation were sufficient for the study. In all this Master Wilkins manifested a lively interest, asking questions whenever he saw a cti- &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7248-00000015"/> 28       WILKINS WYDER; Oa, rious rock or flower., Mr. Wells was delighted at the inquisitive turn of his pupil, and gave him explanations in so simple a manner that his tender mind was encouraged to look upon all things in nature as admitting of an intelli- gible solution. Frequent rambles were taken in the cool of the day in search of specimens both in geology and, botany. By this mI ethod Master Wilkins improved more rapidly than if he had been reciting to his tutor at home. Therewas a large military parade at -Bean's Station, in East Tennessee, which Mr. Wells and his young friend at. tended in order to see the hardy yeomanry of the State. The regiment was said to consist of twelve hundred militia. It was reviewed by the general officers, some of whom looked well enough; but the rank and file appeared to be the roughest specimens of humanity which could be found in the State. They were clumsy in figure, ugly in features, stolid in countenance, and dressed in the most singular style in yellow, blue, purple, brown, white, black, and all the colors which could be invented at home, to show off domestic skill to the best advantage,--as each good mother, wife, or sister, who spun and wove the clothing, tried to excel her neighbor in the beauty and richness of her dyes. Hence the singular competition and variety. There was one trait, however, not to be overlooked in these untaught children of the mountains. The Governor had ordered three companies of ninety men each to be raised to fight the Indians. If the men volunteered well; if they refused, a draft was to follow. While the regiment was in line, a young gentleman who officiated as adjutant (Major Cocke) rode in front, announcing himself as a volunteer, and called upon those who were willing to serve their country to fall into ranks after the music and flag. In- stantly there was a rush to the standard. The companies were more than filled. Illiterate and repulsive as the back- woodsmen appeared to Mr. Wells, he was forced to admire their patriotism. They went to the war and gave a good   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        29 account of themselves, The work of the day laid the foundation of Major Cocke's popularity, as" he has since been elected a major-general of militia, and also a Repre- sentative in Congress.    N In- about three weeks after leaving home, Mr. Wells wrote the following letter to Dr. Wylder:--  "KNOXVILLE, TEN., Aug. 4, 18- DEAR SIR:--By this time you no doubt feel anxious to hear from us. I have the satisfaction to say that the health of your son has improved daily in our travels. He is robust and cheerful, a close observer, and is delighted with the mountains, the first view of which, like a bank of dark cloud in the distance, (the Blue Ridge,) impressed him with awe at the majesty of nature. "While going down the margin of the French Broad, with scarcely a path wide enough for the haqk, Master Wilkins was often alarmed at the prospect of being turned over in the roaring torrent. But at length he became quite fearless, and made less complaint than several of the other passengers. lie w  as much pleased with the high cliffs under which we passed, often desiring the driver to rest his horses, in order that a better view might be taken. A place called the 'Chimneys,' six hundred feet in perpen- dicular height, of variegated rock, very much interested him. He also enjoyed our visit to the cave, which we ex- plored half a mile by torchght. Of these wonders he will have much to relate when he sees you. "The largest collection of people Master Wilkins ever saw  was at Bean's Station, for military purposes. I in - formed him that the place took its name from  a notorious ruffian, of whom he had read in the Life of General Jack- son in your library, with a picture representing the scene. Russell Bean, in a drunken frolic, out off the ears of his infant child, for which offnce he was indicted by the grand jury. He was in the court-yard at Jonesborough, where  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7248-00000016"/> 30       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Judge Andrew Jackson hold his first court, but refused to be taken by the sheriff and his posse. On learning the fact, the judge volunteered his service, held a pistol in each hand, and advanced upon the outlaw, who immediately surrendered his weapons. Bean then lived in a log cabin, where an Indian agency was established; and from this circumstance the 'Station' derived its name. Wilkins remembered the story, and artlessly observed that it was the first spot he had ever-seen represented by a picture in a book. "The dear boy was soon gratified with an opportunity to behold the original of a likeness which he had often seen in the 'National Portrait-Gallery,' a copy of which is on your centre-table. The day we Arrived here, we saw at the hotel a number of persons shaking hands with a small elderly gentleman of rather striking physiognomy, who seemed from the attention paid him to be a general favorite. His hair was about half gray, and hung down his shoulders. I inquired who he was; and, without men- tioning his name, I took Wilkins aside, atnd told him that a the dignified-looking old gentleman he saw was a candidate for President of the United States, andsthat;his portrait he had frequently seen. This excited his .curiosity; and he could hardly credit his good fortune in standing near so great a- personage, gazing upon him with his own- eyes. The idea possessed Wilkins that to appear in a book, with a memoir and likeness, was immortality itself. He begged me to relieve his suspense; and I informed him that it was I the Honorable Hugh Lawson White, a Senator in Congress,  and - one of the purest patriots of the age. Wilkins was evidently disappointed. He imagined that a great man  would look different from other people. In this respect he has much to learn; and his future happiness will be greatly  influenced by the use which may be made of the incident  here noticed. The ideal of things in advance, and the s   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        31 reality, when proved, do not harmonize once in a thou- sand instances. This you and I know from experience. "We shall probably return home in three or four weeks from this date. Say to Mrs. YWylder that her son is much pleased with his travels and sght-seeing, and that he has a budget of fancies for her acceptance, to be delivered in person.       Most respectfully, THEO. WELLS." CTdAPTER VI. DURING the absence of tutor and pupil from the Wylder mansion, it seemed that the very spirit of insubordination ruled in the family. Whether the presence of "Massa Wilkins," with his beaming face and kind words, was ne- cessary to keep the servants in good humor and to make them fill their places with alacrity, cannot be affirmed; but the coincidence is, at least worthy of note, that, while the young master was away, the house-menials began to grow surly, and to neglect their duties in so marked a degree that most of them had to be dealt with,-s e yielding to remonstrance, and others required a more tangible argu- ment to convince them of error and to reform it. The old gardener, Uncle Phil, was deeply mortified at the conduct of his younger fellow-servants, who held offices of honor in the establishment, viz., Big Jim, master of the horse and stables; Charles, director of the carriage and master of door-ceremonies; Bill senior, overseer"of the wood-pile and driver of oxen; Bill junior, messenger to the post- office, and guardian of horse and gig; Dinah, chief cook; and governess of the kitchen; Jenny, aid to the chief cook, and drawer of water; Lettice, leader of the wash-tub; Lorette, mistress of "the bedchamber and of needle ecq-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7248-00000017"/> 32       WILKINS WYDER; OR, nomy; Pauline and Reuben, waiters on the table. Sudh was the corps of subordinates at Wylder Hall. Now, it was easy enough for each of these functionaries to do what was prescribed in his or her sphere. There ! was no invasion of boundaries,--no excuse for omitting duty on the ground that Joe expected Jake or that Sall thought Moll was going to do this or that work. The labor of each was marked with a view to the capacity, bodily and mental, of the servant. Each bad a careful training, and was abundantly fed, clothed, and lodged. The family discipline was not more rigid than the well-being of the household demanded. Dr. Wylder had more trouble on his hands than all his servants put together; for he was compelled to mok after their welfare as well as his own, and to provide for all the members of his family as became his station. Order was at length restored among the ser- vants, and all went on smoothly as iasual. The report that young "Massa Wilkins" was coming home soon inspired them with joy. But by far the most serious transaction was mutiny in the parlor, where Miss Guyon held her court. This lady had at length been persuaded, either by relatives or by i her own sense of propriety, to accept a lover ofsome kind, and not to pass all her life in maidenly solitude. To bring  within the circle of h6r charms a more extended acquaint- ance, Dr. Wylder proposed to his sister-in-law to give a  large party at his house at such time as would be agreeable ! to her. . The list of invitations was left mostly in her  charge. The party was resolved upon, and the time fixed. Dr. Wylder was a fashionable man, and desired to render. the occasion both notable and pleasant. He ordered his grocer to supply every thing without regard to expense.  When it was necessary to issue the tickets, Dr. Wylder glanced- over the names which Miss Guyon had added to his own list, and saw -that of Dr. Charles Ringford, a young exquisite who had recently settled in the village of Hill- - v   ,                   .   'fi  THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        33 burg. His habits were notoriously irregular, as Dr. Wylder informed Miss Guyon; and he requested, as a personal favor, that his name might be omitted. All the other names were to his satisfaction; but, if Dr. Ringford came to the party, he, Dr. Wylder, would be under the necessity of acting as he had never done before in his own house, by declining to introduce a guest. He would not assume the responsibility of endorsing a character of such doubt- ful merit. liss Mary Guyon, of two score years, thought she was of an age to exercise her own judgment, without the dic- tation of any guardian. Unless Dr. Ringford was invited, she would not appear in the drawing-room or accept any, share in the party. In these terms she expressed herself to her brother-in-law, whom she left at liberty either to include the objectionable name or to destroy the list alto- gether so far as she had disfigured it. Making no further resistance, the doctor yielded to his fair relative. Mrs. Wylder had taken no part in the discussion; but she gently intimated a wish that the part)y might be de- layed until her son's return, which would be in two or three weeks at furthest. Then there would be a new cause for rejoicing in the family, besides affording Wilkins a chance to see many new faces that would kindly beamn on the heir of the house improved by his travels. To this proposition Miss Guyon. turned a deaf ear. If she was to be honored, let the compliment be undivided.  When Master Wilkins reached an age to value such a  proof of parental generosity, it would be time enough to bring him into special notice. She would not compromit her dignity by sharing with a boy nephew any display of fashion and intelligence such as sheexpected to signalize the forth- coming party. To her mind, the object was very plain. Dr. Wylder had opposed a  certain invitation.; and now his sympathizing wife  must show her art in the form of delay to break up the entertainment, or to rob it of all its eclat &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7248-00000018"/> 34       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Mrs. Wylder protested her innocence of any design; on the contrary, she wa  Inxious to respect the wishes of her sister and to contribute to her enjoyment. The invita- tionsi were then issued, not omitting Dr. Ringford. The evening of the party arrived. Wylder Hall was thronged with gay and fashionable guests, among whom, prominent in attire, was Dr. Ringford, who stood -in a corner of the room, unseen by Dr. Wylder while dispensing the honors of host to the rest of the company. Of course the omission was purely accidental, and- Dr. Ringford was not in the least disturbed by it. In the course of the evening, the young doctor and Miss Guyon were prome- nading the room together, in lively conversation. Who introduced them has never been known; for it was certain they were not acquainted until that evening. All that Miss Guyon knew of Dr. Ringford was that she had seen him at churchand had been favorably impressed by his gentlemanly manners and superior taste in dress. The utmost that Dr. :Ringford had ascertained about Miss Guyon was that she was*rich, and spenVtmuch of her time in the family of Dr. Wylder. The invitation he looked upon as fortunate, enabling him to "bamboozle the old maid," as he was heard to declare many years afterward. A further description of the party or the guests would merely consume the time of the reader. It was quite a successLaffair of the kind, and passed off to the satisfac- tion of all, except Dr. Wylder, who never forgot his rude- ness to Dr. Ringford, and the pleasant social relations which he saw existing between that gentleman and his sister-in-law in the course of the evrening. This proved a canker to his peace of mind. He kept his apprehensions to himself, and maintained his usual serenity. Tri-weekly a messenger was sent to the post-office for the letters and papers of Dr. Wylder, who had instructed the postmaster to pjace in his box all the letters and pamphlets that came by mail addressed to Miss Guyon.   It is possible that Dr. Ringford may have been informed of this convenience by Miss Gvyon on the night of the party. At all events, a correspondence was held between the parties, which began as follows:- M"lY DEAR MSS GUYON:-Though distressed at a want of opportunity at Wylder Hall the other evening to open my heart to' you, I take this method to accomplish my pur- pose, especially as I never received any civilities from Dr. Wylder which would authorize my visits to his house. I then gave you to understand that I could never be happy without your good opinion, for the reason that I never saw a lady whose mind and grace of manner entirely cap- tivated me until I had the honor of being presented to you. Even -now I hesitate to unfold the passion which consumes me. "I beg that you will indulge me in setting myself cor- rectly before you, even though you may not encourage my suit. It will be a pleasure to me through life to know that my history has been breathed to one capable of sympa. thizing with it. I am a native of Virginia, and closely related by blood to President Madison. After finishing my college course at the university of which Mr. Jefferson was the founder, I spent several years in Europe, where I had access to the most cultivated society. Lord Brougham invited me to dinner, and introduced me to the Duke of Wellington, Earl Grey, and other distinguished members of the nobility. I gave such minute information about my own country, its government, agriculture, manmfactures, com- merce, and sectional disputes,-slavery and ant-slavery,- that I was complimented by my august listeners, who de- clared that they had never before beenso fully enlightened on these subjects. "I extended my tour through France, Germany, and Italy, visiting Rome, Florence, and Naples. On my return to the United States, I found that my guardian, who was  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7248-00000019"/> 36       WILKINS WYDER; OR, a merchant in Richmond, had wasted the largest portion of my property in a wild speculation in tobacco. I ob- tained enough to take me through two courses of medical lectures in Philadelphia and to pay my ordinary expenses until I can succeed in the practice. I am here for that pur- pose. If your gentle heart can be interested in the destiny of one so unfortunate, I shall esteem it a very great honor to receive a note from you. I can have no repose until my anxiety is relieved: therefore, prolong not the torture of your deoted          CHAS. RINGFORD."' It had been customary with Miss Guyon to show hedr letters to her sister, as they were all from the family connections; but this time she departed from the rule, inasmuch as the epistle was not from a relative. Had it reached the know- ledge of Dr Wylder, he would have blown up the "Vir- ginia" gentleman effectually, and averted the mischief which was soon to fall upon the large and influential Guyon family. Miss Guyon prided herself on her discrimination of character. She had -been previously approached by artful admirers, and once came very near falling into the srfare. But her good fortune, and the vigilant eye of a friend, preserved her on that occasion. She now had more experience, and was fully competent to see through all disguises. -In the confidence of her wisdom, defying the cruel insinuations of her brother-in-law against Dr. Ring- ford, she thus replied to the latter gentleman:- "SIR:-You have given me a proof of your esteem for which I am grateful. What you have been pleased to say in my behalf I can return with large interest by congra- tulating you on the marked courtesies of Lord Brougham and his noble dinner-guests. I doubt whether any private Ameriqan gentleman has ever before received such peculiar attentions. As to your misfortune in the loss of property   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       37 from the misconduct of your guardian, I think you are entitldd to praise for bearing it so calmly. Most wealthy heirs would have been driven to some rash extremity and lost in vice. You have held up with manly courage, and I honor the exploit. My friendship can never be refused to such a claim. If this assurance can add to your happi- ness, you have it in the utmost sincerity. "I did not understand your -letter as desiring any further declaration. On this point you are at liberty, if so inclined, to consider my wealth and position as no barrier to your hopes. I should lose my own self-respect if, admiring as I do your good qualities, I should refuse to hear any further statement from you. I beg that you will treat this note in confidence, and give your reply as much the appearance of having been sent by mail as you possibly can. Without such precaution, our correspondence might be suspected, -which, for the present, I desire to avoid in Dr. Wylder's family.       With due respect, yours, M. GUYON." The reader can imagine with what joy Dr. Ringford de- voured this communication. His trap had already caught the prey. That Madison blood and Brougham dinner had won the rich old maid. She only waited for a committal on his part to reciprocate the favor. The ardent Virgin- ian thus sent back his passion:- 'iDEAREST MSS GUYON:-Whatever fate may have in reserve for me, I shall never cease to value my judgment in perceiving in you that high measure of perfection which alone could have brought me in a suppliant attitude to your sex. I still distrust my hopes; but I will no longer trifle with them. I love you far beyond the power of lan- guage to express: it is my first love, and it shall be my last. If you consider me worthy, and will accept my fidelity, my heart, my hand, and all my future, and will 4  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7248-00000020"/> 38       WILKINS WYDER; OR, ratify this sacred relation at the altar, you can easily ac- complish it by giving-me notice when and where-I can meet you in the vicinity with license and magistrate. We shall then defy the opposition of those who, either deficient in heroic virtue themselves, or unable to appreciate it in' others, have placed themselves across our path. I shall yet have the satisfaction of convincing all such that their judgments are as defective as their hearts are sordid. That I have been misrepresented to you, is certain; but I forgive the motive, because I am bound to respect it, knowing that I am comnparatively a stranger here, andi that I have taken no pains to publish those facts which I, have intrusted to you -for my vindication. A note from you immediately, stating particulars, will complete our mutual happiness. We can then proceed to the coast, or to the mountains, just as you may prefer, until our mar- riage shall cease to be the theme of public gossip. Once under my protection, you will be secure from all annoy- andel. I am too thoroughly versed in the cole of honor, which is the common law of the Old Dominion, to suffer any epithet or indignity which might wound your pride or my reputation to escape without redress. This is so generally known that I apprehend nothing of the kind will be offered. So calm your nerves, and fly to your ever- faithful             CHAS. RINGFORD." This note reached Miss Guyon late in the afternoon. She appeared at tea without any change of manner. Never very agreeable in her disposition or fond of small talk, she maintained her usual reserve and haughtiness at the family table. This conduct was repeated at breakfast. No agitation betrayed her design. She then penned her last maiden note:- - "DEAREST CHARLES:--Meet me with a carriage this after- noon, at five- o'clock, at the end of Dr. Wylder's avenue, and I am yours ever.         M.-uYIYQN.'    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       39 Punetual to the hour, the lovers met, and before sun- down they were pronounced husband and wife in due form of law. CHAPTER VII. THE inmates of Wylder Hall did not remain gloomy more than two weeks, on account of the rash course of Miss Guyon, before they were gladdened by the return of Master Wilkins. Much was said and much enjoyed on both sides. Parents, sister, little brother, cousin, and all the household, manifested their delight. Tho young tourist was the centre of attraction. Nor was his companion, the tutor, omitted in the genbral display of kindness. It was natural that Master Wilkins should inquire after his aunt Mary, who in her better moods had treated him affectionately. He was grieved to learn that she had thrown herself into the arms of a stranger,- especially the man who above all others was distrusted by his father. The idea that her sister had brought reproach on the family by the circumstance of her marriage, was most dis- tressing to Mrs. Wylder; and Wilkins shared the sorrow of his mother. Dr. Wylder said but little on the subject. He did not choose to lacerate the still bleeding heart of his wife by any expression as to the conduct of his sister-in- law.  He knew that sooner or later the consequences would be terrible to the pride and happiness of the ancient family of the Guyons; and he consoled himself as best he could by the recollection that he had acted a faithful part, which, if heeded in time, would have saved them from the un- happy alliance. But it is time that the promise of Master Wilkins should be unfolded, as he must soon figure in his manhood. He related his adventures in, a very correct and agreeable  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7248-00000021"/> 40       WILKINS WYDER; OR, manner, which greatly delighted his parents, who took every suitable occasion to testify their gratitude to Mr. Wells for his wise counsels and friendly solicitude for the welfare of their son. In a few days the regular studies were resumed, and the school-relation of tutor and pupil was again in active exercise. 'This continued from year to year with increasing profit to the youth. He was soundly taught: there was-nothing superficial in the mind or method of Mr. Wells. In the languages, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Italian, French, and German, the instruction was thorough, and equally so in the exact sciences. A high standard of scholarship had been attained by Master Wilkins in the course of his eight years' pupilage. Within that period his knowledge had been diversified and im- * parted in a way not enjoyed"by many learners. At the end of every two years he was relieved from'the toilsome routine of study. by excursions to other- States in company with his faithful tutor. They had not only visited the principal cities in the North, but had crossed over into Canada, at the Falls of Niagara, and stood upon the battle-fields in that vicinity. They had also been to New Orleans, and even to-Cuba, where they spent several weeks in examining the coffee and sugar estates and fruit-groves of that beautiful island. Mr. Wells had also taken his pupil to the West, through. Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, and to the Falls of St. Anthony, on the Mississippi River. They had seen the site of New Madrid, which was destroyed by the earthquake of February 6, 1812, when the whole Valley of the Mississippi was shaken, to the consternation of its inhabitants. Their travels and scientific explorations had been performed regardless of expense, as Dr. Wylder was abundantly able to afford it, and was resolved to give his son not only the best element- ary education, but also views of life on a broad scale which should serve him to good purpose in the future. The highly-favored pupil had now reached his eighteenth  /   THE SUCCESSFUL' MAN;       41 year, and was all that his father could desire, in morals and in cultivation. Mr. Wells felt it his duty to relinquish his charge, as hise supervision was no longer necessary, and he addressed to Dr. Wylder the following communication:- "DEAR SIR:--It is proper that I should inform you of the completion of all, the studies of your son, and that I now consider him qualified for the duties of mature life, whatever they may be. He has been eight years under my special care, with all the facilities for a thorough edu- q cation. You were pleased to allow me to pursue such course as I deemed best for his intellectual and moral cul- ture. Books, scientific apparatus, and expensive journeys have all contributed to the great end in view,-to make him an accomplished scholar and high-toned gentleman. Such I pronounce your son to be. Without claiming the credit, I have the satisfaction to say that he has reached a point in learning beyond which, for any of the practical pur- poses of life, it is not necessary to conduct him. Indeed, if he is to be advanced in this direction by a tutor, I am not the person to afford him the requisite aid, and must therefore resign him into more competent hands. "Allow me to say that I have passed my time most happily in your household. You have been considerate of my welfare, and nothing but the most uniform kindness have I experienced while I have been with vou and yours. In his tenth year, Master Wilkins, the heir of your, house and the delight of your affections, was placed with me as a pupil. You shared his society while I gave. him instruc- tions to the best of my power. .te has beeA with me in inany interesting journeys, where the paternal eye could not observe him.  I have the great pleasure to say that during all this time he has been docile, truthful, and up- right, winning the love of strangers by his urbanity and correct deportment. Now, in his eighteenth year, whilst his age and qualities'entitle him to a formal prefix, 'Mr. l  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7248-00000022"/> 42       lWILKINS -WYDER; OR, Wylder' I shall never know him by any such designation. To me he can never cease to be 'dear Wilkins,' whatever fortune or dignities may await him. He is qualified for any trust in which his country may demand able and faith-. ful service; and itl11 be the joy of my old age to hear of' his eminent success. His heart is as gentle as his soul is resolute and brave. "In retiring from the charge to which your confidence invited me, I give back your son with a confident hope that he will be a blessing to his country and a source of joy to your declining age. My last office is fulfilled, and I bid you and your family a grateful adieu. "With high respect, THEO. WELLS." This letter was read by Dr. Wylder with sad emotions. Though he knew that his son had reached an age when a tutor was no longer necessary, yet the idea of parting from' Mr. Wells after so long a term in his family was unwel- come. It was like losing a friend whose daily companion- ship had become a second nature. When informed of the event, Mrs. Wylder and all the white members of the, family collected together to hear the farewell of the dear old tutor. Dr. Wylder read it with a trembling voice, and all eyes were dim with tears. There seemed to be a void in their group, which it was painful to contemplate. After a pause to subdue his feelings, Wilkins requested his father to invite Mr. Wells to remain as a friend and guest of the family as long as it suited his convenience; adding that when he (Wilkins) became the owner of a dwelling, his first step would be to offer Mr. Wells a home for life. In this suggestion all present cheerfully concurred. On the appearance of Mr. Wells next morning at the breakfast-table, he received the usual salutation. Except a few commonplace remarks by Dr. Wylder. relative to the weather, no one had the courage to introduce conversa-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       43 tion. Mr. Wells saw the gloom, and was almost over- whelmed by his sensibilities. He managed to get through. the meal with apparent calmness; but his soul could only be relieved bya flood of tears in his room,-a very unusual occurrence with him. Dr. Wylder sent him the following note;- "MY DEAR MR. WELLS :-For the first time in your life, you have caused distress in my family. Wee have read your parting letter with sorrow, and, while we rejoice at the many agreeable things you say in behalf of Wilkins, it gives us pain to sever the relation which hat so long made you feel as one of our number. Your conduct has always been that of a gentleman; and the faithful manner in which you have instructed my son and guided his travels demands of us an expression of sincere gratitude. I beg you to accept it, and to- feel that the mother of your late pupil shares this sentiment equally with me. Poor Wilkins is disconsolate, and cannot give you up. His reverence for your character is only exceeded by the sense of obligation which he must ever feel toward you. Did I not indulge the hope that the request in the closing para- graph of this letter would be granted, I would try to say more; but I cannot trust myself, under my present feelings of dejection, to assure you how agreeable your society has been to ius, and with what sorrow we look to the separa- tion. "Now, my dear sir, for the request, the favor I ask at your hands, which is that you will male my house your home the balance of your life, or as long as it may suit your convenience,-the longer, the moro gratifying to us. All that I have, is at your service, to render you happy. Do not let your room or your chair at table become vacant; but let us live together as friends, and we shall thank you for the privilege.    Yours sincerely, \ ANDREW WYDER."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7248-00000023"/> "       WILKINS WYDER; OR,   ' Mr. Wells had quite a struggle within himself as to the manner of replying to this generous offer. At one time he thought of seeing Dr. Wylder and his family together, and talking over the subject in a way to do his own feel- ings and their kindness adequate justice. But his heart failed him. His decision was communicated in. a few, words:- "MY DEAR DR. WYDER:-My heart thanks you for your noble invitation to remain at home with you for the balance of my life, oi so long as it may suit iny wishes. I leave you Writh regret; and it is only a sense of duty, pointing to another field of labor, that brings me to this resolution.    Gratefully yours, THEO. WEfLS." The word was spoken. That vacancy so much dreaded was now to be realized at table; the chair of Mr. Wells would no longer be filled. At this juncture, Dr. Wylder opened his desk and stated the account of the tutor. He had agreed to pay him one thousand dollars per annum. Of this sum Mr. Wells had drawn precisely half, which answered his purposes from time to time, and there was a balance of four thousand dollars yet due. Dr. Wylder counted over thi- sum, and added one thousand dollars more, which he begged Mr. Wells to accept for the extra trouble to which he had been subjected in accompanying his son on his long journeys. Mr. Wells hesitated, saying that he was amply rewarded by the eight thousand dollars he had received under the contract; but, perceiving that Dr. Wylder would be mortified at the refusal, he folded it up with the balance, after signifying his warm appreciation of the favor. The carriage drove to the door, at which the baggage of Mr. Wells was deposited. Then came the parting scene. With utterance absolutely choked, and tears trickling  . e   *   UrVJUO-YIJ! U J 1M1ANL  down his face, Mr. Wells advanced to Dr. Wylder and shook him cordially by the hand. The same act was repeated to Mrs. Wylder, Miss Angelina, Miss Harris, and Master Edward. The beloved pupil was standing by, drowned in tears. As Mr. Wells turned toward him, he threw his arms around his neck, and said, "God bless you, my ho- nored tutor, my true friend! I shall never forget your kind- ness! Farewell!"The embrace was warmly returned by Mr. Wells, who utteied, "Noble boy! you deserve well: you will have your reward." And then, stepping into the car- riage, Mr. Wells soon disappeared from the gaze of his weeping friends at Wylder Hall.    " CHAPTER VIII. THE next thing to be settled at Wylder Hall was how Wilkins should best enjoy himself after his long educa- tional training. He had grown to his full stature,--five feet eleven inches: his figure was symmetry itself, active and graceful. His style of beauty was all that skilful judges would require in a man of talents, -a Roman nose, large, handsome mouth, and keen 'blue eyes deeply set in his head: Other features were also good,-the chin a little sharp, and the cheek-bones prominent,-all animated by a most expressive countenance, in which firmness and good nature were equally blended. His hair was of a dark lead- color. Such was Wilkins Wylder at the age of nineteen, now no longer Master Wilkins. This familiar style of address will henceforth' be discarded in this veritable history. Wilkins was furnished with a pair of horses and a light barouche, and, a servant to attend him wherever he pleased to go. As summer came on, Je made up his mind to visit sundry watering-places, and to be present at the college corn- l  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7248-00000024"/> '46       WILKINS WYDER;. OR, :mencements. He carried out this plan, rmuch to his satis- faction, and was quite in request among the fashionables, who -saw that he was a young man worthy of respect, and there- fore courted his favor. There is no doubt that many a bright eye glanced at him with selfish aim, to make him a captive, many an artful compliment was paid him by fair ones, with the hope of conquest. But they knew not the philosophic nature of our hero,-how fixed his purpose to reject allythe whispers of love and the fascinations of beauty until he should have made his mark in the world. ;He had disciplined his reason to lek upon affairs of the heart as very silly things when in the way of a great pur- pose; and, consequently, he was at all times proof against the assaults of Cupid. The mischievous little god might hurl 'his darts until doomsday, without penetrating the bosom of Mr. Wilkins Wylder. Thus m ch has been deemed necessary to account for the cooless and self- command with which he deported himself amid the great affairs of life, as shown by his subsequent career, "Suc- cess at all hazards" was his motto; and to gain his point he never yielded to opposition, come in what form it might. Dr. W ylder was justly proud of his son, and congratu- lated himself upon the wise plan ofhis education -separate from the vicious tendencies of college life as it had ben represented to him. No graduate was better skilled in the languages or in natural philosophy, or possessed more ,of the graces which books could impart under the eye of the wisest of tutors. He frequently consulted with his son-and gave him sound advice, the substance of which was to resolve on success at all hazards in what- ever he undertook. It was presumed that his innate sense of honor would restrain him from unworthy enterprises or improper objects; but when his mind was once made up he was never to turn aside until the -prize was gained. This was the test of true manhood and nobility of cha. k   THE BUUCCESSU L, MAN..      4Ti racter, He that would temporize, or permit himself the diverted from his course, was less than a man, and w either to be pitied for his weakness or despised for his cowardice. Caesar, Bonaparte, and Jackson were the best examples of energy and firmness which the world had ever seen. In this vein, always stimulating his ambition, Dr. Wylder exercised his influence to form the character of his son. He told him that life was a struggle, in which the strodg prevailed over the weak, regardless of the ties of humanity. For himself, while he regretted these things, he was dis- posed to make the most he could out of the accidents of fortune. He reminded his son that he would soon attain his legal age, when he could vote, hold office, and enjoy the privileges of a citizen, released from parental authorityj --that he had expended large sums of money in preparing him to act his part well,--and that his fondest hopes were enlisted in his behalf through all the future. It was im-p portant to begin his career with such presage of victory that men could readily see that it would be against their interest, as it would be fruitless, to oppose him. For instance, a seat in the Legislature was the first thing to be secured. Courting the people was the only method of success. Fine speeches or dignified courtesies would nriot answer. Many voters-even a majority-were incapabl\e of appreciating argument or good breeding. 'They were illiterate, vulgar, and fond' of excitement; and whoever treated them most was sure to gain their votes. How could the people be otherwise, in the absence of any system of popular education? Ignorance and vice were twin- brothers. For this fact neither Dr. Wylder nor his son was responsible. It was their right, however, to make this general misfortune tributary to their own advancement; and. perhaps in this way the, public might be usefully served. At all events, as soon as he was eligible he wished his son to be a candidate for the Legislature, and he wanted to see      , -     '    &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7248-00000025"/> 48       WILKINS WYDER; OR, him elected; There must be no: failure: success was the watchword. Mr. Wilkins Wylder would be a few months over twenty-- one years of age when the- election was to come on. He declared himself a candidate, without consulting any cabal of politicians, or any leader of the party to which he belonged. He visited all the courts and muster-grounds, and all other assemblages of the people, of which he was i notified, in the county. At every place he had some half- dozen expert and active men to huzza for him, and to invite the people to partake of the treats of Mr. Wylder, which were furnished at all the liquor-shops at his expense. The candidate rendered himself agreeabl to the multitude by offering to drink with them, and by cultivating their acquaintance in this pleasant way. He usually said, "Gentlemen, come up and join me in a glass of pure corn- juice,-the healthiest drink to be had. Come, all of you, and see what fine liquor our friend Mr. Drizzle has to-day. Here's wishing you all good luck, full corn-cribs, and "  plenty to' go upon." Then followed a scene of gabble, shaking of hands, -tapping on the shoulders, knowing winks, and all the electioneering signs which adepts in the art so well understand. This was the maiden speech of Wilkins Wylder,- the rich yo/ung ,candidate. To be ssure, the speech itself was contemptible enough, by the action which -it invited; but it was a successful speech: it took with the voting masses, the rulers of the country,-the patriotic consumers of whiskey, which in that day formed the controlling element in elections! The reader must not suppose that Mr. Wylder was left to run the race alone. He had a competitor in Orville Judkins, Esq.; who was some ten years older, and of great ability and excellent character. Mr. Judkins was a temperance lawyer, and refused to treat. 1Hi told the people that he had - too much respect- for them to believe that their votes could be influenced by bald-faced -whiskey   THE' SUCCESSFUL MAN.       49 or any other intoxicating drink. They were all acquainted with him, had frequently heard him argue cases in the court-house, and knew whether or not he was capable of re- presenting them in the Legislature. He would be glad to receive votes enough to elect him; but, if he was compelled to drown the senses of the people with whiskey in order to gain their support, he would prefer being left atpome with a clear conscience rather than take the oath prescribed in the State Constitution, that he had not obtained his election by bribery, canvassing, or other undue means, used by him- self, or by others with his consent. Besides this, he would not sacrifice his self-respect by poisoning, his neighbors and countrymen, and setting temptation in the way of the young, who were soon to take our places in the affairs of government. He was willing to address the people on any subject-such as internal improvement, banks, public schools, or any system of taxation-in which they were interested; and he had proposed to meet his competitor on the stump, who had thought proper to decline all public discussion. Mr. Judkins said he was fully aware of the means used to defeat him,-the flood of whiskey which had been turned loose in the canvass to win votes. He also knew that his opponent had wealth and a strong family influence to back him; and, better than all, he was an educated gentleman, of polished manners and friendly heart. He had not a word to say against him as a man; and it remained with the voters of the county to decide between them, whiskey on the one side and temperance on the other; for this issue had been effectually t'e iered. As to their qualifications, he presumed the people would be as much benefited by the services of one as of the other in the Legislature. At every gathering where Mr. Wylder treated, there was sure to be a disturbance, general drunkenness, much pro- fane swearing, and several fights, in one of which a danger- ous wound was inflicted by stabbing. Though it had been D         5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7248-00000026"/> 50       WILKINS WYDER; OR, customary in the county at previous elections for candidates to treat, there had never been such a profusion of liquor, and never so much mischief. The fact had become painful to the more reflecting citizens; and no man knew when his life was .safe on such occasions. Mr. Wylder was looked upon as the cause of this great evil; and it was finally agreed that the Rev. Mr. 1Iolton, a neighbor and personal friend of Mr. Wylder, should bring the matter to the attention of that gentleman, with the hope that he would change his policy. Accordingly, Mr. Holton waited on Mr. Wylder, when the following conver- sation took place. Mr. .--"I have called upon you, Mr. Wylder, at the request of a number of gentlemen, some of whom are your personal and political ofriends, to make a representa- , tion to you, which I hope you will receive in all kindness, in regard to the pending canvass." Mr. W.--"Knowing that you do not mingle with politics, Mr. Holton, and that your relations with my family have ever been agreeable, I will certainly hear you with respect, even should it turn out that your message has afforded me no pleasure." Mr. ZJ.-{:With your aspirations I have noting to do; nor do I represent any persons who desire you to with- draw from the contest. I believe it was generally expected that you would be a candidate, from the prominence of your family and the superior educktion you had received to prepare you to figure in public life. But the object of my visit is in relation to your practice of treating, by which so much immorality and violence have been occasioned among the rough, ignorant classes, who, though potent at the bal. lot-box, form a very degraded part of every 'community. Several bloody fights have already taken place; and one poor fellow, the head of a helpless family, has been stabbed so as to endanger his life. In view of these' unhappy results, can vou not reconcile it Nwithy your'sense of duty to   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       51 abandon this unfortunate custom of treating, and let the canvass proceed without it?" Mr. W.--"In principle I am entirely opposed to treating in elections; but it has been the custom heretofore; and I have generally noticed that the candidate whlo treated the most bountifully was apt to be elected, whether qualified or not. I have just attained the age of a citizen, and my inclination and happiness point to public life as my future destiny. It has been the aim of my father, in a long course of mental discipline whichl he provided for me at great expense, to prepare me for this sphere; and I am resolved upon success at all hazards.  Such is my motto. I regret to find it necessary to stupefy the minds and corrupt the morals of ,the people to gain their votes; but it must be done, or I shall never be elected. Whilst the sovereign people, whose voice declares all tlings, from a constable to a President, are so fond of whiskey, and are willing to regard that man as their best friend wlv gives them thre most of it to drink, it would be unkind to withhold from them the gratification, and unjust to myself not to profit by their infatuation. I can- , . not, therefore, yield to your friendly request in the matter." Mr. H.-"I regret; Mr. Wylder, to hear your decision. I have performed my duty to others in making known this request; and I now add a few words on my own account. On the score of expediency you have announced your deter- fomakniation, and the argument is so far good; but there is a consideration far above expediency,--that ofprinciple. You admit that it is morally wrong to deprive men of theipr reason, and to debase their passions. How, then, -can you justify yourself before the majesty of Heaven, which "you are daring when you decoy poor erring mortals to their ruin both of body and soul? Do you not fear a day of reckoning-- " Mr. W.-"Come, Mr. Holton; forbear pressing that view of the subject, if you please. Much as I respect you, I cannot listen privately to denunciations which I am willing to hear J   &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7248-00000027"/> 52       WILKINS WYDER; OR, from the pulpit when levelled at vice generally. I am to be the judge of my own actions, as I shall have to answer for them here and hereafter. A few words will suffice. I find men depraved, selfish. My very soul loathes thlem-I mean those who are low and profligate in their lives. If they had virtue, or independence, or even common decency, I would be willing to trust myself to their suffrages with- out any outside influence. Nay, I should despise myself if I even thought of damaging their minds to gain their favor. But, unless some scheme of public education can be devised to improve the young race, our country will be always afflicted with and governed by such trifling cha- racters. I am only steering in the channel which has been marked out for me by all my predecessors. As yet I have not sufficient skill as a pilot to take my vessel into new waters. After this voyage I may possibly throw whiskey overboard. Not now." Mr. W.--"I had no design of wounding your sensibili- ties, Mr. Wylder, by the allusions to which you except. I shall return with the answer you have given, and leave the consequences upon yurself. I know you to. be a well-bred gentleman,-if not religiously inclined, at least courteous to those who are. I have no doubt of your election: the signs are strongly in your favor; and it is probable that your liberal mode of treating has over- whelmed your competitor, who is a rigid temperance man, and in all respects worthy of success. Allow me to indulge the hope that, after taking your seat in the Legis- lature, you will originate some plan to help the people out of their intellectual darkness. This done, you will no longer be under the necessity of treating. Your claims will be recognised without any such agency." Mr. W.--"Whatever I may do, or attempt to do, in the Legislature for the cause you recommend, I can make no promise. First of all, I am not yet elected; and, even if I were, it would be rather pert in so young a man to lead off     ,            .         5 JL4 -Ed J3 UjV Ai t .1 *IO on the question; for it must be managed adroitly to suc- ceed at all. Yet what I may devise, you shall witness." Here the gentlemen parted in a friendly spirit. The treating continued, and so did the fights; but nobody was killed. Mr. Wylder was elected by a large majority, and thus verified his motto of Success at all hazards. CHAPTER IX. ABOUT two weeks before the election spoken of in the last chapter, there was a most aggravated crime committed in the county. An old man by the name of Ratliif Naylor, the owner of a snug property, and supposed to be some- what of a miser and to have a large sum of gold in his house, was found murdered in his bed. He lived alone, his children having all married and left his habitation. The coroner's inquest held over the body, on the 16th day of September, 18-, returned that thedeceased came to his death by a blow on the head with an axe, or other deadly weapon, inflicted by some person to the jury un- known. Search was diligently made, without any discov6ry of the perpetrator. On the day of election, a voter came up to Mr. Wylder and by way of compliment asked him for a ticketias he wanted to vote for him, saying that one good turn deserved another, and, as Mr. Wylder had once done him a favor, he would now pay it back. Mr. Wylder looked at him atten- tively, and recognised him as a low creature who at a public barbacue, on Thursday, 15th September, had produced t half-gallon jug with two handles to it, and requested him to have it filled with whiskey. A verbal order was given- to this effect, to the grocer, and the man marched off, highly elated with his prize. The individual who addressed Mr. Wylder on the d ay of 5:..  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7248-00000028"/> 54       WILKINS WYDER; OR, election was tolerably well dressed,-much better than per- sons of his stolid countenance and uncouth movements usually are. His whining voice, pug-nose, and a defective eye were the main things which Mr. Wylder recollected as being identical with the features of the man who had the brown jug with two handles. The grocer who had filled the jug happened to be within hearing when the man asked for a ticket, and in a playful manner, such as any voter can, on election-day, safely use toward a candidate, observed to Mr. Wylder that the good quality of his whiskey bad so pleased the pug-nosed man that the latter- felt bound in gratitude to make his acknowledg- ments. The grocer's name was Urban Oldfield. After voting, he returned to his store. Within an hour, a man called for a drink. A bottle was placed before him, and, after tasting the contents, he remarked that the liquor had the smell of juniper-berries, such as he had noticed, at the request of the coroner, to proceed from a two-handled jug which was found under the doorsteps of old man NTaylor, on the morning that the inquest was held. A ray of light darted through the mind of Mr. Oldfield, who said nothing of his suspicions until he met the coro- ner, to whom he related the adventure,-how that at .the barbecue, on 15th September, he had filled a two-handled jug for a man who was then dressed in rags, and that he had seen the same person since in expensive clothing, en- tirely new from head to foot. His name was Jacob Bow- man. He was a wandering vagabond, sometimes pretend- ing to work a few days or a week, and always quitting just as soon as he could get a few shillings to buy whiskey. The coroner, Hardy Cummins, kept his eye on Bowman, and determined to trace out appearances. The coat was a dark mulberry mering,-rather an unusual color;-and must have been purchased in some large clothing-store iAot far off. Mr. Cummins visited the city, about fifteen miles distant, and had' a word of conversation in the several   TIIE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      55 clothing-houses. He wished to ascertain when, and to whom, a certain coat was sold, and what kind of money was paid for it, as far as could be recollected. Mr. Cum- mins told them that he had an object in view, but did not then feel at liberty to disclose it. \ In-a few days he would call upon them again, accompanied by the man who wore the coat, and if any of them could identify it they would please give him a sign. On pretence that he wanted a driver for his two-horse wagon to. take a load of late fruit to 'the city, Mr. Cummins hired Bowman, who went with the fruit, delivering a parcel at the clothing-stores, who were customers of Mr. Cummins, chosen for the occasion. Two stores were visited without any recogni- tion of the coat or the wearer. In the third store, as Bowman delivered a quantity of fruit from the wagon, one of the clerks beckoned Mr. Cummins into the back-room, and told him that he had sold the coat to the man then with him. He also remarked that he yet had one of the bills he received for the coat. It was for ten dollars on the "Drovers' Bank of Kentucky."  At the time it was offered, he objected, as it was, not bankable in the city; but the man, who seemed to be much in need of clothes, stated that he had taken it for work, and that the mule- traders would be very glad to give other money for it in the winter. The bill was then accepted.  a, Every thing was yet still,-no alarm given. Mr. Cum- mins asked permission to take the bill with him, which was granted. Bowman then mounted his wagon and drove home. As much depended on the identity of the bill, Mr. Cummins went forthwith to Frank Naylor, a son of the murdered man, and inquired what kind of money his father had,--whether there was any particular bill or mark by which he would know any of it, were it shown to him. He replied that during the winter before, his father bought a couple of mules of a Kentucky drover, and paid for them in large bills, which required change. The drover  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7248-00000029"/> 56       WILKINS WYDER;j OR, said he lacked ten dollars of having enough change in Southern money, and would be compelled to give him a ten-dollar bill on the "Drovers' Bank of Kentucky," at Louisville, which was perfectly good, with the understand- ing that if he passed through the neighborhood on his return, be would take it up, or, at all events, the next winter he would be in again with another drove of mules, and would then make it right. Old Mr. Naylor received the bill on these terms. The drover went home by another way, and the bill remained on hand at the time of the old man's death. Mr. Cummins requested Frank to describe the Kentucky bill as well as he could recollect. He said it had a blue back, with the word "Ten" in a half-circle. On its face there was the figure of a short-horned cow, with a calf lying down at her feet, and two race-horses and riders under full speed. The name of the President was "J. Gutter,"--a curious kind of name, which his father and himself noticed particularly, and jokingly said it was owing, no doubt, to the gutting which had to be dote at the. Bank for the accommodation of the drovers. Mr. Cummins then showed the bill, with all these marks upon it, except the President's name, which was "J. Guthrie," but written in such a way as to resemble "Gutter." Frank Naylor turned pale as he identified, the bill, and demanded light. The secret was then divulged, in confidence, not to be whispered until steps had been taken to bring the of- fender to justice.  Bowman was sneaking about, too lazy to engagemat work, and yet with seeming occupation and means of sub- sistence. In a day or two after the interview with Frank Naylor, Mr. Cummins took out a warrant, founded on his oivn affidavit, charging that Jacob Bowman feloniously murdered Ratliff Naylor on the night of September 15, 18-. The accused was forthwith arrested, and taken before three magistrates, who heard the evidence, and committed him, to jail, to await the action of the grand   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       57 jury. The regular term of the circuit court was soon held, at which Judge Kingsley presided. A true bill was found, and Bowman was placed on his trial for murder. The State was represented by Hiram Jones, Esq., the At- torney-General, and the prisoner was defended by Messrs. Judkins and Walker, two distinguished advocates. The prosecution established the killing on the night of the 15th September, and the finding next day of a two-handled jug half full of whiskey. Urban Oldfield was sworn, and, being shown the jug in open court, testified that he filled it with a half-gallon of whiskey on the 15th September, at the request ,of Wilkins Wylder, Esquire, who was then canvassing for the Legislature. Mr. Wylder was next called to the stand, and confirmed the statement of Mr. Oldfield. The prisoner asked him for the liquor, and he ordered it to be given to him, at his (Wylder's) charge. On the cross-examination, Mr. Judkins inquired of Mr. Wylder if, from the poverty of the pri- soner, he could have obtained the liquor without his pa- tronage. The court ruled this question out of order, but allowed the witness to express an opinion, if he thought proper to do so. Mr. Wylder replied that he was not suffi- ciently acquainted with the condition or habits of the pri- soner to say whether or not he could pay fifty cents for a half-gallon of whiskey. It was a small sum, and most L men could command it by their labor: some would not. Hie had never seen the prisoner before that time, and looked upon him as a very degraded, worthless man. The election-canvass was then progressing, and witness was a candidate, which fact exposed him to the intrusion of the prisoner. Witness was in the habit of treating, the people, as the custom was called, by ordering spirits to be fur- nished, and a  general invitation given to partake. But the prisoner was the only man who had applied to him for a jug full; and that circumstance alone marked him as an unprincipled creature in thus taking advantage of the can-  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7248-00000030"/> 58       WILKINS WYDER; OR, didate. The next time he saw him was on the day of election, when the prisoner made hmself known- to wit- ness. He had on a new suit of clothes, and was so im- proved in appearance that witness did not recognise him at first sight. This was the extent of witness's knowledge of the prisoner. Martin Combs testified that about the 20th September he sold prisoner a suit of clothes out of the store of Eghert Scott, amounting to thirty dollars. The mulberry merino coat now on his back (pointing to the prisoner) was among the articles sold him. In paying for the clothes, the pri- soner passed to witness a ten-dollar bill on the "Drovers' Bank of Kentucky." [Here the Attorney-General handed to witness a bill, and asked him ton say whether it was the one he received from prisoner.] Witness was confident it was the same bill: he had put a private mark on it when he afterward let the coroner have it to promote the public justice. Frank Naylor, the next witness, stated that he saw his father, the deceased, receive the bill from Green Hen- dricks, a mule-driver from Kentucky. He gave the parti- culars, which are not necessary to be mentioned. His father was in the habit of having from five hundred to two thousand dollars in cash always onl hand. Some half-dozen prominent citizens of the county were then sworn, who stated that they had known the prisoner ten or fifteen years,-that he wab notoriously an idle, pro- fligate man, and never had thirty dollars, honestly, in his life. e Here the prosecution closed. The prisoner's counsel in- formed the court that he would offer no testimony. Under a rule of the court, this entitled him to the concluding ar- gument before the jury. The Attorney-General then reviewed the evidence in a calm and - logical manner, showing that circumstances proved the guilt of the prisoner beyond any reasonable   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       59 doubt. He looked upon the case as too plain to require comment. The jury had-intelligence enough to perceive that link after link had been supplied to complete the chain of evidence connecting the prisoner with the murder. The  prisoner had committed the terrible deed for the purposes of robbery, and had succeeded in getting possession of the money, or at least a portion of it, which had been traced to his hands. He had not explained how he came in pos- session of that Kentucky bill; and but for the remark of a member of the inquest relatitve to the taste of certain ::quor, the criminal would probably have escaped detection. I Much credit was due to the coroner for his address in the matter. His vigilance entitled him to rank with High- Constable Hays of New York, who had unfolded so many intricate plots and contrivances to elude the public justice. Let no man henceforth believe that guilt can prosper, however ingeniously concealed. There is a retributive Providence that sooner or later brings the felon to punish- ment, even before an earthly tribunal. Mr. Judkins confessed that 'the circumstances were unfavorable to the accused. He did not rise to address the jury so much on the evidence of guilt or innocence, as on a question which he desired to make subser- vient to the public good. He had been inclined, at one stage of the case, to file the plea of insanity,-that the pri- soner was morally insane at the time he committed the deed, if the jury should believe that he did commit it. From compassion to human infirmity, the law holds no man accountable for his acts while deprived of his reason. In this view, the prisoner could with propriety have urged his defence. Blt, on reflection, his counsel decided that the plea might not be legally well founded, and he was un. willing to increase the number of such excuses, lest some- thing might grow out of the discussion which would have an immoral tendency. It would be dangerous to hold that, because an intoxicated man had lost his reason  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7248-00000031"/> 60       WILKINS- WYDER; OR, for the time-being, he could not be punished for any crime committed while the fit of insanity continued. There was another consideration which had induced the prisoner's counsel to waiv e that defence. It could not have been in- sisted on without placing a very prominent and worthy gentleman in a painful attitude before the public. The proof showed his allusion. A half-gallon of whiskey had been furnished the prisoner by a candidate, and that liquor produced insanity, during which the prisoner forgot him- self and. struck the blow that he might enjoy the plunder. Had he remained sober, he would have lacked the nerve to perpetrate the crime. The argument against treating at elections was here most wofully illustrated. It was known that he (Mr. jhdkins) had. recently contended with the witness (Mr. Wylder) for a seat in the Legislature as a temperance candidate; but the fumes of whiskey proved victorious, and his respected rival won the day by a large vote. Would that with the triumph no stain of murder and felony was connected! May it prove a -salutary warning in all the future, to banish the shameful practice of treating!- Of course, he attached no positive blame to the successful candidate, who merely followed in the path marked out by preceding competitors for office, and he truly'sympathized with that gentleman in his indirect agency in so fatal an occurrence. The prisoner was convicted, sentenced, and hung. On the scaffold he confessed the crime, and attributed it to the half-gallon of whiskey. He, said that he was too poor to buy liquor enough to make himself drunk, and he was in- debted to the liberality of Mr. Wylder for the privilege of  forfeiting his life and sending his soul to perdition!   A,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        61 CHAPTER X. ON the first day of the session Mr. Wylder took his seat in the Legislature. The first week he spent in forming acquaintances, and arriving at the intellectual and business qualities of the members. The Governor's message was a long and windy document, elaborate in generalities, full of partisan zeal, and specific in no recommendation whatever, except that the public welfare "demanded a system of schools coextensive with the wants of the age, the dignity of the State, and the happiness of the people; which system, maturely devised and judiciously executed," he urged upon the Legislature as a paramount duty. Mr. Wylder had given his attention to politics only a year or two before he was called to the law-making department. He read the Executive message over and over, carefully noticing the words, and weighing them in his literary scales, to discover the meaning. His conclusion was that the Governor intended to write so many columns in a newspaper, as mere form, and to give his phrases an elegant polish, without being encumbered with any ideas whatever. This was his first impression; and he found it difficult to lay it aside on still further perusal, even after the Governor's organ, the "Expositor," bad praised the message as a "lucid and masterly production, worthy of the best days of the Republic, wise in policy, felicitous in detail, and conclusive in its reasonings." This was indeed a brilliant flourish about a small matter, in the estimation of our young representative. For the first tae in his life, he felt unhappy, disappointed. With the early days of the Republic he had always associated 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7248-00000032"/> Y62      WWILKINS WYDER; OR, such men as Washington, Franklin, Adams, Henry, Jeffer- son, Madison, and the like. All the information he had of these characters was derived through books and news- papers; and now it was asserted, in a gazette of esta- blished influence, that the feeble message of Governor Slangford was a great performance, entitled to rank with the best state papers of our Revolutionary patriots! There was misconception somewhere Either Washington had been overrated in history, filling our minds with a grand picture, by which other men were judged in comparison, or Governor Slangford had been most extravagantly bedi- zened and all truth set at defiance in the eulogies on his message. If the same high coloring prevailed in the editorial profession in the better days of the Republic, there was very little confidence to be placed in the newspapers which repre- sented the men of that period. It was fair to presume that the press was equally reliable in the former and present ages of our Government. A cloud hung over the question; and Mr. Wylder regretted that the necessity of deciding so delicate an issue had been cast on him. But it was impos- sible for Gov. Slangford's message to be what the "Exposi- tor" called it; and it was possible that Gen. Washington and his co-workers might be less than history claimed for them. In this light Mr. Wylder was constrained to view the press as imposing on the minds of men. But he did not long hesitate in his course. He knew that, however perverted or selfish the press might be, it made and overthrew men at its pleasure, and that there was no possibility of accomplishing any thing of value in public life without its friendly support. This conviction turned Mr. Wylder's mind into a channel different from that which he had marked out for himself. He had intended to be frank and upright in his public career, exerting all his talents for the good of his country in such manner as circumstances might dictate. When he heard certain men Speak in the Legislature,-experienced men, of whom he had read highly-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       63 wrought eulogies in the newspapers,-they fell so far below his expectation that he was sadly grieved at the failure. For the credit of his race, and for the sake of the ideal of great-  ness which he had attached to men who had a newspaper fame, he was loath to believe the reality. It was a transi- tion from light to darkness, from a gorgeous temple to a mud cabin; and he was compelled to follow the descent: A part of Mr. Wylder's education had been to turn difficulties and disappointments to advantage, if possible. He saw merit trodden down, honor disregarded, afd igno- rance and presumption rewarded with high place. There was no dignity, no intelligence, no public spirit, in the Legislature, and very little in the other two branches of the government. All that public men seemed to care for was to thrust themselves into notoriety and to be looked upon as leaders. Such a state of things Mr. Wylder sincerely deplored; but it was out of his power to change it for the better. He was only one against hundreds; and his plan was fixed, which will unfold itself in these pages. Half the session had passed, and Mr. Wylder had been mainly a silent voter. Beyond a few explanatory remarks on some measure, he had taken no share in debate. Ho now resolved to bring forward his popular platform. "Whereas, in all well-regulated governments the follow- ing principles must apply in the'administration:- 1. The people are the source of all power. "2. Popular elections can only be safe as the ballot-box is pure. "3. To secure a wise choice of public agents, the people must be enlightened. "4. Knowledge and virtue should be fostered by a system of public schools. "5. Those who enjoy the benefits of government should pay its expenses: property and taxation should go to- gether.  4  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7248-00000033"/> "       WILKINS WYDER; OR, "6. The strength of a nation consists in the muscle and patriotism of its sons: therefore privileges should be granted as a reward for service in war. "7. The expenses of government should never exceed the most economical rates of taxation. "8. No discriminations should be made at the cost of one citizen to enrich another. "9. All free citizens being equal, no service or duty should be required of one more than of another. "10. Agriculture being the foundation, it is right to en- courage labor by which other pursuits may patronize agri- culture. "11. As the mechanic arts are essential to the general comfort and happiness, it is important that all'facilities be granted in their behalf. "12. Public health being a paramount consideration, it is highly proper that all atmospheric, mineral, and vege- table poisons be excluded from contact with the citizens. "13. Commerce and travel being necessary to a great people, suitable lines of communication should be esta- blished, by turnpikes, railways, canals, and other similar works, as experience shall deem practicable, at the expense of those who may be profited thereby. "And whereas, the principles of the Graball party having ever been wlse and prevalent in our national administration, it doth become this General Assembly to declare: "1. That the discovery in 1492 of a new Continent by Christopher Columbus formed a distinct era in civil liberty and national greatness, and that this General Assembly doth acknowledge its obligations to that bold navigator for this 'land of the free and home of the brave,' covered by the wings of the American eagle. "2. That the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth was a happy event, only equalled by their patriotism and dis- interested resolution, 'That the earth and all the fulness    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        65 thereof belongs to the Lord,' andf further, 'That we are the heirs of the Lord.' "3. That the Graball party have ever cherished the Puritan creed of pro ietorship, and this General Assembly doth duly announce that the offices of government belong to the most capable and worthy, and that the members of the said party are the only persons who fall within this de- scription of claimants. "4. That the Declaration of Independence on the 4th day of July, 1776, was a patriotic measure, of which this General Assembly doth explicitly approve; and that its author, Thomas Jefferson, ought to be held in grateful remembrance. "5. That the late King, George III., and his Cabinet, although not intending their measures to work for the good of British subjects in America, did actually contribute by their errors to the formation of the Graball party; and to this extent the said King and his Prime Minister, Lord North, were public benefactors. "6. That the policy of government is best advanced'by a rigid adherence to principle; and that the Graball party are alone competent to explain and carry out any principle which tends to benefit the greatest number. "7. That the revenues of the government should be derived in an equitable manner, and that no money should be appropriated by Congress except to subserve the public welfare, which is inseparable from the fundamental land- marks and personal convenience of the Graball party. "8. That the public domain acquired by the General Government by cession from the old States, or by purchase from foreign Powers, or by conquest, should be held as a sacred trust for common participation, and that the Graball party should prescribe all needful rules concerning the same. "9. That our foreign relations should be so managed as not to give offence without adequate cause on the one hand, E         (,  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7248-00000034"/> O0fi      WILIINS WYDER; OR,  nor to submit to insult or wrong on the other; and to this end the Presidents Belected by the Graball party have set an example worthy of all admiration, and such as this General Assembly doth recommend to their successors. "10. That the Army is of service to the whole country in time of war, and in peace most beneficial to the Graball part+4, in circulating millions of the public treasure which might otherwise be lost. ". That the Navy is a potent arm of national defence, and has done much for the protection of commerce and American honor. For its brave deeds in the War of 1812 with Great Britain, this General Assembly doth tender unfeigned thanks, and recommend that Congress increase the strength thereof. "12. That equality of burdens and privileges among the people can only be attained by a proper construction of the federal compact, and by unswerving fidelity to the same.               , "13. That national gratitude is an ornament to any people; to which end this General Assembly doth confess its obligations to Martin Luther and John Calvin for their successful labors in the cause of religious freedom, and to his holiness the Pope for yielding with pious will to the Reformation in the sixteenth century; and more than all doth this General Assembly recognise George Washington as-the hero and sage who confirmed these blessings to the American people." These resolutions, offered by Mr. Wylder, were read at the clerk's table amid profound silence and astonishment. Their author maintained great composure and dignity of manner, neither looking around for applause, nor pasting his eyes on the floor from apprehension of rebuke. He was raised and educated a fearless gentleman, had the appear- ance of a refined gentleman; and he was determined to bear himself through the scene like a heroic gentleman. j    ad ouUUiZ51.RB UJ MJANC.    67 His mind had taken in the whole landscape, and he in- tended to bestow on the figures moving before him a degree of individual life which no political limner had previously attempted. CTTAPTER XI. IN the next issue of the "Expositor," an article appeared under the editorial head, which is worth transcribing:- "SINGULAR TASTE.-On Wednesday last, Mr. Wylder, of Franklin, submitted in the Houseof Representatives a series of resolutions of a most extraordinary character, which will be found in our columns to-day. We are at a loss how to class them, whether as the emanation of a strong, comprehensive intellect manifesting itself for laud- able ends, or as the merry sport of a fertile imagination which has selected this mode of introducing its resources to the public. Strange as it may seem, the production authorizes either view. -It has a semblance of propriety, though rambling in its' scope, pointless in doctrine, and varied in conception, with the plainest truisms dressed in shining livery, and familiar maxims arranged in quite an original shape. To our mind, the whole is nothing more nor less than a playful puzzle, which its youthful author has invented for the amusement of the House. "And yet we are reluctant to adopt this conclusion. Mr. Wylder is said to be a highly-educated and upright gentle- 'man, raised in the strictest faith of the 'Graball party.' This fact excludes the idea that he designs to ridicule his own political associates, or their time-honored sentiments, which he has chosen to illustrate his future. He has too much at stake for such an experiment. Possessing wealth and a proud social position, crowned by a natural eloquence and grace of manner which would command respect in any deliberative body, he is no desperate adventurer to  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7248-00000035"/> J       WIILKINS WYDER; OR,  obtain notoriety at all hazards. Our present inclination is to consider the movement as originating in good faith o i the part of Mr. Wylder, for which he alone is responsible,.  as we feel confident that he never disclosed his purpose to any member of the party until the resolutions were read  in the House. What will be their fate when taken up, we are unable to predict, owing to the peculiar skill in their preparation. One result is sure to follow,-full and elabo- rate discussion, which will bring to light much that is m curious and instructive in the nature of government, and especially a flow of argument sustaining the principles an dusages of the Graball party. We shall again recur to the subject as it progresses through the forms of legisla- tion." The correspondent of the "Wayside Observer," who took notes of what was going on, thus expressed himself:- "Never did bombshell or Congreve rocket thrown into a besieged town produce greater consternation than that which I -witnessed yesterday in the House, among the 'Graballs.' It was perfect fun to the Opposition. I think that our minority, the 'Growlers,' will make capital out of this stampede. The facts are briefly these. ' Mr. Wylder, of Franklin, a young and talented member of the ' Graball party,' offered a set of resolutions, in which the nicest burlesque was mingled with seeming propositions which no man could deny. I send you a copy. There never has been so complete a hit under the mask of serving a cause. That the author of this proceeding has some ul- timate object to accomplish, is evident from the materials "he has drawn together. No museum ever afforded such a display of curiosities: every sentence has an edge, and every expression a hard point, to expose the Graball hum- buggery. You know their skill in framing platforms, in affirming old saws, and incorporating any new idea or principle-which will take with the masses. This is the \    'CUE Sin UCCEUSISFCUL MA6N.   69 kind of food on which the Graballs have subsisted for the last thirty years. "All this deception Mr. Wylder saw, and his bold, honest nature revolted at it; whereupon he took the most effectual method of exposing it. I could specify the cutting satire which lurks in most of the resolutions,-thirteen on' State policy, and the same number on national affairs, to cor- respond as a talisman with the original States of the Union. Even in this very arrangement there is a stroke at the cant phrases and reminiscences of the Graball party. The end is certainly not yet with these resolutions. If laid on the table or voted down, Mr. Wylder will go before the people, and there make out his case to the overthrow of the hypocritical faction. With all my heart I wish him success. "The Growlers in the Legislature will stand aloof, and take no share in the fight. They will possibly vote in favor of some resolutions, in which no party strife is in- volved, such' as relate to the discovery of America, the Declaration of Independence, and the crowning services of General Washington. The Growlers are too sagacious to commit themselves on the resolutions approving the conduct of Luther, Calvin, and the Pope. "I think the session is likely to prove interesting. The discussions soon to come on will elicit new talent in each branch of Assembly. The Senate has a majority of five which will sanction whatever the Graballs in the House may do of a party character. If I am not greatly mis. taken, Mr. Wylder will give a good account of himself in the fight on his resolutions. His appearance is very strik- ing; and it is said that he was educated by atprivate tutor whose equal has not been found in this country. With the most varied knowledge of books Mr. Wylder unites the advantage of extensive travel, and all the grace which wealth can bestow. He is not more than twenty-two years of age, but has the eye and port of a veteran war.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7248-00000036"/> 70       WILKINS WYDER; OR, rior. He is ready for the Hessian phalanx whenever it may charge upon him." A writer for the "Graball Record" is more dispassionate. His remarks do him credit, as the reader may judge from this specimen:- "The sensation produced by Mr. Wylder's resolutions is not likely to abate. Some of the party editors have as- sailed him as a traitor to the cause with which he professes to be identified,-asserting that in the disguise of a Graball he is playing into the hands of the Growlers, and that by so doing he expects to elevate himself inutoCongress. Nothing can be more unjust than these imputations. Mr. Wylder may be ambitious, and his talents unquestionably entitle him to the very highest places of honor; but he is modest, and full of high-toned qualities of mind and heart. He would not stoop to an unworthy action to secure fame. His future need not be rashy tempted. Circumstances point to him as the very man to lead off in the great drama of reform. His Antecedents can do him no prejudice. On that score all is bright. His resolutions are well calculated to serve the object in view. Let any member of the Graball party oppose one of them, and he will repent of his rash- ness. They all contain self-evident propositions, or affirm the doctrines of the party. "In my letters I shall be happy to give such information as may prove agreeable to you as a partisan; but if you expect me to join in a crusade against Mr. Wylder for the step he has taken, you will have no sympathy from me, nor will I be silent at any such injustice. Let him have a fair showing; let him be heard'; and then, if you condemn him, it will be your right when he fails to justify his course. You know that I am a party man, and that I have aided to the best of my ability to serve the Graball party from my boyhood; but I trust that I am a fair-minded man, ready to do justice even to an opponent. Mr. Wylder shallnot be cast overboard, as long as I can shiver a lance   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       71 for his protection while under the glorious Graball flag. This, I am glad to believe, is the general feeling. His fate depends on the speech he is expected to make in sup- port of the resolutions. Others may think as they please; but I do not hesitate to predict a signal triumph by Mr. Wylder over all objections to his programme. It is founded in reason and truth; and the burlesque is only a purifier of the blood and a corrective of the abuses of the Graball party." In the mean time, the resolutions were likely to be reached on the calendar of the House. Mr. Wylder be- trayed no solicitude as to their fate, and when they were called in their order by the presiding officer he made no attempt to gain the floor. His calm and intrepid look was very expressive. It signified that he did not care a fig what was done with them. If laid on the table, or indefi- nitely postponed, or rejected, it was the same to him; and this the majority perceived. He knew what use he could make of either result before the people. If adopted, the party would be ridiculed for its empty generalities and unmeaning avowals, which was the object Mr. Wylder really had in view, for the purpose of reforming the practice; and if the resolutions were defeated by a vote, he would then turn to the record and accuse the leaders of want of faith to their principles. Mr. Tilford, a leading member of the House on the Graball side, saw that it was the best policy to treat the resolutions and their author with respect. On his motion, their further consideration was postponed to a day certain in the ensuing week.- As the time for action drew near, there was a visible trembling and whispering in the ranks of the majority, as if some blow of fate were about to prostrate them. Regular consultations were held. Some of the members of the party were for open war against the author, denouncing him as an enemy to Graball prin- ciples.. Others, and by far the larger number, deemed conci-  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7248-00000037"/> 72       wILKINS WYDER,;: OB, liation the wisest policy. They saw the trouble which   ! awaited the discussion, and thought it advisable to meet it i temperately. In this mood, the House of Representatives disposed of their regular business, awaiting the day of battle, when the sun of Austerlitz or the gloom of Waterloo was to prefigure the-' destiny of the young member from Franklin. '    " CTTAPTER XII. WHLE matters were hastening to a crisis, Mr. Wylder betrayed no alarm. Hoe was daily in his seat, attentive to every measure, and exchanging the usual courtesies of his position. He was fuily aware of the distrust with which he was regarded by members of his party, and of their determination to drive him to the wall for his auda- city. But this knowledge only made him the more reso- lute in his purpose. . He wrote to his father, stating the course he had taken, and bidding him be of good cheer in spite of the unfriendly newspaper comments.  His maiden effort was soon to be made; and he was certain of victory, because he had truth onehis side. The special order of the day was announced by the Speaker to be the resolutions offered by the- gentleman from Franklin; and the question was on their adoption. All eyes were turned on Mr. Wylder, who, with much self- possession,: and. in a -distinct, agreeable voice, thus ad- dressed the House:- "MR. SPEAKER:--I shall proceed at once to my object, and state why I offered these resolutions. I,have no doubt that older heads attribute -my course to a want of expe- rience. They are correct in this surmise; and I esteem it good fortune on, my part to be destitute of such expe- rience as the leaders of the Graball party seem to possess.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        73 In the simplicity of my heart, believing what I had read of great men, Presidents, Cabinet officers, Governors, Senators, and Representatives in Congress, judges, and other high functionaries, not omitting members of the Le- gislature, I had expected to find a degree of intelligence, capacity for business, public spirit, and personal refinement in those characters which would justify the representations of the press from which I had derived my ideas. While I was pursuing my education, I was favored with a glimpse of ancient lawgivers and public teachers of Greek and Roman fame. I accepted history as the truth, and' believed that great and good men had existed in all countries and ages of the world. "They were models which influenced my judgment of character. I perused the annals of my own country, and saw bright deeds recorded there,--heroes brave, magnani- mous, and successful; patriots whose 'wisdom and purity all men revered; statesmen of the loftiest intellect and of unsullied honor; sages to whom kings paid homage in foreign courts; and citizens who sacrificed their estates to serve their country. They were life-pictures which dazzled my imagination; and I looked forward with delight to the time and the occasion when I should see the originals face to face. I was impatient to reach the proper age when I could exercise the privilege. "I was trained in the Graball faith,--to look upon the creed, the platform, and the practice of the party as identical, harmonious in action  and of unimpeachable consistency.  My ambition led me to this Hall, where I was to realize in my  public associates the fond dreams which had clustered around me   for years. And what have I found?  Instead of the orators, the accomplished men, the ripe qualification, the chivalrous bearing, and delicate courtesies described in the newspapers as forming the attractions of this body, I see the names on your roll; but those who answer are mere men of straw, 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7248-00000038"/> 74       WYILKINS WYDER; OR, who have succeeded by mistake in obtaining the election- certificates which were granted to the rightful -owners. The men who sit around me do not belong to the class eulogized by the press. I speak by comparison merely. My knowledge of men, I confess, is very imperfect; and I mourn at the discovery which has cut off my hopes. Better for my happiness that I had slept on, confiding in books and newspapers relative to great men,--that all speeches in print were really made by the men to whom they were ascribed,-rather than wake up in the morning of life to ascertain the reverse.  "Mr. Speaker, I have an account to settle with my party, and I might as well begin. Their paper work, decla- rations of policy, love of the poor, and all the schemes' they can invent to acquire popularity, are well calculated to win confidence. Their leaders know what strings to play upon the Presidential harp, and what tune will kindle enthusiasm at the North, and how to raise the Marseilles Hymn-in the South, where the sons of Liberty, as they call them by way of pre-eminence, are ready to strike aggres- sion dead! And in this field my last resolution can find its appropriatelodging. Is not conciliation of votes the lever used to prize up the Graball machine and keep it in motion? Do not the followers of Luther and Calvin con- stitute the greatest number of voters in the United States? And are not the balance warm friends of the Pope, who have a musical brogue which you never fail to compliment? "' My design is here unfolded.. I have thrown :the devices of the party into shape, in order to brand them with merited scorn. The- time has arrived when success by false pretences should be as criminal in a political party as in a single individual. How frequently have we known indict- ments to be preferred in our courts of justice against men for obtaining goods by false representations of their credit and property! If the same code of morals and responsi- bility were applied to those who get up electioneering mt- \   TIIE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        d5 nifestoes to deceive the people and thereby obtain power how soon would our State prisons be inhabited by a class of gentlemen quite superior in social position to those who usually take quarters there after the courts have certified their claims to justice! For my part, I think a provision should be added to the penal code making political swindlers equally liable to punishment. You know, 1I.. Speaker, that I utter the truth when I declare that the Graball party and the Growler party have b6th to answer for great wickedness in this respect. I think, however, that my party, either from superior tact or good fortune, have gained more than their opponents by this kind of war- fare. But the error is not sanctified by success; and my desire is to apply the corrective before it is too late. "Look: on your platforms, Mr. Speaker. Are you not ashamed of the legerdemain used in their construction? You profess economy; and yet who can waste more of the public money? You claim that the Territories shall be common property; and yet you give away the lands to private companies. You insist on a  rigid interpretation; and yet you find authority in the Constitution for the most gigantic schemes of internal improvement. You denounce banks and a paper circulation; and still you issue millions of Treasury notes. I could enumerate many other known violations of your creed.. The truth is, sir, your pledges weigh not a feather against expediency in your system of ethics. Party first, and then country, is your order of precedence. "I judge others by the influences which have controlled me in this party malversation; and perhaps it is ri ht to confess. You, Mr. Speaker, were once as inexperien cd as myself, and can allow for my misconceptions. Within the last few years I passed out of the hands, of my tutor, who, with infinite labor and pains-taking to qualify me for use- fulness, taught me to regard men as elevated beings. He himself was rather a scholar than a practical observer; and  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7248-00000039"/> 76       WILKINS WYDER; OR, hence his favorable opinion of mankind. It was a pleasant idea, and I became indoctrinated with it. I read the pro- ceedings of National Conventions, the letters of acceptance by the nominees, the messages of the President, the reports of the heads of Departmen'ts, and all the documents of value published by order of Congress,-all of which excited my admiration. I looked upon the authors of these papers as the very elite of wisdom, learning, honor, and patriotism. Speeches delivered by the Honorable Zedekiah Thunder- gust, of the Senate, and by the Honorable Jonquil Whedle- berger, of the House of Representatives, full of lofty senti- ments and rich flowers of the imagination, captivated me. I was'perfectly spell-bound on the, perusal. Then the party organ at Washington, the 'Exterminator,' pronounced these and all other Graball. speeches to be 'proud trophies of the human intellect, and the most complete vindication of Graball measures which had ever fallen from human lips. We venture to say that Cicero and Demosthenes among the ancients, or the Earl of Chatham at a later' period, never displayed more brilliant eloquence or force of logic than did the Honorable Nicholas Trombone in his support of the Administration. His speech was over- whelming in statement, conclusive in deductions, and abso- lutely annihilating to the Growler faction. We take sin- cere pleasure in laying this speech before our readers to- day, and ask for it a careful perusal. ength [fourteen columns] should not preclude it from the mo'diligent in- vestigation; for in it is concentrated, as in a nuth, the whole theory of our happy form: of government and its beneficent operation under the Graball creed. All true \ patriots will devour its matchless teachings with an avidity only excelled by their devotion to Graball tendencies.' ".After reading these and similar productions, I became sleepless at the contemplation of such glory, and congra- tulated myself that by a visit to the Federal metropolis I could see these wonderful orators and take a peep   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       " behind the scenes. In the midst of a session, I became a spectator in the Halls of Congress; and my first inquiry was to behold with my own eyes those renowned men of whom I had read' in the 'Exterminator.' They were shown to me. fMr. Thundergust was a little red faced man who would pass, anywhere out of the Senate of the United States, as a liberal patron of some respectable bar-room; for he was tidily dressed, and put on airs to justify the inference that he was select in his company. Mr. Whedle- berger was a tall, bony man, a little uncouth in his man- ners, but with a pleasant smile on his face, as if very well pleased with himself and his prospects. I looked in vain for some mark of greatness. As for Mr. Trombone, hbe was proud and stately in his address, inclined to corpulence, and had a peculiarly dull eye, with a countenance to match. All of these gentlemen had a brazen, defiant air, implying a knowledge of their greatness. "I then directed my gaze over all the other members expecting to find the very best specimens that each State could furnish to adorn the-national councils. To do the Senate justice, that body was dignified enough; but the House of Representatives was nothing more nor less than a genteel mob, twenty men rising at once to obtain the floor, and nearly all the members with their feet resting on the top of their desks, very much in the manner of my fellow- legislators around me, all equally indifferent to public criti- eism and to their own reputation for good breeding. I formed the acquaintance of the most prominent men, in- cluding chairmen of the principal committees, whose reports had so stirred the public mind on certain topics. They all disappointed me. Some were conspicuously defective in education, and'unrefined in manner. Nor did the President and his Cabinet at all satisfy my expectations. There was no mark of superiority in  any of them, except in the Secretary of State. Before I conversed with these supreme officials, however, I had seen enough to convince 'me that  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7248-00000040"/> 78       WILKINS WYDER; OR,          ! if you wish to think a man great, you should never come n-ear him personally. "Now, Mr. Speaker, I had but one hope remaining to soothe my mortifications; and that was an inter- view with the famous editor of the 'Exterminator,' the recognised organ of the Graball party, which had a Euro- pean influence. I procured an introduction to this gentle- man, and began to tell him what pleasure his articles had afforded me, and how I had based my political faith on his profound teachings. He replied, with an arrogant toss of the head, that, since I was so much his debtor, I could not do less than subscribe for his paper and pay for one year in advance! I confess, the suggestion was proper; and I ad- mitted its force by instantly opening my purse and hand- ing over the sum, for which the editor filled a receipt. He then gave me to understand that it was a business hour with him, and that he would be glad to see me when he was more at leisure. It was my last call in Washington City during that visit. "You possibly demand within yourself, why have I brought all these personal matters before the House? What application can they have to the subject? I will briefly in- form you, sir. It is the boast of your party that they have had control of the Government for the last thirty years. They have had the most admirable doctrine, expounded by frequent conventions, and franked by millions over the whole country, besides being published in more than a hundred Graball newspapers, with editorial laudation, and rehearsed by a thousand stump speakers, for party triumph. You have done all these things, and more. You have fal- sified your own record. You won the people by fair pro- mises, and you have deceived them in your conduct. What was just in principle you have made criminal in practice. Many trusting hearts have bled at your treachery. I will give you an instance, adducing myself as a witness. "All the stores of information I possess,-all that I look "        ,      .   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       79 to for happiness,-all the images which yield delight to my mind,-the glories of the past serving as an index to the future,-have been derived from books, and other forms of reading. I had faith in what I read. I believed that the characters portrayed, and the events recorded, were real. My soul fired up, and all that was grand in chncep- tion lured me on to toil and hope. I gained the summit of knowledge, only to gaze on a wider sphere opening to my manhood. I had almost within my grasp the object of my desires,-the companionship of men virtuous in prin- ciple and noble in action, men who loved their country and had cultivated abilities to serve her. Such were the ideas I brought to bear on your partyqplatforms and decla- rations of principle. I believed all, I trusted all; and I gloried in being a Graball. "The resolutions I have offered recite your doctrines and professions. I hold you to them: you dare not de- sert your flag: it waves above you. I have not added to or taken from the programme on which you go before the people. The change is only dramatic, to render it the more effective. I demand the fulfilment of your promises. You have trifled long enough with the public mind. Judging by myself, you have mnisled thousands of young, confiding natures. You claimed to have the talents, the honor, and the administrative skill to make the Government superior to what it had ever bben, or could be, in the hands of the Growler opposition. I have seen your Presidents, your Governors, and many of your chief men. They are but ordinary characters. There is no true dignity or dis- interested patriotism among them,-no shining abilities, no faithful public service, no high literary cultivation, no moral grandeur. They devise traps to catch votes, and can play any tune for popularity,--write, talk, and deceive most valiantly; and here their qualifications terminate. Shade of Washington$.what an insult to humanity! "You know, Mr. Speaker, that you have played a bold  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7248-00000041"/> 80      - WILKINS WYDER; OR, game on the credulity of the people,--that you have expe- rimented upon them long enough. Cease, then, to mock the hopes and efforts of honest young men, who, believing in the histories they have read, entertain a good opinion of their race. Your example, reversing their favorable judg-, ment, is destructive of their happiness and their ability to be useful. They find it impossible to act like high-minded gentlemen and co-operate with you. Far better for them to remain in blissful ignorance, without any sweet visions from the halls of learning, than to possess refinement only to be tortured by your party goads. I will not consent to move an inch at your command, and I defy your revenge. Nor can I hope for the support of the Growlers, who, so far as, they have shown their practice in contrast with their principles, are not far behind you. Mere party men are the same, whatever the color of their flags. They are only a decent class of buccaneers, who - roam the seas of popular suffrage to plunder ip the disguise of patriotism! "Down with your false colors, Mr. Speaker, by which you have decoyed so many into your grasp. Discard your sys- tem of imposture, of giving credit to men for able speeches in print which they never wrote, of attributing -reports to committees who never prepared them, and of claiming for very moderate persons a high order of abilities when nomi- nated for office. 'The country is injured and disgraced, by such low cunning. Show yourself the true friend of human- ity, by enlightening the people, instead of keeping them in darkness for the furtherance of your paltry schemes. We must return to the frankness and simplicity of a better age, when fame was awarded only to merit, and not, as at pre- sent, to the stupid and presumptuous who climb to high places for the want of sensibility to perceive their demerit. Let us infuse more candor into our public journals, and more discrimination in our eulogies of each other. A newspaper compliment now, after the fashion of the Graball editors,!s not worth -.having. In this respect,    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       81 however, the Growler press has no very manifest advan. tagce. The journals on both sides need improvement, as well as our active politicians. 4 If .the majority think proper to adopt the resolutions I have submitted, I shall feel gratified. It will only be af- firming old things in a new dress, by which I aim to bring about a salutary reform. I admit the satire in every line. If adoptedthe Graball party will appear ridiculous enough; if the resolutions are rejected, I will go before the people, and make the most out of them which Gikaball precedent will authorize. If I can work up to that standard, I shall be victorious, whether right or wrong in my premises. My task is almost completed, and I shall cheerfully abide * the issue. I beg to say in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that I have intended no personal disrespect to any gentleman on this floor, or elsewhere, by the remarks I have made. My severity has been for illustration rather than from feeling. "Political friends, I turn to you in hope. Let your braggart vociferations cease, and no longer keep the world excited by the wonders you are to perform for the happi- ness of mankind. Say lesis and do more. By your con- stant boasting and your regular failures, you have de- stroyed the faith of men. Every thing is now at sea with- out rudder or compass. The press is no longer reliable: it has lost its influence by swelling very little men into prodigies of intellect and by its artfuil appeals to the majesty of virtue. Men distrust each other from your example of deception. History has lost its value, and fame is nothing but the capers of a mountebank on your platform. Honest minds are deeply wounded by your stratagems to gain favor. You have a very solemn respon- sibility to meet at the bar of public opinion. With a bruised yet hopeful spirit, I ask you to forsake your errors of party discipline, give up your bombastic pledges and feeble execution, and come down to natural propriety. I entreat you to assume this level at once, and begin a new F  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7248-00000042"/> 82       WILKINS WYDER; OR,            l career, like the prodigal son. The country will thank you; and it is the only course to preserve you from -destruc- J tion."  This speech created quite a sensation. Mr. Wylder had established a name, and he was looked upon with admira- tion and fear. Mr. Grimshaw, a leader on the Graball side of the House, took the floor. He regretted to hear the faults of his party pointed out by one of its members in so strong a light. It was the first time he -had seriously reflected on the subject; and in his opinion the safest course would be to adopt the resolutions. If they were rejected, a loud hue and cry would be raised, as their author had already notified the House. No further discussion being attempted, a direct vote was taken, and the resolutions were adopted. To this extent Mr. Wylder was victorious; but it will be seen what perplexities awaited him, and how he managed to overcome them, as he passed through life. CHAPTER XITT. THE next issue of the "Expositor" gave a new version of the matter. Mr. Wylder was handled with marked civility; and even his talents were confessed, as the article itself will show. "When they were first introduced," says the "Expositor," "we looked upon the resolutions of Mr. Wylder as highly objectionable, tending to ridicule and weaken the Graball party; but after the able speech of that gentleman, in which he explained his views and .the objects to be attained by the adoption of his programme, we are con- vinced that we did him injustice by our previous remarks; and it affords us sincere pleasure to withdraw every thing which might be construed to his disadvantage. ,f   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       83 "Under our Legislative head to-day appears a full and accurate report of Mr. Wylder's speech, and the action of the House adopting the-resolutions without amendment or division. It is sufficient to say that the result has been altogether satisfactory to the Graball party, and that Mr. Grimshaw, the veteran leader in the House, withdrew all opposition, and advised his political friends to support the resolutions offered, though he thought that a change of phraseology might improve themeas a whole. The sub- stance, however, met his approbation; and he gave them a cordial support. "We hqpe that our friends will be united in this matter, and not, by any dissensions among themselves, verify the predictions of the Growler clique at the capital, that Mr. Wylder had thrown combustible materials into the House which would effectually blow up the Graball camp. For a while there really seemed to be some danger of such a catastrophe; but, with the new light which has been shed on the principles and usages of the party, our banner waves more proudly than ever, to cheer a united and victorious band of patriots, to whom the country is in- debted for its salvation and prosperity." A correspondent of the "Growler Times" did not take the same view. He had-written several letters for publi- cation, expressing confidence that the Graball party could not survive Mr. Wylder's artful satire. Instead of widen- ing the breach, these letters closed it up entirely, by show- ing the Graballs the gulf which was yawning to swallow them up. The writer in the "Times" said:- "In my sketch of proceedings you will see the fate of Mr. Wylder's resolutions in the House yesterday. My first impressions have not been changed as to the effect the resolutions will have on the public mind. The Graballs were much alarmed, and the ' Expositor' had gone so far as to denounce Mr. Wylder as a traitor in the. camp;- but, as that gentleman proceeded in a fearless manner to show  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7248-00000043"/> 84        WILKINS WYDER; OI, the tergiversations of his party, they took counsel of their  fears, and knocked under to his overwhelming argument.  i When the machine invented by Mr. Wylder to grind out the false grain was first put in operation, not a solitary Graball would pull in the traces. They kicked, and plunged, and fretted themselves into perfect rebellion; but when the bold young driver began to apply the whip to their backs, they-. cooled down, and worked admirably gentle. To show their submission and gratitude to the horse-tamer, they all came to Mr. Wylder, and licked his hand, as if t craving more salt. We think the whole team will get   ! handsomely salted before the campaign is over; and if the Growlers possess half the tact ascribed to them by their 4 opponents, they can desire nothing better than the Wylder resolutions to explode the rotten concern, known as the Graball party,-giants in promises, but pigmies in per- formance. The whole country is disgusted with their   il abominations." Mr. Wylder wrote to his father, and enclosed him a copy of the "Expositor" which contained his speech. The letter is brief, but worthy of the occasion:- - "HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, Dec. 20, 18-. "MY DEAR FATHEr :--That you may know the result, I refer you to the paper herewith, containing my speech. Whilst I desire your good opinion, and will try to deserve it through all the vicissitudes of life, I feel some degree of pride in announcing the auspicious termination of my first measure. My object has been to carry out your lesson,- Success at all hazards. I saw there was urgent necessity for reform in the party, and I took the initiative. You know the abuse heaped upon me at first; but, like a true soldier, I stood the fire and marched on to victory. I believe the party will be stronger and purer after its pur- gation by the medicine I have administered to it in my   -'na oUUCESSFUL MAN.       85 resolutions and speech; and I shall be happy if you approve my course.        With purest affection, W. WYDER." As evidence that Dr. Wyllder was gratified at the success of his son in the Legislature, the following note is inserted:- "WYLDER HALL, Dee. 22, 18-7. "DEAR WILKINS :-I have read all; and, though your step was hazardous in the extreme, I congratulate you on the victory you have obtained. Henceforth I shall have the utmost confidence in your sagacity and firmness to make good the motto I selected for your guidance. Without success, it would be far better that we had never lived. "Yours ever,      ANDREW WYLDER." The party organ at Washington (the "Exterminator,") contained a very edifying article on Mr. Wylder. After commenting on his resolutions and speech, the editor closed thus:- "Taken altogether, the result will be generally approved. It seems to be one of the attributes of the glorious Graball party that when, by some indiscretion of its leaders, dr from    any untoward course of events, gloom  has collected over its fortunes, a deliverer will appear, just as Moses was providentially raised up in Egypt to lead the hosts of Israel into a   place of safety.  So it has been, comparatively, in the noted instance before us, when Mr. Wylder, of the South, by a heroic exposure of himself to peril, has nobly revived and illustrated the platform of the party, in a  style which shows him to be a master-workman. We learn that it is his first step (we should rather call it a stride) in political life; a few more such strides will land him wherever his ambition may direct. The country has much to expect from this gifted young statesman; and we congratulate our party on having such a champion to be'ar  .8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7248-00000044"/> 86   1    WILKINS WYDER; OR, up their noble cause. The resolutions of Mr. Wylder have been heretofore published in the 'Exterminator, and Awe have the pleasure of gracing our columns to-day with his most admirable speech on the condition of the party. "We are not in the habit of referring to the private opinions of the President and his Cabinet, respecting any man or measure; but we feel persuaded that we betray no confidence in saying that the course of Mr. Wylder has been informally touched upon, in a late consultation, with decided favor to this eminent young Graball. He has brightened up the old ship for a more successful voyage  than ever, to extend the area of freedom, and to shake the  despotisms of the world, through the influence of Graball  principles. His exposition will henceforth be the standard, just as the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798-99 are, to solve the doubts of mankind in regard to our political system."/' But it seems that Mr. Wylder's course did not satisfy all his party friends. One of them addressed him anonymously, through the "Expositor," in this shape:- "An admirer of genius has the honor of saluting Mr. Wylder, of Franklin, and of testifying his astonishment and regret at the course of that gentleman. His resolu- tions and speech, under color of rectifying the errors, will be the death-of the Graball party. He has complicated it with so many obvious truths and with so much lurking satire as to render the party absolutely ridiculous in the ey-es of the world. The writer of this note, therefore, begs to protest against the course of Mr. Wylder, and to place his protest on record, to confirm or falsify his judgment as-the future may determine.      A VOTER." Mr. Wylder paid no formal attention to this " protest," as it contained no personalities which would oblige him to call for the author. In the next paper it was ansiered, by some one unknown to Mr. Wyldbr, as follows:-   THE BUCCESSFUL MAN.        87 "The gentleman who signs himself 'A Voter,' in the last 'Expositor,' may be very wise aid very worthy, and a genuine Graball; but, if he have these qualifications, he has exposed them to forfeiture in predicting the rnin of his party by the resolutions and speech of Mr.- Wylder. The author of this reply to the 'protest' of 'A Voter' takes just the opposite view. Had not MrI. Wylder fortu- nately come forward as he did, to bleed and blister the patient and to apply his salve, the illustrious Graball dynasty must have died within a few months. Since this skilful treatment, however, the patient is in better health -than ever, and bids fair to live a hundred years. "JUSTICE." While these missiles were flying around him, Mr. Wylder was occupied in maturing a measure of great im- portance,-nothing more nor less than a bill establishing public schools throughout the State. It proposed a tax of five cents on each hundred dollars' worth of property, to con- stitute an educational fund estimated at $250,000 annually. All children between the ages of seven and fifteen years were to participate of free tuition. Each county was to be laid off into townships or districts of six miles square, as nearly as circumstances would permit, taking population into the account. The teachers were to be examined by a competent board, in order to charge the public. They were to report every six months to the county judge of probate the names and ages .of the pupils, the branches of study in which they were engaged, and the rates for each branch. These reports were to'be condensed in a tabular statement to the Governor: who would cause a general abstract to be laid before the Legislature. If more children were returned tha'n the fund could educate- in t-he plain branches of knowledge, including arithmetic, then the tax was to be increased, but not to exceed ten cents on the hundred dollars. This last, it was believed, would  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7248-00000045"/> 88       WILKINS WYDER; OR, secure to every person in the State a degree of intelligence which would improve society and promote the happiness of all. The plan waq favorably entertained by the House. All the members felt the necessity of doing something for public education; and even the "Expositor" made an offer- ing of its partisan ferocity on the altar of virtue. The editor thus discoursed :- "Yesterday there was a glorious movement in the House of Representatives, inaugurated by Mr. Wylder, of Frank- lin, who has been honorably conspicuous by his talents and practical wisdom, the more worthy of applause on ac- count of his youth,-that gentleman not having yet com- pleted his twenty-third year. The country owes him a debt of gratitude for his bill to establish public schools, and for his sagacity-in devising a scheme by which they shall be liberally supported without the burden being felt by tax-payers/ This was the critical point; and we rejoice that Mr. Wylder has struck the right key for success. His sympathies are with the masses of his countrymen, while his honor is identified with freedom in all its ramifications. The bill is of such length as to preclude its insertion in our columns to-day. Ini our next issue we shall at least give a synopsis of its provisions. Judicious as we regard the measure, we fear it is destined to encounter opposition from that quarter of the House which is unable to distin- guish a one-cent copper piece from a gold eagle, both looking alike yellow and both having the bird of Liberty stamped upon their face. But we anticipate that the true friends of the people, who have at least intelligence and patriotism equal to the enemy, will pass the bill by a con. siderable majority." .   Q   THE SUCCESSFUL DIAN.       89 CHAPTER XIV. As the calendar of the House showed that the bill to establish public schools would be reached in a few day3s, on its third reading, Mr. Wylder felt that he rad so much at stake, it was necessary to be well prepared for the discus- siort He accordingly wrote out his speech, in as few words as possible, and committed it to memory, supposing that his arguments would appear t. better advantage by this method than if he trusted to the impulse of the occasion, though he designed, by the manner -of its delivery, that his speech should not smell of the midnight oil. His bill was made a special order; and on the evening previous to. the day appointed for its consideration in the House, Mr. Alonzo Perkins called at the lodgings of Mr. Wylder, to have a free conversation with him on the bill. Mr. Perkins was from the same Congressional district, represented a neighboring county, and was a  zealous friend of the bill, intending to make a  speech in its favor, but did not wish to advance any arguments that would conflict with those of its author. He therefore requested Mr. Wylder to give him a few hints which would enable him the better to arrange his thoughts for the discussion. Mr. Wylder handed him his written speech, to take home for perusal, but to be returned before the House met the next morn- ing. The speech was punctually returned to its author,  with thanks for the privilege of a hasty examination. The House met, and the bill was announced for a third reading, when Mr. Perkins instantly arose and addressed "MR. SPEAKER :-I   have so much respect for the judg- ment of the House that I  deem it unnecessary to consume  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7248-00000046"/> 90       WILKINS WYSLDER; OR, its time by protracted remarks. The bill has been printed, and is familiar to members. Hitherto the idea of taxation has kept down all-attempts to establish public schools in the State; but a better feeling now prevails,-a more en- larged sympathy with the masses on the part of wealthy men, who begin to discover that ignorance is the parent of anarchy, and that unless the people be enlightened there is no safeguard for property,-the agrarian or level- ling principle always abounding where vice is most preva- lent, and vice itself in communities is known to be the offspring of mental darkness. I should be happy to asso- i ciate my humble name with some plan for giving light to the masses. As a patriot, I feel under obligations to exert all my faculties to this end. For the privilege of address- ! ing this House, and of deriving honor from the station I : occupy, I am indebted to education entirely. Without it, I should this day have been in some obscure retreat, per- 1 haps a drunkard and a bully, fighting at horse-races, a slavito animal passion. I have seen men drift into this whirlpool whose natural abilities were superior to mrime. But it was my good fortune to be early instructed in letters, and to have the evil tendencies of my nature-cheeked by  , knowledge, with her bright domain always inviting me onward to purer joys. I thank Heaven that I have tasted of the precious fruit,-of the nectar of the gods. It has destroyed my relish for inferior pleasures. ' "The happiness of man, Mr. Speaker, does not, consist in food and raiment alone, however abundant these may   i be. There is a divinity in man which must be stirred to bring out his true character,-to give him his proper intel- lectual and moral stature in the world. , The great moralist, Dr. Johnson, has said that when the mind can feast on the past, or on thejfuture, so as to raise it above present troubles, it is in the best condition for happiness. I give you the idea, without his splendid language, whhich I have not at command. There is philosophy in this sentiment,   THT- SUCCESSFUL MAN.       91 as we know by daily experience. Take from us all plea- sant memories and hopes, and how would it be possible for us to sustain the trials of life? I confess my inability to do so. Let the sphere of the mind be enlarged by educa- tion; let facts from history, and: the curious accidents of fortune, the struggles of genius and the triumphs of virtue, all be as so many pictures to fill the mind with variety, and other stimulants will not be wanted. The inebriating cup and the beggar's doom will be avoided. Secure as I fancy myself, and well taught by example and precept as I have been, I know my infirmities too well to boast of my escape from such a destiny on any ground save that of education. As I have received, so am I willing to give, and to help all my fellow-beings. I could add other arguments; but this is enough to enlist my support of the bill." This little speech was delivered in good style, and was listened to by the House with marked attention. Mr. Perkins was a lawyer, about twenty-five years of age, and possessed great animation of manner. It was his first effort in the Legislature, and it argued well for his future success. Had Mr. Wylder given utterance to what was passing in his mind, he would merely have said to the House that the gentleman from Columbia (Mr. Perkins) had just made the speech he intended to make, word for word, and that in fact it was his (Mr. Wylder's) speech, which he had loaned to his friend Mr. Perkits to show the points he had taken in support of the bill. But Mr. Wylder kept his secret. During the delivery of the speech, he prepared a  substitute for the bill, to the effect that a tax of one cent on every hundred dollars' worth of property should be collected, which would amount, by estimation, to fifty thousand dollars. This sum was to pay for certain pictorial representations, a copy of which should be fur- nished to each family in the State: 1. An engraving, ten by twelve inches, of a neat country church, with portico and belfry.   &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7248-00000047"/> 92    4   WILKINS WYDER; OR, 2. A large academy, such as is usual in cities, and by its side a log school-house, such as is common in the country, with a group of scholars at play in the yard. 3. A neat cottage, with handsome flower-yard, and out- side of the paling the figures of a horse, cow, sheep, hog. turkey, chicken, duck, and guinea-fowl, and growing corn in the distance. 4. A waterwheel, cotton-gin, cob-mill, and saw-mill, with other representations of machinery. 5. A ship with sails spread, a steamboat, and a train of railroad-cars. All the engravings were to be of equal size, ten by twelve inchesof lithograph impressions. A commission was to be appointed by the Governor, to have the Work done in a proper style, and distributed so that every householder should possess a copy of the five pictures, to be hung up within view of the family and visitors. The substitute was ready to be offered when Mr. Perkins closed his speech. Immediately Mr. Wylder took the floor, and remarked,-  "MR. SPEAKER:--Since introducing the bill now under consideration, to establish public schools, I have reflected on the tax feature, which I am apprehensive would not be well received by the people. The rate of five cents-on the hundred dollars of taxable property would yield about two- hundred and fifty thousand dollars,-which is more than half the whole general tax paid to the State. While I am still of opinion that this sum-could be beneficially used for the support of public schools, and that the system will at an early day be adopted by almost unanimous consent, I am inclined to think that so large a revenue drawn all at once for a new object would produce a hue and cry against the cause of popular education, fatal to its success. "I also entertain the belief that the people-I mean the unlettered masses-need preliminary training before they will embrace the plan of free schools. They must s     , H^ ,   WjT;i WU ts:SBFUL MAN.     93 have their minds wrought upon and influenced by a more tangible process than that of leading their children from the alphabet to the single rule of three, where the march is to end. I have an experiment which I think will find public favor, and I propose it as a substitute for the original bill. I send it to the clerk's table, that it may be read for the in- formation of the House. [Here the substitute was read, the nature of which we have explained.] We all know the effect of pictures on the mind of all, in making the most forcible impressions; and the kind that I propose are em- blematical of the great interests of society. "In regard to the expense, I have made a fair approxi- mation. The last census gives the number off families in the State at fifty thousand. I have no doubt the commis- sion can have this number of copies stricken off at sixteen cents per copy for each engraving, which will form a total cost of forty thousand dollars. The remaining ten thou- sand will be sufficient to pay for the distribution in the several counties, each family to be supplied at their own door. There are thousands of grown persons in the State who never saw a picture of any kind,-not even that of the Farmer, Lawyer, and Ox, and of the Milkmaid, in Web- ster's Spelling-Book. The figures and the moral are dis- tinctly impressed on my mind now, and will never be effaced by any galleries of art I may visit. "The pictures which I propose to scatter among the people are not valued as merchandise, or by any money- standard; for in this light they are trifles. But as suggest- ive of great ideas and duties, operating upon the mind and giving it a lively tone in the right direction, the benefit will be incalculable. Every morning, when a man rises, he will be put in a good humor by the school-children, the cattle, and the poultry, all represented in the engravings. Then the church will remind him of his devotions;-the ship, of the great ocean, and of the millions of people beyond it, with whom webhave commercial dealings. The machinery  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7248-00000048"/> "       WILKINS WYDER; OR, will teach the division of labor, and ought to reconcile every man to his own calling. Then the pretty cottage and flower- garden will lead the taste of thousands into a new channel, elevating the mind above the old vapors in which it has been chilled- and dwarfed. My word for it, this pictorial instruction will be the most potent and successful of any that could be devised, preparatory to the schools. It will open the way, and give you industrious, moral, and happy citizens. All that the people need is a fair chance, a kind word, and-'some proof that you feel interested in their welfare. Their souls will receive new light, and all their energies will be roused, into action. I wish to see our people solid and -practical in their pursuits, rather than stylish and imaginative. "Mr. Speaker, you could not have failed to observe that the gentleman from Columbia (Mr. Perkins) advanced an argu- ment, on the authority of Dr. Johnson, which reason itself condemns. I hope I shall never be -guilty of the rashness of advising my fellow-citizens to adopt any such notion. Strange indeed would it be were we so constituted that we must draw our delights from the past, which is nothing to us, or from the future, which we may never live to experience! Shall we, then, ignore the present, fold our hands, and let the only treasure we can improve or enjoy pass from us, lest we should be called unphilosophic.  The great differ- ence between the gentleman and myself is, that he is for educating the people to such a degree of refinement that they cannot relish the present, or even bring their minds to realize such a period, with its golden opportunities; but he would have them dream of what has been or may bet and thus fill their places on earth by a mere effort of the, imagination! I am afraid, sir, that our indolence is already too well established to require an additional motive to, sleep away the present. Let us have the opposite doctrine of activity and delight in the use of the present time. It is all that we can truly call our own. This will gain for   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.        93 -us future enjoyments, and is indeed the great secret of success. "The substitute I propose cannot give rise to such errors. It will inspire men, women, and children with a love of nature and truth. It will cause them to try their capacities, bodily and mental, to make all they pos- sibly can out of the present, the ever-glorious present, while the sun shines and music within gives joy to labor. Let us try the silent pictorial teachers, and, if they do not accomplish our wishes, we can send living instructors to give the mind that knowledge in possession, of which the pictures originated the desire. Each wave of excited cu- riosity, like the tides of the ocean, will spread from shore to shore, and future ages will bless your benefaction." No reply was made to Mr. Wylder. .His substitute was adopted; and in this form the bill passed by a large majority. It may be gratifying to know in what terms the "Ex- positor" alluded to the Education Bill and the passage of the pictorial substitute. The reader has the article, as follows:- "Mr Wylder's bill to establish public- schools called forth a new champion, Mr. Perkins; of Columbia, a decided and unflinching Graball, whose future is destined to be as successful as his speech was brilliant and unexpected. He had hitherto been a silentimember; but when the great interests of the people were involved, his abilities burst forth like a meteor -in the' horizon. We learn that his ' friends propose-him for Congress, since this exhibition of power. "Mr. Wylder, ever vigilant and patriotic, saw proper to offer a substitute for his own bill, requiring only one-fifth of the taxation, and calculated to do the same, if not a- greater, amount of good by a process the most effective in calling into exercise all the dormant emotions and faculties  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7248-00000049"/> 96       WILKINS WYDER; 'OR, of the mind. The substitute was adopted; and we have /  the pleasure of laying it before our readers to-day.. "The session is now drawing to a close, and we think it likely that no new bills will be introduced, for the reason that there will not be sufficient time remaining to act upon them in both branches of the General Assembly. We have endeavored to keep the proceedings well reported, and we trust that our labors will not be in vain. As a whole, the present session has been one of unusual interest; and; while there has been a great display of talent, no member has acqumred more influence, or rendered more service to the public, than Mr. Wylder, of Eranklin. We sincerely hope that his career may be long and prosperous." The question may be asked, How did Mr. Perkins meet Mr. Wylder after borrowing his thunder on the Education Bill? The wholes affair passed off pleasantly enough, and the authorship of the speech was held in confidence. Mr. Wylder ever-expressed his gratification at the joke, as it gave him an opportunity to abandon a somewhat hazard- ous experiment in taxation, for one more innocent and successful. Thus terminated the session. CHAPTER XV. ON returning to his father's mansion, (for that was his home,) Mr. Wylder was received by the family with great rejoicing. Dr.-Wylder had been a very attentive reader of the proceedings in the Legislature, in which his son had acted so creditable a part. Nor had the comments of editors and letter-writers, all acknowledging his abilities, escaped notice., To confess his mind frankly, Dr. Wylder had more than realized -his, expeetations, high as -they were, in the opening prospects of his son in public life. To Mrs. Wylder the conduct of her son had ever been a source of   \              \   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       97 unalloyed pleasure. From his infancy to manhood he had uniformly treated her with the most tender affection; and now that he was launched. in a new sphere in which, the eyes of the world were upon him and his praises sounding in every direction, she was overwhelmed with maternal joy. There was another member of the household equally dear, who was soon to create anxiety by the step about to be noticed. Miss Angelina Wylder had grown to woman- hood, with all the advantages which wealth and refinement usually bestow. Her education had been tlorough, and she was a reigning belle. True, her health was quite deli- cate; but she was dutiful to her parents, and of a loving nature to her friends. She had kindled in the bosom of Jerome Carson, a worthy young lawyer, an, excess of the tender passion which permitted him no rest until he had shut off the flame by declaring himself her lover. The courtship lasted several weeks, during which time Dr. Wylder had acquainted himself with the antecedents of the gentleman who sought the relation of his son-in-law. These were in all respects satisfactory. Mr. Carson was  allied to seve'al distinguished families well known to Dr. Wylder. His personal qualities were above objection. He was in his twenty-fourth year, with a growing practice to rely upon, besides liberal expectations from his father, who had a large property subject to division among his ten children. Thus supported, Mr. Carson won his fair prize,  T and preparations were about to be made for the nuptials.   r Mr. Carson resided some fifty miles from Wylder Hall,  Gu and had not formed the acquaintance of the family until   / the departure of Wilkins for the seat of government.  After the return of the latter, the introduction took place, too late, however, for him to have a voice in the domestic council when the fate of the lovers was decided. Wilkins, fortunately, was pleased with Mr. Carson, and showed him all the respect due his position in the family. They soon   &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7248-00000050"/> W!     ,  WILKINS WYDER; OR,   -  became intimate friends, and interchanged mutual confi- dence. It was a generous bond which united them. The one had already taken his rank as a debater and politician, and the other only needed the opportunity to do so.   j The wedding occasion passed off in a most agreeable manner, with a large company of friends and neighbors, among whom was the Rev. Ezra. Holton, the officiating priest at Hymen's altar. This gentleman gaye a very cor-  dial recognition of the merits of Wilkins in his public career, quite gratifying to the latter. No trace remained 3f the interview during the election canvass on the subject of treating, nor did Mr. Holton signify by word or look that the two-handled jug of whiskey, and its connection with a foul homicide, was an affair within his knowledge. Wilkins, by great exertion of will, had suffered his thoughts to be as little disturbed as possible by the occurrence; yet he could never banish it wholly from his mind. It was an intrusive spectre, and he often regretted that he had not taken Mr. Holton's advice. He soothed himself by the  reflection that the custom had been established by others before his day, and that he was innocently complying with what appeared to be the general wish of the people in this Pespect. At the particular request of Mr. Carson, his brother-in- law Wilkins accompanied him and his bride to Hampton, the residence of the, former. An entertainment in the form of a sumptuous dinner was given by Mr. Dodson, a wealthy friend and neighbor of Mr Carson. The occasion brought together a large number of the citizens, and that interesting portion of their families, young men and young women who would soon provoke other festivities of the like kind. Mrr Wylder was-known to most of them by reputation, and a very grateful round of civilities awaited V him. Frequent dinner and evening parties were gotten up for his special benofit, or, more truly speaking, for the possible benefit of some unmarried daughter or sister who was cap-   tivated by the personal appearance of Mr. Wylder, his rising prospects, and the wealth of his family. At all events, during the fortnight he passed at Hampton, he was i invitedto all the amusements of the town and its vicinity, including several deer and fox hunts, in which he acquitted himself gallantly as a patron of the chase. In one of these excursions, Mr. Wylder was thrown into companionship with Mr. Watkins Brown, an old and influ- enltial member of the Grahall party, who had served in the Legislature. Mr: Brown had not formed a very favorable opinion of Mr W. Wo' 'le opinion of Mnr. Wylder s political fidelity, After reading his resolutions. He looked upon them as a burlesque on the extravagant professions so common of late to all parties, and was inclined to censure Mr. Wylider for the liberty-he had taken. The subject was thus introduced between them. your. B.-,I hope, Mr. Wylder, you will not think hard of a political friend for complaining a little at your course in the Legislature,oespecially as you succeeded in throwing matters into confusion which it will take years to regulate. I speak of your resolutions affirming and amplifying the prineiples of the Graball party. Were you joking, or were you in earnest?" Mr. W .--"My dear Mr. Brown, I am glad you have asked me the question; for I should be sorry to leave you and other prominentmembers of the party under the impres- sion that I had trifled with its fortunes. I had no such design; and I think you will. approve when you learn my object. You know well that there has been more vapor and fog oast over Graball platforms by artful leaders, of re- cent origin, than was the case in former times. If they wanted  the foreign vote, they put in a plank about natu- ralization and equality; if they needed sectional favor, North or South, they put in tariff, free trade, public domain, anti-monopolies, constitutional currency, and all such tim - bers,  squared and fitted for the interests they aimed to please, for the sake of getting power. All this deception   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7248-00000051"/> 100       WILKINS WYDER; OR,           3 was too transparent not- to be seen through at a glance; and I turned upon it the batteries of ridicule for no other purpose than to reform such folly. The medicine will do its work, and you will live to change your opinion." Mt. B.- "Well, M1r. Wylder, whether I approve or not, I admit that you had just provocation to apply the knife. The party had- bragged itself out of breath and respecta- bility; but I had been so prepossessed that I never observed it before. I hope your blister will improve the health of the patient, and that your surgical skill will be rewarded by the vigor and success of Graballism in all the future."' Mr. W.-'This is the very object I had in view; and I only ask my political friends to bear with my experiment until another general election is had, to ascertain the i effects. We must drop all party clap-trap, and plant our- selves like honest men on principle, instead of expediency. Such is the path I have marked out for myself, whether I am sustained or not by the co-operation of others." Here the conversation ended in a most amicable spirit, each gentleman pleased. Mr. Brown, with perfect good humor, requested Mr. Wylder to furnish him with his figures showing a party gain in the contest after his reso- lutions had exerted their proper influence. Of course the favor could not be denied. A young widow, Mrs. Candelaria Jones, had made a fashionable call on the bride, and had accepted an invita- tion to tea, Mr. Wylder having previously notified his sister of his intention to return home the next morning. He was presented to the charming widow, who assumed her most wrinning ways to gain the admiration of Mr. Wylder, knowing that he was one of the very first prizes in the ma- trimonial lottery. The two were evidently attracted, and Mrs. Carson joked her brother on the solitude of celibacy anal the happiness of married life. He treated the jest gayly,--and excused his omission of duty on the ground that his partiality for the sex had never been -recil-   'procated. Here the widow protested that he lad been so taken up with party reform, as she judged from his resolu- tions and speeches in the Legislature, that he had never given the ladies a fair opportunity to bestow their suffrages. This shaft lodged in Mr. Wylder's heart, and he fairly quivered; but his philosophy came to his relief, and caused him. to adhere to his first determination, not to enslave his fitculties to love until he had tested their power for high achievements, so as to command the fairest lady to whom gallant knight ever did homage. Such was his golden dream, and he took refuge from the assaults of the widow behind this impenetrable armor. The farewell came. His sister kissed him affectionately, and sent messages of love to her parents, and to her brother Edward, who was the minor consolation now left in the household. Mr. Wylder took tender leave, not forgetting to assure his brother-in-law that the felicity which he and his sister enjoyed was a forcible argument in behalf of matrimony, and that he was already more than half con; vinced. At least, he requested the, young couple to keep an eye to his happiness, and let him be duly advised. On arriving at the paternal home, Mr. Wylder was greeted with the usual/ffection. He related his enjoy- ments, and expatiated n the good fortune of his sister in marrying a man worthyof her love and of the confidence of the family. He informed his parents that the bridal reception was of the mos"aa  nable kind, attended by a large company of the friends of the bridegroom, who in turn lavished civilities on him, Wilkins, by giving sundry  dinner and tea parties in honor of his visit. His political reputation was also well established in that quarter of the State, and every thing contributed to render his trip one of the most agreeable of his reminiscences. 9*   &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7248-00000052"/> 102       WILKINS WYDER; OR, CHAPTER XVI.  DURING the absence of Mr. Wylder on his visit to Hamp. ton, his father received a letter from Mr. Wells. It was the first communication he had sent to the family since his departure from Wylder Hall. "NEW YORK, January 1, 18-.  "DEAR SIR:-I-have been a careful reader of the news-  papers from your State, and feel much satisfaction at the success of your son Wilkins in the Legislature. With his politics, right or wrong, I have no concern, having resolved to stand aloof from all such matters. But, the relation of tutor and pupil having so long existed between us, I can- not refrain from indulging a just pride in the talents which he has displayed thus early in public life. I consider his r futurftattering to the loftiest ambition. I do not arro- gate to myself any superiority in letters or in science; but if he will carry out in practice the lessons which he received from me in the course of his education, and exer- cise the courage, patience, and self-control necessary to form a truly great character, he will accomplish your fondest desires, and be an honor to his country. I think the moral foundation is well laid; and certainly his beginning has been auspicious. It only remains for him to set his mark high, and work up to it. "Since I left your family, I have been in a state of tran- sition, abiding but a short time at any one place. This method of passing my time has had a most agreeable effect upon my health and spirits. While in charge of your son, though I had every accommodation which heart could wish   I was so deeply concerned in his welfare, in watching the development of his faculties and dispositions, and in applying the proper discipline without betraying my anxiety, that I failed to enjoy that mental repose so essential to perfect hap- piness. 'It is my design to pass the remainder of my life in seclusion, having just means enough, with proper enonomy, to live in comfort. To the five thousand dollars you paid me on final settlement, I have added half that sum from my previous earnings, the interest on which will suffice; and the principal I shall bequeath to some useful purpose when I shall cease to need it. "My intention is to leave fqr Europe in a few weeks, and to settle in my fatherland, Germany. Its university seats will afford me all the pleasures I can desire in the indulgence of my peculiar tastes and habits. I shall not seek any chair of instruction, being now a little too ad- vanced in age to perform the labors profitably to the scholars and with self-approbation. "When I review my employment, and recall the many social gratifications I have had in America, and especially my residence of eight years in your family, I feel sincere reluctance in leaving the shores of this noble country, never to return. But I shall never cease to think of you and yours with grateful sensibility. He who was once  Master Wilkins, consigned to my care, and who fulfilled his obligations with so much pXopriety, has before him a career which will increase my own happiness, while, I  trust, it will advance his own. I do not know whether he  has settled himself, or is still under your roof, planning his matrimonial future. I beg you to represent to him the \earnest solicitude I feel in his fortunes, and that his pro-  motion to the hihest honors of the land will be hailed by nme in another hemisphere with parental delight; for he came the nearest of being to- me a son, from our con- fidential relations, of any person in my whole ac- quaintance.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7248-00000053"/> 104       WILKINS WYDER; OR,  "The members of your household are yet vivid in my   I recollection. To say nothing of the grace and urbanity with which you discharged your trust as the honored head, I think with pleasure of Mrs. Wylder and her excellent qualities, -of Miss Angelina, Master Edward, and also Miss Guyon, your sister-in-law, whose strange fancy led her from your house under circumstances which grieved you at the tinme. I have not since heard of her, and should qmch regret if her experience has been as painful as you apprehended from the rash course she pursued in defiance of your entreaties. I witnessed the troubles caused by her elopement; and I should rejoice to learn that in the sequel her choice has been more eligible than the flippant manners of Dr. Ringford would signify. I fully concurred with you in the opinion J that he was a vain upstart, without honor, and one of   those plausible men who take unusual pains to conceal their defects by cultivating false appearances. He was a I splendid example of the kind; and my fear is that his con- \ fiding victim will suffer the penalty of her obstinate reso- lution. Whatever misery awaits her, your conscience will approve the part yoll/acted in the affair to prevent the ruin. "On reflection, I may have gone too far in this comment on Miss Guyon, which may possibly be disagreeable to your family; but I astayour indulgence, from the fact that I can never separate myself from a lively interest in whatever relates to your happiness and that of your domestic circle. My best regards to Mrs. Wylder and your children, whilst I remain       Truly your friend, THEO. WELLS." Another letter came to Dr. Wylder by the samfe mail which brought the preceding, though it was of prior date. It will be looked upon as a melancholy record, inculcating a lesson of peculiar value in affairs of the heart. No fur- ther preface is necessary to its introduction. f L   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       105 "NEW YORK, Dec. 25, 18-. 1"MY DEAR DR. WYDER:-At this merry period, while the sleigh-bells are heard, and a joyous multitude are thronging the streets, I have nerved my heart to the dis- agreeable task of bringing myself to your recollection, after six years of absence and misfortune have probably caused my name to be despised, if not forgotten, at Wylder Hall. . I do not ask forgiveness for my self-will and disre- gard of your friendly caution. Oh, how I have suffered within the last six years! I entreat your pity. When I relate the history of my sorrows, it will be impossible for you to refuse the boon I crave. "I1 will begin with my situation in your family, where 1 had every comfort and the purest affection to .soothe me. I then had abundant cause of happiness; but I did not so view it, though I had more experience than I was willing to confess. From folly or perverseness which I could never comprehend in1 myself, I rejected several good offers in marriage soon after I grew to womanhood. I was vain and ambitious. My fortune I knew was large, and my family influential; and it flattered my pride to keep my suitors at my feet, between hope and despair. I acted with the imperious manner of a queen, looking on my advantages Gas almost equal to a crown,t;o authorize my conduct. ' During all this time, when I was the centre of attraction, I cherished high resolves, and demanded what was impos- sible,-a lover of such refinement, chivalry, and talents, as the books of romance described. I took my ideas from -this source, and could never be persuaded of the illusion. Consequently, no one came up to my standard, and I refused to accept less. My suitors gradually forsook. me. I had secured the name of a heartless coquette,-of a woman who would trifle with the happiness of others to gratify. her own vanity. Thus did I become what is called an old mnaid, -a condition, whether from choice or necessity, reproached by the world.   .   &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7248-00000054"/> 106      WILKINS WYDER,; OR,  "My estates, when turned over to me by my guardian after I had attained lawful age, were valued at sixty thou- sand dollars, about a fourth of which consisted of bank- stock. I managed my property so as to leave a net income after all my expenses. Nothing appeared to me more cer-  tain than that the trouble would soon be taken off my hands by some gallant cavalier, of whom specimens could be seen in the books, if not in society-  "While on a visit to my sister at Wylder Hall, I formed ! the acquaintance of Dr. Ringford. When preparing the invitations to a party you gave me, you objected to the  name of this gentleman which I had placed on the list. Your language was decided; but mine in opposition was equally so. I prevailed, and the doctor was invited; but  on the assembling of the guests you omitted to recognise { him. I atoned for the incivility by giving him the largest  share of my attentions during the evening. He oame up to my ideal of a gentleman, a true cavalier; and when he proposed for my hand, I did not hesitate to bestow it. Aware- of your feelings, I contrived to elude your vigilance, and became his wife. With the particulars of the affair you have been to some extent informed. What I now com- municate, you could never know except from myself. "After the ceremony of marriage, Dr, Ringford and my- self took a public coach until we reached Lunaville, in the vicinity of my estates. Here we remained only a few days, as we had agreed to spend the honeymoon at the North. I drew a check for two thousand dollars on the bank, and he received the money. In the mean time, I had notified my manager of the new ownership of the property, and had given Dr. Ringford full possession. I also apprized the officers of the'bank of my marriage, and gave them the signature of my husband, so that they might not be imposed on by false checks; By virtue of his marital rights, he was entitled to my deposites in bank without any special orders to the cashier; but, to render   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       107 the transaction agreeable, I thought proper to delegate the authority in person. "Some of my relatives and neighbors on the coast seemed pleased at the marriage, treating Dr. Ringford with marked respect. Many of them congratulated me on my happy selection. We went from Charleston to New York by one of the steam-packets, and took rooms at the City Hotel, on Broadway. A grand party was given me by the pro- prietors in the course of a week. I found that Dr. Ring- ford could sustain himself among polished and leading people. He frequently brought to our parlor, to dinner or tea, or merely to make my acquaintance, some of the chief importers and bankers of the city. They conversed in my presence on the success which Dr. Ringford had in stock speculations; how that 'Erie' had advanced so as to make him a clear profit of twenty thousand dollars, and that 'Brooklyn' and 'Jersey' were safe investments, of which he had purchased largely. Some of the best houses in the foreign trade had offered to make him a partner, which would require a cash capital on his part of fifty thousand dollars. These were some of the topics casually touched /upon by our visitors. "We had a private table; and, when we saw proper, a, friend or two could be invited, without any formal arrange- ments with the proprietor. When Dr. Ringford wished to entertain a greater number, he usually gave notice before- hand, so'that suitable preparations might be made. In this way our time passed off agreeably at the hotel. We visited the opera, theatres, and other places of amusement; saw Cooper, Booth, Forrest, Kemble, Power, Finn, Hackett, Wood, Adams, and other distinguished actors; Celeste in the Maid of Cashmere, Fanny Kemble, Clara Fisher, Jose- phine Clifton, Mrs. Barnes, and the like female celebrities oi the stage. Every thing that could contribute to my happiness or to the gratification of my curiosity was at my command. Dr. Ringford was fortuate in his financial   &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7248-00000055"/> 108       WILKINS WYDER; OR, operations, and had the prospect of becoming a million. naire. To expedite this result, he ordered a- sale of the bank-stock he obtained by marriage, and thlat a check for the proceeds, not less than fifteen thousand dollars, should be forwarded to him at New York. This sum he received,' and at once placed in the importing-house of which he became a member. "The cards of the firm, printed for distribution, read, Clawson, Ringford, Wolfe &amp; Co., Importers of Fancy Goods, Silks, Laces, &amp;ec., 308 Pearl Street, New York. I was de- lighted at my husband's connection with this old and respectable house. The partners were known to be re- liable men, and Southern merchants made large bills with them. In the course of a single day, thirty, thousand dol- lars' woith of goods was sold, at an advance of ten per cent, making three thousand dollars clear profit, one-fourth of which, or seven hundred and fifty dollars, was the share of Dr. Ringford. He assured me that this was frequently the case, and that his profits could be increased by putting more money into the joint capital. For this object, he directed his plantations and other property to be sold for cash, or bankable paper at ninety days. The proceeds amounted to seventy-two thousand dollars. His deposites in bank were eight thousand more, making eighty thousand dollars brought him in drafts -and bills on New York, which were discounted by the banks, less the forward inte- rest. Including my check for two thousand, and the bank- stock for fifteen thousand, Dr. Ringford realized in clear cash, by his marriage, ninety-seven thousand dollars. I regretted that the sale had not been so managed as to yield the round sum of one hundred thousand dollars, as a voluntary offering on my part to the noble young man who had appreciated my good qualities and rescued mt from my solitary position. "Such was the scale of business, aside from the indi- vidual risks in the stock exchange, which uniformly turned x.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       109 out well for Dr. Ringford. His profits were usually from eight hundred to a thousand dollars per day, and never less than five hundred, out of which he had to bear our expenses at the hotel, which were two hundred and fifty dollars per month, for a private parlor, dressing-room, and table-sup- plies,-all of the first quality. This sum ran up our board- bill to three thousand dollars a year.. Then we had to pay for carriage-hire, pleasure-parties, our costly wearing-ap- parel, amusements, charities, pew at church, &amp;c. about seven thousand dollars more, making in all ten thousand dollars for our support. This was apparently a large sum; but, when the income to which I have referred was taken into the account, the expenses were very moderate. In fact, we could not have maintained a style suitable to our rank in society for less money. The partners of Dr. Ring- ford assured him that their family expenses were much greater, except Mr. Wolfe, who was an old bachelor and by rigid parsimony lived-on four thousand a year. "These things came to my knowledge in conversations between the gentlemen and Dr. Ringford, when I was pre- sent. [ I was invited No many public balls; but, from some cause, I was omitted at all private entertainments. On my expressing surprise, Dr. Ringford explained that in the very highest classes of the city no' person was ever ad- mitted whose fortune was less than a million of dollars,- that he was rapidly striding to that point, and then the magnificent drawing-rooms of Bond Street would fly open, as if by magic, to receive us on terms of social equality. Our third year had brought him half-way, and he expected in two years more to complete the transition. Then we should be as high in prerogative as mortals ever attain, short of a sceptre and a crown. "I frequently asked Dr. Ringford to take me to his store, and let me see the French silks, Brussels lave, Cashmere shawls, English hosiery,. Irish linens, Scotch ginghams, German damask,, &amp;c., of which I had heard him speak 10  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7248-00000056"/> "O       WILKINS WYDER; OR,           3 when the invoices were opened. He replied that it was a wholesale establishment, and that all the goods were in l cases, or bales, or large packages, which were never opened until there was a purchaser; but if I chose to see samples, he would bring me a variety, from which I could select any piece I wanted. He would buy a whole piece for me at any time, which he had th  oto. do- at original cost. The partners were allowed this privilege in goods for ltheir J private use. Another reason why la'dies never visited wholesale stores, was, that there was generally a crowd of merchants from the West, or the South, or from the Middle States, who required all the force of the establishment to I wait upon them. The counters were filled with broken packages, and the floors were occupied in boxing up the goods sold. Ladies would only be in the way, without being able to see the articles. "And thus I passed into my fourth year in the metro- polis, happy with my- husband and in his rapid prosperity. He was the very model of a refined gentleman,-dressed fashionably, and was always select in his companions. His moral propriety I never had the least cause to question. His attentions to me were as cordial and delicate as any wife could desire from the most devoted husband. Such was the state of things when the fourth year after mar- riage was ushered in. The horizon then changed its brightness, and clouds began to appear. Of the descent from my elevation it is unnecessary to give particulars. Dr. Ringford received from me ninety-seven thousand dol- lars in cash; and for this he supplied me with comfortable rooms at the City Hotel, showed me the sights of New York, and furnished me fine clothing for the term of four years, without a word of complaint on either side. It was four years of harmony, of confidence 6n my part, and of seeming good fortune. But the- sun of my happiness was eclipsed, and has never passed from the dark shadow. "At the end of four years, the facts became as clear to   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       1" my mind as demonstration itself, that Dr. Ringford had never been a dealer in stocks, nor a partner of any corn. mercial house, nor had he an income from any quarter. Those bankers, merchants, and chiefs of Wall Street whom he brought to the hotel were regular Peter Funks, fixed up to deceive me, so that I might have no suspicion of foul play in selling my estates and using'my bank-stock and deposites. These Peter Funks were notorious blacklegs and swindlers, who dressed fine, with much jewelry on their persons; and to each of them had been assigned a part to bamiNozle me. The plot was laid and the dialogue rehearsed beforehand/ to work upon my understanding The swindlers triumphed. For the last two years I have not seen Dr. Ringford, nor any of his companions, the Messrs. Funk. They have all disappeared. Dr. Ringford r took leave of me in the most affectionate manner the morn- ing he sailed for Europe in the ship 'Garrick,' to lay in a stock of foreign goods for his house. Nothing has since been heard of him. In some two months thereafter, when he should have returned with his fresh importations, I stroled -up Pearl Street and looked for No. 308. On the sign over the door I read, 'Gilkey, Batson &amp; Co., Dealers in ABoots and Shoes.' The card which guided me to this spot was printed for my inspection alone, and was never circu- lated beyond the Funks and     swindlers, who no doubt laughed heartily at the successful trick they had practised on me. "But, wicked and ungrateful as he is, I must do Dr. Ringford the justice to say that he played the gentleman to the last. When he came to fold me in his arms, on his de- parture for Eropefhe said, 'Dearest Mary, I expect to be gone about two months. Here is five hundred dollars to pay our landlord, if he requires so much. Perhaps he may be willing to-make some deduction for my  absence: if so) you will have a little pocket-money left,' He then counted out ten fifty-dollar bills on the Bank of America, and  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7248-00000057"/> "2     '  WILKINS WYDER; OR , handed them to me. This was the last of my ninety-seven thousand dollars that I was permitted to touch.   - "In a few days after the doctor set out, I saw the folly of keeping a private parlor and separate table for i my use, at so heavy an expense, and resolved to dispense with all, except a small bedroom' for myself, and to take my meals at the ladies' ordinary. I made known my desire to Mr. Wilbraham, the proprietor, and asked him 'i for such accommodations as would not exceed fifty dollars i a month until Dr. Ringford's return. To this he assented; and I continued my lodgings two months, until I made the discovery at No. 308 Pearl Street. I then paid Mr. Wil- braham one hundred dollars for my board, and without any explanation left the hotel. I went into cheap Quarters, No. 387 Fourth Street, with a very excellent widow who kept ,a private boarding-house. Frequently I have been of service to her in lending her money when she was hard pressed for rent. I have been with her for nearly the last two years, and am with her still, having only five dollars left of the four hundred I retained after paying the hotel. This is the bitter experience and unhappy' condition. of M. GUYON RINGFORD." CHAPTER XYIIL THE letter from Mrs. Ringford disarmed Dr. Wylder of V% all his avowed indifference to her fate after she had sacri- ficed herself i? spite of his remonstrances. . He now de- termined' to relieve her in so gentle a manner that she should feel like doing him a favor, instead of being indebted to his generosity for deliverance. Mrs. Wylder was deeply affected at the sorrows of her sister. She made no sug- gestion in her behalf, knowing that what was proper would be done without delay. Wilkins offered to visit   THE SUCCESSFUL IMAN.      113 New York, and accompany his aunt back to the South. But, having some doubt in his mind whether such a step would be agreeable to her, knowing her ancient pride and eccentricity, Dr. Wylder determined to approach her in a different way. He knew that Mr. Wells was in New  York, and that a message through him would accomplish more than any thing else toward soothing her mortified feelings. She would then feel as if 'in the presence of the inmates of Wylder Hall, having for years seen Mr. Wells as one of the family, high in their, confidence and training for distinction the favorite of the house. Accordingly, Dr. Wylder wrote the following letter to Mr. Wells:-- "WYDER HALL, Feb. 1, 18--. "DEAR SIR:-I thank you for your obliging letter of 1st ult. Your kind sentiments are highly valued in my family, all of whom have heard the expression with gra- titude, except my daughter, who married and left us a few weeks ago. My son-in-law, Mr. Carson, resides at Hampton, some fifty miles hence. Wilkins has just re- turned from  the bridal journey, and gives a good account. He was almost entrapped by the charms of a gay young widow, whose imag   still lingers in his dreams. If you dislike these symptoms, you must give him your mind, as he will always respect your advice. I could say a number of little things of a domestic nature, which might interest yoa as our common friend; but, as I have another topic to press, I will at once proceed to it. "I enclose the copy of a letter I have lately received from my sister-in-law, on whose strange conduct you justly animadvert. You will see that she resides at No. 387 Fourth Street, in the city of New York, where I hope this letter will find you. Herein is a check for five hundred dollars, which I beg you to hand her, and to inquire at what time it will be agreeable to her to joiq hexy friends in the South. Whenever she is ready to come to us, a proper - H          o10  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7248-00000058"/> "4       WILKINS WYDER; OR, escort will be provided,-perhaps her nephew, Wilkins, your late pupil, who would be delighted with the op- portunity of seeingyou again before your departure for Europe, if he can reach the city in time:. You will please notify me of your interview with my relative, and your views of the conspiracy which has defrauded her out of a large estate, and whether there is any chance to proceed against the conspirators for the crime. I have no idea of any civil action, as I would hate ib contend with such mature villany. If you think propeli'you-can submit Mrs. Ringford's statement to eminent counsel, T'f whose compen- sation I will answer. Respect for thc aidministration of justice requires that cognizance should be thken of such an extensive act of swindling, persevered in step by step for years, until it was finally consummated, to the ruin of a misguided but high-toned woman. I leave much to your discretion, while I remain, dear sir, yours truly, ANDREW WYDER." This letter reached Mr. Wells the day before he was to sail for Europe. He had already engaged his passage. Within an hour after getting Dr. Wylder's letter and en- closures, he called at'No. 387 Fourth Street, between the Bowery and Broadway, and inquired for Mrs. Ringford. The qervant announced his name to that lady, who sent word that she would soon see him in the parlor. Whep she entered, Mr. Wells expressed himself happy to meet with an old acquaintance from the South. Mrs. Ringford was calm and respectful, and desired to know how Mr. Wells had learned her address. He informed her, at the same time handing her the check for flye hundred dollars, which she examined, and then burst into tears. Mr. Wells saw the propriety of ending the interview, that she might indulge her feelings in privacy. He only inquired whether'it would be agreeable to her to return South in the company of her nephew, Wilkins Wylder, or any other confidential  ,I   friend. If such was her pleasure, he was authorized to say that no time would be lost in providing the escort. This offer seemed to renew her emotion; and she replied, with a broken voice, "God bless Dr. Wylder for his noble spirit! I resign myself into his hands." Mr. Wells assured her that she would soon be with her friends, and desired her not to change her residence without giving him notice at Lovejoy's, opposite the Park, where he should remain until he heard from Dr. Wylder. He then took his-leave. Mr. Wells immediately wrote to Dr. Wylder as follows:- "NEW YOIx, Feb. 9, 18-, "DEAR SIR:-This morning your letter of 1st instant was received, covering a check for five hundred dollars, and the copy of a letter from Mrs. Ringford. Within the next hour I saw that lady, handed her the check, and gave her friendly assurances if she desired to return South. She was deeply touched by your kindness, and, with sob- bing voice, exclaimed, 'God bless Dr. Wylder for his noble spirit'! I resign myself into his han'ds.' She is at a very genteel and comfortable house. I would advise you to send on Wilkins without delay, and with his aid I can have the whole swindling operation investigated by the police, preparatory to an indictment in the Superior Court against the guilty conspirators. "i shall defer my voyage to Europe until I hear from you; and then my course will be influenced by the service I can render in this affair with the police. Thus far I have kept silent, and shall await the arrival of Wilkins to deter- mine what steps shall be taken. As an inducement, say to him that his visit here will be marked by testimonials of which he has not dreamed. So much for being a public man, and the author of the resolutions, a speech, &amp;c. I will give him a key to St. Andrew's Hall, where politicians 'most do congregate.' My dutiful regards to your family. "Yours sincerely,    THEO. WELLS."  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7248-00000059"/> "6       WILKINS WYDER; OR, The next day after this letter was read at Wylder Hall, a trunk marked "W. W." was sent to the stage-office, and the owner of that baggage paid for a through-ticket to New York. Without loss of time, Wilkins Wylder pressed forward, by coach and steamboat, till on the seventh day (then a very quick passage) he registered his name at Lovejoy's, in New York, where he found his old tutor ex- pecting his arrival. - The'omeeting was pleasant enough, and many little shreds of neighborhood gossip eked out in conversation. After retiring to his room, Wilkins came out handsomely dressed for a call on his aunt, to relieve her mind as to the future. Obtaining the address, he was soon in her presence. She was quite cheerful, and made no allusion to her misfortunes. Inquiries were made and information given about family matters, the marriage of Angelina, Wilkins's visit to Hampton, and the agreeable concomitants. Mrs. Ringford told her nephew that she would return with him whenever it suited his convenience, and that she was very grateful for the opportunity. She then called Mrs. Adams, the landlady, to whom she introduced Mr. Wylder. The five-hundred-dollar check had given a good report of the blood, and Mrs. Adams would be happy to place the best room in her house at his command during his stay in the city. He thanked her, and said he had already engaged a room at Lovejoy's, so as to have the society of his old tutor, who was soon to leave for Europe. They would have only a few days to spend together, and the hotel would be the most suitable head-quarters for two pedestrians who might not be regular enough for table-hours in a family. The force of this explanation was admitted; but Mr. Wylder was pressed to call fre- quently, which he promised to do. He then took his leave. ^ At night, Mr. Wells and Mr. Wylder had a long conver- sation about the swindlers, and how it was best to proceed.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       117 Who the parties were, what were their fictitlous or real names, or their ostensible pursuits, or on what street or square of the city they quartered themselves, neither of them knew; nor was it probable that Mrs Ringford could en- lighten them in this respect. They did not wish to mention their design to that lady until they had taken the initiative and were likely to start the game, as she would shrink from the position of a public witness in which it might be necessary to place her. It was apprehended that, to save herself from a newspaper notoriety on the trial, she would discourage the prosecution. Mr. Wylder knew his father's purpose to drag the conspirators from their dens and to inflict on them the full measure of legal retribution, whatever it might be. He therefor determined to consult High-Constable Hays, who was famous for his secret policy and invincible courage in the pursuit of such characters. No better statement could be given than the language of M3rs. Ringford, a copy of whose letter was laid before the high-constable. He begged permission to retain it until he could discover some key to the plot,-informing Mr. Wylder at the same time that it was possible the hive might be smoked out. As he progressed, he would casually drop in at the hotel for a wink or a word with Mr. Wylder. He begged that the subject might not be mentioned to any one else, as secrecy was a great advantage in such- matters. Messrs. Wells and Wylder, once more restored to each other's society, began their old habits of ramibling and 1 sight-seeing. They visited the Navy-Yard at Brooklyn, the principal ship-yards on East River, the glass-factories in Jersey City, the carriage-factories of Newark, the iron- foundries for steamboat machinery, Peale's Museum on Broadway, the Zoological Institute, the Fair of the Mecha- nics' Institute at Niblo's, and the Academy of Design; at- tended the exhibitions of the blind on Chatham Square, and sundry concerts, at two of which they heard, Russell sing his favorite pieces,-a style of music half recitative and half  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7248-00000060"/> "8     . WILKINS WYDER; OR, melody, rendered very affective by his rich baritone voice. In fact, our; friends were much on the wing, and. made good use of theirstime in viewing the harbor, and the iniles of shipping.,at the wharves. They also visited Greenwood, and mused among the gorgeous works of art in that city of the dead. They took passage in a steamboat to Albany, to view the beautiful scenery on the Hudson. The Catskill Mountains, the view at West Point, and other imposing objects, afforded them great satisfaction. But the most-gratifying moments were those passed at the hotel, in conversation at table, with their bill of fare before them, from which they could-order dishes at leisure. Mr. Wells there assumed an entirely new character: his  i face brightened, his eyes beamed, with genius, and all the faculties of his soul were brought into genial action. They'continued for hours to converse together in this way. Mr. Wylder, during his pupilage, had many proofs of the learning and generosity of his tutor; but he had never so fully comprehended him,-for the reason, perhaps, that his i own mind was not sufficiently prepared for the exhibition. Now that he had won laurels in the Senate, and had esta- blished a reputation for strong intellect and honest prin- ciples, of whose triumph his tutor was a most gratified witness, the change of manner could well be accounted for. Mr. Wylder ventured to suggest the new phase whichi he had seen in the emotions of his friend, and to ask the cause of it. Mr. Wells then referred to the table-conversations which he had heard in Germany, between some of the most emi- nent scholars of the last century, among whom  were Goethe, Klopstock, Gessner, Koch, Oberlin, Herder, Lava- ter, Berger, Eschenburg, Grossmann, Griesbach, Heyne, Huber, Stilling, Litchenburg, Schlosser, Stollberg, Voss, Zimmerman, and other men of letters. Many of these were professors, and the occasion of hearing them to the best advantage was at the delivery of their lectures to the ,    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.  4     119 Medical and Literary classes of the University. They all made impressions on him which Mr. Wells could never for- get. He had read their biographies; and the memoir of Goethe, written by himself, had inspired him with admira- tion and delight. Soon, Mr. Wells said, he -was to separate from his former pupil, and the chances were against their seeing each other any more in this life. WhiYe calling up these authors and men of genius, whose labors had fiflu- enced the world, Mr. Wells said he desired to associate with i their memories the name of his friend Wylder, who was a kindred spirit and had drunk from the same fountain of excellence. He was going back to his native country to -die among its honored relics, and his proudest recollections of America would be those which related to' Wylder Hall and-the pupil who was eight years under his charge. Mr. Wylder was much affected by the latter remark,-perceiving which, Mr. Wells suggested a stroll to the Battery for a change of air. In a day or two the high-constable dropped in at Love- joy's, and looked about on strange faces, as was his custom, without attracting particular observation; for he did not wear any badge to notify the public of his official character. Mr. Wylder stepped in at the moment, when a significant look was exchanged. This led the parties into a small chamber for consultation. Mr. Hays related his interviews with Mr. Wilbraham, of the City Hotel, from whom he had received a description which he recognised as that of two noted individuals who had before passed through his hands. One of them had been an accomplice in a murder, and his life was spared on his turning State's evidence. The con- stable well understood how to approach him, how to read his countenance and sift the indications of guilt. The experiment had been successful. One of the conspirators had confessed all the facts, and would give testimony when called upon, on condition that he should not be punished. The constable made the promise, enjoined secrecy until  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7248-00000061"/> 120       WILKINS WYDER; OR, further proceedings, and stated the path was now clear. All that was necessary was a warrant in due form against the parties, who could at any time be arrested for exami- nation. Before he took any formal step, Mr. Wylder submitted the facts to Mr Van Hooten, a distinguished lawyer on Nassau Street; whose opinion was explicit as to the crime having been completed. The necessary papers were then issued, and placed in the hands of High-Constable Hays. The next morning there appeared before Recorder Riker three prisoners, arrested by the high-constable under a I warrant issued upon the affidavit of Wilkins Wylder, Esq., charging Louis Raffles, John Sharke, and Elkins Holder with the offence of conspiracy and swindling. The accused parties were represented by Hoffman Norris, Esq., a skilful advocate. For the prosecution Marcus Van Hooten, Esq., had his name entered, and announced himself ready; as also did the other counsel, to proceed with the examination. The only witness sworn was Jasper Slinke, who stated a number of facts going to show the truth of the charge. The recorder observed that if counsel were disposed to  argue any question before him, he was ready to hear them; but he made it a rule to' bind the parties over for trial in the Superior Court when a prima facie case of guilt had been made out like the present. Messrs. Van Hooten and Norris declining to make any argument, the recorder di- rected the prisoners to give bail in the sum of two thousand dollars each, or, on failure, to stand committed until the action of the grand jury.. Failing to give satisfactory bail, the prisoners were marched to the Tombs, where they were locked up inseparate cells. Thus nded the first act of the drama. ,           9*   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       121 CHAPTER XVIII. THE Superior Court being in session, "true bills" were immediately returned by the grand jury against the pri- soners. A day was appointed for the trial in the ensuing week, and all the parties occupied themselves in making preparations. In the "Evening Star," the following edi- torial paragraph appeared, under the head of ("Criminal Calendar :" "In the Superior Court, held in the City Hall for the Fifth District, Judge Vanderpool presiding, true bills were this morning returned by the grand jury against Louis Raffles, John Sharke, and Elkins Holder, for conspiracy and swindling.. The case has been set down for trial on Thursday next. The Attorney-General is assisted by Marcus Van Hooten, Esq.; and Hoffman Norris, Esq., appears for the accused. "Without venturing to express an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoners, we think it due to the public that the nature of the charge should at least be stated. The information we have . received is to this effect. About six years ago, an individual calling himself Dr. Charles Ringford married a lady of rank in the South, and brought her to this city. He had a very plausible address, was convivial in his habits, and formed associa- tions which ended in the loss of his wife's property, amounting to ninety-seven thousand dollars in cash. - The history of this transaction will develop one of the most artfully-contrived schemes of fraud and swindling ever accomplished in this city of singular crimes." A copy of the paper containing this notice fell into the "  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7248-00000062"/> 122       WILKINS WYDER; OR, hands of Mrs. Ringford, on Fourth Street. She betrayed great anxiety of mind, and immediately addressed a note to Mr. Wylder, in the following terms:- "Friday evening. "DEAR NEPHEW :-If you are not too much engaged, I would be glad to see you after tea. My object is to ascer- tain the meaning of an article in the 'Star,' in which certain parties are said to be indicted for conspiracy and swindling. Perceiving the name of Dr. Ringford and the amount of my fortune mentioned, I suppose action has been taken to bring the guilty wretches to justice. If you are prepared to assure me that I shall not be called as a witness, you may come without legal advice; but, if you cannot give me this assurance, I beg of you the favor to take the opinion of counsel as to the extreme indelicacy of exposing me to public observation, and by all means to have me excused from giving evhIence, even if the pro- secution should fail without it. I do not think that my nerves can stand the shock,--especially after th'e comments of the press on my appearance, voice, language, and even the color of my hair, the length of my nose, or the form of my lips. All these liberties -are usually taken with ladies who are so unfortunate as to be drawn into court under the gaze of a vulgar multitude. I hope that my protest will not be in vain. Yours, affectionately, M. GUYON RINGFORD." 1 Mr. Wylder called on his aunt, as she requested, when a conversation took place between them, of which the following is the substance:- Mrs. R.-"You have seen the statement in the paper about the loss of my property and the prosecution of the swindlers. I take it for granted that the proceedings are at your instance; and I beg to know if you have not sufficient control over them to relieve me from being a witness."   TIIE SUCGESSFUL MAN.      123 [Mr. W.-"I have taken the opinion of counsel, at your request, and am authorized to say that if the witness who will be first introduced for the prosecution shall be unim- poached, you will not be called. But if the defence shall think proper to attack his credit on the ground that he was one of the conspirators, it will be necessary to have your statement, to see whether or not he is corroborated. The test will be complete, as you will not be apprized of thefacts to which he has testified; and if your evidence is the same in substance, the court and jury will believe him; otherwise they will not." Mars. R.--"I see the point, and have to yield to the necessity. It will be a very disagreeable scene to pass through., My estate can never be reclaimed, I know. The loss of it grieves me sorely enough, and my being the wife of a profligate adventurer sets a mark of reproach on me whichI must endure, .but to be heralded in the newspapers all over the land, with a minute description of my person and misfortunes, is, to my mind, a much greater calamity. I am afraid my sensibilities will destroy either my health or my reason,--will send me to the grave or to a lunatic- asylum." Mr. W..-"You must discard all such notions. Be calm and resolute: you will be like pure gold tried in the crucible, the better for the refining ptocess.  Pardon, my  dear aunt, the remark, which I make in kindness. You will know more of yourself, and of your duty in life, after you shall have gone through the ordeal, than your confiding nature would allow  without it. Really, you are to be benefited by it, as I hope you will have ultimate cause to acknowledge. So long as your friends are faithful and loving, as I know them to be, I beg you to pay no attention to the foolish remarks of the unfeeling herd.  The future will scatter more flowers in your path- way than you now imagine. You have been chastened only for your good. Be tranquil, and trust yourself in  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7248-00000063"/> 124       WILKINS WYDER; OR, my hands. I will be with you in the court-room, and see that your feelings are duly respected."! Mrs. R.-"I am convinced it will be" useless for me to ob- ject any longer: so I will take your advice, my dear Wilkins, and lean upon your strong will and valiant arm in this trying scene. May justice and truth have free course, and the law be fully vindicated. I never thought it possible that I should be involved in such a proceeding." The day of trial arrived, andthe prisoners were placed in the dock. They were all to abide the same issue, and pleaded "not guilty." The jury was selected, and the Attorney- General opened the case, read the indictment, and called Jasper Slinke to the witness-box, who, being sworn, was examined for the prosecution.  Questioan.-"What is your name, age, and occupation? Where do you reside?" Answer.--"My name is Jasper Slinke, my age twenty- seven years, and I am a tinker by trade. I lodge at lNo. 216 Greenwich Street." Q.-"Are you-acquainted with the prisoners at the bar'? If so, point them out respectively by name." A.--"The man to the left in the dock is Elkins Holder; the one to the right is Louis Raffles; and the one in the mid- dle is John Sharke,-with all of whom I am acquainted." Q. "How long have you known the prisoners? and what. trade did they follow?" A. "I have known Louis Raffles about seven years. He was a gold-beater, and an Englishman by birth. The other two I have known about five years. John Sharke was a locksmith, and a native of Germany. 'Elkins Holder said he was born in New Hampshire. When I first knew him, he was a cab-driver." Q. "Fere you acquainted with Charles Ringford? If so, describe him, and state where he resided, how long you have known him, and what business he followed." A. "There was a man called Dr. Charles Ringford, who-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       125 with his wife, boarded at the City Hotel when I first knew him, five years ago. He was about five feet ten inches high, of handsome features, had black eyes and dark curly hair,--was fashionably dressed, and had very agreeable manners. He appeared to b6 a gentleman born, without any regular occupation. His age was probably twenty- six." Q.--"Did you become acquainted with Mrs. Ringford? If so, describe her appearance." A.--"I saw her ofton, in the private parlor of her husband at the hotel. She had a somewhat sallow complexion, blue eyes, sandy hair, .high cheek-bones, nose inclined to turn up; and her age-seemed to be thirty-five or forty. She was finely dressed, and somewhat precise in her manners." Q.--"Did you ever see the prisoners in her company? If so, state at what time and for what purpose they were introduced to her." A.--"To answer this question fully, I shall be compelled to go back to the beginning of the acquaintance which the prisoners and myself formed with Dr. Ringford. Between four and five years ago, the exact time I cannot remember, we first saw Dr. Ringford at a billiard-saloon on Broadway, near Canal. The prisoners and myself had been several months in the habit of visiting gaming-saloons and other public resorts, to amuse ourselves at night, and to make something when the opportunity permitted. Noticing Dr. Ringford as a high-strung, flashy cltracter, who seemed to have a good deal of money, we consulted among ourselves how to approach him with the hope of profit. Finally it was agreed that Louis Raffles, who was glib of tongue and had a fashionable air, should by mere accident invite him to join in a game of billiards. To this he consented. After playing a game or, two, Raffles ordered glasses for all, in which the doctor participated. We got into friendly con- versation with him, and expressed a desire. that he would take another game with us the next evepnig. This ho 1m  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7248-00000064"/> 126       WILKINS WYDER; OR, promised to do. We met some half-dozen times at the billiard-saloon. After he began to feel easy with us, we visited other places together, and went to Pat Hearn's. This establishment, large and elegantly furnished, and con- ducted with much decorum, with cigars, wines, and lunch all free, took the fancy of Dr. Ringford, who looked intenly on the game, and saw large piles of gold on the table al- ternately won by the faro-bank and paid to fortunate bet- ters. Raffles laid down a few checks, and winked at the dealer. The checks won, and in a very short time they increased to five hundred dollars, when he drew the money in gold, and turned to Dr. Ringford and the rest of our company to follow him. We then went to the Howard House, where Raffles ordered a champagne supper for five. While at table, Dr. Ringford took glass for glass with us in drinking the healths of each other. He gave us to un- derstand that he was happy to form our acquaintance. Raffles, our spokesman, expressed our satisfaction in falling in with him, and hoped to see him again at Hearn's, or any other place most agreeable to him. He said he would take a game of billiards with us the next evening, after which he should claim the privilege of returning our liberality." Here Mr. Norris, counsel for the prisoners, objected to this long preface, on the part of the witness, as irrelevant, alleging that these visits lto Hearn's, and late suppers at the Howard House, had nothing to do with the issue. He therefore begged the court to require the witness to come at once to the facts, without fatiguing the jury by a windy narrative that had no application to the case. The attorney-general was of opinion that the witness was keeping within the rule. A conspiracy was charged, and it was proper to have all the preliminary facts to show the criminal intentions of the prisoners. Judge Vanderpool decided that the case was of such a nature as to justify this latitude in the testimony. He saw ,    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      127 no departure of the witness from the issue, and he should allow him to proceed. Q.-' After this supper, where was the next interview the prisoners had with Dr. Ringford?" A.-"At the billiard-saloon the next evening, by his ap- pointment. After playing several games, Dr. Ringford in- vited the prisoners and myself to take a champagne supper with him at the City Hotel. Mr. Wilbraham, the pro- prietor, showed us the dining-room, and remained only a few minutes, to see that every thing was in order. It was quite a splendidentertainment. We did not see Mrs. Ring- ford that evening, as she had probably retired to rest before we came into the Private parlor. By agreement we met Dr. Ringford at Hearn's the next evening. We all sat an hour, tasting wines and lunch, and smoking cigars, during which time the prisoners told Dr. Ringford what business they followed. Raffles said he was chief-clerk in the Bank of the Metropolis, at a salary of four thousand dollars; but often found that the faro-bank paid the best, besides being a pleasant relaxation to his mind. Sharke repre- sented himself as a broker on Wall Street, having large transactions in stocks, by which he sometimes made ten or twenty thousand dollars at a pass. His main income, how- ever, was in buying and selling for others, for which he received a commission. Holder professed to be an auction- eer on William Street, and he often bad to close out large invoices of goods worth from thirty to one hundred thou- sand dollars. He had several clerks, who attended to the details, while he enjoyed the profits. I claimed to be a jobber in the grocery trade, on Front Street, dealing ex- tensively in foreign wines and brandies, which I had made very profitable by improving the flavor through a secret of my own. "Raffles then, in a careless manner, inquired of Sharke, Holder, and myself if we were prepared to contribute our fifty thousand dollars each, to form, with him, a cash capital  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7248-00000065"/> -128      WILKINS WYDER; OR, of two hundred thousand dollars to be invested in water- lots, the value of which was increasing fifty per cent. every year. For his part, Raffles said, a few more nights at Hearn's would enable him to plank up his share. Sharke mentioned that he had control' of stocks and money from which he could at any time pay in his share. Holder con- fessed himself to be a little hard pushed just then. He had lately sold out an invoice of French goods for cash, but had taken the word of the purchaser to pay at thirty days, or sooner if the consignor demanded a settlement. His correspondent had arrived from France sooner than he ex- pected, and ,called for the money. Holder had to check for the whole amount, as the purchaser was absent from the city and had left no directions about closing the bill in his absence. In a few weeks, however, Holder would be in funds to fork up. I then had to state my financial prospects, which were very bright for the purpose. I hinted at a clear gain of twenty thousand dollars I had made within the last ten days, in buying empty casks with the foreign and inspection brands upon them, and filling them with my own. mixtures, which cost me sixty cents per gallon, and my sales were from three to five dollars per gallon. This margin was not better than was realized by other dealers on the same principle, as I informed Dr. Ringford, who manifested a little surprise at my confession. "These notes having been compared, Raffles wished to increase the joint capital to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,-as a quarter of a million would sound more in the Astor line, and give greater strength as well as larger profits to the company. Sharke said the same thought had occurred to him, and he knew precisely where 4e fifth partner could be had. A bank-director, who was a parti- cular friend of his, had lately signified a desire to invest fifty thousand dollars, and asked him to look out for a good opportunity. Holder remarked that bank-directors could be of great service to any concerx in which they K   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      129 were interested; but for himself he had rather have his good friend Dr. Ringford as the fifth shareholder, if he liked the operation. There was plenty of money in it,--perhaps millions of dollars; enough to make them all rich. They had become acquainted; and, from what he could see of the doctor during the short time they had been together, he would make a firstrate business man, after fishing up a few bags of gold and getting his spirit in tune. "Dr. Ringford said that he would consider the offer, and the means he could possibly raise to take a share. His wife had a rice-plantation and a hundred slaves in the South, also bank-stock, and a few thousands on deposite,- all perhaps worth between eighty and a hundred thousand dollars. He did not like to sell this property without giving her a good reason. In fact, he could make no title to the real estate unless she joined in the deed. Such was the law. He thought if Mrs. Ringford could be assured of a profitable investment she would consent to a sale of the property, and that the proceeds should be used in trade or converted into public securities of some kind. Raffles said nothing was easier than to satisfy her on that point. A commercial partnership could be formed, or, what per- haps was better, an interest could be taken in an old es- tablished house to give Mrs. Ringford the relief her mind wanted. For instance, there was a firm whose account was kept in the Bank of the Metropolis, amounting to a million of deposites annually,-Messrs. Clawson, Wolfe&amp; Co. The senior partner was newly married, being old and rich; Mr. Wolfe was a bachelor; and the dormant partner, Mr. Otto Kungle, a German banker, had very little to do with the business. It would be easy to have the arrangements made; and that evening he would call upon the house to know if a new partner would be admitted, and upon what terms. Here the parties separated until the next morning, when Raffles told Dr. Ringford, in presence of the other two prisoners and myself, that the house had cheerfully I  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7248-00000066"/> 180       WILKINS WYDER; OR, agreed to receive him as a partner. Raffles produced a printed card of the new firm, Clawson, Ringford, Wolfe &amp; Co., Dealers in Silks, -Laces, &amp;c., 308 Pearl Street, New York, which he handed to each of us, and a number to Dr. Ring- ford for circulation among his friends at the South. {'Raffles proposed that we should pay our respects to Mrs. Ringford, and inform her of the splendid investment in lots, and also of the high commercial position of her husband, which the card would announce. She would learn that all this would be accomplished by a capital of fifty or sixty thousand dollars from Dr. Ringford, which in a few years would realize more than a million in profits. Dr. Ringford approved the suggestion, and invited us to his private parlor at the City Hotel after tea. We called, and after passing some time in compliments and flying news to entertain Mrs. Ringford, Raffles casually drew our atten- tion to the sudden rise of city lots, and the fortunes that were daily made -by speculators in that kind of property. He told us "of one instance, that of Mr. Rathbone, who pur- chased two hundred thousand dollars' worth of lots, paying one-half cash, and giving his notes for the. other half at ninety days, and before his paper matured he sold a half- interest for three hundred thousand dollars in cash. This came within the knowledge of Raffles, who saw the money counted on 4eposite. Then there was such a demand for foreign goods that he had no doubt the large importing house of Clawson, Wolfe &amp; Co. would makje a half-million clear profit that season; and he congratulated Mrs. Ringford on the prospect she had of soon seeing her husband -rank as one of the merchant princes of the city, worth over a million of dollars, which would give her such great influ- ence in society, and all the pleasures which Saratoga, New- port, Nahant, and other watering-places could afford inthe summer, with a voyage to Europe when -she pleased, as her husband would frequently have to go there to purchase his stocks for the trade. "\.                . i   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      , 131 "IMrs. Ringford paid close attention to Raffles, and then remarked that if Dr. Ringford thought proper to engage in trade, and could associate himself with some good house, she would be willing to see him turn his property at the South into cash, which would probably amount to eighty or one hundred thousand dollars. Raffles assured her that the partnership was already forned, and handed her one of the cards of Clawson, Ringford, Wolfe &amp; Co. During all this time, Sharke and Holder were present, dropping in a few words occasionally to strengthen what Raffles said about the increase of values, speculations in real estate, stocks at the Exchange, the rise in foreign goods, &amp;c., and the certainty that Dr. Ringford would soon become a mil- lionnaire. " About a month thereafter, Raffles told Sharke, Htolder, and myself that Dr. Ringford had sold hiss wife's property Sbuth, and had bank-checks on New York for fifty thousand dollars, and that so soon as a fifth undivided interest in the water-lots was conveyed to him, Dr. Ringford was ready to pay the cash for his share. Raffles then went to a job- office, and had a deed printed on parchment, with enticing ornaments on the border, and a representation annexed, showing squares, lots, and streets, regularly numbered, all styled 'IMPERIAL WATER-LOT COMPANY.' The lots ranged from one to six hundred, each forty feet east and extend- ing one hundred and fifty feet west, containing six thou- sand square feet. The blanks in the deed were filled, conveying all these lots, and the 'appurtenances thereto belonging,' to the prisoners and myself, in consideration of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, signed 'Ralph Wicklow, President,' and '-Leo. Carter, Secretary.' Raffles then had a deed drawn in beautiful style, also on parch- ment, by a regular conveyancer, ready for signature by the prisoners and myself when Dr. Ringford should pay the money. We met him in a notary's office, showed him our title, which the notary pronounced to be in due form  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7248-00000067"/> 132       WILKINS WYDER, OR} and then told him that he was ready to convey an undi- vided interest of one-fifth in the -whole six hundred lots. He handed to Raffles ten checks of five thousand dollars each, on different banks in the cityS, making fifty thou- sand in all,-the price agreed upon. The deed was then signed by the prisoners and myself, attested by the notary, and delivered toDr. Ringford. We congratulated him on his good luck, and closed the interview in a bar-room, by a touch of glasses to each other's health. This is the sub- stance of the transactions between Dr. Ringford and the prisoners, so far as I have any knowledge." Question by the Attorney- General.-'"Were the lots real, or imaginary? Was there, in good faith, such a company as that represented in the deed signed 'Ralph Wicklow, President'? Did the prisoners pay any thing for' said pretended lots?" Answer.-"Thprisoners and myself had combined to- gether to obtain money under false pretences; and the larger the scale the better. This was, in fact, our real employment, having forsaken our honest trades. The whole water-lot affair was a story gotten up expressly to deceive Dr. Ringford, as we saw that he was a green subject. Raffles was the leading character, and suggested the several plans; but the other prisoners and myself con- curred and helped to carry them out. There was no such water-lot company in my knowledge, nor did the pri- soners pay a cent for the title they produced, except a few ! dollars to the printer and the draftsman. It was all a fabrication, by which we gained fifty thousand dollars,- the checks all having been paid on presentation at the banks. Sharke, Holder, and myself received ten thousand dollars each, and Raffles twenty thousand.' Q.--"Did Dr. Ringford, after his purchase, ask you, or any of the prisoners, to show him the lots?" A.-"We dropped his acquaintance when we closed the trade, and never sought his company afterward. In about   TEHE SUCCESSFUL MAN.   4   133 a fortnight he accosted me, and asked to be shown the lots. I told him I would do so in a day or two. I began to feel uneasy lest he might negotiate with Constable Hays about the lots, and mentioned the subject to the prisoners. To render him easy, Raffles proposed that we should pay Dr. Ringford one thousand dollars, which we did, and represented to him that it was his shae of the profits on two lots which had been sold since he was taken into partnership. That was the only dividend with Dr. Ringford, and the last and only return he had for his fifty thousand dollars." Q.-"What steps were taken by the house of Clawson, Ringford, Wolfe and Co. to enlarge its business, or what became of that firm?" A.-- it originated in the prolific brain of Louis Raffles, and nrever had an existence outside of his fancy. There was no such concern. The card was printed to deceive Mrs. Ringford, and her husband connived at the use of it. He never troubled me, or either of the prisoners, about the affairs of that house, so far as I kenow. Having put no capital in, he had no desire to face his partners. The card was never circulated beyond the vision of Mrs. Ringford. Having exhausted itself in obtaining .her consent to the sale of the property, it went no further." Q.-- Do you know what became of Dr. Ringford, and what was his employment after the water-lot purchase and before he went away from his wife?" A.--"I think he lived freely at the hotel, and gambled at a bold rate on the twenty or thirty thousand dollars he had left after paying for his water-lots. At least I saw him occasionally for a year or two, maintaining a style which must have cost him from five to ten thousand dol- lars a year. His' wife appeared to enjoy the expense, as she had been assured by Raffles that her husband was soon to be a millionnaire. If Raffles ever informed her differently, I was not present. So far as I could judge, 12 i   .      .  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7248-00000068"/> 134       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Dr. Ringford allowed the impression to remain to the last, on the mind of his wife, that be was an importing mer- chant and making large profits. He represented to her that it was his duty to visit Europe to buy a fresh stock of goods for his house. Instead of sailing in the packet- ship 'Garrick,' as he pretended on taking leave of her, he shipped on the brig 'Empresario' for New Orleans, and, from latest accounts, he is still there, at the head of a gambling establishment, of which the wealthy Madame Caldwell is partner." Q.--"By what names did the prisoners and yourself pass when you were in the company of Mrs. Ringford?" A.--"Raffles was called Bailey, Sharke went by the name of Robbins, Holder answered to Jarmip, and I passed as Dixon." Here the Attorney-General informed the court that he should rest the prosecution on the evidence submitted, unless it became necessary to rebut. Mr. Norris opened the case for the defence, and claimed a verdict of acquittal from the jury, on the ground that the only witness was a man who, by his own confession under oath, was as guilty as the prisoners, took part in the conspiracy from beginning to end, and shared largely in the profits of the swindle. Mr. Norris submitted to the court whether it was not clearly his right to press this consideration upon the jury, and whether the law did not regard informers with distrust. Judge:Vanderpool remarked that the question was one of credibility, for the, jury alone to consider. If the pro- secution had any corroborating proof, the ends of justice required that :it should be introduced, and he would allow it to be done. The Attorney-General said, that he had another witness, whom, from motives of delicacy which all must appreciate, he was unwilling to bring into court unless it was essential in the last resort. Seeing the advantage of which the   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       135 defence availed itself, he would put a witness on'the stand who did 'not know a word of the testimony of the first witness, nor was there any possibility of her being informed of it by other persons. He requested the sheriff tothring Mrs. Ringford into court. Here the large crowd of spectators became excited by curiosity to see the fair witness, who soon made her appearance, leaning on the arm of her nephew, Wilkins Wylder, Esq. Her face was covered by a black lace veil, which she drew aside in taking the oath. She was then seated in the witness-box, and the examination proceeded. Question by the Attorney-General.--"What is your name, madam, your age, and place of residence?" Answer.-"My name was originally Mary Guyon, before marriage': it is now Mary Guyon Ringford. As to my age, my information is altogether hearsay, which I un- derstand is not received in- courts of justice. I am a native of the South, but for the last- six years have resided in this city." Q.--"Look around you, madam, and see if you recognise any faces which you have seen before." A.-"I se'e near me an individual who was called Dixon in my presence (pointing to the witness who had just been examined). In the prisoners' box are three others who were in company. The man on the right was called Bailey (pointing to Raffles), the one in the middle was called Robbins (pointing to Sharke), and the person on the left was called Jarmin (pointing to Holder)." The witness was then asked to state what represena- tions the prisoners made to her concerning the business relations or prospects of 6er husband, to induce her to consent to the sale of her property in the South to be invested in New York.' Mrs. Ringford, in a deliberate manner, then proceeded to state facts at considerable length, touching the conduct of the prisoners, substantially as detailed by the witness, k-  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7248-00000069"/> 136       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Jasper Slinke. The agreement was singular. It impressed every one who heard them with the consistency and good faith of the two statements. All- cross-examination was declined by the defence, which seemed to be paralyzed. The judge inquired of the sheriff if he had done his duty in preventing Mrs. Ringford from knowing the testimony of the witness Slinke. The sheriff replied that she had been -locked up in his room, ia bailiff posted at the door, and no person was permitted to convey a word or sign to her during the time the witness, Slinke, was delivering his testimony; that at the close of it, when Mrs. Ringford was called for, she came from the room and took the arm of Mr. Wylder, who immediately conducted her to the witness-box, without speaking a word.         ; No further evidence was introduced on either side. Mr. Norris then moved the court for an acquittal of the pri- soners, on the ground that no conspiracy had been proved to defraud Mrs. Ringford, as alleged in the indictment. By her marriage, all the property of that lady passed to her husband in absolute right, and he was authorized to do with it as he pleased. The indictment did not charge a conspiracy to defraud Charles Ringford, because it would have been dangerous so to allege, as the evidence, if believed at all, clearly showed that he was as much a conspirator as the prisoners; and sifrely no man could be punished for defrauding himself. The legal conclusion was that Mrs. Ringford, not having the title, possessed no rights which could be made the foundation of conspiracy and fraud. The proof, therefore, had wholly failed, and there was no necessity of arguing it before the jury. Mr. Van Hooten, who assisted the Attorney-General, denied the force of the objection which had been raised. In regard to the real estate, which was a plantation large enough ton employ one hundred slaves in the culture of rice, there could be no dispute whatever as to Mrs. Ring-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       137 ford'sy ested rights. Her husband was forbidden by law from selling this real estate, as lie could make no title what- ever unless his wife joined in the deed of conveyance. She was induced to do this by the false representations of the prisoners, as she declared in her evidence. As to the per- sonal property, slaves, bank-stock, and cash deposites, which Dr. Ringford acquired by his marriage, his wife had an equitable interest which she was at liberty to assert whenever she perceived occasion. -For instance, had she suspected that her husband was wasting the property and waslikely to impoverish her, she could have filed her bill in chancery claiming an adequate support from it, and the provision would have been decreed. But the prisoners artfully led her to believe that her husband was soon to become worth a million of dollars; and she therefore let the opportunity slip to secure the maintenance to which she was entitled out of the property she brought her hus- band on marriage. The swindle was complete, and the exception taken by the learned advocate (Mr. Norris) to the sufficiency of the evidence was whollyv invalid, and could not be sustained in law. The court overruled the objection urged by Mr. Norris, and decided that Mrs. Ringford had an interest in the property capable of being made the subject of fraud to her damage, independent of the marital rights of her husband. It was agreed by the counsel on each side to submit the case to the jury without argument, under the charge of the court. His honor then instructed the jury upon the law of the case. It was for them to decide upon the weight of evi- dence. It was true, as contended by the counsel for the prisoners, that where one of the guilty parties is sworn as a witness against his confederates in crime, his' credi- bility is to be judged as the circumstances may incline. But wherever there is corroborating proof, and the jury 12.-  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7248-00000070"/> 138       WILKINS WYDER; OR, shall be satisfied that his statement is true, his unfavorable position does not of itself render him unworthy of belief. The jury had heard what the last witness said, and the wonderful agreejment in particulars, here collusion between the two witnesses was impossible. /The case was very pe- culiar in many of its features. There had been an inge- .nuity and perseverance on the part of the prisoners to defraud Dr. Ringford and his wife on a large scale, beyond any example within the knowledge of the court. It was for the jury to find the -issue, guilty or not guilty, as the proof might influence their judgment. The jury retired, and in fifteen minutes returned a ver- dict of "Guilty" against all the prisoners. They were sen- tenced by the court to imprisonment and hard labor in the penitentiary for the term of ten years, and were then re- manded to their cells in thd Tombs to await the official escort to Sing-Sing. CHAPTER XIX. THE next morning after the trial, the whole proceedings in the case were reported in the "New York Forum," with the following editorial comment:- "The People vs. Louis Raffles, John Sharke, and Elkins Holder, indicted for conspiracy and swindling:-verdict, Guilty. "Yesterday, Judge Vanderpool sentenced the prisoners to ten years' hard labor in the State Prison at Sing-Sing, for having perpetrated one of the most extensive and au- dacious acts of swindling known in the records of crime. We refer our readers to the evidence given in court, which will be found in our columns to-day. The prisoners were   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       139 all fashionably dressed at the trial; and no doubt they belong to a large class in our city who, under the garb of gentlemen, are daily engaged in. schemes to plunder those unfortunate individuals who confide too much in appear- ances. We are shocked'by the disclosures in the case. The success which attended the conspiracy has at length failed the guilty parties. A gentleman of high public and social position at the South, a relative of the lady whose large fortune was, swept from her by these convictedhar- pies, attended to the prosecution. He has deported himself throughout in a firm and dignified manner, well suited to judicial investigation; and he returns to his distant home fully assured that, though there may be villains in boots and broadcloth, there is also present, as a pervading ele-  ment, the majesty of the law to punish all offenders. High- Constable Hays exercised his usual vigilance in following up the sinuosities of the case, to the ultimate vindication of our criminal justice." The case off his hands, Mr. Wylder at once prepared to leave for the South. In the mean time, he was called' on at the hotel by a gentleman who had seen him in the court- room, and recollected his appearance several years before at Hillburg. While travelling in the South to extend the sales of lMessrs. Goode, Hanks &amp; Co., law-book publishers, Mr. Gerald Morton had been introduced to Mr. Wylder by Cecil Warner, Esq., a prominent attorney of the village. Mr. Morton expressed his satisfaction at meeting Mr Wylder in New York, where so much was to be seen in commerce, manufactures, and the arts, worthy of being remembered, and that he would be happy to act as his guide. The offer was kindly accepted, and the two gentlemen set off on their expedition to the shipping, to the machine-foundries, galleries of paintings, public institutions, and other places which Mr. Wylder had not'previously visited. Mr. Wells had remained in the city to witness the termina-  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7248-00000071"/> "O       WLKsINS WiYDER; OR, tion of the trial. At its conclusion, he notified his former pupil that the next day he should embark for Europe. They both called on- Mrs. Ringford at her/ boarding-house, where they passed the evening quite pleasantly in conversation Mr. Wells told Mrs. Ringford that her nephew would 'be detained a few days longer in the city, on suspicion of being a great man; for it was not until the allusion was made in the newspaper, afterthe trial, to "a gentleman of high public and social position in the South," that it was ascertained by the Graball party who that distinguished character was; when, lo! he proved to be the veritable author of the cele- brated resolutions amplifying the creed of his party, and illustrating its practice, in thirteen phases, to signify the original States of the Union as the basis of our Govern- ment. There was a charm in this conception which had fascinated the Wigwam of St. Andrew's; and a tender of civilities would be the consequence. Mr. Wylder laughed heartily at this airy flight of his old tutor. As it would be the last joke he would probably indulge in at his expense before their separation, he would take it in all kindness; but, as to any intended honor, he suspected that his friend was only dreaming over again the fond visions of Wy lder Hall, which he desired should come to pass. Next morning a gentleman called at- Lovejoy's and in- quired for. Mr. Wylder, as he wished to deliver to him per- sonally a note of importance. Mr. Wylder was notified, and he came down from his room to receive the messenger, who handed him the following:-- "ST. ANDREW'S HALL, March 3, 18-. "SIR:--The Society of St. Andrew's, having just been in- formed of your visit to the city, and being desirous of mani- festing their respectful -sentiments, beg that you will honor their meeting to-morrow night with your presence. It is proper to say that the resolutions offered in your State Legislature, affirming the principles of the Graball party,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       141 and your speech in their support, have impressed the Society with a high opinion of your political orthodoxy, and your qualifications for public usefulness. And espe- cially do they value that high order of courage and saga- city which prompted you to renovate the creed of a party which, by casual errors of long indulgence, had fallen into a decline threatening its dissolution. With your trumpet- voice you warned them of the impending danger, and by the energy of your will and the- stern declarations of an honest purpose, you snatched the glorious remnant from the tomb of the Capulets, tp bloom and luxuriate in the gardens of beauty; or, in other words, the Graball party had ceased to command the homage of many, until by your purifying wand you restored it to its ancient glory. "It is a source of gratulation to the Society,' that the flag of the Graball party waves in triumph over all sections of the country, North and South, East and West; and it is the earnest aim of the Society to humble all factions at the footstool of Graball ascendency, and to establish one vast empire of Liberty, presided over by the American Eagle. You will confer a signal favor on the Society by complying with this invitation, thereby affording its members the pleasing opportunity of forming your acquaintance, and testifying the high regard in which they hold your cha- racter. I have the honor to be, sir, Your obedient servant, "HON. UW. WYDER."  , WILL. WHARTON, Secretary." This communication was most gratifying to Mr. Wylder, as it made him feel that he was in the midst of political friends, who had done his motives justice in advance of hid arrival. He immediately dispatched a reply:--        ( LOVEJOY'S HOTEL, March 4, 18-. "SIR: -Your note of the 3d inst. does me unmerited honor.

Indeed, were I present, I fear I should not be able to meet your expectations by a speech, As my feelings are not in a frame to unite in any public2 demonstration. "As you doubtless know, my visit to the 'city has been occasioned by the misfortunes of a dear relative, which have been made the subject of judicial proceedings. That business completed, I have no inducement to remain, except to accompany on shipboard, and embrace for the last time, the honored tutor of my boyhood, Mr. Theodore Wells, who is now returning to his native Europ*. That duty I expect to perform in a few hours, and to bid my best friend (after my parents) an affectionate farewell. The youthful enthusiasm of Mr. Wells in the cause of letters and of refined moral progress was mainly inspired by the conversations which it was his privilege to hold with Goethe, the celebrated German poet. From my tenth to my eighteenth year, Mr. Wells had the sole charge of my education at Wylder Hall; he was at all times my friend and travelling companion; and if I have any qualities of learning or of virtue to deserve the favor of my country- men, I am indebted to that worthy gentleman for their faithful direction, Knowing that your Society is the patron of merit, whether native or foreign, I have consi- dered this a proper occasion to bear my testimony in behalf of the accomplished scholar to whom I stand in this pleasing relation. "You have kindly alluded to my resolutions and speech, which, I perceive, have obtained notoriety even out of my own State. I am gratified at the approving tone of your remarks, as I am persuaded you but express the opinions of the Society, whose organ you are, to communicate with me on the present occasion.

This testimonial will encourage me to exert myself still further in behalf of that proud pillar of the Constitution without whose support it would fall prostrate in the dust. "Before the hour of your assembling, I expect to be in the steamer, accompanied by the honorable though injured relative to redress whose wrongs I came to your great city. Your efficient police enabled me to trace and punish a fraud whose parallel has rarely been seen in the records of crime. Having accomplished my object to the full /[;i; I4 measure of penal retribution, I can speak well of the dig- nified magistrates who administer your laws. "Returning my sincere thanks to the Society for the  compliment of the invitation you so politely conveyed to me, I have the honor to remain your very obedient servant, W. WYDER." The Secretary of the St. Andrew's Society showed this correspondence to the President, Hon. Wallace Hadley, who sent it forthwith to the "Evening Post." In the mean time Mr. Wylder had gone with Mr. Wells on board the Liverpool packet "Westminster," as the ship was to leave her wharf, near the Fulton Ferry, at four o'clock PM.  i Just before the order was given by Captain Parsons to  haul in the plank, the newsboys came on board, from each of whom Mr. Wylder bought two copies of the evening papers; which he divided with Mr. Wells, to read on the voyage. The two friends then embraced silently, for their emotions denied them words, and they parted forever. Mr. Wylder forthwith entered a hack, and drove rapidly. to Fourth Street for Mrs. Ringford, who was ready, aid instantly took her seat. Returning by Lovejoy's, Mr. Wylder settled his bill and received his baggage. In' a few minutes the hack delivered its passengers at Peck Slip, as the bell rang, and soon the steamer "South Carolina," Cap.

Up to this time Mr. Wylder had been too busy to look into an evening's paper; but now he opened his package, and the first paper he read was the "Post," in which he saw the correspondence between him- self and the Secretary of St. Andrew's.- He was quite gratified to know that he had given a copy to Mr. Wells, who would carry back with him to Europe so flattering a testimonial in which their names were associated. CHA PTER XX. MRS. RINGFORD was once more at Wylder Hall. Her reception by all the inmates was particularly cordial. Not a word, not even a cold glance, reminded her of the un- happy past. The room she formerly occupied was again at her disposal,-every thing, indeed) to make her situation agreeable. Her sister related all the occurrences which had taken place in the neighborhood during her absence,- told her of the little girls who had grown large enough to be sent' to boarding-schools, and of the lads who were at college. There had been several deaths among their relatives and choice friends to deplore, including a few recently-married lalies with Whom they were intimate. Sundry young men who had just completed their educa- tion when Mrs. Ringford left Wylder Hall six years before had gone into different professions, and most of them had fair prospects. Only one of the number had abandoned himself to a dissolute life. His talents were universally praised, and he was led to think too highly of himself:. consequently he fell into a snare, became intemperate, grieved his parents, and yielded to a fate as abject as   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       145 his genius and pride had been lofty. Such was poor Aure- lins Tompkins. The marriage of her daughter, Angelina, was mentioned by Mrs. Wylder in terms of satisfaction. She described her son-in-law as a young man of excellent qualities and of high position, not omitting to narrate the narrow escape Wilkins had made from the snares of a beautiful young widow with whom he had become acquainted on the bridal visit to Hampton. These, and other harmless items of gossip, were cal- culated to divert the mind of Mrs. Ringford from the contemplation of her own sorrow. Dr. Wylder was very kind in his deportment toward her, always giving her some little token of his esteem. Wilkins frequently took her out to ride, either on horseback or in a carriage, as she might prefer. While in New York, ste had'purchased a fine riding-suit, with cap and feathers, which she had worn on a few occasions when, accompanied by her dashing husband, she had trotted a fine charger on the Blooming- dale Road. She put on this dress at Wylder Hall, when about to take the saddle; and her appearance was quite romantic, exciting remarks in the vicinity through which she made her equestrian excursions. The people who indulged their criticism. styled her the fashionable grass widow, who, though poor as any of them, still kept up proud airs. But these remarks, however injudicious, never disturbed the object of them. She had seen too much of life on a grand scale to care for the malicious whisperings of the ignorant. In truth, she was compelled to keep up all the forms of wealth and fashion in order to maintain serenity of spirit. tHad she yielded to her altered con- dltion, it would have been an acknowledgment degrading to her taste. Mrs. Ringford knew the elevated principles of her family, and the generous heart of Dr. Wylder, too well, to calculate on their favor by sinking herself into obscurity, Noble sentiments, and nobly justified.

Ezra Holton, who still maintained his pastoral relations to the family. He took occasion to condole with Mrs.' Ringford on her reverses, and to administer spiritual relief, expressing the hope, that she would receive all this chastening for good,. as it was no doubt intended as such by the mercy of Heaven. Mrs. Ringford heard the admonition respectfully, and signified her desire to treat religion and its ministers with due reverence at all times; but as to any formal change in her conduct at this period, by which the world might see her humiliation, she begged to decline the idea. With such a badge of sorrow for the public to gaze at wherever she was seen, she could not preserve her own self-respect. It was necessary that she should maintain her usual bearing in society, in order to secure its esteem, or rather to disarm its malignity. Natural history informs us that a wounded dolphin is chased to death by its fel- lows. So man or woman in trouble, especially in matters of fortune, is pursued by all the giddy crowd of spectators, until a broken heart, or death, is the result of this voluntary- persecution. To defy such injustice, she was resolved to act in the same manner as if she had not passed through- the fiery ordeal to which her own indiscretion had sub- jected her within the last few years. She thanked Mr. Holton for his kind intentions, but, with her present views of propriety, she could not yield to them. Mr. Holton admitted the seenming force of her reasons, and said they were such as he had often heard on similar occasions. He sympathized with them, and knew the honorable motives which actuated many persons in de- clining all the consolations of the gospel until they could work out their own deliverance by an arm of flesh. This determination on the part of Mrs. Ringford he much re- gretted. He knew that she had been instructed from her childhood by religious teachers, but she had from time to   *                   .

"He did not allude to'her recent sorrows for the purpose of reviving them, but to express his conviction that the present was the most auspicious time to begin the new life. She had seen the emptiness of the world in its grand circles of wealth and fashion, had experienced its duplicity, and knew the hol- lowness of its friendship. The newspapers of the day were filled with the details pf a wicked conspiracy to rob her of a large property, which had proved too successful. The felons were now expiating their crime in the State- prison; and ten, years must elapse before they could enjoy personal freedom. These, surely, were thoughts which should humble our pride and bring us to Him who never refused the prayer of the penitent. It would be a lovely scene in the household to witness one so stricken in her experience, and so beloved, take on new vows, and become the patron of the needy, the friend of the poor, and the associate of Christ's disciples, who would be happy to receive her into their communion and shield her by their prayers and offices ofi love. Here Mrs. Ringford applied her handkerchief to her eyes, and trembled as if under strong emotion. Mr. Holton 'turned aside his face to wipe away the tears that trickled down his cheeks, until he saw his companion a little re- stored to tranquillity. He then remarked, in a tender, broken voice, that he hoped she would seriously weigh his advice; that the first step necessary for her to take was to petition her heavenly Father for help, that she might know her duty and be able to perform it. If at any time she desired to converse with him further on the subject, he would attend her with very great pleasure, and give her all the aid in his power to come out on the Lord's side. He then rose from his chair, as if to leave the room', when' Mrs:Ringford requested him  to be reseated. While she evidently strove to subdue her feelings, she was still so *(   .   &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7248-00000075"/> "8       WILKINS WYDER; OR, much affected that she could scarcely find utterance. She at length informed Mr. Holton that she was afraid to trust herself for another interview to grow better, to decide correctly, and that, since the conversation Vegan, she had made up her mipd to join the church, and to cast her lot wTith those whovere seeking a happier world. Mr. Holton took her affectionately by the hand, as he bade her farewell, and said that if she would attend ser- vice on the next Sabbath, and offer herself for membership, he would rejoice to enrol her name on the books of the church, and to extend to her the right hand of fellowship. She promised to attend.  When the Sabbath arrived, Mrs. Ringford clothed herself neatly, without any excess of ornament, and accompanied the family to church. She had not disclosed her purpose to any one, except to the pastor. When the sermon was over, Mr. Holton opened the doors of the church for the reception of members, when Mrs lRingford came forward and gave him her hand. The congregation were taken by surprise. Many of them shed tears. Mrs. Wylder was overcome by her feelings, and wept aloud. As her sister returned to the pew, they embraced each other. The effect was general. More than a hundred persons who looked on wept freely. The minister sobbed audibly, but at length composed himself so as to repeat a hymn to the choir, and, after the beautiful singing was over, the bene- diction "was pronounced. It was a day long to be remem- bered, when the once proud but now penitent Mary Guyon humbled herself as a little child at the feet of her Saviour. Wilkins had informed his parents of his meeting with Mr. Wellb in New York, of the latter's friendly recollec- tions of Wylder Hall, and of their parting on shipboard the evening he left the city. He thanked his father for having selected such an instructor, one of the most supe- 6 rior. men he had ever seen.    - A running account was then given of the conspiracy in   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       149 Newtork, the substance of which had been published in the newspapers his father had seen. Wilkins expressed the opinion that his aunt had demeaned herself, under the trying circumstances, with a propriety and firmness which could not fail to endear her more closely to her friends. V Dr. Wylder was gratified to learn so much in favor of his sister-in-law, and determined within himself to forget, as be had long forgiven, her unhappy elopement. Wilkins still continued to make Wylder Hall his home, though his father had offered him a settlement whenever ho thought proper to accept it. He -often went into the society of his neighbors, and made himself agreeable to old and young. They were proud of his increasing repu- tation, and especially admired his course in New York in bringing the robbers of his aunt to justice. They looked upon him as a man of note, to whom all things were pos- sible which could be accomplished by talents, learning, and perseverance. In one of his visits to the seat of govern- ment, during the recess of the Legislature, to renew his acquaintance with the citizens and to have a friendly word or two with the Secretary of State,.who was much his friend, and to consult him probably onh affairs of the heart, (the Secretary being a widower in middle life,) Wilkins found himself drawn into a correspondence for which he had made no preparation. His friend the Secretary was of opinion that a certain degree of diplomatic polish and formality was essential to captivate ladies of great refine- ment; and as he had lately seen one of that description, whose image gave him no rest day or night, he made him his confidant, and begged the assistance of his pen to in- troduce himself to her. As related by the Secretary, the facts were these. One day a carriage' drove to the Capitol Square. Two finely- dressed ladies descended, without an escort, and came into the rotunda, viewing the different parts of the edifice, ad- miring Fts architectural ornaments, wlen they were seen 13  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7248-00000076"/> 150       WILKINS WYDER; OR, by the Secretary, who advanced and made a tender of ser- vice in the politest manner. They informed him that they resided in an adjoining State; and, having a day at their disposal while passing through the city, they concluded to take a peep at the Capitol, of which they had heard so many flattering descriptions. The Secretary assured them that he would be delighted to show them the public offices, and also the Senate and Representative Chambers, paint- ings, &amp;c. He desired, in the mean time, to honor himself by inviting them into his office, where all the important public records were kept. Having walked in, the ladies were astonished at the immense quantity of large folios on the shelves from the floor to the ceiling, and asked'the object of them. The gallant Secretary spok'e of land-titles, -how that a copy of the survey and grant to every lot of land in the State, from the Revolution to the present time, was contained in those volumes, besides a copy of every commission issued, from judge of the Supreme Court to a justice of the peace, and from a major-general to an ensign, and to members of Congress, all had to be recorded, word for word. Besides these, the correspondence of the depart- ment, the proclamations of the Governor, and the reports from public officers, all had to be copied, and preserved, in this form. The'ladies signified that it must be very laborious to keep up with all these matters, and that it required a clear head to guide them correctly. Whereupon the Secretary bowed them across the passage to the Executive office, the Governor being absent. His private secretaries, however, were at work, amid the same display of folios-and executive journals, within view of a thousand pigeon-holes full of papers, all labelled. The paintings, war relics, and other objects worthy of attention were observed by the fair visitors; and after glancing at the offices of the Surveyor- General, Comptroller, and State Treasurer, the trio ascended to the Legislative Halls, which indeed were large and beau-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       151 tiful, well furnished, and adorned with costly paintings. This completed the examination, and the Secretary then attended the ladies to their carriage. They returned him many thanks for his courtesy, and nodded him a pleasant adieu. It was under these circumstances that the friend of Wilkins applied for help.  Richard Benson (for such was the name of the Secretary) was a sensible man, self-made, and of great energy of pur- pose. What he took in hand he generally accomplished. Although his literary attainments were creditable, he did not have sufficient confidence in his pen to trust it on so important a message as he wished to deliver to one of the ladies. By inquiry at the hotel, he ascertained who they were,-mother and daughter, both widows. They were nearly allied to a distinguished Revolutionary officer who had been Governor of one of the Southern States. Their family name was Singleton, and the young widow was beautiful and accomplished, rich and childless. Hier name was Clara Mason. Now, Mr. Benson purposed in his mind to court Mrs. Clara Mason; and his friend Wilkins was the very man to prepare a letter suited to the occasion. Mr. Benson would listen to no plea of incompetency. Was not Mr Wylder an established character in letters, hailed as the author of the Graball resolutions, and complimented therefor by the St. Andrew's Society of New York? Incompetency, in- deed! It would only be a sort of valve to let off a few elegant trifles in his peculiar style. A love-letter was very simple in its construction; yet it required a sort of gilding, in which Mr. Benson confessed himself to be*very deficient. Perceiving that he had to comply, or disoblige his friend, Wilkins promised to show the draft next morning. Ac- cordingly, he went to work, and reported to the Secretary as follows:-  i \ . f  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7248-00000077"/> 152       WTTRJNS WYDER; OR, "CAPrrot SQUARE, May 14, 18-. "DEAR MADAM :--My first utterance shall be an apology for obtruding myself on your attention.. When you and your mother visited the State-House of -- a few days ago, I had the honor to attend you through the public offices and legislative halls, and to point out what was curious and worthy the attention of strangers. I was then calm, proud that I was Secretary of State, and had some credit for accuracy and system in my official charac- ter. After I saw you to th9 carriage, and I hadl again seated myself at'my business table, I felt an utter incapa- city to execute what had been before very simple labors. His Excellency the Governor has notified me that he ap- prehends serious trouble from my blunders in preparing certain documents to be laid before the Legislature of an- other State. For instance, where the name of the com- missioner to run the public boundary ought to be inserted, it reads 'our trusty and well-beloved Clara Mason'-actu- ally devolving on you this legislative trust. I had to write the paper over again; and in the next draft the Governor called my attention to the irregularity of the address:- 'His Excellency Clara Mason, &amp;c.' In fact, whether I wrote to the Secretary of War about the Indians, or to the Secretary of the Treasury relative to the proceeds of the public lands, or to Major-General Scott in reference to our military code, or to the Captain-General of Cuba to obtain an authentic copy of certain orders in Council, I could re- member no other name,-had forgotten all names but Clara Mason. Strange error! I never had such confusion of memory before. I   am daily expecting to seey my corre- spondence published in the Gazette, with Clara Mason as Governor, as Major-General, as Secretary of Wair, and as a Justice of the Peace! Can you survive the notoriety I have thus given you? I cannot. There is only one chance of escape for us both; and I now proceed to unfold it.

I have filled various public em- ployments to the satisfaction of the Legislature which con- ferred them. My property is not so large as I could wish; but I am clear of debt, have a good income, and a capital not less than thirty thousand dollars. My position in so- ciety has never been impeached. It is sufficient to guard you from the disagreeable consequences to which I have referred as likely to grow out of my official errors. If the name of Clara Mason shall sound oddly to the public ear, from the erroneous connection I have given it-with mascu- line employments, I beg that you will accept my name, which will at once silence all criticism. "It only remains for me to add, after this preliminary statement,'that I am a captive at your feet, and that one forgiving smile from you would afford me more happiness than all the honors of earth, were I able to command them. May Hso far presume on your goodness as to ask; permission to wait on you in person, at an early day, that you may decide whether the method I have suggested to relieve your name from public inquisition can be enter- tained, subject to other casualties which may arise from the interview? My fate is in your hands, and, I hope, in bonds of sweet servitude, I am ever yours, R. BENSON." The draft was joyfully adopted, and the Secretary at once transcribed it in his own handwriting, and sent it to Mrs. Clara Mason, who perused the letter with mingled  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7248-00000078"/> - 154      WILKINS WYDER; OR, surprise and satisfaction. She remembered the politeness of the Secretary, and felt obliged to him for breaking through the cold usages of society to manifest his devotion to her, after so transient a glimpse of her person. She was inclined to favor his wishes, judging of his merit by the tone of his letter, which, to say the least, was a fine specimen of gallantry, indicating a genial heart and high literary cultivation. Such a prize was not often laid at the feet of a woman, and she therefore resolved to hold it in abeyance. Her reply is here given:- "MYRTLE FOREST, May 20, 18-. "SIR:--Though your signature was not that of any formal acquaintance, and gave me at first view some embarrass- ment, I am frank to say that the interest I experienced on perusing your note quite outweighed your offence in writing it. However safe and reasonable the rule which society has established for its own protection, requiring a name to be guaranteed by formal introduction before it can be re- cognised, I have thought proper to waive all formality in the present instance, and to reply to your note. "The opportunity I had of seeing you was so brief on my late visit to your Capital, that my thoughts took no other direction than merely to appreciate your civilities in gratifying our curiosity to see the public offices and the architectural beauties of the building in which you occupy official quarters. We met as strangers, and we parted as such. You seek, however, to change this relation, and to give me a proof of your regard, which indeed is handsomely conveyed by the note you did me the honor to address to me. I should do violence to my own sense of propriety, and, allow me to say,-to my prepossessions also, were I to refuse you the permission you request. At any time when it may suit your convenience, I shall be happy to see you in my' mother's drawing-room, where we can discuss such topics as may prove mutually agreeable. "With due respect,          C. MASON."   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       155 Never was man more transported by a little piece of paper than was the Hon. Richard Benson, Secretary of State, on reading this communication. He immediately ordered a-new suit at the tailor's, and looked around him for the gayest match of horses and the finest barouche that the town afforded. tHis journey to Myrtle Forest occupied his thoughts day and night. Within ten days he presented himself at Mrs. Singleton's, and inquired for Mrs. Mason. That lady soon appeared in the drawing-room, and saw what she had to expect from her pleasant-looking visitor. During the conversation, which lasted some two hours, Mr. Benson claimed a reciprocation of civilities from Mrs. Mason, and prayed that she would in turn pilot him through the vicinity of Myrtle Forest, in 'discharge of her debt to him at the Capitol. She smiled at the proposition, and said it was too well founded in justice to be declined by her.. The gallant Secretary then informed her that he would have his, carriage at the door at five o'clock that afternoon. The drive was continued until sundown, when Mrs. Mason alighted at her mother's. The Secretary remained three days in the village, about a mile from Myrtle Forest, and gave much of his time to Mrs. Clara Mason, the rich and handsome young widow, and drives were daily re- peated in new directions. What the lovers said to each other the Secretary never disclosed, except that he had pressed the lady for a definite answer, and she begged further time for reflection. In a few days after his return home, Secretary Benson received his quietus, in shape following:- "MYRTLE FOREST, June 4, 18-. "'SIn :--Since your departure, I have seriously considered the offer you made, with the chances of happiness its ac- ceptance might secure me. On no occasion has my judg- ment been more perplexed.

WILKINS WYDER; OR, your moral worth in society, together with your official rank, all of which would incline me to confide my future to your charge, there is still a vague, imperfect shadow obscuring your presence, which I cannot dismissafrom my thoughts. "The whole difficulty, as well as I can comprehend it,. may be thus stated. I possess a natural vivacity of- spirits, and certain ideas of refinement, with which your mind fully sympathizes when you take the trouble to express yourself in writing; but, like many authors who are masters of a happy style, and who have great reputation with the public, you have a diffidence in your speech and address which greatly disappoints expectation, and would, I am free to confess, be a source of chagrin and mortifica- tion to me whenever I appeared with you in the circles of fashion and learning in which it would be my privilege to introduce you. "I regret my iuability to overcome this objection, as 'you are in other respects so eligible that I should not -hesitate to share your fortunes and to make you happy in a very tender relation to the best of my power. It may be possible that you assumed this air of rusticity and absence of mind to try my discernment, with the intention of undeceiving me at anothr time, and to delight me by the exhibition of your true cnaracter, such as your style of writing denotes. If you made any such experiment, I shall certainly take no offence, but will rather be amusec at your success in- representing a rough backwoodsman who had no original ideas, and no language to make even com- monplace topics agreeable. You can atone for the artifice by a second visit, and treating my judgment with more gravity,-by -exercising your faculties in their state of cul- tivation. If you decline giving me this proof of your homage, I shall have reason to conclude that on your late visit to Myrtle Forest you made professions of interest in my behalf which you are unwilling to execute. If there   N THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      157 was any thing in my conduct which authorized you thus to trifle with my understanding and peace of mind, I would thank you to specify it. I am not conscious of any de- parture from etiquette toward you, except in receiving your ,note, and allowing my hopes to be elevated by its phrase- ology, only to be crushed afterward by a personal address which you purposely rendered uncouth for an object in- compatible with the delicacy of a well-bred and chivalrous gentleman. "Pardon these explicit observations. They are not made in a spirit of censure, but merely to represent the condition of my mind, influenced by what was no doubt intended as a harmless romance on your part. All this commentary will be withdrawn, and you shall stand ac- quitted, if you will do me the honor to call on me in your true character, such as your style of writing has established in my imagination. "With due respect,    C. MASON." After pondering the whole matter fairly in his mind, Mr. Benson resolved to waste no further time in pursuit of the young widow. She had chosen to express herself harshy; and, to conciliate her favor, he would not put himself to the trouble of acting up to the expectations raised in her mind by his letter. Devoted as he was to the sex, he would not make such a sacrifice of independence to gain the hand of any woman. His purpose in this respect was firm, apd could never be shaken. In a free country like ours, it was the right of a man to appear sprightly on paper and dull in conversation, if it suited him. He would submit to no tyranny ' that required equal success in the two spheres of life,-the ideal and the actual. The crest-fallen Secretary enclosed the correspondenco to Mr. Wylder, and attributed his failure to the uncommon pains taken by that gentleman to make the recoil de.

Of one thing the good-natured Secretary became convinced,- that it was safest for small craft to keep near the shore in stormy weather, and that no ocean was more perilous to navigate than that of matrimony and no task more difficult than to satisfy a woman's caprice. , 1  CTTA PTER -XXT. THERE was great excitement among the people in rela- tion to the banking-systerm which had been proposed, the State making itself the only stockholder. Among the foremost politicians who had assisted in this financial scheme was Leander Squelch, a man of plain education, strong common sense, and decidedly prosperous in his own private affairs. He knew the value of money, and in imi- tation of Stephen Girgd, kept a sharp eye upon every cent due him, even to the division of copper change. By this habit of economy, and uniform success in trading on land and in lending money at usurious rates, he became a rich man. As usual in such cases, -he exercised a consider- able influence by reason of his wealth. He became a can- didate, and was elected to the Legislature. Mr. Squelch belonged to the Graball majority who had controlled the destinies of the State for a long term of years. While electioneering for his seat in the Legislature, he promised' the people that if elected he would give them a larger bank-circulation; that he had a measure he intended to bring forward, against which it would be dangerous for any man to vote, and he was certain it would prevail. Not only were the people to have plenty of money, but they were to pay no more taxes. His plan would defray r   , f   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       159 the expenses of the Government, and leave a large balance ,for the support of the common schools. Mr. Squelch accordingly introduced a bill incorporating "The President and Directors of the Bank of General Relief." The capital was to consist of fifteen millions of dollars in specie, to be obtained by the sale of State-bonds bearing interest at five per cent. The president and ten directors were to be elected annually by the Legislature. They were authorized to issue three dollars in bills for one of specie on hand, and to loan out the bills on good endorsed notes for ninety days, at which time the paper might be renewed for another term of ninety days, and so on for one year, if the parties desired, on paying the forward in- terest at each reneyal, at the rate of eiglit per cent. per annum. Mr. Squelch submitted a calculation to the effect that the issues of the, bank might extend to forty-five millions of dollars from the beginning. This amount would be represented by good notes and bills of exchange falling due in ninety days from persons who had borrowed money from the bank, the interest of which at each renewal would be nine hundred thousand dollars, or three million six hundred thousand for one year.} The specie basis to support the maximum circulation would cost the State -seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars per annum, leaving an annual profit of two million eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars. It was reasonable'to believe that the demand for money in a growing and active population, with their natural resources to develop, would always be equal to-the supply: therefore the whole forty-five million would either be kept in circulation, or, if any portion re- tired, its place would be filled by new issues. Mr. Squelch gave the Legislature a very ingenious and tempting view of the subject. He referred to his own financial experience. The sums which he had under his control, though never large in comparison with what was possessed by the bank, were always rendered available.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7248-00000081"/> 160   /"   WILKINS WY-ILDER; OR, There was no such thing as dead capital on his hands. Every thing increased. The soil declared good dividends, and so did all other property, animate and inanimate. What was true in the individual case could be made equally productive in the management of the bank, under a wise and faithful board of directors. They should receive liberal salaries,-- the president three thousand, and the directors two thousand dollars each, per annum. Wlth this compensation they could afford to give their whole time to official duties, just as a schoolmaster devoted himself entirely to the service of his patrons. Every note or bill offered for discount should have unquestionable signatures; and to this eAd the certificate of a member of the Legislature, that he knew the parties to be responsible, should in all cases be produced to the board, to- gether with a certificate from the clerks of the circuit and county courts that there were no judgments unsatisfied against them in their offices. The presumption was that every man of energy and prudence, rich or poor, would seek the accommodations; and it was very certain that a few hun- dred dollars to a poor laboring-man would lay the founda- - tion of a fortune to his children., We should legislate for: posterity asq well as for ourselves. The circulation of the bank, Mr. Squeleh contended, would at least yield the annual interest of three millions of dollars. Out of this sum the interest on the foreign bonds could be paid, and a surplus of profit would remain of two imillion two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Allowing fifty thousand for current expenses,/salaries, &amp;c., and even itwo hundred thousand dollars for bad debts, there would "still be two millions of dollars on hand, out of which to defray the expenses of the Government, thereby relieving the people from taxation, besides creating a large fund for common schools and internal improvement. This plan had been maturely weighed by Mr. Squelch, and he was confident it would form a new era of prosperity and intel- ligence among the people. The masses began to feel their \  ^                 '    '  ' t    .        -   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       161 strength, and their individual capacity for happiness. Whether cultivated by letters, or in the darkness of neglect, they were generally honest, and a helping hand should be extended to them,-an occasional plank thrown overboard in the storm to prevent them from drowning. Let a man once taste good fortune, and that, too, from the paternal hand of Government, his patriotism is quickened into lively exercise, and he becomes more than ever the bone and sinew of the country. Whether these arguments produced conviction of the expediency of such a scheme of finance, or not, the bank was established, its officers elected, and the whole ma- chinery was put in operation. Notes and bills of exchange from five hundred to ten thousand dollars each were offerefl in all seventy-five millions, being just two-fifths more in amount than the law of the bank authorized to be dis- counted on the specie basis. The quantity of certificates was formidable enough; and it took most of the time of the directors to read them and to report the names properly vouched. The offering-book showed fifty thousand notes and bills of exchange endorsed and certified, averaging fifteen hundred dollars pressed for accommodation at the counter of the bank. To prevent any discrimination or injustice, the directors discounted each note and bill of exchange for three-fifths of the sum on its face, and then, deducting the interest for ninety days, paid over the proceeds to the party entitled. To expedite the busi- ness so that all might' be waited upon in bank-hours, the directors instructed the cashier and teller to issue bills of the larger denomination, of one hundred, five hundred, and a thousand dollars. Smaller bills were only used to make change, unless parties desired them for their own c6in- venience. The result of this financial movement on the price of property, and the benefit afforded to all classes, was thus proclaimed in the i Expositor."

We understand that the amount of paper offered for discount w8s very large, far beyond the ability of the directors. A fro-rata scale was adopted, by which each party received three-fifths of the sum for which he applied. "We already perceive a decided rise in the value -of pro- perty of every description, especially in real estate. Lands hitherto dull at five dollars per acre are commanding fifty per cent. advance. Individuals who were indebted have the means of breathing free once more, or at least of ex- tending their liabilities one year, until another full crops can be made, which isUll-important. We congratulate the people of the Stateion the accommodations thus afforded them. The Growler faction, who alone opposed the bill establishing the bank, will, we -trust, be perfectly silenced b  the beneficent effects of the measure. "There is one fact which of itself alone ought to secure unlimited confidence in the new institution,--the character of its president, the Hon. Felix Grinder.' This gentleman is clear-headed and prudent, and fully sympathizes with the people. The directors are not less worthy of public esteem. They have been selected for their integrity and financial wisdom, and it is believed that their actings and doings will meet the approbation of the people, for whose good the bank was called into existence. / "The specie in the vaults of the bank is fifteen millions of dollars, derived from the. sale of State bonds to that amount, having twenty years to run, at an interest of five per cent. The late discounts of forty-five millions yield an intereot of nine hundred thousand dollars for ninety days.   From this sum  deduct one hundred and eighty- seven thousand five hundred dollars, the interest on the bonds for the same period, and a balance of seven hundred and twelve thousand five hundred dollars clear profit re- mains, making at the end of the year dess the incidental   i        THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       163 expenses) the sum' of two million eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the credit of the State treasury. Such is the balance-sheet in a more financial view. The best of all, however, is the happy influence it will have among the people themselves. They see and feel, for the first time, the liberality of their own Government in providing for their necessities, as the circulation is sufficient to give every man, woman, and child, white and black, bond or free, more than fifty dollars,-a rate of distribution which no other Government has ever authorized with its money. Eternal success to thl principles of that party which has done so much for the working-classes!" The money-ship was thus launched, amid great rejoicing, and the maiden voyage was completed in fair weather: that is to say, the bank had a smooth time for ninety'days. Except from the merchants who wanted exchange on the North, and the stock-drovers of the West, and certain other traders who demanded coin or checks, there was no particular call for specie during this period. The amount paid to them did not exceed one million of dollars. Every bill-holder was satisfied when he looked at the emblems, Cotton, Rice, and Tobacco, with a Steam-Boat ready to carry off these commodities to market, engraved on the bills, under the protection of the American Eagle, whose outspread wings gave safety -to the whole. The time of renewal came; more certificates were ne- cessary, for the reason that a change in the condition of the parties might have taken place for the worse. The first year passed, and at least half amillion of certificates, including all the renewals, had been filed with the di- rectors. About twenty per cent., or nine millions of dollars, had been paid into bank by the borrowers. There was still an outstanding circulation of, thirty-three millions. The bills of the bank were taken by the brokers- at the 1North at two per cent. discount. These gentlemen fre- quently drew large sums of money. The Southern banks *.^  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7248-00000083"/> 164       WILKINS WYDER; OR, generally settled every fortnight with the "General Re. lief," and considerable balances- were stated against it. These were left on special deposite, or checks taken' for the amount. The banks did riot think it good policy to commence a specie run upon each other, and so there was no excitement. In the mean time the directors had themselves become heavily indebted to the bank. One gentleman, who was a commission-merchant, had been accommodated to half a million of dollars, on his acceptances for planters in ad- vance of their crops. Another member of the board had bought wild lands extensively, and his paper had been discounted, in different combinations, for two hundred thousand dollars. A third member had started a new town at thet head of navigation on the Kalamazoo River, maps of which he caused to be engraved and hung up in all public places from Boston to New Orleans. 3He ex- pected to realize a million on the fifty thousand loaned him by the bank to carry out his speculation. A fourth -director had put up extensive variety works at a favorable point for such business, and, to enable him to complete his establishment, the bank had discounted his paper for one hundred and te thousand dollars. A fifth director had erected a set of merchant mills which, were much needed; and, to help so laudable art enterprise, his brother directors had taken his paper, with very inadequate signatures, for eighty thousand dollars. A sixth gentleman of the board became a stockholder in a line of steamers from tlfe South to New York; and, as this communication had been long wanted, he was supplied with three hundred thousand dollars by the bank on nominal security, promising soon to substitute regular paper. A seventh member, believing that he had as much right as any one else to -bank favors, succeeding in getting one hundred thousand dollars on his own responsibility,as he was known to be a very close manager of money on the Shylock principle of cent. per          *            *   THE SUCCUESFUL MAN.       ;165 cent., as the opportunity might allow. The other three directors asked for no accommodation. They were satis; fied with their salaries, and thought the bank had plenty of customers without their increasing the list. The presi- dent stood aloof from all speculation. He never touched a dollar of the money for himself or his friends after he had signed the bills officially and delivered them to the cashier to be registered. At most of the meetings of the directors he was present, and took part. His votes on -the minutes of the board were often in opposition to the majority; and in a few instances his formal protests were entered. These generally referred to loans made by mem- bers of the board to each other. He looked upon these as wholly irregular, and involving the morality of the ma- nagement. Several years passed, and the bank found its debtors slow of payment. A great deal of their paper had gone to protest. The people had become tired of renewals, and the expenses attending them. By a rule of the bank, which was published in the newspapers, the certificates of the clerks of the circuit and county courts, under their seals of office, were necessary to be attached to every note or bill of exchange offered for discount or renewal. By law, the clerks were entitled to one dollar for affixing their seals to any paper. When the people had to Obtain so many cer- tificates, they felt the expense, and murmured; and the clerks, willing to soften the hardship, agreed to take half price. This was fair enough, and proved a source of much profit to the clerks, who-from first to last received more than one hundred thousand dollars for this kind of service. Members of the Legislature became wearied, and many of them lost their patience- in this endless labor of granting certificates that A, B, and-C, makers and endorsers, were men of property and good for the amount specified. They had whole quires of printed blanks, ready to be filled up,  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7248-00000084"/> Lo-       WILKINS WYDER; OR, to lessen the trouble. On frequent occasions they gave certificates, without knowing the signatures, or the respon- sibility of the persons applying. But for the sake of obliging them, and it may be of securing favor in the election, or, what is most probable, yielding to importunity and assurances upon honor that'TaFwas right, they seldom, if ever, refused a certifcate. Thus a great deal of written trash accumulated in the bank, and much that was not reliable for what it professed. Mutterings of a financial panic in Europe began to be heard across the Atlantic. Foreign capitalists had invested more than two hundred millions of dollars in American stocks, besides the commercial balance, which was estimated at one hundred millions more. Trade in Manchester, Shef- field, and other large manufacturing districts in England had been thrown out of its regular sphere, and riots werek the consequence. Large shipments of specie were made to Europe from New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other Northern ports. American credit had suffered an eclipse, and a dark storm menaced the future. CHA PTER   XXII. THE banks, from Maine to Louisiana, suspended specie payment. There was a financial crash throughout the world.  The gazettes of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans were filled with the names of commercial men of high rank who had gone overboard in the gale. There was a  general distrust of credit. -Even the planters of the South were largely in- volred, and in no State worse than that in which the Bank of General Relief was located. " This mammoth institution had also closed doors, after paying out twelve millions in gold and silver. All was painful uncertainty; no man Y P   THE SUCCE88SSFUL MAN.     10[O could see a ray of light: the gloom was thorough. Money, debt, banks, ruin, were words in every mouth, like meat and bread, though, unfortunately, they did not afford the same nutriment. A few men committed suicide in moments of despair, and many rich families became poor. In a few mjonths the Legislature assembled, to which Mr. Wylder had been again elected. The Governor's mes- sage gave a melancholy picture of things. Taxation had been several years abolished, and the Government sup- ported from the profits of the bank. It was doubtful whether enough could be saved from the assets of that insti- tution to pay the bonds when due. His Excellency dwelt at much length on the painful crisis, and recommended the Legislature to apply such remedies as their wisdom might devise. At an early stage of the session Mr. Wylder offered a resolution appointing a committee of five to examine the affairs of the bank, and especially to inquire whether any of the directors were indebted; if so, how much, and their names respectively; whether any frauds had been com- mitted by discounting spurious paper, and if so, what members of the Legislature had certified it; whether there had been any combination of persons to obtain money from the bank on signatures notoriously worthless; and if so, who were the persons engaged in it, and what sums of money were thus obtained, and what members certified this kind of paper; how much money had been paid for extra services, and to whom; and to examine the offering and discount books, to see if any partiality had been shown in the action of the board, and to exercise a general scru- tiny over the transactions and condition of the bank--for which purpose the committee shall be authorized to send for persons and papers, and to report by bill or otherwise. When first read at the clerk's table, this resolution ex- cited astonishment. It presupposed many irregularities in the bank, and opened the door to such wide investigation, f r  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7248-00000085"/> 168       WILKINB WYDER; OR; imposing the most onerous labors on' the committee, that it was looked upon as a firebrand hurled into the Assembly for purposes of mischief. ' One member, Mr. Duke, was not disposed to alarm the country by giving such vast powers to any committee until he was. assured by the mover of the resolution that- he had reason to believe that fraud and mismanagement existed in the bank, as implied by the re- solution. He had never heard of such things, until the resolution was read-to the House. His vote for or against the investigation would depend altogether on the reply of the genltleman from Franklin,      ' Mr. Wylder said that enough had transpired within his own knowledge to render the- investigation he proposed necessary. He would be the last to insinuate a word to the prejudice of any person, unless he had sufficient cause. As to the doubts of the gentleman from Madison, (Mr. Duke,) they could be effectually relieved by serving on the committee, or by waiting for its report and the evidence to sustain it. The resolution was then adopted by unanimous vote, and Mr. Wylder was appointed chairman of the committee, and Mr. Duke one of its members. Bank frauds, and the disclosures expected from the committee, were general topics of conversation, and soon reached the public through the press, as may Se seen by a paragraph in the "Expositor." -   , "Our readers will be surprised at the resolution we publish to-day, which was offered by Mr Wylder in the House of Representatives, in relation to the bank. We knew that some of its affairs were complicat-ed, which must necessarily be the fact from its -large business and the diffi- culty inherent in the banking-system itself; but that there had been any thing immoral in its-management, or that fraud had been committed by false paper or corrupt certificates, is what wd did not suspect. The committee is constituted- of five able and impartial gentlemen, at whose head is Mr,    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       169 Wylder, known for his qualifications to disentangle a com- plex subject. There is not a more solid or penetrating mind in the Legislature. We shall lay before our readers from time to time such fragments as the committee may think proper to furnish in advance of their final report." The committee at, once proceeded to the investigation. A general statement of the bank was required, showing its capital stock, and the assets'on hand to represent it. The first inquiry related to the indebtedness of the directors, and they were called on for explanations. The committee then prosecuted their labors in the order of the resolution, which occupied them closely for two weeks, at the end of which time they reported to the House, in substance, as follows:-- 1. That seven of the directors had discounted each others' paper, at various times, for more than a million of dollars on inadequate security. 2. That eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars had been obtained on paper the makers and endorsers of which could not be found after diligent inquiry, and it was clear that no such persons lived in the State. The names of members of the Legislature who certified the signatures were set forth in the report. 3. That proof had been adduced to the committee tend- ing to show a strong combination between certain indi- viduals to impose worthless signatures on the bank, by which they succeeded in obtaining seven hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars. The committee were of opi- nion, from the bvidence, that five members of the last Legislature and two of the present were interested it the fraud, and that they received a portion of the money. The mode of operating, so far as it could be ascertained in the brief examination allowed, was that men of bad repu- tation came to members of the Legislature with, notes already signed, stating that the makers and endorsers were perfectly good, and only needed half the sums ex- 15  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7248-00000086"/> 170       WILKINS WYDER; OR, pressed on the face of the notes; and that, if it would be any accommodation to the members, they would be wel- t come to the use of the other half, without security or note, until the -parties called for it. On these terms the signa- tures were certified by seven members of the Legislature whose names were given in the report, with the sums each received on notes entirely worthless. 4. That there had been no sum paid for extra services beyond what was reasonable and proper. As a compensa- tion to the bank-attorney for visiting a renote part of the State and securing a large debt which the bank would otherwise have lost, the bank allowed him one thousand dollars over his usual commissions. There had been several sums, small in amount comparatively, paid to the clerks for labor after night in keeping up the offering and discount books, and in making other entries of a similar kind, after bank-hours, to guide the directors in their action. 5. That it was difficult for the committee to determine by an inspection of the offering and discount books whether or not the directors had. exercised partiality in the choice of paper. The, fact was apparent, however, that persons of questionable responsibility had been accommodated to large amounts, while men of the most undoubted character had been refused altogether, or obliged only by inferior sums. This conduct has the appearance of partiality; and in a few instances the committee have traced such intimate personal relations with the directors, and such motives of favor, as to strengthen the presumption. . 6. That the bank has paid the interest- on the State bonds up to the first day of January next. The outstand- ing circulation of the bank is six millions, to retire which it has assets consisting of promissory notes and bills of -exchange amounting to twenty millions, and three millions in specie, showfng a nominal surplus of two millions after the bonds and circulation shallbe redeemed. The bank   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       171 also paid two millions of dollars for the support of Govern- ment since the State tax has been abolished. As to the availability of the assets, the committee have no data on which to found an opinion. There is a large amount lost by fraud and bad debts. As the names of the debtors are arranged by the respective counties to which they belong, nearly all of them unknown to the committee, a resolution is subjoined by which the quality of the debts may be' ascertained. The committee also reported a bill authorizing the ap-  pointment of a receiver, to take charge of the effects of the bank, to collect the debts due, and to apply the pro- ceeds je the payment of the State bonds issued for the capital stock of the bank. They concluded their report with a resolution that the Senators and Representatives shall examine the list of bank-debtors for their respective counties, and shall mark opposite to each name the letter G, B, D, or U, as the case may be, signifying that the debts are good, bad, doubtful, or unknown, and that the receiver V shall report the same to the Governor, who shall cause a table of the counties, with the sums thus classified, to be published in the-newspapers for the information of the people. When this report was read,in the House, it produced quite a sensation All eyes involuntarily turned on the two members wh were designated as having received money for granting certificates to be used in bank. These gentlemen manifested much uneasiness, and after hastily conferring together, and signing a paper which they sent to the clerk's table, they retired from the Hall. The reading of the paper being called for by several members, the clerk read as follows:- "To THE HON. SPEAKER:-The undersigned have heard, with indignation and scorn, certain charges against them in the bank committee's report just submitted to the House. As was natural, the undersigned attracted general obser-  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7248-00000087"/> 172       WILKINS WYDER; OR, vation, 'which, to persons wholly innocent, as we know ourselves to be, was in the highest degree embarrassing. Were the session not so near its close, we should demand an investigation of our conduct, and call for the proof; but as there is scarcely time remaining to finish the busi- ness already on the calendar, we hereby resign our seats, and shall go before our constituents to stamp the calumny as it deserves at the next election. - In the mean time we notify all -persons that we shall hold them individually re- sponsible for all repetitions: of the slander in this Hall or elsewhere, and that our redress shall be such as we may elect, either under the code of honor or by legal pro- ,ceedings. "We retire from your body, that our persons may not be offensive to delicate nerves, and to satisfy the committee that they have wounded their game,--no doubt, a matter of more exultation with them than all the other branches of their random and ponderous report. We have the honor to be,                J. GOING, R. GONE." Just as the clerk finished reading this communication, Mr. Files took the floor, and, with a gravity altogether un- ; usual with him, moved that it be spread on the Journal of the House as a vindication of the retiring members, and for the additional object of preserving on record the gra- cious warning given to. all who may hazard their lives or their property by repeating the slander contained in the report of the bank committee, levelled at them, the said re- tiring members.  Mr Wingard rose to second the motion. It was only fair that the antidote should follow the poison. The report of the committee would appear in the Journal, and the defence should also, in juxtaposition. The two -gentlemen had retired from the Hall in a fit of honorablepgassion; and we should be thankful that they left us some token of remembrance. f   173 THE SUCCESSFUL MAN. Mr. Wylder disclaimed any personal reflections or -10tives in the report which it had been his duty to make. He certainly had no cause for unkindfeelings, as the re- tiring members were known to him by sight only. As to the epithets applied to the committee, they cannot be noticed, nor would he abstain from giving the report the widest circulation merely because the- accused had been rash enough to denounce all those who might talk over the items of a public document. As to the investigation which they profess to desire, they can have a full opportunity to maintain their innocence before the tribunal to which their conduct will be referred. This was the substance of Mr. Wylder's remarks. He concluded by offering a resolution instructing the Attorney-General to prepare bills of indict- ment against Jonas Going and Roderigo Gone, late mem- bers of the Legislature, for the offence of bribery, and that he- consult with the president of the. bank as to the proof; which was adopted by the House.   The  "Expositor" noticed the charge in the following terms:-  "A very painful disclosure was made in the House of Representatives on Friday, by Mr. Wylder, chairman of the bank committee, implicating no less than seven mem- bers of the Legislature, two-of whom occupied seats at this session. It is stated in the report that Mr. Going, of Ca- manche, and Mr. Gone, of Flipton, were prevailed upon to sign certificates vouching for worthless signatures, by a promise of half the money that might be received on the paper. The contract was executed at the loss of seventy thousand dollars to the bank. "We are at a loss to imagine that -such a betrayal of confidence was possible in our State. The two gentlemen, Messrs. Going and Gone, have resigned their seats, and pledged themselves to disprove the charge. A resolution has been adopted by the -ouse to. have indictments pre- ferred so as to allow them the opportunity to fulfil their boast. One of them belongs to the Graball and the other &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7248-00000088"/> 174       WILKINS WYDER; OR, to the Growler party: so that 'honors are easy' in this game. "It may turn out, when the matter is fairly sifted, that the gentlemen, who are said to be largely engaged in land- speculations, had need of funds for a special trade from which they counted on heavy profits, and when the certifi- cates were applied for, they intimated that, if all the money obtained on the notes was not wanted within the given time, they would' be glad to have the use of a portion, subject - to call. This being the case, the gentlemen will no doubt return to the bank the sums they received on the paper which they certified to be good, but which, contrary to their impressions, turned out to be otherwise. In that event-they will have relieved their characters from the prejudice now existing against them."' This editorial paragraph was so judicious, and the ex- planation of their conduct so very proper, that Messrs. Going and Gone, in the course of a few days, issued a card ' in the "Expositor." "{MR. EDITOR:-Without our having the least claim on your generosity, you have been pleased to refer to us, in our persecutions, in a spirit the very opposite of that which has been manifested for our destruction in certain quarters. While we defy our enemies, we are grateful for friendly service, such as you have been kind enough to render us. You had the sagacity to perceive, and the frankness to declare, the real facts which gave rise to the imputations against us. We obtained the use of the money at a time when we needed a large sum; and, having suce ceeded in the enterprise, it subjects us to no inconvenience whatever to refund to the bank all the money which they. paid for this worthless paper, as it has been denominated. We enclose you a duplicate of the cashier's receipt, and beg you to publish this note. Yours respectfully, J. GOING, R. GONE." /  ,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      X 175 This publication greatly amused the members of the Legislature. They gave a champagne party to the editor, increased the rates of the public printing, and by a unani- mous vote elected him State printer in acknowledgment of his ingenuity and success in saving to the bank a large sum of money. So much for a stroke of policy, influenced altogether by the fact that the honor of the Graball party was involved with one of the delinquents. The Growlers were equally assisted in wiping off the stigma from their escutcheon. This example cannot be followed generally, because circumstances seldom give such a fragrant oppor- tunity; but the lesson it teaches may be useful,-that gentle words, even to the erring, accomplish the most good. Men may be sometimes overtaken by a fault, the consequences of which they would fain repair, if terms of degradation were not at once applied to them, and their spirits broken. On the night before the Legislature adjourned, Mr. Wylder gave an entertainment at the ,La Grange Hotel, to all the members, State-house officers, reporters of the press, editors, and a number of special guests. HisI object was to take leave in a pleasant manner of those with whom he had business or social relations during the wihter at the seat of government, as he had resolved not to be a candi- date for re-election. The dining-saloon was handsomely decorated, and the table covered with luxuries. Every guest seemed to be in a good humor, and Mr. Wylder him- self never appeared to better advantage. After the wine began to circulate, Judge Willets, a most inveterate toaster, rose to his feet, and thus addressed the company. "GENTLEMEN:-Though our friend, to whose hospitality we are indebted for this delightfuffeast, has not organized our multitude by placing a president at our head to'keep order, by which very omission he has manifested his con- fidence in our capacity for self-government, I am disposed to avail myself of the liberty which the Constitution secures to all- in this broad Republic, and more particularly with a x                   4  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7248-00000089"/> 176       WILKINS WYDER; OltR, view to increase the happiness of our kind entertainer, to propose a sentiment which I hope will be responded to with perfect unanimity:-- "The Hon. Wilkins Wylder. His Graball resolutions and his bank report are creditable to his head; and it be. hoves him to vindicate his heart by renouncing bachelor life." All glasses were raised and- emptied in approbation of this sentiment, Mr. Wylder was loudly called for, when he rose and gracefully acknowledged the tender concern which his friends had expressed for his domestic tranquillity. He believed 'in the doctrine of popular instruction, and was inclined to construe the sentiment offered by his esti- mable friend which had been sowell received by the com- pany, as the advice of experience, and equal to a com- mand, "Go thou and do likewise." In return fortlhe kindness, Mr. Wylder proposed,-- "The Ladies. Honor to them first, and to country after- ward. Without the smiles of woman, there would be no incentive to patriotism. Disguise the fact as we may, we covet their approbation more than riches and honor. Un- less these can be shared by her, they are robbed of their chief attraction." Thunders of applause greeted this announcement. More than a dozen speeches were made. The best feeling pre- vailed, and at a suitable hour the company retired, all happy--none incapable of locomotion. And thus ended the festivities designed by Mr. Wylder to close his Leg-s- lative career. J  *       t t '          '   v   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       1" --  CHAPTER XXTII. ON his return to the paternal mansion, Mr. Wylder was greatly distressed to find that the health of his aunt, Mrs. -Ringford, was in a hopeless decline. He consoled her by all the little attentions it was in his power to'bestow. Whenever he entered the sick chamber, a smile lighted her face, and tears of grateful affection stood in her eyes. She desired to thank him for his generous and noble conduct in New York, where she had been among strangers. Since then, her feelings had undergone a happy change, as she wished to be at peace with the world. Those who had injured her, she freely forgave. When her nephew urged the propriety of her being calm, as the indulgence of emotion might be hurtful in her feeble state, she re- plied that she had one duty to perform, and no time was to be lost. She had not seen her- sister, Mrs. Brampton, in many years. -That lady resided on the seaboard, and had sent a message soon after the elopement, forbidding any further recognition. Mrs. Ringford had obeyed thus far, and had never attempted to speak to her; but she could not die satisfied without addressing that sister once more, asking her forgiveness, and bidding her a last fare- well. She then requested her nephew to bring the little writing-desk which had been given to her in New York in the days of her pride, that she might place on record, with her own hand, the dying testimony of one sister to an- other, in the hope that all unkindness might be removed. The desk was placed before her, and she attempted to write; but her strength failed, and she sank upon the pillow exhausted. She then requested her nephew to \I  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7248-00000090"/> 178      WILKINrS WYnLDER; OR, write the words as she repeated them, which he did, as follows :- "WYDER 'HALL, January 4, 18-. "MY DEAR SISTER FLORENCE:-I am in a dying con- dition, and have barely strength to utter a few words as my nephew Wilkins commits them  to paper. Several years ago you had me notified that you would no longer own me as a relative. That my conduct justified this harsh denunciation, I pretend not to deny. I am conscious that I brought sorrow upon my family, as I know that I entailed it on myself, by the foolish step which cost me your love. But it is useless to repine. The mischief has been done. All my property has been taken from me by swindlers, and my name har been published as the victim- from one end of the country to the other. "There is such a thing, however, as good resulting from evil, through the merciful direction of Heaven. My hu. miliation in the eyes of the world brought me to seek aid from above. I thank -the good rector, Mr. Holton, for turning my thoughts within myself. I had previously looked to the world for all my enjoyments. The struggle was severe, but the victory came at last,-victory over my own evil dispositions and my boundless pride. Since then I have had constant peace of mind; and I have done more good by visiting and relieving the poor since my return to Wylder Hall, than I ever could have done without this Holy influence upon my:heart. I commend it to you, my dear sister. It will comfort you in many trials, and bear you triumphantly over the rive rf death when you shall be called, as I am now, to feel its cold billows. I die per- fectly resigned to my fate, and in love with all mankind. Forgive my errors; and I pray that you, and your hus- band and children, and all our dear relatives, may so walk in this life as to meet me in heaven, where there will be no more -separation.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       I l "My strength is exhausted in dictating this letter; and my last writing on earth is the signature which will remind you of your redeemed sister, 'MARY GUYON RINGFORD." By the aid of Mr. Wylder and the attendants, she was held up until she slowly and with a trembling hand wrote her name as above. The effort quite overcame her. Her eyes were} fixed tenderly on all the members of the family as they stood by her bedside. . Beckoning to her sister, Mrs. Wylder, to approach nearer, she moved her hands and lips as if she desired to kiss her. This token of love was given, and soon the spirit of the dying woman forsook its tenement of clay, and passed to a bappigr sphere. The funeral was attended by a large concourse, while the Rev. Mr. Holton officiated at the church. He spoke of his interview with the deceased, soon after her return from the North, in the midst of her sore troubles. She was then indifferent to religion, but, on his conversing with her a while, she became softened, gave way to tears, and re- quested him to receive her into the church. When the opportunity was made, she -came forward and gave him her hand. Her walk had since been pious, and her deeds of, almsgiving were well known. The poor had lost a friend, and the church a faithful member. The solemn occasion rendered it proper for him to say that the deceased had often declared, since her change of heart, that had she never lost her wealth she would in all probability have looked to it alone for happiness, and would never have experienced that joy of soul which had been her treasure in the close of life. The worthy rector proceeded to say that Heaven fre- quently turned what seemed to be great misfortunes into actual blessings in the end. Such had been the example of the deceased. Raised in the lap of wealth, and possess- ing high literary cultivation, she was prone, like others  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7248-00000091"/> 180       WILKINS WYDER; ORB  under similar circumstances, to seek happiness from the world. .She never seriously -entertained thoughts on re- ligion until after she had passed through the severest ordeal to which poor human nature could be subjected. She died at peace with mankind. Only a few minutes before her dissolution she signed a letter to her sister at a distance, which none but a Christian could dictate. In her death she obtained the victory. Blessed woman! Happy! thrice happy! The body of Mrs. Ringford was then deposited in the fanmily vault of Dr. Wylder, in the presence of a weeping multitude; but the memory of her charities will survive to other generations. CHAPTER XXTV. ]MR. WYDER had become too conspicuous in public esti- mation, and his ability too well established in party war- fare, to be passed over in the selection of candidates for Congress. His rival was the Hon. John Harker, whose term of service had just expired, and the Growlers sup- ported him for re-election. These two gentlemen were upon the best terms with each other personally, and made a list of appointments to discuss the questions at issue be- tween the two parties of which they were the standard- bearers. The first time they met was at the village of Dresden, where they found many people collected. Mr. Wylder was to lead off in a speech of one hour, and the same length of time was allowed Mr Harker to reply; after which they were to have half an hour to close up, alternately. MR. WYDER'S SPEECH. "FELLOW-CITIZENS :-I am glad to see so large a number of you. The sentiments I shall announce may seem at   THE S UCCESSFUL MAN.       181 first view a very singular method of gaining favor with those who may bestow or withhold the honor which I seek as a candidate. But I think you will-change your impres- sions when you hear me through. I cannot reach Congress without your votes, and, though I desire to serve you in that body, I will not so far sacrifice my respect for you and for myself as to repeat the old song of looking up to the fpeople for instructions. I have no incense of flattery' to offer you. I will not pollute my lips with insincerity by calling you intelligent, high-minded,-the virtuous people- the omnipotent sovereigns, whose voice is law, and who never decide erroneously! Were I capable of such declarations, you would all despise my hypocrisy, if you possessed only half the discernment ascribed to you. I shall reason with you, my fellow-citizens, as an equal,-as man talking to man, respectful, yet candid. "In the first place, I beg you to consider facts, and then to approve or reject my conclusions, as you may deem proper. I see before me not less than five hundred voters.- Of this number there are at least fifty, or one-tenth, whq cannot read or write a syllable. About fifty take news- papers, and inform themselves of what is passing in the world. These fifty readers can understand what is meant by a tariff for the protection of home manufactures; what the word revenue means; proceeds of the public lands, veto power, public deposites, distribution of surplus in the Treasury, equity of the old States in the public lands, naturalization laws, federal courts, diplomatic service, di- vision of power into executive, legislative, and judicial departments under the Constitution, delegated power, residuary power, federal and republican ideas of interpret- ation, causes of foreign war, national honor, Indian rela- tions, international code, fugitive-slave law, foreign and domestic tonnage, sanctity of the national flag, mutiny on the high seas, letters of marque and reprisal, contraband. of war, and a -variety of other interests calling for the 16  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7248-00000092"/> 182       WILKINS WYDER; OR, action of Congress. What a burlesque on common sense, what an-insulting mockery, for me or any other candidate to ask even the fifty newspaper-readers whom I have sup- posed to be present, to instruct their Representatives in Congress how to vote on any of these questions! Without any disrespect, I venture to say that out of these intelligent fifty there are not ten who understand half those subjects. It is no discredit to any of you to be destitute of this in- formation. You have not had the opportunity to acquire it, and your lack of knowledge is no moral crime. I have used this strong language to show the absurdity of going to the people for instructions, out of every hundred of whom there are not five who pretend to read the debates in Con- gress, or any books or newspapers throwing light on our political system. Excuse me, gentlemen, if I decline troubling you for directions in the public service when I know how little competent you. are to give them properly. "My remarks are to the point, and you know them to be true. I intend no offence. I neither presume on my superior judgment, nor do I fear your displeasure. I have, in my imagination, disposed of but one-fifth of this audience, -say one hundred,-half of whom cannot read at all, not even the votes they put in the ballot-box, and the other half are qualified to vote understandingly. Now, four hundred of you are not yet classified, and to these I make my respects. Not one of you takes a newspaper; not one has five dollars' worth of books in his house, unless by the merest accident. Not one of you can write ten lines correctly, or speak a dozen words in proper-connec- tion. You are so deficient in knowledge, so incapable of reflection, that you have never realized in your own minds how utterly unfit you are to give advice to a cultivated mind in affairs of Government, of which you understand only one principle, and that is to vote on election-day! And yet candidates have praised you to your faces for wisdom, have gained your support by their smooth flattery, and   THE SUCCESSFUL ,MAN.      183 you have gone on from election to election, innocently believing that you were entitled tot the compliment. No, fellow-citizens, it is all human weakness; and I will act to- ward you in a different way. I will proclaim what you all know to be the truth. At least three-fourths of you drink ardent spirits, and one-half of you are in the habit of get- ting drunk. It is disagreeable to witness a man in com- pany where an enlightened4 conversation is going on, who from his ignorance or intoxication, is wholly unable to take part. Yet are not such things of daily occurrence? Even a sober man unable to express his ideas is to be pitied; but what shall we say of the drunkard, who has lost all shame, and whose mind is very little above the brute? All these people are qualified voters; they are the source of power, they' can pull down and put up whom they please, from the Governor to a constable. I go to such voters for instructions to guide me in Congress? "If I had power, not an unlettered man or a drunkard should exist. Not that I wpuld drown them, or put them to the sword, or do them the least violence. On the' con- trary, I would lift them up, and show them a new life. I would establish schools all over the land, and make it penal for any head of a family to neglect sending his children to be instructed at the public expense. There should be no invidious cry about rich and poor, so far as a plain, sub- stantial education was concerned. All should learn to read and write, and should have a knowledge of figures to the rule of three. On this foundation, all might be well informed and happy. I do not say that all persons unable to read and write are necessarily miserable or degraded. If they happen to be moral, they are the most contented people on qarth. They have fewer cares. So that their absolute wants are satisfied, they crave nothing more. Many of them make property; and there is no good reason why they should not grow rich. Lacking cultivation, their plans or efforts are seldom weakened by sympathy for  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7248-00000093"/> 184       WILKINS WYDER; OR, others. This is a general rule, to which, of course, there are exceptions. All their energies are absorbed in a selfish direction. Knowledge is more liberal, and oftenldenies itself to make others happy. Wealth is no standard of virtue or of happiness. It is desired as the chief good because it is supposed to perform wonders for both mind and body, and is known to govern society. On this sub- ject, however, as well as on almost every other, men enter- tain different opinions.- I believe that a good man, how- ever ignorant of books, ought to be as well received as the most enlightened, and that no question should be asked as to the riches or poverty of either. A man's presence should always determine his value in society; at least, this is my rule of judging men. "Now, my fellow-citizens, you have listened to me patiently while I have been a little rough, using language which no man has ever taken the liberty of: applying to you before. But I have an object- to accomplish. I lknow very well that I cannot be elected. to Congress without your votes. Of course I desire to obtain as many of these as I can by honest means. I cannot go to each of you; I cannot visit all your houses to make myself better known; and I thought it good policy to treat you all to something new,-the plain truth. You have now heard it, and perhaps some of you are displeased. No man likes to be told of his faults, and nothing is more offensive than to be called ignorant. Here, gentlemen, I am in your crowd. Ignorance and knowledge are but comparative terms, and, contradictory as they seem, often exist in the same individual. Considering my opportunities-the many years I was under the best private tutor in the country--the ten thousand dollars my father expended on my education-my extensive travels-the large collection of books and philosophical apparatus always at my com- mand-the experience I have had in writing, and the great pains taken to form my style-the honored men in whose   THE SUCCUESSFUL MAN.       185' company I have been thrown-my service in the Legisla- ture, and all the efforts I have so industriously made to acquire knowledge:-taking all these things into the ac- count, I do not hesitate to pronounce myself the most ignorant man in this assembly. Such is my real opinion. In fact, gentlemen, I am awfully and disreputably ig-  norant. I have tried to comprehend the laws of the universe, with books, maps, globes, and apparatus, gi ing the explanation, all before me; but my feeble mind ould never grasp the subject. In relation to the planets and heavenly bodies, I was shown how eclipses were calculated to a minute years before their occurrence, and how to ascertain the distance of the sun and moon from the earth, the size of the planets, and the number of years it -took a ray of light to reach the earth from some of them. For instance, I ways told by the astronomer that the planet Jupiter was eighty-eight thousand miles in diameter, fif- teen hundred times larger than the earth, and four hundred million of miles distant, requiring a cannon-ball at the rate of five hundred miles an hour nearly a hundred years to pass from one to the other. It takes Jupiter twelve years to make his revolution round the sun, though he travels at the rate of five hundred miles a minute,-a speed sixty times greater than that of a cannon-ball. These things are all true, gentlemen; the science is true, and easily mastered by a strong, reflective, and patient mind; but, with all the careful study I could give it, I was never able to retain the vast conception five minutes, and I actually know but little more of these magnitudes than you do, who perhaps never read a work on astronomy or gazed through a telescope at the rings of Saturn. Other branches of science, gentlemen, I also failed to comprehend, for the want of mental ability. If a premium were offered for the most ignorant man living, I certainly should claim it; for , my ignorance is the result of stupidity, while your minds 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7248-00000094"/> 186       WILKINS WYDER; OR, have never been tried in the same field, and cannot be charged with failure. "Not only in the exact sciences have I failed to make progress, but I am very much confused in my ideas relative to our system of government. When I read expositions on both sides from the great minds of the past and present age, I am at a loss to decide between the arguments. I claim to be a follower of Jefferson, and think him the safest authority; but the opposite views of Hamilton are not to be despised, nor those of Marshall and Story. If I shall have the honor of a seat in Congress, I shall go there as a boy to school, to learn of my supe- riors. I have called over somewhat flippantly a list of topics to be considered, with most of which my acquaint- ance is but limited. "But I am not to blame for this want of information, any more than you are for not knowing the current news of the day which any newspaper would furnish. I per- suade myself that I am willing to learn, and that I can learn as occasion may require. For instance, when a measure is before Congress, I shall listen to both sides, and then weigh the reasons, perhaps shall even venture to take a share in the debate on such preparation as I may be able to make. Possibly I shall send you all, if I can find out each address, copies of my speech in pamphlet form, thus entitled:-' Speech of the Hon. Wilkins Wylder, of -, on the bill remitting duties on railroad-iron, plan- tation-machinery, imported cattle, &amp;c., delivered in the United States House of Representatives, January 12, 18--.' Look out, fellow-citizens, for such a document. It will be among you, in all probability. And then you can refer your school-boys, and young men who begin to feel the down on their chins, and a desire to read politics, to long columns of figures in my speech, showying how much iron has been manufactured in England and Wales for the last fifty years, how much has been imported into this cou try, *    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      187 the rates of the tariff at different periods, and the total yield to the treasury, &amp;c. This will be a learned table to one not in the secret. I can add something about Swede iron, and the process of making steel, and how much coal is consumed in the manufacture of a ton. All this would imply vast research; and you would boast to your children that you had voted for the great Congress man! "Such an array, I confess, would be quite imposing in print; but where did I get my figures? Where else could I get them, but from some commercial dictionary, and the reports of the Treasury Department? Perhaps I paid some skilful copyist a'few dollars to perform the labor for me, while I obtained all the credit! Thus it is at head-quarters. There is a show of greatness,-a paper ability,-often the hiring of another mind to compose the speech, either before or after its delivery; for half the speeches pub- lished are not in the shape as delivered. Custom allows a wide margin in this respect, and I may as well use the privilege, even though I, like numbers of other ordinary men, gain a newspaper celebrity by the innocent fraud, justified by an honest desire of fume! But I have said enough on this subject, and shall pass to another. "You perceive, fellow-citizens, that I have carefully avoided touching upon party creeds, or platforms, if you please so to call them by way of reproach; for there is no word in the English language that fills me with such overwhelming disgust as that word 'platform,'-a con- vention mummery. Let me tell you how these platforms are manufactured. A National or State Convention is agreed upon to nominate candidates for the party calling it. Delegates are selected months or weeks beforehand. Some two or three very adroit tacticians prepare a draft at home, so artfully worded that it means any thing, or nothing, just as the future may require to gain the most votes. There is a foreign- plank and a native plank-a Union plank and a States-rights plank-a tariff plank and  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7248-00000095"/> 188       WILKINS! WYDER; OR, a free-trade plank-a rigid-construction plank and an in- ternal-improvement plank-a specie plank and a treasury- paper plank-a rotation-in-office plank and a stay-in-faithful plank; fifty planks, from mahogany to -pine, all dressed to suit as many tastes,-tongued and grooved to keep out cold -at, the North, and to neutralize heat in the South, as the comfort of each section may be best pro- moted. Abominable contrivance; this, by some oily dele- gate who moves in convention that a committee of one from each State, or from each Congressional district, be appointed to prepare and report business proper for action. Of course he is made chairman, and then the committee retire and shut themselves up in a room, when the iHonorable Chairman draws from his pocket his preamble and resolutions and reads them to the committee, who adopt them word for word instanter. But, to keep up a show of deliberation, the committee ask until next morning to prepare their report. Such is the silly farce of a convention. I speak not at a venture. I have seen what I testify, and have practised a full share of the deception, the guilt of which I will endeavor to expiate by warning others in time. "I make no pledges of what I shall do in Congress if you elect me. You know my character, and you know how I have ridiculed this party management by thirteen resolutions in the Legislature. I shall speak and vote as -my conscience and judgment may dictate when the time comes. My mind is open to the truth, proceed from what quarter it may. It will be my constant aim to have all the light I can, and to consider maturely the measures which may come before m e for action. In this way my record will be kept from wilful blunders. I shall rise above the dark, polluted atmosphere of party, and endea- vor to revive a purer sentiment than has of late ruled the public mind, since men in high. places seem to have for- gotten their personal and official dignity -by appointing ,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       189 base men to office, merely because they were base in some party struggle. "Fellow-citizens, I have already taken up more of your time than has been agreeable to most of you, I fear. My course has been singular, I admit: still, I am candid in the opinions I have expressed. Some of you, possibly, inquire within yourselves whether I have no other way of court- ing the favor of the people. Strange indeed, it may be said, that a candidate should tell voters so plainly of their faults, and then give them no soothing medicine to heal their wounded sensibilities,-not even a drop of the social element which is the great panacea in elections. Even so, gentlemen. I have a painful experience to relate. The first time I was a candidate, I gave in to the prevailing custom of treating freely with ardent spirits at all public places in the county. On one occasion a man desired me to have his half-gallon jug filled with whiskey. I complied with his request; and under the influence of that whiskey! he committed a murder, for which he was hung. The re- collection has been disagreeable to me ever since. I have determined not to incur such risks any more. You are all now quiet and in a friendly humor. I shall not insult you by an invitation to make beasts of yourselves. Were I to have a barrel of whiskey rolled out, and its contents circulated among you, in less than an hour there would be half a dozen fights, pistols and bowie-knives used to the shedding of blood, and a general uproar would ensue, worthy of devils instead of mei,-votersfor CongressI Par- don me for entertaining too much respect both for you and myself to give any such mark of contempt for your understandings and welfare. If it shall be your pleasure to vote for me, I shall be gratified; if you think proper to vote -for my' worthy opponent, I shall not complain, nor question your motives. I could not value the trust, nor perform the obligations it imposed: on me, unless I felt  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7248-00000096"/> 190       WILKINS WYDER; OR, conscious that you supported me in consideration of some- thing better than bald-faced whiskey!" Here Mr. Wylder took his seat, amid the deafening shouts of the multitude. They said, "He will do, he will do: he speaks the truth. We like a bold man." Mr. Harker, the rival candidate, took the stand, and declared that he had nothing 'to say. Bis respected opponent had made such an original speech, so different from what he had expected, so carefully avoiding all the issues between the Graball and Growler parties, that he was not prepared to reply, nor should he make the attempt. At one time during the speech, when he thought a little refreshment would be necessary, he had intended to give a general invitation to partake; but the closing words of that speech had induced him to abstain from treating. Mr. Harker threw himself upon the indulgence of the people, and hoped they would not forget him at the ballot-box. In a few weeks thereafter it was ascertained that Mr. Wylder was- elected by a flattering majority; and the Governor at once issued his commission as a Represent- ative in the Congress of the United States. CHAPTER XXV. BE'TWE N the election and the meeting of Congress (an interval of two months) Mr. Wylder concluded to make a Western tour, ending at New Orleans, and to return in time for his departure for Washington City. At Cincinnati he took a steamer down the Ohio, intending to stop at the places he desired to see, or from which he could diverge into the interior to view the country. Soon after leaving the wharf, the boat made gallant speed, and Mr. Wylder was attracted below to examine the machinery, as   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       191 there was evidently great power at work. Passing near the furnace, he noticed a young fireman, whose sparkling eye, amid the smoke which had begrimed his features, conveyed to Mr. Wylder the idea of genius and of intellectual culti- vation. The young man wore a red flannel shirt, a leather girdle rgund his waist, in which was a sheathed knife, and on his- head a glazed hat, such as sailors usually wear. Approaching him, Mr. Wylder, in a friendly manner, re- marked that it was the most comfortable place he had seen on the boat during a cold day, and asked if he did not so consider it. The fireman replied that it was a confounded dirty place, but it was better than no place at all. This brought on a conversation. Mr. Wylder.-"From your voice and manner, I should judge you to be a little different from the men who do this kind of work. Will you allow me to express the opinion that you are an educated man?" Fireman.--"You are at liberty, sir, to inquire more than that, since you have been so kind as to take an interest in me.' W.-"Where are you from, and how came you here?" F.-"I am a native of   , and was a student at the university until about six months ago." W.-"It cannot be possible that you are one of the three students who disappeared so mysteriously, and who were supposed to have been drowned in a boat-excursion?" F.-," So it seems you have heard of the occurrence. What was said about it?" W.--"There was great distress among the relatives and friends. The societies of the college to which they be- longed passed resolutions of condolence, said many fine things about the talents and virtues of the deceased, and ,had their proceedings published in the newspapers." F.-"Do you recollect the names of the young men?" W.--"I am well acquainted with the fathers of two  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7248-00000097"/> 192       WILKINS WYDER; OR, of thcm,-Ogilby and Parke; the other, I think, was named Hardison." F.-"When did you last see the old gentleman Parke?" TV.-"In canvassing my district for Congress, I met him at Selkirk about five weeks ago. He was a warm friend of mine, and was much gratified at my election." -i-"So, then, I have the honor of speaking to a mem- ber of Congress elect, and a friend of Mr. Parke, of Luna- vlyle. May I inquire your name?" WT.--"I give my name with pleasure, without claiming for it the authority you suggest. My name is Wylder." F.-"Are you the author of the famous resolutions in the Legislature, which broke up the ancient usages of the Graball party?" W.-"I offered a set of resolutions to ridicule party platforms, which too often deceived the public." F.-"While I was in college, we had a warm debate on your resolution thanking Columbus for the discovery of America. One side vindicated its propriety, and the other side maintained that it was offensive as a burlesque." W.--"My object, clearly, was to overturn a practice which' had been abused; and I think I have succeeded in putting it down." F.--"I believe, Mr. Wylder, you visited New York to prosecute a set of swindlers, and that on the day of your departure a letter of yours to the Society of St. Andrew was published, containing friendly mention of your tutor, Mr. Wells, who had conversed with the great German poet Goethe?" W.-"I was in New York on that business; and such a letter as you describe did appear. Now, since we pretty well understand each other, I beg to know your name." F.-"To give you a proof of my confidence, I will re- peat a name which is on the family record in my father's Bible, but which I laid aside six months ago when I left college,-Blackstone Parke."  ,              ?   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      193 W.--"My dear fellowy, the discovery is most opportune. I would embrace you were I to obey my feelings; but, not wishing to attract observation for the present, I shall con- tinue to talk as if nothing of special interest had occurred. I claim to have jurisdiction over you for our mutual benefit." Parke.--"I resign myself into your hands, Mr. Wylder, since I have found it impossible to manage myself. May you have better success with your protege." W.-"Can you give me any information respecting your comrades, Ogilby and Hardison?" P.-"Yes, sir: they are on the boat. Hardison is second steward, and Ogilby is assistant cook. When my time comes to leave the furnace to-night, I will see them, and give you an interview if you desire it." W.--By all means. Would it not be advisable, how- ever, to conceal from them all that has passed between us, except merely that a gentleman from is on the boat, and then let-me manage them?" P.-"That's a capital idea. You can excite their curio- sity to suit yourself, and draw out some original remarks; for one of them is a character, as you will soon perceive." With this understanding, Mr. Wylder returned to the cabin, and saw no more of his college fireman until after supper. Having told the captain that he wished to see the second steward and the assistant cook, those individuals were summoned to the social hall, when Mr. Wylder, ad- dressing himself to Hardison, inquired if he had any desire to hear from his college associates. This was about ten o'clock, and a number of passengers were smoking and telling stories, some sipping toddy at the bar, and several were around as card-table. On hearing the remark about "college associates," there was a general stare of surprise, and it was manifest that a scene was brooding, which will be here related. Mr. Hardison, (Second Steward.)-"My friends have long N         17  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7248-00000098"/> 194       WILKINS WYDER; OR, given me up for dead; but still 1 would liked to hear from them." Mr. Wylder.--"The college societies have resolved that you were a bright youth, fallen too soon for your country. I am glad to meet with your ghost, which is so like your drowned body that your friends cannot tell the difference." H.-"Come here, Ogilby, and speak to this gentleman. You can represent us both." Mr. Ogilby, (Second Cook, assuming a tragic attitude.) ,Do my eyes deceive me, or do they behold A living son of Rockville on these floods? . Thou art welcome, thrlce welcome, to our hearts. If thou hast words to Utter, big with fate, Or sacred with domestic news, Open now thy lips. ' W.-"Thy poetry has unmanned me, and I stagger in this presence. Wilt thou return to thy father and behave thyself, as though thou hadst not grieved him by thy early death ." ' O.--"Return! Oh, joyful word! the gods will bless thee For thy boon. Did wild Chimborazo Rear his frozen summit to prevent, I would scale the barrier, and return." TV.--"Well do I approve thy resolution. Go with me to New Orleans; forsake thy occupation as cook; become a gentleman, as thou art by nature, and call upon thy friends, whose arms are open to receive thee from the grave." O.--"Thou, speakest nobly, and, warm responding, My grateful heart doth leap at thy request. Aptly thou dost speak of gentleman; Once I was caressed as such; But now this flannel shirt and these greasy Pantaloons do cry against that pretension. My purse is bare; no jingling silver Or potent bills bear me company;   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       195 Destitute I am, low, and crest-fallen. I No tailor, or clothing-merchant    I Will supply my needs on credit: -Otherwise I cannot be a gentleman, As thou dost require." W.-- Then I will advance thee what money may suffice to equip thee from head to foot, the very best thou mayest fancy on Chartres Street or elsewhere." O.--"Happy, more than happy, to embrace Thy generous intimation: I will so act,- Will choose coat, vest, breeches, hat, Boots, and under-garments to match; There shall be no disparity To mock the prodigal's return. All shall be of costly type And fitted well to my proportions." W.-"Then I will take thee to the best hotel, and we will sit together, devouring turtle-soup, or Guinea-pig, or canvas-back, or mutton-chops, or jumping frogs, as thy palate may prefer." O.-"Thanks, purveyor, for thy savory list, This high-born privilege to select my food. But if thou wilt eat the frogs thyself, And the balance to me give, Thou art worthy of my friendship." W.--"We'l not dispute on trifles. Far weightier things have we to master. Booth is playing at St. Charles, and we have him to see. Can thy stomach relish his per- formance, or will it turn at sight thereof?" O.--"Thou firest my brain by such tidings Restrain thyself of these mighty offers, Or 1 shall die from excess of joy. Booth, in Richard, I hare longed to see; I left my college-mates to see far less glory. When Greece sent her cry to Heaven Against the Turk, I rose in majestic wrath  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7248-00000099"/> 196       WILKINS WYDER; OR, And vowed to redeem her by this solitary arm. With this intent, I hastened me away From college halls. and'lovely maidens, And came to busy New Orleans, To ship mgeand my fellows to fair Greece. But, arriving late, too late, no stately bark Flapped her distended sails for the bleeding isle. Downcast, I strolled upon the wide levee, With burning heart and pallid brow. Distress my face o'erspread, and moved A tender hand to beckon me away. I followed, and with anxious mind The chances much did speculate. Not long did I remain on foot; When finding myself seated in a chair, In lonely room up-stairs, with cards so nice All spread upon a table, and piles Of gold changing hands,-just then, When I began to look amazed, and sigh, My friend a glass of cordial offered, Which, with thoughtful mood, I sipped, And soon darkness came before my eyes, To relieve me of all painful sights. When I awoke, I was on the banquette* laid, And so in exterior changed that myself I did not recognise, until watchman Took me to the guard-house, and there By gas-light I surveyed this noble form, Which had no garments on, save Shirt and drawers:- all else was gone. My new coat was gone, my purse and watch, Fine new boots, handsome small-clothes, Rich velvet vest and beaver hat, Italian silk cravat, silver tooth-pick,  ) "In New Orleans the side-walk of the streets is called banquette.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       197 Diamond ring,--all gone, forever gone! Among strangers was I thrown, distressed. I told my tale of sorrow to the man Who called himself an officer, and he Forthwith to the large hotel stepped And made known my sad condition. My trunk was sent, and I arrayed myself In suit of cloth, all fair to see. With travelling-cap I encased my head, And with velvet slippers soft, my feet; So that through. the mud I did walk Like a lame duck which had been plucked Of all his feathers and was ashamed thereat. In this new plight I to the hotel came, And pondered o'er my destitution. "Now, comrades, rise and testify If this was not my pitiful, my cruel case. When to the hotel I did return, Did I not disclose, if not word for word Precise like this, set forth, at least, In substance, my sad experience? Did I not apply to thee for funds To buy drinks and cigars, when Thou didst confess thy own needs In that behalf, caused by tiger-fight? - Hereupon our wits we together joined, And of stern necessity did counsel take. We had no money: not a dollar had we: All was gone,-mine from cordial oozed away, Yours by tiger sorely wrenched. Our hopes of Greece did vanish, and Jong Did we consider whathest to do. Struggling for life, we vengeance swore Against the tiger; then, pawning our surplus Clothing to the Jews, two golden eagles We did muster, and 'twas our all. [       17i  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7248-00000100"/> 198       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Then, with desperate resolution, all three  Rushed headlong at the tiger, To get back our loss, and more to win; When, lo! that savage monster, with paw. Wide extended, did sweep both our eagles Into his den, and badly sold were we. "Again we in council sat; The Jews had all our clothing, Except what to our bodies then did cling! Then to the Father of Rivers we did slowly walk, To gather consolation, by plunging blind Into his depths, to rise no more,    i Or by his floating crumbs and offal Our hungry appetites to appease. In this extreme we paused to look Far up the river, at his miles of masts And steamboat-chimneys huge and high. Then of life we thought, of river life,- The Western hoosier and the sportsman keen. Between the two we might pitch our hopes To grow as fate might roll the dice. This large Monarch caught our eyes, And to Captain Longcope we drew near On the boiler-deck; to him we spoke, And thus our tale unfolded:- 'Dear captain, lack you hands to-day? Steward, cook, fireman, or bottle-cleaner? We are the boys such jobs of work to do With uncommon skill and expedition too. Will you try us, captain? no work, no pay. Our limbs shall serve you night and day. We are educated men, but quite forlorn At present, though each was highly born. You smile, dear captain, and so do we, To stay on board, and on this inland sea.'   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       199 "This gallant captain on our forms did cast His eyes of penetrating search, and thus Did soothe our misery:--'For ignorant men, But strong-bodied, we do wages pay From twenty to thirty a month, and feed       I On ship-biscuit, pork and beans at will.. On the deck below we do them lodge, Allowing to such a class no cabin-rights. But you, young sirs, for this occupation Are too finely clad: doff your cloth And boots, and on your tender limbs Bind coarse flannel red, in form of shirts; And of Russia duck full trowsers make, Broad and strong for service rough. Into this condition yourselves transform, And let my eyes your figures greet.' "Such injunction we did observe By instant fulfilment, and ourselves by barter We did array in other costume, our trade to suit. To each of us, then, a place was given, As fitness and justice did preponderate. To Parke, a cold-blooded youth, the fire to stir, And pitch in fagots the steam to raise. Proud Hardison, second fiddle he did play To steward, his soul to tame, and passengers to please, By handing bread and fish, and turkey roast, Eggs boiled and poached, and tainted some From age, as at breakfast often was the case. For myself, the art of arts, the combinations Gastronomic, I did prefer, as then and there My palate tasted every dish, from mutton Boiled, to chicken salad and gravies pure.

And you, Floating Monarch of the Mississippi, No more five thousand bales Of planters' cotton on your spacious deck And stowed away, shall I behold. Engineers and pilots, to each of you My trembling lips do say good-bye. The voyage with me is o'er, and far To my childhood's home I now repair, To lay me down and die. Dear Longcope, My generous captain, once more, farewell!" The manner of Ogilby, while thus declaiming, had col- lected a crowd of passengers near him; and even the ladies came to that part of the cabin which afforded a view, within reach-of his splendid voice. His gestures were classical, and his modulation equal to that of a fine trage- dian. He was grave, and at times full of emotion. Such at least was the actor, to all appearance. A general burst of applause followed his last words. There was a spell to which every one yielded, and a mysterious influence. Never was genius more triumphant. A man just from the cook-room, who had been looked upon as a common menial, with no- cultivation, or pride of character, had suddenly cast off his disguise, and soared into the, regions of thought far superior to any who listened to him, in style and deli- very. The captain was embarrassed. He felt that he had \   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       201 been unjust,-that he had degraded a noble mind by the employment he had assigned the youth. Captain Longcope told Ogilby that, since he had discovered they were educated and well-raised gentlemen, he would not think of any fur- ther service by him and his two companionsvunder the con- tract. He then instructed the clerk of the boat to make out their accounts and pay them forthwith. Ogilby.-"To consult my friend I beg you A moment to allow: my nature, thus relieved From its leprosy, must seek a fountain pure, Where honor shall be cleansed. Thy money, captain, would have welcome been Had I cook remained; but now Methinks it would be base to take it. Friend of the wanderer, what sayest thou? Can I accept the wages in former days agreed? Would not the world on me bestow its frown For such a pittance earned by toil Of him in flannel shirt and canvas hat? May college sprig of such gain partake Without defilement to his bosom? Thy opinion, noble friend, shall govern." Wylder.--"The case is clear, good youth. Thou must receive the money: it is thine by honor and by patient work. Keep it separate from all other treasure. Get thee a purse of beads made by fairest hands, and therein put the gold and silver change which, by thy captain's order, may be paid thee; then hide it in thy desk, in the secret drawer thereof, and in thy will bequeath it as witness of thy reform, to stimulate thy children to virtuous deeds. This do, and let thy comrades follow suit. iHonor demands thy consent." The clerk then called all three of the discharged young men, and paid each his proper money. , The captain re- quested them to do him a special favor,-and he would take no denial, which was that Messrs Ogilby, Parke, and I   &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7248-00000102"/> 202       WIT KTNS WYDER; OR, Hardison should consider themselves on the footing of passengers,'and occupy seats at his end of the table, Mr. Ogilby on the right, as the place-of honor, by whose side Mr. Wylder would sit, and on the captain's left Mr. Parke, late fireman, would take the first seat, and Mr. Hardison, late second steward, would occupy the next. seat. This was the order in which the captain should dispose of his neiw friends among the other passengers. Ogilby.-"While my heart doth thank thee, captain, For thy noble purpose, be it known to thee And to this assembly that red flannel shirt Doth not become the sumptuous banquet, Where beauty, fashion, and wine prevail. The lynx-eyed Jew doth hold my better vestments And those of my companions in hypothecation For two golden eagles which the tiger seized. I pray thee, captain, excuse me from thy table, From offending honest passengers on thy boat, Who may by printed card declare That thou didst them insult By such disgusting exhibition as fireman, Second steward, and assistant cook on thy right. I know the world, and to its decrees subscribe; And for thy sake, dear captain, let us At the second table sit, with engineer and mate, Whose apparel with ours doth correspond." Captain Longcope admitted that he had never seen such subordinates as Mr. Ogilby had named at table with his passengers; but never before had he the opportunity of paying homage to mind and refinement in such conditions, and he should consider it the proudest act of his life to make this public manifestation of his feelings on the sub- ject. He was assured in his own mind that all the passen- gers would cordially approve the step, as it would remove the only barrier which hindered them, especially the ladies, from having free conversation with the collegians, headed   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       203 by their chief, whose off-hand poetry was recited with such pleasing effect. The captain said, if the least objection were shown on the part of any passenger, he should place his gentlemanly clerk at the head of the first table, to do the honors, while he would remain for the second table, to share the company of his three young friends. Ogilby.--"Well hast thou argued, and prevailed: To thy bounteous table in the morning will I repair, And feast on rolls hot from the stove, The dough of which to-night I did prepare. The clock strikes twelve: we should seek repose; And now in ample state-room I shall find That rest which the smell of oil denied below. Honest friends, one and all, good-night!" The first steward. then conducted the new passengers to the best state-rooms which were unoccupied. He was a jovial, obliging man, who had served in the same capacity on board of one of the packet-ships from New Orleans to New York.  He congratulated Mr. Hlardison, his late , second, on his promotion, but expressed his regret at losing such a good coffee-maker. At breakfast he should not be neglected in his choicest dishes. Thus the curtain fell upon the drama for the night. ' Next morning, the select passengers took their seats as the captain had requested,--the collegians having washed 9 their hands and faces, but in dress they represented the crafts they had just forsaken. The captain was very polite to them, addressing friendly words to each, and hoped the passage to New. Orleans would be rendered still more pleasant by the acquisition made to the society of the cabin. Ogilby.--"In this behalf thou art well assured, And well hbast thou: spoken: in his trunk My friend Parke a clarionet hath, And 'tis all his property that doth survive The wreck on which we went to sea  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7248-00000103"/> 204       WILKINS WYDER; OR, In, this huge Monarch: he can blow Like porpoise strong, and fill the ear With sounds fastidious and o'erpowering." Wylder.--"Your rest, I hope, Mr. Ogilby, was quite re- freshing? I fear we kept you up too late by our anxiety to hear you converse last night." Ogilby.--"For six tedious months, just now closed, My sleeping-quarters have no empire been. Six feet by three, with cabin-boy to share, Was all the space I had; but 'twas enough. Emerging thence to state-room, I did find A genial difference in the air to breathe. I am quite refreshed, kind sir, and beg You will hand me the mutton-hash. Waiter, can I your attention gain?" Waiter.-"Will you have tea, or coffee, sir?" Ogilby.--"Coffee I do prefer for morning use; Strong, by French rule made, and quite yellow." Waiter.--"Shall I help. your plate to mutton-chops, veal- cutlets, beef-steak, or fried fish, or all at once?" Ogilby.--"This aggregation thou dost propose, Good waiter, will save thee toil. Were I for single dish to send thee, On the journey thou wouldst expire By means of constant repetition." Waiter.--"Will you have a hot roll, sir?" Ogilby.-"With hearty will I accept thy offer. This white risen roll, so soft and nice, Was my performance last in the cooking-line. The dough I had just mixed as to social hall I sped, To receive emancipation from the stove." Captain.-' I have a dish made expressly for myself, and know not whether you will relish it. May I hand you some fried liver?" Ogilby.--"Does thy dish abound in swine's, or sheep's, Or calf's, or ox liver? What is thy report " e*   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       205 Captain.-"I think it is the hog's, with a sprinkling of the brains and sweet-breads. Shall I help you to some?" Ogilby.--"These are dainties which I do prize, And with my palate they do well accord. Besides, in boyish days I chose the bladder, With heated air well filled, to make report, Like young artillery, the chickens to affright." Waiter.--"Will you take hominy, or rice, sir?" Ogilby.- "On Carolina's sterile soil the plant Is small of growth; but on rich Santee It most luxuriates, and comes to grain. Of'your rice, waiter, I will partake; But as for hominy, on the hogs bestow it, Or give a portion to Parke, my friend." Wylder.--"You notice, Mr. Ogilby, that the ladies can hardly feed themselves, and half the table is in a roar at your peculiar style of conversation. I am afraid you will damage their health, delicate eaters as the ladies are even when most quiescent." Ogilby.--"Then I will cease: my tongue can find No utterance to a lady's hurt, in body or in mind. As for the creature man, fallen, wretched, His ideas of propriety I do commiserate. Unworthy as he is, I will not dry up The fountain of his joys,-his table-heaven. My pleasure I forego, another's sorrow to prevent." Here Mr. Ogilby became silent, and so remained until the party left the table. There was a hum of conversa- tion heard as the passengers finished their meal; but it evidently referred to their disappointment. They looked all the time as if they wished him to keep on with his poetry. In the course of an hour after breakfast, the captain informed Mr. Ogilby that the ladies wished to make his acquaintance, and that he would take pleasure in intro- ducing him in their cabin. 18         0  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7248-00000104"/> 206       WILKINS WYDER;. OR, Ogilby.-'"Never, until now, has been the time When I the ladies would presume to disobey. Heaven's first law forbids that to their cabin I should betake myself, with hope to please. There is order in the sun, the moon, the stars; Order in the seasons, in day and night; Order of celestial type in woman's beauty,- In her movements graceful, and in her love. Song is order, and dress is order; dress Rich and fashionable is better order still. I pray thee, captain, make my excuse On this wise :-I am in sailor's garb, Unfit for drawing-room, or ladies' converse. For their good opinion my thanks I give, And beg that you will so represent. But decline I must their rash solicitation :To expose myself and forget their due." The captain made known Mr. Ogilby's views, and soon he was commissioned to present the following memorial:-- "The lady passengers beg to assure Mr. Ogilby that his intellect, vivacity, and address have so won their esteem that they desire his company to improve an acquaintance which has just begun under the most interesting auspices. As to his style of dress, it only entitles him to increased civilities, because the ladies are apprized of the reasons why he assumed the disguise. A less accomplished gen- tleman-one with less genius and qualities less deserving- might be excused for attaching a high value to his dress, which perhaps would constitute his chief attraction. But we trust that Mr. Ogilby does not entertain an opinion so unjust to our sex that we cannot discriminate between false and genuine merit, in whatever garb it may appear. We hope our appeal, thus frankly made, will meet a gallant response        .  [Signed by thirty ladies.] On reading this paper, Mr. Ogilby looked earnestly at   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       207 Captain Longcope and on the group around him, and thus gravely exclaimed:- New life can the smiles of woman give to man. As resurrected from the dead I appear myself. Dead have I been these six months past, Buried and forgotten. I now stand forth More in pride and the majesty of mind Than in all the precious rays of fortune. My doubts are solved, my painful doubts, Whether for myself or my wearing-gear I was most appreciated by the fair. In silks and satins they delight to robe Themselves, and beautiful and gay to flourish. These are killers of mal' by gentle suasion, i  Captivity silent, though not less absolute. From such imperial -bonds may I be rescued, Whilst to gentle hands I myself commit. Onward, dear captain, and thy servant introduce." Leading him to the cabin, the captain said,- "I take much pleasure, ladies, in introducing Mr. Ogilby. He is too noble a specimen of his race to decline the request which I had the honor to present in your name. He pre- tends to think himself unfashionably dressed; but, all things considered, I doubt the tailor's skill to improve him in your estimation beyond the favor which you are now ready to bestow on him. I hope he will speak for himself" .\ Ogilby.-"O'ercome by this bright scene, These forms angelic and smiles divine, This preparation formal, and gentle witchery I I sink beneath my blessed burden, And ask, fair ladies, compassion of you all. What am I, that I should wear this laurel, This priceless crown of woman's approbation? True, I once a mother had; sisters have I still. She on whose breast my infant head was pillowed  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7248-00000105"/> 208       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Long in the grave has rested from her cares. I see before me gentle and loving dames, Whose thoughtful visage brings to mind My sainted mother, who is now in heaven. If from her home of light and joy She could now behold her erring son, Led off from home and a father's care To follow his wild fancies and see the world, She would bless you, kind-hearted dames, For your condescension in my behalf. And you, lovely maidens, forgive the hope That animates my heart and binds me your slave To be a slave to woman is man's highest honor: It is the source of his achievements grand: I, then, must claim your kind approval Of my intent in thus submitting to your call. When to my anxious sisters-whom I shall greet In all the fondness of a brother's love- I-who to them have been reported dead- Shall proclaim that you my soul did nerve To holiest resolutions and virtue strong,- That, drifting in the muddy tide of life, Crushed by adverse fate and darkest horrors, You received me in your midst With a11 the grace and pity of your sex,- Then will my sisters pray to meet you, As redeemed companions, in the spirit-land. , Such, fair ladies, my report will be When to my father's house the prodigal returns. There, in childhood's home, my sisters I shall meet, And they will clasp my neck, and weep for joy. Then I your kindness shall again declare. Stranger as I was, and in menial plight, Dressed as laborer, and greasy as a cook, To your splendid cabin I was invited; And here I take this sofa, myself to rest."   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       209 There was a general display of satisfaction among the ladies with the new visitor. The leading belle, Miss Carrie Nicholson, came up to him laughing, and with most pro- voking archness said, "Suffer me, Mr. Ogilby, to bathe your temples with cologne. You are a little exhausted from your speech, and it contained beauties enough to ex- haust any person. I have a selfish object in reviving you immediately; for I wish to promenade on the hurricane- deck, as they call it, and I desire to take your arm for support." Ogilby.- -"Thank you, gentle lady: thy words So sweet, and thy smiles so luminous, IDo impart new life to this exhausted frame. My arm thou shalt accept, and to the deck Of this floating Monarch I will lead thee, Where autumn breezes thy cheeks shall fan, And Nature pay homage to thy presence. ]Hence, fair one, now let us proceed, In resolute advance of the timid throng, Who shrink from fear of falling overboard. These steps will take us on the wheelhouse tall, And these higher still on the area of this Ark, Large as that of Noah, whose fearful voyage Came to propitious end on Ararat's peak, And there man and beast did go ashore, -a Scattering in all directions,-Japhet, our sire, And Ham, the black man's ancestor, And Shem, the Indian's coppered father, Who with bow and arrow the stag doth hunt, As in boyhood reckless I the birds pursued. Come, fair lady, in what dost thou delight?" Miss N.--"To listen to the music of thy voice, and feel the vibrations of thy manly heart, as with trusting confi. dence I do incline my feeble strength to gain assistance from thy heroic arm. Dost thou not sympathize with my determination?" iT  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7248-00000106"/> 210       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Ogilby.--"Yes, lovely maiden, still more; thy mind An-d charms refulgent with heavenly light Seem like seraph with celestial voice attuned To richest harmony, which doth my soul entrance. Thy sceptre I confess, and, to give thee proof, I will headlong plunge into these waves; As Leander across the famed Hellespont, So will I buffet the turbid stream below us, To convince thee of my fealty to thy person. Art thou romantic, maiden, to relish This surrender of myself to thy dominion?" Miss N.- For thee it will not be good thus to act. Thy soul is yet impure, and it would be presumptuous to cast thyself unbidden in the jaws of death. Wait thy appointed time; solace thy friends; love thy father, sister, and, more than all, devote thyself to some lovely E xpression herein doth fail me, and the picture thou must complete in thy imagination." Ogilby.--"Gracious lady, I know thy noble house, And the blood exalted that warms thy heart. Were I to thee better known, the heritage of name And fortune which at thy feet I yield, Thou wouldst indeed forgive the daring thought Which now this throbbing bosom doth invade. But thy ire I will not provoke, lest thou Shouldst call some cavalier bold, To cast me in the flood for insubordination." Miss N.-"Why thou dost hesitate thy passion to declare, is full of mystery: thou art my equal, nay, my superior, in all the attributes of life. No estates of cotton or of sugar, however vast my dowry, could balance in the scale of thy proud intellect, which, towering to heaven, proclaims Csesar and Milton one in thee. If thou drawest back from thy menace, I shall regard thee as in sport, and that thou hast mocked my intimation." Ogilby.--"Forgive, dear lady, a truant whisper.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      2" Thy position I well do comprehend. Thou didst find me in the lowest sphere; Coffee hast thou drank distilled by me In kitchen service, and rolls and cakes Hast thou tasted of my preparing, on this boat. Merest casualty from such labor-did me relieve, And now you patronize my renewal By friendly words and generous condescension. I   If Caesar brave and Milton glorious are in me united, As thou hast signified in thy burning praise, I do beseech thee to forbear thy sparkling jest, And let calm verity succeed the humor. Of thee no sacrifice will I demand To execute the bond, till in course of time I more than prove all that thou desirest. To my ambitious soul new aids will spring From this tender consultation, as in hope Of thy devoted love I toil for fame. If pledge like this will thy sanction gain, Then at thy feet all my hopes I lay. In future, if -o'er thy mind a change should come, And this engagement in the way should prove, Then in purest honor thou mayst obey thy will, And in friendship's register my name inscribe, In ample substitute of this present high betrothal. Margin like this I do grant to thy discretion, And equal judgment shall I retain, To hold our compact sacred, until dissolved By wish of either party to this fair cartel, Dost thou, lady, to this reservation give thy mind? Or what is thy sovereign pleasure to this import?" Miss N.--"tHad I the words of fate to dispense withal, I could not improve thy happy conceit. Be it as thou hast fashioned it, and not a line be rased or added. Let it stand as a monument to our affection till with a gentle noise the heavens do pass away, and that for each other we do W  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7248-00000107"/> 21:2      WILKINS WYDER; ORB, live in sweetest constancy, awaiting the reward of con- jugal life, unless either of us our mind should change, and prefer some other person. In that extremity, our compact will have its true exposition and fulfilment." As the young lady concluded her reply, a large passenger- boat was seen coming up the river, meeting the -Monarch. The promenade was suspended, and all the ladies and gen- tlemen stood in pairs, watching the boat pass. Our readers have been informed of the sailor-costume which Mr. Ogilby still retained for the solitary reason that he had no other. With Miss Nicholson on;his arm, they stood gazing at the Sultana as she proudly dashed by the Monarch. There was a great display .of passengers on both boats, as usual on such occasions, and there was a general waving of hats and handkerchiefs. A number of voices from the Sultana cried out, "Three cheers for Red Jacket!" thus designating Mr. Ogilby as a mark among fashionably-dressed passen- gers. This gentleman thus softly responded to the com- pliment:-- "Shame on the dim-sighted world, That no deeper sees than the outside look! These people on the Sultana's deck, Foolish, and proud of their own gay attire, Unjustly cast derision on the humbly clad, As if staple of cotton, flax, and silk possessed A More worth than mind, without which Those staples would be of no avail in commerce, Nor source of comfort to their owners. Like the Jews of old, who swore by the gift, And yet held void that which sanctified The gift, revering the less as supreme, So, fair lady, with poor selfish man: No faculties has he perfection to discern In his fellows; he cannot judge aright,- Always passing judgment, and in error always. From this example let us wisdom draw. *    THE SUCCESSPUL MAN.      213 Those pompous, silly banterers of 'Red Jacket,' As me they called in sport, Would feel dismayed to learn the truth, That you and other ladies of noble means Had disregarded the texture of my apparel, And took my mind and culture into view, My practised manners and converse gay. These surface-men, who judge thus wrong, Would cheaply feel to know the tribute Paid me by their superiors, first of all by you. And now, fair lady, let me advise, Whene'er your toiling sex you behold In street or dwelling with menial office taxed, Do not their lot despise, nor yet their persons. Had to them fortune been kind as to you, they might In very truth have adorned your place as well. From my soul, all pretension I do hate, All airs of self-love, and tricks of vanity. In my imagination, you despise such breeding, Such violence to nature and all propriety. But my lecture I must forthwith terminate, As I hear the bell calling us to lunch. Your hand, fair lady, and down these steps." Among the passengers was a distinguished clergyman, the Rev. Adam Goodson, of Louisville. He had listened in great kindness, and often with a smile, to the off-hand compositions of Mr. Ogilby. Finding the latter reading in the social hall in the afternoon, Mr. Goodson took a seat by him, and began a friendly conversation, expressing warm interest in his welfare and admiration of his talents. He informed Mr. Ogilby that what had taken place within the last twenty-four hours, from the time Mr. Wylder an- nounced himself to the collegians who were serving in the humblest capacity on the boat, was more like romance than any thing he had ever before met with in life. And he was particularly delighted with the fine scholarship  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7248-00000108"/> 214       WILKINS WYDER; OR, and conversational ability of Mr. Ogilby, who had taken all minds captive, not omitting the ladies. If it would not be disagreeable, Mr. Goodson said, he would like to have- some passing words with him, which might relate to literature, perhaps, as well as other matters. Mr. Goodson then gave it as his judgment that so much cultivation, such felicitous phraseology, and such inex- haustible resources of taste, ought to be turned to the very best account: they were gifts which imposed on the possessor the obligation to use them for the good of his race. If Mr. Ogilby would apply his mind to theology, and, by the blessing of Heaven, become a minister of the gospel, what wonderful effects he might produce by his Miltonic style and his brilliant elocution! Mr. Goodson then inquired of him whether he had been raised in a religious manner, and if he ever had serious thoughts on a future state. Ogilby.--"Whate'er his destiny, high or low, No man, on earth may trifle with his Creator. My infant lips were taught to pray, As, bending o'er my couch, a pious mother Repeated nightly, 'Now I lay me down to sleep.' And when I larger grew, the Lord's Prayer' Vas my morning and my evening task: While in her closet my mother often kneeled, With me at her side, her hand upon my head, Something she said which I did not understand: It was earnest supplication, with hands uplifted; Her husband, children, and servants were in the prayer, But in what relation my memory does not serve. To church she often led me, and I sat demure, Or, kneeling by her side, I heard her whisper Softly, as if an ear was present to catch the sounds. Sometimes her face was bright, her eyes were wet, When she arose, stooped down and kissed me. She told me that to God in heaven her prayer arose; j   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       215 But I supposed that God was in the church, Comforting my mother, and the preacher too,- Good Mr. Gairrard, who is now in heaven. "At length my mother also died, Has gone the preacher in the skies to join, And I am desolate, a withered branch, Ready to perish for want of nurture. Dear mother, that dying look, the blessing Thou didst give, lingers with me still, Arid oft from ruin hath saved my life. Still I am rebellious, foolish, and unstable, In duty hard to be instructed plain. I seek a sign like that to Saul of Tarsus, When a light surpassing mid-day crossed his path, And, dazzling, his eyes did blind: Then he prayed--'twas his first Christian prayer. Paul, glori6us martyr! thy good fight is o'er, And thy record doth millions guide to heaven, Where the ransomed sons of men. shall see thee. I am no blasphemer, no outlaw vile, No moral pestilence to taint my kind; But I am thoughtless, to pleasures gay inclined, To excess of youth, and buoyant hopes. I shall to my father's house repair, And tell him all,--how I have sinned; Perhaps he may the robe put on, and Press me to his bosom,-his lost and found. "And now, kind sir, my thanks -Thou hast, thanks sincere, for thy tender words. My soul by loving sympathy thou hast touched, And to my latest hour I'll bless thy name. I do intend reform, and soon to begin, When back- to college I shall be received. The President, my reverend friend, will forgive, When- true repentance- he shall see: Of my wandering history he shall be informed,  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7248-00000109"/> 216       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Even of this occasion with thee discoursing. By man forgiven and restored to favor, I shall then seek pardon from on high; And let duty call in whate'er direction, If I am a Christian true, I shall obey, And thus may you and I in heaven meet, Though on earth our companionship May ne'er again be cast. Farewell!" During these remarks, Mr. Goodson was greatly affected: toward the close he shed tears freely. Grasping Mr. Ogilby's hand, he pressed it affectionately, and withdrew to his state-room. A number of persons were present, including Captain Longcope and Messrs. Parke and Har- dison. - The two latter evinced a good deal of emotion as their comrade ceased speaking. Splendid as they knew his talents to be, they had never seen him so grand and solemn in any of his moods. In one corner sat a man, looking on with a kind of sneer at what was passing between Mr. Goodson and Mr. Ogilby. Soon after Mr. Goodson had retired from the company, this individual in the corner, who was known to be as gambler going up and down the river after his prey, addressed himself to Mr. Ogilby with a sort of reckless familiarity, and said, "The parson came near getting you this time. I am afraid I shall not have the pleasure of your company at the exhibition in New Orleans, to which I was anxious to introduce you, that you might avenge yourself for former injuries in the way of golden eagles. The tiger has a strong box in the city; and you are welcome to your share." Mr. Ogilby rose from his seat, and, casting a look of the most withering contempt on the gambler, thus addressed him:- "Reptile, how darest thou to speak  By what license is thy cloven tongue permitted To hiss out sounds among honest men?   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       217 Back to thy hiding-place, thou brainless demon, Thou mortgaged plunder of the infernal regions! I see thy putrid carcass belted with dirks, And pistols, and savage knives, -To kill those whom thou canst not rob at cards, Or who may offend thy Satanic highness! I fear thee not, thou butcher and ingrate, Thou stalking pestilence and moral death. Thy class I know too well: you lie in wait To catch the artless, and then you strike With more fatal venom than the rattlesnake, Whose inferior in moral wealth I pronounce you; For his rattled kingship gives warning Of his fangs, and notifies of danger. But you, vile robber, no such magnanimity Your victims show; you decoy, and drug, And purses take without even the ceremony Of a game; and watches you also grab, And strip your confiding, senseless dupes Of all their clothing, and wholly destitute Cast them into the street --this you do, And such feats plan and execute With as much delight as you take, daily food. By your hellish clan I have suffered; your ways Are to me known by sad experience. If in perdition there be a hotter place Than all the rest, thou, base gambler, wilt be there. Hateful as thou art, I would adjure thee, Before thy fate is sealed in death, Thy infernal box, and all thy cards and tricks, With secret springs and devices hidden, To cast into this boiling flood, and then reform. Thy action the applause of honest men will gain, And for respectability thou wilt have a chance. Rather fireman be, cook, or knife-grinder, Saw wood, drive oxen, or do any thing 19  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7248-00000110"/> 218       WTLKTNS WYDER; OR, That's honest, rather than be a gambler. Thy excess of degradation doth pity wake And my forbearance doth engender. "With heartless sneer thou didst provoke My indignation, when rudely the preacher -Thou didst mention, and his noble cause. Above thy malice he is far exalted. And I, too, leaning on his holy staff, Did for consolation ask by simple words, Like a little child for bread looking up Into its father's or its mother's face. And for this respect to piety shown, Thy dog-tail tongue thou didst wag In mockery of what alone can save thee. To cast thee overboard I will not insist, Though a blessing to the world 'twould prove; But I will leave thee to ponder on thy steps, As inch by inch they hasten thee to hell. When thou art there arrived,-a pit Of deepest fire, blue with brimstone blaze, Shall thee engulf, and howling loud Shall thy employment be through vast eternity. And-yet, thou miserable wretch, if I could, I would not send thee to such quarters, To join the victims thou hast destroyed. But rather would I forgive thee all, As myself I hope to be forgiven By that Father of us all who hears The cry of penitence and the wail of sorrow, Never to Him addressed in vain. And now, poor, degraded gambler, Whilst thy calling I despise, thee I pity, And all deluded men who roam, Like thee, to cheat, plunder and deprave. My leave of thee I take forever!"' (,    THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       219 It would occupy too much space to follow up the curious exhibitions of sentiment and fancy duringthe voyage to New Orleans, and while the parties halted there to equip them- selves in fine suits of clothing as elegant gentlemen. Many occurrences called forth the poetic effusions of Mr. Ogilby, which it would take a volume to describe. Mr. CWylder and his travelling companions, Messrs. Ogilby, Parke, and Har- dison, in due time arrived at Wylder Hall, where they experienced a cordial reception. CFTAPTER XXVI. DR. WYDER and all the members of his family were glad to see Wilkins so much improved in health by his Western tour. In his own estimation, no chapter in his life had' been so replete with interest as his late journey, by enabling him  to restore to their friends the three drowned collegians. Before those gentlemen descended from their rooms the morning after their arrival, Wilkins told his parents what sort of a genius one of them was, and that when Mr. Ogilby came into the parlor a few words addressed to him would suffice to bring out his great faculty of extemporizing blank verse,-that he was a young man of rare gifts and high personal honor, though he had been led off by his follies on a wild-goose chase, which he might possibly describe on the introduction, and that he was altogether courteous under his eccentricities. It was not long before the collegians came into the re- ception-room, and Wilkins gave each of them an introduc. tion to his parents. After they were seated, Dr. Wylder expressed his fear that the late hour of arrival last night had been unfavorable to Mr. Ogilby's repose, and inquired whether the hours had passed agreeably. Ogilby.-"Never has time more fleeting been, Or of happiness more productive,  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7248-00000111"/> 220       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Than since admission to your roof I gained. . From journey long and tiresome just arrived, With my guardian friend, your noble son, I laid me down and soundly slept. Delightful was the couch, and dreams Of happy childhood filled my weary mind. My father, bent with age, methought I saw, Weeping for his Benjamin, my truant self. Radiant with love, his features did expand Until in my vision they did reach the sky. More friendly gleamed the stars, and brighter Than I had seen the moon, pale Luna smiled, As if to cheer me with her heavenly light. The glittering dome above, the azure hue Of the great canopy, the fields of ether, All around me hung as curtains to my soul. These I did see, and was sore amazed That such vast possessions my father owned, And from my eyes concealed had been. Oft of titles he had spoken, deeds to land, To acres broad, field and forest wide; But ne'er till now did I discover  i What inheritance he had in store for me. Methought my loving brother and my sisters two And I together on our wealth were gazing, In happy consultation to locate our shares. My brother, eldest born, with right of choice, The North-star took as centre of his claim. Tomy sisters, though younger, I did defer, And besought them next to choose. Fair Rosa the South preferred, and gave To little Cora betweien East and West For her possession: to the former she did point, And left me the West for my sole dominion. Then my estate to view I forthwith sped On wings of steam, and stood upon the spot.-   THE SUCCESSFUL IMAN.      221 Around me fierce tigers howled, and wolves Of prey and vampires huge my vision dimmed By reason of their multitude, and I did faint. Then a serpent vile and large did coil His spotted form around my neck, And did crush me in his folds. Gasping for breath, I struggled long And hard, expecting every moment My last would be, when, lo, an angel To my relief appeared, and broke the spell. Such my estate in the West has proved, Tigers, wolves, and serpents in human shape, And your noble son has my deliverer been. Then in joy I awoke, and here with you, My father's friend, I am most content. In the West the painful dream was mine; With you, the happy termination. So may it augur that faces kind And hearts of love my return await. For your friendly inquisition I thank you, sir: Most refreshing slumber last night did H enjoy." Dr. Wylder and his lady were quite delighted with their poetic guest, whose manners were agreeable, and whose face was lighted up by the fires of genius. The other two young gentlemen, Messrs. Parke and Hardison, were also treated with marked complaisance. They spent a week at Wylder Hall, sometimes following the hounds in the chase, and then joining pleasant fishing-excursions which were proposed, for their amusement. Dr. Wylder requested his guests to feel perfectly at home, and to be in no hurry to depart. He understood all, and knew what allowance to make for the indiscretions of young men. Any assistance he could render- he assured them, was entirely at their command. In the mean time, Mr. Ogilby had written from Wylder Hall to his bosom friend and classmate, Bryan Mosely, 19.  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7248-00000112"/> 222       WILKINS WYDER; oR, stating the resurrection of the drowned collegians, which was to be kept a profound secret until a ghost-scene should be enacted in the hall of the Eureka Society, to which Ogilby belonged. The programme directed that Mosely should notify his friend at Wylder Hall of a regular meeting of the society, at which he was to make a pathetic allusion to Ogilby as one of their chief lights extinguished, and was to invoke his spirit as if it was hovering over the members. Just then Ogilby was to appear, wrapped in a sheet, and his face powdered white to resemble a ghost. The shadow was to behave with all solemnity, and make an address in a sepulchral voice, in the course of which he was to call up the spirits of his two companions, and they also were to appear. It was imagined that such a display of the supernatural would produce quite a sensation in the society, and might lead to fainting or similar consequences, perhaps to some little expedition in retiring through the windows or side doors of the hall, all of which would be vastly amusing to those in the secret. Time was to be allowed the drowned men to make the journey in disguise, with false whiskers and false hair, and otherwise changed for the occasion so as not to be recognised by any of their friends except Mosely, who was to conduct them in the dark to a room opening into the hall. There the ghostly habiliments were to be put on, and the scene to originate. This was the plan communicated by Ogilby to Mosely. , The answer was all that the former could desire to carry out his plan, and a time was appointed for the proceedings. Mr. Wylder saw that his young friends were in high spirits, which he attributed to pleasant news they had received from home, in relation to which, however, he asked no questions. An early day was fixed for their departure, and, as the time approached, traces of melan- choly were for the first time seen in their countenances. They took Mr. Wylder aside, and confessed their obliga- tions for the generous. part he' bad acted toward them, H,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       223 which they should always hold in-grateful remembrance. They requested that he would inform them the amount he had advanced for each, as he should receive checks im- mediately after their return home. Mr. Wylder assured them that he was their debtor, as their company, and the circumstances which had transpired from the hour he first saw Mr. Parke at the furnace of the lMonarch on the Ohio, -to the present time, had been to him a source of great enjoyment. Indeed, he should always look upon the acquaintance he had formed with them as one of the most agreeable passages in his experience. He advised them, in the most friendly manner, to make peace with the college authorities on the best terms, taking all the blame on themselves, and promising due behavior in all the future, which promise he hoped they would observe in good faith. Their natural capacities, he informed them, were such as to insure great distinction in the world; and he should expect to hear a good report when they took the respon- sibilities of citizens after leaving college. At all events, they had his sincere wishes- for their success. They promised an entire change in their conduct, and that they would endeavor to prove themselves worthy of his friendship, and of the warm interest he had taken in their welfare. The parting at Wylder Hall was a touching scene. Dr. Wylder and his lady had read in the papers more than six months before of the death of the three college students by the upsetting of a boat, and the great distress it had occasioned their families. They had sympathized in the calamity, and now; under circumstances almost incredible, these very students were enjoying their hospitality on their way to their bereaved friends,--the dead restored to life! By their intelligent conversation and gentlemanly address, the young men had gained the esteem of Dr. Wylder and his family. The mail-coach drove up to Wylder Hall, the baggage was sent out, kind invitations  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7248-00000113"/> 224       WILKINS WYDER; OR, and adieus were exchanged, and the three collegians were borne off from their entertainers. Late in the afternoon of the succeeding day, the coach stopped at the hotel nearest the college, where our young gentlemen registered the names they answered to on the Mississippi. A note was immediately sent to Mosely, who lost no time in joining his deceased friends at the hotel. He found them together in a private room, where he em- braced each affectionately, and welcomed them back from the tomb, and said that all things were ready for the formal resurrection that night. He promised that he would call for them soon after supper, and conduct them to a room which opened into the society's hall, where they might prepare their 'winding' sheets and ghostly faces for the invocation which he should make, accompanied by a loud rap of his knuckles on the desk, which was to be the signal for the apparition No. 1 to show itself. Although the landlord and fifty persons at his table knew Ogilby, Parke, and Hardison previous to their death, not one of them recognised their representatives, -who were soon to create a mighty uproar in the town. They had artificial hair and beards well calculated to escape de- tection. When the proper time arrived, Mosely called 4t the hotel, and in the darkness had no difficulty in reaching the chamber prepared for the evening's entertainment. There were two doors to the room, one opening at the head of the staircase, and the other into the hall where the Society held its meetings; to both of which doors Mosely had obtained the keys, and the ghosts locked them- selves up. The members of the Society had invited several of the most literary citizens to be present on the occasion, as a, very interesting debate was to come off, on the question, ", Is death an enemy?"The President of the Society, Ralph Jenkins, took his seat, and called the society to order, when the Secretary, Hugh Dalton, stated the question, and the names  .    .   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      225 of the three speakers on each side. For the affirmative was the name of Bryan Mosely, fifth in the order of dis- cussion. Charles Hatch opened the debate in handsome style, supporting the affirmative. He was replied to by Dudley Spain in favor of the negative, who maintained that "age had its infirmities and its pains, which would drive the sufferers to despair, were they not relieved by the friendly hand of death, and a new world of felicity opened for their enjoyment, where youth eternal flourished in all the vigor of the mountain-laurel." Thus far the balances were about equal, until Rittenhouse Smiley gave death a severe rip by declaring that "neither the innocence of childhood, nor the beauty of the maiden, nor thes vigor of manhood, nor the gravity of age, could escape the ruthless invader alike of the palace and the cottage,-inexorable death, remorseless foe of man." Per- ceiving that his friend Death was roughly handled, Lorenzo Birdsong came to his relief, and in dulcet tones of elo- quence vindicated his behavior, thus:--"If men were im- mortal on earth, where could space be found for their habitations and support? Were the boundless ocean turned into dry land, and the globe laid off into equal shares to accommodate all who have existed from Adam to the pre- sent time, there would not be room enough to contain them, standing side by side, even though packed together by the compression of steam. All can at once perceive the inconvenience of such a crowded population; and we may thank death for the abundant room we all have to work and travel at pleasure." Had the vote been taken at the conclusion of this- speech, it is quite probable that the negative would have prevailed, -that death was justified in his mysterious doings. X But at this juncture Bryan Mosely brandished, his sword, and the grim spectre received a few skilful thrusts,--such, for example, as, "Not only the :heart of parents, but that of the country itself, is torn by* bereavement at the fall of P  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7248-00000114"/> 226       WILKINS WYDER; OR, genius by the icy touch of death,-insaiate monster! The tears of grief have scarcely dried upon our cheeks for the loss of three dear companions, who in all the pride of health and promise met a watery grave. 'Who but an enemy relentless as death could have inflicted such mourning and anguish on our community? But for this destroyer of the dearest hopes of man, we should have- listened to-night to the eloquent voice of OGILBY, who with the genius of Shakspeare and the fire of Milton would have given sublimity to this discussion. His spark- ling eye and noble form, the very embodiment of youthful greatness, would have been in our midst, pleading the cause of humanity against the ravages of death. Poor, gifted youth! He was my dearest friend, my classmate and room-companion. His image is enshrined within my heart, to abide there forever! iHe was removed from us by death, and thrice our peace was slain; for with him perished in the angry flood two other young friends, to rise no more until the final resurrection-morning. Sometimes I see Ogilby in my dreams, as I have often beheld him in this hall, with tragic attitude and splendid diction, enchanting us by his miracles of speech. If the spirits of loved ones can wander back to earth, methinks that Ogilby is watch- ing over our deliberations to-night. Noble youth and best of friends, look down from thy home above and deign to cheer us by thy sympathies!" Here a sepulchral groan was heard in the adjoining room, and the door instantly opened, and in stalked a figure of unearthly appearance, clad in a shroud, with face cadaverous and frightful. It slowly advanced toward Mosely, who retreated a few paces in great agitation. The president's hair stood on end, and all the members gazed upon the figure, but were unable to stir from their seats. They looked almost as pale as the ghostly intruder, and the hair of each bristled up in imitation of the presiding officer. The figure cast its eyes mournfully over the crowd,   THE SUCoESSFUL MAN.       227 and, with uplifted hand, thus spoke, in deep, solemn tones:- "Thou knowest me not, dear friends; Once in flesh and blood like you I dwelt, And in this hall did often speak. But now another country I inhabit, A middle place 'twixt hell and heaven, Where my polluted soul doth shelter find, Until by penance and charitable offerings From purgatory sombre I am relieved. In my abode of twilight, trembling Between day and night, obscure to hide The landscape and the forms thereof, My hours in secluded hope I pass. Friends known to me have I there,- Those precious twO who were with me lost In the turbid waves of Olosko's stream. To night have I come to gaze once more On brothers, scenes and comrades dear. And not alone am I from the spirit-world; To bear me company, Parke and Hardison My incantation do now await. Loving partners, hear this rap, And to my presence quick repair." The door instantly swung back, and two other figures in white came slowly forward. The chief of the ghosts de- manded of his two associates,- "Grieved or satisfied art thou In the spirit-land where thou dost sojourn? If now thy souls it will delight To linger as of yore around these halls, Then fulfilment I do grant to thy desire. If to thy-friends and college mates Thou wilt be restored, raise thy hands. [They comply.] {'Friends, citizens, president, secretary,  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7248-00000115"/> 228       WILXINS -WYwLjE);?OR, /  Speakers, collectively, one and all, To thee I do introduce these truant boys, Parke and Tardison, who to life have-come, And on this earth, like me, do seek a home.

At this juncture, all three of the ghosts cast off their white wrappers and hoods and appeared in proper dress. Retaining their places still, Mosely acted as master of ceremonies, and said,' "Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to introduce our friends, the veritable Ogilby, Parke, and Hardison, who have been - long mourned as dead.  I take upon myself the credit of second in this exciting scene to-night, Mr. Ogilby having notified me a few days ago of his return from the West in company with the Honorable Mr. Wylder, member of Congress elect from the fourth district. And now, as a suitable conclusion of our meeting, Il move that the resolutions deploring the death of;^our three college companions be rescinded on the minutes, and that the secretary refuse these gentlemen permission to see in what terms we honored their memo- ries. And long may they live to deserve well of their country!"  -   ^  The motion to rescind was unanimously adopted, and a scene of congratulation ensued of the most agreeable cha- racter. Many tears were shed and embraces given on the occasion of receiving the dead back to life. . It was a grand comedy, somewhat terrific at the beginning; but it closed with more than the usual stage felicities of representation. The news spread over town as the -stdents a0nd visitors   T HE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       229 returned from the hall to their respective homes. The story was almost incredible. Next day, Messrs. Ogilby, Parke, and Hardison sent a message to the faculty, asking permission to come before them to pay their respects and to explain their conduct. The reply was in the kindest spirit. An interview took place, and the absentees were restored to their classes, on condition that by extra dili- gence in their studies they would make up for lost time. After paying a 'short visit to their relations, which it is unnecessary to describe, these Mississippi-boat characters were again students of the university, with a bright future before them. As these gentlemen may not again figure in this history, it is proper to state that checks were promptly forwarded to Mr. Wylder for the money he had advanced in their behalf. In due time they all graduated with conspicuous credit, Ogilby taking the first honor. In a few years thereafter he married the great belle Miss Sallie Howard, whose death in less than eighteen months undermined his spirits so that he did not long survive her. Many who read this story will at once recognise the original. He was a singular genius, eminently dramatic, and in the Thespian performances of the students he was the ac- knowledged king of the boards. It was surmised by those who saw him after marriage that domestic life, however enchanting the ties which ought to have rendered him happy, was not the element in which his soul could find repose. He possessed rare gifts, which proved an injury instead of a blessing; and it was perhaps fortunate that he died early, as he was thus saved from many sharp stings and miseries which never fail to pursue men of strong imagination and acute sensibilites, such as Ogilby possessed. The other two gentlemen bhad different fortunes,-one ad- verse and the other prosperous; and, as they are still living, it would be indelicate to say more about them.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7248-00000116"/> 230       WILKINS WYDER; OR,- CHAPTER XXVII. THE time at length arrived for Mr. Wylder to repair to the Federal city on the meeting of Congress. His father took occasion to remind him of the necessity of constant vigilance in order to accomplish the great aim of life. Thus far he had succeeded well. On all occasions he had proved himself firm, bold, and independent in the line of duty. While serving in the State Legislature, he had left the impress of his mind, not soon to be forgotten by a grate- ful constituency. In all trusts committed to him, public or private, he had acted with fidelity. There was much cause to hope that he would go on, step by step, until he had established a reputation for ability and patriotism which might be worthy of -the notice of history. Life was but a poor privilege unless we could do something to improve society, or in some way contribute to the happiness of our fellows, which would entitle our memories to friendly pre- servation. Dr. Wylder adverted to the plan of his son's education, how thorough it had been, and with what ele- vated views his tutor had impressed his mind. The field for their mature display was now before him. In his twenty-seventh year, possessing an easy fortune, good health, and an unblemished napne, his prospect was cer- tainly gratifying; and he expected much from his Congres- sional career. The first session would continue probably about six months, in which time he would become ac- quainted with the course of public business, so as to feel at ease in committee or on the floor. That he would bear himself honorably, he had not the least doubt. With such paternal advice, Mr. Wylder felt himself f ,' *   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       281 strengthened for his new position. He proceeded to Wash- ington, and assisted by his vote in electing the Speaker. and the other officers of the House of Representatives on the first day of the session. It so happened that he was placed on the House 'committee to join that of the Senate to inform the President that the two Houses of Congress were organized and ready to receive any com. munication he might have to lay before them. The joint committee took carriages and waited on the President at the Executive mansion, or White House, as it is generally called. The Hon. William  R. King, of the South, acted as chairman, who introduced each member of the com- mittee to the President. The ceremony was conducted in good taste, and gave Mr. Wylder his first experience in official etiquette. After being informed by the President that he would transmit his annual communication the next day at meridian, the committee withdrew and reported to their respective Houses. Thus ended the first day in Congress, and Mr. Wylder congratulated himself on his good fortune. In a few days the Speaker announced the standing com- mittees of the House. Mr. Wylder's name was third on the Committee of Ways. and Means,-which was quite com- plimentary to a new member. He made acquaintances with ease; and it was not many weeks before he had exchanged personal courtesies with all the principal mem- bers of the House. From his childhood he had heard much of John Quincy Adams, who was a Representative from Massachusetts after having been President of the United States. He found this venerable man laborious and atten- tive in the discharge of his public duties,--a fit example to all who desired to serve the country to advantage. But there was something in the- manner of Mr. Adams which was at times disagreeable, and inconsistent with the ideas Mr. Wylder had formed of the lersonal bearing of a gentleman who had enjoyed the first honors of the  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7248-00000117"/> 232       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Republic,-of a man who held a high diplomatic station under the first President,--who had filled more important offices and had been longer in service than any other citizen of the country. Instead of that serene and lofty bearing which he had expected from a statesman so learned and experienced, Mr. Wylder found Mr. Adams was often petulant in debate and at times indulged a degree of acrimony which mortified the admirers of his fame. But in other respects Mr. Adams did not disappoint him. His information seemed to be universal and most accurate; and, when not betrayed by his passions into rash remarks, he was heard with great deference by all the members of the. House. The infirmities of Mr. Adams's temper gave rise to disagreeable thoughts in the mind of Mr. Wylder with regard to the emptiness of fame and the vanity of life. As the session progressed, various measures were intro- duced, many of them referred to committees, and sometimes a very elaborate report was made, and a large number ordered to be printed for distribution throughout the country. The reports of the Departments and of the different Bureaus were quite voluminous, and accompanied by tables and a variety of explanations, all forming several thousand pages of printed matter. These were also dis- tributed among the people in the form of:public documents, at a great expense to the treasury. Mr. Wylder made it a rule to vote for the largest number, thereby placing before the reading-classes a detailed view of general affairs, and the annual cost of the different branches of the public service, which, since the time Mr. Adams was President, had risen from thirteen to fifty millions of dollars. Mr. Wylder soon ascertained that there was no scale of justice by which the real minds that worked for the country could receive due acknowledgment from the public. For instance, a call would be made by the House on one of the Departments for information relative to commerce or of foreign intercourse. Whatever the object, or how-   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       283 ever complicated, the subordinates of the Secretary would be set to work compiling the tables, and digesting in a skilful manner allthe information sought, with explanatory notes evincing great research, the whole perhaps forming a printed volume of five hundred pages or more, the manuscript of which would be -communicated to the House in a half-dozen lines by the Secretary of State, or other head of Department, who would receive all the credit. Mr. Wylder saw enough of this kind of management to con- vince him that men often gained high reputation without deserving it; and yet there was no way of acting other- wise. There had to be hundreds of clerks, patient and hiborious in their sphere, to prepare thesq details on which the Secretaries rest their conclusions and their fame. It was impossible to render justice to the subordinates withoutT' detracting from the dignity and importance of their chief; and this fact caused a train of reflections in Mr. Wylder's mind early in his Congressional career. He thus revolved the matter within himself:- "I was taught by my1preceptor and by my parents to love the truth and to abide by it at all hazards. .Truth was right, and nothing but truth could be right: it was the foundation of all honor and justice. This theory no man may dispute; it is the very transcript of the divine will. Can it be carried out in the affairs of government? ,Can we render justice and honor. where due, without respect of persons? I would be thankful for a plan to secure this result. Am I able to devise one? Shall I move in- the House to have a Government Directory printed, which shall set forth, under suitable heads, every name from the President down to the lowest employee who aids in the execution of the laws, with an outline of the labors of each?  This would be a Dictionary of Office-Holders, larger in bulk than Webster's quarto of the English lan- guage; but what a magazine of facts for the country! The plan might resemble this specimen :-. 2-*  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7248-00000118"/> 234       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Allsop, Richard, Consul to Greece, 1789 to 1800, received $15,000.

Similar remarks might accompany each name in the work, as the facts au- thorized, the whole forming a dictionary that would throw Bayle and Lempriere completely in the shade. These men-say half a million, more or less-would live in print, just as members of Congress are kept in remembrance by the ayes and noes on the Journal, the largest portion of them never rising above that opportunity for fame. A Government Dictionary is a bright conception; and, though it may not- be advisable to propose the measure to Con- gress, I am disposed to think that some patient and labo. rious compiler, who loves to arrange scattered items under specific titles just for the luxury of classification, will pre- pare such a work, and urge on Congress the necessity of purchasing the copyright, or, at least, of paying the author  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7248-00000119"/> 236       WILKINS WYDER; OR, handsomely for his trouble. Is there no equity in such a publication? Why should not all public servants be en- titled to equal praise and commendation? By what pre- rogative in nature do a few selfish men monopolize history, while the great number who bore the heat and burden of the i  day are excluded from the record? Such discrimination would be just, had not the sanctuary of fame been invaded by rash adventurers, by men destitute of cultivation, virtue or public spirit, who wildly scramble each to write his name with charcoal highest on the inner-walls of the temple in which WASHNGTON is enshrined. There was a time when poverty was no disgrace, if coupled with forti- tude, patriotism, and intelligence such as we read of among the ancient worthies. To prevent the grosser element from corroding the pure, and thus debasing man, a law was /    enacted by the Senate of Rome that no citizen should possess more than a certain amount of property, which was quite a small sum compared to modern fortunes. In- dividual prosperity was looked upon with disfavor by the ancients, when men were deified for their lofty qualities. Now they are worshipped for their wealth, regardless of morality in its attainment. "Since this perversion has obtained," thought Mr Wylder, "and there is no possibility of establishing a higher stand-- ard among the American people, it is expedient for every man to profit in his way. It is a great sacrifice of convic- tion and taste on my part to engage in this sordid, unmanly warfare; but there is no escaping from it, except to hide ourselves in caves and solitudes like so many foolish hermits. My education has been wrong. I was taught what duty was in the abstract,--a positive obligation. No- where do Hfind corresponding sentiments,-either in' Con- gress or out of it. I am like a shipmaster who has taken a cargo of oranges to a port where the inhabitants live on fish-oil and reject all vegetable nutriment. My cargo of principles is in no demand here; but still the laws of trade   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       237 drive me into the market, and I must speculate, as others do, on the chances which come in the way. Beloved tutor, how I once revered thy wisdom and walked after thy pure example! Thy lessons have all to be forgotten, and a new stock of knowledge and new principles, suited to actual life, must be acquired before I can be successful in my aims. Whilst I deplore the necessity, I yield to the current, and must sink or swim as fate may decree. My old-fashioned ideas of propriety must be cast aside, and the modern im- provements adopted in their place. If my integrity shall remain, I hope to navigate through the storm into the haven of peace at last. There, recounting my. perils and thankful for deliverance, I shall be better instructed on the voyage from time to eternity. "The President, the heads of Department, the Senators and Representatives, the judges of the Supreme Court, the chiefs of the army and navy, and others high sounding in position, are all mere figures on the stage, speaking in arti- ficial tones, and are nothing but ordinary men at last, in spite of their trappings and parade. I speak compara- tively, on my ideal standard. Not one of all the official array at Washington can afford to be natural, except the representatives of foreign courts. These have no favors to ask, and by their contemptuous self-possession give us to understand that for any indignity offered them the Powers at their back will demand redress. I have no such influence to keep me erect and calm; but I will honestly accommodate myself to the truth as I find it exemplified in action, not as in the beauty of repose. If I become un- happy, and my hopes prove a failure after my best exer- tions, I shall have no cause of self-reproach." The shock of disappointment which his feelings encoun- tered in Congress drove Mr Wylder to society for relief, and he relaxed his attention to public business in order to give himself a new scope for enjoyment.  Thus far he had never cultivated with any special design the favor of the  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7248-00000120"/> 238     , WILKINS WY!ER; OR, ladies, though he had ever been partial to their society and had never failed to make himself agreeable. His mind had been absoribed in the pursuit of fame, and he -had finally reached the object of his ambition,-a seat in Con- gress. As already shown, the prize withered in his grasp, and instead of a beautiful gem, bright with the colors of poetry, he found it a crude, misshapen pebble, unworthy of his solicittide. His reflections had taken a new channel. Though he did not regret his peculiar ideas, derived from the books which had been placed in his hands by his tutor, he was convincedbf their inapplicability to the great pur- poses of life, and therefore it was the part of wisdom to modify or change them as circumstances dictated. He compared his deficiencies in the actual with the tact and success with which others, who had no ideal perfection, seized on passing events and made&amp; them subservient to their purposes. He communed with himself long and earnestly to find the proper line of action. One of the lessons of his youth had been that the influence exerted on the mind by the society of ladies was calculated to re- fine the manners and improve the heart. Mr. Wylder resolved on the experiment, and accepted the many invita- tions he received to dine with resident families, and also with those of members of Congress. As a recompense for his former chagrin and disappointment, a new life was now opened- to him, which as far exceeded his anticipations as Congress had fallen below them. He had been of opinion that he had seen as beautiful and as intellectual -women in. the South as the world could produce; but the fashionable circles at Washington were something more. Not only were their charms of person and of mind equal to any he could imagine, but the elegant self-control and winning ways of the young ladies at once commanded him to sur- render. Here was a handsome gentleman, only twenty-seven years of age, highly educated, occupying an honorable   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       239 public trust, and the possessor of wealth, who had never acknowledged the sovereignty of Cupid or been wounded by his mischievous archery. Mr. Wylder experienced new emotions, and congratulated himself that he had at last discovered the secret of happiness. Many of the intervals afforded by the daily adjournments of the House were passed among the ladies, with whom his acquaintance gra- dually enlarged, and in the same ratio became more agree- able. Out of the brilliant number within the range of his accustomed visits, it was natural to suppose that he could select one to whom he would apply all his arts of pleasing. How he proceeded, and with what success, will appear in the next chapter. CHAPTER XXVIII. BEFORE proceeding further, it is relevant to say that each successive winter brings together at Washington, from various parts of the Union, a large number of ladies, married and single, whose attractions add much to the enlightened society of the metropolis. Senators and Re- presentatives in Congress from the East and West, North and South, generally take their families with them)--espe- cially during the long session. Besides their own daugh- ters, they are sometimes accompanied by sisters and nieces, and often by the daughters of some relative or friend, to be introduced into the circles which fashion has made the most dazzling on the American continent. Here magnificent entertainments are given, from the President and his Cabinet ministers down to private life, where there is often displayed more than official grandeur. And it is considered a laudable task for all who choose to bring about tender relations, to exert the skill most likely to succeed. Hence special occasions are invented to throw  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7248-00000121"/> 240--      WILKINS WYDER; OR, particular gentlemen and ladies who are on the marrying list in situations to provoke a committal. Indeed, such contrivances are- highly beneficial, as many a hundred couple can testify who might not otherwise have become acquainted with each other. Matrimonial negotiations'at the seat of Government are usually conducted with as much formality as the- Secretary of State and the foreign diplomatists who reside there prepare their despatches which affect the peace of the world. It was not necessary, perhaps, that efforts should have been used to draw Mr. Wylder within the enchanted sphere; nor is it pretended that he became a victim to any such conspiracy. At all events, before the session was two-thirds advanced, this worthy gentleman was paying marked attention -to the beautiful Miss Maria Chilton, of Virginia, who had been several years prominent among the belles at Washington. This lady was in her twenty-second year, tall, and gracefully formed, and of fair complexion, with blue eyes and brown hair, the latter flowing down her shoulders in most bewitching ringlets. Her father had been dead some ten years, leaving quite a large property to be divided between four children, of whom she was the second, the eldest being Lieutenant Decatur Chilton, of the Navy. Next in age to her was her brother, James Chilton, who was then attending a course of medical lectures in Philadelphia; and the youngest was her sister Josephine, who was at a boarding-school in New Jersey. Her mother still resided on the paternal estate, of which she had the control as executrix. Mr. Wylder and Miss Chilton were much together at parties, and also took frequent rides to Georgetown, the Navy-Yard, and other places of resort, in all which- time they had opportunities to converse on matrimony, which it is presumed they did not wholly neglect;, for it was soon whispered in the, visiting-circles that they were betrothed.. Of course the lovely Miss Chilton drew upon   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       241 herself some ill-natured remarks from several of her rival associates who had fixed their eyes on Mr. Wylder with conjugal intent. Nothing very serious, however, grew out of these momentary fits of spleen. It was generally known that Mr. Wylder was a first-rate match; and he was looked upon with favor by anxious mothers who had daughters on hand, and by young ladies themselves, who prefer exercising their own judgment in the choice of a husband. After Miss Chilton had recovered from the first timidity of her new situation, she began to inquire of Mr. Wylder respecting his section of country,-how it would compare with Virginia as to society and other sources of enjoyment. The dialogue can be best stated in their own words:- Miss C.--"Since I have consented to accompany you home, I am   dying of curiosity to know what sort of people I shall meet, and what is the character of the country for health, and a hundred less important things, which I cannot now express." Mr. W.--"My dear Miss Chilton, I am glad that I can answer the two principal inquiries to your satisfaction. Those who will be nearest to you in my State, you will soon love as your own kindred. My parents will embrace and treat you as-a daughter. My friends will be your friends most cordially. As to society, we consider ourselves pretty well off; and I hope you will not be disappointed. Candor obligeo me to state, however, that with us society is a little different from what'it is in Washington, and, I think, much to- our praise." Miss C.-"Pray, Mr. Critic, what objections have you to people here? I should like to know your real sen- timents, and I must insist on a full disclosure. No dodging, now. I am  not compelled to expose you, even if you think proper to be a little uncharitable." Mr. W.--' I don't like to be too candid, lest youfshould sympathize with the offenders, and recall your pledge to Q         21  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7248-00000122"/> 242       WILKINS WYDER; OR, me. I won't incur the risk, unless you promise to stand firm." Miss C.-"If you won't express your opinion on any other terms, I suppose I must comply. Go on with your fault-finding, sir, and I will lister." Mr. W.-"My charming Maria, (I hope you will forgive the familiarity, as I was always partial to the name, even before I saw you,) you have been surrounded by a wall of etiquette which prevented you from knowing the opinions of the people respecting fashionable society in Washington. The relation in which we stand to each other will justify me in calling over a few blemishes." Miss C.-"I like your. moderate language ; for I was fearful you would at once indict society here for high crimes and misdemeanors, as some of the letter-writers have charged upon it. The word 'blemishes' speaks much for your generosity; and I begin to have confidence in your criticism before I hear it. Go on, Mr. Wylder: I am all attention." Mr. W.--On reflection, I believe I shall decline the task altogether. It would appear ungrateful in me th complain of society here, when I am indebted to it for the greatest happiness which can be bestowed on me, in your love,' angelic Maria. I must praise the bridge that carries me safe over. What I really think on the subject is of no consequence; for I presume that the blemishes per- ceivable to my unpractised eye are really no defects whatever when fairly examined. So I deem it best to keep silence, out of gratitude for the inestimable prize I have drawn in the lottery." Miss C.--"And do you call it a lottery-a mere accident -by which you obtained the prize, as you are pleased to call me? Be guarded in your speech; or I shall wage a controversy with you by which you may judge in advance of my talent in that line. A lottery, indeed! no selection, eh?"'    ltHE S UUUESSFUL MAN .     Z4 Mr. W.-"Oh, yes, I had a wide field to choose in, and you had liberty to refuse; but we were mutually pleased, and we are now plighted. Still, I maintain that marriage is a lottery, and that too often the men prove blanks, I am sorry for your sex that it is so. As to the ladies, of course they are all prizes, unless they happen to turn out other- wise. This is all the argument I have to give on matri- monial lotteries. A draw in Washington is attended with no risk whatever,--where the parties harmonize." Miss C.-"You are an artful pleader, Mr. Wylder; but I must bring you back to the previous question, as they say in your House, which is society here. You are entitled to the fl6or." Mr. W.-"In order to divest my remarks of any offensive bearing, I shall begin at the White House. The President gives dinners twice a week during the session, and it is said that he goes through the roll of Congress until all the members have partaken of his official hospitality. When it came to my turn, I accepted, and had the honor of dining at his table. There I saw a large number of ladies and gentlemen all paired off together, in which arrangement I perceived great propriety. You know how these things are conducted; for I saw you present. Thus far I have no objection. It was intended that the gentleman and lady thus placed together at table should entertain each other, which might be done in a quiet, unpretending manner. To my surprise, I heard several ladies, married and single, raise their voices so high, to play off their wit and fine sayings, as to excite the attention of all the company. Now, the indelicacy consists in turning from your table- companion, thereby implying that he was unable to interest you. Such, at least, would be my interpretation were I thus treated. Have you any defence to make for your lady friends in this particular?" Miss C.-- I agree that the conduct you mention is objectionable; and I never witnessed-it without regret. I  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7248-00000123"/> 244       WILKINS WYDER; OR, am happy to say that it is very uncommon at the Presi- dent's table, and the ladies who transgressed, no doubt, soon repented. There is one custom, however, for which I give our people credit. When in the presence of distinguished foreigners, noblemen and ambassadors, they always act with dignity. All is deference and good breeding, without the least variation." Mr. W.-"You have digressed to a point in which society here is most vulnerable,-its homage to titles and display. If a man is introduced as Count de Ignoranze or Lord Heartless, however stupid he may be, he is at once a lion, and nobody else can be talked about or praised. The ladies especially permit their gentle minds to be disturbed by such insignificant cause, whilst a leading statesman, hero, jurist, or author, of their own country would create no sensation whatever by his presence. Allow me to say that a very serious defect in society here is its reckless ambi- tion of display. - Every thing is sacrificed to this great end. Hollow conventionalities rule, to the exclusion of sincerity, truth, and all the real virtues which should elevate and adorn character. Society as here constituted is a sort of intellectual toy, made to utter sounds which any ventrilo- quist may throw into its chest: still, it is a splendid reality,  -perhaps the most complete that poor human nature can attain. A man or woman who has passed a few winters in society here will never forget the dream, at once melan- choly and pleasant to recall. It furnishes the key to our national character, and unlocks many little recesses of deceit and rivalry which, I regret to say, are inseparable from high civilization. Whilst I perceive the blemish, I am not certain that any amendment is practicable; and so I must leave the subject, as I found it, in most admirable obscurity, just as questions are frequently left after the most elaborate discussion." Miss C.-"Really, Mr. Wylder, you have succeeded in thrashing society in a very cavalier style, and, like a true   cavalier, you bind up the wounds which your sword inflicted. I admire your generosity, and must admit that your criti- cism is not without force. I am glad, for several reasons, that this conversation began, the principal of which is that I have ascertained your keen perceptive faculties, so that I may turn the information to profit in my future life. Now, after the argument, it may be necessary to have a little recreation, which we can find by a walk to the Pre- sident's Square, where the navy band is about to open its evening music."  Mr. Wylder and Miss Chilton then strolled to the square, and remained an hour in the large collection of people always present on such occasions, after which they came back to the Indian Queen Hotel. In a few weeks Miss Chilton returned to her mother's homestcad in Virginia, to await tne consummation of her nuptials. Soon after the adjournment of Congress, Mr. Wylder was to call on his way home, and the wedding was to take place. Nothing more need be said in relation to the lovers until the happy period when they shall stand together as bridegroom and bride under the maternal roof. The in- terval was, no doubt, occupied by the most agreeable visions, by plans to make each other happy, and by the interchange of loving notes which it is not the privilege of the historian to read. The 30th day of June, which had been fixed for the ad- journment of Congress, was drawing near, and Mr. Wylder had not made his debut as a speaker. Every thing now was done in a hurry. Reports from committee were laid on the table, and ordered to be printed, without being read in the House. Private bills were passed or rejected with- out any attention to the merits. A few Revolutionary claimants who had been waiting for months to see their bills-through both Houses, and who had devoted much of their time to improving the acquaintance of members, had to return home without the fulfilment of their hopes. 21*  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7248-00000124"/> artVk      W lliN O W Y MAn j UOR Many persons whose property had been taken for Govern- ment use in the War of 1812 and in subsequent Indian wars, and whose evidence in support of their claims had been collected at much trouble and expense, were disap- pointed in the compensation they asked, by the bills not being reached on the calender in time for final action. The families of deceased officers of the army and navy, who were also suitors for the justice of Congress, shared, in many instances, no better fate. Much time was con- sumed in motions to take up particular bills, without avail. There was an effort made to pass the appropriation bill, and, when it was before the House for consideration, a great many items were engrafted, allowing large sums of money to improve certain rivers and harbors, to build lighthouses, to increase navy-yards, to pay Indian agents, and for other objects, amounting to several millions of dollars, not one of which, perhaps, could have passed in a separate bill: yet they were admitted on the log-rolling principle,--"you help me and I'll help you." Such a course filled the mind of Mr. Wylder with absolute disgust, and he resolved to express his abhorrence if time permitted. But the period for making speeches had passed. No member was allowed the floor beyond five minutes. Gen- tlemen were moving from seat to seat, explaining particular items, and the logs were rolled with a vengeance. In this way the act appropriating money for the support of Go- vernment for the next political year astonished the country, and was made an element in the Presidential election, greatly to the prejudice of the Administration, which had a majority in Congress. Mr. Wylder saw this irregularity: indeed, all who had eyes and ears to observe understood the fact, and even members of Congress who were drawn into the whirlpool of venality in order to get a crumb or two from the Trea- sury to show their constituents, regretted it, and gave pledges of amendment in future. Mr. Wylder made no   sacrifice of principle to increase his popularity. He had given his votes free from the influence of selfish motives, and was ready to face his constituents without a blush and without apprehension of their displeasure. The next morning after the adjournment of Congress, Mr. Wylder proceeded homeward, to ratify in Virginia a contract made in Washington, by which a fair daughter of the Old Do. minion was to be transplanted a few\degrees farther South. CHAPTER XXTX. ON leaving Washington, Mr. Wylder was accompanied by the Hon. Henry Carleton, one of his colleagues, and the Hon. Madison Jones, Representative in Congress from the District in which Mrs. Chilton resided. They arrived at Preston, the county-seat, on the evening previous to that appointed for the wedding. Mr. Wylder sent a note next morning to Miss Chilton, six miles in the country, notifying her of his presence in the village, where he should remain, allowing himself time to reach her mother's residence by sunset that evening. He left her to select the parson who was to officiate at the marriage ceremony, and stated that he had two friends with him, whose names he mentioned, as his only escort. Miss Chilton replied in a few lines by the messenger, saying that she was happy to hear of his safe arrival, and that due preparation had been made by her mother for the nuptial fete. There was great animation in the society of the village when it was ascertained that the gentleman who was to marry the reigning belle, Miss Chilton, had arrived, and was soon to' bear off his lovely prize. The old people talked of her girlhood, how amiable she had ever been, and how her mother and relations would miss her company. The young ladies speculated as to her choice, whether he \o   &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7248-00000125"/> 248       WILKINS WYDER; -OR, was handsome, rich and kind-hearted. They sent their little brothers between school-hours to look in at the hotel and get a peep at the bridegroom. The lady of the hotel, Mrs. Mershon, received many visits that day from mothers and daughters who seldom honored her yith a call. Mr. Wylder saw the curiosity that prevailed, and put himself to no trouble to defeat it.- He sat in the piazza of the hotel and strolled about the village with his two friends as if he was not the centre of observation. Mr. Jones was well acquainted in the town, and introduced Mr. Wylder to, several gentlemen whom they casually met. Early in the afternoon, the fine new carriage which Mr. Wylder purchased at Washington City, was rolled before the hotel, and under the direction of the sprightly mulatto driver, who was the body servant of Mr. Wylder, the carriage and mountings were all thoroughly burnished. The splendid dark-bay horses, and their rich harness, were also duly fixed up for the hour's drive which was fast approaching. At all the dwellings and stores that commanded a view of the hotel, might be seen curious spectators, looking out for the departure.. During the interval, many remarks were made by the inhabitants, old and young, relative to the Chilton family. "Old Mr. Chilton," they said, "died rich, and, as might be expected, his children would look out for big matches. Miss Maria had been courted by several clever young men, some of them also rich; but she had refused them all. She was determined to have just such a husband as she wanted, or she would have none; and for this purpose she had spent several winters at Washington, to make the acquaintance of Congressmen and other grand people. Here was her choice, Mr. Wylder, a member of, Congress from the State of  . They say he is a firstrate man, smart, rich, and good-natured. It is to be hoped that he will make Maria happy. This way of marrying strangers is not safe at all times. You all know Laura Willis, who married Mr.   THE SUCCESSFUL 'MAN.       249 Fearn, of Missouri. He was said to own a bank, and a great many lead-mines, iron-foundries and steamboats, the whole worth a million of dollars. Her friends jumped at the offer, and advised her to marry him at once. She did so; and, poor thing, when she arrived at St. Louis, where Mr. Fearn lived, she found out that he was nothing but a clerk on a" steamboat! He got up the story just to cut a dash and see what rich girl he could fool. What a pity if Maria Chilton should be deceived! But that can hardly be pos- sible. Mr. Wylder would not be sent to Congress except he was somebody at home; and, besides, Mrs. Chilton is too wide awake to allow one of her daughters to marry at a venture.", The strength of the village was put in requisition when Mr. Vylder's carriage was in readiness and that gentle- man, with his two friends, stepped into it. It was evidently a scene of rare occurrence, or so much interest would not have been manifested. There was really something to excite reflection besides idle curiosity, in the fact that a brilliant young lady, who had been raised among the people, was about to leave them for another State, where she was to reside and where sooner or later her ashes would slumber. Some of the young ladies of the village had been schoolmates of Maria, and she was acquainted with their families. They all loved her; and it was natural that they should sympathize in a step of so much import- ance to her. Many of them shed tears as the wedding- party disappeared from view. Those were sacred drops of friendship. Just as the western sky represented a sheet of burnished gold, and the last rays of the sun shed a mellow light on the landscape, a carriage was seen coming up the long avenue shaded by elm-trees to Mrs. Chilton's dwelling. A large collection of carriages was already there, standing in rows closely packed, while the horses had been taken to the stables and barn-yard. -A number of gayly-dressed  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7248-00000126"/> 250 .      WILKINS WYDER; OR, ladies and gentlemen were strolling amid the flowers in front of the mansion, and others were standing in the portico. Some two or three dozen servants were in readi- ness to wait on all new-comers. Every face had a pleasant expression, and the whole scene was beautiful to look upon. It was soon whispered that the carriage of the bridegroom was near. All eyes gazed intently in that direction. In a private parlor, where Mrs. Chilton usually received her lady visitors, there sat Maria on a sofa, dressed in all the splendor and simplicity of a bride. Her face rapidly changed -expression: at one moment it was wreathed in smiles, and again a shade of sadness passed over it. Her bosom heaved with deep swelling emotion. In reply to the kind remark sof friends around her, she spoke but few words. She felt oppressed, yet happy. At her request, her mother remained by her side. At length Mr. Wylder, with a friend at each side, ascended the steps of the portico in full dress. Lieutenant Chilton received him with marked cordiality, and, con- ducting him tothe bride, introduced him to his mother, with whom he had a few words of conversation. He then took a seat by Maria Chilton, who met his fond gaze by a gentle, confiding look. Then, taking her hand, Mr. Wylder inquired after her health, and expressed his delight at being in her society once more. At this moment Lieutenant Chilton re-entered the room and stated that the Rev. Dr. Roberts was ready to receive the candidates for matrimony. Mr. Wylder, taking the right arm of Miss Chilton under his left, repaired with his beautiful bride to the drawing-room, and stood before the rector, who was dressed in his robes to perform the nuptial ceremony. Surrounded by the attendants and the large throng of guests, the couple presented a very interesting appearance: Soon the vows were plighted, the blessing invoked, and all was congratulation. Two trusting hearts were united                 .      * .   until death should still the motion's of one or the other of them. The bride claimed the privilege of introducing her husband to the Rev. Dr. Roberts, her old friend and pastor. The happy couple and their clerical companion said many agreeable things in each others' presence. Mr. Wylder, leaving his bride in such good hands, mingled with the guests, to whom he was generally introduced. Mr. Carleton and Mr. Jones stood near him, the latter officiating in most of the introductions. When supper was announced, Mr. Wylder conducted his bride to the dining-room, followed by the company in pairs of a lady and gentleman, who in that order took seats at the table. The banquet was not less grand in the arrangement than for the delicacy of the dishes and the abundance of every thing usual on such occasions. There seemed to prevail a general desire to please and be pleased; and the supper gave great satisfaction both to the eye and the appetite. Returning to the drawing-room, the company entered into free and pleasant conversation,-no one feeling like a stranger, and iO one neglected. The nights of July are not so warm in Virginia as they are farther South; yet the moonlight was so inviting that many of the young people promenaded in the groves and among the flowers. Some, more delicate, chose to avoid the night air, and either walked in the passages of the house or remained in the parlor for conversation. Mr. Jones, approaching the bride, assured her of his joy in seeing her the. heroine of the festive occasion, and he hoped that her example would induce other fair daughters of Virginia to try their for- tunes at Washington. A very pleasant dialogue was kept up between them, in which Mr. Wylder joined occasionally, all testifying to the spirited attractions of society at the seat of Government during the session of Congress. Mr. Wylder took occasion to have a long chat with his  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7248-00000127"/> 252       WILKINS WYDER; OR, mother-in-law, for- the first time. She was evidently pleased with him, and found that he was deserving the good name-wVhich had been given him -from every quarter before she consented to her daughter's engagement. On his part, Mr. Wylder saw in Mrs. Chilton every thing to admire and love. She possessed common sense united with great refinement of manners,--a junction of qualities more rarely seen, in man or woman, than is commonly supposed. At a seasonable hour the company retired, and Mr. Wylder was left alone with the family. He remained two days at the house of his mother-in-law, during which time the bride prepared to leave for her new home. Mr. Carleton purchased a horse and buggy, and remained to accompany his friend to Wylder Hall. In the mean while, Maria (it is too formal to call her Mrs. Wylder yet) paid farewell visits to the black people belonging to the estate. She went to many of the " cabins," made little presents to the women and children, and asked them not to forget -her, promising that sle would see them again in a few months, as Mr. Wylder came back to Washington, and she would then tell them all about the far South. When she called on the old woman Fanny, who had nursed her when a child, Maria shed tears as she extended her hand. The old woman exclaimed, "Ah, Missie Maria, I see you no more. When you come back, old Fanny be dead. God bless you, Missie Maria. I hope you have good husband."  Lieutenant Chilton showed Mr. Wylder the condition of the estate, and the share to whici he would be entitled, remarking that a division could be made at any time after the crop was gathered. The cash on hand he could receive then, if he thought proper. Mr. Wylder replied that he had no desire for an early settlement. It would be time enough to look into the matter on his return from Congress the next spring. As to the cash at his disposal, he had no particular use for it then, but if he should wish to invest it he would order checks as he might need them.   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       253 He inquired of his brother-in-law as to what sum his drafts would be honored. The reply was that it would be per. fectly convenient to pay him   forty thousand dollars, although that was not the full amount. Most of it was loaned out at simple interest in good hands, subject to call.                     i The morning of departure came, and adieus were taken, Mrs. Chilton pressing her daughter to her bosom, and yielding her up with perfect confidence to the husband of her choice. The long journey was performed without any accident, with good effects upon the health, if not to the uniform comfort, of the travelers. Mrs. Wylder Was pleased with the constant change she witnessed on the route, and with the beautiful towns and settlements through which  she passed. Arriving at Wylder Hall, they found all its inmates in good health. CHAPTER XXX. THE introduction of the bride at Wylder Hall was a joyous event. She was received by the parents of Mr. Wylder with the sincerest affection. Every little comfort which could be devised was placed at her disposal. Her room was furnished in the richest style. The best servants of the household were assigned to her. Indeed, the fair daughter of the Old Dominion fully realized all her dreams of happiness in her new sphere. She was proud of her choice. Mr. Wylder was devoted in his attentions, not permitting the least semblance of neglect to overshadow the spirit of his bride. He had taken her from a brilliant circle at Washington, where she wasna leading figure; and now, in the solitude of country life to which she had accompanied him, he was determined to make her happy, and to invigorate her enjoyments by society and customs  22  &#xD;<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7248-00000128"/> 254       WILKINS WYDER; OR, less artificial than those from which he had disconnected her by marriage. It was ne'cessary to repose a few days in quiet seclusion before the neighbors were called together by an entertain- ment which Dr. Wylder had projected. The bride took a lively interest -in all the arrangements at Wylder Hall. She rose early with the rest of the family, and, mounting a gentle pony, .she rambled several miles before breakfast, under- the- escort of her husband, who was a graceful cavalier on horseback. On her return, she soon appeared in her morning dress at the breakfast-table, saluting all the members of the family with kind words, and a merry account of her ride, describing objects that were new to her with the artless simplicity which candid natures render so agreeable to others. In one of her pony excursions she met with an adventure which she took delight- in'relating. There was a little brook, some thirty feet wide and two or three deep, wkhich ran across the road over a bed of the purest sand. In crossing it, Mr. Wylder had generally her bridle in his hand, to assure her from accident or alarm. After getting used to the brook, and seeing that it kept the same stage of water, a fancy possessed her to play a harmless trick on her gallant, by requesting him to dismount and tighten her saddle-gearing. He instantly complied, and, being within fifty paces of the brook, she dashed off with lively speed, without waiting for him to regain his saddle. With a mischievous turn of her face backward, and her fair complexion shining with roseate beauty beneath her -black riding-cap and plume, the effect improved to the veriest picture by her golden tresses and snugly-fitted riding-habit, she seemed to be conscious of her skill in attempting a surprise, which was to be per- fected by a fearless gallop across the brook before Mr. Wylder could overtake her. i-She enjoyed the exploit finely until about midway the stream, when the pony stopped suddenly to quench his thirst, and his fair rider Y                     J   lnti BUSUUiESBF5'UL MAN.     255 pitched over his head into the crystal flood, fully immersed, hat, tresses, laughing eyes, and all. Leaping from his saddle, Mr. Wylder soon caught her in his arms, and brought her dripping to the shore. Drying her face with 'is handkerchief, and finding that she was more alarmed than injured, he congratulated her on the success of her bold horsemanship, which he considered as glory enough for one morning. She looked upon her droll figure, and burst into a hearty laugh, confessing that the novelty of' her situation was far from disagreeable. The cold bath had quite refreshed hel and her appetite for breakfast would be a little sharpened: In this pleasant way did the young wife turn to good account the unexpected little casualty.         - Returning home in her battered condition, the fair rider was in high spirits, after renewing her toilet, in telling her mishap to the family. It was a merrk topic for weeks, and it really aided to make her still more a general favorite. The story  took wings through thb neighborhood, and many a joke was founded   upon it, with such variations as might be demanded to render wit and pleasantry the more pungent. Even the church itself indulged in loving humor. When the Rev. Mr. Holton paid his first visit to Wylder Hall after the young couple arrived, he in a very  graceful manner intimated the possibility that the bride had changed her religion since leaving Virginia, and his only inference was that her late immersion signified her preference for a church different from the Episcopal, in which she was raised. Deeming ten or fifteen days sufficient to recover from the fatigue of their late journey, Dr. Wylder appointed a time when his demonstration should be given to the happy pair under his' roof. He intended to make it on a broad scale, such as his own ideas of propriety would suggest, regard- less of the expense. The people of his county were fond of shows, as was clearly proved by their patronage of the circus ,   &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7248-00000129"/> 256       WILKINS WYDER; OR, and travelling caravans whenever they exhibited. He was determined to surpass all the circuses, and to bring forward something new. For this purpose, he ordered a variety of fireworks, a band of music, two pieces of artillery from Charleston, and suitable persons to manage the display in the best style. He laid off ten acres of woodland, covered by oaks and poplars, the undergrowth of which he caused to be removed. In the centre, a large tent, eighty by forty /feet, was erected, resting on posts and covered with rough shingles. The floor was of dressed plank, to allow dancing without injury to tie delicate feet of the ladies. Seats were arranged within convenient distance. A platform at one end was constructed for the music. Tin sockets for a hundred candles were fastened to the posts. At one side was an enclosed chamber twenty feet square, furnished with tables, mirrors, chairs and lounges, for the use of the ladies whenever they wished to regulate their toilets. On the opposite side of the tent was a similar room for the gentlemen. So much for the dancing-department. Two acres were occupied by temporary plank tables, at proper distances, so that the servants might not incom- mode each other in their several stations. The tables were ten in number, each containing one hundred plates, and at the end of the table was an upright board, with figures showing the number, from 1 to 10. Benches were placed the whole length of the table for the people)to sit upon while eating. Bolts of bleached domestic were to be unrolled until all the tables were covered with clean white cloth. To every table ten servants were assigned, and a card pinned to the breast of each, No. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., as the case might be, signifying the table he was to wait upon. This was the order of the eating-department. The cooking enclosure contained many pits for roasting, and furnaces for baking. The supply of beef, mutton, kid, shoats, pigs, turkeys, chickens, and ducks was very abundant, and filled a large temporary store-room. No ...1.    '       *     ,-   persons were allowed to go within the enclosure, except those employed. Then, since many horses would be brought, it was neces- sary to make provision for their safe keeping. A number of strong lot fences were built, with troughs and boxes to feed in, and with water convenient. Provender was at hand for all,-horses, mules, and oxen. A place was laid out for the vehicles under a thick forest-shade. There was no- thing left undone to render the occasion one of pleasure to all who might partake. Every person, little or big, was to feel at ease on the score of comfort and attention provided.     l As to lodgings for the people, that subject had also been taken into consideration. The old men and old women were to be invited to Dr. Wylder's house, where they were to take their meals, if they thought proper, in addition to their lodging. There were several houses where the chil- dren might stay, and be attended to at all times, with a full supply of good things to eat, and toys to amuse them. They were to have their pleasure-rides and to listen to the music, besides seeing the display of fireworks. Their mothers and nurses were to be relieved whenever neces- sary. Dr. Wylder formed this programme, intending it as the best he could do for the occasion. He told his manager, Mr. Richards, to see that it was executed, and to use all the force of the plantation if necessary. If he needed the assistance of white men to look over each department, he was at liberty to employ them. Every thing was to be done according to the plan and instructions. Publicinvitation was given to the citizens of the county by printed cards scattered in every direction and posted up at the court-house and in each captain's beat. Thurs- day was to be the commencement of the "Marriage Feast," and it was to continue until Saturday evening. In the mean time Dr. Wylder had specially invited Captain Haw- R         22'   ,  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7248-00000130"/> 258       WILKINS WYDER ; OR kins and his troop of cavalry, and also Captain Bonham and his volunteer company, to take part in the festivities. Mr. Wylder himself invited a few friends at a distance, among whom was his bachelor colleague in Congress, Mr. Carleton, who attended him at his marriage, and Mr. Watson, the editor of the "Expositor." On Wednesday morning, the artillery, music-band, and materials for fireworks arrived at Wylder Hall. The whole arrangements for the next day had been completed. Dr. Wylder had ordered several hundred cartridges for the cannon, and gave directions that the band next morning at daybreak should play ' "Hail Columbia," and at the close of the music fifty guns should be fired, equal to the united ages of the newly-married couple,--his son twenty-eight, and his daughter-in-law twenty-two. At dawn next morning, the band discoursed sweetest harmony, rousing the fires of patriotism in the soul; after which peals of cannon rent the air and reverberated for miles by way of announcement. At ten o'clock the people began to come in, and by noon not less than one thousand were on the ground. They were all immediately provided with accommodations. The band played every half-hour, which delighted the multitude of visitors. The cloths were spread on the tables, and the cooks and waiters began to pile on the viands. There was no beverage for distribution more animating than cider, which Dr. Wylder had made from his own orchard, several barrels of which, from sweet to hard, as might be agreeable to the guests, were arranged under the trees ready for use. At one o'clock the manager pro- claimed in a loud voice that dinner would be ready in thirty minutes, which would be announced by a gun. Then the people would repair to the tables and be seated in the following order :--Families would sit together, beginning at table No. 1, and so on, until all the' families were first seated. Then the remaining ladies would occupy the tables next in number, until places had been found for them, after   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       259 which the citizens generally would take seats to suit them- selves. The manager requested that all would be patient, as there was plenty of room and refieshments for every one. At this moment the scene was quite interesting, Groups of fashionable ladies and gentlemen could be seen quietly talking and looking on. Near them were the wives and daughters of plain farmers, neatly dressed, sur- rounded by young men from their respective neighbor- hoods, their faces all lighted up with joyful expectation. The signal was given by the cannon, and the throng ad- vanced to the tables very deliberately, in the order re- quested. The band struck up a lively air, called 4 Haste to the Wedding," and continued to play until the people were all seated. Then the feasting began in earnest. Every servant was in his proper place, and all the guests were speedily supplied. At one end of the table in the centre sat the- Rev. Mr. Holton, and on his right the bride and bridegroom, and other members of Dr. Wylder's family, the Hon. Mr. Carleton, Mr. Watson, and guests from a dis- tance. The view of a thousand heads moving to the tune of knife and fork was curious enough. The dishes were skilfully prepared, under the direction of an experienced cook who had been thirty years in that capacity with Dr. Wylder. No person was neglected. As Mr. Holton and his immediate company left the table, the band played "Washington's March." Soon the tables were all deserted. The manager then notified the multitude that at four o'clock dancing would commence at the large saloon; at sunset supper would be placed on the table, to afllow time for the fireworks to begin at dark, before the children went to sleep; after which there would be dancing until a late hour, to suit the pleasure of the young people who might engage in the amusement. At sunrise the band would play, followed by a dozen guns. Breakfast would be on the tables in an hour afterward, to be announced by the firing of a gun. If the military companies arrived,  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7248-00000131"/> LaV     WlbWLKLNS W Y ;nJ UR.; there would be a dress-parade at nine o'clock, to continue one hour; after which all who desired to join in the dance would have the opportunity. At twelve, fruits would be served on the tables, and at two o'clock, dinner. Then all were at liberty to dance or stroll about as best suited them. At five o'clock the military (if on the ground) would go through the forms of battle, with artillery, muskets, and bayonets, swords and pistols. There might be some ter- rible shooting and slashing by the soldiers, and great dis- play by the officers; but there would be no killing, the manager apprehended. He hoped the ladies would not be agitated. When the war was over, peace would begin at the dancing-saloon. Supper would again be on the - tables at sundown, to be succeeded by another exhibition of fire- works entirely different from those of the preceding night. On Saturday morning another discharge of artillery at sunrise, then music and breakfast, and a variety of amuse- ments until lunch at twelve o'clock. Dinner would be served at two, and at four o'clock the band would play "Home, Sweet Home," and a dozen rounds of the cannon would signify that the "Marriage Feast" had closed. Mr Richards, the agreeable manager, told the people that he was thus particular in giving notice of what was to take place, to induce them to remain. He hoped none of them would go away until they had listened to that best of all tunes, "Home, Sweet Home," which would be played in a style they never heard before and might never hear again; that Dr. Wylder had made ample provision for the comfort of all who had honored him with their presence, and he would take it as a favor if they would feel at home and enjoythemselves as best they could. The next movement was at the dancing-saloon. All the seats around it were occupied by oland young. Mr Wylder took his bride by the hand,/ a coiducted her across the saloon, as if to lead in the dance, whet, turning to the com- pany, he said, "Neighbors and frien s, I take great plea-   sure in introducing to you all Mrs. Wylder, who was late Miss Chilton, of Virginia. Neither of us 'dance, or we should readily join in the amusement. She requests me to say that she feels highly gratified at seeing you, and that you all have her best wishes." By a wave of his hand, he beckoned Mr. Carleton to come forward, and then said, "This is my friend, the Hon. Mr. Carleton, one of my col- leagues in Congress. He did me the honor to attend my marriage; and I hope he will not refuse to open the dance as my representative, with such fair partner as he may select to represent Mrs. Wylder." Mr. Carleton bowed a cheerful assent, and immediately led on the floor the beau- tiful Miss Evelina Gibbs. The music then struck up, and in a few moments the floor was covered with merry dancers. It was a pleasant scene, and every person caught the humor. Several fathers and mothers, with grown children in the dance, joined in the delightful exercise. Who could resist such music? It gave new life to the whole multitude of spectators. The dance continued about two hours, and, when it ceased, drums were heard at a distance. The rumor instantly circulated that the volunteers and cavalry were coming. The curiosity of the people was excited to the highest pitch. The bugle-blast of the cavalry became more distinct, and soon the handsome Pulaski Troop, in splendid uniform, with holsters at their saddle-bows, came in view, and, just behind, the De Kalb Volunteers, in stately march. Two guns were fired as salutes. Dr. Wylder met them, and extended a cordial welcome. They were shown to the quarters which had been reserved for them, where refresh- ments were supplied. But the greatest wonder of all was now at hand,-the display of fireworks. The people seated themselves on the table-benches, and the director of the exhibition ascended the platform which had been erected for him and his assistants. A dim light revealed a variety of *     .   &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7248-00000132"/> 22-       WILKINS WYDER; OR, curious wheels and odd-looking figures of machinery. A large rocket was sent up some two hundred feet in the air, which then exploded with a loud noise, sending a shower of brilliant sparks in every direction. The next thing was an illuminated wheel, with countless jets of light, and in a few moments its evolutions began, throwing out variegated flames with a hissing sound, to the astonish- ment of people who had never seen the like before. Then large fiery serpents ascended in the air, and, branching off horizontally, broke themselves to pieces in the tops of the trees. A number of Bengola lights and Roman candles, and many combinations not easily described, then fol- lowed; while at every interval a rocket ascended. The gratification of the multitude and the noisy wonder of the children knew no bounds. There seemed to be a total surrender to the unique entertainment. The display closed by a flight of rockets grander than any which had pre- ceded them. The band then played "Marion's March," after which a gun was fired, and the people betook them- selves to repose,-if that were possible after so many exciting objects in the course of the day. Next morning at nine o'clock the Pulaski Troop and De Kalb Volunteers paraded in full-dress uniform, with all the trappings of war. Preferring the cool of the day for the battle, the companies were divided into two equal parts, and half the cavalry and half the infantry stood together in line, about two hundred yards apart, facing their late comrades but now exasperated enemies. On each side there was a field-piece. The commanders rode in front of their men, giving orders, and exhorting them to stand firm in battle. The drums and fifes sounded to the charge, and the two columns advanced on each other, while the cannon jarred the ground and the discharge of musketry denoted the great struggle. The cavalry on the left of one line and on the right of the other rushed forward with clashing swords. In the mean time several --- '- \                  of the infantry fell in the charge before the combatants engaged hand to hand with bayonets, in close quarters. The havoc that ensued was distressing to behold. Men were seen to stagger and fall to the ground, and then bravely raise themselves to strike another blow before death rendered them powerless. The pistols and swords of the cavalry did not cause such destruction of life, although several were badly wounded, as they were seen to droop in their saddles and place their hands on their breasts as if suffering. It was generally believed that the cavalry escaped death by determining beforehand not to fall to the ground, lest their bodies might be disfigured by the hoofs of the horses, or otherwise damaged. Such a resolution was certainly most wise in this campaign, how- ever difficult it might be in foreign wars to derive the same protection from it. The fight was conducted according to the best military science. Both parties being equally brave and skilled in the use of arms, neither could get any advantage, and both honorably retreated at the sound of the bugle. Such was fhe termination of this fiercely-contested battle, which frightened the ladies, and caused even the men to fear that the combatants would do bloody execution in spite of the innocent programme. The warriors then stacked arms, and refreshed themselves by copious draughts of cider, the dead and wounded joining in the harmless pota- tions. Then the dancing was resumed, the interest of which was greatly heightened by the military figures on the floor. At noon lunch was again served in the fruit- line, after which there was a general rest until dinner. The afternoon passed in the usual way, and the night was enlivened by another and still more beautiful exhibi- tion of fireworks. In the mornipg a dozen guns were fired at dawn, and the drums and fifes and brass band played several airs, which dispelled all drowsiness. After breakfast the volunteers beat to ranks, and went through ,-  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7248-00000133"/> 264       WILKINS WYDER; OR, a handsome drill-exercise. The cavalry also formed into line and gave a specimen of their rapid evolutions. Then both companies retired to one side of the grove, where they practised target-firing one hour, the volunteers with their muskets at sixty paces, and the cavalry with their pistols at twenty. A number of close shots were made, which were exhibited to the people by holding up the target at the head of a music procession. The effect was animating in the extreme, and the victors marched in front, escorted by a guard of honor. The amusements at the saloon went on gayly. At the suggestion of the manager, all the boys and girls were invited to dance with each other. Fifty couples, from twelve to six years of age, appeared on the floor, with smiling faces, to execute movements in imitation of the seniors, whom they had watched with envious feelings. The children's dance was the main attraction of the day. As one set retired, another came on, until they all had a fair showing. Their complexions glowed with health and innocent emotions, unless indeed the ten and twelve year old masters and misses regarded each other with a sort of Cupid squint, not altogether innocent for persons of their tender experience. However, who does not love children? and if children happen to love each other, who can blame them for obeying a natural law? The festivities were hastening to a close; and it only remained for Dr. Wylder to carry out a whimsical idea, which was to ascertain the number of heads of families present, and then all. the remnants of the feast, and a. number of toys and fancy garments for children, arranged into as many lots, were to be drawn for, on the principles of a lottery. The manager reported that two hundred persons were on the ground who were heads of families, the names of which he gave in. Tickets numbered from 1 to 200 were then made out, to be attached to the parcels, and duplicates placed in a box, to be drawn as each- name   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       265 was called. This scheme, however, was not to be pro- claimed until after dinner. The lottery was to be the winding up of the "Feast," as thereby all the remaining portions thereof would be then and there distributed. More abundant, if possible, than all its predecessors was the last dinner. The quantity of meats was astonishing. Very few persons had as yet left the ground. A military dance at the saloon attracted most of the people there, while the manager was seen tearing up the table-cloths into strips of about two yards each, and spreading them side by side on'the tables, while the servants piled large fragments of roasted meats on each strip of cloth, and instantly covered them. An assistant followed with tickets, one of which he pinned to each parcel, and laid by its side a small paper bundle containing presents for the children. When all was finished, the manager addressed the people, and said he was authorized by Dr. Wylder to return his thanks to his neighbors and friends who had accepted his invitation, and to request the heads of families to take home with them some little sign of the "Feast." For this object, the manager desired the persons, as their names were called, to come to the small box he held in his hand and each to draw out a ticket. The list of names was then called, and heads of families as they answered drew from the box a little card with figures on'it. They could not imagine its meaning, or attach any value to it, and believed the card itself was the keepsake. When the list was through, the manager informed the ticket-holders that on the tables they would find parcels corresponding with their numbers, which they would please take home with them, and that now the "Feast" was over. At this moment the gun was fired, and the band played "Home, Sweet Home," until the ticket-holders had removed from the table the little prizes which they had drawn in the manager's lottery. All passed off in good feeling. The 23  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7248-00000134"/> 266       WILKINS WYDER; OR, servants brought out the vehicles and harnessed in the horses, and there was a long train bound homeward from Wylder Hall. Mr. Carleton, Mr. Watson, and the military companies did not leaye with the rest, as Dr. Wylder had requested them to remain until Monday. Mr. Wylder and his bride showed them, marked civilities, giving sketches of the officers, -of the army and navy whom they bad met at Washington, and reating pleasant anecdotes of their fami- lies, the high esteem in which military characters were held in society, and their success in matrimonial campaigns.- In return, their military friends of the Pulaski and De Kalb legions said handsome things about the entertainment which had just closed, adding that the bride would long be remembered for her winning address, and thanking her for leaving Virginia to give rise to an occasion of so much popular enjoyment. They declared that more ha4 been done to make people happy by these arrangements than had ever before been attempted in the South, and that a dozen years would not efface the agreeable impressions made on the thousand guests, while the happy couple in whose honor the festivities were given would be universal favorites. CHAPTER XXXI. THE next issue of the ,Expositor" contained the re-. marks of its editor, Mr. Watson, on the great festival at WIylder Hall. His own words may be used in description. "We have just returned from a :very pleasant scene, and have been so dazzled by the magnificence and variety which marked the entertainment that we are incapable of giving utterance to our thoughts. Several years ago, as our readers may recollect, Mr. Wylder, of Franklin, then quite a young man, at his first session in the' Legislature,   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       267 offered resolutions in burlesque of all party platforms, which we felt it our duty to oppose. They prevailed, how- ever, had very extensive circulation, and have, no doubt, answered in a great measure the design of the author, as since then we notice very marked moderation in laying down political creeds. Mr. Wylder was. subsequently elected to Congress, and during the first session he was captivated by the beautiful and accomplished Miss Chilton, of Virginia, whom  he lately introduced as a bride at Wylder Hall. "It was in honor of the marriage that Dr. Wylder gave a public feast, and it was our good fortune to be among the guests. The arrangements were on a grand scale, as may be inferred from the programme. "1. Tables abundantly supplied for more than a thousand persons. "2. An excellent band of music. "3. Military parades in full dress by the Pulaski Troop of cavalry, and the De Kalb Volunteers. "4. A sham battle between these two companies equally divided against each' other, and two pieces of artillery in full play. "5. A large dancing-saloon built for the occasion, to ac- commodate a hundred couples on the floor. The superb music was furnished by the brass band. ".6. Refreshments at all hours of excellent cider and fruits in abuFdance. "7. Special provision for aged persons and for children, -the latter especially delighted with toys and contrivances to please their fancy. "8. Fireworks at night on a large scale, and most suc- cessfully conducted. "9. A generous distribution by lottery of the remains of the 'Marriage Feast' to heads of families, and presents to children. "Such were the principal arrangements, opening on  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7248-00000135"/> 268       WILKINS WYDER; OR, Thursday morning and closing Saturday afternoon. Every thing passed off in the most agreeable manner. The happy couple who were the means of this grand hospitality won golden opinions by their affable deportment. We like the idea vastly, and wish that other wealthy citizens would contribute in a similar way to the amusement of the people. Dr. Wylder is entitled to high commendation for his libe- rality and the- good taste which presided over the ' Mar- riage Feast.' We wish them all, entertainers and guests, long life and much happiness." This exhibition at Wylder Hall created more astonisl- ment among the people than ever circus or menagerie had. It was the theme of remark and fond recollection for many years. The juveniles who witnessed it grew up to maturity fall of pleasant memories, sky-rockets, sparkling wheels, good things to eat, the lively dance, stirring music, and the great battle with swords, pistols, muskets, and bayonets, and the big guns. These impressions stimulated their young minds, and gave them a healthy bearing in the affairs'of life. Mr. Wylder and his bride continued inmates of Wylder Hall. He told his father that after his return from Con- gress in March he would purchase a plantation suited to the force he might bring from Virginia. Early in No- vember, Mr. Wylder and his lady started for Washington, intending to spend a week at Mrs. Chilton's. They made the journey in their private carriage in due time, without any accident. Lieutenant Chilton was off on a cruise, but was expected home by the adjournment of Congress. Mrs. Chilton was delighted with the intelligence derived froim her daughter in relation to her new home, and the splendid reception she met from the relatives of her husband. After resting several days, Mr. Wylder and his lady pro- ceeded to Washington. Congress met as usual on the first Monday in December, and both Houses were called to order by their presiding   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       269 officers. The message of the President was of unusual interest relative to the financial condition of the country. That portion of it which concerned the public revenue and the rates of taxation to support the Government was re- ferred to the Committee on Ways and Means, of which Mr. Wylder was a member. He soon perceived that the great measures which ought to have been matured at the first session of seven months had been deferred to the short session of three months. Hence there was no time for idle/speech-making, and he resolved to contribute his mite of Yabor to the public good, without trying to advance his own reputation in debate. The numerous documents of the first session had been printed, and were divided equally among the members for public distribution. By this means Mr. Wylder furnished his constituents a goodly share, and with each document he sent the following cir- cular :- "WASHNGTON, Dec. 20, 18-. DEAR SIR:-Herewith is a document printed by order of Congress, which I beg you to accept. I feel it my duty to place before my constituents all the information at my command relative to public affairs. Most of the documents contain interesting matter, and are worthy of perusal. I had concluded at one time to deliver a speech in the House of Representatives on the reduction of the Tariff, making simple, to the best of my ability, a subject which it is im- possible for the mass of the people to understand without such assistance. But there is so much business to complete before Congress must expire by its own linitation,-that 1 have abandoned the idea of a speech, and send you this explanation. "I deem proper to say that I shall not be a candidate for re-election. My desire for public life has been fully grati- fied, and I shall henceforth devote my time to agricultural employments, and unite with the cultivators of the soil in improving lan   ds, th breds of stQc, and such other l ?3H   &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7248-00000136"/> 270       WILKINS WYDER; OR, branches of husbandry as conduce most to the. general good. In the mean time, I beg to return my sincere thanks for the generous confidence reposed in me, whilst I shall ever remain your grateful fellow-citizen. W. WYDER." The circular was also published in most of the papers of the State. In laying it before his readers, the editor of the "Expositor" remarked,- "In our columns to-day will be found a brief circular from the Hon. Wilkins Wylder, the able Representative from the Fourth Congressional District, announcing his intention to withdraw from public life. This intelligence will be received with regret by his constituents; for in honoring him they have reflected honor on themselves. Possessing qualifications of a high order, Mr. Wylder has acquired for himself a name and influence in the national councils rarely accorded to one of his age. He has been zealous and bold in the discharge of his public duties, and ' will return to private life there to enjoy in no less degree the favor of his fellow-citizens. His large fortune and great intelligence will enable him to do much for agricul- tural pursuits, and we hope that he will give the'results of his information to his brother planters, through the medium of the press. We could not ask a greater boon to the public. May health and happiness attend him in all the future!" We now pay our respects to Mrs. Wylder, who is again in society at Washington. She had lost nothing of her beauty or sprightliness. Indeed, her friends thought she had improved in the bloom of her cheeks, and was even more entertaining than ever, as she had much that was new to relate concerning the far South. - She attended the Cabinet levees, and those of the foreign ministers, and dined once more at the White House. In a playful manner she informed her friends that it was her last appearance at   THeI SUCCESSFUL MAN.      271 Washington, and that she should see them no more, unless by accident they should meet at some public watering- place, or elsewhere, during their summer excursions, as Mr. Wylder had announced his intention not to be a can- didate for re-election. As Congress drew near its close, another scene of con- fusion was witnessed in the House, some members trying to gain the floor for explanation, or only a few remarks to set themselves right before the country, and others insist- ing that particular bills should be taken up to insure their passage. In this scramble, each for himself, very little was done for the country. The general appropriation bill was hurried through with the usual log-rolling items, and at twelve o'clock on the night of the 3d of March the Speaker brought down his hammer and announced that Congress had no power to sit. Mr. Wylder at once proceeded on his return home, going by Mrs. Chilton's in Virginia. Arriving there, he found Lieutenant Chilton with all the property arranged for a division. One hundred slaves fell to Mr. Wylder's share. He employed a couple of trustworthy men, to whom  he advanced money for the purpose, to buy the necessary wagons and equipments, and to bring the slaves to him in the State where he resided, for a fair compensation. Mrs. Chilton desired her daughter and son-in-law to remain several weeks, in the course of which she would give a large dinner-party, so that something of Virginia character might be seen in its favorite bower of hospitality. But they declined, as they had to make arrangements for housekeeping. Mrs. Wylder again visited a few of the old servants, and told them of her happiness in the South. Her aged nurse Fanny was still alive, and was " mighty glad to see young missus once more." Again on the road, Mr. Wylder and his lady reached home in safety, and in about six weeks his wagons and servants from Virginia arrived. It was too late in the  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7248-00000137"/> 272       WILKINS WYDER; OR, season to pitch a crop with his force, and Mr. Wylder hired out his field-hands until the 1st of December. The women and children were provided for on the Wylder Hall estate. In the month of July, Mr. Wylder and his lady visited the mountain region, and passed over into Tennessee, visiting the Cave and many objects -hich he had seen when aboy in company with his tutor. They went to Nashville, and from thence to the Hermitage, celebrated as the residence of General Jackson. Among the farms of the country they lingered several weeks, taking much pains to learn the art of having good milch cows and of making butter. All the dairy and spring-house arrange- ments were inspected; and the Washington belle, who had graced the drawing-rooms of the President and his Cabinet, was now contented with the wives and daughters of farmers, asking information from them of more interest to her than the fashionable circles could ever again afford. She had passed into a new sphere, and she delighted in it. Henceforth she was to preside over the household of a planter; and she was anxious to qualify herself for the station. They extended their travels to Kentucky, and called on Mr. Clay-at Ashand. They were both well acquainted with the illustrious statesman at the Federal city, and told him that they were soon to commence housekeeping, and wished to take lessons from him by which to select good milch cows, and from Mrs. Clay how to milk them and put up the butter. Of course all this was very agreeable to Mr. Clay, who showed them his finest cattle, and gave them the points to distinguish the superior breeds. Mrs. Clay went through her dairy-routine and poultry-yard, for the gratification of Mrs. Wylder. The interview was closed in a very pleasant manner by an invitation from Mr. Clay to dine at Ashand the next day. Having made arrangements to pursue their journey ISY   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       273 the next morning, they were compelled to decline the honor. Mr. Wylder concluded to see more of Kentucky, and to ascertain where the best stock was to be had. He suc- ceeded in purchasing two Durham  and two Ayrshire cows at three hundred dollars each, to be sent the ensuing winter. He also engaged fifty mules for his plantation, and other stock he should need. The rope and bagging factories were new to him, and he visited feveral to see the work done. The style of fencing used by the farmers around their fields he admired for its strength and sim- plicity, consisting of oak posts ten feet apart, mortised as for bars, and oak puncheons or flat rails inserted in a straight line, even for miles together. This was much neater and more lasting than the common zigzag fence of Southern origin, made of pine rails. However, in the matter of fences the timber of the country had to govern. It seemed curious to Mr. Wylder that he did not see a dozen pine-trees either in Tennessee or Kentucky,-the larger growth being mostly oak, beech, poplar, and walnut. The industrious habits of the people, the plenty that snr- rounded them, and the careful manner in which they provided for their stock in winter, made a favorable im- pression on his mind, and he determined to profit by their model. Mrs. Wylder was everywhere received with great kindness, and whenever she found a house kept in good style, implying a skilful manager, she never failed to inquire into the domestic economy and take instruction. Their health improved by their travels, and their minds were stored with agreeable recollections. Mr. Wylder and his lady returned home after an absence of three months. Dr. Wylder now proposed to his son that he should look out for a settlement of land, not less than five thousand acres, half of which at least should be in a state of cul- tivation, to employ the force under his control,-as, in S  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7248-00000138"/> 274       WILKINS WYDER; OR, addition to the one hundred slaves he brought from Vir- ginia, he (Dr. W.) intended to give him as many more with which to begin planting. And he advised him by all means to procure land of good quality, even though he had to pay a high price, as it would be useless to expend labor on a weak or failing soil. Dr. Wylder said he knew a place ten miles distant containing about' this quantity, of which he had a good opinion, which might probably be had for ten dollars per acre, belonging to the estate of Mason Curtis. Mr. Wylder saw the heirs and examined the place. It had a good dwelling-house and other suit- able improvements, besides a saw and grist mill, two gin- houses, and the necessary negro cabins,-in every respect a situation that Mr. Wylder liked. He inquired the price, and was told that nothing less than ten dollars per acre would buy it, in three instalments. He agreed to give it, and fixed an early day to meet the heirs with an attorney- at-law to prepare the titles. At the time appointed, the titles were duly executed and delivered, and Mr. Wylder's notes were given for the purchase-money, amounting to fifty-six thousand dollars. The time had come when Mr. Wylder was to take a new position in the world, as the head of a family. With the assistance of Mrs. Wylder, he made out a list of furniture and housekeeping articles of every description, and sent it to Dr. Wylder's commission-merchant, who filled it to their satisfaction. It was now in November, and a general transportation began with the wagons and teams. In two weeks every thing was regulated, and the manager took charge of the field-force. The time for which his Virginia negroes were hired had run out, and they were brought home, making two hundred slaves to set upon the planta- tion. The farm-stock and supplies had been purchased of the heirs of Mr. Curtis,-which made things quite con- venient in this line. On the fourth day of December, 18-, Mr. Wylder drove   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       275 up to his new residence, and Mrs. Wylder was duly in- stalled mistress of the house. She found every thing in fine order, the furniture splendid, the carpets rich, and all the rooms well fitted up, and a number of experienced house-servants to do her bidding. All the conveniences she could desire were at hand. To one of her maids she intrusted the keys, and ordered her to give out the pro- visions and to see that they were properly dressed by the cook. Thus far Mrs. Wylder had no experience in her new situation, but she was determined to qualify herself as soon as possible to manage the household and to crry her own keys. A little after dark, tea was upon the table, and Mr. Wylder and his young wife sat down to enjoy it. She took the head of the table, and played the mistress quite agreeably. Mr. Wylder remarked that the life before them was somewhat different from   life in Washington City, and he hoped it would prove even more happy. All that books of romance had said in praise of cottages and shrubbery and music was now about to be tested; and he prayed that their fondest hopes might be realized. Having partaken of their tea, Mr. Wylder rose from the table and kissed his wife, after which he led her to the piano, re- questing her to play such tune as she fancied best. Therei in that large and elegantly-furnished drawing-room, where the foot of stranger or friend had never moved since its new arrangement, the happy pair sat alone and ex- changed silent congratulations. In the next moment, Mrs. Wylder sang and played "Hbome, Sweet Home," with great animation; and then the parties sought repose and bright dreams.  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7248-00000139"/> 276       WILKINS .WYDER; ORB, CHAPTER XXXTT. CIRCUMSTANCES now required great activity and sound judgment on the part of Air. Wylder to manage his large property to advantage. He determined to adopt a plan of his own in keeping accounts. Among the first things, he had his fields surveyed, marked off and numbered. Thus, "Cotton, No.1, 10-acres." "No. 2, 80 acres," &amp;c. "Corn, No. 6, 90 acres." "Oats,. No. 7, 50 acres." When he spread cotton-seed or other fertilizers on any field, he would enter the quantity in a book by its number. When he planted cotton or corn, he-would make a similar entry of the date; and when the crop was gathered he would give the par- ticular field credit for the quantity. In this manner he kept a complete journal, or running account of his planta- tion work, and the same in regard to his mules, cattle, hogs, sheep, &amp;c. He also opened accounts under the head of {' Subsistence of Negroes." 1 :His manager reported every Saturday a statement of provisions issued during the week; and this was charged to "'Subsistence." Under the head of "Incidental Expenses" he charged the cost of clothing, shoes, hats, blankets, sugar, coffee, tobacco, pocket-knives, medical attendance, &amp;c. furnished the Astev-. At the end of the year he posted up all these items, and was enabled to see his expenses, and the yield of his plantation, which field and what species of cotton was most productive, the substance of which he reported in the '(Southern Agricul- turist," for the information of his brother planters. Mr. Wylder also took newspapers and periodicals devoted to husbandry, all of which he read with attention, and made   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      2" experiments either with his soil or his stock according to the directions given, if he thought them profitable. An event now occurred in his domestic life which thrilled his heart with a new joy,-the birth of a son. His cup of happiness overflowed. He looked upon himself as the most fortunate of beings. His father and mother were with him on the glad occasion, and congratulated the young parents most heartily. Dr. Wylder had lived to see what he had long desired,-a grandchild to bear his name and his blood to other generations. Mr. Wylder wrote to his wife's mother as follows:- "CURTIS LODGE, Feb. 20, 18--. 4"MY DEAR MOTHER CHLTON:-I am happy to inform you that Maria gave birth to a fine son last night, and that the two are doing well. Both my parents are with us, and are rejoiced at the event. As yet we have not selected a name. Can you assist us in this delicate matter? Shall it be called George Washington, or James Chilton?--two natives of the Old Dominion; and though one was great in the estimation of the world, the other was equally vir- tuous in his sphere and as much loved. If you can pay us a visit this spring, we shall be delighted to see you. We are much pleased with our new residence. Should you fail to come, we shall be obliged, from our anxiety to show you the dear little boy, to pay our respects to you in per- son, in the course of our rambles next summer, if nothing prevents. "Maria desires me to say to you that she feels like a new being, with her angel babe drawing its nourishment from her bosom. With messages of love to all, I remain yours affectionately,           W. WYDER." There was sunshine in the household of Mr Wylder. All things worked smoothly. Ilis mules and blooded cattle from Kentucky had in the meantime been received. He 24 *  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7248-00000140"/> 278       WILKINS WYDER; OR, rode over his large plantation daily, and made suggestions to his experienced and faithful manager, -as new ideas had been communicated to his mind by the agricultural papers, or by successful planters with -whom he conversed. He saw that his slaves had comfortable cabins, good blankets, warm clothing, and plenty of wholesome provisions* They were not overworked, though they were required to be diligent. He caused a meeting-house to be erected, where divine service was held every Sabbath, and which it was made their duty to attend. His time was industriously oc- cupied: not a moment did he waste. When he had company at his house, he gave them all proper attention, and, whether ladies or gentlemen, he usually invited them to see his fine cattle, or the plan of his grounds, thus affording them plea- sure and cause for useful reflection at the same time. He often took them to his library and showed them many rare books and engravings which he had collected, and re- quested them to examine at pleasure while business called him into the fields. His style of hospitality was liberal and refined. There .was no assumed consequence in his manners; nor did he ever depart from the dignity and self- respect of the true gentleman by indulging a blunt fami- liarity. He looked upon man as capable of his highest enjoyments only when under the influence of an elevated taste. Such was the beginning of Mr Wylder's new career. He had often looked forward to it with happy anticipation. Of all pursuits he considered the cultivation of the soil as the most tranquil and satisfactory on earth. True, he set a high value on other employments as necessary; but the basis and support of all was agriculture, and to this he devoted himself as well from a sense of duty as from in- clination. As shown by the narrative, his mind had been carefully improved in his youth, and he had ever since been adding new strength and knowledge by grappling with the practical affairs of life, both public and social. Now, in his   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       279 thirtieth year, he was in a condition which the proudest might envy. A finished scholar, of integrity unimpeached, and a gentleman of elegant address, possessing a large fortune and-good health, and, to crown all, blessed with a gentle and loving wife, and an infant son, to share and re- present his honors,-such was the reality and such the pros- pect to render life a scene of enchantment. But soon this blooming paradise, where the flowers of joy grow in profusion, is to experience its first grief. As if to mock human delights, some destroying presence is always near. Nlever can we flatter ourselves with good, but evil is sure to dash our cup the very moment when we promise ourselves the purest gratifications of the heart. In all this there is wisdom and mercy; but in the midst of our troubles we perceive not the hand of our Father, who chastens only to bless'us the more abundantly. Five or six weeks after the birth of her son, Mrs. Wylder took an airing in the carriage. The morning was fair, and no danger was apprehended. It was believed that the cold gusts of March had passed, as vegetation was putting forth, and a few early flowers were seen heralding the approach of spring.  Mrs. Wylder had not been gone more than half an hour before clouds began to darken the atmosphere, and in a few minutes a heavy shower of rain descended. She was within a mile of home when the hardest of the shower fell, and was protected by the carriage from getting wet; but she became much alarmed, and her fears, added to the dampness, brought on a   chilly sensation, which was not relieved by the warm bed to which she was immediately conveyed in the 'arms of her husband, who had been anxiously awaiting her return, and had himself been ex- ,posed to the. rain while riding in his plantation, and had just changed his clothing when the carriage drove up with his chilled wife. Dr. Wylder was immediately summoned; but it was several hours before he could reach her, owing to the distance. He at once saw the danger, but concealed it  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7248-00000141"/> 280       WILKINS WYDER; OR) from his son. His remedies only held the disease in check while it ran its fearful course. Nothing could subdue it. The only alternative that remained was to salivate the patient, with the hope of saving life, and risk. the conse- quences. This condition was produced; but what sad havoc it made of the beautiful face of Mrs, Wylder! For more than a week her mouth was swollen and putrid as an ulcer. No traces of her former self could be discovered. What a lesson is taught at the bedside of affliction! There the great and lowly of earth are equally helpless. The Washingtoielle, once arrayed in the height of fashion and her b auty charming all beholders, is no better than the rough/country girl who never had a silk dress nor heard the notes of a piano. On a sick-bed both are suf- ferers alike,--except that the vigorous constitution of the rustic girl enables her to bear up under the attack more successfully. Mr. Wylder seldom left the bedside of his sick wife. He nursed her tenderly at all hours of the day and night. She often requested him to take repose; but he declined until his strength was exhausted. - Then he would sleep a few hours and return to his sacred charge. At length Mrs. Wylder began to show favorable symptoms, and the doc- tor's hopes revived. He remained with-- her constantly from his first arrival until the tenth day, when she was decidedly better. He then returned home to look after his family, but came back the next day. Three weeks from the beginning of her illness, she was able to sit up in bed. Her first desire was to take her infant in her arms; for during this desolate period he was in- exile from that tender care which only a mother can bestow. It was in- deed a moving sight to witness. Could the unconscious babe have spoken, he would have said,-- "Dear mother, how changed you are! When you last kissed me, you wore a rich shawl and a fine velvet cap, just as you were going to take your first ride after my   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       281 birth. You were beautiful then, mother. Your eyes were bright and loving, your lips were rosy and sweet, and I felt your gentle breath as you stooped over my cradle to give me a parting kiss. From that time, mother, I have never seen you until now; and, had they told me it was you, I should never have believed it. Dear mother, why do you not look beautiful now? Why are your eyes sunken and dull, your cheeks hollow and pale, your lips disfigured, and you so different? When you used to stifle me with kisses, mother, and press me to your bosom, your breath was sweet as the perfume of the violet. Now it is like the odor of carrion. Surely the angel of death has touched you, mother, you look so feeble and sorrowful. Your hand trembles now, mother, and the tear glistens in your eye. You never trembled before when you held me; nor did I ever see -you weep until now, dear mother. I hope you will be like yourself again, mother, and your breath will again become sweet, your eyes bright, and your tresses will once more grow for me to play with when I put my arms around your neck, dear mother. When I get to be an angel, I will ask my Father in heaven to make you good and beautiful, that when death shall again touch you, dear mother, you will come to me where sweet voices sing, and where no more storms will make you cold and rob you of your bright eyes and balmy breath, dear mother." Mrs. Wylder recovered; but for more than a year she was hot her former self in appearance. Her infant son grew in strength, and became a merry prattler at her knee. In the mean time her  mother had chosen a name for him. and requested the parents to accept it as a personal favor to herself, to rescue from oblivion the name of a younger brother of hers, Cicero Randolph, who died within a year after graduating with the first honor at William and Mary College. Mr. and Mrs. Wylder were pleased with the name; and its adoption was thus notified to Mrs. Chilton:-- 24  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7248-00000142"/> 282       WILKINS WYDER; OR, "CURTIS LODGE, May 30, 18-. 4tDEAREST MOTHER:-You have been apprized at differ- ent times of the distressing illness through which I have lately passed. I am gradually acquiring strength, but am so changed in looks that you would not recognise me. My hair has all dropped off, and a new growth is coming out. You know what pretty teeth I had, and the pride I felt in displaying them when I could do so without betraying my vanity. I have been badly salivated, which indeed was the only thing that saved my life, Dr. Wylder says; but my beautiful teeth have become black, and many of them are loose in their sockets, so that it is probable they will have to be extracted, and a new set manufactured for me by the dentist. What a strange turn of fortune! Well, dear mother, it is said that all things happen for the best. For the life of me, however, I cannot see how the loss of my teeth can eventuate for good to any one, except to the dentist, who will charge a few hundred dollars for his work in substituting an artificial set. Sometimes I think I was too vain of 'this beautiful mouth-ornament, and that my teeth have been ruined to humble my pride. In this light I amn disposed to view the loss; and no longer to repine. My recent affliction has taught me many valuable lessons; and one is, to submit without murmuring to the will of Heaven. "Mr. Wylder is all that I could imagine or desire in the best of husbands. His affectionate tenderness to me is beyond description. He has wealth, and all the comforts which it can-procure. His parents are very kind to me: they treat me as a daughter. I am fearful that I shall not be able to visit you this summer, owing to my feeble con- dition and the length of the journey. It is possible that we may go to some mineral springs in this State to spend a few weeks. "We have bestowed on our little son the name you se- lected, Cicero Randolph. I can. just remember this dear   L" o V OA J CJl o ula lA IoUA  O - uncle when I was a child. He passed several weeks at your house, and was fond of making playthings for the children. Never until I became a mother did I know how to love any one who tried to make children happy. My uncle must have been a good young man. He used to sit on the sofa and read to you and father, but I do not know from what books. His voice was very solemn at times, ,and I know you wept. I shall take great pleasure in call- ing my son by his name, and only hope that he may pos- sess his genius and virtues. "Ever yours affectionately, MARIA WYDER." The future of this little child produced the deepest anxiety after Dr. Wylder made known to his son that his wife could never again become a mother. On the life of this tender infant depended the hopes of the Wylder name; for the other sons of Dr. Wylder had died in infancy or boyhood, and Wilkins was the only one of his children who could perpetuate his name, and the grandchild Cicero Randolph was the sole representative of Wylder Hall after its present owners should pass away. Mr. Wylder spent a few weeks at the Fount of Health (as a certain spring was called) in company with his wife, who derived benefit from its waters. The infant Cicero fattened like a pig, to the great joy of his parents. They returned home in cheerful spirits.  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7248-00000143"/> ;dQi      WILKINS WXLDER; OR, CHA PTER XXXTII. DURING the next ten years after the birth of Cicero Randolph, Mr. Wylder resisted all solicitations to accept office or to be a candidate. He applied himself wholly to his large planting-interests, and succeeded in doubling his property in value. His domestic affairs glided on smoothly, and there was no cloud over his happiness, except that Master Cicero was the only child born to him, as Dr. Wylder had predicted. Mrs. Wylder was somewhat dis- consolate from this cause, but, guided by the sentiment she had expressed to her mother, of submission to the will of Heaven, she dismissed the trouble from her mind. Master Cicero had now arrived at an age when his schooling should commence; for he was in his tenth year, and thus far had only been taught by his parents to read. Either a private tutor had to be employed, or the boy would have to be sent from home for his education, unless a sufficient school could be raised in the neighborhood to induce some qualified teacher to take charge of it. Mr. Wylder consulted freely with his wife on the subject, and also with his father. In his own experience he saw many arguments to. incline him to private tuition; but where could be found another Mr. Wells to perform the task to his satisfaction? Mrs. Wylder was opposed to sending her son from home, as she desired to watch over him for the sake of his morals and his health. At length Mr. Wylder concluded to build an academy on his own land, within a mile of his house, have it incorporated by the name of "4Randolph Academy," and make a donation of it to the trustees. This course was accordingly adopted, and the   school went into operation. Mr. Wylder paid five hundred dollars a year out of his own pocket to secure a good teacher. The proceeds of the school would thus be an object, and the trustees succeeded in placing Mr. James Russell, an experienced and able instructor of youth, at the head of the institution. As there was nothing unusual to notice in the manage- ment of the school, or in the progress of Master Cicero in his studies, the five years which he spent at the academy under the rigid discipline -of Mr. Russell will be passed over. He walked to school daily, taking his dinner with him in a tin bucket, as did the other boys. His disposi- tion was amiable, his mind sprightly, and his health good. All these advantages were united to a comely figure and handsome face,-which especially delighted his mother. Master Cicero was quite social, and frequently brought home other boys to spend the night with him, and also to hunt on Saturdays. These visits were returned by him, with the approbation of his parents; and in due time he became a popular boy not only among his schoolmates, but among the neighbors, whose acquaintance he formed with an easy and pleasant familiarity. As Mr. Wylder was the wealthiest man in that section, the cleverness of his- son was the more conspicuous. At the end of five years Mr. Russell told Mr. Wylder that his son had completed a full preparatory course and was ready to enter college. The question now to be settled was, Where should he be sent to receive the finish- ing-touch? Mrs. Wylder insisted that, as she had to be deprived of his society, she would prefer his entering William and Mary College, in Virginia, where his name. sake had been educated. He would then be within visiting- distance of his grandmother, Mrs. Chilton, who would bestow a guardian's care on him. This course was finally agreed to, with the consent of Dr. Wylder; and Master Cicero, fully prepared with money and letters, set  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7248-00000144"/> 286       WILKINS WYDER; OR, out to. reach the Old Dominion by public conveyance. He first reported himself to his grandmother, who had not seen him since he was five years old, when his parents paid her a visit. His appearance was gratifying to her family pride, and she was rejoiced to see so worthy a representative of the name of her brother. In a short time Cicero Randolph Wylder was enrolled among the students of William and Mary College. The trustees and faculty were gratified that the institution was patronized by so prominent a citizen of another State as the Hon. Wilkins Wylder, whose services in Congress and marriage in Virginia, as well as his own good qualities, had secured him general favor in the Mother of States. Some three months from the time his son entered college, Mr. Wylder thus wrote him:- "CURTIS LODGE, Jan. 25, 18-. "MY DEAR BoY:-Your pleasing letter has been read by us all. The account you give of your reception is very gratifying. I hope you will always have the favor of those with whom you associate, or whose duty it is to exercise a friendly supervision over your conduct and studies. By all means be civil and patient. You will have to encounter many things disagreeable not only in youth, but throughout manhood and old age, should you live to that period; and I beg you to cultivate a gentle and forgiving spirit, never treating as an insult what was not designed as such, and always doing little acts of accommodation. Should you be convinced, however, that gross disrespect was intended, such as honor requires you to notice, be firm in your demands for redress. This is the only way to preserve your self-respect, to say nothing of the good opinion of others. "In your expenses and manner of dress, I wish you to conform to the rules of the institution. Because I can afford to supply you with a great deal of money, it is no ; ;.      1   reason why you should desire to waste it on frivolous objects or to gratify the ambition for show so common to youth. As you have been informed at home, I was placed at ten years of age under a private tutor, in whose charge I remained until my eighteenth year. But I now see objections to that plan, the principal of whioh is that the youth is shut out from the society of his fellows, and grows up with only such knowledge of mankind as books impart,-a very unsafe criterion. I have been a close observer, and I am fully convinced that to under- stand men as they are we must ,deal with them face to face, and not through the deceptive medium of history, which pretends to reflect their character, but wholly fails to do so, either because the task is impossible, or the authors do not choose to bring themselves to the level of truth, lest their own abilities should appear common like those of other men. "You have daily round you members of the faculty,- students, citizens, and others,-in whom you see nothing parallel with the great men of history, but who, in fact, possess as many qualities to admire, and only need a his- torian to exaggerate them into wonders, and to stir the blood of future generations by relating what occurred under your own eye, and which you looked upon at the time as insipid, or at least undeserving of admiration. Of such fragments is history composed; and nothing but a peep behind the scenes would have convinced me of the fact. Still, I wish you to cultivate history and imitate the great models; but always bear in mind the secret I have divulged, and recollect that even the rolls of your college furnish names of as much intrinsic greatness as Greece or Rome ever boasted, with but few exceptions. These hints are disagreeable to us both, I know, and are given only to save you from delusion. "I will not, my dear son, exhaust your patience or fatigue your mind with further remarks at present to  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7248-00000145"/> 288       WILKINS WYDEtR OR, infdience your opinions of mankind. I wish you to judge frequently, as opportunities may allow, from living spe. bimens, and not altogether from the dead, who are made to speak and act on paper just as the whims, interest, or temerity of their biographers may dictate. Among- your school-fellows at the academy you have heard recited the caustic reply of young Mr. Pitt (afterward Earl of Chatham) to Sir Robert Walpole in the House of Com- mons. It is indeed a splendid piece of composition, not surpassed in the language by any off-hand effort of oratory, and never failed to bring down the applause of the spec- tators who assembled at the academy to witness your exhibitions. But it -has been ascertained that Dr. Johnson (then a fancy reporter) wrote this celebrated reply with- out having heard Mr. Pitt. ;So that this laurel is torn from the brow of the greatest of British orators, whose fame, happily, is too brilliant to suffer an eclipse from so trifling a discovery. There are many'noted" instances where speeches -have been ascribed to men who never made them, in Greece, in Rome, in Great Britain, and in the United States.- I wish you to cultivate a good style both in conversation and in writing, which may enable you to figure in history, if not as the subject, or in praise of yourself, at least in dressing up others to show your ability in composition. It is a noble branch of the Fine Arts, and withal a generous labor, taxing yourself to give celebrity to others and dispense happiness without the motive of personal reward.      - . "Possibly these reflections may be too graie for a college student, who delights in dreaming of the beau- tiful, and who would rather have the bright side always depicted.

'.         .?L .   . -J   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       289 Blessed in fortune and in his offspring, Mr. Wylder looked forward to a happy future. His political aspira- tions had been entirely satisfied. He was contented with his lot, and sought to improve agriculture by every method in his power, giving his experience occasionally to the public. The time was approaching for the nomination of a can- didate for Governor. Delegates had been appointed to a State Convention, and at length that body assembled. Several gentlemen were spoken of by their friends for the nomination. A number of ballotings took place without a choice having been made, and considerable feeling was manifested. To harmonize all interests, Mr. Grayson offered the following:- "Resolved,-That the Hon. Wilkins Wylder, of Franklin, be and is hereby nominated by the Graball party as their candidate for Governor of this State." The resolution was adopted by acclamation, and speeches were made strongly recommending him as worthy of support. Warm eulogies were pronounced upon his cha- racter, and Mr. Dorsey moved that the declaration of principles submitted by Mr. Wylder in the Legislature be adopted as the platform of the party. There was some difference of opinion on the propriety of this course, as Mr. Wylder had confessed that they were intended more as a burlesque on the usages of the party than for any other object. It was finally agreed that, whether the resolutions originated in good faith or in ridicule, it was proper that Mr. Wylder should haethem laid on his own shoulders, to carry as an ornament or as a burden. A committee was appointed to notify him of his nomination and to request his acceptance, and also to inform him that his resolutions in the Legislature had been adopted by the Convention as the   platform of the Graball party. The letter of the committee was in the following words:- T         25  &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7248-00000146"/> 290       WILKINS WYDER; OR, - STATESBvRG, June 10, 18-. "SIR:-Tbe agreeable duty has been assigned us to com- municate the fact of your nomination as a candidate for Governor, and to request your acceptance. You have herewith a copy of the resolutions adopted by the Legis- lature several years ago, which the Convention has endorsed as a tribute to your patriotism and sagacity. In perform- ing this duty, the undersigned beg to add their personal congratulations, and to express the hope that you will, at your earliest convenience, enable them to announce you as the candidate-bf the Graball party for the office of Go- vernor, the duties of which you are so well qualified to discharge usefully to your fellow-citizens. "We have the honor, &amp;c.     M. ASHFIELD, D. KORNEGAY, Hon. W1LKINS WYDER.        M. WILKINSON." These proceedings took Mr. Wylder by surprise, and he was at a loss in what light to consider them, whether as a genuine mark of confidence and respect, or as the only alternative to present a candidate to harmonize the party, which had been greatly divided in the Convention. Fur- thermore, he found his resolutions thrust into his face in a manner somewhat equivocal, and he could hardly reconcile it with a proper self-respect to ratify the nomination, with its encumbrances. He weighed the whole subject maturely, and called to his aid a train of reasoning which relieved his perplexities. There was a time, said Mr. Wylder to him- self, when the office of Governor was a splendid prize in my estimation, such as conferred the/highest honor on its incumbent. But of late years suc/low cunning and un- worthy practices have been resorted to in the selection of candidates, and the men who have been elected, with a few honorable exceptions, have been of such inferior capacity, compared to the best talents which might have been in- voked, that I no longer regard the office with the respect   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       291 which I once entertained. Really, were a hundred names of our prominent citizens, without regard to party lines, placed in a box, one could be drawn, as in a lottery, who would perhaps be a better man for the office than is usually presented by the intriguing caucuses or nominating con, ventions which have sprung up of late to govern the country. Even the Presidential office has lost much of its glory by this iniquitous system of wire-pulling and pie- bald platforms. I will accept the nomination, however, and give my reasons to the public. "CURTIS LODGE, June 15, 18-. "GENTLEMEN:-I am in receipt of your letter informing me of my nomination for Governor. For the civilities thus shown me, I return my grateful thanks. "Whether I should accept the honor-thus tendered, has been a matter of grave reflection with me. The Conven- tion was pleased to incorporate in its proceedings the reso- lutions which, at my instance, were adopted by the Legis- ,lature many years ago, and- I am called upon to abide my own work. Pardon me, gentlemen, if I avail myself of the occasion to trouble the public, through you, with my sentiments somewhat at length. "i1 will not review or repeat my former expressions in regard to party abuses, nor is it necessary to say to what extentI intended those resolutions as a corrective. It is enough for me that I am called upon by thd Graball party to be their standard-bearer in the a)pproaching contest for Governor, and that I have for my guide in the canvass a declaration of principles of my own framing. .Whether, as you kindly intimate, the platform was adopted as a 'tribute to my patriotism,' or not, is no very grave concern. Whatever the motive, I shall construe it in an accommo- dating spirit, just as my name was brought before the Con- vention to secure harmony, without reference to my fitness for the office. Thus actuated, I cannot do otherwise than  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7248-00000147"/> 292       WILKINS WYDER; OR, accept the nomination, with its accompanying platform, to every line of which, serious or playful, I subscribe as the rule of my conduct. 'tIt has been customary for candidates to avow their profound distrust of themselves for the Executive office. At an earlier day, before I knew the individuals who occu- pied the station, and their manner of performing its duties, I too should have given a similar vent to my modesty. But it is impossible for me to declare such humility, as there has been no example, since the Convention system has been inaugurated, of abilities or successful administra- tion which would renderfthe office embarrassing even to so moderate a capacity as I claim to possess. The only. troubles which alarm me in advance are those resulting from the timid manner in which the nominated incumbents have felt themselves bound to act, yielding to party com- mands in their appointments and policy, rather than incur the peril of exercising eir own judgments for the public good. With such precedents I cannot sympathize without surrendering my personal convictions,-which I hope will not be expected of me. M1y greatest anxiety, if elected, will arise from this source. "I beg to remind you, gentlemen, that I have no desire whatever to re-enter public life. My experience has created a strong disinclination to endure its trials for the sake of the empty rewards. There was a period when I looked upon reputation won in the public service as the height of noble desire. From causes which I decline spe- cifying in this communication, no such value attaches at the present time. The office of Governor has no attrac- tions for me; and, were I to consult my individual choice, I should remain at home, as an humble cultivator of the soil, rather than mingle in the strife of a political canvass, or incur the vexations of an office from which no incumbent has ever escaped.

ASHFIELD, A D. KORNEOAY   Committee." M. WILKINSON, This correspondence was published in all the newspapers of the State, and was commented upon by many journals at a distance as a specimen of frankness and independence rarely witnessed of late years. The "Expositor" noticed it in these terms:- "NOMNATION ACCEPTED.-The attention of our readers will necessarily be drawn to the letter of the committee appointed by the late Graball Convention, and the reply of Mr. Wylder, the nominee for Governor, to be found in 6ur columns to-day. While we forbear criticism on the letter of acceptance, as indulging a tone at variance with common usage on such occasions, we have only to remark that our better acquaintance with the nominee has recon- ciled us to the original and frequently startling positions which he assumes as a politician, or rather as a citizen who rises superior to party trammels in the exercise of official trusts. "We published the proceedings of the Convention last week, together with the platform it adopted, consisting of the resolutions offered by Mr. Wylder in the Legislature several years ago, which attracted general notice at the time. Since then he has been a Representative in Con- gress, and established for himself a high character for talents and patriotism. He declined being a candidate for re-election, preferring to remain at home to conduct his large planting-operations. He now obeys the call of his party at a sacrifice of his interests and feelings, in the hope that his example may prove beneficial to the State. We do not know who will be his competitor; but we are confident his superior could not be found at this juncture 25,  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7248-00000148"/> 294       WILKINS WYDEt; OR, of our affairs, and we deem his election sure, in the face of any opposition." The Growlers had been holding back their nomination of a candidate for Governor until the Graballs led off in the campaign. When the letter of. Mr. Wylder appeared, the Growlers held a consultation, and decided to bring for- ward no candidate to oppose a man of such boldness and honesty of purpose. In the next issue of the organ of that party, the editor said:-  "NO NOMNATION.-The letter of Mr. Wylder accepting Athe nomination for Governor, tendered by the Graball party, appears in our columns to-day. The opportunity is seldom afforded of reading such a document. We admire its lofty tone, which is in keeping with the resolutions offered by the same gentlemen several years ago in the Legislature, which have contributed more than all other causes united to bring the Graball professions into disre- pute, and to weaken the confidence of the people in artful paper contrivances to impose on their understandings merely to obtain their votes. We think Mr. Wylder's letter gives the finishing-blow to all such dishonest effrontery. "We have reason to believe that Mr. Wylder was nomi- nated as a compromiseindidate, to save the feelings of the several aspirants who stood a number of ineffectual ballot. ings in the Convention, as his weight of character would give plausibility to the nomination. This was all that was expected. If the secret wishes of the Convention could be ascertained, it would no doubt appear that his election was not much desired, if in fact the hope was not indulged that the opposing party would have him beatel^by one of their strongest men, and thus he would be properly rebuked for throwing firebrands into the Graball camp thich un- settled the ancient usages of the party beyond t e power of restoration. This, we verily- believe, was the real motive which placed his name before the public. "Feeling no apprehension of defeat, whether Mr. Wyldee   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       295 or any other standard-bearer led the Graball forces into battle, the Growlers have resolved to testify their admira- tion of an honest man, such as they conceive Mr. Wylder to be, by declining to make any nomination for Governor, and thus leave the Graballs to run over the course alone, with our congratulations at the fair prospect they have of being totally dispersed by the incoming administration, which will rise above all party prejudice that for years has been the aliment as it has been the blemish of Graball Governors. It is expected that each member of the Growler party will bestow or withhold his vote as he may deem most satisfactory to himself. On this subject no re- commendation is given either way." Of course Mr. Wylder was elected Governor, and it only : remained for him to be officially notified, after the Legis- lature had counted the votes and declared the result. CHAPTER   XXXIV. THE Legislature convened on Monday, and on the fol- lowing day the Governor transmitted all the returns made from the several counties to the Executive Department, of the election for Governor. On notice being given, the Senate attended in the Representative Hall, and the pre- siding officers, in presence of both Houses, counted the votes, and thereupon the Hon. Wilkins Wylder was pro- claimed duly elected Governor of the State for the next term of two years. A joint committee was appointed to wait upon and inform him of his election, and to know when it would be his pleasure to take the oath of office. The committee called upon him at the hotel in the discharge of their duty. He informed them that at meridian the next day he would attend at the Capitol for the purpose of entering on the duties of the office. , X,  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7248-00000149"/> 296       WILKINS WYDER; OR, On receiving the report, the Legislature appointed a joint committee of arrangements, who issued a programme of the ceremonies of inauguration. At eleven o'clock the galleries of the Representative Chamber were filled by the ladies, who always give an interest to such occasions. The lobbies were also filled by a dense crowd of spectators, all anxious to see and hear the Governor elect, who from his singular merit was permitted to obtain the office without a competitor. At half-past eleven o'clock, Mr. Wylder was waited upon at his lodgings by the committee of arrange- ments, and escorted to the Executive Chamber, whrere Governor Brooks gave him a friendly reception. They conversed together until the procession was formed, when, as the clock struck twelve, leaning on the arm of the retiring Governor, and supported by the committee of arrangements, he entered the Representative Hall. The Senate having attended, and the members of the Judiciary and other invited characters being present, Mr. Wylder rose from the Speaker's chair, and delivered the following INAUGURAL ADDRESS. "FELLOW CITIZENS :-The circumstances under which I appear before you to take upon myself the obligations of your Chief Magistrate excite my profoundest gratitude. For the first time in the history of the State has a can- didate ever been permitted to obtain the office without competition. My heart is deeply penetrated by this signal proof of the public favor. I am conscious, however, that it has been owing more to the belief that I would administer the Government impartially, than to the con- viction on the part of my countrymen that I was the most capable among them to guide the ship of state. "As to the measures which I may recommend to your consideration, I shall say but little in advance. When I look at the masses of the people, and see their want of education, I am inclined to press their claims upon you   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       297 by an earnest appeal to your sympathies, if you cannot be otherwise induced to perform a duty the most absolute which can devolve on their Representatives. May I not declare in this presence, and with all respect for the intelligence and patriotism by which I am surrounded, that, unless the voters of the country are enlightened, Gov- ernment is the veriest bauble, which may indeed amuse and benefit those who pretend to administer its functions; but the people, who pay the expense and fight our battles, have no share whatever in the blessing. They must be qualified to know their individual rights, and public obligations. This can be done only by infusing light into their minds. By nature we are all equally ignorant; and those of us whose good fortune it has been to receive cul- ture, and to have a new world opened to our minds, are bound by every tie of humanity to provide for those who, from poverty or other cause, cannot partake of the fruits of knowledge. Have you not been grieved and mortified to see thousands of your fellow-citizens come to the ballot. box without the ability to read the tickets which had been furnished them? I hope you will cheerfully co-operate with the Executive in maturing a system of Public Edu- cation which shall forever banish this reproach from our State. "With regard to works of internal improvement, nothing need be said. Our predecessors have wisely occupied the whole field, and have left us nothing better to do than to execute the plans which they have marked out for us. We shall endeavor, I trust, to justify their expectations in this regard. "The most delicate of all topics yet remains to be touched upon,-revenue from  taxation. There is no de- ficiency which calls for an increase of rates; nor is there any surplus beyond the necessary expenditures which would authorize a diminution. Whatever you may judge best in raising and applying revenue for the public good  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7248-00000150"/> 298       WJLKTNS WYDER; OR, will satisfy me, unless I should be convinced that sufficient cause existed for withholding my official sanction. In such case, my reasons'will be laid before you. "I have already said enough; but desire to add a few observations relative to appointments to office which may devolve on me. I never concurred in the doctrine that the public offices were spoils accruing to the victors alone. They were created for the benefit of the people, and not as the reward of selfishness or ambition. When it may be necessary to fill a vacancy, my aim will be to select the most competent and suitable person, regardless of his political opinions. I could not preserve my self- respect, or look my constituents in the face, on any other principle. ; "Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representa- tives :-From this hour we sustain to each other a very responsible relation, forming two of the three departments of Government. May we act justly to all, and devote our energies to the public service, instead of distracting our attention by petty strifes and jealousies. - Animated by such motives, we cannot fail to obtain the :approbation of our constituents and the respect of the world," There was a burst of applause at the conclusion of the address. Mr. Wylder then turned to the President of the Senate, and took the oath prescribed by law, after which he was escorted by ex-Governor Brooks and the com- mittee of arrangements to the Executive office, of which he formally took charge, and the pageant of inauguration was over. As all State occasions excite general interest, it may be necessary to introduce the remarks of the editor of the "(Expositor" on the late change in the Executive:- "On Wednesday last a new administration was ushered into existence. Governor Brooks, who had served his term faithfully, has retired to private life, and Governor Wylder manages the ship of state. We trust his official   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       299 career will be as successful as his fortunes have been in time past. He' is really one of the great men of the age. Somewhat reserved in his manners, he appears at first view to be a little austere; but the impression soon fades on acquaintance. He has true dignity of-character, and is one of the most laborious men of the day, trying to infuse into the mass of his countrymen a degree -of in- tellectual light and moral elevation, without which there can be no public happiness. He has accepted office with- out seeking it, and has before him a quiet future, with the confidence and good wishes of all parties to cheer his official conduct. "The ceremonies of inauguration passed off in the best style. Mr. Parsons, the polished chairman of the com- mittee of arrangements, acquitted himself with all praise. We would attempt to describe the array of fashion and beauty present, and the festivities of the ball-room at night, if we felt capable of doing justice to the occasion; but we are conscious of our inability in this- respect, and therefore must decline the attempt. There was a large concourse of visitors to witness the inauguration, and we have heard but one sentiment expressed among them all. in regard to the new Governor; and that is of unqualified approbation of his inaugural address and the manner of its delivery. We shall expect much good fruit from the action of Governor Wylder, who has an atmosphere of freedom to breathe which never before exhilarated the blood of any Chief Magistrate,-as nearly all his predecessors have, been strict party-men, wielding their power for party objects. The present Executive is not hampered by any such feel- ings or obligations."- Governor Wylder was waited upon by the members of the Legislature, and others, to pay their individual respects and to assure him of the satisfaction they experienced from the pledge he had given of rising superior to party instincts. They all seemed to imbibe something of his  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7248-00000151"/> 300       WILKINS WYDER; OR, noble spirit, and to feel ashamed of their former excess in party warfare, when they converted the Government into a mere machine to grind toll for the victors. They expressed the hope that the reignr of such absurdity was over, and that an honest reform had been commenced, never to- cease until the error had been permanently corrected. Governor Wylder listened respectfully, and ex- pressed his gratification that the course he had marked out for himself was likely to receive public favor. The first communication he made to the Legislature, within a few days after entering upon the office, was as follows:-- 4' EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, NOV. 15, 18-. "To THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. "In order to give you time for reflection, and for adopt- ing suitable measures to carry the plan into effect should you approve it, I have concluded to submit my views to you thus early on the subject of Public Education. My opinions are the result of much careful investigation, and, whether I shall be sustained by your concurrence or not, I place them on record for what they are worth. "No scheme of public utility can be accomplished with- out a responsible agent; and the more concentrated and direct the responsibility, the more certain will be the suc- cess. The idea is erroneous that the efficiency of any measure is augmented by the number of minds to execute it. I shall endeavor to explain my meaning fully as I pro- ceed to unfold the plan. "Let there be a Director of Public Education elected by your body, the term of office being ten years, unless sooner removed by the Governor on the recommendation of the General Assembly, or the office shall be discontinued. The salary should be liberal, say five thousand dollars per annum, and the director should reside at the seat of Go- vernment, with full discretion as he may- perceive the ne- cessity after visiting every county and neighborhood in   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       301 the State. The whole landscape could be thus taken into view, and the director could shape his action to suit each lo- cality. In some places the population might be too scatter- ing to admit a school, or, if any, only one on a small scale; whilst in other situations the number of children might re- quire a larger school, or a number of schools, to be supplied with teachers such as the director might select, and their compensation to be fixed by agreement. "The director should keep a statement of the number of children between six and fifteen years of age, so far as he can ascertain them  in his visits,-the condition of each neighborhood as to morals and intelligence; and he should write down the address of suitable persons with whom he may correspond, from  time to time, in order to carry out his scheme. "By this method the director will be enabled to decide what stimulants or aid he may best apply, as circumstances dictate. Some  neighborhoods may be isolated from all lines of travel, locked in by mountain barriers, or by the, higher walls of ignorance. Those will demand pictorial instruction, for which purpose the director should always have with him a variety of engravings, representing neat cottages, the figures of improved breeds of stock, snug schoolhouses, flower-yards, and other objects to excite curiosity and the desire of knowledge. My views on this subject may be found on the journal of the House of Re- presentatives several years ago; and I beg to refer to them as a  part of my system, without troubling you with repe- tition. "I would have the director clothed with power to carry the torch of education into every part of the State, so that no family or  individual should 'be left in the dark. For -the first year the sum of twenty thousand dollars might be placed under his control, to be expended for books or such prints as he may order for circulation; and after one year's experiment on this scale, he should report his proceedings 26  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7248-00000152"/> 802       WTLKINS WYDER; OR, to the Executive, either to be condensed, or laid before you entire, for your consideration. You would thus have lights to guide you, and either to increase or abandon the project as you might deem necessary. "In regard to the director personally, I would have him to possess the very highest qualifications for his officei not only as to learning, morals, and experience, but I would require that patience and urbanity so essential to impress the people in his favor. Without this influence, his labors would be wholly in vain. And, in return for these qualities actively exerted, I would have his official rank equal to any in the State, so that he might be everywhere received with deference and be free from the restraint of subordination. A man of the right stamp would establish an imperishable name for himself, and kindle a new element conducive to our national glory and individual happiness. W. -WYDER.'- This message was referred to a select committee of five who reported a bill embodying the Executive recommenda tions. It passed the House of Representatives, but did nol reach the Senate until a late period of the session, and wa lost among the unfinished business. Governor Wylder re gretted the failure of his project, but had the satisfactioi of knowing that he had done his duty. Enough has been sketched, without enlarging on othe measures of the Governor. The session closed in harmony and there was nothing unpleasant to remember betwee the two Departments. About six months had elapsed from his inauguratio when Governor Wylder was informed of the extreme il ness of his mother; and he forthwith repaired to Wylde Hall. On his arrival, she was merely able to recognif him; and, after a tender parting with the family, this exce lent lady yielded up her spirit to its Creator. This wi the first grief which Governor Wylder had known tinl si    THE SUCCESS'UL MAN.       303 the death of his aunt, Mrs. Ringford, many years before. The two sisters repose side by side in the family burying- ground. Dr. Wylder was overwhelmed by the blow. lie told his son that he felt his own days drawing rapidly to a close, and that he wished him to prepare a will and take it in charge. In a few days an attorney was sent for, who drew the will, and it was executed in due form. Dr. Wylder had but two children living,--the Governor, and a married daughter, Mrs. Carson. He owned about three hundred slaves, and extensive settlements of land, a large part of which was in a high state of improvement. Dr. Wylder made a number of small bequests, among which was one of ten thousand dollars to the Rev. Ezra Holton; one thou- sand dollars to an old widow, Mrs. Hubert, who lived near him, and whose poverty and goodness rendered her name sacred in the neighborhood. An infirm old man, David Craft, who used to bring fish to Dr. Wylder, was also re- membered in the like sum of one thousand dollars. For many years these two aged people had been assisted to live by their generous benefactor. It was quite an affect- ing scene to behold a man of Dr. Wylder's liberality and high-toned character taking leave of the world, as he seemed to do by his testamentary paper, in the midst of his great affliction. Governor Wylder made a visit to his own residence and saw that every-thing was managed correctly. He felt that he had made a sacrifice of his inte- rest and repose to reside at the seat of Government. Still, he was too sound a patriot to refuse serving his country when called upon, and the inconvenience ceased to annoy him. On his return to the capital, he found several important letters awaiting him, one of which was from the Secretary of War, in relation to the public arms and the organized strength of the militia; one from the British Consul at Havana, inquiring about certain Colonial records; another from the Governor of an adjoining State, demanding a fugi-  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7248-00000153"/> 304       WILKINS WYDER; OR, tive from justice; and still another from a Judge of the Supreme Court, announcing the resignation of his office. He at once appointed the Hon. Robert Henderson, a dis- tinguished jurist of Growler politics, to fill the vacancy. In the next "Expositor" the following paragraph ap- peared :- "EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENT.- We learn that Governor Wylder has filled the vacancy on the Supreme Court Bench, caused by the resignation of Judge Lockwood, by the, ap- pointment of the Hon. Robert Henderson, of Woodville. The selection will no doubt please- the Bar, as an able jurist is called to preside over their cases; but, as the retiring judge was a member of the Graball party, and the Governor himself of the like affinities, it was expected by his political friends that he would at least preserve the influence of his party, if he could not strengthen it by his appointments to -office under the rule laid down in his inaugural. But we are convinced that his motives are wholly disinterested and such as do honor to his sagacity and firmness." CFHAP'TER X XXV. IN his annual message Governor Wylder recommended liberal appropriations for public schools and for works of internal improvement. He considered these the substratum on which the prosperity of the State rested. His views were sustained by the Legislature, and provision made to realize the benefits he anticipated. The time for which he was elected having expired, he was glad to devote him- self to agriculture, the safest and happiest of all human pursuits. In a short time, however, he was called upon to endure the severest trials. His son had returned from Virginia, suffering from the effects of an accident. He had been bathing with several of his college-mates, and quite a   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       305 competition sprang up among them to pass certain rapids in the stream. Without knowing of any rocks in the descent, except such as appeared above water, young Wylder selected a channel different from the rest, in which, borne rapidly by the current, he was precipitated against a concealed rock, which bruised his shoulders and breast in a severe manner. On returning to the college, he was taken suddenly ill, discharged a quantity of blood from his lungs, and was several weeks under medical treatment. Expressing a desire to be with his parents, he was com- mitted to the care of his uncle, Lieutenant Chilton, who accompanied him to Curtis Lodge. Governor Wylder and his wife received their son with all affection, but were inexpressibly pained at his emaciated state and the serious nature of his injury. Dr. Wylder was immediately sent for, who found it difficult to repress the agony  of his mind on beholding the sad spectacle before him.  His favorite grandchild, the only being on whom his hopes centred to transmit his name to another generation, was an incurable invalid, not far from the grave. He saw that there was no chance of recovery, and, with a broken heart, so informed the parents of the dying youth.  Mrs. Wylder was so overcome by the shock that she took to her bed and refused all consolation. It was impossible, she said, to give up her noble son, just as he had bloomed into graceful manhood.   Governor Wylder bore his grief with more fortitude, hoping that his example would sustain his wife. The only person calm was the sufferer himself. He dis- coursed with his parents on the prospects before him when he entered college; of his ambitious aims, his toil to win the honors of his class; the kind treatment he had received from the faculty and his college-companions; the hopes of his grandmother, expressed in her letters to him, that he would some day render the name of CICERO RANDOLPH exalted among men; and, above all, the pleasing thought, U 261&amp;  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7248-00000154"/> 306       WILKINS WYDER; OR, after'-graduation, of returning home to enjoy the society of his parents and the love of his grandfather. Those sweet visions had occupied his mind; and he was soon to die without realizing them. The dying youth gave satis- factory evidence that he had reflected on a future life, beyond the grave,. and had made his peac6 with Heaven. Two months passed, and the sufferer was relieved from his affliction. Death had taken him away under circum- stances of peculiar solemnity. He was the only represent- ative of Wylder Hall after its aged tenant should leave. Governor Wylder had placed all his happiness in the for- tunes of his only child, whom he had raised so carefully and who gave promise of a bright and successful future. At the age of eighteen years, this prop of his house and idol of his affections was called from all the advantages which the best literary culture, a manly genius, and great wealth could bestow. The Rev. Mr. Holton, quite advanced in years, visited the family in their distress, and soothed their grief by many comforting appeals. The youthful scholar and cherished son was buried by the side of -his grand- mother, who had preceded him only a few years. A fine marble mnonument, some twenty feet high, was erected over his grave, with the simple inscriptioni "Cicero Ran- dolph Wylder, aged 18 years: The Last Hope of his Family." r   A I  W .U , .SUM AVAAi.' I e JV  CRTAPTER XXXVI. THE grief which had darkened his life in the loss of his only child showed itself most visibly in the conduct of Governor Wylder. With the exception of weekly visits to his father, with whom he and his wife usually spent the Sabbath, he remained at home, sadly brooding over his bereavement. Mrs. Wylder was even still more afflicted in her mind, as she had less occupation to divert her thoughts from the great sorrow. Her feelings were ex- pressed in the following letter to her mother in Vir- ginia:;- "CURTIS LODGE, April 14, '18--. "MY DEAREST MOTHES:--Our distress you have heard before now. I find it impossible to bear the calamity which has overtaken us in the death of Cicero, our last hope. I cannot resign the dear boy. His image is con- stantly before me as I first beheld it in infancy, and as I last saw his classical features in early manhood, cold and passionless in death! Utterance is denied me. I cannot even weep. Oh that a flood of tears would extinguish the burning emotions which consume my spirit I -I shall soon sleep by his side. My heart is broken, never to be comforted on earth. I pray to Heaven for strength to bear my trouble until I can prepare for an exchange of worlds. "I have much to say, dear mother, as it is probably the last time I shall address you; but I am unfitted for the task. I should like to send messages of love to all the family and to many dear old associates in Virginia. Power is denied me.* To you my first obligations are due;  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7248-00000155"/> OO       WILKINS WYDER; OR, and I thank you for all the tenderness with which you have treated me. Your once gay and ambitious daughter is now a poor, helpless thing, in the midst of wealth and honor. Perhaps I had as little cause to complain as any being that ever lived, until my child was taken from me. Now I have no desire to linger behind. My noble boy is in heaven, and I long to join him there. "When in health, I used to promise myself to write freely to my kindred and friends at a distance, giving them a true picture of my condition, and of the happiness which had fallen to my lot as a wife and mother. I deferred the task too long. I am now wholly unable to execute it, and I barely have strength to write this brief farewell to you, dearest mother, hoping that in a better world we shall be united with the loved ones who have gone before us. God bless you! "Your affectionate and dying daughter, -MARIA CHLTON WYDER." Her prophecy was soon verified. In less than two months from the date of her letter, the disconsolate mother was laid in the grave by the side of her son. It often happens that families of the highest rank and of a long career of prosperity are visited by a succession of disasters which impress vanity on all human efforts. Death, however, is not a misfortune at all times. Dr. Wylder and his son had filled their stations with fidelity, and the closing scene was at hand. They had never departed from the strictest personal honor, nor had they ever oppressed a human being. On all proper occasions they had exhibited a generosity of character which had been well appreciated. Success brad been their motto; and most abundantly had they realized it, in fortune and in, reputation. It was therefore no calamity to them that the ownership should cease. The ties which made life desirable had been severed. Proud and aristocratic as he ,   was, Dr. Wylder yielded to his fate without a murmur. His soul had been humbled by the Divine chastening. When he attended the burial of his daughter-in-law, and saw her placed beside his only grandchild that bore the family name, he had no wish to survive the wreck of his hopes. Within twelve months another grave was opened, e and all that was mortal of Dr. Andrew Wylder was con- signed to the earth, next to the ashes of his wife, who had several years reposed in this home of the dead. The will of Dr. Wylder was produced, and the sole executor, Governor Wylder, was qualified. The estate was estimated at four hundred thousand dollars, consisting of about three hundred slaves, twenty thousand 'acres of land, and the perishable property attached to the planta- tion. There were specific legacies amounting to fifty thousand dollars; after which the residue was equally divided between Governor Wylder and his sister, Mrs. Carson, of Hampton. The executor at once paid over the legacies. Mr. Carson received his share of the estate, which made him a wealthy man, giving him a high social position, to which his talents and good qualities fully entitled him. An order was given for the erection of a large monu- ment over the remains of Dr. Wylder, to commemorate his virtues. Suitable gravestones had been placed over all the dead at Wylder Hall. Having seen these completed to his satisfaction, Governor Wylder selected a spot for his own burial, by the side of his wife. He had a presenti- ment that he was not to survive long, and despatched his carriage for the Rev. Mr. Holton, the aged pastor and friend of the family, to attend him in his distress. The pious minister lost no time in consulting with his patron. The conversation was in substance as follows:- Gov. Wylder.--"I am truly thankful to see you once more, perhaps for the last time, Mr. Holton. My heart is so stricken that my bodily strength is failing daily, and I  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7248-00000156"/> 310       WILKINS WYDER; OR, must soon die. You have been the warm friend of my family since my earliest recollection, have baptized all my father's children, and my departed son; and you have also performed the funeral rites of my parents, and of my wife and child, and other members of the domestic circle who slumber in the graveyard at Wylder Hall. I wish to communicate to you certain intentions which I have never yet breathed to any one." Mr. Holton.-"I beg that you will regard me at your service, and though, from our respective ages and physical condition, you seem the most likely to survive me, I will receive what you have to say, and promise to comply with your request, which I feel persuaded will be consistent Ma ith my duties as a Christian." Gov. Wylder.-"As it respects my future after death, I am at peace with God and man, and have no fear, thanks to your counsel in my tribulation. But in regard to my property and the best use to be made of it, I desire to confer with you, that, in case my views are defeated by accident, you can witness to what I shall unfold. "I have been sadly disappointed in life, and wish to miti- gate, so far as I am able, the sorrows- of other people, know- ing what many have to endure from  misfortune or a wrong estimate'of things. My errors of opinion have been most extraordinary. Men have proved far more selfish and disgusting than I had imagined possible. For the credit of the race, I have found a few bright excep- tions, and only a few. I will not specify defects here. In my public life I have frequently alluded to them, but never with the freedom and force to make the impressions which I desired. However, let this topic pass. "My nearest relative is a sister, who is amply provided for in the goods of life, together with her children who may follow. By adding a half-million to their property- as I should do if my estate passed into their hands--their happiness would not be increased, and there might possibly   be danger of exciting a kind of purse-pride among them, which, to say the least, is a very contemptible weakness. I have determined, therefore, to give another direction to ,the wealth which it has pleased Heaven to commit to my stewardship. The plan is to be given in my last will and testament, which I intend to prepare and execute. At present I will merely observe that all my property is to be converted into a fund, the interest of which is to establish and maintain in perpetuity an institution to be called The Home for the Friendless, with buildings, grounds, and every thing suitable to alleviate the miseries of the unfortunate. The inmates are to enjoy all the comforts that can be pro- cured by large contracts for furniture, clothing, and provi- sions, to be managed by proper agents. Incidentals are to come in as experience may require. Persons of cultivated minds are to be assigned 'Reading Quarters,' which shall be well supplied with books. Periodicals and newspapers are to be spread in a proper hall for general use. There shall be a chapel connected with the establishment, for public worship, free to all Christian denominations, with a regular pastor to be paid out of the fund. None but per- sons of sober habits at the -time can be admitted, unless the attending physician shall deem a reform possible under his curative treatment. "An interest of six per cent. on the fund will yield thirty thousand dollars per annum. The managers are- to be chosen as the Legislature may prescribe in the act of in- corporation, the leading features of which shall be specified in my will. I shall lose no time in maturing this design and placing it in a shape beyond casualty. My heart is in the work, and I pray that it may prove a blessing to thou- sands of my race. I have always felt a desire to help the distressed. So active were my sympathies that I often felt condemned in partaking of the plenty I had without sharing it with the poor. A woman or child in rags, or, indeed, any form of suffering poverty, always pained my  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7248-00000157"/> 312       WILKINS WYDER; OR, feelings. If I could scatter my estate among such so as to produce the greatest good, I would cheerfully make that disposition of it. I regard myself simply as a trustee for others, and all my accumulation has only furnished me with food and clothing. I have consumed nothing else for my individual comfort, and it is all that I desire : it is all that I can enjoy, except when I give to others who need as- sistance."  Mr. Holton.-- The use for which you design your wealth will meet the favor of angels and men. I thank you for this conversation. Should it please Heaven to prolong my life until your testamentary disposition is perfected, it will be a source of melancholy pleasure to me that I heard from your lips the first enunciation of the plan. At all events, I should like to see the principle carried out by other men of fortune after your example, and I think it will be to your praise with distant generations in having originated the idea." Gov. Wylder.--"What I have confided to you in relation to The Home for the Friendless, I beg that you will not men- tion until after my death. To-morrow I shall send a mes- senger to Mr Judkins, the attorney at Hillburg, to visit me on special business. He shall then be instructed to draw my will with all necessary details to answer the object I have declared, in providing for the unfortunate. I have witnessed so much cruelty and injustice toward men who have failed in business, or who have otherwise experienced reverses, including some of the best minds in the country, that I wish to furnish a retreat where they can escape the sneers of the thoughtless multitude. I labor under a doubt even to this day whether the favor I have received from men has been a tribute to my individual merit or has resulted from the influence of my wealth. I am rather inclined to believe that if I had been poor, no discovery would have been made of abilities entitling me to the high public employments which I have filled. I  I   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.      313 grieve that such is the obliquity of human judgment. Thousands of wise and worthy men are neglected, while rich fools are advanced to great dignities by the world. For myself, if I deserved any respect whatever, it was for my personal qualities, which I had some agency Mi culti-. vating; none for my wealth, which was given to me by others. "If I had any taste for authorship, my first work should bring about, if possible, an improved state of public feel- ing on this subject. But you, Mr. Holton, have seen enough of poor human nature in its worst and best forms to sympathize with my conclusion. You have seen the good trampled under foot, and the undeserving promoted. I leave the solution of this mystery to the all-wise Creator. My heart has bled a thousand times at the unkindness of man to his fellow. I rejoice that I shall soon cease to wit- ness the disagreeable sight. My soul longs for purer com- panionship than I have been able to enjoy in this life. Even the tenderest relations have their alloy." Mr. Holton.--"Your discourse, Governor Wylder, emi- nently becomes a man in your condition. God alone knows how soon you may be called to mingle your dust with that of your parents, your wife and child at Wylder Hall; I hope you are fully prepared for death." Here Governor Wylder rose from his seat, and took from his library a copy of Bishop Taylor's "4Holy Living and Dying," and, presenting it to Mr. Holton, begged that he would accept it as a token of his friendship. It had been of great service in directing his thoughts in the proper channel, and had proved a source of urnspeakable comfort. With tears tricklin/g down his time-worn face, Mr. Holton received 'the volume, with the autograph presentation, which he was-glad to possess. Here the interview closed. Governor Wylder immediately addressed a note by- a servant to Mr.'Judkins, requesting his company the next day on business; but it turned out that this gentleman 27  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7248-00000158"/> 314       WILKINS WYDER; OR- was attending court at a distancefor the defence of a man who was indicted for stabbing another in a drunken frolic at the general election, and would not be at home under ten -days. The anxiety of mind which preyed upon Go- vernor0Wylder from his bereavement, and also from the testamentary disposition on which he had fixed his heart for the establishment of The Home for the .Friendless, with the-happy results which were to follow, had excited his nervous system to such a degree as to produce fever. When Mr. Judkis arrived, he saw at a glance that his client was not in a condition to dictate so important a paper as the one he intended, with the specifications ne- cessary to render the plan intelligible. He remained with him two days, in the hope of improvement; but the attend- ing physicians said there was no probability of a change for the better, and Mr. Judkins returned home without drawing the will. Governor Wylder sank into a lethargy, which continued until his death, within thirty hours after the attorney left him. And thus died Wilkins Wylder, one of the most useful and virtuous men of his time, before he had reached the grand climacteric of life. In one sense he had experienced eminent success, realizing his early motto. He had large wealth at his command, and he earnestly desired to bestow it for the good of his race. The reflections of the Rev. Mr. Holton were so judicious, that very little' more will be added after introducing the words of the venerable pastor at the funeral:- "To-day, my friends, we consign to the tomb, there to repose until the final resurrection, the body of our dis- tinguished fellow-citizen, Governor Wylder. Most of you who now gaze upon his coffin knew him well,-his urbane and generous nature, and the fidelity with which he dis, charged his public trusts. But there is one light in which it was my privilege alone to understand him, and on this   THE SUCCESSFUL MAN.       815 topic I beg to detain you a few moments in justice to his memory. "A few days before his last illness I paid him a visit, in the course of which he informed me of his design to provide a 'Homefor the Friendless,' by the testamentary disposition of his estate, valued at half a million of dollars. ile spoke of his sister and her children as having abundance of property for all rational objects, and th'at he felt so much for the unfortunate classes of his fellow-,men that he desired to do something for their relief. For this pur- pose he intended to establish an institution, with ample buildings, grounds, and support, to be conducted under an act of incorporation which should specify the proper details to carry out his design. To lose no time in the matter. he sent a written request to Mr. Judkins, the eminent lawyer of Hillburg, to visit him on business. That gentleman was unfortunately absent from home in the discharge of his professional duties, and when he returned, in some ten days -afterward, Governor Wylder was too seriously ill to dictate the testamentary framework. His condition be- came worse until he died, and this splendid benevolence failed! "I trust you will pardon a brief commentary which I desire to make in no unkindness -to the dead, but for the benefit of the living. When Governor Wylder was first a candidate for the Legislature, in his twenty-second year, lie so far complied with the erroneous custom of the day as to give public treats in the election. It was indeed a poor compliment to voters; yet he honestly believed that lie could not be successful without this mode of canvass- ing. As a friend, I suggested to hin the immoral tendency of such a practice. He continued it, however; and it was by means of a half-gallon of whiskey which he gave to a poor creature who asked him for it, that a gross murder was committed. Mr. Judkins was the temperance can- didate, and was defeated by Mr. Wylder. On the trial of  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7248-00000159"/> the murderer, .Mr. Judkins displayed such ability that his fame as a criminal lawyer was from that time established. He was often retaiined in cases at a distance; and itwas on precisely such an occasion-a crime committed under the influence of strong drink at an election-which took Mr. Judkins from home when Governor Wylder sent for him to prepare his will, bequeathing a half-million of dollars to the noble causemI have stated. "How mysterious are the dealings of Providence! When Just escaped from his minority, and ambitious of public honors, Mr. Wylder triumphed over Mr.; Judkins, his worthy rival for thd Legislature, and that triumph was secured by strong drink, poisoning the bodies and souls of men. An event growing out of the very means of his defeat led Mr. Judkins to distinction and wealth. Some thirty years afterward, when Governor Wylder had run his successful career, and, the owner of great possessions, wished to consecrate them to the cause of humanity, he sought the skill of his temperance rival to give his designi 3eeurity against judicial interference; but, from the con. iequences of the half-gallon jug, Governor Wylder failed to )btain the aid of Mr. Judkins, and thus the 'cHome for the Friendless,' so munificiently endowed, never rose in its pro- ortions of stone and mortar, meat, drink, and lodging, ibrary, flower-yards, and other appliances, to render kappy, if possible, a large class of men who had been rushed by misfortune and their spirits wounded by the, old selfishness of the world. "Thus we have a noted example, my friends, of the onsequences of error after a long interval, and through tany scenes terminating in success, so far as means extend, ut ending in failure when those means are to be made roductive of the greatest good. There is a moral in the story of Governor Wylder which it would be well for hers to remember when tempted in the same way. He se high in the world's favor, and died a Christian ; but    the crowning glory of his life was prevented by a trifle, and yet who shall venture to call sin a trifle, or to deny the retributive justice of the Almighty in his dealings with men, even to the defeat of their cherished benefactions? The first error of Mr. Wylder was in furnishing the means of intoxication to men who, to the shame of Government, are weak enough to cast their votes from unworthy in- fluences; but, as if to compensate society, good sprang out -of evil when Mr. Judkins was elevated in the popular scale, and to-day his manly grief is no less than ours as we commit 'dust to dust and ashes to ashes,' by depositing in the grave the body of the wise and virtuous Governor Wylder, of whom we have taken our last earthly farewell." Mr. Carson succeeded to the whole estate. He wrote to Lieutenant Chilton, in Virginia, that one hundred slaves, equal in value to those received by Governor Wylder as the marriage-portion of his wife, together with the money paid him, were subject to his order, as he did not feel willing to retain the property that came from Virginia, after the death of all the parties to whom it justly belonged. The Chiltons thanked Mr. Carson for his generous offer, but declined accepting the boon. They deemed Governor Wylder worthy of their confidence and love, and they could riot entertain the idea of receiving back what had been so icheerfully delivered to him on the family alliance, even though he had ceased to control it. They requested Mr. Carson to send one of his sons to Virginia, in whom they might trace the lineaments of their deceased relative by marriage, and if the, acquaintance proved mutually agreeable, they would like to bind him by domestic ties to the Old Dominion. What steps were taken to promote the fortunes of the nephew under this hearty invitation, will not form aeypart of this volume.

And this simple yet sufficient epitaph ends the history of "The Successful Man."

THE ALPHABET HARD TO LEARN BY AN AMBITIOUS BOY, WlHO TUMBLES- INTO THE SPRING, AND IS RESCUED TO TAKE HS PEN IN HAND. IN one of the Revolutionary States south of the Potol mac there lived a farmer in the middle, rank of society; neither poor nor rich. His name was Jeffrey Clayton, and the maiden name of his wife was Patience Shirley. Their first child, Paul, was born while Mr. Jefferson was Presi- dent. Passing by, as of little consequence at this stage of our history, the personal manifestations of the child, it will suffice to say that in his fifth year he was sent to school, to try his skill on the alphabet in Webster's Spelling-Book. His tutor was the Rev. Bothic Campbell, a Scotch gentle- man of excellent character, who had married the widow of a Revolutionary officer and resided in the vicinity. Little Paul had his perplexities: he thought it was a hard task to memorize four letters of the alphabet a day, and his hitherto happy nature received its first shock by a stern command from the teacher to mind his book, when he was inclined to gaze at other objects in preference, especially at the larger boys and girls as they said their lessons aloud, beginning with a bow or a curtchie, and ending with V                   321  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7248-00000162"/> o's       MND AND MATTER: the same act of reverence, when they stood before the chief. His first day at school was the inception of a strange career. Had the little boy, as he described to his parents at night the wonders of the school-room--the benches and desks, the silent attention, thespelling and reading classes -those who ciphered and those who wrote in copy-books, and the joyous interval at playtime when they all rushed to their little oaken baskets or tin buckets for the good things which their mothers had fixed up to satisfy the ap- petite--had innocent little Paul, as with his eager blue eyes and ready tongue he uttered the impressions of the day to his smiling parents at night, been conscious of the future,-had its realities, with his portion of sorrow, passed as a picture before his mind or been imaged in his dreams -his strength of body would have yielded at once to the terrible burden, and the next morning, instead of being dressed for school, he would have been shrouded for the grave. Poor boy, frail germ of humanity, destined to great intellectual culture and high moral aspirations in thy future walk, this record is to tell of sufferings, to prevent hich it would have been a blessing to thee had death visited thy childhood! But the opening chapter of his life ought to contain this passage. One of 'the neighboring families sent a grown youth to the same school. West Birchall passed the door of Paul's home every morning, and called for him. When the road was muddy, or the branch swollen after a rain West carried Paul on his back,-a  service for which the child and his parents were truly grateful. There was a spring near, from which the school was supplied with water. An empty flour-barrel, with both heads knocked out, had been placed over the fountain, with sand in the bottom to relieve the water from impurities of the soil. One day Master Paul strolled to the spring alone, and com- menced tossing pebbles into it, to see how beautifully the   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     -323 sunlight danced on the ripples, and discovered the white sand below. The water lacked some eight or ten inches of being level with the top of the barrel. To have a better view, Paul laid himself flat on the edge of the barrel, look- ing with curiosity at the bubbling sand, and wondered how the spring could boil without fire. From appearances he thought he could reach the bottom with his hand, and test the temperature of the boiling water before it got cold on top! In making the philosophical experiment, he lost his equilibrium, and in he tumbled, head foremost. Just at this crisis, his guardian angel, West Birchall, happened to come to the spring, and rescued him from his perilous situation. Paul was drawn out half dead, and it required much shaking by the heels, with his head downward, and thump- ing of his sides, to revive the breathless youngster. West kept the secret from the school, dried Paul in the sun, and advised him not to dive any more after pebbles in such a narrow pool of water that he could not turn himself to' the surface. Poor West loved Paul as a brother; and the affection was fully reciprocated. There was soon a draft of militia for the War of 1812, and West was stationed at Blast Island, on the coast, where hundreds of the'soldiers perished from disease, and  those who survived were so broken in constitution that. nearly all of them became in- valids for life. West removed to another State during the war, and volunteered against the Indians on the frontier. His name is honorably mentioned in the rolls of the service. This allusion to him is deemed proper, as, but for his timely aid at the spring,-Paul would then and there have ceased to exist, and no hero for this, story would have. been provided. The next school to which Paul was sent was conducted by a gentleman whose ancestors were distinguished for the civil and military commissions they held before and after the American Revolution.  This gentleman took just pride in the circumstance, and bore himself with an eleva. pr  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7248-00000163"/> 324       MND AND MATTER: ' tion in manners and dress worthy: of! pedigree. Paul was then in his seventh year, aridi was often at the head of hit class. Mr.-Alphonsb\Wetmore, the teacher, gave entie satisfaction to all his patrons, and his discontinuance of the school at the end of the year was generally re- gretted. But it is unnecessary to follow Paul through his educa- tional course, which was quite limited. There would be long intervals between' one teacher and another in the vicinity. Sometimes a year or more would elapse without any school, during which time Paul's little stock of erudi- tion contrived to vanish, so that he had to be put back to "baker," and "No man may put off the Law of God," several times, before he could stand firm at "ambiguity." His father intended him for his own calling, that of a tiller of the soil. Only two crop-seasons passed in which Paul did not labor in the fields, from the age when he was com- petent to drop field-peas in a charger, until he graduated at the plough-handles in his seventeenth year. In the mean time he had collected a few books, mostly historical and religious, which had been prescribed by his mother, who was fond of reading. Thus far he had jever seen a novel or work of fiction - b t in his daily toil on the farm, dreams of a higher life Rited him. The idea of authorship, or the ability tot! e whole books, implied all that was glorious and perp inhuman nature. Paul had tried to write a few lets, and found himself deficient in language and in the art of- putting words together smoothly. It was a long time before he discovered any form of commencing an epistle other than the one he had seen in every manuscript letter which had fallen under his observation among the neighbors, and from his family re- lation :-"I sit down, and take my pen in hand to inform you that I am in good health, and hope these few lines will find you enjoying the same blessing." This was ad- mirable, and no improvement could be made upon it, in   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     325 Paul's estimation. What words could be more suitable to express the action? First, sit down, to show ease of posture for the wooing of bright ideas, and then take up the pen, to write them down as they oozed from the brain, or as emo- tions gushed from the heart. Was any thing more natural, and could the phraseology be' changed for the better? Young Paul was of opinion that it could not, until he launched upon a new ocean, where he experienced all sorts of weather. In his voyage of life there is something worthy of note by the way. CHAPTER II. WHEREIN FLOWERS AND WEEDS GROW TOGETHER IN YOUTH, AND A DARK NIGHT IS SUCCEEDED BY A BRIGHT MORN- ING. MANY Of the neighbors who observed the disposition of Paul remarked to his father that some other pursuit ought to be chosen for him. His frame was delicate, and he took every possible occasion to evade hard labor in the field, by fixing up bars and gates about the farm, and repairing the yard and garden enclosures for his mother, planting out trees, flowers, and all wild shrubs which bore hand- some bloom or foliage. In this way he encouraged the young people who visited the family to experiment at home; and the result was a decided improvement in yard-ornaments and in social feeling in the neighborhood. Some of the old people shook their heads gravely, and called it nonsense; but the growing generation saw in it a new source of happiness, and actually commenced to speak of the beauties of nature, which, though all the time before them, they had never perceived until the success of Paul in'beautifying the old homestead opened their eyes. A new 28  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7248-00000164"/> 326      . MND AND MATTER.: era seemed about to dawn. More newspapers were taken, more books read, and the gatherings of the young people on festive occasions were marked by more affability and intelligence. The day of rigid manners had passed. Paul bad set an example which had a beneficial influence upon their tastes. He was still regarded, however, by the stern old utilitarians-the hard-shells of country life-as a rest- less sort of creature, whose head books had turned wrong and whose heart flowers 'had spoiled. They declared that such things had never been in their youthful days, and that Mr. Clayton was to blame for allowing Paul not only to trifle away his own time, but to lead other young peo- ple into ruin, by books and flower-gardens! While under the frowns of the older and controlling portion of the community in which his lot was cast, and sensible of a void within which the society about him could not fill, Paul determined upon a change of residence and pursuit. To this end, he committed the great error Of leaving hope under a false pretext, when his real object was to negotiate for employment in a city to which he had frequently traded with the produce of his father's farm, ever since he was large enough to accompany a team to market and to make sales and purchases. He succeeded in procuring a situation as clerk in a store,' at a small salary, with the prospect of having it increased as his services might justify. Paul knew that he had deceived his father, and regretted the step he had taken, it being the first time he had ever set parental authority at defiance. But he palliated the offence by saying within himself, "My father does not understand me. - I can never be made a good farmer. -My thoughts run in a different direction. Though he has heretofore opposed my wishes in this respect, he will probably consent to my leaving, after I inform- h'im of :my engagement-with Mr. Bolton:" In this train of reflection, trembling between hope and fear, Paul returneed home, where he found a dark cloud   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     827 ready to burst upon his head. It descended in all its wrath. His mother's entreaty in his behalf was of no avail. The paternal malediction had been uttered: ser- vitude to the last hour of the law was to be Paul's heritage, and nothing more. An earlier discharge had been intended, if he had not transgressed; but now he should wear the yoke until it galled him into obedience! Such was the decree; and most unhappy was Paul when he felt the cer- tainty of its execution. A point had arrived in the history of this young man which was to decide his fate. He saw that the only alter- native was to escape from what he conceived to be injustice and oppression inflicted by a father's hand, and by such escape to aggravate a father's displeasure and perhaps subject himself to legal process to vindicate parental authority, or by gentle submission to endure with for- titude whatever trials might attend the remaining four yars of his minority. He revolved the issue carefully in his mind, often looked into the face of his mother to see if he still retained her affection to make his lot less intolerable, and then called to mind the many instances of his father's kindness,--his sending him to school more than any other of his children, and the little tokens of favor he had otherwisebestowed on him,-all proving that his father was no tyrant, though his inability to comprehend the faculties of his son and the necessity of a change of em- ployment'to turn those faculties to profit was still an adjudged question with Paul. With a calm purpose to serve his father more patiently than ever, and by a uni- form course of duty and toil to atone -for his past rebellion, Paul took his place on the farm with alacrity, under the influence of his new character. It was in the spring of the year 18- when the inci- dent occurred which brought his father's authority upon him in a form that nearly drove him to despair. All the visions which his fancy had conjured up of intelligent and  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7248-00000165"/> sub 2      MND AND MATTER: fashionable society, of refined manners and public applause, of preferment in -life, and a name to be respected for the brilliant qualities of its possessor,--those sweet hopes were, to all human appearance, blasted forever! In his view the farm was a gloomy prison-yard, surrounded by high walls, and the neighbors so many heartless spectators, who, having no desires beyond their daily food, nightly repose, and exemption from labor as the fortune of each per- mitted, were utterly incapable of sympathizing with an original, upward nature. Because Paul had been raised among them, went to school with their children, hunted birds and fished as they did, and shared in all the sports of boyhood, it was manifest that his longing for books was merely to avoid labor in the field and the summer's heat, to which his betters had submitted without a word of complaint. Such was the discourse of the good old neighbors as they sat in judgment on the aspirations of Paul. One gentleman, who had several pretty daughters just grown, and others growing up, advised Mr. Clayton to give Paul his liberty, as it was useless to keep him on the farm for the small amount of work which could be forced out of him contrary to his inclinations for a higher pursuit. Ah! whether that advice was prompted by the angels of the household, whom Paul worshipped, and with whom he went to school before they attained the angelic stature, may never be known in this world! It is at least a coincidence which adds to the crown of woman as an alleviation of sorrow. A month passed on. Paul had never been so industrious and obedient. He rose earlier, and took a better view of agriculture than before. He found it necessary to brace himself up by such violence to his nature in order to keep himself from sinking at once under the burden which had been laid upon him. Still, the fires of his soul raged while he followed the plough.  Court-houses, lawyers, graceful and fine-talking men, and cheerful, well-dressed   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     329 women, such as he had seen in the city and travelling on the public highway, flitted before his imagination. Could he ever mingle with such company? Was it possible for him, a rough farmer-boy, to get within the enchanted circle? There was happiness in perfection. The race was entirely superior to country mortals, and Paul sighed as his medi- tations afforded him no relief. The dismal gulf yawned, and there was no bridge to span it. Roused from his re- very, he made his labor more brisk, as if in this way he could quiet the tortures of a wounded spirit. The effort was partially successful. One month of the forty-eight which stood between him and freedom had gone by; and he had learned to regulatie his troubles, to invite none in advance, as "sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.' 'A reverend professor of the University of Orange Hill (in honor of whose memdry the highest mountain in North America has since received his name) was to preach at the county site, and Mr. Clayton had never heard a man from any seat of learning. He therefore indulged his curiosity, leaving Paul at work in the field, under a scorching sun. Night came, and with it a sweet message to Paul. In the course of his sermon, the reverend professor referred to the duty of parents toward their children, and quoted the words of Scripture, "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, lest they be discouraged." The soul of Mr. Clayton was touched. He reflected on his treatment of Paul; and on his return home-he addressed his, son in a mild, loving voice, while moisture dimmed his eyes:--"You may get ready as soon as you please, and fulfil your engagement with Mr, Bolton. The preacher told us to-day not to be too hard upon the faults of our children." He said no more. The heavy load was removed. Paul wept, his mother wept,. and the younger children'joined in the weep- ing; for they understood that Paul was about to leave home, never, perhaps, to come back, and it was the first chasm ever made in the family by voluntary absence. In  28'  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7248-00000166"/> 330       MND AND MATTER: about a week, the farewell arrived. His uncle, Manly Clayton, was going to the city, and it was agreed that Paul should take a seat in his vehicle. The small bundle of clothes had been neatly packed by his fond mother; and after exchanging words of affection and tender embraces, while tears flowed from all eyes, the poor boy left the paternal roof, to plod his way as best he could through the - mazes of life.  His heart almost failed him when the hour of separation came. The home of his childhood had never before appeared so attractive; even the trees and the flowers which he had planted in the yard for his mother seemed to join in mute supplication for him to stay. The servants who had nursed his infancy (for there were two such, brother and sister) took leave of him with sobs of grief. It was a serious event, the loss of their young master, who in childhood had often reposed in their arms. And thou university divine, long since called to thy rest above, what influence thy words exerted, and what direction was thus given to ) the fortunes of a rustic"'youth, his happiness or misery, may one day be known when preacher, father, and child shall stand face to face before the judgment-seat of the Eternal!

PAUL CLAYTON arrives in the city, and reports himself to Mr. Bolton. e is at once installed behind the counter, and shown the counting-room books, the blotter, the day-book, journal, and ledger, with the different entries to represent   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     331 goods bought in as stock, and goods sold on credit and also for cash,--the latter to be balanced every night. The yard- stick was placed in his hand, to measure several large rolls of merchandise, the precise quantity of which his employer wished to ascertain. Paul went through the exercise awk- wardly, it is true, but sufficiently well to please Mr. Bolton. A number of small packages in different parts of the store were subjected -to Paul's revision, who opened, adjusted, and put them in new wrappers, to give his fingers the proper facility in such operations. After a week in the store, assisting the chief clerk, Paul was introduced to the warehouse and shipping branch of the concern. He took charge of the wharf, kept account of cargoes and of storage, and made reports at night. He had a seat at the family table of his employer, who was a wealthy man, rather stern to his inferiors, and not very talkative in the do- mestic circle. By his own diligence and merit, Mr. Bolton had risen from the post of a cooper's boy to a clerkship, then to a partnership with one of the oldest and strongest firms, and ultimately succeeded to the business alone, which he rolled up, by the safest laws of trade, to be the very largest in the city. He had several vessels running to the North, and others to the West Indies, from which latter he imported large cargoes of sugar, molasses, rum, and brandy, besides other produce of the islands. The invoices of these had to be registered by Paul, who found himself utterly broken down by the labors of the warehouse, and the deli- very of articles to customers, gauging wine and liquor casks, and making out bills specifying the contents of each package. At night he was often deprived of sleep by his anxiety, for he knew that his employer would find fault unless every thing was managed with the utmost precision. The chief clerk, Harvey Johns, who was a grown man and a relative of Mr. Bolton, and one of the best accountants in the city, had to endure many indignities which none  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7248-00000167"/> 332       MND AND MATTER: but a captious and tyrannical nature would pretend to offer. To beguile lhigshours at night, Paul had recourse to a circulating library attached to the book-store of Mr. Solo- mon. Ball, from which, on payment of a small sum, any book could be had for the space of a week. His choice was "Bracebridge Hall," then newly from the press. It was the first romance he ever read, and it acted upon him like a charm. What curious situations the characters were constantly placed in I Just as one difficulty was overcome, another would take its place. Men became suddenly rich and as suddenly poor. When hard pressed, and ruin was staring him in the face, the hero would be informed by a courier, who had ridden day and night for the purpose, that an uncle or an aunt had just died, leaving him sole heir to -large possessions. Of course the whole face of things was changed in a moment by this fortunate dying of relations. And then, if a rich lover paid his addresses to an elegant young lady, more beautiful than painting or sculpture ever represented, and the wedding-day was fixed, lo and behold, the banker of the bridegroom, who held all his fortune on deposite, even a million of dollars, had suddenly failed, and could pay only ten cents in the dollar, at which rate he had compounded with his creditors. The banker had been, for thirty years at the -head of the financial list; but a junior partner had incautiously taken ten millions of stock in some coal-mine, which-had proved to be valueless, and hence the catastrophe. A special messenger brings this painful intelligence from the solicitor of the bridegroom, as the latter is half dressed for his wedding. He rushes wildly into the presence of the bride's father, sinks upon a sofa, and cries out that all is lost,-he is a beggar! The lovely Annette, also about half dressed, with a huge string of pearls on her alabaster neck, and her bridal robe flowing in graceful curves on the rich carpet, approaches dear Frederick, and demands the cause of his affliction. "My   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     333 banker! oh, my banker!" is the reply. "All is gone! Not a dollar in the world!"Annette gently says, "Is that all, Frederick? I was afraid some ugly spider had bitten you." They marry, and next morning, before the bridegroom shows himself, another courier arrives with a second de- spatch from the solicitor, stating that the bridegroom's uncle on the maternal side, Captain Langley Langford, of His Majesty's East India Company, had perished at sea. Among his papers was found a will, bequeathing all his estates in Devonshire, and in the London stocks,-not less than five millions,-to his favorite nephew Frederick Friz- zlewig, Esquire, the happy bridegroom. Then follows the dialogue between the loving pair and their friends. Paul had never heard conversation half so finished. Every sentence was classical, and tapered off with soft emotion and the most exquisite compliments, such as the people in his part of the country, even the best in the city,-the bookseller himself, the lawyers, preachers and schoolmasters,-could never equal. Artless Paul de- voured the narrative with a relish which he never before , experienced for any object. It opened to him a new world. These romantic histories were his mental food for months at a time, always exciting in him the liveliest sensations of joy or sorrow, as the scenes and characters happened to vibrate. Irving, Scott, Cooper, and other writers of fiction have a large account to settle for turning the minds of the young into a false channel, and investing life with colors which inspire a momentary pleasure, through the imagina- tion, never to be realized in society. Or it may be that such authors are entitled to thanks for throwing silken cables over dark caverns, covered by a gaudy net-work of golden fringe, and all surmounted by a velvet canopy under which travellers may repose in ecstasy for one hour, to be disappointed the balance of their lives. Thus did Paul -Clayton speculate within himself at a later period, to which this story will conduct him.  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7248-00000168"/> 334       MND AND MATTER: CHAPTER IV. HOW LIFE BECOMES EMNENTLY DRAMATIC, IN WHCH THERE IS TRAGEDY, FEMALE PREACHNG, DOORS OPENED BY BEEL- ZEBUB, AND A VARIETY OF STRANGE MATTERS. BEING dissatisfied with- the hard drudgery which he had to perform for Mr. Sitgreaves Bolton, and with the aristo- cratic and snarling propensities of that gentleman, Paul sought a more agreeable situation, and was accepted by Mr. Julius Schofield, a dealer in family supplies, whose feeble health required an active assistant. Mr. Schofield was suffering from the effects of bad usage in Dartmoor Prison, England, where he had been confined with a number of other Americans who had been captured at sea * in the late war, and had narrowly escaped the massacre in 1815, when he beheld sixty-four of his comrades butchered in cold blood by the guard, but which crime was disowned by the British Government. Mr. Schofield was a very pre. cise man, tidy in his dress and in all his household ar- rangements, which Paul believed to result more from the taste of Mr. Schofield's handsome young wife than from his own ideas in this regard, he having been a reckless bachelor, with just property enough to secure a kind nurse in the person of an unprovided orphan-girl, who devoted herself assiduously and faithfully to render him comfort- able. They had alternate spells of sunshine and of cloud, as his invalid moods chanced to operate on a disposition naturally inclined to make all happy around him. Paul devoted himself closely to the interests of his employer. He had considerable time  for reading in the pauses of business, and especially at night. The circulating library   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     335 was still his chief resort, though he had purchased a few books of his own, of a more solid kind, which he read too hastily, under the belief that the kernel was just ahead, as page after page was turned over with novel rapidity. Several events occurred about this time which deserve i notice, as contributing step by step to Paul's knowledge of the world. The first was the acting drama, which he had never seen. A company of very respectable performers engaged the theatre, and posted up their bills. "She Stoops to Conquer," a comedy by Goldsmith, was the entertainment, with an amusing after-piece. The stage, scenes, and music, and, above all, the characters, so dressed to life, as the plot required, and acting so naturally, getting offended, laughing, and the females blushing and holding down their heads in confusion when they were courted, and especially the t"Widow Cheerly," who was the nicest figure in the play, all so delighted him that Paul at once voted the theatre a great institution. He attended the re- presentation of several tragedies, the first of which was "Virginius," who kills his daughter to save her from a dis- honorable fate. The principal character was sustained by a gentleman of letters, whose name is among the "Poets ,of America," and whose elocution was brilliant and com- manding. Paul afterward took private lessons from him. There was a Spanish ship run into port, from stress of weather, for repairs. The crew came on shore, and scat- tered terror in all directions. In one of his evening ram- bles, Paul heard the cry of murder, and hurried away from what he supposed might be danger to persons in the street. The next day he acquainted the city marshal with the cir- cumstance, who replied that it was only one of the Spaniards trying to alarm some timorous person. On the succeeding night, a man from the country was killed in a sailor board- ing-house% by one of the ship's crew. The offender was com- mitted toprison, where Paul saw hitm, walking and mutter- ing in his dungeon. The eminent advocate andjurist, Mr.  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7248-00000169"/> O36       MND AND MATTER: Grayson, received one thousand dollars in Spanish doub- loons for the defence, which was successful on the technical definition of domicile. A very remarkable, and at the same time a very corrupt, man, whose name was Redsilver, had been playing off his tricks on the banks and large merchants of the city. He was a locksmith by trade, but of universal skill in'ma- chinery and the fine arts. It was said that he could make- any thing he pleased. - He had frequently been convicted of receiving stolen goods and trading with slaves. The fi'st thing he usually did after each discharge from prison, was to open the front door of one of the banks, and, when the cashier came down next- morning, Redsilver, standing at the door, would inquire how. he rested, and tell him not to be alarmed, for all was safe. Such proved to be the fact: nothing had been disturbed but the lock, and even it was not injured. He would aehiP the same way with toe merchants,- especially those who had prosecuted him,-open their doors, stand guard, and bid them good-morning, without touching, or suffering others to touch, an article in the store. Paul frequently saw this man, who had a very large head, and black, piercing eyes. Intellect and depravity on a broad scale were united in that miserable Englishman, the locksmith, who was also an excellent portrait and landscape painter. It may not seem respectful to notice, in a paragraph next to the preceding, another circumstance which excited the attention of Paul; but, disclaiming all- levity, the fact was curious in itself, and was among his earliest impressions of the city. It was announced that a Quakeress wpuld preach in one of the churches at a particular hour. The audience was large. In the pulpit sat a broadbrim gentleman, and by his side a lady dressed in a dove-colored silk gown, and a cap without a border or-any trimmings whatever. Over her neck and shoulders a plain white kerchief was drawn, crossed in front and pinned. Not the shadow of an ornament in dress was to   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     337 be seen. Her simplicity was almost solemn; but it was relieved in a measure by a placid countenance, expressive of meekness and the triumph of the spiritual in our nature. The lady arose in the pulpit, and, without any hymn or prayer as introductory, began at once to "teach," as the Friends call it. Her voice was feeble, but pleasant, and its clear tones could be heard distinctly in all parts of the house. In a short time it ran into a chant, or sing-song !    lmelody, almost distressing to the listener by its devotional fervor. Her language and thoughts were good, and the discourse was replete with orthodox instruction. It was the first time Paul ever heard a woman speak in public; and he has ever since estimated more highly the in- tellectual capacity of the sex from that specimen. The Hon.-Junius Stanfield, the very prince of orators, was present in the congregation, and on coming out of the door was heard to praise the preacheress. Thus far, Paul had never trespassed on the dominions of Neptune, the salt sea, or any armlet thereof. He was persuaded by several young men to join a sailing-party in the bay. The canvas was hoisted, and away the skiff glided before the wind, all hands merry enough, except Paul, who imagined the billows to be particularly savage in their treatment of the boat, sometimes pitching her head under water, and then careening her almost on beam-ends. The other passengers declared it was very fine sport. On their return, the breeze became quite stiff, dashing large quantities of water into the boat, which rendered the baling process necessary. Some of the " veterans" on board began to look whiter than usual, as tack after tack with head-winds brought them no nearer the wharf. At this crisis, Paul thought of his land-occupations, and would have gladly consented to serve out his minority with his father, if thereby his life would have been guaran- teed in the present emergency. The danger was imminent; and it was owing altogether to providential favor that the W          29  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7248-00000170"/> 338       MND AND MATTER: party once more reached land. When all was safe, Paul heard the others confess that they had expected a watery grave, though they had deemed it prudent to conceal their apprehensions. Such was his first adventure in a sailing- craft, and he was shy of the amusement in future, although from necessity he afterward took several long voyages; but the sea always owed him a grudge, and never failed to demand a casting up of accounts the first hour after clearing the light-house, lest too long a credit might run within the statute of limitations which gives impunity to most of the sons of Neptune. But the situation of Paul was soon to undergo a change. The health of his employer, Mr. Schofield, failed more rapidly than ever, and the consumption brought on by his imprisonment at Dartmoor was soon to terminate his life. He saw his' fate written, and conversed freely with Paul on the state of his business. The bank-book was produced, which showedl the daily or weekly deposites made by Paul, as the cash sales and collections might warrant, with all which Mr. Schofield was satisfied. He warmly commended the diligence and fidelity of Paul, and confessed himself fortunate in obtaining the services of one so reliable to represent him in the store; for all the merchants. in the vicinity had given Paul a good character as a salesman and manager. Not wishing to incur too much responsi- bility, and having posted up all the books, and drawing his balance-sheet, which he submitted, Paul tendered the keys of the store to his employer. He was requested to continue till the last moment, -which he declined. The services of Paul were then valued, and a check was given for more than the amount, and their business relations ceased in the most friendly manner. Within two days, Mr. Schofield died, and his executor prevailed on Paul to assist in making out the inventory, as he was' better acquainted than any one else -with the parcels in store. After this, he was again without employment.   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     339 CHAPTER V. FORTUNE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY THE TAILORS, AND HEREIN AN EXAMPLE OF TREMENDOUS DIGNITY-A YOUTH RAISED ABOVE HS OWN HEAD, AND SOBERED DOWN BY A WISE SON OF NEPTUNE. Two years had elapsed since Paul first left the old home- stead, whose loved inmates, however, he had occasionally visited during the time. On some of these visits he went to church in the neighborhood, and met many of his school- mates. His appearance was no longer rustic like theirs. He had been completely transformed by the tailor into a superior being, as he felt himself by comparison. The school-girls with whom he used to romp at Christmas, and who never seemed to know Paul except by his Christian name, fixed up their pretty mouths to call him "Mr. Claythn," as a recognition of his boots and broadcloth and of his city elegance of manner. But the surname could not be uttered without a mischievous twinkling of the eye, which plainly showed that the fair ones did not believe in so dignified a title for their late school-companion, and they again styled him "Paul,"- a sound in which he always delighted when proceeding from gentle lips. :His visits were long enough to dine or spend an evening with his nearest neighbors, who had known him from his cradle. On one occasion he was much em- barrassed by a good old lady who had often filled his pockets with cake and sweet things when he came to play with her children almost every Saturday afternoon until about his twelfth year, when, claiming to rank with the larger boys, he abandoned childish sports, and took him-  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7248-00000171"/> self to manly esorcises,-the shooting of birds, chasing of rabbits, and the destruction of all the game which his dog and gun brought within proper range. The good dame referred to sat in the chimney-corner, pipe in hand, smoking earnestly, asking Paul about city fashions, and the price of leaf tobacco, (a superior lot of which she acknowledged as a present from Paul when he was clerk,) and suddenly proposed the question to Paul, in presence of her daughters, which he thought was the oldest, himself or Elmira. He replied instantly that of course he was two years her senior, as his mother's Bible registered him at eighteen, and Elmira could not possibly be more than  sixteen. Paul knew better, for he had heard his mother relate the circumstance which was now  about to be di- vulged by the plain-spoken, kind Mrs. Iarmanson,--that the first baby-dress Paul ever had on consisted of a beau- tiful suit which had served the same office for Elmira one year before his birth: therefore her daughter was fully nineteen years old, and was of a good age to learn house- keeping. This information confused Elmira, and mortified Paul exceedingly, as he was unwilling for it to be sup- posed that his gay figure, attired in the height of fashion and looking so dignified, had ever been smothered in baby- clothes! The idea was inadmissible; and he relieved the- embarrassment of Elmira and his own by taking his de- parture.  Whten Paul returned to the city, he had not decided what steps he should take. He had saved a little money, which would keep him afloat a while, and he could there- fore wait for the tide of affairs -to see if he could take it O"in the food." At this juncture he made the acquaintance of Captain Alexander Jennings, who, after an absence of twenty years, had come back to gaze once more on the scenes of his youth. Captain Jennings had commanded vessels from the port in the Philadelphia and West-India trade for about,twenty-five years, and was intimately (     . . .i   acquainted with the old mercantile houses which were established mainly by his voyages, and knew the beginning of the present commercial chiefs: The captain belonged to the old regime who wore ruffles in the bosom and on the wrists, and fair top boots. He was between sixty and seventy years of age, had a very fresh complexion, and quite a jovial, buoyant manner, which contrasted finely with his gray hair. His voice was charming: it had the clearest tones imaginable, and it could express authority and gentleness with equal grace. Paul had never before seen a character so entirely original, so noble and cap- tivating; and he congratulated himself on the favor with which the captain evidently regarded him. They were daily together at the same boarding-house, where the conversation was led by the captain, but mostly directed to Paul, who did the best he could to acquit himself credit, ably in the replies he was expected to make. It was a new chapter in Paul's life. There; sat before him a man advanced in years, of most dignified presence, and excelling all others with whom he had ever conversed, in aptness of -thought, variety of knowledge, and strength of style,- and that venerable man bestowing on Paul the highest marks of esteem! Surely it was an occasion which he -ought to improve. Captain Jennings invited Paul to accompany him about the city. They visited the different wharves and business- localities, the captain pointing out where most of the shipping lay, and the site of the warehouses, in his day. Some of the places had been altered, old wharves aban- doned, and new ones erected. Paul gave him the present names, and showed him Mr. Bolton's store, at the corner of Jones and Harget Streets. It was the very spot, even the same old red building, which had been occupied by Treadwell &amp; Thurmond thirty years before, when Bolton was a destitute boy on the town, and was glad to run errands or do any little service for a trifling compensa- 294  &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7248-00000172"/> MUtn AND MATTER: tion. His irst known employment was to carry the tray of gingerbread for old Susan Tinmore from corner to corner in the streets, as the exigencies of trade or the state of the weather might render necessary. Captain Jennings knew Bolton well in those times, and gave Paul a minute history of him, without malice and without varnish. The words of the captain will be introduced, as descriptive of a cha- racter which may be looked upon as strictly representative of the commercial class. Addressing himself to Paul, Captain Jennings remarked, "You told me that you lived with Mr. Bolton a short time. I am not surprised at your leaving him. He is a man of integrity in a commercial sense; but he has no heart. You have been informed of his humble condition in the outset. I have many things to say before I exhaust the topic. You will bear them in mind, I hope, as there is a moral conveyed. "You must remember," continued Captain Jennings, "that there is a contest between MND and MATTER no less fierce than that between good and evil in the world. Take -this lesson home with you, and ponder it well. I have seen the world and all sorts of men from a variety of stand- points, and I claim to be a judge of human nature. Lest I weary you, however, I proceed with Mr. Bolton from his impoverished boyhood to his present condition of wealth and influence. "You have seen the story of Lafitte, the eminent French banker, how that his fortune was made by a pin,-yes, a solitary pin! He was a plain country youth, no better than yourself,-just -as poor," and, allow me to say, not more intel- ligent. Coming to Paris for such employment as chance might throw in his way, he presented himself at a banker's counter and asked for a  clerkship. It was a bold step, truly; but nothing is lost by boldness, while much is usually gained by it. The banker looked at him steadily, and then dismissed him, saying that there was no situation vacant I         i I    A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.      643 which he could offer him. The man of gold kept his eye on the youth as he retired through the court, and saw him stoop down and pick up a pin. He called him back, asked some questions about his family, personal habits, and ideas of business, and then gave him a clerkship. The trust was faithfully discharged: every thing was done at the right time and in the right manner; every thing had a place, and every thing was in its place. Punctuality to a minute, and complete order in all his work, soon gained for the young clerk the confidence of his employer. When the latter retired from business, Lafitte succeeded him as chief banker; and with him Napoleon kept his account of millions and hundreds of millions while Emperor of France. So much for a pin; and great commercial minds best know i the significancy of a pin. "I venture to say that even now, with all his riches, Mr. Bolton makes it a practice to pick up a pin on prin- ciple, and he sticks it in his coat, as you have no doubt seen, or may see if you will take the trouble to examine. He saves the pin, though he never malkes use of it. In this he proves, in general truth, that attention to small things is necessary to accumulation. But there is one idea in this matter fiot less significant. Just as every nail driven into the building increases its strength, so every pin that a man picks up gives strength to his economical habits, while the point of every pin lets out a drop of sympathy from his soul. Therefore, the better fortified by a stockade of pins-by which figure I intend to express degrees of selfishness--the less concern a man feels in the welfare of others. So le is safe, he cares not who the Indians may scalp outside of his territory. When he hears the cry of distress, he consoles himself by saying, I Had others picked up pins and built a fort as I have done, they would have been equally well protected from danger.' "Such is the callous heart of wealth! Not that the pos- session of riches is inimical to the finer sensibilities: far  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7248-00000173"/> olt       MND AND MATTER: from it. The possession is often the means of cultivating those soft graces of character which can grow in no other soil. There is a fitness of things clearly stamped by nature on all her works. It- is glorious to see a kind- o hearted young man assisting his fellow-creatures by the wealth he has inherited: his soul fattens as he gives, and he luxuriates in charity. He is an angel,-one of the few rich angels on earth. His heart has not been indurated by the pin-prooessy-by punctures letting out the soul. To that operation his father submitted while providing the wealth which the son dispenses with such honor to humanity. "Mr. Bolton is a model merchant. He never had his paper protested in his life. His name stands in Market Street on a par with that of Mr. Girard's Bank on Third Street; in Philadelphia. His order to Cope &amp; Co. for goods, or to Mr. Girard, who is also an importer, will be filled to any amount. I have had my vessels loaded from both those houses when in the trade for Treadwell &amp; Thurmond, the benefactors of Mr. Bolton. While sailing from the port, I have frequently seen the present proud and impe- rious Mr. Bolton lifting sacks and packages from the hold of my vessel, as a common hand, glad to make his four shillings a day. He saved his money: a copper then was a greater object with him than a gold eagle now; and yet he is the same penurious, punctual, honest, and heartless man.   He sets himself up as the standard for others to measure themselves by; and if you were found reading 'Chesterfield's Letters,' or any other book on politeness, he would consider you unfit to pack pork, to roll turpentine- barrels, or count hogshead-staves, as he used to do-and behold what he has since accomplished! This would be his lecture, as he sneeringly informed you that your ser- vices were no longer desired. "Now," continued Captain Jennings to Paul, "I have let you into the secret of commercial character. It is a compound of honor and selfishness,-honor to fulfil engage-   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     845 ments promptly, and the most selfish principle in hoarding up to gratify a weak ambition to be called rich, without any of the qualities to command respect aside from wealth. Many pursue trade for excitement, as for a long time I fol- lowed the sea from the same motive, without any definite calculation as to the result. Look at Mr. Girard: he is the richest man in America,--said to be worth ten millions of dollars. He has no family to inherit his treasures; and yet he goes on Snore eagerly than ever to hoard up. It is impossible for Mr. Girard, and others who surrender their souls to accumulation, to feel for the misfortunes and dis- tresses of their fellow-men. Such capitalists are misers on principle: they seek gold for the pure love of having it,-as if the possession conferred on them any exalted quality which the world should applaud. It is sometimes the case that a rich man, heirless, will found public charities on his death-bed. This is no argument to prove that he had a heart capable of feeling for others. Sympathy genuine and true can never exist in that bosom which closes the portals of mercy to the starving poor who are daily seen. It is pride, a vain, arrogant pride, that passes by such objects; and it is not the less pride and vanity that prompts a magnificent charity, to be executed when the founder and his wealth are parted forever. "My young friend, you have listened to me patiently. I thank you for so doing. My object is to be of service to you at a period when the voice of experience is more to be trusted than the speculations of that generous nature which I recognised in you from the moment I formed your acquaintance. You aim to be happy. From my soul I wish you all the bliss which your heart can desire or your ima- gination can paint. I am no example to imitate. I have been a wanderer, and have visited every quarter of the globe. Some of my adventures brought me large sums of money, which I have invested. I have no wife or children to enjoy my earnings, and it may be that I was wrong in  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7248-00000174"/> not having a family. I often pass severe judgment on my- self. But one thing I have ever retained,--a heart to love mankind. Let your troubles in fature be what they may, as my parting advice I beseech you to look on the bright side of things do'your best to make others happy, and leave the issue to Heaven, where I trust we shall meet again." Captain Jennings then approached Paul, shook him affectionately by the hand, and, in a voice subdued by emo- tion, pronounced the last farewell! Paul retired to his chamber, to indulge reflections which it is easier to imagine than describe. The noble-hearted old captain took ship- ping for his home in the West Indies, and in a few years his death was announced. CHAPTER   VI. WHEREIN PAUL CLAYTON ENCOUNTERS VERY POLISHED PEO-  PLE, AND HOE10W HE PROCEEDS TO MAKE HMSELF A NAME,  FULLY CONVINCED THAT THE MATERIAL Is IN HM. MUSING on his condition, and the great purposes of life, with his inadequate means to attain distinction or happi- ness in any pursuit, Paul subjected himself to a severe examination. Here I am, thought he, a dead branch. I am conscious of powers which need only proper direction to make them available. In two years I have cast off the country clown, and, without assistance from any quarter, or even the suggestions of an intelligent friend, I have gained an amount of knowledge and so improved my ad- dress that I can appear in the parlors of the great, where on a  few occasions I have been invited. Wby should I not be a  man? What shall prevent success if I make the resoi lution to conquer? If the books that I have read contain   a particle of truth, hundreds of young men have risen to eminence under greater difficulties. I will study naviga- tion, and command vessels like my friend Captain Jennings. Would it not be a pleasant surprise that in less than three years "Captain Clayton" was to cast anchor in the West India port where Captain Jennings resided, and invite him on board to dine with his young friend, formerly Mr. Bolton's clerk? Or if not a mariner, from dread of sea-sickness, why not measure the dry land- on the same principles by which the ocean is traversed? I will be a surveyor, and will forth- with consult Mr. Streetman, who advertises as an instructor. Thus reasoned Paul, and thus he acted. The preceptor gave him lessons in trigonometry, taught the use of loga- rithms, and how to work the area by latitude and depart- ure. Paul- was soon gratified with the opportunity of trying his hand in the wilderness as a practical surveyor. The Bank of Capetownlhad titles to an old tract of several thousand acres, which had not been run out in thirty years. The lines were to be traced and newly marked. This commission was given to Paul; and he executed it with perfect accuracy, after wading through swamps and brambles, following the meanderings of large water-courses, and with offsets falling into the old direction of the compass. His field-notes were neatly kept, and the plat of the whole survey was complimented by his instructor, who gave him a certificate of competency as a practical surveyor, to secure work of the kind when he might desire it. Paul looked upon the occupation of a surveyor as of unques- tioned respectability, since it, was followed by General Washington in the days of his youth. The first step had been taken by Paul in the rugged  duties of life, which proved more agreeable to him in the recollection than in the performance, as other scenes in which he acted a part fully demonstrated. One day Paul received a note from Mrs. Crampton, a  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7248-00000175"/> 348       MND AND MATTER: leading grandee of the city, requesting him to call at her residence as soon as his convenience would permit. What could be the object? Paul demanded within himself. Her daughter Claudine was the greatest belle in the city, just returned from the North, brilliant with beauty and accom- plishments. Paul had seen her in the streets, walking with the majesty of a queen. He was curious to know what was coming to pass; and that very evening, after tea, he announced himself, at Mrs. Crampton's, where he found two literary gentlemen in conversation with Claudine, neither of whom took any notice of Paul, who was shown to an opposite side of the parlor. Here Mrs. Crampton took her seaL and apologized for the trouble she had given Paul; but she had been informed that he was lately from the village of Tuckerton, where she had a negro mechanic at work, hiring his own time, and asked Paul if be knew the servant. The reply being in the affirmative, all the information she desired was at once given. The beautiful Claudine, in the goodness of her heart, to convince Paul that she was aware of his presence, inquired of her mother whether she had been so fortunate as to hear of Jacobus from the young gentleman. Paul then bowed himself out of the room, without obtaining any recognition whatever from the two gentlemen. They were talking the whole time relative to new works of romance, peculiar characters and beauties in them, both of matter and style,--all of which really interested Paul and sharpened his appetite for that kind of food. A paragraph must come in here as to the identity of these visitors of Claudine Crampton. One of them was the Hon. Dickson Spratt, a member of Congress, and who was afterward Governor of the State, and' died a bachelor. The other gentleman was a very eloquent member of the bar, well known at present as a learned historian and divine of the city of Gotham. Many years afterward, Paul formed his acquaintance, and rendered him some little   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.      349 civilities of a literary character, not dreamed of on the evening in question. Claudine married a merchant of the metropolis, sustains a high rank in the world of fashion, and rejoices in the appellation of grandmother! - She had but two prominent rivals in her day of conquest, the Misses Grantham, one of whom married a Senator in Congress, Mr. Harwood, and the other became the third wife of the Hon. Jonah Daws, and the mother of a governor's bride. These incidents and recollections have their rise in the history of character, by presenting an obscure youth at one time so lowly as not to be spoken to in a private ?parlor, and then by hard struggles raising himself to a social position equal to that of the literary trio, Miss Crampton and her two distinguished visitors. About this period the aspirations of Paul became more vehement for a loftier destiny. He lived in a town distin- guished for its legal ability. The first judge he ever saw preside was the Hon. Patrick Ronaldson, son-in-law of the first Governor Spratt, who was killed in a duel by the Hon. Junius Stanfield, one of the most gifted men the country ever produced. The forensic battles which he witnessed between Mr. Grayson, Mr.: Stanfield, Mr. Hawksworth, Mr. E Bryson, Mr. Grantham, Mr. Rushmore, and others of less distinction, filled the mind of Paul with daring resolves. In the first raptures of that splendid vision was laid the g roundwork of somo of the future troubles of Paul. He innocently believed that the legal profession everywhere consisted of men of similar capacity and refinement. Nor did he consider it possible that so exalted an office as that of judge, controlling life, reputation, and property, could ever fall into the hands of men who would not perform its duties gracefully, as became the Temple of Justice. With this impression riveted to his plans, he turned his mind on the glories of the law, constantly inspired by the examples which it was his hope and ambition to emulate.

Mr. Dillon Snelgrove, who had acquired a large property, re. tired from trade, and generously offered to set up Paul in business or to aid -him in any other pursuit he might choose; A course of legal studies was the consequence, under the friendly direction of the Hon. Lincoln Warfield, who was afterward a member of Congress, and for a long time an ornament to the judiciary, in which he held a high position. Paul was admitted to the bar, and forthwith tendered his services to the public by an advertisement in the papers, stating his location, and that he held the com- mission of "Attorney and Counsellor-at-Law, and Solicitor in Chancery." With his competitors in the village he soon formed the most pleasant relations. They perceived his confiding and artless nature, and gave him a fair opportunity to run his course, without a word of advice,'Which perhaps they de- clined offering, not because they did not see the necessity of it, but from the clearest evidence, in the bearing of Paul, that he would be influenced by no lessons short of experience. In this road he travelled with fearful velocity. His professional brethren were kind in a marked degree, and enjoyed his vivacity and romantic conversation. In the mean time he began to wait upon the ladies with designs of matrimony. The first Wedding to which he was invited was that of a lovely girl on whom he had set his affections, but to whom he had never breathed the desires of his heart. She became the wife of Ihitin Layton, a warm personal friend of Paul, and no unkind feeling ensued from the dis- appointment.   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.      851 CHAPTER VII. SHOWING THE MSCHEF PLA[YED BY CUPID, MTIGATED BY A PREAM OF BLISS AND THE ACTIVITY OF THE MENTAL POWERS. IN his twenty-third year, Paul looked out for a wife. At a ball on the anniversary of Washington's birthday, he was introduced to the eldest daughter of a widow in the vicinity. Helen Stewart was beautiful enough to satisfy any admirer of the sex. She was in her seven- teenth year, and was reported by her acquaintance to possess the most amiable disposition. Paul visited the family, made himself agreeable, and was so fortunate as to be an accepted lover. Fortunate was the word then, with happiness in perspective from his choice. It is true, he was not exactly delighted with the few words-very plain and unpoetic words-he could draw from the young lady while the drama of courtship was in representation; but this he attributed to that instinctive delicacy of emotion which an artless country maiden must feel in the presence of the youth she loved, who himself possessed a rare felicity of conversational talent, and whose pauses were so filled with eloquent looks as to embarrass her faculties of speech. The imagination of Paul thus interpreted, and his heart thus magnified, to his relief in the matter. Miss Stewart, as the eldest of her mother's children, had been well instructed in domestic management. Her father had been dead several years, leaving a very respectable estate, which his widow had greatly augmented by her superior judgment in the control of the farm. It is not )      i 4   &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7248-00000177"/> vow       . MND AND MATTER: extravagant to declare that'she was the model manager. Whatever she attempted she carried successfully through. She did not consider it necessary to send her daughter from home to a boarding-school to obtain those accomplish- ments usually bestowed by such institutions. The expecta- tion, and no doubt the desire, of Mrs. Stewart was that her daughter should marry a farmer, to whose establish. ment, large or small, she would be a happy acquisition. She did not calculate the chances otherwise. In her ma- ternal solicitude, no idea of a lawyer, or of any man whose mind was to be cultivated as a substitute for broad acres, had ever troubled her thoughts. For generations,: as far back as she could trace her excellent family, they were tillers of the soil, and some of them so prosperous as to be able to maintain a profuse hospitality and regular field- sports in the Old Dominion. Intellect, as a leverage-power by which heavy weights were to be lifted, by which for- tunes were to be made and honor acquired, were never so much as leard of by Mrs. Stewart or her blooming daughter. Paul at length discovered the fact; but it was too late. He dreaded his doom, yet he bravely faced it. Before the day was appointed for the nuptials, Paul made the only effort which a high-toned gentleman would deem consistent with his honor to dissolve the engagement. In an interview  with Helen, he apologized for not earlier speaking to her of his situation as to property. For him- self he was indifferent; but when the happiness of another was involved, he felt bound to make the disclosure. He then gave a brief history of his life, and of the assistance which he had derived from his patron, Mr. Snelgrove. iHe represented his prospects at the bar as not very flattering for wealth, and confessed his want of skill in- financial matters, however ardently he might pursue his profession. He   had in view what he conceived to be nobler objects than money; and if he ever became rich, it would be the natural effect of his character to'secure the confidence of **   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE. '5;- men and to justify that confidence by the services he might render. He had a passion for the supremacy of mind over matter; and, if she did not concur in this senti- ment, it was his duty to relieve her from any promise the fulfilment of which might bring gloom and suffering to her in the future. Whatever pang it might cost hini to relin- quish so fair a prize as the love and society of Helen, he was willing to make the sacrifice to promote her happiness. Miss Stewart never appeared so radiant with expression. Her face was angelic. Never before had Paul seen flashes of her soul, the sublime emanations of a glorious principle,--of sympathy developed in the highest fobrm of devotion to its object. There she sat, gazing fondly on him with her mild and trusting eyes, and then gave her decision. She admitted that a certain degree of independ- ence was necessary to happiness, and that wealth was a blessing, or it would not be so much desired by everybody. But she assured Paul that his comparative poverty should be no cause of their engagement being broken. She was ponfident that in a few years he would succeed as well as best of his professional brethren, and she was. willing to share his fortunes, good or bad. Even should the worst come,-property all taken, and he cast into prison,--s/he would cling to him and love him to the last. Paul thanked Helen for her noble declaration, and begged that a time might be named when he would have the Iri- vilege of calling her his wife and of commencing together that course in the world which he hoped would render them both happy. Up to this time, Paul had never form- ally asked the hand of Helen from her mother. He now made the application, with the same history of him- self and his circumstances which he had just given to her daughter. Mrs. Stewart paused a while from embar- rassment, but soon replied that it was her wish for her daughters to marry well, and this was the first opportunity X          30*  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7248-00000178"/>  lND AND MATTER: she had of announcing her rule:--that she would not interfere in their selection, except in a very clear case of error. As to Paul, he was not so much a stranger as to give room for distrust. From his own admission, he was destitute of property, and had nothing to rely on but his practice for a support. While she saw the incon- venience of such a condition, and regretted it, his character was too worthy to refuse. She was still more ready to give her consent from the knowledge she had of the opinions of her late husband as to suitable men for his daughters to marry. He did not make property so much an object as the personal qualities of the suitor. Viewing the matter in this light, Mrs. Stewart said that she cheerfully consented that Paul should marry tHelen, and that they must agree upon the time for the ceremony, as she wished to provide for a number of friends whose company, she desired on the occasion. -Paul returned to the room where he had left Helen on his mission to her mother. tie related the happy issue and the first kiss was then exchanged. In two weeks they were married i The joys of the honeynoon, or the time when Paul and Helen went to housekeeping, the blunders of inexperience, the multiplication of cares, and the whole train of vexa- tions incident to a domestic life, are not necessary to be stated They were just such as hundreds of other -be- ginners had to realize. Mrs. Stewart had sent home with her daughter such servants as were necessary to perform the drudgery of the household, and had also given her some articles of furniture, which, added to a supply Paul soon ordered from the cabinet-maker, answered to adorn a neat little dwelling, where two loving hearts beat inhopeful unison. Paul devoted himself more ambitiously than ever-to his profession. As will always be the case when the people see a  man exerting every nerve to accomplish a laudable   A O'K'USTY ' OFUDlMESTIUC IlE.   30a object, they will extend a helping hand. -So Paul found it.. Clients came in goodly number. Young men who had just arrived at twenty-one years of age, with whom their guard- ians did not settle to their satisfaction, sought his advice, and had bills of discovery and account instituted. Ad- ministrators who had been for years in the habit of making out their returns erroneously, charging themselves several' times with the same items in different forms, through igno- rance of the debit and credit side, were alarmed at certain recoveries amid such confusion, and they employed him -to rectify the mistakes before it was too late. In this way, the records of probate often passed through his hands, with proper scrutiny, and he had quite a laborious task in making out- a list of errors and convincing the judge of his duty to pass the necessary orders in each case, disentangling the confusion. But the compensation he required for this wear and tear of his body and mind made it an object to obtain this kind of practice, so entirely different from what fell into the hands of the other lawyers of the village. The experience Paul had in the counting- room, in the use of day-book, journal, and ledger, with the yearly balance-sheet, qualified him for this labor. He I made out his reports with such mechanical neatness and precision of detail that all who glanced at them could understand wherein the error was committed and how it ought to be rectified. This facility in accounts secured him a large equity practice, in which he simplified the pleadings by cutting off all the tiresome and useless repetitions and verbiage which were insisted upon in the form-books. And in preparing answers to the bills of other counsel, he was not the less expert. He took up the allegations one by one, detected the meaning when possible, and admitted or denied them explicitly, without any evasion. To hear his bills and answers read, even non-professional minds at once understood the, matter at issue; and especially were  &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7248-00000179"/> the jury assisted by these direct and intelligible state- ments. In the mean time, a large common-law practice also accumulated on his hands, and he bade fair to realize his best hopes and the kind wishes of his friends. CHEAPTER VIII. POINTING OUT HUMAN INFIRMTIES, THE DANGER OF MALICE HEAVY AWARDS OF THE LAW, AND THE FINAL TRAGEDY. PROM the success attending his legal efforts, Paul Clayton began to indulge political aspirations. Helen was every thing to him, and he could imagine no preferment to him- self in which she should not participate in all the social advantages it afforded. Thus, were he elected to the Le- gislature, he would take her with him to solace his cares and to act her part in fashionable society, giving her its improvement, with the possibility that its -hollow forms might react upon her in a method which he still hoped to accomplish.  It has already been stated that Paul disco- vered a  little too late for his own happiness that Helen was deficient in literary cultivation,--that her soul existed in the tangible alone, such as fine houses and furniture, carriages, silks and satins, pigs, poultry, and vegetables. If he could lead her taste into a higher region, where she might experience mental joys,-with an active and refined imagination always abounding in pictures of the beautiful and- the good,-he would then aim for still higher places in the world, not deeming the path to Con- gress impossible to win, nor the still more dazzling title of "His Excellency the Governor" beyond the reach of talents, experience, and integrity in this free land where every citizen has equal privileges. To qualify Helen for such fortunate emergencies, Paul                       4   lost no time after marriage in procuring the best magazines and most attractive literature of the day, which he took pride in laying before his wife, with just commendations of their merit, and especially the apt engravings which re- lated to domestic life, such as a young mother holding her, first child in her lap, and the father reaching out his hands to coax its little arms into motion. Helen understood the device, and looked more tenderly into the face of Paul. But he was grieved to find that, after merely looking at the captions of the articles and glancing over the plates, no further use was made of his presents. It was rarely that Helen read so much as a page; and she confessed that she had never read any book throughl in her life! Year after year this gentle contrivance to beguile Helen into a love of letters was kept up by Paul, in the hope of ultimate success. To his utter dismay, he found that by multiplying these gifts and increasing their value, even by the present- ation of the richest annuals, he was only provoking her disgust. The conviction overwhelmed him with agony, and from that hour the happiness of Paul was blighted. /Imagine a young man with the capacities and emotions of Paul Clayton, such as they have been described in this story, perishing for the want of sympathy,-imagine a proud eagle caged under a wash-tub, or Jupiter fed on straw, or a living man tied to a corpse,--and the reader will have some idea of the misery of Paul. And the cause of it has been stated,--the aversion of his wife to all the pleasures of intellectual cultivation, and her inability .to value the qualities of a man above the rude materials of brass and clay. Let the sufferings of Paul in this respect influence young people to read each other carefully before the die is cast,--before they enter into the most binding and sacred relation,-a relation which contributes more than any other to the happiness or misery of the parties forming it. But Paul rallied, and went forth in public as though no lightning-bolt had riven his soul. He kept his sorrows to  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7248-00000180"/> 358       MND AND MATTER: himself, and by increased activity in his profession endea- vored to forget them. About this time, he was called upon to act as a peacemaker between two of his fellow-citizens who had been at variance many years from a very insuffi. cient cause. ,They had been in the habit of saying hard things of each other, and both were men of large pro- perty. Mr. Nimrod Sharp had reported among his neighbors that Mr. Ludwig Cross had stolen a sheep, and, as a return compliment, the latter had accused the former of stealing money. Both were personal friends of Paul, and had em- ployed him occasionally when they had business in court. Nimrod called on him first after the slanderand stated his grievances,-how that the infamous Ludwig had blackened his good name, which he had- been trying from youth to old age to maintain honest. Paul looked earnestly in the face of Mr. Sharp, and told him that he was not in the least degree injured, nor could he be injured by any thing his adversary might say, where they were both so well known. "No one knows better than yourself," said Paul, "that Mr. Cross is above stealing: he is an intelligent man, has been judge of the county court, is obligingto his neighbors, and has a most interesting family, He has land and slaves, and is a skilful planter. You quarrelled, and in the heat of passion you both made charges which neither of you believe to be true. The best way is not to notice it, and \the foolish story will soon die of itself." But Mr. Sharp X sisted upon a writ being filed before return-day was out; for he knew that his enemy would bring an action for words spoken, and he wished to be even with him, so that one judgment might stand against the other. Within a day or two thereafter, Mr. Cross presented him- self for advice. He had been audaciously slandered by that abominable blackguard and pest to society, (as he called him,) Nimrod Sharp; and he wanted an action brought forthwith, to give the slanderer an opportunity to prove his (,   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.    359 charge. He did not want his money, and would not have it if recovered; but he desired to transmit a fair name to his children and to leave his vindication on record, Paul adopted the course he had pursued with the adverse party,-remonstrated by saying that no harm was done; that, though Mr. Sharp had accused him of larceny, no person believed it, not eve Sharp himself, whose object was merely to exasperate, nof to degrade, him. Paul then related that Mr. Sharp had been to see him on the subject, to engage his services, which he had promised, if the parties went to law; but that he had advised Mr. Sharp as a friend to forbear, and he would say the same thing to Mr. Cross, from the best motives,-to preserve the peace of families and that of the whole community; for if once they began litigation, a flame would be kindled between their grown children which it would be impossible to extinguish before it resulted in violence. The advice was disregarded. Actions for words spoken were brought by and against each other, and on the trial there was a recovery of six thousand dollars in the case of -Cross vs. Sharp, and of eight thousand dollars in the case of Sharp vs. Cross. Paul was of counsel for Mr. Sharp in both cases. The defendants appealed to. another jury, and continued to say hard things of each other. Sharp con- sulted Paul on the propriety of bringing a new action for words spoken since the trial, which he declined, believing that the public had been sufficiently annoyed by these pri- vate quarrels, as they had consumed several days of the court in the examination of witnesses and arguments of counsel. Another professional gentleman was applied to for the action, who brought it, ahd in less than a week all the cases abated by operation of law. The details of the frightful tragedy which closed all pro- ceedings on the civil side of the court will not be given. Sharp was killed by a son of Cross, after an altercation which the former had provoked, as was clearly established  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7248-00000181"/> 360       MND. AND MATTER: X  on the trial for murder, which resulted in an acttal, after a week of laborious investigation before the- court and jury. The unfortunate Mr. Sharp had been a soldier in his youth, was an honest man, but irritable and, malignant, and had the weakness to believe that to forgive an injury was nothing less than the rankest cowardice. He had not seen a day in the last twenty years when he was at peace with mankind. Several feuds were always on hand, some of them occasionally. leading to the exhibition of weapons and violence which the civil magistracy could alone sup- press.. While the action's for slander were pending, the Rev. Philbert Saltzburg, a neighbor of the parties, and sustaining a pastoral relation to their families, addressed a note to Paul, requesting him as a peacemaker to use his influence with Mr. Sharp to adjust the unhdppy strife, which was every day growing more painful in its conse- quences. Mr. Saltzburg said he was authorized} to assure Paul, in the capacity of a mutual friend, that all the charges against the integrity'of Mr. Sharp would. be withdrawn, if he swould do the same -thing toward Mr. Cross, as the characters of both were publicly known to be above re- proach in that respect, and- that all litigation :and hostilities should cease, even if the parties could not resume their social relations with each other.. This was an, agreeable office, and accorded with the de- sires of Paul, who, as already stated, had exerted himself -to prevent a resort to the law for redress against imaginary injuries; for none real. had been inflicted by the tongue of either Sharp or Cross, in-their rivalry of abuse. Paul had an interview with his client, MrsSharp, to whom he opened the subject in his very happiest manner of conciliation, and was proceeding to give reasons which ought to satisfy his client, when the latter interrupted him with: these rener- getic words:--"I will listen to no acknowledgments, and if you' are my friend, I beg you to press the subject no t    A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     361 farther. I never forgive. God hates a coward, and I want to die cursing my enemies." The prayer of the unhappy man seems to have been granted, in the manner of his death. Another tragic occurrence followed in close proximity, and may have been more or less influenced by the fatal result just noticed. A gentleman of the most princely heart, who had ex- tensive means to do good, and who was the warm personal friend of Mr. Sharp and Mr. Cross, had interposed his kind offices to reconcile the 'parties to each other, after the effort of Paul had proved unavailing. Mr. Truman Holland possessed the nicest sense of honor, and would at any time have sacrificed his own life rather than advise a friend to do what was morally wrong. He had, in every form which propriety could sanction, appealed to Mr. Sharp to accept the advances made by Mr. Cross and to let the matter end. -Age had touched both, and both had grown sons and daughters, married and single; and the contest, if main- tained, would involve other parties, who had no concern in the origin.. But the appeal was wholly in vain. Mr. Sharp seemed to rush upon his destiny. After he was killed, and the entire family of Mr. Cross had removed to another State, the noble intercessor felt wounded in his mind at the loss of two such intimate companions, and destroyed himself by suicide! He reproached himself with having deferred his labor of peace until too late a period, or with the imperfect manner in which. he executed it. He knew he was in the confidence of both, and bad never I before been disappointed in any request he made of either. Such was the tragic termination of proceedings of which Paul tried to prevent the inception. 31  &#xD;<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC7248-00000182"/> 362       MND AND MATTER: CHAPTER IX. WHERE THE HUNT IS BEGUN, AND LARGE FORTUNES HANG UPON THAT WHCH HAS BEEN LOST FORTY YEARS. A VERY important question in regard to land-titles arose, involving not less than five hundred thousand dollars in value, in which Paul was consulted professionally. The State had granted twenty thousand acres of land to Bradford Tompkins, soon after the American Revolution. The land had since passed into a variety of hands, in tracts from two hundred to five thousand acres each, and comprised the very best portion of the district, generally well improved and in a high state of cultivation. The title was traced back to Romaldo Jenkinson, who was a man of large fortune and a successful operator in lands He had-conveyed the parcels covered by the grant to a number of individuals, who in turn had conveyed to the tenants in possession. Hearing of the great claim of Trinity Church for some fifty acres in the heart of the city of New York, worth several millions of dollars, and that the lease of ninety-nine years had expired, the only tenure by which it was held, Hugh Tompkins, a son of the original grantee, took the opinion of counsel on the validity of .his claim to the whole twenty thousand acres, as there was. no deed on record, and none ever heard of, from his father to any person whatever. He was advised that his title was unquestionable in law if not barred by the statute of limitations, which commenced running from the time an adverse possession began under color of title, saving only the rights of minors, fenies covert, and certain other parties laboring under legal disabilities. a   A STORY OP DOMESTIC LIFE.     363 Hugh Tompkins was the only child by a second mar- riage, was the sole heir, just twenty-seven years of age, and a sprightly bachelor. Should he recover this pro; perty, he would be one of the wealthiest men in the country. The prize was worth contending for. He com- menced actions of ejectment against some half-dozen per- sons who were in possession. One of the tenants, Jabez Killegrew, brought to Paul a copy of the writ which had been served upon him, with a very polite note from Richard Roe informing him that he must answer the demand of John Doe, as he, the said Richard, would suffer judgment by default, and disagreeable consequences might follow. Mr. Killegrew desired to retain him on the defence of his five-thousand-acre tract, which, with the improve- ments and machinery on-it, could not be worth less than two hundred thousand dollars. An abstract of title was then made, link by link, from the present owner back to Mr. Jenkinson, forty years; but no deed could be found from Bradford Tompkins, the original grantee. If the plaintiff could prove-of which there was very little doubt -that he was the lawful heir of Bradford Tompkins, the case would be fully made out by producing the grant to his father, and the tenants would have to surrender their land. A similar opinion was expressed by all the other attorneys who had been consulted by the several parties sued. The prospect was gloomy,-even distressing; for most of them would be ruined by a recovery. It happened that Paul was quite a collector of auto- graphs, not only of distinguished public characters, but of the signatures and scraps of writing of the old men whom he recollected in his childhood as the neighbors and friends of his father. In one of the examinations of family papers which he was requested to make for certain deeds, Paul came across a bond for titles whih had been executed forty years before. The bond was conditioned to make such title to the obligee as existed in Erasmus Birchall, deceased, K  &#xD;<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC7248-00000183"/> 864  '     MND AND MATTER: and was attested by Josephus Birchall, for the sake of whose signature alone Paul had requested that the worthless paper might be given to him as a keepsake; for the old man Jo- sephus had instructed Paul in his boyhood, and had set him many copies, not a line of which he had preserved. The old bond was, of course, given to Paul, as it was of no conceivable value whatever, was barred by the statute of limitations, and the obligors had removed to the far West and were supposed to be dead.        y Paul was one day assorting his autographs and adding others to his collection, when the signature of his old teacher, Birchall, attracted his notice. He had always looked upon it with a-sort of reverence, even though he had often experienced the first syllable of his name in a somewhat disagreeable form. Still, he loved to think of the old man and of his many acts of kindness. Paul read the bond over, and, to his astonishment, found- that it related to a tract of six hundred and forty acres which was a portion of the Tompkins grant! The bond recog- nised title in Erasmus Birchall; and now, by possibility, the deed from lBradford Tompkins to Romaldo Jenkinson might still be in the custody of the fam'ily, children, or grandchildren of Erasmus, who all resided in other States. Paul knew the section of country to which the particular friend of his childhood, West Birchall, a son of Erasmus, had removed many years before. Addressing a letter of inquiry to the clerk of the court for the name, Paul was informed that West Birchall was dead and that his chil- dren had gone to Missouri. Other letters of the same kind were despatched in that direction, and among the replies he thought he discovered a ray of light as totlhe Birchalls. Some of the brothers resided in Florida, one in Alabama, and another in Mississippi, to each of whom, after patient search for their address, Paul introduced himself by letter as a schoolmate of West Birchall. The request was. made of each to, examine the old family papers, to ascertain if   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     365 there was among them a deed from Bradford Tompkins to IRomaldo Jenkinson. It appeared that no particular mem- ber of the family had taken the papers in charge. During his life, West Birchall had preserved the compass, chain, Jacob-staff, and the case of plotting-instruments of his father, which he had used as a public surveyor. Who of the children of West still held the box of survey- ing-instruments, which probably contained the field-notes and documentary evidence on which the surveys were founded? CHAPTER X. PROVING HOW DILIGENCE IS SHARPENED, AND THE VICTOR'S WREATH WORN AFTER DIFFICULTIES ARE CONQUERED, ALL FROM A VERY SMALL CAUSE. THE chase began to be interesting, and Paul became fully awake to the magnitude of the crisis. No person had seen the old compass fortwenty years, as none of the'family had any use for it. If preserved at all, it must be in some garret or outhouse used for storing rubbish. $his informa- tion was not explicit enough; and Paul next inquired of Christopher Birchall, the oldest son of West, if any large amount of Continental money was yet in thei family, as -the United States Government was in honor bound to re- deem it; and as there was a full treasury, with a majority in Congress anxious to empty it in order to raise more revenue from a protective tariff, there was a possibility that the Continental money might come in for a share of the public appropriations. This stirred up the'energies of the whole Birchall family. All searched overy box and sack that contained papers of any kind, in the hope of finding the old worthless currency, now tq e turned into gold. The box with the compass in it vs found in the /        -:' "*   'l  * 1, * f   o     n in  &#xD;<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC7248-00000184"/> 366       MND AND MATTER: hunt for gold, and in the box was a large bundle of land. papers, such as grants from the State, and deeds from indi- viduals, deposited with the surveyor to describe the bound- aries within which he was to work in checking off a large tract into subdivisions, as each particular sale might re- quire. Paul Clayton won the victory! In a letter folded on a larger scale and much heavier than any he had before received in his correspondence with the Birchalls, there was the identical genuine deed, bearing date May 4, 17-- for the whole twenty-thousand-acre tract of land, from Bradford Tompkins to Rimaldo Jenkinson, regularly sealed and attested.   ,         t  In the same package, information was given that the old deed was of no service, asI it conveyed nothing to the family. Erasmus Birchall had informed his children that while he acted as surveyor he made a verbal contract with Jenkinson to lay off the whole tract into such quantities as he might desire, in consideration of six hundred and forty acres, being one square mile, for which he was to( receive a deed; that Jenkinson placed the original deed from Tompkins in the hands of the surveyor, so that pur- chasers might see the title they were buying; that Birchall had sold his claim to Jemison Shultz, a neighbor, with agreement to execute him a deed when Birchall should receive one from Jenkinson for the square mile of land. Birchall died without either receiving or making a deed; and it was to place this verbal contract upon the best foot- ing the case would allow that Eleazar Birchall (a son of the deceased Erasmus) and Ellington Blackford, a wealthy relative, executed a joint bond, dated February 10,17-, to convey to Shultz and his heirs such title as existed in the estate of Erasmus Birchall; and to this bond Josephus Birchall, a brother of Erasmus, was the subscribing wit- ness; and it was this signature alone that induced Paul to crave the paper from Fernando Jarvis, who had married Henrietta, the only daughter of Jemison Shultz, deceased.   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     367 There was no idea entertained at the time by any person living that the old autograph would quiet the possession of five hundred thousand dollars' worth of, property, or perform any other office than to be looked t for the name of "JOSEPHUS BIRCHALL," written by his own hand, which simple fact rendered it precious to but one solitary being in the world, and that was Paul Clayton, who loved even the ground which the friends of his childhood had walked upon. Before this discovery of the important deed which com- pleted the chain of title, two of the defendants had com- promised with the plaintiff, and paid half the value of the land for which they were sued,-one a three-thousand-acre Atract, worth fifty thousand dollars, and the other tract of eight hundred acres, valued at twenty thousand dollars, the half of which Mr Tompkins received in money and gave full acquittances. The other defendants concluded to see the game out and either retain or lose all. There was great excitement among the people, who were gene- rally opposed to the old rotten claim of Tompkins, as they called it. As the trials drew ne-public opinion was more noncentrated and freely expressed- At length the court was held. The crowd in attendance was very large. Paul was engaged in the first and fifth ejectment cases as they stood on the docket. The remain- ing four cases were in the hands of other counsel, with whom he had no regular consultation. They had casually talked together about the defence, and the only defect in the title which was common to all the defendants,-the absence of the deed from Tompkins to Jenkinson; and how that chasm was to be supplied was the great difficulty. It happened that the case of Doe on the demise of Tompkins vs. iillegrew was the first called,-Timmons and Gilbert for the plaintiff, Clayton for the defendant. Both parties announced themselves ready. Theplaintiff's counsel submitted in evidence the grant from the State to Bradford                .  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7248-00000185"/> 368       MND AND MATTER: Tompkins, and proved the fact of heirship, closing by proving possession of the premises in the defendant, and the value of the mean profits. All the defendants in ejectment, with many of their neighbors and friends, were present, trembling for the issue. They knew that the decision in this case would control all the other cases, which stood pre- cisely on the same footing. Paul Clayton rose in his usual calm and grave manner, and briefly opened the defence. The first piece of evidence he offered was a deed from Calvin Perry to the defendant,- then the other deeds back in succession, including the deed from Romaldo Jenkinson; and then he paused. Counsel for the plaintiff looked pleasantly at each other, and then on their client, who sat between them. The court requested Mr. Clayton to proceed. for, if he rested his case there, it would instruct the jury that no title had been proved in the defendant. The deed from the grantee must be pro- duced, or accounted for in a legal manner. At this mo- ment an oppressive silence prevailed throughout the court- room, while the breathing of the multitude seemed to be suspended and their hearts to beat almost audibly. All eyes rested on Paul Clayton. He took from a bundle before him an old, stained piece of paper, which he informed the court was a deed from Bradford Tompkins to Romaldo Jenkinson, bearing date the 4th of May, 17-, for twenty thousand acres of land, in which was included the tract sued for by the plaintiff. There was a decided buzzing of, voices and moving of feet in the audience. The counsel for plaintiff quailed before the ancient and conclusive document. If that deed were admitted, the splendid fortune to be realized by these actions would vanish like a breath of air. On the part of the plaintiff, it was insisted that the execution of the deed must be proved before it could be read to the jury. The court inspected the deed, saw that it had all the marks of verity, and decided that, as it was more than thirty years   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     369 old, the instrument proved itself,-the law presuming that the witnesses to it were dead. The deed, therefore, must go to the jury. Mr. Clayton remarked that, to remove all doubt in the matter, he would prove, by an aged gentle- man present, that the signatures were genuine. The wit- ness, Mr. Jordan Dillahunty, was then introduced, who said that he was acquainted with the handwriting of Barnabas Small and Fairfield Green, the subscribing witnesses to th* deed, and that he had also seen Romaldo Jenkinson sign his name. From the opportunities the witnress had to know their handwriting, he was confident that the signa- tures to the deed were genuine. He further testified that the witnesses to the deed were long since dead. The court inquired of counsel whether they intended to argue the case to the jury. Messrs. Timmons and Gilbert, together with Mr. Russell, an experienced counsellor, con- ferred a while with their client, and replied that they would not consume the time of the court by argument, but would leave the court to give such instructions to the jury as it might deem proper on the evidence. Mr. Clayton signified the same course on his part. The court thereupon in- structed the jury that the defendant had fully established his title by regular deeds from the grant down, and that all they had to do was to render a verdict according to tle evidence. Without retiring from the box, the jury found for the defendant; and thus ended the celebrated litigation of Tompkins vs. Killegrew and othlrs, which had threat- ened innocent families with ruin. Paul Clayton received the warm congratulations of his friends on his brilliant success, and expressions of grati- tude from all the defendants in ejectment. They called him their benefactor, and vowed everlasting friendship; and he had -only to name the compensation that would satisfy him. He said he was no less rejoiced than they were at the result. It was a long and curious history, y  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7248-00000186"/> 370       MND AND MATTER: which he would at a more convenient time relate to then: this finding of the deed from Tompkins; and then the2 could talk over any little matter of business. CHAPTER XI. UNFOLDING TRUE CHVALRY OP CHARACTER, AND THE CONSE, QUENCES OF DISCRETION, MTA A TRAIN OF HAPPY EyENTS. THERE was a dashing cavalier, by the name of Hotspur Hastings, Esquire, whose habits were not the most eligible that could have been d4ired by friends; but still he was intelligent, brave, and generous, and had a most agreeable, manly address. He was the personal friend of Paul, and took frequent opportunities to be in his company, all the while manifesting such esteem as no man could fail to appreciate. Mr Hastings started in life with a large property, which in five years he had considerably reduced by an expensive management. He travelled in a style not below the- dignity of his name and his fortune; and that was expressive of large sums of money.' Sis personal attire was in the highest fashion and of the b'est material. What time he passed at the old family mansion, where he kept fine horses and dogs, and open house for the enter- tainment of his friends, he generally had about him a gay set of young fellows, who delighted in wine and cards and who had no further use for time than to kill it by the most gentlemanly neglect. His father had been a  lawyer of high reputation, and-had amassed a splendid fortune for his children, all of whom died but his eldest son, Hotspur, and his third daughter, Florine Hastings, a lovely girl, who as admired as much for her good qualities as she was sought in marriage for her wealth. One of the leading men of the day was Colonel Willard   JJ 5     A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.-    371 Ellsbury, who had a daughter just from school, as beauti- ful and accomplished as the fondest father could desire. Sophia Ellsbury was the gentlest of her sex, frank in her disposition, and a great admirer of nobility of spirit. She had been waited upon by Mr. Hastings with a view to matri- mony, and his suit had been favorably entertained. In the mean time, however, Colonel Ellsbury had taken pains to inform himself in regard to the habits of his future son- in-law. He regretted to find out many things compre- hended in the word dissipation,--that overflowingc joyousness of youth and buoyancy of spirits with which all of us can sympathize, though we may reprove its too wild manifest- ations. Colonel Ellsbury apprized his daughter of the habits of her lover, and gave her to understand that his visits must cease. 'She was much wounded by tie intelli- gence, and ventured to doubt the correctness of the rumor which had reached the ears of her father. .She was per- fectly willing, however, to be convinced; and, if her father would invite Mr. Clayton to dine with him, the truth might be elicited from that gentleman, who, was in a position to speak frankly and advisedly on the subject. The visits of Mr. Clayton to the Ellsbury mansion always afforded pleasure to the inmates. On the present occasion he was invested with more than ordinary importance. The colonel invited him to a seat by his daughter, and begged that, as a particular friend of the family, he would answer certain questions which involved the happiness of his daughter. The affectionate father then stated that Mr. Hastings had offered himself to his daughter and that she had reciprocated his passion. The affair had not proceeded to an absolute engagement, but would probably reach that point on the next visit, as he was then promised a definite answer. His daughter preferred hearing from the lips of Mr. Clayton what he knew in regard to the habits of Mr.  Hastings,-whetherhe was so far established in his errors, drinking and gaming,-as to make it dangerous to bring  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7248-00000187"/> 372       MND AND MATTER: him into the family, at the imminent risk of his daugh ter's peace and happiness. Mr. Clayton protested that his q'Uation was one of ex ceeding:delicacy,-that he was avsouch the friend of Mr Hastings as he was of Colonel Ellsary and his daughter,- all of whom he held in the highest'e steem. He asked the colonel to relieve him from the disagreeable position in which he was placed between Miss Ellsbury and her gallant admirer. The father and daughter both insisted that he should give his opinion, saying that if he declined doing so, and Mist Ellsbury should prove unhappy by marrying Mr. Hastings, she could not do otherwise than charge her misfortunes to the indifference or false delicacy of Mr. Clayton, the trusted friend of the faniily. This view of the subject was so explicit that Mr. Clayton no longer hesitated. He then gave a plain, faith- ful history of Mr. Hastings, exhibitittg;iall his faults and good qualities with equal candor. He Clpsed with the re- mark that, though the request imposed; on him the dis- agreeable duty which he had performed, he must, in justice to himself, say that, if he had a daughter situated as Miss Ellsbury was, he would think hard of any, friend who would refuse to save his daughter from the impending danger out of a mere pride of etiquette. Miss Ellsbury thanked him, and assured him it was the most satisfactory proof he could give of his friendship for "her and her father's family. When he next called to receive the final reply of Miss Ellsbury to his declaration of love, Mr. Hastings was met by-her father, who remarked that he was authorized by his daughter to say that she was too indisposed to afford him an interview, and that his visits, he would add for himself, were no longer desired by the- family. Mr. Hast- ings demanded an explanation, which Colonel Ellsbury gave in a few words:--that his irregular:habits made him an unfit companion for his daughter, who had received full   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     373 knowledge on the subject, and that as a gentleman he would not obtrude himself upon her society until he had given the most satisfactory evidence of reform. The mortified Mr. Hastings looked around for redress. He at once suspected that Paul had been in his path, as he had heard of his dining at Colonel Ellsbury's a few days before. He immediately addressed him a note:- "'HAZELWOOD, June 20, 18--. "SIR:-I must pay you the compliment to say that, when a direct question is asked you, a direct answer will be given. Such is your character; and I therefore expect to be informed whether you have at any time alluded to me in the presence of Colonel Ellsbury or hisodaughter, in terms calculated to prejudice me in their estimation. Your obedient servant,     H. HASTINGS." The reply is here given:- "COTTAGE GROVE, June 21, 18-. 'SIR:--I yield to your demand for certain information, and do not hesitate to say that I have, spoken of you to Colonel Ellsbury and his daughter, at their request. Truth, and a proper regard for Miss Ellbury's happiness, compelled me to say things which might be interpreted to your pre- judice,-such as that you were in the daily habit of getting intoxicated and carousing with a set of wild companions. What I said was strictly true; and I hope you will be satisfied.     Your obedient servant, P. CLAYTON." ' On reading this/Foote, Mr. Hastings did not waver long in the course he thought proper to pu-sue. He addressed a message in these words:- "HAZELWOOD, June 22, 18-. "SIR:--You have fully justified my expectations, and admitted the use of my name in a manner which leaves 32  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7248-00000188"/> 374       MND AND MATTER: me no alternative but to invite you to the field where genb tlemen- of honor usually terminate their disputes. My friend Mr. Hyson will make the needful arrangements in my behalf.    Your obedient servant, -H. HASTINGS." A shape had been given to this matter which demanded all the address of which Paul was capable. If he declined the meeting, it might give rise to insinuations wholly un- founded as to his personal courage. It was generally known that Mr. Hastings was a good shot, and had kept himself in practice for just such emergencies ever since he was of age. Besides, Mr. Hastings was really a noble, hearted and chivalrous gentleman, and aside from his in- temperate habits and frolics, in which there was nothing criminal, there could be no possible objection to him. Paul Clayton appreciated the chivalry of his character, and so moulded his reply as to cause a sober interval for re- flection. He thus disposed of the hostile note:- a COTTAGE' GROVE, June 23, 18-.. "SIR:-I accept your message. It will require thirty days to place my business in a proper situation for my clients and my family in cashe of accident to me. I have only to remark that a sense of honor and moral responsi- bility, which I cannot sacrifice, requires me to put you on your guard as to the manner in which I shall act on the field. When you arefree from the influence of strong drink, you are a gentleman in your nature and conduct; but when intoxicated, you are, like any other misguided being, entitled to commiseration. I shall expect you, therefore, to. abstain altogether from your usual exciting beverages during this whole term; of thirty days. When I face you, I shall address to you the words, 'Have you complied, sir?' - If you say, 'Yes,' I shall fire at you on the word being. given; but if you answer, 'No,' or remain silent, I shall discharge my pistol in the air when the word   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     375 is given. The idea of taking the life of a man' when he is not rational, is abhorrent to my feelings. Druqk or sober, you shall have your shot at, me, however; but you shall be denied the honor of mine unless you prove yourself worthy as I have indicated. Your reason for perilling your life is to avenge a loss which you think I have occa- sioned. If you really value that prize as you pretend, you will not subject yourself to the criticisms of the world by taking your place in a combat, protected from your adver- sary's fire. I shall be content with your answer on the ground, without deigning to have spies in my service to watch your habits. I am, Air, your obedient servant, P. CLAYTON." This communication roused the noble faculties of Hast- ings. He felt that he would be degraded to meet his adver- sary except as a sober man for thirty days. Hard as the condition was, and painful as compliance might be, he was resolved to preserve the chivalry of his name intact. But only two-thirds of the time had elapsed before he came to his right mind. He had not for many years been so long without the fumes of liquor, nor had he ever felt so clear-headed and cheerful. He seemed to himself as just awaking from a horrible vision, drawn back from a precipice over which le was stooping. He again read the correspondence with Mr. Clayton, and saw a manly, up- right principle in all that the latter gentleman had said and done in the matter. The idea flashed across the mind of Mr. Hastings that Clayton was trying to save him from ruin, after all, and, instead of killing him, he would thank him for his happy service. sThe following note was de- spatched to Paul Clayton:- "HAZELWooD, July 15, 18-. "DEAR SIR :--In training to fight you, I discovered in my- self new capacities and emotions,' which make it desirable to live, whether I obtain the hand of Miss Ellsbury or not.  &#xD;<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC7248-00000189"/> 376       MND AND MATTER: She is my only choice, and without her I see no possibility of happiness.

Say to her that I will never take another drop of intoxicating drinks'if she will let our engagement of marriage be fulfilled. To this pledge 1 Will adhere, upon the honor of a gentleman. I have only to add that the challenge is withdrawn; and I hope you will believe me sincere when I subscribe myself Your grateful friend,      H. HASTINGS." ,   This was the proudest triumph Paul had ever achieved. The court-house scene, when by his untiring and almost superhuman efforts he had saved a property of half a mil- lion of dollars to his clients and neighbors, was a trifle in comparison. He hastened to Colonel Ellsbury, and laid before him and his daughter the whole correspondence. Miss Sophia shed tears of joy; and thge colonel shouted, "Brave, glorious young man! Tell him he is welcome to my house again and to the hand of my daughter. This commission I ask of you the favor to execute with all con- venient speed. I long that he shall realize my exalted sense of his honor, which you have rescued from an un- happy fate." Filled with delightful sensations at thei result of his management, and withal pleased at his own knowledge of character, Paul lost no time in removing the burden from Hastings, and wrote him:-- "COTTAGE GROVE, July 16, 18-. "DEAR SIR :--The withdrawal of your challenge, and the manly terms in which you express yourself toward me, have placed your character in the most elevated light. I have been to Colonel-Ellsbury's, and made known to him the result of hostilities between us.

Well, my dear young friend, I have winged you at last,-not by crushing any of your limbs, but by giving you the faculties of Cupid to conquer the gifted and lovely Sophia. And may Heaven bless your union!    Yours sincerely, 'P. CLAYTON."- In less than a month,/Paul's family received an invita- tion to the wedding. He offered his cordial congratulations to the happy couple, who expressed more gratitude by their joyous countenances than they could have done by any felicity of language. Mr. Hastings and his beautiful wife are still living, surrounded by lovely children and at- tached friends. Colonel Ellsbury has been dead many years, and never lost an occasion to throw benefits in the way of Paul for the disinterested part he acted in securing the happiness of his daughter. After completing her education, Florine Hastings resided with her brother. .She knew perfectly well that his release from the shameful bondage of intemperance was owing to the exertions of Mr. Clayton, to whom she was profuse of the most graceful civilities whenever they/met, calling him the benefactor of her brother, and her own guardian genius. In about a year she addressed to Paul the following note:-  "HAZELWOOD, October 26, 18-. "DEAR SIR:--An event is soon to transpire affecting my happiness. I wish you to be present, to afford me an addi- tional mark of your esteem, as I expect soon to leave. the State under the escort of one to whom I shall be proud to introduce you. He is already informed of your generous conduct in the recovery of my brother from his social errors, and expressed a desire to know you personally.

Mr. Clayton wit- nessed the marriage-ceremony, and was presented by the bride to her gallant husband, Lieutenant Whitlock, of the army, whom she accompanied to a military station in the West, where he was in command, and where she died in about two years afterward. CHAPTER XII. TEACHING THAT NOBILITY OF MND MAY EXIST AFTER FOR- TUNE HAS DEPARTED, AND THAT THiE INSTINCTS OF FRIEND- SHP CAN DO GOOD UNDER FALSE PRETENCES. DELAFIELD MCNAB, Esq., was a lawyer of the old school, proud, formal, and very exacting in the society of his younger brethren of the bar, to whom he would never un- bend himself in social intercourse. He was thoroughly educated, of aristocratic origin, and began his career with a large estate. His style of living was extravagant at all times; and especially his dinners to the bar and to special guests were costly even beyond the prevailing custom of the day in such matters. He attended the circuit, and always sat in the bar with dignified solemnity, making up by looks of wisdom f*oa deficiency of practice; for he seldom had the offer of a fe, and would never condescend to appear in behalf of any nan whose exterior was un- couth or the facts of whose\cause would derogate from the influence of the advocate who espoused it. On one occasion he was arguing earnestly to the jury on some feature of the evidence which gave great satisfaction to his client, who happened to be near him, and who, forget- ting the place, and the respect due his advocate, tapped him familiarly on the elbow, and said, "Go it, old fellow: you make the fur fly." Counsellor McNab paused, and, f   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     379 raising himself up to the degree of explosion, gravely ad- dressed the judge:- "May it please your honor:-When outside of the bar, I can redress all indignities offered me, 'without troubling the court; but it is otherwise when I am in my place, dis- charging my professional duties under the eye of your honor. I have too much respect for the majesty of the law and its chosen administrator here presiding, to punish as it deserves the offensive familiarity just now committed by the ungrateful man whom it is my misfortune to have for a client'in this cause. His assault on my person in the most presumptuous manner while I was addressing the jury, and his vulgar commendation of my effort, force me to claim-the protection of the court. I hope such an ex- ample will be made of him as will vindicate the dignity of the coutt and the rights of counsel." The judge never relaxed his gaze. The members of the bar vied with each other in gravity of demeanor and sym- pathy with the advocate, expressing by their countenances and by Significant winks that they had a champion at last who would teach the rude country-people how to re- spect gentle'men who were generous enough to listen to their. silly complaints, even with or without a consideration, as the case might be. Such was the mood of the bar, which greatly encouraged the high tone of Mr. McNab, whose pride was quite flattered by the homage. This gravity and decorum, however, was not so real as the haughty advo- cate imagined. While he was taking snuff out of his polished silver box, and looking over the notes of his speech in the most deliberate manner, to afford the court opportunity to send his client to jail for at least ten days, the mock gravity of the bar could no longer be preserved. The judge inquired of Mr. McNab if he had any special motion to submit. Counsellor McNab folded his arms with the sternness of a Roman Senator, and said he was not previously. aware  &#xD;<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC7248-00000191"/> 380       MND AND MATTER: that the court was powerless to -punish\ an outrage whichl had been committed in its presence, to the disparagement of its authority and against all public decorum.. He had been taught by Blackstone, and all other writers on the nature and constitution of courts, -to; believe that the courts had this power, and that it was their duty to exer- cise it on all proper occasions; and if this class of insults to the court and its bar was not specified by elementary writers, it was only because that in the wide range of their experience, and in the utmost daring of their imaginations, such an extreme case had never occurred to them,--just as in the civil law there was no punishment for parricide, for the reason that it was considered impossible for that crime to be committed. It was reserved for this court, through the advocate now addressing it, to be made the first example of dishonor and contempt without a pa- rallel,-such as, "Old fellow!"Counsellor McNab declared that he had no ambition to rob his Satanic majesty of his peculiar title, and he trusted that the court would not, by its silence, sanction the application of it to him, thereby implying that an advocate is as wicked as Satan, which would cause him to be as much despised by the people. Surely such a climax of injustice and obloquy would bring down the vengeance of the court, without the stereotyped formality of amotion, which, from self-respect, he declined to make. Any junior could make a motion: he, McNab, had long since passed that, level. This was the point when a smothered roar of laughter followed in the bar, which Counsellor McNab construed T  in his favor as a cut at the judge. Throughout, the scene was the drollest ever presented on a question of dignity. Mr. XMcN!ab proceeded with his argument in the cause with increased animation and self-consequence; and, what ren- dered the advocate still better satisfied with his course, the jury gave a verdict in favor of, his client, who was so                    , #   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     381 pleased that he soon forgave, if he did not forget, the sen- sibility of his advocate. Counsellor McNab often made free with others, though he permitted no familiarities with himself. When the members of the bar were together, cracking jokds or rela- ting stories, he would select one after another for comment, giving his opinion as the, character of each impressed him. This be had done on a certain occasion with all present, except Burton Magruder, Esq., a very reserved and snappish kind of personage, who ventured to ask McNab what he thought of him. "Well, sir, since you have requested my opinion, I have to sayuthat you are a very impertinent fellow," was the abrupt reply., Magruder was a rash man; but he had the good sense to pass it over pleasantly. Hie was afterward killed in a duel by Augustin Beresford. The main object in introducing Counsellor McNab in this story is to set him forth as the representative of a class of men who, to keep up appearances merely, will endure the most positive hardship. This weakness is sometimes allied with nobility of character. In the pre- sent instance it was so, at least. McNab had wasted all his property, and was in distress. He resorted to his bottle for relief; but it only made the matter worse. His wife and eldest children had been used to affluence, and were sensitive as to -their real condition, trying to conceal it from others. In all this there was a moral heroism. A brother attorney, Everard Walton, who in his youth read law in the office of McNab, informed Paul of the situation of his old preceptor. Aside from his uniform liberality, there was a special reason in the mind of Paul why he ' should assist McNab, as the latter had also been the legal preceptor of the Hon. Lincoln Warfield, whose copy of Blackstone's Commentaries was the first ever put into the hands df Paul after he determined upon the law as a pro- fession, thereby forming a tie of personal sympathy. But how to communicate the aid was the great question. ,     ',  &#xD;<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC7248-00000192"/> 382       MND AND ;M-ATT ER: . McNab would, insult any man. who dared to offer him as- sistance: he would starve, and perhaps evoen see his'wife and children perish, before'he would accept a favor which he imagined to proceed from benevolence. Everard Walton possessed as kind a heart as ever animated the human bosom. Hie had tried many little devices and stratagems which had proved successful in affording relief to McNab's family. without wounding their pride.- But he had ex- hausted all his ingenuity, and was now at a loss. It was agreed between Walton and Clayton that they would jointly bear the expense of supplies; but how to smuggle themt into the family was again the knob of debate. Clayton thought he could manage it, and casually fell in with McNab, whom he invited to a plain family dinner. It so happened that the ham on the table was of excellent flavor; and the fact was mentioned .by Clayton to McNab, in the way of compliment t  o the grocer who furnished it. Clayton remarked that he found it more convenient and less expensive to, order his supplies for the year at one time, especially as it was his privilege to settle at leisure, when funds could be conveniently. spared from  other objects,: and, that the grocer, often had debts to collect, which he took occasion to place: in the hands of attorneys who patronized him. Clayton then eulogized the integrity of Driscoll Hyde,- the grocer, who could:be safely trusted to put up a lot. of articles suitable for family use, which would give satisfaction to any housekeeper. Clayton thought it probable that many persons in. McNab's circuit were indebted to Mr. Hyde, and that the latter would be glad to settle commissions that way. Finally, McNab consented to trade with Hyde, and Clayton was authorized to order the bill on such terms as he might think proper. The supplies for a full year were sent, charged to McNab, and a bill of parcels forwarded to him. The grocer looked to him for payment, and had sold him the articles- as to a new  customer whom Mr. Clayton had introduced. The i\    A BTUldX Uf TOOUMMTlS'Ll -DO IEI . LIE grocer was not admitted into the secret, as Walton- and Clayton would-not permit any third person to know their design. When the time for settlement came, the. sum was raised jointly, and handed over by Clayton to Mr. Hyde, as if it were McNab's money placed in his hands for the purpose.  In the course of the year,'the wealthy relatives of the family residing in another State prevailed on McNqb to return with them. Death has long since terminated his struggles; and this record is a chapter in the history of Paul Clayton, who never permitted others to suffer when he could relieve them. In this respect the generous Eve- rard Walton was second .to no man. He raised a family of children who inherited his noble nature. CHAPTER XIII. HEREIN GENIUS RECOVERS ITS ELASTICITY AFTER DEPRESSION, AND .EEK8 A NEW EMPIRE FOR ENJOYMENT---IS AGAIN, I1 TROUBLE, AND' SUPPLICATES A KINDRED   NATURE FOR RET. . THE career of Augustin Beresford was a notable one. He was the most eloquent and gifted young man in the State,-an admission which his efforts in thq Legislature , and at the bar extorted from all- parties. His literary at- tainments were the very best, - equal to every demand in legal or political pursuits.- His style of oratory was the most effective, heightened as it was by features of classical mould, an eye of intellectual brilliancy, and a voice of inde- scribable sweetness. His gesticulation was natural, and always suited tothe thought and emotion which it adorned. Such was thbis extraordinary man at:the age of twenty-five , years.    ,   &#xD;<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC7248-00000193"/> 884       MND AND MATTER: His education had been finished among wild associates who led him to the wine-cup and the card-table for enjoy ment.

Happy for him had he abstained as wel from theo er destructive vice. But he gave way to the propensit? nd soon became-a victim. The fruits of a large and s  cessful practice were absorbed by this monster passion. One of his table-companions offended him by a careless remark, which called forth a challenge to single combat. A hostile meeting resulted in the death of his adversary, and Beresford returned home with bloody laurels and a haunted conscience. While he was admired and praised for his chivalry, he felt withijhimself a sting which almost goaded him to frenzy. iHeeglected hie professional duties,.and resorted more than ever to the excitement,of the gaming-table to drown the agony of reflection. In the mean time, he had borrowed money from his friends to a large amount, to sustain himself against the losses which he had incurred. The gulf became wider and deeper constantly. He rarely permitted his clients to see him onbusiness. They complained, and de- serted him. With all his acknowledged ability and splendid eloquence, he began to lose the confidence of his friends, who made apologies for declining further advances of money. For the first time he began to see his true situa- tion,-forsaken and penniless. There was a young lady whose father, Rowell Slayton, had in his lifetime expressed great admiration of the talents of Beresford, and had remarked, jestingly perhaps, that it would be a great satisfaction if his daughter, when grown, should be -able to captivate him,--an event, how- ever, which he had not the remotest idea of ever coming to pass, as Slayton was a very illiterate man, whose know- ledge consisted in the low trickery and selfish cunning by   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     885 which he had acquired a very large property. His daughter Cornelia inherited the whole of it, after the death of two grown brothers who had been afflicted from their infancy. Cornelia Slayton had not reached womanhood when she lost her father, and was almost destitute of education. Her testamentary guardian, Albert Wimbush, at once sent her to the best boarding-school in the State, where she re- mained two or three years, and then came back a flaming belle, tall and rich. She was quite a topic of conversation, and many a fortune-hunter sighed for the magnificent prize. Among the candidates for matrimony was Augustin Beresford, who in the mean time had been informed of the alliance which Mr. Slayton had desired as'the crown of his earthly ambition. Moved by the compliment to his genius, and by the load of debt and poverty which oppressed his soul, and which the wealth of the fair Cornelia could so easily remove, the gallant Beresford became a suitor. Her guardian and relations saw the peril she was likely to incur by placing her fortune in the hands of a reckless financier; but she was so dazzled by the genius of Beres- ford, and by the prospect of a high social position to which he would, elevate her, that she rewarded his offer of mar- riage with her undivided heart and treasure. As if by enchantment, Beresford became a new man. He paid off his old debts-not less than twenty thousand dollars-out of the money which had accrued in the hands of his wife's* guardian, without touching the principal estate, and at once set up an establishment worthy of his great fortune. Mrs. Beresford soon became the centre of fashionable society; and, to do her justice, she proved her- self a queen among women. Her dwelling, her furniture, her carriage and horses, her pleasure-grounds and her ser- vants, were -all on the finest scale. Beresford had several plantations, and more slaves than any other man in that section of country. If his income was layge, his expenses were greater: yet he moved on, seemingly prosperous, and Z         33  &#xD;<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC7248-00000194"/> 386       MND :AND MATTER: had all the credit, influence, and homage which prosperity never fails to command. In the mean time Beresford had been successful in poli- tical life, and was an acknowledged 'leader. He also wielded a vigorous and polished pen, which greatly influ- eneed public -opinion- through the press. His victories were those of a conqueror. Many a battle-field could be pointed out with which his name is proudly associated to this day. -He was also decorated with the garlands of lite- rature. Many college and other kindred societies craved the honor of his name on their rolls and bestowed on him their honorary testimonials. The acme of good fortune had been attained. But there came a cloud over his hap- piness. The closest intimacy had long existed between Beresford and Clayton. Their ideals of excellence were much the same: neither could realize half that allured him to: action, and the object when attained was like a withered flower, soon to be cast aside for something else. They had fre- quently conversed together on the illusion, and the means df solid enjoyment outside of the glitter and parade of wealth and the turmoil of public life, with its cringing and unstable tenure. They understood each other well, and mut ally contributed all that friendship could devise for eack, other's -relief in the hour of trial or distress. Beresford opened himself freely to Clayton, confessed the follies and vices of his youth, and told of his escape from ruin by the timelv help of the fortune which came into his hands by marriage, and of the painful discoveries which he had since made of: the heartless world.: He spe- cified many things .which it was unpleasant to remember, - -especially the ingratitude of professed friends,and their desertion of him when their counsel and sympathy were most needed, :As :to :his wife, he owed her a debt of grati. tudewhieh he; could nwer pay. d She had snatched :him from a  yawning gulf, and- had -given him isafety and inde ; ,   iA STORY OP DOMESTIC LIFE.    -887 pcndence: still, he was unhappy. There was a secret grief if  preying on his mind which he had never disclosed before, and he did so then only to one who could enter fully into his case and weigh it 'in the&amp; true balance of. friendship,- not by any false measure of expediency or politeness. Beresford then communicated his troubles like brother talking to brother, and begged that Clayton would advise him. The latter assured his friend that he took a lively -interest in whatever concerned his welfare, and he would take pleasure in giving his thoughts at another time, when they would be better matured.  CHAPTER XIV. ILLUSTRATING UNION BETWEEN THE CIVIL AND MLITARY, THE CARES OF WEALTH, THE WISDOM OF EXPERIENCE, AND THE PLEASURES OF CHARITY. ON one of his visits to the seaboard, Paul had formed the acquaintance of Colonel Boyden, a retired officer of the army. This gentleman was the most agreeable and perfect specimen of mankind whom it had ever beet the fortune of Paul to know. He had a varied and mel ncholy expe- rience, which had wrought on his- character  In scholar. ship he was among the first men of the co ntry; and in the practical knowledge of life, with its hil s and valleys I and multiform rewards and failures, he wes thoroughly skilled, with a tact which but few men po;sessed of im- pressing others in conversation. Paul had extorted a pro- mise. from the colonel to pay hinm a special 'isit when his cofvenience. permitted or when Paul should particularly urge it upon him. The next day after the interview with Beresford related in the preceding chapter, Paul addressed a- note to Colonel Boydenj as follows:-  \ .  &#xD;<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC7248-00000195"/> aO5       MND AND MATTER: "COTTAGE GROYEr,AuggUt 7, 18-. "- MY DEAR COLONEL :--Fruit-season has come, and I wish you to taste my varieties. I beseech you to quit the into- lerable heat and dust of the city for a few weeks at least, and ruralize with me among the orchards and other inno- cent attractions of my cottage home. To sharpen your curiosity and give a new force to my invitation, I promise you the society of a friend of mine, whose talents, charac- ter, and experience will greatly interest you. Allow me to express the hope that you will comply, and thus place me under new obligations to your courtesy. With sinceve regard,        P. CLAYTON." Such an appeal could not be well rejected. Although Colonel Boyden was not much incommoded by the evils which he was advised to exchange for rural prospects, he made up his mind, and expressed it thus:-- TARRMY RETREAT, August 12, 18-. "MX  DEAR SIR :-I have no doubt your apples, peaches, melons, and other fruits are good enough for a major-gene- ral, and I thank you for your invitation to taste them from the stem; -but, if you had placed no other temptation in the way, I should certainly have indulged these lazy legs of mine by continuing to hobble about the shaded grounds of the 'Retreat,' instead of rambling with you into strange fields. But, as you allude to a friend of yours with an em- phasis which excites a lively interest in advance, I will be with you in a few days, to have the honor of his acquaint- ance, and to assure you X I am truly yours, W. BOYDEN." The next evening after Colonel Boyden's arrival, Clayton invited Beresford to tea, and the introduction was then given. After leaving the. table, the gentlemen retired to the sitting-room. It was not long before Colonel Boyden began to unfold himself, in the most simple and appropriate I I I is II H-. --- - -     A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     889 manner, as the topics of conversation happened to turn. Some reference having been made to the pontrast between things as we imagined them and as they proved to be, and that this disappointment was universal, Colonel Boyden gave his views. "When I was a -young man," he said, "I formed plans and built hopes upon them according to the probability of their realization, I entered the army as a lieutenant, and indulged my usual views of life. Nothing turned out as I 8 expected. Sucess did not elate me, nor did failure annoy me, in the degree I had anticipated. Friendship in camp was not so romantic as my imagination and the novels had painted. A joke somewhat equivocal in its application, but really not intended to reflect on me, I chose to construe into an insult, which led to a challenge; and I had the misw fortune to kill my comrade. My position required me to guard my character from; the reproach of timidity, and I was foolish enough to envy the laurels of a duellist. But, oh, how I have grieved and repented! I would this hour give the universe, w ere it mine, to have the promising young officer who fell at the fire of my pistol, back again to life. The affliction broke the heart of his mother. "The day of battle came. - My company was posted in the centre, which ji was known, the enemy wpuld endeavor to pierce. I was reckless in exposing myseef, in the hope that I should fall; for life had ceased to i of any value, from the result of the duel. But it was not my privilege to die, and thus expiate my crime, while my memory would survive on the roll of fame to gratify the pride of relations and to stimulate others to deeds of daring. The general-in-chief reported my bravery to the. War Depart- ment, and I was promoted by the President. A private letter was received from that distinguished personage, con- gratulating me on the reputation I bad won, so honorable to the service. The commission and thanks-of the Presi- dent were as blank paper. They afforded me no pleasure. 83*  &#xD;<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC7248-00000196"/> 890       MND AND MATTER;, I had other engagements with the enemy, in which I wore a charmed life. Neither cannon, nor small-arms, nol sword to sword in close quarters, could harm me. I soughl death. I was tired of life. But my desire was not grati fied. For some purpose, good or bad, I was compelled tc endure an existence which had proved a curse to me. "On the return of peace, I married the lovely daughter of a clergyman. In two years she died, leaving an infant daughter six months old. My soul revived from its depres sion, and I was willing to live for the sake of my child; but I laid her, at the age of five years, in the grave beside my angel wife. I frequently went there to weep and to recall the image of my lost ones. My heart was often filled to bursting. One evening, at twilight, as I stood by their graves, I exclaimed, 'Farewell, Louisa! farewell, Ida! .We shall meet above!' I involuntarily dropped upon my knees and prayed for the first time since I repeated from the lips of my mother. I struggled hard and long with my emotions. What agony, what hope, what peace, came from that prayer! I have since been trying to live better. "My: experience has been bitter in many respects. Am- bition and poverty waged a perpetual conflict in my nature throughout the morning and noon of life. I never had the least skill as a financier. Money was but trash in my esti- mation, compared to the elevated desires of the mind. Gold was not able to satisfy these desires, nor was honor. I assure you, my friends, that the unruly passions of our nature must be controlled by an influence above us-we must be forgiven-we must love and do good to others all the time-or we never can be happy. A selfish man, by hoarding up wealth, may appear to enjoy life; but ij; is a gross deception. I have observed too closely and too long to be mistaken. And yet, in'a certain sense, a man has to stifle the noblest aspirations of his soul to keep himself in a state of pecuniary independence. To make money in large sums, to build up a mammoth estate, or, indeed, to /  8 ' . d:   -A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     691 -enjoy even common prosperity, a man has to be selfish,- has to^lose his heart and his hand to the necessities of his fellow-beings. Hence the most godlike men I ever knew / -men who could never turn from distress as long as they had a dollar-were poor, and their generosity kept them so, in spite of their active exertions in whatever pursuit they followed. Such men have their reward within; and it is a precious reward, more to be coveted than the pos- session of wealth with a heart of marble. Still, pecuniary embarrassment is a great misfortune, and ought to be avoided. The world is too apt to couple it with dishonor. I could relate many unjust and painful instances of the Ikind, but not on this occasion, as I have already engrossed too much of your time." When Colonel Boyden closed his remarks, Beresford and Clayton were both completely under the influence of his superior mind, his graceful elocution, and his brave, affec- tionate nature. Theyjfelt that his was a master-spirit, and they would do well to profit by his society. During the ten days that Colonel Boyden remained at the cottage, Beresford was several times his companion. The two gen- tlemen were alike chivalrous, and both alike disappointed in their expectations of happiness from the world. They were often seen together alone, in earnest conversation. From that time Beresford acted more like a philosopher, and ceased to be disturbed by small things. He sold pro- perty enough to discharge all his debts, and placed the balance on a more productive footing. In the mean time his health, which had been greatly impaired by the irre. gularities of his youth, began to decline. He did not sur- vive long, and gave dying testimony which consoled his friends. It was a matter of agreeable reflection to Paul Clayton that he had thus brought together his two friends. To Beresford the result was in the highest degree beneficial, t.

The kind- hearted and exemplary Colonel Boyden has also closed his earthly career. C. HAPTER XV. SHOWING HOW TRASH WAS TURNED INTO GOLD, AND SERVICE REWARDED IN DISGUISE, WITH A REVIVAL OF TENDER MEMORIEtS. A LARGE packet was handed to Paul Clayton at the post- office. It contained twenty thousand dollars in Continental currency, which at the close of the Revolution had so fal depreciated below the specie standard that it took aboul fifty dollars to pay for a single breakfast at the inn. A letter. from Christopher Birchall accompanied the bills stating he had received information that Congress, would probably redeem - them -at some rate, and that he would gives one-half the dividend to Paul if he would represent 'the claim before Congress. The opportunity was thus afforded Clayton to. make some acknowledgment to the Birpchall family for the trouble he had caused them in ransacking their garrets and finding the deed so much wanted. The clieirts of Paul and the other defendants who derived such advantage from the timely production of the missing- deed had agreed to formr a liberal lpurse, to be bestowed as Paul might think proper as a reward. He now told them to hand over one thou. sand dollars, to be assessed among themselves according to the value of their- land, saved by the deed, and he would make a suitable disposition of it. A draft was purchased and the following letter written to Christopher Birchall who furnished the deed and the currency:-- ,    A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.    .  93 "-COTTAGE GROVE, Nov. 7, 18-. "tDEAR SIR:-The sum of twenty thousand dollars in Continental currency which you forwarded to me awaits the action of Congress. If provision should be made to redeem it, you shall have the share you designate. From the best opinion I can form, Congress has at no time thought of allowing more than ten cents in the dollar, which it is believed would be fully the amount given for the bills at specie rates by the original holders of them.  Herewith you have a draft on the Bank of Commerce for one thousand dollars, which you may consider as an ad- vance of five per cent. on the amount you sent me. If your share shall be increased by the action of Congress, it will be remitted to you. In the mean time, accept my thanks for the kind service you have been pleased to render me and those I represent by forwarding the original deed from Tompkins to Jenkinson, which proved to be valuable evidence.      Yours, &amp;c. P. CLAYTON." By this mode, disguising the real object, which was to show the gratitude of the defendants in ejectment to the man who had saved their possessions, his delicacy was not offended, whilst he had the benefit of the-d\nation on a business footing. This- discrimination is proper enough, and even tends to the improvement of character on both sides. Having accomplished in his profession and in his sphere as a citizen what might be regarded as a series of tri- umphs, Paul Clayton yielded to the feelings of his heart by visiting the old homestead where he was born and raised. Many sad and pleas ant'images lingered in his me- mory of that dear old spot. His father had died since Paul left in his nineteenth year; but his -mother still re- sided there. She reteived-him with open arms, and tears of joy and fond embraces hallowed the reunion in the family.  &#xD;<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC7248-00000198"/> 394       MND AND MATTER: The Lombardy poplars planted as twigs in the yard bJ Paul had grown fifty feet high. Other objects wery equally changed. Large oaks under whose shade he hac gambolled in childhood were uprooted by the tempest The shrubbery which he had set in the earth for hih mother had not all disappeared. Here and there an olh stem was to be seen, trying to give out new branches ani tender foliage,-a striking emblem of parental care mani -tested in the household. The old graveyard was visited There slept his father, a sister and little brother, his tw( grandmothers, and his paternal grandfather. Sturdy oak threw their giant limbs over this solitary home of the dead as if to protect it from the storm. The sleepers beneat] heeded not the weeping visitor. He was there alone holding communion with his troubled soul. By the grav of his father he dwelt long. Paul accused himself of mans acts of disobedience which had grieved his father; and i was too late now to make confession and ask forgiveness Oh- that children might know what agony they are storinj up for themselves -by rudeness to their parents! The suf ferings of Paul Clayton were-intense. Though the worlt considered him a dutiful son, he was conscious of man: departures from filial propriety. May the lesson be usefu to others before it is too late! Many of the old neighbors and their children were dead Some had removed to other parts of the country; an persons whom he had left as boys and girls were grown t be men and women. Many of them he recognised by th family resemblance, and called their names without an ir troduction. Nor did Paul omit to visit the city in whic he had served Mr. Bolton as clerk, and where he had - coi versed with Captain Jennings,--two characters speciall noticed in the preceding part of this story. The ol streets, churches, wharves, Bolton's corner, and other place impressed on his -young mind, were: seen once more, il eluding the cemetery where he mused by the graves o ^   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     395 men whose talents and-influence had so excited his youth- ful emulation. Some of the old merchants still survived, and gave him a cordial welcome. The clerks and young men with whom he had mostly associated in former days were doing business for themselves, in various pursuits. The old market-house, the same stalls, cOunters, and hooks which he had seen covered with nicely-butchered meats when he was a country lad selling produce for his father, still- kept their places. A week-was passed by Paul in the city, during all which time his grateful nature paid homage to every thing which had looked kindly on his friendless boyhood. Brigs and schoohers were still at Bolton's wharf, waiting for naval-stores, as in days of old. By perrmission of his mother, Paul examined a pile of old papers which had been kept in the family for a hundred years, with such new accessions in bills of sale, tax-receipts, store-accounts, blacksmiths' bills, and other acquittances, H with an occasional letter from a distant relative, which-gene- rations had contributed to the common stock. Some of these papers were written in Europe, in different languages. A number of scraps were selected as mementos, among which was a discharge to Walter Millwood, a schoolmate and intimate friend of Paul's fatherl certifying a term of service in the Revolutionary War under General Caswell. This document was selected from the mass ,for the signa- tures to it, and in honor of one who it was believed had long since been dead, a. very dear friend of the family. The time arrived for Paul- to take his leave; and the fare- well was solemn. Handis that were clasped and hearts that beat fondly then never. greeted each other on earth after that separation. Death has rendered it impossible. Within -a few months after..Paul's return home, he made the acquaintance, in a distant . part of the Stater of a very aged man,: who pro ved to be the identical Walter Mgillwood of whose Revolutionary services Paul held .the certificate. On inquiry, it was ascertained that the aged veteran was I. of whs  epuinay evcsPu      ed ticriiae  &#xD;<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC7248-00000199"/> 396;       MND AND MATTER.  quite poor, had broken up housekeeping, and was livin with his children. Paul asked him if he had applied for pension under the, act of CongreSs. The reply was, thb it was useless to present his claim, as he had no eviden to support it. tHe knew no person living who could testif as to his/service in the Revolution. His discharge ha been lost: he had not seen it from the time he returne from the war, when he gave it to Jeffrey Clayton, the bet friend he ever had on earth; and now, after the lapse of E many years, he had no idea that it could be found. Perhar it had been given to the children for a thumb-paper a school, or destroyed as trash. The venerable man state his poverty, and how reluctant he was to live on his chi dren, who could not well afford the expense; but it wa his only chance to pass in comfort the few days that r mained to him on earth. \ Paul then made himself known as the son of Jeffre Clayton, and, how that on a late visit to the old fami] mansion he had-searched' among his father's papers, whe he saw the discharge itself, dated in 1781. The old ma caught in his arms the child of his best friend, and e: claimed, "I love you as a son! I love you for the sake  your father! Had you only thought of it, how easily yc could have brought the discharge with you' But ye never saw me, and no doubt believed that I was dead. am rejoiced to see you, and to tell my children who ye are. Stay with us a few days, and tell us 11 about the o State." Paul replied that he would accept his invitatio: but he must first return home and bring the discharge," for he had preserved it carefully as a relic of the Revol tion. The intelligence soon spread, and the old soldier heart was made young with joy. Losing no time, Pa reappeared with the document, made out the declarati( of service, attached to it the original discharge, and fo warded it to the Secretary of War.

This was the second instance of the value of autographs which Paul had collected, securing to others, as well as to himself, a most unexpected, happy result. CHAPTER XVI. BRNGINGI  IN VIEW A GLOOMY LANDSCAPE, DARK WEATHER, AND A BRIGHT STAR, AFFORDING A NEW HOPE OF SAFETY. THE letters of Paul to his parents, glowing with heart- language and a good deal of youthful fancy, impressed his younger brother Donald as perfection itself. A few words will introduce Donald Clayton. tie was several years the junior of Paul, and somewhat better educated at the schools, as his teachers were competent, and he aspired to a know- ledge of Greek and Latin, which Paul never studied. His struggles will not be recorded: they were such as made him a superior man. Paul had advised him to a course of legal studies. He came to the bar at an early age, labored hard in his cases, and soon made his mark. Donald was most happy in his marriage with Lucy Norton soon after- ward. Her mind was richly cultivated, and her disposition angelic. It was a feast to Paul to be in her company; and when oppressed with cares at home, he frequently made her his confidante, passing days at a time at the house of his brother. Intelligence and affection, at once refined and graceful, threw sunshine in the dwelling of the young couple. Their first child was christened Paul. Nothing more is necessary to show the love of the two brothers for each other. Years rolled on, and Donald and Lucy became the happy parents of other children. He had established a high professional character, and was prospering rapidly, when his health failed. -Pot several years he-was com- 34  &#xD;<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC7248-00000200"/> F     398       MND AND MATTER: pelled to withdraw from practice and devote himself to th restoration of his strength, which had become much rn duced. He succeeded partially, so as to resume the labor of his profession. Paul and Donald Clayton had similar tastes in literature and agreed generally as to the duties of men and th manner of attaining happiness. It has been remarked, a a previous stage of this narrative, that Paul and his wif were totally unlike in their ideas and habits. He was al sorbed in the gloriesyof mind, and she valued nothing bu matter. His soul thirsted for knowledge and refinement hers cared for nothing but wealth, and the comforts ant influence it secured. Paul was of opinion that a ma: ought to be estimated according to his intellectual ant moral superiority; his wife believed that fine houses, grea display, and table luxuries were the true elements of hap piness. He was ready, animated, and various in conversa tion; she had no style whatever from books, but talked or with/common sense, direct to the purpose, careless of w ds, and without sentiment or poetry in her nature aul Clayton longed for impossibilities,-for something-noi within reach of man,-an ideal of generosity and elegance Helen Clayton was satisfied with the tangible, -that whic[ she could see and handle, eat and wear, when necessary Paul innocently persuaded himself that men were nobl beings, and were in duty bound to exert all their faculties and the means at their command, for the good of each other; his wife saw no obligation in one individual to deny himself any convenience to relieve the necessities of an- other. In fine, Paul had exalted conceptions of nature, of art, of the beautiful in the air or on the earth; in music, in poetry, or in woman; in eloquence, in animated nature, or in the vegetable and mineral kingdoms; in lofty moun- tains or in deep caves; in ships at sea, or in houses: all afforded him themes for meditation which lifted his mind above the dull earth and assured him of the immortality   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     ,899 of the soul. Helen believed in no form of beauty except bonnets, shawls, laces, silks, and other ornaments to render a woman grand in appearance and to convey the idea of wealth and power. As to the human soul, she had no fixed opinion. Her business was to make the most she could of this world, and let the future take care of itself. At night Paul tried to interest his wife by relating the curious things he had read in the course of the day, the strange trials reported in the law-books, and the droll taste of celebrated men who had fallen from their high positions; but she urned from h im, and requested him to converse about something else, or to remain silent altogether, rather than disturb her with matters that did not concern her. He was always striving to keep her energies of mind and body alive by activity. His wife had no need of such arti- fice. She was content with herself and with the condi- tion of her mind, without any special effort to improve, --of which she was not aware of the least necessity. As might be expected, two such opposite natures rendered each other-unhappy. For a long term of years did Paul Clayton bear up under this terrible cross and hope for an amelioration of his trouble; but no change came, except for the worse. He thought of mhutual separation; he wished to keep from a presence that drove him to despair; but, then, their two children, a son and a daughter growing up, would be injured by such a course. Poor innocents! they must never know the hearts of misery that beat in the bosom of their parents. Besides this, Paul and Helen had brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, and other kindred, who would feel mortified at a separation. What must he do? His wife was a model of industry and domestic neatness, of superior judgment in household affairs, and could even buy and sell property to advantage,-a  privilege which Paul desired her to exercise at discretion, as be had no skill in such transactions. Everybody that chose could easily  &#xD;<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC7248-00000201"/> 400       MND AND MATTER: cheat Paul in a trade; but no person was adroit enough t impose on the understanding of his wife. It might seen fortunate that their tastes so radically differed,--that the imperfect ideas of the one in regard to the value of pro perty might be supplied by the superior judgment of the other. Such an opinion had been frequently expressed by their friends; but it did not relieve Paul from those pange of mind which were consuming him purely from want of sympathy at home. His health began to languish, and he saw his doom written. He prayed for a speedy death, to release him from- his sufferings. Life no longer had any attractions. His spirit was wounded, his hopes crushed. True, he had acquired a fair property, which he could at any time leave unen cumbered to his family. On that score he had nothing to reproach himself with. He needed comfort within, a sweet voice to respond to his trusting and gentle nature. This he never found where he would naturally expect it, where fond hearts garner up delights for each other,--at the do. mrestic fireside. His intelligence and vivacity there had always been repulsed by oa cold, imperious, and selfish wo man, who sustained to him the sacred relation of wife, but who in fact had entirely failed to apprehend the sources of happiness,-the emotions of the soul. Mere sustenance and ornaments for the body, with a large property to boast formed the circle of her ambition and desires. And she was once a bride,--the chosen bride of Paul Clayton!   &amp; STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     401 CHAPTER XVII. WHERE A PLANK IS THROWN TO A SHPWRECKED MARINER ON LIFE'S OCEAN, AND HOW HE PLIES TO AUTHORSHP AS THE LAST REFUGE FROM MSERY. PAUL turned in every direction to escape from his troubles.- Should he still pursue the exhausting labors of the bar, or should he retire, in the prime of life and in the midst of prosperity, and seek repose in elegant leisure, or banish his sorrows by travel? These were questions which he constantly revolved in his own mind. Having confidence in the judgment of his brother Donald, he thus opened his -difficulties to him:- "I have apprized you, my dear Donald, that, owing to a disparity of views and feelings, Helen and myself do not render each other happy. In fact, my trials must have an end, or they will soon kill me. I am supremely wretched from this cause. My domestic sorrows have been stu- diously kept from the world. I am not willing to cloud the happiness of my children or to wound my relatives by a separation; and therefore I must continue to endure my misery. Can you suggest a method or an idea to direct my mind into a new channel? Perhaps in this way I may find partial relief. I must be employed at something congenial to my nature. Political warfare I despise. Of late it has become a pitiful thing, and I will not descend to it. In truth, I have but little inclination that way. Now, take my case in hand; weigh my griefs against your joys, surrounded by dear Lucy and the babes at home, where you are understood and appreciated; and then advise and console me as best you can." 2 A        34* I2           i   u  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7248-00000202"/> 402       MND AND MATTER: In a few days a letter was received by Paul from his brother Donald, as follows:- "I have anxiously reflected upon your troubles, and, without pretending to be wise, I think I can point out a remedy, if not for their cure altogether, at least to miti- gate their intensity. Your hard destiny I have long sus. pected, and I really hoped you would have communicated freely with me on the subject years ago, that I might share in what so vitally concerns you. But you thought proper to keep your troubles to yourself, beyond a mere intima- tion, from motives which I respect, though I believe them open to objection.- Between us there should never- be concealment or mystery.

Brace up, and go to work in this new field. You will soon get fairly into harness." This suggestion was approved, and Paul lost no time in communicating with the press. His articles were entirely successful, and he took up courage for a regular campaign in authorship. He visited Philadelphia and New-York, to find publishers, as in his time there were but few, if any, establishments in the South that pretended to manufacture books. The case is otherwise at present. There are now K?   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     403 publishing-houses in the Southern and Southwestern States which can issue as handsome volumes as the North can furnish. Mr. Clayton formed the acquaintance of the most prominent houses in both of the great cities, and succeeded in getting out his work, which found ready sale and re- ceived the hearty commendations of the press. For the first time, he was initiated into the mysteries of book- making, from the reader who examines and pronounces on the manuscript, to the measurer Of quantity on which an estimate of the cost is founded, then the stereotyping, the proof-reading, and, last of all, thW printing-maChines and bindery. The volumes are then ready for distribution by the publisher, who sends the work to his correspondents all over the country, unless the author chooses to publish on his own account, retaining the copyright,--in which case he himself controls the sale.

CHAPTER X V llI. EXHBITING A PICTURE OF DISTRESS AND COURAGE, AND THE INFLUENCE OF A PERVERTED MND, RESULTING IN VICTORY OVER GENTLENESS. THE domestic life of Paul Clayton again comes irn re- view. He stands before the world as an author; and it is natural that he should feel a measure of anxiety relative to public opinion, every phase of which, for or against himself, he watched carefully. Although he knew the in- differencej nay, downright opposition, ofJIelen to all books, and especially to his own intellectual labors, he carried her the papers and periodicals containing notices of his work,   &#xD;<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC7248-00000203"/> 404       MND AND MATTER:            in the hope that she would relax her enmity and award him better treatment. In Kennedy's Life of Wirt it is stated, in one of the letters of Mr. Wirt, that his great hap- piness in seeing his productions in print-the '"British Spy," "Old Bachelor," &amp;c.-was that his wife might be gra- / tified and feel a just pride in his reputation. It was not the privilege of Paul Clayton to lhave any such solace. On the contrary, in the ratio of his growth in public favor he lost the esteem of his wife. The fairest eulogies of the ! press, and the most sparkling compliments which he re- ceived in letters from- distinguished men, made no impres- sion on her, except to provoke her disgust at all such non- sense, asn she was pleased to style -it. Well might Paul droop his head and covet the grave!  But, depressed as he was, he rallied at intervals, and used his pen to work off the gloom and sadness of his heart in varied composition. It was the only relief he had; and that was obtained under a malediction. For example, his wife would see him at his writing-desk for hours together, and when he showed himself at table, perhaps a little care- worn, she would sneeringly demand what paper machine he was then putting on wheels, and in what direction he was going to roll it. Sh e would express utter astonishment that ' a man capable as he was of making one of the largest pro- perties in the land should trifle away his time and talents in scratching, scratching, eternally scratching little black lines on paper, which amounted to nothing. Such conduct was to her a mystery. He ought to be using all the means in his power,--in trading, in shaving notes, as other sensible men did, in hunting up- the largest cases in law and charging the very heaviest fees,-all of which would count some- ) thing real, instead of the vile ink and paper, not worth the quills wasted in the scratching. Shewas clearly of opinion that any man who had the ability, but would not exert it, to gain wealth for his children, would have to answer for it at the day of judgment; and that any child  't  ,   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.    405 thus neglected had just cause to execrate the memory of its father!  The lecture did not end here. Paul was reminded of the contempt with which the world regarded poor people; and any young man or young lady was poor, comparatively, who was not as rich as the richest. For her part, she would never die contented until she knew that she had more property than any of her neighbors who rode about in their carriages and dressed their sons and daughters in the most fashionable style. He was reviled for his indiffer- ence to his own dear children in this respect. Eugene was nearly grown, and Laura was of an age to finish her edu- cation at a boarding-school, so that she might come into society and make her  nquests at once. True, he had money enough to settle his children in a respectable man- ner; but that was not sufficient. They ought to be the very first in, wealth, far above all others, and be able to look down with scorn upon pretenders. This was the real glory of life; and all men of correct views made it their daily practice. Paul listened to this discourse calmly, and told Helen that their children were not likely to suffer for the world's goods. It was not the wisest policy to start young people into life with too much property; and he only regretted that he did not have enough to help every poor boy and girl to a sound education, that they might work their way to better advantage. For,his part, whenever he saw a bright and intelligent face in poverty, his soul yearned to do something for it. Paul said he felt grateful to Heaven for his good fortune. He was once a rude country lad himself, and a little assistance then would have been very acceptable. Indeed, he had no right to complain; for he had always received favors, without which it would be im- possible for him to succeed. 'He was willing to do unto others as he would have others do unto him,-a rule which. divinity alone could have prescribed.  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7248-00000204"/> 406       MND AND MATTER: "And you have turned preacher of 'divinity' at last, have you?" said Helen, her eyes flashing with rage. She was even sublime in her outhursts of tyranny and ambi- tion. Had her lot been to rule a kingdom or an empire, instead of a husband, she would have equalled Maria. Theresa of Austria, or Catharine II. of Russia, in mascu- line vigor, and would have led her armies in person if her general-in-chief had not consulted her on the plan of his campaigns, or had neglected to apply for her advice on all difficult occasions. In the common affairs of life, in agricultural operations, or in the purchase or sale of property, the judgment of Helen never failed. She had no imagination to throw a false light on any measure or object which concerned her; and she was so destitute of sympathy that she never omitted a bargain, however it might oppress another, to put money in her purse. She had no more scruples in conquering opposition, at whatever hazard, than Napoleon had in bringing ll Europe under his imperial sway. Helen Clayton as eminently fitted to make the labor of a hundred slave increase their number to a thousand in a dozen years. She would have required her managers to execute her instructions, and not to presume on following their own judgment. The least departure would have cost them their situations. Her repugnance to very poor people resulted from the belief she entertained that they were too indolent to labor, else they would not be so abject. A man or woman in rags she despised as a reptile, and thought it would be a service to them, as it certainly would be to others, to have them put out of the way, the method being legalized. She also maintained that persons who did not possess a competency to render home agreeable ought to be for., bidden by law from forming matrimonial relations with each other. To bring a child into the world to inherit misery and degradation was a great moral crime, for which the   A STOXY 'OF UDOMESTIC LIFE.    WU I parents deserved the stings of conscience in this life and perdition after death. She denied the existence of love where the necessities of the body could not be supplied abundantly and where the parties depended on the uncer- tain labor of their hands for a daily support. She loathed the man who had not the energy and judgment to place himself in a condition to relieve his wife from personal drudgery, which was abhorrent to the pride and delicacy of woman. To make her a mere machine, or a beast of burden for his convenience, was no less than brutal; and the man who would deliberately sacrifice the happiness of a woman in this manner would most assuredly be assigned a place among the goats when the great spiritual sheepfold was divided.

LAURA CLAYTON returned from school in her sixteenth year, a blooming and amiable girl. Within the last six months of her educational course, she had been attacked with a violent inflammatory fever, which enfeebled her constitution, though the roses of health seemed to adorn her cheeks. She was tall and sylph-like in figure, with clear blue eyes expressing her gentle and affectionate nature. Her neck and shoulders of alabaster were orna- mented with a profusion of auburn ringlets, which attracted the admiration of all beholders. She loved her parents dearly, They looked upon her with delight, as standing in such a dear relation to them that a compromise of their conflicting views might be made without a sacrifice of self-respect on the part of either, to render their daughter  &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7248-00000205"/> 408       MND AND MATTER: happy.

Hie was generally amotng his books when at home, and appeared to -labor under a sort of mental distress, which the tender-hearted girl would often try to alleviate by sweet words and dutiful instances.

He thanked Heaven for the precious boon, and tried to ingratiate ;him. self into the favor of his wife by hopeful allusions to the future of Laura. Helen met these advances by the very earnest remark, "Show your faith by your works. Make Laura the richest girl in, the country, as you might have done before now if you had dismissed your silly notions of literary fame and your yet more silly feelings of benevo- lence,-your extravagant charities, for which you are never thanked, and which will never contribute to the welfare of your children, except bylessening the danger of their having too much: property,-a 'famous idea which origin- ated with yourself!

The heart of Clayton never revived. Hew relinquished the few cases which he had consented to take within the last year, on account of their special importance, and which yet lingered in the equity docket. He wrote to his brother Donald,-  "I am more tranquil now, more resigned to my fate, than I have been for many years.

He was buried by the side of his daughter Laura; and two handsome monuments mark the spot in their native South. /  &#xD;<pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC7248-00000207"/> "2       MND AND MATTER: CHAPTER XX. ILLUSTRATING THE FEEBLE TENURE BY WHCH EARiTHLY POS- SESSIONS ARE HTEL]D AND THE PERILS OF AMBITION WHERE THE GOOD OF OTHERS IS NOT THE RULING MOTIVE. IN about a year after the death of her husband, when, with the assistance of Eugene, she had settled up the estate and found' a handsome property remaining, Mrs. Clayton determined to remove to the Valley of the Missis- sippi, in order to pursue more successfully her grand ideas of money-making. Eugene Clayton had just arrived at the age to take charge of his half of the estaite. He was a young man of sound morals and judgment, agreeing en- tirely with his mother as to the supremacy of wealth above all other thing s. They conferred together on plans to ac- cumulate, and, by judicious investments, they soon found themselveson fortune's track. Mrs. Clayton advised her son to keep :his property with hers in common, as in the case of her death there would be no necessity of an admi- nistration, he being the sole heir. She was to govern the whole, and apply the proceeds year after year in increasing the quantity of land and the working-force, to render the estate of enormous value. This would give him the com- mand of the matrimonial market; and at thirty years of age-which was soon enough to make a good choice--he might suit his fancy as to pedigree, personal appearance, literary accomplishments, and all other traitsof character which could render a young lady the fit companion of a rich man whose privilege it was to control society. The plan worked successfully. Trade after trade, and crop upon crop, without a single blunder or misfortune,   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.     413 brought within the grasp of the avaricious and haughty Mrs. Clayton the wealth for which she had so long sighed. She saw in prospect the enviable condition of her only living child,-master of a large fortune and wielding the influence which property secures to its possessor. Her vanity was gratified at the sensation he would produce in families whom he would h6or with his visits,-at the con- tests among fair damsels and their fond mothers for the monopoly of his favor. She beheld a flourishing posterity spring from the son of her bosom, and upheld by the riches she had provided for them. Her regrets for the loss of her husband, if she ever experienced any regret, had long since been counteracted by her eager and absorbing passion for wealth.  / Mrs. Clayton usually went each winter to New Orleans to settle with her factor and to lay in family supplies for the year. On such occasions she always appeared in a style corresponding with her wealth, and was quite vigilant in selecting the very best opportunities to advance her son in the good opinion of the young ladies from among whom she would be willing for him to make a selection. These were usually the daughters of rich sugar-planters in the interior of Louisiana, passing the winter in the metro- polis and giving eclat to the parlors of the St. Charles and the St. Louis. With one of these belles Eugene Clayton fell desperately in love, and, being seconded by his mother and their acknowledged wealth, his suit prospered to an en- gagement. The young lady was handsome, very agreeable in her manners, and inclined to be aristocratic,--which latter quality delighted Mrs. Clayton, who saw in the alliance an improvement of the blood of her family, especially that degree of it which squinted at charity to the poor, derived from her late husband. It was natural that Eugene Clayton should obey the counsels of his mother; for since his earliest recollections she had treated him with marked partiality, and had often 35*  &#xD;<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC7248-00000208"/> "4       AMND AND MATTER: bestowed favors on him to the exclusion of his sister Laura, who inclined m6re to her father's side. Eugene had dis- cernment enough to perceive this state of things; and it 9 was much: to his credit that he devoted himself to his  mother's happiness; for she had no other object on earth which she sincerely loved. He was a man of the purest honor, and had been so wrought upon by the influence of his mother in regard to wealth and the mastery it exerted over mankind, that he looked upon himself as the happy founder of a new generation, bearing his blood and his name, wholly relieved of that sympathy for people in dis-  tress which was the principal defect in his father's charac- ter, and, as it proved to be, a disastrous thorn in his domes- tic life. This opinion of Eugene was the result of his F mother's persistent teachings, to accomplish the destiny of her son,-his marriage with one of the noblest families in the country. Francenia Laporte belonged to an ancient family, which a military count had rendered illustrious. Her father,. M. Laporte, was a large sugar-planter in- one of the middle parishes, and had only two children to inherit his estate,- a son, then on his travels in Europe, and his daughter, who was affianced by his consent to Eugene Clayton. The day for celebrating the nuptials had been fixed :on the 1st of February, 1i8--. Mrs. Clayton and her son visited New Orleans during the first week in January, to prepare in a becoming manner for the happy event. They were both enraptured with the future as it stood revealed to them in all the splendor of wealth and high social rank, to gratify the ambition of the mother and to crown the bright hopes of the son. They had received a large sum of money for their cotton-crop, and had purchased every thing necessary to renovate the household for the reception of the bride. They took passage on the steamer Moselle, Captain Par-  tridge, on the Mississippi, to return home. At the hour for retiring on the first night, mother and son exchanged the   A STORY OF DOMESTIC LIFE.      415 kiss of affection and the smile of joy, as they separated for their respective' state-rooms, and were soon wrapped in unconscious slumber. On board of that splendid steamer were two hundred and eighty souls,-among them, rich planters with their families, after a gay trip to the city, young men and young maidens, travelling for pleasure and to become better ac- quainted; agents of Northern houses extending their busi- ness; artists from the city, in pursuit of Western scenes for their pencil; ministers of the church, returning from an ecclesiastical convention; graduates in medicine, with di- plomas fresh from the faculty, attesting their qualifications to kill or cure in the most approved form; miscellaneous characters, from the Puritan schoolmaster to the Western blackleg; mothers and children, masters and servants,-all shut up and borne proudly along by the gallant steamer. The inmates were all asleep, except the officers on watch, the man at the wheel, and the dusky fireman who kept up steam for the engine. At twelve o'clock, "All is well."  An hour passes, and the cry of fire is heard. "The boat is on fire!" is the ter. rible proclamation from twenty strong voices, by officers and crew. "Put her to the shore," shouts the captain to the helmsman. The boat refuses to obey the wheel: the tiller-ropes are burnt. Passengers rush from their rooms wildly in their night-garments,-husbands calling for their wives, brothers for their sisters,--and the manly form of Eugene is dashing through the crowd to find his mother. She hears hisl voice, and falls into his arms. "Be calm, mother: I will save you. Let the worst come, I can make a raft of the chairs and mattresses, on which we can float until we are rescued." And the dutiful son applied himself to the work.  The flames darted into the cabin, and drove all the pass- engers on the gangway. The mate was in charge of the yawl, to save the women and children.

The yawl was capsized, and even thbi mate himself was drowned in trying to save his helpless passengers, the women and children. Two hundred and thirty persons perished with the boat, and among them Mrs. Clayton and Eugene, soon after dropping upon their raft, which was drawn under the wheelhouse.

It is hoped that the lesson will be of service to many, as the same in- firmities exist now as in the time of Helen Clayton. Pa- rents are warned by hier example to improve the minds of their daughters and to give them ideas above the mere outward adornings. It is quite certain that Helen never heard a conversation at the fireside of her parents which tended to inspire her heart with sympathy for mankind or' to create in her a thirst for intellectual pleasures. Her parents were noted for strong practical sense, and that pride of integrity which gave to their business engagements the sanctity of honor. They permitted no debts to pass maturity; and they looked upon indifference in this respect as a,want of moral principle. They held strictly to the law of equiva- lents, value for value,--nothing more nor less. If an object of charity, such as an afflicted person desti- tute of bread, presented. himself, they gave him something to appease hunger, and then dismissed him from their door, as they did from their thoughts. A travelling beggar, especially some Italian who had been shipwrecked, or hiis estates confiscated for his republican sentiments, or his cottage swallowed up by an earthquake, which appeared from the printed certificates he carried with him,-let such a person solicit money to bring over his father and mother to America, and the dogs would binstantly called to chase 2B  , /  &#xD;<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC7248-00000210"/> "8-       MND AND MATTER: away the vile impostor! The sudden flight from her father's door of some of these wandering collectors of pence and wealth, was among the earliest recollections of Helen, and always associated in her mind poverty and the dogs as twin-brothers, which gave her such a contempt for the lower classes of people. This was the teaching which Helen received from her parents- and it was very excellent to cultivate a spirit of independence. Had other things been as well taught,-had a taste for mental improvement, and a liberal view of life, of the relative -duties of man, of his social nature, been inculeated,--all would have been right. Helen Stewart had the capacity to comprehend, and a strength of will to exe- cute, whatever it concerned her to know or perform. But her mind in youth did not receive the proper culture; and after marriage she could'never be induced to love books. -Perhaps the only occasion when the soul of Helen was stirred with lofty emotions was when Paul Clayton con- fessed his poverty, and gave her to understand that, if she prized wealth as the paramount good in life, he had no desire to connect her with his destiny. This passage has been related, and deserves to be held in remembrance for the turn it gave to the fortunes of Paul. Who does not see and mourn the consequences to him of the answer of Helen-? With her real principles, her want of appreciation of mind and her idolatry of matter, Helen was in honor bound to acquaint Paul with her convictions, instead of impressing him by the warmth and disinterestedness of her devotion regardless of his pecuniary circumstances. Her conduct in this affair can only be pardoned by supposing that she was sincere at the time, forgetting, in the elevated presence of her lover, all her proclivities to wealth as the sole charm of existence. But her prize once gained soon lost its value, and she trampled it under foot, as her con- stitutional passion for wealth revived.- And here let a word of admonition be dropped to all (   A STORY -or DOMESTIC LIFE.     419 gentle maidens who may read this true story. Should they unhappily be so taken up with the ideas of show, of mere external grandeur and luxury, that they can never be satis- fied without pomp and display, let them at once relin- quish the hope of happiness in married life.

Ponder well the history of Paul Clayton. His faculties and his heart achieved much for the good of mankind, while every hour of his married life was embittered by the worst of all calamities,-a wife whose nature was the very opposite of his own. He submitted to a lingering matrimo- nial torture more cruel than Papal Inquisition ever practised on its heretic victims. Helen Clayton was so rigid in her faith, in her worship of the "almighty dollar," that she looked upon her husband as the veriest heretic, because he would not endure the same idol. She saw no possible chance for his happiness but to turn him from the errors of his MND. In her capacity of ruler, just as the Pope thunders from the Vatican, Helen kept her victim con- stantly on the rack, piercing his soul with hot iron, with words of bitterness and looks of scorn, as if for her amuse- ment. But she was only trying to cure him of his heresy,- to make him worship her god, mammon. In the event -of her success, she intended to fulfil her pledge at the altar, to "love, honor, and obey." She practised the maxim that there is no faith with heretics; but, unfortunately, she con. tinued the process of torture too long.
