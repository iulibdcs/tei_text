IN the days of Lackland, ruler over Gotham, there arose a great controversy and process at law, whereof the promovents on the one side were my Lords Fustian, Flammer, Fizzle and Levi, and on the other the Signors Graspall, Gripewell, Cogger, Swizzle, Holdfast, Dun-up, Seedy, Sycophant, Greasyfist, Bighaul and Brazennose, as respondents. And thereat and thereover the worshipful bodies of Councillors, Sophisters, Chancellors, Doctors and Rabbinists, in communi concilio convenuti, had, for the space of six-and forty weeks, pecked, picked, plucked, canvassed and cogitated, withdut finding brim or bottom therein, at the same time confessing that'they could not with such clearness understand the case as that they might in any manner or way be able to right it, but that they were one and all at their wits ends, bedunced, philogrobolized and befoozled thereat, and not a wit able to advance therein, "Cbeati dunces quoniam ipsi stumblaverunt." And said controversy being of so high, occult and recondite a nature, the promovents did bethink themselves to submit the same to the sapient and erudite Owlet, high presiding justiciar and dispenser of eqiity in the Superlative Court of Gotham, who was held to be learned above the capacity of the age, and his coadju- tors and assessors, all high in the law and in all learning therein. And the said promovents did thereupon advise to bring the said process before them that they might well sift the same, that there might be an ending and adjustment and composition thereof, and    <pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6519-00000005"/> 4 that they might make a report thereon to stand good, of their true and legal knowledge; for, quoth they, never any will compass it to an end an' they do not, seeing how learned and well versed in the law they were. Then gat they before the Court, preceded by their scriveners, cleiks, abbreviators, notaries and reporters, bringing and making profert of the writs, plaints, pleadings, testimony and all the like proceedings, which were sufficient in bulk and weight to have weighed down ten great he asses. Now, for the promovents there appeared Sergeant Muddlehead, with whom were his juniors and associates, and for the respondents Counsellor Tornado and his adjutors; and the high Court being thereupon assembled, and the Lord Justiciar seated in the midst, with his brethren on either side; and the marshals, constabularii, ushers and tipstaffs, having well ranged and apportioned the mul- titude--for a wondrous crowd, both of the commonalty and of the better sort, had assembled to hear the issue of this great contro- versy; and the crier having made solemn oyer, proclamation and overture of the then sittings, and all the parties being summoned and personally convented; the Lord Presiding Justiciar did nod his head very gravely three times, and did thereby testify that he was prepared to listen to what they of the law then there had to propound and advocate in the then behalf and premises. Then evQay body taking heed and hearkening with great silence, Sergeant Muddlehead rose, and, after the manner of sophisters, lifting up into the air his right hand, did put the thumb thereof to his nostril on the dexter side, and then, holding rigidly extended his four fingers in a line parallel to the point ,of his nostril aforesaid, did shut wholly and close effectually his left eye winker, oculus or nose blinker, and alternately profoundly depressing and suddenly elevating his eye-brows and eye-lids, wink in such an extraordinary fashion that the Lords Justiciar then there were of a truth given to understand that no trifling matter begirt his understanding; while he seemed to all the spec- tators a man strangely ravished in lofty contemplation. Nodding his head then gravely to and fro, and mumbling and rumbling from the superficies of the 'diaphragma, through the trachean artery, a variety of articulate sounds, which do ever prelude his deep resounding, happily harmonious and woundily warbling dis-   5 course, he did at length, sucking in the air as doth one who eateth oysters, cough thrice, expectorate twice, and then strike his epi- gastrium once and again. This done, he did, gazing at the Lord Chief Justiciar, loll out his tongue as far as he was able, and bringing it again with a noisome chuck, thus begin: Salve! most potent, thrice illustrious and essentially valorous in disputation, discussion and decision, " presidium et dulce decus meuim!" Salve! doctor optime, doctor egregie, all hail! In very truth shall my pericardium eructate the germs of a pithy discourse, for I do perceive from the gnostic acuteness latent in the gumptious cellules of thy brain, thou wilt let no jot or tittle of this argument escape thee, but like Clion of Daulia, and Villain- ovanus the Thracian, Philochorus, Fulgentius and Camelopardus, high priests of St. Babingoose, have a care as well to that which is present and spoken " arguendo:' as to that which, being prete- rit and past, is cited and collated " summa diligentia" from tomes, libers, treatises, writings and excerpts; from which, to the great profit, benefit, advantage and behoof of my right worshipful clients, it will result, that the quirks in depositions, quips 'and ciacks in pleas, with divers aliter truth entangling diableries to be foisted on thy serenitics contemplation by the counsellors, ad- vocates, procurers and attorneys of the respondents here, shall be momentarily tried in the crucible of contemplation and flagrantly excoriated. Amen, amen, fiat fiatur! At this point, the Lord Chief Justice Owlet, moving uneasily in his chair, like he who hath a flea in his ear, did exclaim,-"Soft and fair, good Seargeant, what am I that thou art alone in thy dis- course mindful of me: sit I not here, with adjutors who are my soothers, and saluters? When next thou givest tongue to' thy thoughts, let it wag at them also." 4nan, anan, said Muddlehead- Gramercy, that will Hfor so be that " animi sapientia paucis datur,' yet I am stoutly in- clined to believe that an actual partition thereof may be had among your seignories, and each have a little. Resuming, then, the thread' of this discourse witl your good worship's indulgence, I presage and feel prognostically assured that upon the hearing of this matter, a judgment and decree, (as agreeable to the partisans of justice as is the fat of bacon to baked beans,) will be rendered and had. For al-    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6519-00000006"/> 6              ( though of a truth, so be that there are many fish of many kinds, many men of many minds, quot homines tot sententiae," yet, nevertheless, oh " omniforiam docti!' it would seem most strange to my discriminatory analysis of the harmonic unities of this plaint now spoken of to the merits, that mere gibble-gabblers, who only exist by larding their own thoughts with -the fat of other men's wits, should by crafty denials or subtle evasions, succeed in hugger-muggering, obfuscating or conflummuxing the transparent equities of the issue. Quare fremuerunt gentes? Know they not that in the mustard-pot of penance, shall be seasoned the sauce of their vanity? Hic et ubique will I stoutly traverse, gainsay, and reprehend all such gibberish mongers; though they cry like a cow, yet shall their wail no sooner percolate the auricular pene- tralia of your high mightinesses, than the voice of weeping, whilom heard in Rama, did unto those of Herod the tetrarch. Fiat Jus- titia, ruat caelum, Tas ,the great Golario hath it. I know, I trow full well, by what ;sarcasms, mockeries, bitter taunts, nipping -quips, biting quirks and damnable iterations, the cause of the prosecutors will be assailed; yet will not the champion of the re- spondents, although transforming himself, Proteus like, into a hundred various shapes and figures, have in me to deal with a sim- ple goose-cap, or phlegmatic Aesopus. But may the arch enemy gulp me! if I do not catcl him in the nick, an' he vex me, and devour him quick as Candaulcs, the Lydian King, did his wife. Favorisca mi, then while I excoriate, anatomize, delve, dive into, and ex- plore the profundity of this matter, analysing, examining and in- vestigating the same catagorically, oatachetically, longitudinally, and latitudinarily, by way of protestendo, premising with Confucius, that by searching after what is not, do we most nia- turally attain a knowledge of what is; to which same point let me say, are Rabbi Kimri, and Rabbi Ebenedwardus, and also Bartholus or Bardolph, the crier; Lampridius likewise tcstifieth thereto, as also Epectetus in his Asinaria. It is most intolerable and not to be endured, that though pen- dant like the sword of Damocles, the trenchant blade of justice hath never yet dismembered the hyperbolical fantasies of the respond- ents here. Perche, Perche in this cycle of judiciai gradcscence, should their fallacious coinminglings of crackarades and jugglingr- atoria be permitted to simmer in the kettle of jurisprudence, and ta   7 render slab and cold the porridge of judgment? Are not the prose- cutors men substantial, and of note? Yea, do they not own, and by seisin hold many houses and much land; entitled thus " ad omni jura et privilegia quae ad istum gradim pertinent and spe- cialiter to the care paternal of the respondents here; yet, by malefaction most perspicuous, no such is paid--True it is, and to their shame. May it please your serenities, a cry is raised of thrift, and'by way of pretence, observance of ordinances is by way of avoidance, pretended, yet " prout patet per recordum," not a supercurbing law is observed. But " in loco" the law "mu lier, the law grabum, the law " vilnum," the law " cepi ;" all which do manifestly excite and exasperate the evil contra quid this pro- cess or plaint is directed. It is patent that Gothamus, or Gotham, by common consent of all geographers, historians, lexicographers and politicians, is well entitled to many honorable eulogiums. Its inhabi- tants like clams in their shell when the water is high, " tes- tudines testa sua inclusi," exultingly can vaunt of the wealth that is among them. They have and do of a verity enjoy many blessings, "per essempio," conduits of sweet water aptly dispos- ed, prisons for offenders, opportune market-places for farina, horned beasts, and they of the finny tribe, yet per contra do they stand in need of another Hercules to purge their urban home of monstrous abuses, of " novae exactiones, nova onera imposita" under which they do yearly groan. Earth may become water, fire may give no heat, the leopard may change his spots, flannel drawers be made of tripe, Boston be not in Bengal, and even bul- locks feed in the bottom of the oceanus or ocean, yet will not the ap- petite of rapparees like the respondents alter; to them, as to me it seemeth, life doth consist but in the pursuit of lucre, auri sacra fames," consumeth their vitals, for in their microcosm the chief- est work per fas aut nefas" is continually in ambages, circuits, and flexuosities to circumvent the diligent.-Now, may I eat of the hearts of green frogs, and sip the milk of dragons! if the horned renegadoes, pollypragmonitic ardelions of whom we hear complaint, do longer, by their iniquities, defile the superficies or surface of the body politic! An' they do, may the blood of St. Jannarius cease to liquify!.-Confounded and utterly set at nought be the fubbing  pretences of these camomile heretics and blackberry knaves! I     *-        "  A..    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6519-00000007"/> 8 (At this point the Chief Justiciar, who had been for some time nidding and nodding, did give a great start, at which the Sergeant paused in surprise; evidently thereat disturbed.) Much more do I find in my heart to say in this dispute, but having I trow, exhausted the pertinency of the issue, not dogmatically nor syllogistically, sed simpliciter, I now appellate cheerfully to your deliberative functions, the which are impatiently abiding the time. Craving you, my Lord Chief Justice, and each of your worshipful co- adjutors then to adorn the tail of your understandings witht the feathers of argument and illustration, 1 have for your delectation gathered and culled from the wings of my imagination I do buono cuore," and with a "placebo," entreat you and each of you, well and truly to try, hear and determine this our difference, and true deliverance herein make, and that prestissimo, lest "Iis litem generans" we fall prey to the charges whereat we are here detained. Then arose Counsellor Tornado to make profert and advocate what to him might seem meet on the part .and behalf of the re- spondents in this matter, then and there, at difference. And first, by way of preface out of respect to the Court and them there assembled, did he turn to the east and to the west, and curve himself after the fashion of the Bengalese, thrice in either direc- tion; and then did genifluctuate himself profoundly, as do the Astrolabians, six several times to the south, where were placed the Chief Justiciar and his associates; and then rising with his tongue contracted, in his mouth he, did merrily warble it-at the same time placing his two medicinal fingers in his mouth against either jaw, he did clack them together very melodiously, chanting and chirping after the manner of swans and other fowl, so that all they present were greatly pleased and marvelled thereat; thinking that by these sounds he did mean to convey and give them to understand tlat he intended to pursue his argument soberly and peacefully, and not with a spirit of animosity or rancour against them op. posed to him, and thus he spake:   9 Hem! hem!  By your leave, good my lords dignataries, grave sirs and signiors, and placebit vobis? my masters all-(hem! hoick .t) Without farther exordium will I interlocute and inter- cise the substance and bulwark of this great matter; for verily it needeth no protocolation or preamble. When in the roar of wel- kins' reverberation, the elements spout out devastation, and fright- ful volcanoes in voluminous blast from cradled thunder-clouds ef- fuse sulphureous and pyrogenitous vapour!-while Jove's fierce lightning vivifyeth aether and scarifying the empyrean causeth the mighty Neptune eke to quaver and to quake, and makcth the cir- cumnavigous waters to simmer and to turgitate!-for "c x multitu- dine signorum colligitur." Viewing then the promovents in this matter now here coram vobis, and claiming their behests and our dire damnification at; your hands, may one exclaim, of a verity Pan- demonium is purged and all the multitudinous furies, imps and diabolitare here I Quod nota.-If what is just and meet be not administered to tlhese, my very approved, good and notable clients, then the groans of outraged equity rising to the firmament will repercuss to earth and make all wolves to howl and armadillos roar, and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears, while all the damned themselves will gape and univocally howl and ullulatc, and ih their hideous mirth will sear their eye-balls--im--in the burning gall of Phegethon's dunnest pyrignity!! Hereupon the counsellor gave three great groans--so great that all the assembly were startled thereat-and he did sweat sorely, at the same time quavering with his lips as monkeys use to do in the dismembering of a lobster. And thereupon the Chief Justi- ciar interlocuting did say unto him, "Hold my friend!-ho! my ' ", friend, soft and fair, speak at leisure and soberly, without put-" ting yourself in choler. I understand the case-go on." Yes, my lord submitto et refrigdesco. An' it please your lord- ships to pursue. And now then ideocunque considerans, and pa- tiently intending and animadverting thereunto will I (vobis reve- rendissimis placentibus), making mine voice to be heard, so discuss, digladiate, ratiocinate, advance, allege, extenuate and dilate this whole matter, *' ab abscisionem infiniti," both by aphorisms, pa- labras, precepts, adlocutions, arguments, authorities and conceits, both collective et distributive2-dum est facultas. And that too beyond all ambiguities, avoidance, maundering, abatement, re. 2    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6519-00000008"/> 10 mission, and peradventure of cavil or dispute; in manner that this whole matter shall be most manifest and apprehensive not only to all statesmen, scholars and erudite and perspective persons, but to the vulgar and commonalty. An' it be not so, may the red plague of the Tartar seize me! may the morphew wither me! and the sciatica resolve me into "materia prima '" Whilst whelps, toads, owls, imps, tenebrions, prodigious harpies and other night- birds, and all that spring from hag-seed, with black Hecate at their head, seething in flame and howling in their devilish rage, may verse their poisoned venom super me ct omnia bona et catella mea!! And now, if there 'be any who, unconscious of his own imbecility and utter foolishness and stultification, doth venture to hazard, as- severate or maintain that the worshipful signiors who are respon- dents here, have no claim of right or equity in the premises, and stand not recti, potential and well qualified in curia! then is he aut lapis aut bellua, and verily unworthy of consideration or cre- dence. Such an one hath a gourd for his head, a pepon for his heart, a gull, a dizzard, an illiterate idiot, a glow-worm, an arrant ass, a fungus, a Bedlam fool, vox inquissima et stultissima, a wiggle- waggle, a very goat, a fat brain, a slavering dotard, a C(aman ass, a thick-pated brute, a very Nebuchadnozor, a vertigenous lunatic a door-mouse, a mazy chuckle-head, a King Duffe, a muddle-pate, a purblind dolt, a rustling, wrangling, clutter-keeping swaggerer!!  And if any argument, position, opinion or affirmation, either acqui- site, adventitious, prognosticate, positive, inductive, suppositious, parabolic, categoric, hypothetic or problematic hath been or may or might be proferred or advanced here; and I cannot utterly, radically and totally, gainsay, subvert, overthrow, obliterate, and unsyllogise the same! then by the holy St. Inigo, am 1 naught and the son of naught, a shadow, a niddy-noddy, a periwinkle, a driveller, a shallow-babbler, a hodge-podge, a mouther, a bridle- champcr, a bag-pipe, a mcer drenching-horn, a mum-chance, a wind-blower, a ghibbcring tree-hopper, a whiner, a blockheadodus, a mumnping old hag! then may emrods, ear-wigs and the red flamingo entomophagotomise me! and I pray Beelzebub and his imps to receive me for torrefaction, for of a verity then is there no solacement or comfort for me here!! Again, my worshipful lords, for the better illustration and eluci-   " dation of this mine argument " ubi dolor ibi digitus" is a notable apothegm, as your serenities well know of Epicthonius Cosmopoli- tus (vir eruditus et doctrina clarus), and one not a whit the less apposite to these presents than to the occasions of his then occult elaborations and researches. For I hold that every particular atomus or corpusculum, not only in sublunary and terrestial, but in celestial and supermundane affairs, hath need and proper occa- sion for its own digitus or great prinmunm mobile to regulate, set in order, renew, renovate, ameliorate, refresh and support it in its weakness; dolour and decadence.  For, an' it do not, then "ubi peccatum ibi procella' as the learned Tris- megistus also well remarketh by . way  of corollary of the above, for of a verity, as sure as effect followeth cause, or sub- stance calleth for shadow, or progress is a sequence of commence- ment., or salt fish provoketh potation, or matter presupposes crea- tion, or creation predicates a will, or will prerogatives an actor, primum  mobile or propulsor, so surely doth the digitus follow the dolor, and palliateth or dissipatcth it, either by abrasion, in- cision, destriction, titillation, friction, detrition, amotion, conver- sion, subrogation, or collection; for " ubi jus ibi remedium.?' And therefore it is logically to be deduced therefrom, that the desederium pecunie being a dolor--there naturally followeth after it the digitus.-And so hath it been ever held and substantiated, not only by the opinions and, authority of all great wits and eru- dite men of all ages and times, both neoterick and ancient, of whom may I advance as exemplars de multis aliis-Suissetus, "the Calculator," in his treatise de mixtura potionum.-Hob- goblindus, the Magician, in his work on Phantasms and Rochester Rapus in his treatise "' de gullibus."--Foo-foo, the Tartarian, hath it in the JMalhabarata; so also, Mahado and Serpigo, the Bulga- rians; and Jimcrack, king of the Canarians.-Mamatretus also layeth down this principle, tome 2, page twenty-and-four, in his j treatise de Filibusteris and Humbuggardus. "O On the flim-flams and cobWebs of the law." Also Griddlemundus "de modo faciendi flapjacks." I may also cite the work of one Vagabundus, a Dane, entitled Spiritual spectacles to illuminate the muzzles of the ignorant." Also Arsoverserius de culbatatoriis, and Ros- cotojambus "de cosmographia Limbonis."  Also Aldermanus, de arte acquerendi, and O'Swindleman, the Hibernian, "' de usu    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6519-00000009"/> 12 et utilitate patatum." We have also Zim-Zim,' pupil of the great Confucius, in his 12th book, entitled Wish-Wash and Brandytoddodus in his essay " de carbunculis., (Ex Oriente lux.) Von Honder-,ponder, the High German, also is with us in his homily "Sassaginsen und Sauerkrowten."

And not only is this position and entire view of this matter consubstantiated, supported, and I may say solidified, by the testimony and authority of such potential and notable wits as  they have above cited and profertcd to this worshipful tribunal, but also in natura- rerum hath it ever existed as one of the' great findamental principles, decretals and axioms of that great primordial coda that regulateth and ordaineth this cosmical system and all they that dwell therein, both man and beast, both small and great, yea both big and little! Even from the period wlhn into the conturbated and heterogeneous cumulus of inorganic and hurly-burly chaos involuting in uncircumscribed and immeasurable vacuity, was infused and inspirated the great animus mundi, (O! festumn diem!) and homo (qui ex thumo) was procreated, and endowed with great sapience, understanding, and all excellencics and felicities, till diverted therefrom by thetcun- ning devices and subtile conceits of old Sathanus (the dragon)- Ehle! Ellilu! pro dolor!-Yea, from the time when Moloch and his devilish crew Ashtaroth, Behemoth, Ostrapoth, Blastthemoth, Gotacough, and Tumbleoff, being mightily puffed up and madly exalted, were utterly subverted, prosternated, demolished, and made to dwell in Tophet, hard by the black Cocytus, even so was it, and so mought it be, both nune and tunc, tarabin and tarabas I -so say ego-ct t2u autern? Ha! my masters? An' it be'not, give me the estrapado .! May I be powdered with pestles! pulve- rized b) grindstones! scarified by June bugs cauterised with brimstone! peppered with mustard seed! cicatriced by gadflys! 1   183 excoriated by Spanish plasters! broken on wheelbarrows! baked in a volcano! tossed by unicorns! worried by office seek- ers! scalped by aborigines! stoned by small boys! pecked by mudarlks! riddled by porcupines, and smashed by battering rams!-rasped on graters! phlebotomised by bloodsuckers! engulphed by maelstrodms! swallowed by leviathans and anthro- pophagised by cannibals!!-May I be drawn, quartered, haved, divided, subtracted, demolished, dismembered, and in toto anni- hilated! May-I .be like an owl in the wilderness! a cat in a duck pond! an erimite in the desert! a pelican in-- "Hold! hold, I pray you, good counsellor,l hereupon interlocuted the Chief Justi- ciar. "I think we comprehend you fully in this matter, and albeit  ; it would be matter of delectation to hear you further herein, I  "think you may now make an ending of your discourse, for we " "have already consumed much time-so make an ending I pray , you. Hereupon, the counsellor on being thus interlocuted by the Chief Justiciar, did assume a very dolorous visage, at the same time ghibbering anti shivering' with his chaps as apes use to do when in choler-for he was mightily aggrieved-but albeit, think- ing better of the matter, he thus spake by way of ending:- Well, then, I submit myself to your worshipful lordship's good pleasure and volitions herein, and will pursue mine argument no fur- ther, though I might say much more and to the point, but in good sooth, I think that I have spoken plainly of the letter and history of the factum, and made myself sufficiently clear and perspective in properly placing the case before you, and of a verity, it lieth all as it were in a cocoa nut, as plain, an' it please your lordships, as flies in a milkpot. And therefore, my lords, I do most humbly require that, by your lordships, there may be, without further re- moras or hindrance, said and declared upon the case what is rea- sonable, with costs, damages and interests, for we are here at great charge. And then a day was given to the parties aforesaid, to hear in open view of all the people, the definitive sentence and judgment of the said the Lords Justiciarn    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6519-00000010"/> " At which time and place came the parties aforesaid, with their friends, retainers, solicitors, counsellors and advocates. And the constabularii and tip-staffs, having administered the estrapado to such of the commonalty as had intruded too tumultuously with- in the precincts and sacred enclosures of the said court of Jus- tice. The said Lord Chief Justiciai Owlet, accompanied by the mem- bers of the Worshipful Judicatory, did, thereupon, rising up, say unto his compeers, coadjutors and assessors, as follows:- "Well! my masters, ye have heard read and spoken the ac- " cusations, mandates, delegations, replies, tri-plies, grievances," denunciations, declinatories, anticipatores, arguments, and"  "other such-like conceits and spiceries, both of the one and the " other side in this dissension and debate.-What think ye," then, of the various and seeming contraries in law, that are  'laid claim to and advanced by the suitors and pleading parties?" And they made answer unto him-  We have in truth heard"' them, andhave well sententiated and pondered thereupon, but  "have not so much as understood one iota, scintilla or corpus- ' "culum of this whole matter. Therefore, then, we do beseech ' you "una voce" to lighten our labor in this behalf, and such ' "judgment to give therein as to you seemeth meet." ' Well, my masters," responded he,--"As I do not truly find " "  the case so difficult, I will obey your behest, and will no longer  "delay, defer, prorogate or shift off the definitive sentence in  "this process. And I do well hope that all will be content and" "notincensed, irritated and exasperated to a higher point of" discord and polemicity than ever they were at before." And thereupon the said Chief Justiciar did doff his cap, and salute the company with such majestic grace as became a person of his paramount degree and eminency, ahid walk a turn or two, groaning profoundly-and did sigh exceeding heavily-at the same time blowing like a goose with the intensity of his ratiocination, and then having returned, he sat down and did lift up his eyes heavenward, and then turned them into his head again, like a she- goat, when ill at ease, and at length began to pronounce sentence clearly and stentoriphonically. Having well considered and patiently digested the law Gallus,   15 6 the law quinquepedem, the law vinumn, the law mulier bona, and the law nulla bona, the law si quis, and the law quid-quid, and the law chaw-quid, the law auromercuriale, the law digitalis, the law of seizen, and the law of reason, the law meum and the law tuum. And lastly, having well and truly analyzed and considered the bearing of the Codus or Code herein-at which last, of a truth my brains were metragobolised and confounded. I do hold by an abnegation of both extremes-with Father Hippothadeus and Doctor Rumbellicus, that as to so much of the plaint as chargeth the respondents with attempting to usurp the functions of the C( primun mobile," or exasperate the influences of the dolor in its vacellations and variations in its peculiar orbit; that the same is unproven and cacodoxical; and that the respondents may go thereof without day. But that such part of the case as pointeth, or hath reference to the respondents' neglect of the laws meum and tuunm, and their proclivity to the law asinaria, and such part as treateth of the capacites of bellua cornuta to wax oleaginous or mucillagenous upon sea-weed in the mare clausurn and not the mare turgido or turbato, is severally substantiated and well taken and found. Testing also the truth of this matter by Hydromancy, Le- chinamancy reputed of old among the Assyrians, and Feminofancy held of such account by the Emperor Heliogobalus, and by the scratching of my own left auricular, and the pricking or titillation of my two thumbs or polices as Jehorax, King of Mesopotamia, was wont to do, dum venerit judicare.-I do fatidically conclude. That (Egiptianus, although philospohically nihil, yet is legally su- perior and morally less putrescent than OSwindleman, the Hi- bernian-and his opinion in this matter entitled to more consid- eration and weight; I do further hold, that the promovents were justified in the proposition by them adduced and advocated, that by the disuse of spectacles, the ocular propensities of the testudo or lobster, were substantially impaired, and that the maxim of Confucius " ubi jus ibi remedium" in such case, is pertinent and applicable, for non constat, saith Foster in his treatise on flea-bites -but that Crustacea may require such adventitious translucency or artificial paraphanoptic application as doth the homo qui ex- humo producitur. Which said decision and opinion having been pronounced, there ,    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6519-00000011"/> 16 arose from the midst of all them there present, as well as of the law as of the laity, a great murmur of approbation and assent, such as had never before came to pass-in any court or tribunal -so were they ravished and delected by this so admirabled and pellucid decision and disposal of this so long protracted matter. And the altercation and heat of the promovents and respondents beingmuch abated,-declining from their former strife, they did instantly come to a firm accommodation of their differences, while all the multitude retiring from the presence--gat them to their homes marvelling at the wisdom of the great Justiciar, and with one consent confessing that there was no exercise, sport, game, play or recreation in all this palatine, palatial or parliamentary world, more aromatising and fragrant than a suit or. process well vanned and winnowed, tossed and canvassed, precisely, narrowly and neatly garbled, sifted, searched and examined, and on all hands exactly argued, disputed, debated and decided.  </p>
