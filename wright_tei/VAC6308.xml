            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I AM aware that I have violated the unities of time and place in this history of
               LUCIA DARE, but in the sketch of a whole life that error could not be avoided. I have
               touched as lightly as I could upon the war—I hope without bitterness. The people of
               Natchez know whether I have exaggerated such incidents as are located there. I trust
               myself fearlessly to their experience. They will, perhaps, complain that I have dared
               to transcend the privilege of fiction, and have written so plainly that persons and
               places may be too decisively pointed out under my assumed characters. I can only say,
               I have tried to write as delicately as I could, and to veil even the embryos of my
               incidents. In regard to the life of Jane Noland—subordinately used here—a word more
               is necessary. <emph>My</emph> characters are drawn from real personages. Lieutenant
               Philip Noland, of the U. S. Navy, did marry, in 18—, the beautiful Jane L——, of
               Natchez, in opposition to the will of her family. He was ordered to sea shortly
               after, and he never returned. His lovely wife died of a broken heart, calling to the
               last upon her absent husband. What became of Philip Noland? None knows to this day;
               nothing was ever heard of him. His miniature, his letters to his wife, her obituary,
               alone remain to tell that these two ever lived. These articles I can command at any
               moment to verify <emph>my</emph> statement that a portion of MY STORY is not fiction.
               I never saw Mr. Hale's story of "The Man without a Country"—which appeared in
               "Harpers' Monthly" in 1853—until three months after I had written <emph>mine.</emph>
               Mr. Hale's story was then given me, by the niece of Jane and Philip Noland. I read
               it. I resolved to leave mine as it was written, my facts having been furnished from
               family archives.</p>
            <p>Philip and Jane Noland were <emph>real</emph> persons of Natchez. I have combined
               with their sad history two other veritable ones. I know there are persons living who
               will recognize and disentangle the threads which I have wound together in the story
               of the apparition of Lucia Vail, in the saving of the little Vadine, even to the
               repetition of the Lord's Prayer by the child shipwrecked in the Gulf. The events of
               the refugee life of Louise Peyrault were all suggested by fact. For the unusual
               degree of learning attributed to Annie Laurie, I crave indulgence. I know women as
               learned as she—few as lovely in character as her prototype. For this was an effort at
               a life-portrait. Like most imitators of Nature, I have made probably but a bungling
               attempt at a likeness of God's most perfect handiwork—a true and perfect woman.</p>
            <p>I write principally what I see and what I know. I may idealize, but I have little
               talent for invention. Such people as I have known, I try to paint!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DEPARTURE.</head>
                  <p>SUCH a dreary day! The wind whistled shrilly around the street corners,
                     bringing with it showers of snow, and sleet, and rain, out of GOD'S
                     treasury.</p>
                  <p>The sky was gloomy, gray, and overcast. People plodded about with wavering
                     umbrellas, their feet shod with clogs or waterproof boots. Hacks and hansoms
                     and cabs were plying a brisk trade, dashing up and down the streets with
                     tightly-closed window-glasses and fast-drawn curtains. The coachmen muffled up
                     to their ears in Indian rubber overalls and caps pulled firmly down over their
                     eyes, swearing at their smoking horses, as they drove vehemently—splashing
                     through the mud. It was a day to make any body swear who indulged in that
                     profane luxury. A raw, gusty, wet, cold, altogether as hateful an exhibition of
                     weather, as the climate of England could succeed in getting up in October.</p>
                  <p>The ships lay off in the harbor with their sails closely furled, plunging at
                     their heavy anchors, and rolling in a style not generally appreciated by
                     landsmen.</p>
                  <p>But nearer into the shore, at the piers, there rocked, on the short yeasty
                     waves, several steamers with fires lighted and steam up—long, low, black,
                     three-decked ships, their short iron pipes belching forth white puffs of
                     condensed vapor, that hung, collected in a mass, like a broad canopy over these
                     vessels. The atmosphere was too heavy for the steam to ascend. Plenty of life
                     and activity about these steamers—drays, carts, express wagons, and men;
                     porters hurrying to and fro, carrying trunks and parcels, valises and
                     portmanteaux, and custom officers, all mingled together, crowded, pushing,
                     passing and repassing, in any but amiable moods of temper. Especially great the
                     activity seemed near the largest of these vessels;—her flags were all out,
                     hanging loosely drenched by the rain; she was the "America," bound direct for
                     New Orleans; to sail this very evening at five P. M.</p>
                  <p>Many of her passengers were already aboard the vessel; but others lingered with
                     their friends, waiting with the hearts that loved them, till the very last
                     moment, before they said that ever sad,—in this changeful life of
                     ours,—ever-recurring word, "Good-bye."</p>
                  <p>In a parlor, at the Adelphi hotel, sat two of these latter persons.</p>
                  <p>They had turned away from the table, on which stood the untasted dessert of
                     fruits and wines, and were sitting close together, near the fire, talking in
                     earnest, in subdued tones, the manner of both exhibiting much repressed
                     emotion.</p>
                  <p>One of these persons, a man, his hair white with age, his kindly blue eyes
                     swimming with unshed tears, his voice tremulous with feeling, spoke almost
                     bitterly—pleading, as if for his own life.</p>
                  <p>"Lucia, at this, the eleventh hour, I implore you to give up this wild
                     expedition! Let me send for your luggage; return with me to Hurst! to the home
                     of your ancestors, to the people who know you and love you! My child! my child!
                     this is a silly, unpractical, romantic, wayward thought of yours! A tender,
                     delicate, high-bred woman, young and attractive as you—to go to America to
                     search for such a reckless lad as Gerald! gone so long too! so many years!
                     fully six years! and not one word—not a line, to give the faintest clue where
                     to begin to look for him! My dearest child! my precious girl! give it<pb
                        n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6308-00000005"/> up! give it up! go back with me to the
                     Hurst!"</p>
                  <p>The old man took both hands of the girl in his, and pressed them to his lips,
                     while the tear-drops streamed fast down his withered cheeks.</p>
                  <p>Lucia Dare breathed quickly a hurried sigh—almost sobbed, shaken to her heart's
                     centre, by the sorrow and anxiety of her friend. Alas! her <emph>only</emph>
                     friend—the sole heart, warmed by drops of kindred blood, in all England that
                     loved her.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Cousin Vail! don't speak so at this last hour! You only distress me with
                     your forebodings! I <emph>must</emph> go—I <emph>must, must</emph> find my
                     Gerald! My brother! My poor, outcast, injured, wandering boy! Come kiss me now,
                     quick—say good-bye—I must get aboard the steamer, before it grows darker! it is
                     such a gloomy, gloomy day!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia shuddered as she glanced out of the window; the fog was thickening, and
                     the waves looked black and angry, dashing white caps, with fierce, sullen rage,
                     chafing the sides of the tossing, rocking vessels in port, outside the
                     docks.</p>
                  <p>"It <emph>is</emph> a dreary day to start out! I could have wished to have seen
                     the last of dear old England under a pleasanter sky than this! But it is only
                     for a while, dear Cousin Vail; I shall soon be back—soon. America is not
                     illimitable in extent! There are railroads and steamboats to facilitate one's
                     travel! Why, I can run over all of it in less than a year! Think, I may return
                     next autumn! I may soon find Gerald; at any moment I may alight upon him, and
                     bring back the young lord in triumph to his people! Oh! what joy, what joy for
                     me—for you—for us all!</p>
                  <p>"We have discovered the ship he sailed in. We know his nom de voyage! Such a
                     romantic name—'Edward Montague'—fit for the hero of a novel! But Gerald was
                     always so full of romance; his mind so stuffed with tales of chivalry and
                     border ballads—my rash, inconsiderate, gallant, high-minded boy! Let me go,
                     Cousin Vail! let me go!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail dropped her hands with a gesture of hopelessness. Lucia lifted her
                     hand, now freed from the old man's clasp, to her eyes, pressing the white lids
                     firmly for an instant, till the sweet orbs were clear from rebellious moisture;
                     then walking to the mirror, she took her bonnet from the table beside it, and
                     tied it on her head. Her fingers trembled, but she drew the strings firmly, and
                     pulled out the ribands under her rounded chin, with the dainty care of a neat
                     woman, whose self-respect requires even the bow of her bonnet to be properly
                     and becomingly adjusted. She proceeded to invest herself rapidly with the warm,
                     costly wrappings lying near; the seal-skin cloak the rich sables, the fine
                     under-shawl of rarest cashmere, all giving silent evidence that riches, at
                     least, were not lacking to her, though her griefs and cares seemed serious
                     indeed. The old man watched her in silence, sighing heavily as the last button
                     was made fast, and Lucia stood before him equipped for departure, still holding
                     in her small hands the gloves, lined with softest fur, waiting to receive the
                     farewell pressure of his aged arms.</p>
                  <p>The old man took her in his arms and pressed her to his bosom.</p>
                  <p>"My dearest, darling child, daughter of my heart! the Lord bless thee, and keep
                     thee, the Lord cause his face to shine on thee, the Lord protect thee in all
                     thy wanderings, the Lord grant thee the desire of thy heart, and lead thee back
                     soon in joy and peace to thine own home, thine own people; and grant that I may
                     live to welcome thee, and thy poor long lost brother, once more under the
                     ancestral roof-tree.—Farewell! my Lucia! My noble, brave child! farewell!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia clung speechlessly to the bosom of her old friend, her second father,
                     whose face she might never look upon again. She recalled in a rushing,
                     concentrated flood of memories, all he had been to her, since her earliest days
                     of orphanhood—always—always—her true, tender friend, her faithful, patient
                     counsellor; so good, so considerate, so kind—truly he had loved her as his own
                     child, and now she was acting in opposition to his advice—counter to his
                     judgment! wounding his affections—leaving him in his old age, perhaps to die
                     alone with kind people, it was true, about him, and loving, if humble hands, to
                     tender him the last offices of human affection; but not <emph>her</emph> hands,
                     whose ministering she knew was dearest to his aged heart; not her love, which
                     was the only human affection he yet clung to on this side of eternity.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Cousin Vail! dear Cousin Vail! think of me kindly, patiently! Indeed,
                     indeed I love you. I love my home! I love, oh, I love England; but I must, I
                        <emph>must</emph> find my mother's child! I must seek Gerald over the
                     world—over the world!"</p>
                  <p>Kiss after kiss she pressed vehemently upon the aged, trembling lips and
                     wrinkled checks; then gently unclasping his clinging arms, she drew her veil
                     over her face, snatched up her small traveling-bag, and timidly quitted the
                     room, carefully closing the door behind her.</p>
                  <p>Walking swiftly to the door opposite, she knocked—it was instantaneously
                     opened. "Come," she said.</p>
                  <p>A maid, already invested in traveling costume, brought forward the dressing-box
                     of her lady. A man-servant followed, swinging the umbrellas and railroad
                     blankets by a leathern strap in his hand. The bowing waiter respectfully opened
                     the door, Lucia stepped hastily into the carriage in waiting, her attendants
                     followed in another. Lucia gave the order "To the America," and sunk back on
                     the carriage cushions, weeping silently. Once, just before the carriage turned
                     the street corner, after which the view of the Adelphi would be lost, she
                     leaned forward, and looked back; she saw through her misty vision, a window
                     opened, a venerable head protruded, the gray locks floating in the wind, sleet
                     and rain falling unnoticed upon his bald crown, as old Mr. Vail leant out
                     anxiously to catch the very last glimpse of the carriage which was taking away
                     the darling of his aged heart. Lucia waved her handkerchief—the parting signal
                     was quickly returned—the carriage whirled round the corner. In a few moments
                     the smoking thoroughbreds were drawn up at the head of the pier. The Captain of
                     the America, evidently on the watch, came to the side of the carriage.</p>
                  <p>"My lady, I have been expecting you every moment. It is nearly the last hour,
                     and we are ready to cast off and go down the channel with the tide."</p>
                  <p>Lucia gave him her hand without reply. He aided her to the deck of the
                     vessel—to the door of her state-room. "If you need anything more, Lady Dare, I
                     am ready to offer any thing on the vessel for your service."</p>
                  <p>The polite captain bowed and retired. Lucia allowed herself to be
                     disembarrassed of her bonnet and wrappings by her maid. Then signing to her
                     servants that she desired to be left alone, she bolted her state-room door, and
                     throwing herself down on her berth, gave vent to her emotions in a hysterical
                     fit of weeping.</p>
                  <p>Lucia Dare was a very earnest, strong-hearted woman—strong-hearted, not at all
                     strong-minded.</p>
                  <p>In spite of Plato, and John Stuart Mill, and Miss Anna Dickinson, mankind
                     generally prefer the strong-hearted women to their abler, iron-nerved, powerful
                     muscled sisters, who never do go into hysterics, have a contempt for nerves,
                     weaknesses and softnesses of all kinds, especially for fragile, delicate,
                     dainty, dimpled, dreamy, brown-eyed women, like Lucia Dare, who can only be
                     stirred up to heroism by impulses of wronged, outraged, or robbed affections;
                     who always wear long trailing skirts, pretty and useless shawls and scarfs that
                        <emph>will</emph> assume the form of folds of drapery, that
                        <emph>will</emph> adorn as well as cover them; whose hair billows in glossy
                     waves all over their little classic heads; whose red under-lips have a trick of
                     quivering like a babe's mouth, when any thing troubles them, or "<emph>their
                        feelings are hurt.</emph>" No. Lucia Dare was just now in a state, which
                     proved her to be utterly unworthy of the grander specimens of her sex, who give
                     lectures on women's rights, universal suffrage, political economy, and threaten
                     to abolish all feminine vanities, in the way of gear, to wear trowsers in lieu
                     of robes, to lay aside all "wimples, and veils, and trains, and ring and nose
                     jewels, and ear-rings, and head-tirings, and anklets," and every other ornament
                     that has charmed female eyes, and ensnared men's hearts, from the days of Moses
                     and Solomon, to the present vanities of chignons and Nina jackets. Poor little
                     tender Lucia! but there is nothing useless in God's universe. Delicate
                     butterflies there are as well as honey bees; tender organisms, and light and
                     grace, beauty and color lavished with unsparing hand by the Master of life all
                     over creation that we don't see "<emph>the use of.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>While Lucia weeps herself into a state of exhaustion and sleep, and the vessel
                     runs down St. George's Channel, this long, dark night, we will narrate what
                     brought her to this pass, and show why this timid woman felt compelled to start

                  <p>AWAY down in the south-west of England, in the shire of Cornwall, between the
                     mountains and the sea, stands the village of Hurst. It is not a large place,
                     boasting only some two thousand inhabitants; the houses, for the most part,
                     built in an irregular style, both of architecture and location, were set about
                     as it suited the convenience of the denizens or the interest of the landowner,
                     the great man of this district, who had been known, from time immemorial, to
                     the people of this county, as the Baron of Hurst. There had been Barons of
                     Hurst long before the Saxon Heptarchy. As for the Norman families and their
                     genealogical trees, these Barons of Hurst spoke of <emph>them</emph> always
                     with the slightest possible consideration "as new people." Eight hundred or
                     more years were regarded by these primeval noblemen as rather
                        <emph>mushroomy;</emph> men that fought with William the Conqueror were men
                     of yesterday! What were Percies, and Howards, and Beauchamps<pb n="10-11"

                     descended, on the maternal side, from the ancient mythical kings of
                     Britain—whose ancestors all spoke purest Cymrie, who had Celtic bards to play
                     before them on harps, regularly unpedalled, triangular, gold-glittering,
                     classic harps, and sing the deeds and valor of the Dares, in the earliest age
                     of the Druids!</p>
                  <p>Didn't they have in their traditional archives the remains of a poem in all the
                     twenty-six metres, besides the Latin, that every Welsh bard was obliged to be
                     familiar with before he could put on the blue-bordered white robe, and graduate
                     in his profession, glorifying their ancestor, Cerdic ap Gyrieth, ap Morgan ap
                     Steyn, and so on for an indefinite number of aps, on account of said Cerdic's
                     victory over Fingal, the hero of the Scottish gaels?</p>
                  <p>Didn't one of the family in the year 1300 A. D. write an elaborate treatise in
                     Greek, with copious marginal notes in Latin, blackest kind of black letter,
                     with terrific abbreviations, much worse than those of the Code Populorum,
                     proving that "Dare" was <emph>not</emph> derived from the intermarriage with a
                     Norman of that name, but that it could be traced very clearly back to Phœnician
                     times, or previous to the era when the Jewish captives were sent over by the
                     Egyptians to work those long-forgotten but now recently re-discovered tin mines
                     of Corn-wall? How easy it was to trace Dare back through modern Anglican
                     corruption to the Greek <foreign xml:lang="GRC">Δερις</foreign>, battle or war,
                     or <foreign xml:lang="GRC">Δερος</foreign>, durable, long-lived, lasting—or
                        <foreign xml:lang="GRC">Δαρειος</foreign>, the royal Darius, or even
                        <foreign>Δαρατος</foreign>, bread, seeing the Dares had always been given to
                     strife, were great warriors, <unclear>had</unclear> been, and were still, a
                     sort of perennial family, were notoriously almsgiving, even in Saxon times, the
                     Cymnic "Giver of Bracelets" turning, through the influence of St. Columba, into
                     a Christian "Giver of Bread," and might have been intermixed, for what anybody
                     knew to the contrary, with some of the captive children of the famous Persian
                     monarch!</p>
                  <p>An ancestor of theirs had been educated at the Court of Domitian with
                     Constantine, had fought under the Labarum, and been baptized at the same time
                     with the first Christian Emperor in the porphyry font still on exhibition at
                     the Church of St. John Lateran in the Eternal City! The Dares valued themselves
                     highly!</p>
                  <p>Of all the Dares that ever filled the seignorial chair of Hurst there never had
                     been one so proud, so haughty, and so arbitrary as the present occupant, Sir
                     Hugh. He ruled over his extensive manorial lands with absolute despotism. Any
                     resistance to his imperial ukases, roused in his mind not only inexpressible
                     surprise, supreme contempt, but also unmitigatible rage and intemperance, both
                     in word and action. Woe betided the unlucky wight who crossed or thwarted one
                     of Sir Hugh's whims! He would crush an opponent under his lordly heel, like a
                     viper, if he could—and he always did, <emph>where</emph> he could. Fate had
                     stripped him, one by one, of all those unfortunates, who, by the accident of
                     birth, were nearest his person and most in his power. His wife (she was a
                     Courtenay, the blood of Godfrey of Bouillon, and the gentle Queen of Jerusalem,
                     Sybilla, flowed in her veins, and <unclear>was</unclear> exhibited in her
                     lovely character, still something of oriental softness, Syrisu warmth, and
                     languor), soon perished in his iron grasp. Sir Hugh <emph>did</emph> feel a
                     momentary weakness come over him as he gazed for the last time on the pure face
                     of his dead wife, and recalled her sweet, womanly ways, her timid, earnest,
                     deprecating looks at him in his rages, the deep, unfathomable tenderness which
                     at times filled those eyes, closed now so calmly, under the long, silken lashes
                     ["Were ever lashes so long and so dark?" he thought] especially when the mother
                     gazed upon her living, infant children.</p>
                  <p>"What a mother it was!" he muttered. "How she loved those children!" and she
                     had <emph>tried</emph> to love him. He <emph>knew</emph> she had tried! Why did
                     the woman die? She suited him; she was obedient and convenient!" With a feeling
                     almost of anger at her, and hatred to the unjust Providence who thus interfered
                     with his comfort, he drew the satin shroud hastily over the pale dead face, and
                     quitted the room with indignant steps, even while his eye-lashes were yet
                     moist!</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh had married late in life: his hair was white when he buried Lady
                     Sybilla. He never sought to replace her, perhaps he thought he couldn't easily
                     do that. He had her suite of apartments shut up, just as they were; locked the
                     keys in an unused cabinet—they rusted there in forgotten, or purposely
                     neglected quiet. He never took them in his hand again.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh seemed harsher and sterner than ever after Lady Dare's death; none of
                     those about him, however, suffered so much from his fierce, ungovernable temper
                     as his children. Of these, his wife had left but two living—a girl of three,
                     and a boy of eighteen months old—Lucia and Gerald.</p>
                  <p>Lucia resembled her mother in most of her characteristics; but there was
                     something of the Dare temperament too that flashed out occasionally, as she
                     developed, giving evidence of greater strength, energy and temper than the
                     yielding Sybilla Courtenay had ever exhibited.</p>
                  <p>As for Gerald, he was a Dare, only slightly tempered by the admixture of the
                     mother's gentle nature, and gradually modified in his fire and pride of heart,
                     by the education of Love he received from his devoted sister, who passionately
                     adored him, and whose continual self-sacrifice for his gratification, struck
                     recurringly every hour upon the generosity of his, impulsive. If haughty,
                     willful soul, and made Gerald <emph>almost</emph> patient, and
                        <emph>wholly</emph> loving towards Lucia. Towards his father, Gerald's
                     feelings were rather mixed. He admired his father extravagantly; he sympathized
                     heartily in all the antediluvian vanity and pride of the Dares, generally, and
                     of Sir Hugh in particular. He used often, when very young, to hide himself in
                     some secure corner, and watch his father ride or walk off. The stately,
                     arrogant, white-haired man, with his fiery, dark eyes, who completely filled
                     Gerald's ideal of the kings, the splendid royal personages, fathers of the
                     princes and transformed princesses in the fairy tales Gerald was never weary of
                     listening to from Lucia's lips, as she read or talked him to sleep every
                     night—so long as Gerald was small enough, at this hour, he was clasped to her
                     baby bosom, as she sat on the floor. Then when he grew too big for that, Lucia
                     sat by him on a sofa, with his head on her lap—such a wise, loving little
                     mother—sister—she was!</p>
                  <p>But when Gerald felt the tightening of the reins of authority in his father's
                     master-hand; when for some childish mischief or youthful inadvertence, he had
                     to endure the fiery-flashing of those fierce eyes, and the overwhelming
                     vituperation of that bitter, disdainful tongue. Gerald hated his father! Even
                     in his earliest childhood, when he would be arraigned like a culprit before his
                     father's chair in the magisterial office, where the judgments were sudden,
                     surprising and unchangeable as those of the Council of Three; he would draw
                     himself up defiantly throw back his beautiful, bold child's head, and flash
                     back glance for glance of scorn and furious rage; though his baby-lips were
                     silent, his eyes spoke volumes of rebellious anger! Poor Lucia would stand off,
                     always following Gerald to the place of judgment, her hands clasped tightly in
                     fear, her whole form instinct with love, and entreaty to Gerald "to be good, to
                     be quiet, and not to answer papa."</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh liked his audacious, spirited, handsome son better for the traits, he
                     could not avoid recognizing in the child, so like his own.</p>
                  <p>"Gerald is a Dare—a true Dare"—he would say sometimes, when in an unusually
                     gracious mood, to such of his acquaintances as ventured upon the liberty of
                     discussing with him his children, his dogs, his horses, or anything that
                     belonged to him. "Lucia was nothing particular; shy and obedient, the best
                     character for a woman; she looked like her mother, a Courtenay!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia's eyes, though, sometimes made the blood surge to his proud cold heart,
                     with a vim that nearly made him exclaim aloud impatiently, angrily—they were so
                     like Sybilla's—large, loving, dreamy, brown eyes, like the gazelle's on the
                     mountains of Lebanon. He felt uneasy under those eyes. Lucia was at times
                        <emph>very</emph> distasteful to him. He had been so cold, so stern, so hard
                     to Sybilla! Yet, in his way, he loved her. Yes! he did love her—he loved her
                     now! he yearned after her. He would have laid down, willingly, his dreary, icy
                     life to have looked once more into those wistful, unregarded eyes, that had
                     gone so sorrowfully all through her lonely, isolated, though exalted life,
                     craving love, longing for sympathy, closing so wearily at last, to find rest
                     and peace with God. Oh! "What a barren, aretic iceberg life was—even for a
                     Dare!"</p>
                  <p>Such thoughts did not come often, but they came; and Sir Hugh avoided his
                     little daughter, when he could. Sir Hugh had not a real friend in the world;
                     not one—unless it was Arthur Vail, his dead Sybilla's favorite cousin, who
                     seemed to have inherited something of Sybilla's love for this hard, cast-iron
                     man.</p>
                  <p>Arthur Vail, of the same age as himself, was the nearest approach to a
                     companion Sir Hugh had upon this earth. Mr. Vail was a mild, affectionate,
                     gentle-natured man, who had loved Sybilla Courtenay so much, that he never
                     thought of <emph>being "in love</emph>" with any other woman. He might have
                     succeeded very well in the world; his talents were good, his education fine,
                     his appearance pleasing, while the rent-roll of Vail-court was by no means
                     despicable; but he had been content to linger near Sybilla, without even asking
                     himself why. Sybilla had never suspected his devotion to her to be beyond
                     cousinly regard; she was accustomed to his presence, and very fond of him. She
                     had been married to Sir Hugh without consultation or consideration for her
                     wishes, when she was scarcely more than a child in years, and still immature in
                     character. Like a good woman, her instincts all turned to her husband, if he
                     would only have permitted her to <emph>be</emph> devoted to him. But he had
                     chilled her to death, as any other poor little butterfly would have been
                     clasped to a block of ice.</p>
                  <p>What can the delicate, gauzy, gold-spotted wings of any butterfly, human or
                     otherwise do, but fade and perish struggling in the mid-winter of life with
                     winds, and sleet, and snow? They ought to die with the summer's roses. So
                     Sybilla died in her summer of beauty, if not of joy! Somehow Arthur Vail had
                     gradually acquired strong influence over Sybilla's husband.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh was conscious of his disinterested affection, and was really grateful
                     for it, far down in the depths of his haughty heart. He liked to have Mr. Vail
                     at the Hurst; so Mr. Vail came often and staid long. He was never in Sir Hugh's
                     way—never troublesome or inconvenient. There<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000007"/> was a fine and rare collection of manuscripts
                     and folios in the grand old library, in one of the vast apartments at the
                     Hurst, into which Sir Hugh seldom entered. Mr. Vail loved books. He spent most
                     of his days there. Sir Hugh was so much occupied in the management of his
                     estates (he prided himself on being a <emph>practical</emph> farmer), and in
                     the adjustment of the affairs of the county, and of the British Empire
                     generally, that all his hours that were spent indoors were passed in his own
                     office, a smaller room in another wing of the huge antique segregation of
                     architecture of all sorts, periods and styles, that conglomorated in the
                     building called The Hurst. Here he overlooked the books of his steward and
                     agents, read the newspapers, kept the votes of his freeholders and tenants in
                     order, examining into the detail and minutiæ of every thing going on about him.
                     Stormy scenes there were often enough in this apartment; but the mutterings of
                     the tempest never reached Mr. Vail's ears, through the thicknesses of vast
                     walls. He dreamed on through life, in the quiet peace and serenity of the
                     library, like a pre-Raphaelite saint, floating in the higher stratum of
                     atmosphere, with only pure, horizontal cumuli in the blue heaven about him—the
                     region of the Graiæ all beneath his feet.</p>
                  <p>The Hurst was a quaint old pile. It would have delighted a Ruskinite in some
                     portions and set him wild with indignation in others. There were low
                     "cyclopean" wings, with round, stumpy towers heaped up, stone upon stone,
                     without mortar, such as the Scots and Picts built, apparently in imitation of
                     natural caves, or dens, queer dark rooms with little odd loopholes for windows,
                     some had floors, built on arches of stone, cemented up to the third stories,
                     and there were steep, narrow, dim winding stairways, that made one dizzy to
                     climb, and brought on a sympathetic attack of aching, in modern knees, even to
                     look at; and yet these were all worn into hollows on the steps, from the
                     multitude of feet that had walked; or sprang, or danced, or tottered up and
                     down them, for so many, many ages. One part, a Norman addition, tradition said,
                     had been frequently the temporary abode of Royalty. Taillefer had sung there,
                     before William the Conqueror; and Queen Elizabeth had slept there, and opened
                     the vast ball-room with her own regal feet, in a stately minuet with Leicester.
                     The Queen's suite of rooms were rather appalling to nineteenth century eyes,
                     and every person with modern bowels of humanity sincerely pitied the "fair
                     Virgin throned by the West," for being compelled to live in such horrid, dismal
                     dungeons as those rooms were. But perhaps when the tapestry was new and bright,
                     that room that now hung in faded, tattered rags upon the damp walls, and great
                     fires blazed in the yawning fire-places, and crimson woollen cushions were laid
                     on those fearfully erect, stiff chairs, and the bare, cold floor of cement was
                     well covered with clean, fresh, green rushes, it was not so bad. They made beer
                     and ale of hops, not strychnine in those days. Perhaps Queen Bess was not
                     inclined to rheumatisms or neuralgias. But with all one's hopefulness, one
                     cannot help a small shudder about those same poetical rushes! It must have been
                     so very uncomfortable to put one's feet out of bed, so early in the morning:
                     positively, one shudders to conceive of any body's dainty white feet, drawn
                     from under warm coverings, and set down in the midst of those green rushes! Of
                     course they were wet, fresh every morning, (at least Wolsey had 'em so,)
                     sparkling with dew. Aurora had wept pearly tears all over them, down on the
                     river bank in the meadow, from whence they were cut, in order to supply Her
                     Majesty's luxurious needs. What frights the bower maidens must have been put
                     in, sometimes, by spiders and caterpillars, and grass worms, or perhaps even a
                     very small torpid frog, or spotted toad, or smoothly gliding, noiselessly
                     writhing green snake, lifting itself up suddenly in an unexpected corner, and
                     rearing its head, startling a poor maid with its bright, glassy bead-like eyes,
                     and quick darting, forked, quivering tongue!—Poor Queen Elizabeth!</p>
                  <p>Semiramis and Zenobia were much better off; they had <emph>Persian</emph>
                     carpets! Such studies of color!—the soft, close-woven tissue crushing under the
                     foot like down. If there is any thing disagreeable in this world, it is a
                     wooden floor, as they have in Switzerland, or oil-cloth, as they have <emph>too
                        often</emph> in New England, or bricks and marbles as they have in Italy and
                     Cuba, or stone and rushes as they had in Tudor days in England, in one's
                     bed-chamber!</p>
                  <p>Not the sublimities of Mont Blanc, or of the Bernese Oberland, not the glories
                     of the Alpine Lakes.</p>
                  <p>Not the oranges, and pine-apples, and passion-flowers, and thirty-nine sorts of
                     palms, including the avenues of the Palmas Reales at Havana.</p>
                  <p>Not the wonders of art, nor associations of history, nor even the
                     superabundance of insect-life in Italy; not the splendors, the pearls and
                     velvet, and diamond-appareling of Queen Elizabeth (supposing she dressed
                        <emph>really</emph> in Ristori's style). Not the genius of Shakspeare, not
                     the gallantry of Raleigh, not the dashing victories of Drake, not the diplomacy
                     of Burleigh, not the wisdom of Bacon, nor the religion of Cranmer, nor the
                     Greek and Latin of Ben Jonson, not the supernatural, always to-be-remembered,
                     extolled, and Fourth-of-July-orationed over virtues of all the Pilgrim Fathers,
                     collectively, and the spiritual, historical, metaphysical, æsthetical tical,
                     poetical, ichthyological, zoological, entomological, and geological
                     associations that ever have been, are now, and ever will be connected with
                     Plymouth Rock, could make a reasonable woman contented to put her naked feet on
                     a cold inlaid or oil-cloth floor when she rises in the morning! Ah, ah! poor,
                     dear Queen Elizabeth!! Nobody lived in her rooms at the Hurst now! neither did
                     they occupy the towers of Roman construction, with round arches for doorways,
                     nor the square towers, with battlements and draw-bridges, and portcullis, and
                     moats of Norman building; nor the English suite, with perpendicular lancet, and
                     dreadfully unartistic, early-pointed windows, nor the wing with the Italian
                     facade, like the Villa Albani, nor that planned by Sir Inigo Jones, with such
                     lots of ancient, and pure, and floriated, and Saracenic Gothic; but the one
                     with the open Greek portico, like Pliny's, contained the apartments of Lucia
                     and her governess, while Gerald, and Mr. Vail, and Sir Hugh lived in a modern
                     wing, with plate-glass windows and French upholstery, built and finished by Sir
                     Hugh's father, who had spent some years in France, and rejuvenated the family
                     taste and edifice.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh read the debates in parliament, quarreled with his steward, or his
                     valet, or his tenants, or wrote an essay on the last new turnip, (he preferred
                     Ruta Bagas,) in his office here, en grande Yenue, while his children spent
                     every moment that they could command out of the society of their governess and
                     tutor with good "Cousin Vail" in the library next to Lucia's rooms.</p>
                  <p>Lucia, especially as she grew older, learned to love the gentle, kindly
                     scholar. The library was her favorite resort. She fled there like a lapwing to
                     its nest. The amiable man, so shy and so sensitive, with a nature loving and
                     simple, and pure as a child's, soon found his very heart-strings twining round
                     this daughter of the only woman ever dear to him; the chief happiness of his
                     life consisted in pouring into her docile, inquisitive mind all that he could
                     select from his own store of erudition, that the girl's growing intellect could
                     compass or retain.</p>
                  <p>Such happy hours they had, Lucia and her "Cousin Vail" together in the old
                     library!</p>
                  <p>He was all the world to her, after Gerald, who, of course, occupied the
                     principal shrine in the temple of her affections. She shrunk from her father
                     instinctively. His glances were baleful to her; she grew pale and cowered under
                     them. Sir Hugh knew this. <emph>He</emph> never caressed her, nor put his hand
                     on her glossy brown curls, and blessed her every night and morning, when she
                     entered or quitted his presence, as "Cousin Vail" did. <emph>He</emph> never
                     spent hour after hour reading aloud to her choice passages from famous writers,
                     or in explaining the difficulties of a "hard lesson," or in making her laugh
                     till the old arches rung again, with the humor of Goldsmith, Jean Paul, or
                     Washington Irving. Other humorists, too, there were, but "Cousin Vail" only
                     read selections from many of these. He was so careful, the wise scholar, of the
                     delicate modesty, the perishable feather-dust on the Psyche-wings of that pure,
                     young virgin soul! A good, loving guide he was through the mountains and
                     valleys of literature. Lucia was a very happy little girl when with him. She
                     felt implicit trust in and reliance upon him. She told him
                        "<emph>everything.</emph>" All her sweet child's prattle was his! All her
                     girlish hopes, and aspirations, and fears, about Gerald, were poured into his
                     ear; all her inner life laid bare to his sympathizing eyes, as far as one human
                     soul can be bared to another. Lucia Dare had few thoughts that her
                     guardian-angel grieved to see rise in her clear, crystal heart, and Mr. Vail
                     never saw <emph>any</emph> defilement there. He loved the child as his own
                     soul; she was worthy of his affection.</p>
                  <p>Gerald grew, too, in the atmosphere of the library; but as he increased in
                     stature and in strength, he spent more time out of doors, more half hours with
                     the gamekeepers and about the stables, than Lucia liked. Sometimes, in spite of
                     himself, he would yawn over "Cousin Vail's" readings, and, if he remained in
                     the library, as he frequently did—for, with all his faults, he was passionately
                     attached to his sister—he would throw himself down on the sofa, by her side,
                     put his head in her lap, so she could thread his hair through her fingers, and
                     fondle his handsome head, so thickly matted with black, curling locks. This was
                     the caress he liked best. So while Lucia listened to Cousin Vail, Gerald would
                     read novels, tales of romance and chivalry, stories of King Arthur and his
                     knights, of Lancelot, and Gnenever, of Inistram, and the young Isende, and
                     narratives of exploration, discovery, or travel.</p>
                  <p>Very often, at Lucia's suggestion, Cousin Vail would lay down the Petrarch, or
                     Dante, or sentimental book he was reading to Lucia, and take up Tasso, or The
                     Faery Queen, or Plutarch, or Frorissart, as more congenial and interesting to
                     the fiery, incident-loving Gerald. He was always ready to listen to
                        <emph>them.</emph> He would lie quietly for hours and hear tales of battle
                     and adventure, his arms thrown back over his head as it lay, and firmly clasped
                     around Lucia's waist, looking up into her eyes, with a sudden flash rising in
                     his when any sentence struck a sympathetic chord in his soul, or any deed
                     described of gallant daring roused his fervid imagination, or any touch of true
                     pathos moved his rapid, impulsive, emotional heart. His eagle glance would
                     soften then with a film of moisture, and he met<pb n="14-15"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000008"/> unfailingly in Lucia's dreamy, unfathomable eyes
                     a glance or a tear responsive to his own.</p>
                  <p>Blessed, thrice blessed is the boy that has such a sister!</p>
                  <p>In spite of Sir Hugh, his grandeur, temper, coldness, those children found
                     compensation in each other.</p>
                  <p>Gerald was never more happy, however than when Sir Hugh, at Mr. Vail's
                     solicitation, would permit him to ride with the fox hounds, or hunt with the
                     game-keepers.</p>
                  <p>As Gerald grew older, his father noticed him more; he would call him to
                     accompany him as he rode over the estate, talk to him, point out improvements
                     to be made in future, and try in a strange, shy, haughty way to unbend himself
                     towards his handsome, bold son. He was very proud of the manly boy. He would
                     even take Gerald to London with him, to Parliament, and twice to the Queen's
                     drawing-room, where the spoiled, arrogant boy was noticed and admired by all
                     who saw him, and Sir Hugh was delighted at this incense to vanity. Though Sir
                     Hugh evidently took increasing pleasure in his son's society, yet the more
                     Gerald was with him, the greater the danger of disturbance in the entente
                     cordiale between the two. Gerald was haughty and indignant at petty injustices.
                     Sir Hugh would bear no contradiction. Both were instinctively conscious of the
                     continual risk of collision between such explosive and similar natures, and
                     both struggled to keep, what Plato calls the winged horses of the chariots of
                     their souls, in due subjection. But sometimes a crash would come, and Gerald
                     would rush off then to Lucia, out of his father's presence, in a paroxysm of
                     impotent rage, and incipient rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Lucia would caress and soothe the mentally wounded boy into temporary calm; but
                     the unequal conflicts <emph>would</emph> recur, in spite of all her entreaties
                     and sisterly admonitions to Gerald.</p>
                  <p>"You are only a girl, Lucia, you can't understand a <emph>man's</emph>
                     feelings," Gerald would exclaim. "Papa is perfectly unreasonable! and I tell
                     you, Lucy, if he ever accuses me again, as he did this morning, about that dog
                     of Jim Dodd's—I'll—I'll—"</p>
                  <p>Gerald hesitated; his eyes flashed fire, his lips were compressed, and he
                     stamped his foot with all the pride and passion of a Dare.</p>
                  <p>"Dear, dear Gerald," cried his sister, throwing her arms about him, "you would
                     not do any thing rash to break my heart!"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, Lucy! I don't trust myself! I am not good like you. I am like
                     papa, and I get half mad when papa treats me so! Just as if I was a baby, and
                     not fit to be trusted with any thing. I am old enough to take care of myself
                     and you too, you darling Lucy! I am sixteen years old!"</p>
                  <p>And with sudden change of feeling, the impetuous boy would clasp his sister to
                     his heart and cover her hair and face with kisses. He was so tall now, a head
                     and shoulders above the little clinging maiden; and he began to assert his
                     right of manhood—that of protection. Lucia was very willing to be protected and
                     arrogantly patronized by Gerald. But where, where was to be found discipline
                     and proper training for this noble, erring, volcanic nature? Sir Hugh was too
                     passionate, Mr. Vail too weak, Lucia too gentle, to give it to Gerald! God knew
                     how to provide fire, and forge, and anvil, to soften this iron—to temper it
                     into purest steel. Necessity wields the Thor's hammer of life for all of
                     us.</p>
                  <p>"Lucy," continued Gerald," you are my good angel! If it wasn't for you, I know
                     what I'd do!"</p>
                  <p>"What, Gerald?" anxiously inquired Lucia.</p>
                  <p>"Jim Dodd's going to sea—going next month—I'd go with him! I'm tired of
                     this!—tired of being dictated to like a child! Kept at home like a girl in this
                     out-of-the-way corner of little England. I want to see the world! to see new
                     countries, and old ones. I want to travel, and meet adventures and make
                     discoveries, and—"</p>
                  <p>"Fight at tournaments, and—wind-mills—and free distressed damsels, and discover
                     Utopias and Eldorados, and convert Prestee John!" replied Lucia, laughing.
                     "Wait, Gerald! until you are grown up, and we'll make the grand tour together.
                     Cousin Vail has promised to take us, you know!"</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Vail! Bah! Lucy! We couldn't take the whole library over the world with
                     us, and he'd be wretched without it. It would be rather too much 'impediments,'
                     as your favorite, the antiquary, phrases it. Now, as far as you are concerned,
                     I would like it well enough; but Cousin Vail, his man, his manuscripts and
                     folios; Mr. Edmunson, my tutor, and George, my man, and your governess, and
                     your maid, and all the trunks and bandboxes—what sort of a time would a fellow
                     have traveling with such a caravan to see the world? How would he see life? No!
                     no! Lucy—I must go first, by myself, some day or other."</p>
                  <p>"But not with Jim Dodd! Gerald—promise me, not with Jim Dodd!"</p>
                  <p>"Well! I don't think with Jim Dodd, <emph>this</emph> time," replied Gerald,
                     slowly and thoughtfully, with his eyes fixed upon the carpet. Then lifting his
                     glance to the tender brown eyes, gazing with such anxiety and fondness on him,
                     "Little woman"—this was Gerald's pet name for his sister—"Little
                     woman"—pausing, taking her hand, and plaiting the long slender fingers, one
                     over the other, as he held them in both of his hands—</p>
                  <p>"I wish you would come with me today! I want so much to ride to John Dodd's
                     cottage. He fell down the old quarry and is badly hurt. Jim sent word to me
                     this morning about it; and he told Jim to ask me to come to see him. They say
                     he is going to die!"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Gerald, that is dreadful! But I am almost afraid for you to go there—papa
                     will be so angry! He has been so positive in forbidding all association with
                     the Dodd's since he turned them off the manor on account of John Dodd's voting
                     for Mr. St. Leger. Can't you write or send, Gerald? perhaps John Dodd is not so
                     ill. Indeed, Gerald, it would be dangerous for you to go. It would be, best for
                     me to go alone, if necessary. Don't you think so, Gerald? Papa might not be so
                     angry at my disobedience, in such a matter, as I am only a girl, and wouldn't
                     answer him back, if he scolded; but, oh! Gerald, don't you go!—don't,
                     especially after this morning! What was it about the dog? I did not understand
                     about the affair clearly—something about the Dodds', I know."</p>
                  <p>"It was about a fine hound puppy, Jim Dodd had reared for me. He sent it to me
                     as a parting present, this morning. I was standing at the gate-way, talking
                     with the man who brought it, one of the miners from Goodall's. He told me about
                     John's falling down the quarry, when papa came out. Seeing the man and dog, he
                     asked me what I was doing with them. I told him the truth. He became furiously
                     angry at the impertinence of the Dodds—of any member of that family, under his
                     ban, presuming to send any thing to Hurst. He raged and swore at the man, and
                     the dog, and at me. I tell you, Lucia, it was hard to bear."</p>
                  <p>The boy's lip quivered, and his chest swelled as he drew a long breath, with
                     his white teeth set together.</p>
                  <p>Lucia raised her hand and smoothed the heavy damp curls off his flushed
                     forehead.</p>
                  <p>"I know it is hard for you to bear, dear, with your quick temper; but it is
                        <emph>papa,</emph> Gerald!"</p>
                  <p>"Don't I know that, Lucy—and all you mean by that? I know <emph>it is
                        papa!</emph> No one else would <emph>dare</emph> to treat me so! I'd kill
                     any other man who dared to speak so to me!—at least I'd try to."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Gerald! what will become of you? such a fiery nature! Oh! Gerald, you make
                     me so uneasy!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, Lucy," replied Gerald, more meekly, mollified by his sister's caresses,
                     desirous to soothe her anxiety, and also to <emph>gain his point</emph>—the
                     visit to the Dodd cottage. "Well, Lucy darling! I am not going to kill any body
                     now, so you needn't look so scared! But say now, will you go with me? Poor John
                     Dodd! that loved mamma so much! Don't you remember the tales he used to tell
                     us, about her coming to the Hurst, and he was her gardener, and about her when
                     she was a little girl at Courtenay?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Lucia, thoughtfully, "I know. I like John Dodd—always did. When I
                     was a little girl, he took such pains with my garden that Cousin Vail got papa
                     to let me have made in the corner of the parterre, near the library. He used to
                     tell me a great deal about mamma—he showed me all the flowers she liked, and
                     planted them for me—all the Eastern flowers; the great poppies, and tulips, and
                     pomegranates, and jasmines, and roses. Yes, I like John Dodd! I was sorry when
                     papa sent him away. How did he make papa so angry? Why did he vote for Mr. St.
                     Leger instead of Mr. Aubrey? He knew papa would never forgive that, Gerald!
                     Papa makes the tenants vote to please him, you know."</p>
                  <p>"But see here, Lucia, Mr. St. Leger was an old friend of mamma's, and John knew
                     him when he was a boy, and he lived on the Courtney estate long before John
                     came to live here as gardener. Papa used to like Mr. St. Leger. Nobody knows
                     why, just at the last minute, at the very polls, he whirled around and ordered
                     the tenants to vote for Mr. Aubrey! There never had been a yellow ticket voted
                     here in this district before."</p>
                  <p>"Well; John Dodd need not have voted at all. It would have been better, so long
                     as papa was opposed to Mr. St. Leger."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! Lucia, girls never know! I—John is a free born Briton, and has a
                     conscience, I suppose. He had a right to vote for the man he liked the best. He
                     had promised Mr. St. Leger, when papa approved. It was papa that was wrong. He
                     forgot he wasn't Sir Hugo Dare of the eleventh century, and that John was no
                     serf, with an iron collar around his neck, like Wurth's, in Ivanhoe!"</p>
                  <p>"Well! it only caused John's being turned off, out of his pretty home, in the
                     gardener's lodge, where he had lived so long," replied Lucia, simply, "and you
                     know, since that time, he could get no work in the village, on account of
                     papa's displeasure at him. So he and Jim have had to work in Mr. Goodall's
                     mines, to make money to live on; and you see what has come of it all,
                     Gerald."</p>
                  <p>"There's no use talking, Lucia! If John was imprudent, which I don't
                     deny—though I think he was right to keep his promise—papa had no business to
                     dictate. If I was a tenant, I wouldn't submit to such exaction—no! I wouldn't!
                     I'd do like Simon de Montfort and the great Barons." Gerald doubled up his
                     fist, and shook it menacingly<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6308-00000009"/> ly at an
                     invisible foe—"I'd resist oppression!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia caught his clenched hand, and putting it to her lips, laid her cheek on
                     it. It relaxed instantaneously. Gerald's face changed as his fingers sunk
                     open.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Lucy! Lucy! I never, never can be good long!" he murmured, bending over
                     his sister and kissing her.</p>
                  <p>"Oh yes! you can. Yes! you will, my darling Gerald!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, will you go to John Dodd's? just this once—if you <emph>do</emph> love
                     me, go Lucy! Poor John is surely going to die, and Jim has to go away; and I
                     know papa hurt poor Jim's feelings about the puppy, Lucy. It was for
                        <emph>me</emph> Jim reared it. I asked him to send it, Lucy. It was all my
                     fault. Go with me just this once, dear little woman, please."</p>
                  <p>Lucia looked at Gerald, distressed and doubtful.</p>
                  <p>"If papa hears of it, he will be so angry, I <emph>know,</emph> Gerald. Let us
                     ask Cousin Vail—perhaps <emph>he</emph> will go to see John!"</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense! Cousin Vail! What good can he do? John don't want to see
                        <emph>him.</emph> It is I—he wants to come, Lucia, and I shall go—alone, if
                     you don't choose to come."</p>
                  <p>Gerald spoke haughtily—turning on his heel, he walked away from his sister.</p>
                  <p>"Gerald, stop! Gerald, don't go! It is only for you that I dread papa's anger;
                     but I see you are resolved to do this thing, Gerald. You shan't go alone. If
                     you <emph>will</emph> get into trouble, why then, my darling—my darling, I will
                     go too!"</p>
                  <p>The girl set her lips together firmly, pale with apprehension, but resolved,
                     like a true woman, she would share the risks, the danger of suffering with the
                     idol of her heart, though she saw more clearly than he, the abyss into which he
                     was resolute to plunge. She knew Sir Hugh better than he. How often in slight
                     as well as great events in this drama of human life, the words of He-loise to
                     Abelard are felt and acted upon, by women whose nerves and muscles are weak,
                     but whose hearts are strong to suffer with their beloved ones—"For God knows I
                     should not have hesitated to follow you at your command, if you had been
                     hastening to <emph>perdition;</emph> for my heart was not with me, but
                        <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"That's my Lucy!" Gerald kissed her now, with eager satisfaction. "I will order
                     the horses; you go, get your habit on; tell Cousin Vail you are going to ride
                     with me, so he won't be anxious whilst you are gone. You know John Dodd's is
                     ten miles off; he lives near the stone quarry, on the moor. We'll have to ride
                     fast."</p>
                  <p>Gerald's mercurial temper rallied immediately as soon as he gained his point.
                     He sprang almost joyfully out of the room, whistling merrily an Irish jig tune,
                     as he went to order the horses. Lucia walked slowly and reluctantly to the
                     library.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail was bending over a folio as she entered and stood by his side. He
                     looked up, taking off his spectacles, and putting them down on the open page to
                     keep his place, as he turned to her.</p>
                  <p>"What is it, my little Lucy?"</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Vail, I am going to ride out with Gerald, and shall be gone perhaps
                     several hours. We mean to take a long ride. Don't be anxious about me; papa
                     will scarcely need us before we return. If he should ask, please excuse us to
                     him."</p>
                  <p>"I will, my pet. Is that all?"</p>
                  <p>"That's all just now, Cousin Vail. Oh! will you give me some money—a good deal,
                     please, for a poor person who is ill?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail took out his purse and laid it with its glittering contents in the
                     extended pink hand. Lucia took it, and held up her mouth to be kissed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail gazed tenderly after the slight, graceful figure, until the girl had
                     disappeared through the door-way, then he sighed—"poor children! poor little
                     sensitive Lucy—"poor Sybilla!" His thoughts wandered off—far back to his own
                     boyhood, when Sybilla Courtenay was the unconscious subject of his
                     life-dreams—so young and tender, and so fair! Lucia was growing so like
                     her.</p>
                  <p>The old man's revery was broken off by the splashing of a drop on the page
                     before him. He put his hand to his eyes: "Tears in my old eyes! What a fool—she
                     never, never knew it!"</p>
                  <p>Drawing out his pocket-handkerchief, he wiped his eyes, took up his spectacles
                     off the book, polished them with the handkerchief, replaced them on his nose,
                     and resumed his reading, as he recited to himself in a low tone, these lines
                     from Ovid's Tristia: <q>

                  <head type="sub">THE MINER'S VILLAGE.</head>
                  <p>ENGLISH farm-houses are not generally picturesque, or handsome. It is rare to
                     find the gabled cottage, with its flourishing vines, and blossoming roses,
                     imaged by romantic imaginations. Laborers' houses are seldom more than hovels,
                     either in England or Ireland. It is only in Switzerland that poverty is
                     picturesque.</p>
                  <p>John Dodd's house was one of the uglies, and most uncomfortable of such
                     constructions. Two low rooms with sheds attached in the rear, built out on the
                     open, dreary moor. No enclosure about it, not a tree, nor a flower to soften or
                     poetize the hard, cold reality of poverty, and ugliness, and physical
                     suffering. Several miles off, low bald, round-topped hills rose blankly against
                     the sky—the hills where the tin mines were located. Nearer to these hills, two
                     or three miles distant from John Dodd's, stood the village where the miners
                     lived, at least such of them as did live above ground, for there was a teeming
                     population far down in the bowels of the earth, men, and women, and young
                     girls, and little children, who never was the light of the sun, except as it
                     glimmered down through the long wells of the shafts. These people groped, and
                     worked, and died, and were brought up out of the dark mines to be buried in the
                     earth, not quite so deeply <emph>after</emph> Death as they had been while they
                     breathed, and were said to be alive."</p>
                  <p>These wretched, dirty, swarming, creeping creatures, who scarcely deserved the
                     names of human beings—humanity was almost crushed and bruised out of
                        them—<emph>who</emph> cared to have <emph>them</emph> washed, or fed, or
                     clad, or treated like responsible people <emph>with souls? Who</emph> cared for
                     the sufferings of those women about to become mothers, working all the time, on
                     their knees, on all fours, dragging the heavy cars of ore, or of those
                     brutalized young girls, wild, filthy, disheveled, ragged—every quality of
                     womanhood perverted, except her comparative physical weakness, and alas! her
                     inalienable capacity to suffer from complex organization, from elementary
                     preponderance of the instincts of natural affection, and the necessity of love
                     and sympathy, which her very structure demands. Women, intended by God for the
                     duties of wives and mothers, have always a wonderful capacity, a stolid power
                     of endurance of bodily and mental pain, that often, often works against them,
                     which, intended for the consolation and benefit of man, is turned by his
                     cruelty into service as instruments of torture! Philanthropists might cast one
                     glance towards the collieries, after they get through with the Southern States
                     of America.</p>
                  <p>Lucia and Gerald rode through the village without drawing rein. They wanted to
                     accomplish the clandestine visit and to get home, if possible, before their
                     father might call for them.</p>
                  <p>Lucia had never been in this part of the country before. She shuddered at the
                     gloomy aspect of the village, and the fierce visages that glared at her so
                     enviously as she rode past them. A wild looking girl, ragged, dirty, with her
                     rough, black unkempt hair streaming over her half-bare shoulders, like a
                     horse's mane, came out of one of the wretched houses, and stood, holding an old
                     broom in her hand, laughing coarsely as Lucia rode by. "Hooray, Dick!" she
                     cried aloud to a dirty man, grimed with soot and cinder, who was lounging on
                     the opposite side of the village street. "Hooray, Dick! an't we foine? Don't I
                     wish it war me! But no such luck for the likes o' us!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia checked her horse quickly as she heard the vulgar sneer. Gerald's face
                     flushed in anger. But Lucia stopped her horse in front of the girl, and leaning
                     down from the saddle, she extended her fingers to the hard, broom-uplifted hand
                     of the miserable girl, as she threw it out derisively towards "the leddy," and
                     laying a piece of gold in it, said gently—</p>
                  <p>"You must not think, poor girl, that any body is perfectly happy. Every body
                     has some trouble and sorrow in this world! I am sorry to see a girl suffer, as
                     I fear <emph>you</emph> must have done!"</p>
                  <p>It was not the money. It was not the words, said with all the grace and
                     simplicity of a little child. It was the manner—the womanly pity Lucia
                     exhibited, which subdued the fierce, wild beast nature. The girl seized Lucia's
                     small-gloved hand, pressed it to her lips, burst into tears, and throwing her
                     ragged apron over her head, rushed back into the house sobbing
                     passionately.</p>
                  <p>The man on the other side of the street, beholding this transaction; took his
                     dirty cap off his head, his dirty pipe out of his mouth, made an awkward
                     "reverence" to the "leddy" as she passed him; then stood erect, looking after
                     her with his eyes and mouth stretched to their widest extent, until she and
                     Gerald were reduced to mere specks in the distance; then recovering himself, he
                     drew a long breath, and shutting his mouth, ejaculated emphatically—"Well! I
                     never!" Sitting slowly down on a broken door-step in the sunshine, he remained
                     ruminating apparently on the extraordinary incident just enacted, judging from
                     his occasional repetition of the words—"Well! I never!"</p>
                  <p>The girl came out of the house again—her eyes moist, and streaks of lighter hue
                     on her dirty cheeks, showing where the tears had rolled, washing the skin
                     whiter in spots. She was still catching her breath, in a half-sobbing way.</p>
                  <p>"Is they gone out o' sight, Dick?"</p>
                  <p>The man nodded, pointed with his finger over the moor, his pipe still between
                     his teeth; taking it out, and blowing a whiff of smoke, he ejaculated: "Well, I
                     never! Where can they be goin'? That's Miss Dare, that is!"</p>
                  <p>"An' she's a hangel! I'm blest if she an't!" exclaimed the girl, eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes! she don't seem to want nuthin' but wings!" answered Dick, meditatively,
                     using his finger for a tobacco stopper.</p>
                  <p>"Can you see 'em yet, Dick?"—the girl<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6308-00000010"/>
                     put her hands up to shade the sunshine, as she peered over the moor.</p>
                  <p>"I kin just see two little black specks"—the man rose to his feet and gazed
                     keenly over the moor. "I kin just see two black specks; 'pears to me, they're
                     stoppin' now at John Dodd's."</p>
                  <p>"Shouldn't wonder an' they wos," said the girl, "John Dodd wor an ole tenan' of
                     Sir Hugh's."</p>
                  <p>"I know he war," rejoined the man; "but he won't be nobody's tenan' on this
                     yearth by this time to-morrow, from what I hearn the doctor say this mornin',
                     Liz."</p>
                  <p>"Is he so bad hurt as that?" asked Liz.</p>
                  <p>"He's awful hurted. Lord, girl, when they tuk him out of the ole quarry yester
                     morn, he warn't like a human, he was so squashed and broke to pieces!"</p>
                  <p>"Did you see him tuk out, Dick?" inquired Liz, with shuddering interest.</p>
                  <p>"Yes! I help take him out; it wasn't an easy job nayther. I an't feared o'
                     much, but that's an ugly bit, that old quarry! His son Jim an' me went down on
                     ropes, an' they rigged up a sort o' win-lass, and sent down a basket, an' Jim
                     an' me got John in it; an' they drew 'em up. But t'war a bad sight, sure!"</p>
                  <p>Dick relieved his mouth by a vigorous expectoration, poked his pipe with a bit
                     of stick, and replaced it between his lips.</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow! poor John!" said the girl, passionately, "we gets used to such
                     sights as that, even, somehow! Men and women killed, crushed in the mines! Oh!
                     I hate 'em, Dick! how I hate 'em! Them cruel, dark mines, wearin' the life out
                     of our bodies and the goodness out of our souls!"</p>
                  <p>The man looked at her, as she stood shaking her clenched hand, vehemently, in
                     the direction of the mines.</p>
                  <p>"You are quarrelin' with your bread an butter, Liz!"</p>
                  <p>"I don't care if I be! I'd sooner be a bafrican slave, than work in 'em!"</p>
                  <p>"You dun not know nothin' of the troubles of a hafrican slave, Liz. 'Member
                     what Miss Dare said, 'there an't no place whatsumever without its troubles,'"
                     replied Dick, sententiously. "An' a sure an' a pretty word it was for her to
                     say, to the likes of you."</p>
                  <p>"If there war more o' the likes o' her in the world, there would surely be
                     fewer o' the likes o' me or my sort, Dick."</p>
                  <p>"When it comes to that, you an't ra-al bad, nohow, Liz. Sort o' wild-like, you
                     are; but not so ill-dispoged, as a man mout say; an' if you was to wash your
                     face an' rowl up your hair, an' tidy up a bit, you wouldn't be so bad-lookin',
                     nayther."</p>
                  <p>Liz felt the implied flattery, like a woman; she put up her hands, threw back
                     the long elf locks, with a smile on her lips.</p>
                  <p>"None o' your palaver, Dick. I am go in' to buy mysen' a new gown with this
                     'ere," taking the gold-piece out of her bosom, "an' shoes an' stockins, and
                     make mysen' cleaner and more decent-like, for the sake o' her as gived it."</p>
                  <p>Dick nodded approvingly.</p>
                  <p>"The way to begin to make a woman good and 'self-respectin',' is to make her
                     clean an' smart, Liz—I allus believed in that."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I'm goin' to begin. I wonder will she come back again this ere
                     way?"</p>
                  <p>"She'll have to, no doubt, seem' there an't no other way to the Hurst 'cept
                     through this 'ere village."</p>
                  <p>"Then I'll run and tidy up a bit, agin' she passes."</p>
                  <p>Browning is right—there are "Pippas" in the world, whose simple crossings over
                     the paths of others educe good, pure, and better thoughts, even in depraved,
                     degraded natures. Lucia Dare was a "Pippa."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">JOHN DODD.</head>
                  <p>THERE was not a sound audible when sister and brother dismounted at the door of
                     John Dodd's cottage. Gerald, looking around for something to fasten the bridles
                     of their horses to (for they had rejected the customary attendance of their
                     groom on this clandestine visit of compassion) discovered nothing eligible but
                     a large stone; laying the ends of the reins on the ground, he rolled the piece
                     of rock on the top of them.</p>
                  <p>"I think that will hold them," he said, laughing at his improvised
                     horse-rack.—"You go in, Lucia; let me watch a minute, to see if they can pull
                     away."</p>
                  <p>Lucia smiled; but pushing back the slightly-closed door, she entered upon a
                     scene which checked all signs of gladness on her face.</p>
                  <p>On a low, flock bed, in the centre of the room, lay the mangled, crushed,
                     broken mass, that only yesterday was the active, hale, vigorous, though elderly
                     form of their mother's old gardener. The broken arms swathed in splints and
                     bandages, lay stiff, straight and helpless, over the faded, but clean quilt,
                     that was decently spread above him. His head was bound with a coarse, white
                     cloth, stained in some places with blood from wounds in the forehead. The rest
                     of his face was uninjured; he could move his eyes, and could speak in a very,
                     very low whisper.</p>
                  <p>By the side of his bed knelt his son "Jim," holding a cup filled with
                     stimulating drink, from which, as Lucia entered, Mary Dodd, a girl of sixteen
                     years, was just in the act of administering a spoonful to her fast-sinking
                     father. John Dodd opened his eyes as his daughter put the spoon to his lips,
                     and swallowed the cordial slowly and with evidently increasing difficulty. An
                     expression of anguish passed quickly over Mary Dodd's rather pretty, though
                     commonly dull countenance, as she saw how slowly her father was able to swallow
                     the few drops of liquid she had poured into his mouth. She put her hands up to
                     her eyes, and turned away with a gesture of impotent grief.</p>
                  <p>Jim Dodd's hand trembled, as he held the held cup, and he bit his lips as he
                     remarked his sister's irrepressible emotion. It made him droop his head for an
                     instant on to the side of the coarse pallet. There was no word of complaint, no
                     outcry of passion, but deep grief and restrained sorrow, still more touching in
                     the manner of these poor, honest people. Lucia laid her hand softly on the arm
                     of the quietly weeping daughter; Mary sobbed once, aloud, as she felt the touch
                     of that sympathizing hand; then smothering her sobs, she bowed her head on
                     Lucia's arm, and wept there silently. The gentle, highly bred girl, put her arm
                     softly over the neck of the afflicted peasant; her beautiful brown eyes were
                     full of tears. Not a word was spoken by any of them.</p>
                  <p>Gerald now joined the sorrowful group. Jim Dodd rose from his knees, to greet
                     "the young maister."</p>
                  <p>Gerald seized Jim's hand, wrung it warmly, as he whispered, "I am sorry for
                     you, Jim."</p>
                  <p>Jim's lip quivered. "I knowed you'd be, Maister Gerald. Feyther set a store by
                     you and Miss Lucia."</p>
                  <p>The whispers roused the dying man; he opened his eyes again; they were dim, but
                     he was entirely conscious. He recognized Gerald, who bent over the pallet, with
                     such a look of speechless awe and pity. John smiled and spoke in a feeble tone,
                     answering Gerald's look of sympathy.</p>
                  <p>"It's—pretty—bad—to—look—at—I—know—thank
                     ye—kindly—for—coming—Maister—Gerald."</p>
                  <p>The words were scarcely more than breathed; with sad breaks in the breath, and
                     pauses between each word. John could say no more just then; but he looked up
                     into Gerald's face, with a glance of grateful content. Lucia came forward and
                     laid her hand on the helpless one lying outside the coverlet. John smiled
                     again—a quick, pleased smile.</p>
                  <p>"God—bless—Miss—Lucia—so—like—my Leddy!"</p>
                  <p>Gerald bent over him nearer.</p>
                  <p>"John, is there anything, I—anything <emph>we</emph>—can do for you?"</p>
                  <p>John winked his eyelids—</p>
                  <p>"Feyther says 'Yes,' Maister Gerald," said Mary Dodd.</p>
                  <p>"What is it, John? I'll do it—if possible, I'll do it," exclaimed Gerald,
                     eagerly.</p>
                  <p>"Would—like—to—be—buried—in—grav e-yard—Hurst—next—wife—outside
                     church—where—Leddy—Sybilla—buried!"</p>
                  <p>Gerald's face flushed. "It shall be done," said Gerald, resolutely.</p>
                  <p>"Children—kind." John looked up anxiously in Gerald's face.</p>
                  <p>"John," said Jerald, putting his hand on Jim Dodd's shoulder, "I will do all I
                     can for your children, when I have any power, and so will my sister. You know I
                     am only a lad yet, and can't do much; but I well never forget them,
                     John—never."</p>
                  <p>John closed his eyes—he was satisfied; but he spoke once more.</p>
                  <p>"Tell—Sir Hugh—sorry—vexed—him—but—Mr. St. Leger—old—friend—my—Leddy."</p>
                  <p>Gerald's face darkened as he was reminded thus of Sir Hugh's anger towards the
                     poor gardener. The promises he had made to the dying man might be difficult to
                     keep; but Gerald was a Dare; he meant to keep them, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >coute qui coute.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>John's mind being thus set at rest on the only points that were troubling it,
                     he lay quiet, and gradually sunk off into slumber. Gerald and Lucia sat
                     silently watching with his children, the pallid, unconscious countenance of the
                     old servant. His breath was coming more and more feebly; sometimes he muttered
                     half-broken sentences. "No—no—Susan—not that rose—my Leddy's—favorite—move—it
                     here—closer to the—glass—more—light—more light."</p>
                  <p>Then he slumbered deeper.</p>
                  <p>Lucia whispered to Gerald, it was time to leave.</p>
                  <p>Gerald shook hands again with Jim Dodd; Lucia, with Mary, slipping several gold
                     pieces in the girl's hand as she did so. Then with a parting glance at the
                     sleeping John, they quitted the poor cottage.</p>
                  <p>Jim Dodd followed them out of the door, gathered up the reins, and held the
                     horses, while Gerald extended his hand to receive Lucia's foot as she
                     mounted.</p>
                  <p>"Jim," said Gerald, "this will interfere with your going to America—won't
                     it?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Master Gerald it'll hasten me off the sooner. I'll have nothin' to hold me
                     back now, if fayther goes, which of course he's bound to." Jim brushed his eyes
                     with his coat sleeve. "My sister Mary, she's goin' to marry one of the boys at
                     the mines; a sort o' rough clerk—like—so she'll be purvided for better nor I
                     can do it; so I'll just make up my bundle an' trudge. It'll be best for me. I
                     don't like mining. I couldn't get no work at Hurst—they say there's plenty of
                     work to be got in Ameriky, of different sorts."</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6308-00000011"/>
                  <p>"Well, Jim; you'll let me hear from you before you go?" Gerald slipped his
                     purse in the hand of his humble friend. Sir Hugh never allowed his heir to be
                     without ample pocket money; though not much of it was used so charitably as
                     this. The game-keepers got most of it, usually.</p>
                  <p>Gerald and Lucia turned their horses heads homeward.</p>
                  <p>As they rode rapidly through the village, Liz darted out from her house,
                     startling Lucia's spirited horse, as she sprang in the street before it. Liz
                     was quite metamorphosed. Her coal-black hair was neatly coiled up at the back
                     of her head; her brown face shone from soap and water; she had on a clean
                     frock; her rosy cheeks like winter apples; white teeth, smiling mouth, and
                     bright eyes, made a pleasant picture, as she held out awkwardly enough to Lucia
                     a rustic bouquet of a few fragrant violets and white lilies of the valley, tied
                     up with a bit of scarlet riband, one of Liz's most cherished pieces of
                     finery.</p>
                  <p>"Take 'em, please, Miss!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia scarcely recognized the wild-looking, dirty girl, in this really pretty
                     creature. Smilingly she took the humble offering, and fastened it in her
                     belt-riband, saying—</p>
                  <p>"Thank you. I love violets and these lilies."</p>
                  <p>"I thought you would like it," said Liz, her face glowing with gratification,
                     "'cause you 'mind me of sweet smellin' flowers like 'em."</p>
                  <p>Lucia nodded pleasantly; then she and Gerald put their horses at speed, and
                     rode rapidly on.</p>
                  <p>"Sir Hugh had not inquired for them," Mr. Vail said, when they reached the
                     quiet library, almost out of breath, from fast riding.</p>
                  <p>The sister and brother hurried off to make a toilette, in order to meet their
                     father at dinner—Lucia truly thankful to have escaped, so far, his dreaded
                     wrath. The insouciant Gerald, gratified at accomplishing his visit, almost
                     forgot about his father's prejudices against the Dodds, and was in high
                     spirits; very gracious and amiable to every body—his father included.</p>

                  <p>IT was late next day, nearly dark, when Gerald came into the library, where Mr.
                     Vail was sitting, as usual, in his easy chair, book in hand. Lucia had opened a
                     glazed door, leading out of a bay window, by a short flight of marble steps,
                     into a fanciful parterre, called her garden; as it had been carefully arranged
                     according to her fancy, after her own plan, by poor John Dodd, when he was
                     acting in his professional capacity at the Hurst.</p>
                  <p>There were as many kinds of gardens in the Hurst grounds as there were
                     different styles of architecture in the house. French parterres, with curious
                     geometric beds, bordered with turf, or ivy, or diminutive box-edgings,
                     presenting a continuous succession of blossoming shrubs and annuals,
                     interspersed with graveled walks and fountains, where Tritons blew water out of
                     conch-shells. Then there were stiffer, more stately Italian gardens, where the
                     flowerbeds were built up on low stone walls—and so elevated the gay bloom
                     several feet above the walks. These had avenues of marble vases on pedestals,
                     in which grew trained orange, and lemon, and tamarisk trees; and the fragrant
                     yellow-balls of acacias perfumed the air here.</p>
                  <p>Here were scattered statues of goddesses and Fauns and marbles, built up into
                     pavilions and terraces, and broad stone staircases leading down in a flight of
                     a hundred steps from water temples, whence the water sprang up, first in jets
                     d'eaux, then tumbled foaming down over the steps, forming beautiful
                     cascatelles, which, disappearing at the foot, under ground, reappeared, flowing
                     like Arethusa's fountain lower down, in a silver brook, towards the artificial
                     lakes, where "les grandes eaux" played perpetually—green and hot-bonses, where
                     tree-ferns and air-plants and orchards flourished in spite of the cold English
                     climate, were not wanting.</p>
                  <p>There were hanging gardens like those of Babylon, and Chinese gardens,
                     wonderful as that of Sse-makou-ang, the famous prime-minister of the Emperor
                     Song, upon which a whole book of poems was written by the literati, among the
                     Celestials in the eleventh century.</p>
                  <p>But Lucia's garden was like none of these. It was a smooth lawn of shortest,
                     well-mown grass, green as an emerald—out of this were cut Arabesque figures,
                     all embroidered upon with massed flowers, according to the instinct of
                     harmonious color, which belongs to the East, and came to Lucia through her
                     half-Syrian ancestry.</p>
                  <p>There were glorious "chords," of red, blue, and yellow; there were artfully
                     constructed piles of pure white roses, and snow-balls and wax-plants—all the
                     ugly pots concealed with growing ivy and other native creepers. There were
                     pyramids of crimson salvias, and stacks of blue salvias, with nasturtiums and
                     ice-moss tumbling down the sides of the heaps in skilful confusion. There were
                     large wicker-baskets of verbenas, with quamoclit blooming its red and white
                     stars all over the huge handles. There were roots, and stumps, and rocks thrown
                     up in fantastic mounds, supporting rude vases and urns of Terracotta, all
                     filled with heliotrope, and jasmines, and honeysuckles; and there were white
                     lilies every where. Indeed, nothing was more remarkable in Lucia's garden than
                     the unusual predominance of bulbs. There were, of course, "lots" of roses, and
                     of what we may call elementary flowers, in a garden. Such as roses, spiroeas,
                     pinks, carnations, gilly-flowers, wall-flowers, jasmines, chinaasters,
                     Wistarias, clematis, sweet peas, convolvuli, poppies, larkspurs, (of course
                        <emph>only double</emph> larkspurs,) chrysanthemines, (especially
                     Pomponnes,) pelargoniums and geraniums.</p>
                  <p>But everywhere, stuck in at the end of the brilliant ribands of calceolarias,
                     which wound their red, purple, and spotted yellow, serpent coils over the green
                     grass, poked in every corner of the mounds, peeping out of the terraces, and
                     flaunting over the pyramids—in their own separate compartments, everywhere they
                     ought to have been, and frequently where they ought not to have been—one saw
                     the intrusive heads of Japan lilies, hyacinths, polyanthus, narcissi and
                     tuberoses, tulip and gladioli, amaryllis and tigridas, and over and throughout
                     all a plentiful besprinkling of violets and lilies of the valley.</p>
                  <p>Surely Lucia was fond of bulbs; and if Swedenborg's idea has anything in it,
                     that rose blooms come from the creative flux which makes the thoughts of pure,
                     young girls—or Mr. Draper's, as to the mutual influence of vegetable and human
                     life—there was undoubtedly some physiological and psychological reason for
                     Lucia's loving bulbs so very much, and keeping them about her as she did.</p>
                  <p>Gerald walked hastily through the library, without stopping to speak to Mr.
                     Vail, stepped out through the open window, and found his sister.</p>
                  <p>Lucia was sitting on the upper step of the short flight of marble stairs that
                     led down into her garden, from the open terrace next the window. She was gazing
                     at the sunset, her hands indolently folded on her lap, as she half-reclined on
                     the step, leaning against the marble balustrade, enjoying quietly the beauty
                     and bloom around her.</p>
                  <p>The air was heavy with the fragrance of the strongly-scented hyacinths,
                     tuberoses, and lilies. Some women would have been overpowered by it, but Lucia
                     breathed it with delight.</p>
                  <p>Gerald threw himself down by her side impatiently, and, not heeding the
                     caressing arm which stole instantaneously about his neck, he burst out with a
                     passionate exclamation of anger and boyish despair—</p>
                  <p>"I wish I was dead! Lucia, I do."</p>
                  <p>The boy ground his teeth in rage.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Gerald, my Gerald! What is it? What makes you say such a dreadful
                     thing?"</p>
                  <p>Lucia was fully aroused now; both arms were around Gerald, and her cheek was
                     pressed lovingly to his hot, burning face.</p>
                  <p>The boy burst into tears, and throwing his arms around his sister, wept with
                     the intense bitterness and passion of a proud, sensitive, mortified, young
                     nature. It was a real gust, a thunderstorm in his soul. He could not speak
                     until his rage had exhausted itself, and he had wept his passion clear.</p>
                  <p>Lucia, with true womanly instinct, did not speak to him, nor harass him with
                     questions she saw he was not in condition to reply to, but contented herself
                     with clasping him closer to her bosom, and pressing her lips silently again and
                     again upon his forehead and curly hair.</p>
                  <p>At last the terrible sobs ceased, and Gerald lifted his face from his sister's
                     true heart.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lucy, you think me weak as a baby, to cry so; but—"</p>
                  <p>Gerald's lip quivered, and his eyes filled up again.</p>
                  <p>"No, darling! I know it must be something very serious to make you so very
                     unhappy! What is it, my precious?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Papa,</emph> Lucia, it is always <emph>papa!</emph>" replied the boy,
                     bitterly. "Do, you believe, Lucy, that, to-day, he rode by the churchyard in
                     Hurst, which he has not an atom of right to control, and saw the old sexton
                     digging the grave for poor John Dodd! He died last night, Lucy. Jim sent me
                     word this morning. His last words were a message to thank me for coming to see
                     him, and for promising to have him buried by poor Susan, his wife. Well, I went
                     to Mr. Devere this morning, and told him about John, and what he had begged of
                     me; and Mr. Devere was very kind, and said he would read the service over poor
                     John, that he would like to do it, he had always thought so well of John, and
                     was sorry when he had been forced to quit the parish. The funeral was to have
                     been this evening, very quiet, not wishing to vex papa more than we could help,
                     though he is so unjust; but papa saw the sexton digging the grave. The sexton
                     told him it was for John. Papa became very angry, and demanded who had ordered
                     this. The sexton said, 'Mr. Devere, the curate.' Papa went to Mr. Devere, and
                     haughtily required the order to be countermanded. Mr. Devere, who is not afraid
                     of papa, refused, saying, mildly, 'That he had been informed it was the man's
                     dying request to be buried next his wife; that John had humbly requested Sir
                     Hugh's forgiveness for having offended him; that he could not conscientiously
                     refuse John's request; as a Christian priest, he had certain duties to perform,
                     and he was obliged to consider his accountability to God as well as obligation
                     to any patron!' Papa was furious. Leaving Mr. Devere, he rode immediately over
                     to the Rectory, and demanded of Mr.<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6308-00000012"/>
                     Temple the discharge of the eurate. You know Mr. Temple. He has not a
                     self-reliant atom in his nature! He succumbed immediately to papa's will, and
                     sitting down wrote to Mr. Devere he had no farther occasion for his services,
                     as curate in Hurst. Then he countermanded the order for poor John's burial; and
                     Mr. Devere has gone now over to Goodall's, to bring him there. Now, Lucy, here
                     is poor Mr. Devere, his wife, and children, thrown out of their home and
                     living!—all by my act, not his. Oh! what shall I do, Lucy? What can I do?"</p>
                  <p>Gerald buried his face in his hands, and the tears trickled through his
                     fingers.</p>
                  <p>Lucia was nearly as much troubled now as Gerald; but she sat quietly, running
                     her slender fingers through Gerald's matted curls.</p>
                  <p>"Gerald, I think the first thing for us to do is to tell Cousin Vail. Perhaps
                     he can help us."</p>
                  <p>Gerald lifted his face from his hands.</p>
                  <p>"Well, what then, Lucia?"</p>
                  <p>"I think we had better, next, go to papa, and tell him the truth—"</p>
                  <p>"Or get Cousin Vail to tell him," interrupted Gerald.</p>
                  <p>"No, Gerald; we must tell him ourselves, I think," said Lucia, though her cheek
                     turned pale with apprehension as she uttered the words.</p>
                  <p>Lucia had an almost mortal terror of her father; she had hard work, when he
                     looked or spoke to her so coldly, to keep her lip from quivering, and great
                     tear-drops from falling. Any harshness of manner or loudness of sound was so
                     repulsive to her it hurt her.</p>
                  <p>As soon as there was action before him, Gerald became himself. He threw back
                     his head with a gesture very like Sir Hugh's.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, Lucy, if we have to do this, we had better get through with it.
                     Cousin Vail is in the library, and papa is in his office, and Mrs. Devere is
                     packing up to leave to-morrow. Come on."</p>
                  <p>Gerald sprung to his feet. He was a noble fellow! He felt that his sister had
                     pointed out the only honorable way out of the difficulty, and it was not in his
                     temperament to stand upon the doing of what had to be done. He gave his hand to
                     his sister, assisting her to rise from off the step, then walked on, rapidly
                     preceding her, into the library.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail put down his book, when Gerald and Lucia addressed him, both
                     ejaculating the words, "Cousin Vail," simultaneously.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail smiled benignantly.</p>
                  <p>"You must give the lady precedence, Gerald. What is it, Lucia?"</p>
                  <p>"But this is my business," interposed Gerald.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Lucia, laying her hand on his mouth, "it is <emph>my</emph>
                     business."</p>
                  <p>Then drawing near to Mr. Vail, she told her story. Mr. Vail's face grew very
                     grave, as the narration progressed. He knew better than the two young people
                     before him how serious this offence would be considered by Sir Hugh.</p>
                  <p>He sat meditating a few moments after Lucia had finished her account, his
                     benevolent blue eyes resting thoughtfully, and with a shade of care on the
                     youthful pair. At last, with a little sigh, taking out his pocket handkerchief,
                     and rubbing his spectacles, (always a symptom of discomposure with the good
                     man,) Mr. Vail looked up with a half-embarrassed, queer smile, saying:</p>
                  <p>"'Dent ocius omnes tuas meruere pati, pœnas.' Come, children, let us go to Sir
                     Hugh."</p>
                  <p>"Cousin Vail, it is not necessary for you to go," said Gerald, "nor Lucia. I am
                     going alone to papa."</p>
                  <p>"No!" exclaimed Lucia, clinging tightly to his arm. "No, Gerald, you shan't go
                     alone. I am as much in fault as you are."</p>
                  <p>"There is no fault about it," replied Gerald. "As far as we are concerned, I
                     would do it again. It is papa who is so unjust."</p>
                  <p>Shaking Lucia off his arm, he started for his father's office, walking with
                     rapid, resolute strides.</p>
                  <p>Lucia and Mr. Vail hastened after him as fast as they were able; but Gerald was
                     tall, made long steps, and got over ground quickly.</p>
                  <p>Gerald reached the door, pushed it open impatiently, which was a very great
                     offence in Sir Hugh's eyes. He was a very Ahasuerus, people who approached his
                     magisterial presence having to pass through the hands of as many lackeys, and
                     ante-chamber ushers, as if Sir Hugh had been a prince of the blood.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh looked up angrily, as the door opened so unceremoniously. His brow
                     cleared somewhat as he recognized his handsome son in the impetuous intruder.
                     It was not his way though, to overlook anything that he fancied showed a shade
                     of disrespect, or want of due propriety on anybody's part, towards his majestic
                     person. He checked the more amiable feeling, and spoke sternly:</p>
                  <p>"You intrude, Gerald; I am engaged at present, as you see, with Mr. Temple.
                     Lyndsay could have told you so, had you inquired in the ante-chamber."</p>
                  <p>"I did not speak to Lyndsay, papa; and it is precisely because Mr. Temple was
                     here that I came to you at this moment. I suppose, sir," continued Gerald,
                     turning to the Rev. Mr. Temple, Rector of the Parish, who lived in the larger
                     town of P——, some miles off from Hurst—a smooth, oily looking ing, meek man,
                     Mr. Temple was, in a long, black clerical habit—"I suppose, sir, you are
                     settling with papa about Mr. Devere?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Temple smiled urbanely.</p>
                  <p>"He was happy to say he had been able to oblige Sir Hugh in this matter, and
                     Hurst was now, or shortly would be, rid of the curate who, after all"—Mr.
                     Temple continued thoughtfully, as if soliloquizing—"did much harm among the
                     villagers, spending so much time as he did with the most disreputable and
                     poorest class, multiplying services, increasing ritual, putting notions of
                     strange interpretation into the heads of the congregation. Mr. Temple had been
                     dissatisfied for some time past with Mr. Devere's officiousness, keeping all
                     the obsolete festivals, fasts and octaves; he was really glad to get rid of the
                     fellow, and to oblige Sir Hugh"</p>
                  <p>Gerald regarded the Rev. Mr. Temple with an open expression of unfeigned
                     contempt as he spoke; then turning away, as if he was utterly unworthy of
                     notice from him, Gerald addressed his father. His voice was pleading and
                     affectionate.</p>
                  <p>"If you please, papa, listen to me for a moment before you decide upon removing
                     good Mr. Devere from a place where he is so much beloved and so useful to the
                     poor people. Papa, do not be angry—it was I who requested Mr. Devere to bury
                     John Dodd in the Hurst church-yard. I went to see John the day before he died.
                     He wished to be buried there—I promised he should be. I am alone to blame, if
                     there be any blame in this whole affair—I did it all. John was mamma's servant.
                     Let me ask it of your justice, which ought to belong to a Dare"—Gerald drew
                     himself up, and threw back his head in his haughty way—"Let me demand of you,
                     sir, to punish me with your displeasure, and not to visit it upon the innocent
                     Mr. Devere."</p>
                  <p>Lucia and Mr. Vail were by this time added to the excited group, and if
                     Asmodeus had been here, he could have also seen Lyndsay with his ear at the
                     key-hole of the door which led into the ante-chamber.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh did not notice the entrance of Lucia and Mr. Vail, even if he saw them
                     come into the room. He sat as if stunned in his magisterial chair on the dais,
                     looking at the unblenching form of his insubordinate son. Gerald's audacity had
                     actually appalled him.</p>
                  <p>The Rev. Mr. Temple sunk back in his chair completely overwhelmed, glancing
                     feebly and with looks of apprehension from father to son and son to father.</p>
                  <p>Gerald stood unmoved, drawn to his full height, with his arms folded. The eyes
                     of the father and son were fixed on each other. Gerald's face expressed sturdy
                     resolution, but no defiance. Sir Hugh's eyes beamed one steady glare of rage.
                     For at least a minute this dumbness lasted; then Sir Hugh's mouth moved—the
                     storm-cloud darkened on his brow—his voice was deep and hoarse, like the growl
                     of a lion.</p>
                  <p>"Boy! do you brave me? Do you think I will pardon insolence and insubordination
                     in you more than any other? Mr. Temple, Mr. Devere will leave this place
                     immediately—he dares abet my son in disobedience. And as for you, sir—you boy,
                     who talk of the justice and pride of the <emph>Dares to me!</emph> You, who by
                     your own confession sneak about the country plotting with menials and low
                     priests, to interfere with my orders and injure my reputation. As for you," Sir
                     Hugh seized his gold-hended cane in a paroxysm of passion; he made one stride
                     to his son's side—Gerald did not move: neither eye nor muscle wavered—Sir Hugh
                     hesitated—Gerald opened his lips, said softly, pleadingly, "Don't, papa! don't
                     strike, papa!" Again Sir Hugh lifted the cane—Mr. Temple ejaculated a
                     feeble—"For God's sake Sir Hugh!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail tried to catch Sir Hugh's arm in vain—the blow descended.</p>
                  <p>Lucia screamed, and springing forward, she threw her arms around Gerald, and
                     clung to his breast as if to shield him from the furious blows; but they came,
                     madly, revengefully—excited by his own act, Sir Hugh struck with all his
                     strength, once, twice, thrice, upon that proud head and shoulder—they fell with
                     fierce power and temper. There was a red weal on Gerald's handsome brow. Lucia
                     threw up her arm and caught the last violent blow on it. The slender arm
                     dropped helplessly; with a low cry of pain, Lucia slid from Gerald's arms on to
                     the floor. She had fainted—her arm was broken! Gerald lifted his sister from
                     the floor without a word or look towards his now exhausted father, and bore her
                     insensible out of the room.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail followed them, after casting a glance of anger and indignation on Sir
                     Hugh.</p>
                  <p>"Are you mad, Hugh Dare? Pray God to forgive you for this day's work!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Temple scrambled up out of his chair, mumbling he "would call another
                     day—at—at—Sir Hugh's convenience," and got himself out of the way.</p>
                  <p>The angry man was left alone: his stick lay broken on the floor. The sudden
                     silence was terrible. He looked around like one amazed—roused out of a trance.
                     He threw himself back in his magisterial chair and covered his face with his
                     hands. "He will never forgive it!—never—never—I have lost my son! My haughty,
                     handsome boy!"</p>
                  <p>No thought for the weak, suffering girl, whose delicate bone he had crushed
                     like a piece of frail porcelain: no, all his care was for Gerald, the secret
                     idol of his heart—now alienated from him for ever! Nothing could wipe out that
                     insult from the heart<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6308-00000013"/> of a boy of
                     sixteen, even if Sir Hugh could have humbled himself so far as to seek to do
                     it. His son's love, his respect forfeited, never to be regained—never! What was
                     left him? Sir Hugh groaned.</p>
                  <p>Lyndsay opened the door and entered with his usual noiseless step.</p>
                  <p>"Did you call, Sir Hugh?"</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh looked up fiercely.</p>
                  <p>"No, I did not call. Wait, sir, until you are summoned. I ring when I require
                     you! No—I did not call—but—" he hesitated—"Where is my son?"</p>
                  <p>Lyndsay answered in his dulcet way—</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Gerald is in Miss Dare's apartments. The housekeeper, and governess, and
                     Mr. Vail are also there. Dr. Mills, the apothecary in the village, has been
                     sent for—and also Mr. Vail has telegraphed to London for Sir Henry Halford.
                     Miss Dare is suffering greatly, and lies in a succession of fainting fits."</p>
                  <p>Lyndsay delivered this agreeable information in the coolest and most obliging,
                     suave manner.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh looked as if he would like to have annihilated his sleek valet on the
                     spot, but he only waved his hand—</p>
                  <p>"You may go."</p>
                  <p>Lyndsay slid out of the room, chuckling to himself—having shot his little
                     quiver of darts into Sir Hugh's aching heart, he was quite ready to leave the
                     presence.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE FLIGHT.</head>
                  <p>THE apothecary came, and the surgeon arrived. Lucia's arm was set. Sir Hugh
                     sent for the surgeon so soon as he quitted Miss Dare's apartments. The surgeon
                     declared "Miss Dare would do very well now."</p>
                  <p>"A fracture in so delicate a subject is, of course, very serious, on account of
                     nervousness, and risk of febrile irritation; but a free use of arnica will
                     bring the swelling down, and we will exhibit cooling medicines. At Miss Dare's
                     age, and a good constitution, though not at all robust, still sane and pure in
                     blood, I think we will soon be over it, and all right again. Thrown off a
                     horse, eh! Such accidents are frequent! Not? Something about a horse, or a
                     ride, I thought. No? Ah! Indeed? How then—eh?"</p>
                  <p>The surgeon brought his remarks to an untimely close, checked by a sudden gleam
                     from Sir Hugh's fiery eyes; at this unsatisfactory stage of the conversation,
                     after being liberally feed, he was coldly and politely dismissed by Sir
                     Hugh.</p>
                  <p>Lyndsay conducted him ceremoniously out of the office, his lips set in their
                     usual furtive smirk of satisfaction. When they were fairly out of Sir Hugh's
                     presence, in the ante-chamber, Lindsay's smirk developed into a broad grin; and
                     lowering his head, he indulged in low, chuckling laughter. The surgeon looked
                     surprised; but Lindsay beckoning to him to pause, went to a bureau, opened a
                     drawer, took out two broken pieces of cane, and nodding his head, showed them
                     to the surgeon, pointing with the sticks towards the office, in which Sir Hugh
                     was closeted; he whispered, "<emph>He did it</emph> with this 'ere!"</p>
                  <p>"Did what?" demanded the puzzled son of Æsculapius.</p>
                  <p>"Broke his daughter's arm, and thrashed his son like fury!"</p>
                  <p>"He did?" The surgeon put his hand up to his mouth with sly curiosity. "What
                     did he do it for?"</p>
                  <p>Lindsay, delighted with the opportunity, narrated the whole story with gusto
                     and animation.</p>
                  <p>The surgeon listened in amazement, ejaculating more than once, "What an old
                     devil it is!"</p>
                  <p>"You may well say that. Nobody knows that better than I. I have been livin'
                     with him now, for ten years; I never see such a temper as his'n. He's the
                     h'arbitrariest and the contrariest hindiwindual I ever did see! All them Dares
                     was, they say; but Gerald do seem to have better blood in him, an' Miss Dare do
                     seem soft and gentle as welwet linin' to a coat; but <emph>he's</emph> a w'ole
                        Saytin—<emph>he</emph> is! Only he pays well, and ain't mean about money,
                     an' a careful man can save a tidy bit in the service, though hard enuf I finds
                     it."</p>
                  <p>The surgeon went once more to visit his patient; then leaving directions with
                     the apothecary for her treatment he returned to London. Sir Henry Halford came
                     down, prescribed some anti-spasmodics, then he went back. As soon as Lucia grew
                     better, Sir Hugh went too. He had seen neither of his children since the fatal
                     day of passion. He wrote to Mr. Vail, to see that Lucia wanted for nothing;
                     then he quitted the Hurst. Parliament was in session—he was glad of the excuse
                     to get away.</p>
                  <p>Gerald scarcely ever left his sister's bedside. No woman could have been more
                     tender and considerate than he proved himself now. "Cousin Vail," Lucia
                     declared, "should have a surgeon's diploma, he was so skillful in placing and
                     displacing bandages.</p>
                  <p>Lucia made light of what she called "her accident." She would not let Gerald
                     see that she suffered; but Mr. Vail, more experienced, read beneath the thin
                     veil of smiles, the hectic flush of fever; and he saw when the pain was often
                     almost too acute to be borne in silence. Then he would manage to get Gerald out
                     of the room, and leave Lucia to suffer without constraint. The pain often made
                     her weep, she was such a soft little thing; but no one ever saw her tears, or
                     heard her complain. One day she whispered to Mr. Vail "to be sure to send her
                     love to papa, and to tell him she was nearly well, she knew he didn't mean to
                     hurt her." Mr. Vail wrote the message, with a page of addition of his own,
                     which did not make Sir Hugh feel any the more comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Gerald seemed much changed. He never alluded to the scene in the library. He
                     appeared to have made a sudden leap from the frolic lightheartedness of
                     boyhood, into the sedate gravity of a man. He rarely smiled now; never, except
                     for Lucia. He devoted himself to her; he abandoned the society of the
                     gamekeepers; the hunt had no attractions for him; he haunted his sister's
                     apartments; he never wearied in trying to amuse her, and to wile away the long,
                     tedious hours of pain. He would bring her flowers, and books, and pictures;
                     would sit by her with his arm tenderly thrown over her—hours at a time—talking
                     to her. He would take "her well hand" into his, and press it again and again to
                     his lips and brow. He was everything that was good, thoughtful, and loving to
                     Lucia—but not the same Gerald. He was colder and more haughty towards the
                     servants, and others before whom he felt he had been humiliated; he barely
                     recognized Mr. Temple, when he met him accidentally; he never mentioned his
                     father to any one; he wore his hair lower on his brow than he formerly
                     did—there was a slight scar to conceal—a scar that remained through life, but
                     that was nothing to the internal wound—nothing.</p>
                  <p>Gerald looked grave, firm, and resolved, like a man who had passed a crisis in
                     his life; the bright, glad boy was gone—for ever. Lucia could not make him out;
                     she could not induce him to tell her his thoughts. He would parry her anxious
                     questionings, both of word and look, either shutting her mouth with kisses, or
                     making some playful reply, assuring her that nothing troubled him but her
                     indisposition. Days passed fleetly into weeks, and weeks into months. Sir Hugh
                     was still in London. Lucia was able to ride out now in an easy carriage, and to
                     lie on the couch in the library, so "Cousin Vail" could return to his beloved
                     books; she could even use her arm gently, in woman's fine work, which she
                     hastened to do as soon as she could, in order to relieve all who loved her,
                     from care about her.</p>
                  <p>Cousin Vail had secured a good living for Mr. Devere—better than that of the
                     curacy of Hurst. Mr. Devere liked the new location.</p>
                  <p>Gerald's mind was greatly relieved by this. Lucia gave "Cousin Vail" such a
                     kiss of love and thankfulness! She hoped now, that Gerald's face would clear
                     up, and the old sunshine would come back—but not yet—not yet! Sweet Lucy did
                     not know that there were Rubicons in life that could never be recrossed, even
                     by Cæsars.</p>
                  <p>One day Gerald was sitting by Lucia, reading aloud a book he particularly
                     liked. It was Scott's "Peveril of the Peak." He laid the book down, and taking
                     hold of one of Lucia's long, brown curls, said:</p>
                  <p>"Little woman, you have most as much hair as Fenella. This is a lovely long
                     curl. I am going to cut it off."</p>
                  <p>Lucia smiled at her brother's fond humor. Gerald drew his knife out of his
                     pocket, cut off the bright lock, wrapped it up carefully, in a piece of
                     paper,—taking a bit of blue riband out of her work-basket to tie it up. "Now,
                     that is a true-love knot," he said, holding up the little packet after it was
                     arranged to his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"Margery will scold when she sees the mischief you have done, and the havoc you
                     have made in my curls, which are the joy and pride of her life," laughed Lucia,
                     seizing the jagged end of her tress and tucking it back under the other
                     curls.</p>
                  <p>"And you are the joy and pride of mine, little woman." Gerald bent over, kissed
                     her, picked up the book and continued his reading. How well Lucia remembered
                     all the incidents of this day afterwards! How many hours she spent in recalling
                     every look, every word, every movement of Gerald's!</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh notified his steward of his anticipated return on the day following.
                     Already a shadow of gloom and anxiety overspread the little group in the
                     library—the herald of Sir Hugh's advent. Sir Hugh had corresponded daily with
                     his steward, and by his orders, the apothecary had forwarded continual reports
                     of Lucia's health and convalescence. His children, however, were ignorant of
                     this latter circumstance. He had never addressed line or message to either of
                     them since the unfortunate day of mad temper. Lucia observed that Gerald was
                     unusually affectionate in his "good night" on this occasion. He came back after
                     embracing her more warmly than usual, and kissed her passionately again and
                     again. "Dear, dear little woman, you are so good and so precious," he said, as
                     he passed the library: seeing from the lights burning, that Mr. Vail was still
                     there reading, he went in—standing by him, making some jesting remark in regard
                     to his great assiduity, Gerald put his arm around the old man's shoulder, but
                     Mr. Vail remembered this only long, long afterwards with tears in his aged
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Why, who is this you have hidden here under the pages of your book! A
                     miniature! Why, Cousin Vail, who would have suspected <emph>you</emph> of such
                     a tender weakness!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, dear Gerald, all men nearly have<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6308-00000014"/>
                     a heart-story,—even when one is as unattractive as I am, and always was, I
                     believe. I was never a gallant, always a student of books, shrinking from the
                     world, but I loved this woman with all the strength of my soul." Mr. Vail drew
                     out the miniature and handed it to Gerald. It was a pretty old-fashioned
                     picture of Lady Sybilla in her earliest youth; making allowances for difference
                     in dress and coiffure, it would have passed as a good likeness of Lucia. Gerald
                     looked at it reverently. Mr. Vail continued—"I like this better than the
                     portraits Sir Hugh had painted of Sybilla. She had it taken and gave it to me
                     before her marriage. I took it out to give to Lucia."</p>
                  <p>"Give it to me, Cousin Vail! Do give it to me!" said Gerald eagerly.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Vail looked at him, surprised at his earnestness. "Well, if you want it so
                     much, Gerald, I know Lucy would rather you had it, so take it, my boy."</p>
                  <p>Gerald threw his arms around Mr. Vail's neck, kissed his cheek, and quitted the
                     room, carrying off his picture.</p>
                  <p>The next morning Gerald Dare was not to be found at the Hurst. Sir Hugh was
                     telegraphed to, search made in every direction, the police were employed,
                     detectives paid enormously—British consuls written to in all parts of the
                     world—Gerald Dare was never heard of. He was traced, traveling with Jim Dodd,
                     to Liverpool, where he lodged in a common sailor's tavern, under the fanciful
                     name of "Edward Montague." After this, enquiry broke down. Nothing more could
                     be ascertained. Sir Hugh lavished money in bribes and advertisements in every
                     quarter of the world to no purpose. Sir Hugh sent Lucia to Paris, placing her
                     in a celebrated boarding school. Mr. Vail took her over—Lucia's presence was
                     painful to Sir Hugh. Mr. Vail went regularly every three months to see after
                     his darling so long as her father kept her there. It was a great effort for the
                     shy scholar who began to feel the infirmities of his age creeping over him.
                     Year after year glided on, and still in the magisterial chamber walked many and
                     many an hour, the form, once so proud and stately, of the Baron of Hurst, now
                     bent with grief, who so often extended his arms longingly, wildly, and so
                     vainly, as he would cry in his anguish, "Gerald! my son! oh, my son! come back,
                     come back, and forgive your wretched father!" Lyndsay would smile and rub his
                     hands softly when he heard this cry, sometimes in the dead of night, from the
                     lips of the bereaved father. Lyndsay lay in Sir Hugh's ante-chamber always.
                     Every groan of anguish from the proud lips of his master was a cruel joy to
                     Lyndsay. Gerald never came back. The waves of the ocean beat on between the
                     divided father and son, answering, it seemed ever to him, the cry of Sir Hugh's
                     despairing soul, with the sad, sad, bitter refrain, "<emph>never more, never
                        more!</emph>"</p>

                  <p>DEAR COUSIN VAIL:—You must not fret too much about me, nor imagine I am so very
                     unhappy here. I fear even your dear Greek Elzevirs gives you but little
                     satisfaction, from the tone of your last letters. But, Cousin Vail, indeed I
                     believe I am better here than at the dear, dear old Hurst! Everything is so
                     strange and novel, and even the effort to talk in this foreign language, I have
                     no doubt, is good for me. I think it was very right and kind in papa to send me
                     quite away. Oh! Cousin Vail, I have such a foolish, wild hope of seeing or
                     hearing of my darling, precious Gerald! I was glad to get away from the Hurst,
                     where I knew I could hear nothing of him, out into the world anywhere—this
                     great, wide, vast world, where my Gerald is hidden from me somewhere. It is so
                     strange, Cousin Vail, that any one so near and so dear can be taken away so
                     utterly, so entirely out of our lives—just by one act, one hour, one minute,
                     can rob us of all the joy of life: can destroy the association, the blessed
                     companionship of years, and leave one so desolate, so lonely! Oh! my Gerald, my
                     darling, the silence as if of the grave has come between us; and yet I know, I
                     feel, you are not dead. God has not taken you away from your poor—poor sister!
                     Cousin Vail, how strange it is that our hearts can't tell us instinctively
                     where anything we love so much is hidden. I will find my brother, I know I
                     will; I must, I must; he could, could not leave me so, forever. It would be so
                     cruel, so unlike Gerald. Cousin Vail, I am a silly little thing. Do you know I
                     never go out to walk with the teachers, nor to shop on the Boulevards, as I
                     sometimes am allowed to do, with Madame Bernard, that I am not looking into
                     every face that reminds me of my brother! I must tell you all my foolishness.
                     You always have patience with me. The other day we were out walking, Madame and
                     I, and I saw a gentleman, a young man about Gerald's height, with the same
                     colored hair and eyes, turn a corner, walking rapidly in front of us. Madame
                     Bernard was very angry, and scolded me, because I dropped her arm and ran after
                     him. I know how dreadfully improper it was, but I could not help doing it,
                     Cousin Vail. The gentleman had stepped into an optician's, on the Rue de la
                     Paix; he came out, holding a lorquette in his hand. There I stood at the door,
                     looking like a very weak, silly child, I have no doubt, staring at him, for,
                     when he came out of the shop, he saw me standing, and met my eyes fixed full
                     upon him, I suppose, with an eager gaze. He stopped short, and said in English,
                     but not with English voice or accent:</p>
                  <p>"Can I aid you in any way, young lady?"</p>
                  <p>I put my hands up to my eyes, and burst into tears, which made matters worse. I
                     could not speak, I was so disappointed. He stood looking at me in surprise.
                     Such ridiculous conduct on my part! I am so ashamed of it.</p>
                  <p>Madame came up panting, she seized my arm, shook it angrily, saying:</p>
                  <p>"Ah! que tu es folle! Qu' est ce que vous voulez faire à présent, mademoiselle?
                     quelle autre bêtise?"</p>
                  <p>I did not care; I was too unhappy. I wept so, she had to call a fiacre, and
                     take me home. I heard her say something, apologetic, to the young gentleman,
                     telling him I was "Anglaise toute pleine des caprices;" that I was searching,
                     "toujours," for a brother, "un fils, un enfant prodigue qui avait disparn."</p>
                  <p>The gentleman requested permission to call a fiacre for her, and assisted us to
                     enter it. Madame Bernard gave the address of her pension. Immediately he handed
                     her his card. Apparently it was some name she knew, for, as soon as she glanced
                     at it, her face cleared up.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, bien!" she said, nodding her head. But she continued to scold me as fast
                     as her French tongue could move.</p>
                  <p>I was too miserable to care much. You know, Cousin Vail, how those terrible
                     fits of weeping exhaust me, and my head ached so I hardly heard anything she
                     said, only the buzz of something dinning into my ears. I suppose I looked very
                     woe-begone, for she suddenly changed her tone, and instead of scolding began to
                     caress me, saying:</p>
                  <p>"Petite, pauvre petite fille! As soon as we arrive, you sail haf une tasse de
                     thé. C'est toujours bonne pour la santé Anglaise! n'est ce pas mignonne?"</p>
                  <p>When we reached the pension, she half carried me into her salon. She removed my
                     hat with her own hands, made me lie down on her softest sofa, and brought me a
                     cup of tea. It was not very good tea, (these French people don't know how to
                     make a respectable cup of tea,) but it was hot, and it did make me feel better.
                     The change in my appearance, I suppose, confirmed Madame in her idea of the
                     benefit English constitutions derive from tea, for, since then, every day, at
                     noon, the bonne brings me a cup of weak tea and a small biscuit. The girls
                     laugh at me; but I am very glad of the pleasant, home like beverage. So I am
                     truly grateful to Madame.</p>
                  <p>I don't like the black coffee here; but Madame and Louise Peyrault drink it
                     half-a dozen times a day, I believe, in tiny cups, scarcely bigger than
                     thimbles. This girl, Louise Peyrault, I like very much. The girls call her,
                     "L'Etoile du Sud," her name is, "Louise Estelle Marie Vierge Peyrault." She is
                     an American, from the Southern United States.</p>
                  <p>We have girls here from nearly all parts of the world. We are allowed to see
                     each other, for about two hours, in the middle of the day, and again we are
                     permitted to remain for a short time, at night, in the classe, after the
                     lecture is ended. We sew, and talk, under the surveillance of the
                     under-teachers. Sometimes one of the girls, generally Louise, plays on the
                     piano-forte, and the rest of us dance. It is a strange, new life, Cousin Vail,
                     mingling with so many girls. At first I felt very shy; indeed I was frightened,
                     for some of these demoiselles are very rude. But this tall creole, Louise, took
                     me under her wing, and I get along better now. The girls adore Louise. This
                     creole—I did not like to say so—but when she called herself so, I looked at her
                     with curiosity, for, though her skin is not fair, it is white like cream;
                     certainly no black about her, except in her flashing eyes, and clouds of hair,
                     black as ebony, blue-black, without a wave in it. This creole laughed—you ought
                     to have heard her merry, scornful laugh—when she made out from my confused,
                     embarrassed questions, that I supposed she had African blood in her veins. She
                     took my hand, and laid it on her own long, slender, taper fingers.</p>
                  <p>"Look, you silly little English girl, my nails are as pink, though my skin is
                     not so white, as yours. The blood in my veins, child, is as pure and good as
                     any Dare's. I have the sangre azul of Castillian dukes and French princes to
                     warm my heart! A creole is not a quadroon. How ignorant all of you English are
                     about us?"</p>
                  <p>"But, my dear Louise, you must not rate the knowledge of the rest of the
                     English by mine; you know I am only an ignorant little girl, brought up in a
                     very retired corner of dear old England, with a governess and"—I broke down—I
                     always do break down about Gerald. So I began to cry as usual.</p>
                  <p>Louise put her arm around me: "Don't cry, dear; you'll find him some day. I'll
                     help you to look for him.—There!" and she kissed me just as if I was a baby. I
                     feel very often like one amongst these wild, impetuous girls.</p>
                  <p>There is something very winning and soothing about Louise's careless,
                     half-haughty, indolent Southern manners. She is so graceful, and so true, she
                     detests falsity, and denounces it instantly wherever she finds it. There is
                     fire enough, and there<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6308-00000015"/> are lightnings
                     too, of temper and passion in her. The quick, vivid flame darts out in an
                     instant, scorching—blasting—sarcasm. Wit—keen, polished, and deadly, flashes
                     out with deathful force, at any meanness or in-sincerity. But she is merry and
                     truly good-natured, and moves about among the rest of us, like "a high and
                     mighty well-born princess." Herr Gottfried, the German master says—old Herr
                     Gottfried has a great admiration for the proud Southerner. He is sixty years
                     old; he writes poetry about Louise, calls her Chriemhilde, and all sorts of
                     heroic names.</p>
                  <p>Louisa is about seventeen; but she looks much older. It is her last year at
                     Madame Bernard's. She is thoroughly high-bred, with all that <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">je'ne scais quoi</foreign> that marks a lady; but simple and
                     easy as a child—sometimes showing a slight imperiousness, as if she had been
                     accustomed to command. I suppose she acquired <emph>that</emph> from being
                     surrounded by slaves all her life. I said so to her one day. She smiled:
                     "That's another of your English prejudices! I have no doubt I talk and
                     associate more frankly with my father's slaves than you ever did with your
                     father's tenants. The barrier of race is so strong with us, that we can
                     condescend safely, you can't. My dear, our system of labor is older, more
                     natural, and more religious than yours. Ours is patriarchal, yours was feudal;
                     and now your tenants are governed by necessity. Ours was made by God himself,
                     yours by man."</p>
                  <p>Of course, Cousin Vail, we have frequent if not very satisfactory, and
                     interesting if not very wise, discussions on all these topics. Louise is so
                     intelligent and so well posted in the history and peculiarities of her own
                     country and people—I didn't know they had any history, but they have. How
                     Louise does love her country! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon pays des Lis ma
                        Louisiane,</foreign>" she calls it. Her great eyes sparkle and flash, and
                     her rich, sleepy voice grows tender and sweet when she speaks of her home. But
                     it is only the South she loves, not the whole United States. There is another
                     Americaine here—a beautiful, blue-eyed creature; the prettiest thing I ever
                     saw; with hair like dead gold, and skin, not creamy like a lily's, but fine and
                     transparent like a white flag leaf. She comes from Massachusetts, I think; her
                     name is Grace Sharp. Louise don't like her. There seems to be guerre a
                     l'outrance between them. I feel sorry for Grace, sometimes. Louise never loses
                     an opportunity of casting the sharp javelin of her wit at her, and I have seen
                     Grace look at Louise with a dull, torpid hatred, that made me shudder. I asked
                     Louise one day why she didn't like Grace better than she seemed to—both being
                     American.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Louise, leaning back in the chaise longue in a graceful position
                     of perfect repose, her long hands folded in absolute quiet, though they never
                     stay quiet long—they soon spring out in charming gesticulation when she's
                     animated: "Well," in a half-dreamy, indolent voice, "I'll tell you—according to
                     the children's play: I dislike her with an A; because she's artful, ambitions,
                     and an abolitionist. I like her with a B; because she is beautiful. Dislike her
                     with a C; because she is cold and cunning. With a D; because she is deceitful.
                     With an F; because she is fidgety, fawning, and flattering. So I could go
                     through the whole alphabet; but I'll cut it short, for your sake, Lucia. She is
                     a cool, cultivated, smart, acute, intelligent, ill-tempered, malicious Yankee.
                     She is manœuvring, and bites her finger-nails; she rolls up her eyes (though
                     they are pretty), and looks languishing. She ought to wear sevens in Jouvin's
                     gloves, and she will buy sixes, which make her hands fat and puffy-looking. She
                     should wear fours in slippers, but tries to squeeze her toes in threes. She
                     ought to wear nothing but blues or pea-greens, or soft lilacs, with her skin of
                     snow, and she makes a horror of herself in <emph>my</emph> colors—crimson and
                     orange. She has no taste, nor tact, nor breeding." Louise's low, ringing laugh
                     sounded like a silver chime, as she concluded her whimsical description. "So
                     you see, I don't like her morals, her taste, her birth, nor her dress. She does
                     not suit me."</p>
                  <p>"And Belle etoile," said I, laughing back. "Do you want me to attempt an
                     alphabetical catalogue of <emph>your</emph> advantages and disadvantages?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, do, Lucy, begin; I am all attention."</p>
                  <p>She stretched out her exquisite little feet lazily on the fautenil.</p>
                  <p>She wears two's and a half, Cousin Vail, in slippers. I never did see such
                     careless grace in any body. She is lithe and supple as a willow-wand—five feet,
                     six inches tall, too!</p>
                  <p>"Well, I love my love with an A, because she is really amiable, though
                     sometimes she does not seem so. I dislike her with an A, because she is
                     arrogant—like her with a B, she is brave et "bien belle," but she is
                     bantering—like her with a D, she is devoted and devout; but then she is
                     disdainful and defiant. We will skip over the F, though I think her both fair
                     and fanciful, graceful and gracious, handsome and haughty, innocent,
                     impassioned, <emph>not</emph> often ill-tempered, altogether a proud,
                     sensitive, ambitious, warm, impatient, indolent, well-bred, courteous,
                     whimsical, dazzling Southern Queen, who uses her very pretty long hands as if
                     they had never held any thing but a sceptre, and had nothing more useful to do
                     in this world but play with that rustling Spanish fan, and look white!"</p>
                  <p>"You think so! you think so! Lucia Dare—bah! I have sat by my old black mammy's
                     sick bed many a night and bathed her poor old aching head with eau-de-cologne.
                     You proud English girl would not like to touch an old negress with the tips of
                     your fingers; neither would Grace Sharp, with her pink, fretful, bitten hands,
                     though neither of you think we Southern slave owners are as good as Pagans, or
                     fit to touch the borders of your broad phylacteries, you Pharisees of the
                     world! Heretics that you are! My mammy took care of me ever after my poor
                     mother died, and I love her."</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>It was a kindly thought in you, Cousin Vail, to make me promise to write to you
                     in this rambling style, instead of requiring regular letters. I find it
                     delightful to sit down every night and write a few lines, thus keeping you an
                     courant to the small events of my day, and enjoying the satisfaction and relief
                     of pouring out all my fantastic and crude thoughts into your sympathizing ear.
                     You have always been so good to me, dear Cousin Vail, you will not neglect to
                     fulfill the promise you made me to look after Lizzie Green, the miner's
                     daughter at Goodall's—will you? I think there is much good to be developed in
                     that poor girl—she seemed so grateful for the slight kindness I was able to
                     show her; and she is associated in my mind with the last ride I took with my
                     poor Gerald. You know she came to see me just before I quitted the Hurst. Poor
                     girl—she was so much improved in appearance and dress since I first met her!
                     But her eyes were red with weeping, she seemed so distressed about me. You
                     know, Cousin Vail, I <emph>did</emph> look very pale, and badly, after that
                     severe attack of fever I had after my darling went away. I thought poor Lizzy
                     seemed to have deeper care than even her sympathy and compassion for me
                     justified. Her red cheeks paled, and her black eyes filled up with tears when
                     she spoke of Jim Dodd's going off to America. Oh, Cousin Vail, if we could only
                     find out whether they <emph>did</emph> go to America, and to which part of it!
                     I think it would be well to see if Margery would not allow Lizzie Green to come
                     and live with her. Lizzie dislikes the mines, and Margery <emph>must</emph> be
                     lonesome living down in that little cottage by the brook, so far from every
                     body. Margery is old, and has been so devoted to me all my life; please see
                     that she lacks nothing that can add to her comfort. If she would take Lizzie,
                     she might teach her to be a lady's maid, and perhaps when I return she might
                     answer as my attendant. Lizzie is bright, I think. I send a nice pair of gold
                     spectacles, with glasses of pebble, for Margery. I got them from the optician
                     in the Rue de la Paix, who makes the famous Duchesse lorgnettes. I hope these
                     will suit Margery's eyes better than ordinary ones. Margery loves to read her
                     Bible and Prayer book, I know.</p>
                  <p>You ought to see a daguerreotype Louise has shown me of her
                        "<emph>mammy,</emph>" an old negress, black as ebony, full of wrinkles, with
                     a brilliant red and yellow turban (Louise calls it "head handkerchief,") on her
                     grey woolly head; a gown of blue and white check cotton, a large white apron,
                     huge gold earrings, and rings on every finger of both hands. Louise says,
                     "Mammy wanted to put on her Sunday silk gown, but I would not let her; I wanted
                     her picture as she appeared every day."</p>
                  <p>The old woman is evidently much delighted in sitting for her picture; she has a
                     good-natured animal expression in her smiling, queer black face. Louise seems
                     to look at it with great satisfaction and affection; but I confess I should not
                     like to have those skinny-be-ringed black claws to dress me! Louise is a study
                     to me, Cousin Vail. I must not weary you, writing about her, though. I wish you
                     knew her—then you would understand her charm for me and for every body.</p>
                  <p>Madame Bernard has just come in to say that she intends taking Louise and
                     myself to the opera to-night to hear Carvalho Grace Sharp has been sent for to
                     see some acquaintances at the Hotel du Louvre. She is to spend several days
                     with them people from America. I must make a toilette—Louise has just brought
                     me a handful of lovely Malmaison roses.</p>
                  <p>"You must wear them in your hair and corsage to-night, Lucia."</p>
                  <p>"And what are you going to wear, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"I—tamarisk blossoms, of course I red—red, or yellow always for me, Lucia."</p>
                  <p>Louise has exquisite taste in every thing, especially in dress.</p>
                  <p>Good-bye, dear Cousin Vail—my duty to papa.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LUCIA'S DIARY.</head>
                  <p>IT has seemed to me, recently, that it would be a comfort to me to keep a Diary
                     for myself. Writing to Cousin Vail every day, suggested this idea to me. So
                     now, little book, I intend to make a confidential friend of you. If I grow
                     dissatisfied with you, I can just put you into the fire and burn you up, as
                     Torquemada used to do "leshereticos"—appropos of heresy—Louise is a devoted
                     Romanist herself—though liberal towards others. The other day I was quite
                     sick—she brought in my room a small brass crucifix, and hung it<pb n="30-31"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000016"/> up at the foot of my bed. "It can do you no
                     harm, dear Lucia," she said, kissing me, "and I like to have it there." So I
                     allowed it to stay. Last evening Madame took us to the opera—Herr Gottfried was
                     our escort—the old German master. Carvalho sung in Le Pardon de Ploermel—how
                     lovely that shadow song is! The house was very crowded. Louise and I sat in the
                     front seats of the loge, Madame and Herr Gottfried behind us—Madame is very
                     kind to us both. Louise seems to have plenty of money; Madame says her father
                     is a person of distinction in Louisiana. She and I and Grace Sharp are the only
                     parlor-boarders here, so we are allowed much privilege. Grace has gone to-day
                     to visit some friends, who have just come from America. She is certainly very
                     pretty; but Louise is really prejudiced against anything that is born or comes
                     from the New England States. I had no idea that there was such a state of
                     feeling between the North and South in America; it reminds me of the old border
                     feeling between the Scotch and English. Louise grows eloquent on this theme;
                     she descants on the wrongs of her people with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes;
                     she says, "They—what she calls '<emph>Yankees</emph>'—the abolitionists, abuse
                     and villify us slave owners in their pulpits, their rostrums, their books—the
                     whole Yankee people are insane on the subject of slavery; and you English are
                     not much better, Lucia! It was you and the sons of those terrible bores, the
                     Puritan Pilgrim Fathers, that forced slaves on my ancestors. You made us take
                     them, then, because it was profitable to you; and now that we have made those
                     barbarians you poured into our feeble eclonies, civilized, useful Christian
                     laborers, you come and taunt us with the institutions of your own planting. You
                     would rob us, crush us, annihilate us, stir up insurrection and revolt, and
                     make us the very Pariahs of the human race! No, Lucia Dare, I don't like
                     Yankees nor English either, so much, for that matter!"</p>
                  <p>"But you like me, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes," embracing me with impetuosity. Surely she is a kin to the
                     Salamander, she is so fugose at times. "Yes, I love you, gentle gazelled-eyed
                     Lucia! If I had the genius of your Tennyson I would write you a poem, rivaling
                     'Rare, Pale Margaret;' but I have no love for your people, who have been ever
                     the secret, bitter enemies of mine; encore I am a Catholic, and par consequence
                     could not sympathize with Protestants nor Puritans, as a general thing!"</p>
                  <p>I wonder if this feeling of Louise's is common with her people, as she calls
                     them; if so, America is not the united, homogeneous Utopia I had conceived it
                     to be. If Louise was a man she would be very easily excited to a combat a
                     l'outrance, with any "Yankee!" What a pretty Britomart or Clorinda she would
                     make! She don't like it much here—this school-life wearies her, it is too
                     confined.</p>
                  <p>She moans sometimes for a ride on her favorite horse on the smooth level roads
                     of Louisiana. And I!—ah—"That way madness lies!" My Gerald! Oh! my Gerald!
                     shall I never, never see you again? I cannot think of riding on horseback
                     without recalling you, my precious, precious brother! Where is my pen straying
                     to? It does not matter, though; I will write whatever the chain of thought
                     prompts, without thinking of order, sequence, or rules of composition. No other
                     eye will rest on these pages, save my own. Louise whispered to me, after we
                     were all fairly settled in our seats at the opera, that she recognized a number
                     of Americans in the house. Paris is full of them just now; the Italian war
                     being ended so gloriously for France, the whole world seems desirous to come
                     here and offer homage to this greatest Napoleon. There was a grand triumphal
                     entry of the Army of Italy last Sunday. These strangers flocked here to see it,
                     I suppose. I did not see it, but Louise went with Madame and witnessed it from
                     a window on the Italian Boulevard. Louise says it was very grand and imposing.
                     All the Marshals of France were present; the Emperor at the head of the troops.
                     Louise says she never expects to have again the opportunity of seeing such a
                     display "of the grandeurs of war." "You know we republicans don't like to make
                     wars, as you monarchial people do in this hemisphere! It is not our interest to
                     fight!" She laughs at my way of spending Sundays; she thinks it is very
                        "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">triste.</foreign>" "Your own Charles I. and Laud
                     did not like Puritan Sundays!" This girl is a perpetual source of interest to
                     me, so different from any body I ever knew.</p>
                  <p>Presently Louise seized my arm. "Ciel! Lucia! there's my cousin, Reginald
                     Laurie." Louise was in a tremor of joy and excitement. "I wonder when he
                     arrived? He was in Rome last week, at least I had a letter from Switzerland
                     saying he was going there with some friends."</p>
                  <p>"Where, Louise, is he? In which loge?"</p>
                  <p>"Over there, nearly opposite, next the American Ambassador's box. See! he is
                     bending forward now to speak to a lady in front of him. Pshaw! it is Grace
                     Sharp! Don't you see her, Lucia?"</p>
                  <p>I directed my lorgnette to the spot indicated by Louise, and found Grace Sharp,
                     radiantly beautiful, in spite of the pale pink roses in her dead gold hair
                     (that girl has no sense of color at all). Grace was evidently engaged in what
                     girls call "a violent flirtation" with the handsome young American. He lifted
                     his head. Heavens! it was the very young man whom I mistook for Gerald. There
                     is a strong resemblance. My lorgnette trembled so at the remembrance, I had to
                     lower it."</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter, Lucia? Why do you tremble and turn so pale?" asked Louise,
                     anxiously.</p>
                  <p>I had told Louise the story of my foolish weakness in racing after the
                     gentleman, so she understood immediately when I said:</p>
                  <p>"It is the gentleman so like my brother, Louise!"</p>
                  <p>"Who, Redgie!" Louise exclaimed, with uplifted hand.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, if that gentleman is 'Redgie.'"</p>
                  <p>"Well, c'èst inconceivable!" When Louise is excited she talks French, her
                     native tongue. "Redgie is considered very good looking. Is your brother as
                     handsome as he?"</p>
                  <p>"I think Gerald handsomer, if there is any difference; but the likeness is not
                     so strong, when you observe not. What was the name, Louise, you said just
                     now?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Laurie—Reginald Laurie."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Laurie, more closely—he is taller and much older than Gerald. Are his eyes
                     black?"</p>
                  <p>"No—dark violet blue; they look black in certain lights. His hair and moustache
                     are black enough."</p>
                  <p>"He certainly is exceedingly handsome—distinguished looking," I observed.</p>
                  <p>"He seems quite comfortable over there with Grace Sharp," said Louise,
                     scornfully.</p>
                  <p>"He does not share your general and particular antipathy to Yankees,
                     Louise!"</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! Redgie always would flirt—all men like it. I never said Grace wasn't
                     pretty."</p>
                  <p>"No, she is really very beautiful, and looks unusually well to-night."</p>
                  <p>"What is your cousin doing here, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"His ostensible purpose is to study law, but I think Mr. Reginald is having
                     generally what is called a good time in this pleasure-facilitating city of
                     Paris. I wonder how he would like to be shut up in a school-room as I am
                     three-fourths of the day! I wonder if Madame will let me beckon Redgie
                     here—when I catch his eye, which I will be sure to do very soon."</p>
                  <p>"You had better ask her."</p>
                  <p>Louise did so. "Votre cousin, Laissez moi voir," said Madame, as Louise
                     proffered her request—directing her glass towards Mr. Laurie: "Ah! le jeune
                     homme qui"—Madame did not finish her sentence, but said meaningly, "My dear
                     Lucie mos not weep, however, if he sail come you, to speak."</p>
                  <p>[Madame is fond of speaking English.]</p>
                  <p>"Ah! no, Madame;" I replied, eagerly. "It was very foolish in me. I am quite
                     mortified about it; it was only the—the—disappointment." I felt a ball rising
                     in my throat now; but I choked it down, I could not bear to have Louise
                     refused. Madame accorded permission. Just then Grace Sharp recognized us.
                     Apparently, she said something to her companion, who turned his lorgnette upon
                     our loge. Instantly he lowered it, with a smile and bow to Louise, who, lifting
                     her Spanish fan, gave a peculiar whirl to it, throwing it out and closing it
                     rapidly. Again he bowed—lifting his hand to his lips, he made a rapid motion
                     with his fingers—said a few words to Grace, and quitted her box. In a few
                     minutes we heard his knock at our loge door. Herr Gottfried opened it, and Mr.
                     Laurie was greeting and being greeted by his cousin very affectionately. Louise
                     presented him to Madame and Herr Gottfried; of course they did not introduce
                     him to me. Madame did not, and Louise was afraid to. I was glad of it, because
                     I was ashamed of my silly behavior, when I first met him; I tried to shield my
                     face with my fan and bouquet, for I felt my cheeks burning as red as Louise's
                     tamarisk blossoms. Louise gave her seat by my side to Herr Gottfried; she went
                     farther back in the loge to talk with her cousin—one could barely hear the
                     sound of their low voices—there is great attraction in some voices. This
                     gentleman has a deep, rich, mellow voice. The timbre is fine. Herr Gottfried
                     chatted on like a Dutch parrot. Madame screamed like a French one; but through
                     all, I would hear like a full, deep, soft organ tone, the occasional sound of
                     Mr. Laurie's voice, as he talked with Louise, something of the same
                     half-indolent dreamy drawl of Louise's tongue, but fuller and richer. Their
                     voices are surely pitched a half octave lower than those of these people or of
                     Grace Sharp's. Mr. Laurie remained some time with Louise, then returned to his
                     own box—bidding Madame, Herr Gottfried, Louise, all "au re-voir," bowing low,
                     without speaking to me. I caught his eye, as he bent his head, and I saw a
                     smile in it. I know I grew redder. Louise came back to her seat.</p>
                  <p>"Lucia," whispered Louise, "Redgie asked a thousand and one questions about
                     you. He was quite interested about your brother. I told him of him—says he
                     would like to help you if he can; and is very flattered at your mistake. I told
                     him you said 'Gerald was much handsomer than he, when you came to examine
                     them.' It made him bite his lip. Redgie knows he is good-looking—all the girls
                     tell him that! You see it spoils a man so. Redgie is a good fellow though in
                     some respects. He gives me such good news from home. My father will be over
                     soon, and Philip—oh! Lucia! Philip! <emph>my</emph> Philip! is coming too!"</p>
                  <p>"Who is Philip, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>Louise flashed her brilliant joy-beaming eyes in mine—"Philip is Philip
                     Branger—and my fiance."</p>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6308-00000017"/>
                  <p>"Your <emph>what,</emph> Louise?" exclaimed I, astonished.</p>
                  <p>"My betrothed, Lucia, the man I am to marry, whom I love de tout mon
                     cœur—better than life, stronger than death! He and Redgie are great friends.
                     Ah!" continued Louise smiling, "you need not look so surprised, Lucia! It is
                     all on régle—papa approves. It is a family arrangement—everybody is
                     pleased—Philip and I most of all. We intended to marry since we were little
                     children. Madame knows all about it, else she would not have suffered me to
                     call a strange young man like Redgie to her box. Governesses usually have
                     little confidence in <emph>cousins;</emph> but Madame knows that I am already
                     engaged, and that I wouldn't give my Philip's little finger for this opera
                     house full of the handsomest men that breathe. Philip is not so handsome as
                     Redgie, but he is <emph>truer.</emph> Just do look at Redgie now, Lucia! It is
                     too bad the way he is going on with Grace Sharp. He is doing that to tease me."
                     Louise took her fan and gave it a little vengeful shake; her cousin caught the
                     movement. We could see him laugh over Grace Sharp's shoulder. He bent more
                     assiduously than ever over beautiful Grace, Ah, me! It must be pleasant to be
                     beautiful. "It is the best letter of introduction a woman can have" somebody
                     says. One of Grace's roses fell from her hair; Mr. Laurie caught it—kept it;
                     playing with it; putting it to his lips. Grace let him keep it. After a while,
                     he dropped it slyly over into the pit. I saw it flutter down, down—he put his
                     hand behind his back to do it, as he stood leaning on the corner of Grace's
                     box—she could not see it. Louise pointed out several acquaintances of hers. In
                     the Ambassador's box there was a Col. McLellan, a handsome man in American
                     uniform. Then there were a number of ladies from the South, Louise knew.
                     Several times in the course of the evening, feeling that instinctive
                     consciousness of being the object of a fixed gaze, I looked up and met Mr.
                     Laurie's lorgnette fixed full on me. I wonder he did not rather look down on
                     Grace's lovely countenance. I suppose he has some curiosity about me after my
                     absurd conduct. Pah! My cheek burns now to think of it. After awhile he quitted
                     Grace's box and went away. Later in the evening I saw him sitting in the
                     parquette, alone. He was looking then at our loge, watching Louise I
                     suppose</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE OPERA IN THE OPPOSITE LOGE.</head>
                  <p>REGINALD, though ostensibly absorbed in his devotion to the beautiful Grace,
                     was himself conscious that much of his thought and attention was furtively
                     directed towards Madame Bernard's loge. He could not shake off the obtruding
                     recollection of that fair sweet face crimsoned with blushes, and the large
                     dreamy eyes swimming in tears, that had rushed so suddenly on his sight. He was
                     rather unimpressible, but this scene had made some impression on him. He was a
                     thorough man of the world, or of society, which, after all, forms, according to
                     the meaning in the restricted dialect of fashion, but a very minimum portion of
                     the world God and the angels look at. Reginald understood perfectly well, and
                     was thoroughly accomplished in all the carelessly graceful ways, the flattering
                     well-turned phrases of <emph>almost</emph> exaggerated compliment, the apparent
                     absorption, the affected sentimentality of look and word, the persiflage, the
                     gold leaf of conversation, the badinage, the repartee which are all so
                     brilliant, so charming, so heartless, and which men consider themselves
                     justified in using towards any woman, simply from <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >passer le temps.</foreign> Women of the world have to go through this sort
                     of mental gymnastic training in order to be prepared for the Olympic arena of
                     Life in Society. Perhaps a silly unfledged girl or so may suffer in this
                     unequal contest; there are soft, weak, loving hearts—Ophelia like—that break
                     and die, or go mad, sometimes, under the refining seven-times heated fire of
                     this grand porcelain furnace of "Society"; but that is <emph>their</emph>
                     "affaire," not the world's. This sort of athletic training, too, rubs off all
                     the delicate morbidities of the weak feminine soul. It is a regimen usually
                     regarded as strengthening. It certainly is <emph>hardening.</emph> (Is that a
                     synonym?) "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Il faut s'amuser!</foreign>" Only we have
                     all managed somehow to make this life of ours so much harder, so much more
                     intricate and miserable, than God, perhaps, intended it to be.</p>
                  <p>Reginald Laurie would have shot any man who dared accuse him of attempting to
                     corrupt the virtue of any respectable woman; but why should not Reginald Laurie
                     flirt with pretty penniless Grace Sharp, even while he knew his eyes were
                     painfully magnetized towards the spot where he saw the dreamy brown orbs of
                     gentle Lucia Dare gleam? Why did he think—"I wish she would smile. I should
                     like to see her face light up. There, she does smile, in answer to Louise. What
                     a lovely, exquisite creature it is!" While he leaned carelessly over
                     Grace—"Louise would paint well in pastel; wouldn't she, Miss Sharp? How easy to
                     bring out effects with all that black and red, and her magnolia skin, in
                     colored chalks I Don't you remember those volcano pictures,—black mountains and
                     red flames?" said he</p>
                  <p>"So Louise Peyrault is really your cous in," said Grace, lifting up her violet
                     blue eyes with such a bright, bright gleam.</p>
                  <p>"She really has the honor of being my mother's niece, Miss Sharp," replied
                     Reginald, stooping low, until his black curls nearly touched Grace's ringlets,
                     in the most tender attitude, half laughing, as, by a sly glance towards Madame
                     Bernard's box, he caught the angry whirl of Louise's fan. Taking Grace's
                     fairy-like éventail, a composition of mother of pearl and feathery down, whilst
                     pretending to use it solely for Miss Sharp's benefit, he threw a quick gesture
                     of defiance towards his cousin. It had its effect. Louise informed him by a
                     hasty wave of her telegraphic instrument that she should pay no further
                     attention to him, if he choose to make a fool of himself,—then deliberately
                     turning herself, so that he could only catch a glimpse of the profile of her
                     haughty face, Louise leaned one arm on the velvet cushions of her box, and
                     devoted her whole attention to the stage, addressing an occasional observation
                     to Lucia, who was absorbed and enthralled in Carvalho's beautiful singing. Not
                     being versed in the mysteries of fan language, Lucia was in innocent
                     unconsciousness of the by-play between the cousins.</p>
                  <p>"I don't think Louise likes me much," observed Grace plaintively to
                     Reginald.</p>
                  <p>"You must not require me to accept impossibilities in my creed, Miss Sharp,"
                     replied Reginald.</p>
                  <p>"How! What impossibility do I suggest to you, Mr. Laurie?"</p>
                  <p>"That it is <emph>possible</emph> for any human being, having ever known Miss
                     Sharp, should not 'like' her. 'Like' was the word you used, was it not?"
                     Reginald's eyes were fine, a tender glance became him, his manner was
                        <emph>so</emph> sentimental. Grace was right well skilled, too, in this sort
                     of fencing. She had known more men than this one, but her cheek flushed a
                     little now.</p>
                  <p>"What other word would you substitute, Mr. Laurie, where girls are concerned?"
                     with a slight laugh of embarrassment, playing with her fan, which Reginald had
                     restored to her.</p>
                  <p>Reginald made a detour. "It is strange, Miss Sharp, that the English is almost
                     the only language which makes a distinction in the verbs of affection. The
                     German says 'Ich liebe dich' to his mistress, his friend, and his lager. The
                     Frenchman, 'j'aime'; the Spaniard, 'amo,' while we make such a difference
                     between 'I like' and 'I love.' Don't you think it a peculiarity of our
                     language?"</p>
                  <p>The violet blue eyes were fairly down now; Grace's pulse gave a throb. "I don't
                     know but that it is, Mr. Laurie; but tell me, <emph>did</emph> you observe
                     Louise's great friend, the honorable Miss Dare? Were you presented to her?"</p>
                  <p>"I grieve to say I was not," said Reginald, this time speaking literal truth.
                     He <emph>was</emph> sorry that Louise had not overstepped Madame Bernard's
                     prudential rules and introduced him to Lucia.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, of course. I suppose Madame would not permit. But, at any rate, you
                        <emph>saw</emph> her. Do you think her pretty?"</p>
                  <p>If Grace could only have read Reginald's thoughts. His eye flashed
                     mischievously.</p>
                  <p>"Pretty! Do you call that sort of woman <emph>pretty?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Let's look at her," taking Grace's ivory lorgnette and deliberately surveying
                     Madame Bernard's box.</p>
                  <p>"She's pretty well dressed, isn't she? Quite a favorable relief to ma'
                     cousine's black lace frock and fiery flowers. That lilac gown with pink roses
                     and white lace thing about the bare neck and arms—what do you call that lace
                     article, Miss Sharp?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! that is a white tulle guimpe, and her lilac gown is made à la paysanne. Of
                     course she dresses well; she has plenty of money and carte blanche at the
                     mantua-maker's."</p>
                  <p>Grace looked down on her own heavy cuir colored silk dress with a half sigh.
                     Perhaps Louise was wrong about the total lack of taste in this girl—perhaps she
                        <emph>had</emph> to wear what she could get? Somebody may have given her the
                     pale pink roses which drooped so languidly in her dead gold hair—she may have
                     had nothing else to make a coiffure of? Louise often gave advice to her
                     favorites among the girls about their dress, and <emph>very</emph> often most
                     generously gave the whole toilette, when she knew her friends were unable to
                     procure such articles of feminine gear as she considered requisite. She would
                     strip herself of ornament any day for one of the girls she liked, and more than
                     one girl on a festive occasion, going to her room, would find need to perform a
                     merry pas styrien around the couch, where Louise had stolen in during the
                     absence, en classe, and spread out an elegant full toilette, fitting a
                     merveille. Louise delighted to do such acts. She only required absolute silence
                     in the recipient—never allowed any expression of gratitude, more than the
                     gliding in of the fair-robed creatures to exhibit themselves, and they would
                     cast their arms about her neck with a rapturous kiss—</p>
                  <p>"Oh! belle Etoile! comme c'est charmante!"</p>
                  <p>But Louise never gave Grace any thing—very few people did.</p>
                  <p>"Well," continued Redgie, "it suits her very well—she's a soft, dimpled sort of
                     a woman—isn't she? What great eyes she has!—a little too pale, perhaps. Is she
                     always so?"</p>
                  <p>"I believe she has been ill, before she came here—Madame is always coddling her
                     up! Of course Louise Peyrault, with her hundreds of slaves, and Lucia Dare,
                        are<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6308-00000018"/> wonderful favorites with any
                     French school-mistress."</p>
                  <p>Grace spoke sharply. Reginald looked at her—then said lightly—</p>
                  <p>"Ah, of course! ainsi va le monde; but I don't think Miss Dare
                        <emph>pretty!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, she's not your style, I suppose," said Grace, thinking of her own
                     forget-me not eyes, snowy skin, and gold, gold hair: "most people think her
                     very pretty; but then you know such an heiress! and belonging to one of the
                     noblest and most distinguished families in Great Britain; the only
                     daughter—indeed, I expect the only child of Sir Hugh Dare—of course she would
                     be universally admired, even if without any pretensions to beauty."</p>
                  <p>"How is she the only child? I thought there was a brother; I heard something of
                     a brother, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>The topic interested Reginald, so he continued it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, so there was a brother; but he ran away, went off some where, and never
                     has been heard of yet. If he never turns up, Lucia will be Countess Dare, Lady
                     Vail, and gracious knows how many long titles to her name. I heard Madame
                     rehearsing them all to somebody the other day."</p>
                  <p>Reginald was not pleased with <emph>this</emph> piece of information; it was
                     already a bit of wormwood cast into his cup of existence, to be convinced that
                     the lovely, gentle girl who had made a deep impression upon his not susceptible
                     heart, was so far, so very far removed from his sphere of life—no use to look
                     over there at Madame Bernard's loge—she was up above him; no use to stretch out
                     his arms, he could never, reach her.</p>
                  <p>"As well might love a bright particular," he muttered to himself.</p>
                  <p>"What are you saying, Mr. Laurie?" asked Grace, as she noticed his lips moving,
                     and the half cloud that swept across his brow.</p>
                  <p>Reginald recovered himself in an instant.</p>
                  <p>"Thinking! I <emph>do,</emph> sometimes. Do you know Spanish, Miss Sharp?"</p>
                  <p>"No!"</p>
                  <p>"Pardon! Then you will have to loan me that exquisite little tablet swinging to
                     your chatelaine, and I will make what Willis calls "a hurry graph"—a rough
                     translation of some lines that I recall just now."</p>
                  <p>Grace willingly detached the tablet—Reginald took it, leaned on the barriére of
                     the box, and wrote: <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>Grace read the lines with flushed cheeks as Reginald presented the tablet with
                     a bow of careless grace.</p>
                  <p>"Who wrote them?"</p>
                  <p>"Lope de Vega!"</p>
                  <p>"Where?"</p>
                  <p>"In 'La hermosa Fea."</p>
                  <p>"What does that mean?"</p>
                  <p>"The beautiful ugly one!" said Reginald with a smile of malicious mischief in
                     his eye, but not on his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Grace looked at him doubtingly—she could not make him out. Was he laughing at
                     her or not? A flash of anger passed through her soul at the doubt; Reginald saw
                     it; in a moment he rose gaily.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Miss Sharp, I have bored you until you are weary. I am going down in the
                     parquette. I see a friend there I must speak to, so, au revoir." Taking her
                     hand he bent over it so low that she almost feared he would touch it with his
                     lips—but he didn't—then he dropped it, and left the loge; went down in the
                     parquette; did speak to a man he knew, then deliberately seated himself in a
                     retired corner, and turning his lorgnette on Madame Bernard's loge, he kept it
                     fixed there for the rest of the evening. When Louise discovered Reginald had
                     quitted Grace, she settled herself in a most comfortable attitude, and tried to
                     find him out among the crowd; but she did not succeed in doing so.</p>
                  <p>Grace was the prettiest American girl in Paris, in spite of her bad dressing.
                     She could afford to have those pink roses tumbling all down through her yellow
                     curls. She had a real Flora's head, as she sat there in her leather colored
                     silk. If she had had only a little more rétenue, had not been so restless and
                     so fidgetty, biting her scarlet lips, and perpetually moving her pink stumpy
                     little fingers! What a contrast to Louise or the quiet Lucia—Louise, who sat in
                     perfect, absolute statuesque immobility of person and costume—even her gown
                     drooped in quiescence, her hands lay like white marble, unless she raised her
                     heavy-carved Havanese fan, and waved it with the grace of one born to its
                     usage. Louise conveyed a mixed sensation of repose and movement. When she was
                     not speaking she was still all over; but if she spoke, in an instant a thousand
                     points of electric vitality darted out from her eyes, brow, lips, fan,
                     hands—all talked, then she was just as suddenly still again. So are leopards
                     and pantheresses. Grace was soon surrounded by a bevy of admirers, who had been
                     regarding Reginald's monopoly of her attention with any other than amiable
                     eyes. She apparently forgot Reginald in a full tide of flirtation with
                     half-a-dozen other men. Grace's friends had proposed to remove her from the
                     Pension and keep her with them for a while in lodgings, from whence she could
                     attend only as a part-day scholar at Madame Bernard's. She was so very
                     beautiful, they thought she might perhaps make a good marriage if she had a
                     little chance. Grace therefore had plenty of time for her beaux. She intended
                     to enjoy herself in her own way; she was rather taken with Reginald. He was so
                     handsome, so careless, so audacious, and a good parti; she had met him,
                     sometime previous, while on a visit to friends at the Hotel du Louvre; she had
                     seen a good deal of him then; he interested, amused, provoked her. She hated
                     him at times, and then again—</p>
                  <p>If Reginald Laurie had been true to this girl, would it have changed her
                     character much? If the feeling of preference she was conscious of, and
                        <emph>he</emph> was conscious she felt for him, could have ripened or
                     matured into womanly love, would it have softened and developed all that was
                     tender and true in her nature? Who can tell? At any rate, it was the one
                     softness of her whole life. If Grace ever sinned afterwards, she did it
                     premeditatedly and from desire of excitement, or other ulterior motive. She
                     loved Reginald Laurie now, and when in after years she poured vial after vial
                     of revenge upon his head—she loved him still. Grace began to see that Reginald
                     was only trifling with her—began to see it this evening—she grasped her little
                     slender fan, as the thought passed through her brain, so violently under her
                     perfumed handkerchief, that she crushed the slender ribs of pearl, even while
                     she was smiling up into Monsieur B—'s admiring eyes.</p>
                  <p>When the opera was over, and Madame Bernard came out with her party, Reginald
                     was waiting in the cloaking-room. He went up to his cousin. Louise received him
                     with a grave face, and a sly pinch on his arm as she took it. There was quite a
                     crowd, and Madame was glad of the additional escort. She knew it was en régle
                     for Louise's cousin to escort <emph>her;</emph> but she was not altogether so
                     satisfied to see a presentation to Lucia, and that she also had been disposed
                     of on Reginald's other arm. However, it could not be helped then. They were
                     soon in their carriage, and Madame bade "Mr. Laurie" a most suave and amiable
                     good-night, interiorly resolving that Lucia should not again be exposed to
                     meeting him if she could help it! Madame had a wide-spread and well-merited
                     reputation for surveillance. Poor little Lucia had no thought of any danger to
                     herself, or that she was at that very instant the subject of intense emotion to
                     so many hearts. Madame's feelings on the subject we already know. Louise
                     thought, "I don't like the way Redgie looked at Lucia, I am sorry I introduced
                     him; but he made me—he always does have his own way, and he is so saucy and
                     such a flirt! I must warn Lucia against Redgie if I see any occasion for it."
                     And Reginald, <emph>he</emph> walked along the streets with a gay, light step,
                     as if moved with wings. Instead of going to his chambers, he lighted a cigar,
                     and strolled out into the quiet garden of the Tuilleries. He threw himself down
                     on a bench under one of the superb elm trees, whose quivering leaves, moved by
                     the sigh of the night wind, broke the moonlight into a thousand fantastic
                     glimmering rays, that played all over him as he sat half reclining. He did what
                     he had never done before in his life, dreamed with his eyes open—dreamed of the
                     pale, lovely English girl—saw her face, now bathed in tears, now dimpling in
                     smiles, blushing, changing as he caught the shy, half-conscious, embarrassed,
                     innocent glance of those brown, brown eyes. Bah! they looked up into a man's
                     face like a helpless baby's! He wished he could do something for that wistful
                     little thing! He would like to please her somehow—find her brother, or give her
                     a doll, or—take her in his great, strong man's arms and pet her; and look as
                     much as he chose away down through her transparent eyes into the depths of that
                     pure, sweet, sweet soul, and kiss that tender child's mouth, so tremulous with
                     feeling. So Reginald, the lion of society, dreamed. At last he awakened with a
                     light, scornful laugh at himself, threw away the unsmoked cigar, whose fire had
                     died out, à son insçu in his reverie, stopped humming "the shadow song," and
                     drumming on the bench with his gloved finger-ends, sprang up and walked hastily
                     homewards.</p>
                  <p>"What a confounded spooney! and all because I see two eyes 'so soft and brown'
                     streaming with tears—a girl, a <emph>baby,</emph> a female 'Japheth' takes
                        <emph>me</emph> for a harum-scarum wandering brother of her's, and I touch
                     for an instant a tiny, tiny gloved hand, that I shall probably never, never
                     touch again! Confound Louise and her friends. Grace Sharp <emph>is</emph>
                     prettier! 'Lady Dare, Countess Vail!' Don't be insane, Reginald Laurie. Let the
                     unapproachable fair Britannia sail on in her chariot in the ether above—one
                     might as well dream of the guardian genius of England; and yet there might be
                     found a St. George to do battle for such a Una.<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000019"/> 'Una,' the only one, the fairest of woman-kind,
                     that's not a bad name of old Spenser's—I like the name Una—"</p>
                  <p>Louise was partly right, partly unjust in her prejudiced drawing of Grace
                     Sharp's character. Grace had a peculiar nature—rather obtuse and cold-blooded
                     she was; but she had this generosity in common with her congeners of the
                     rattlesnake family—she had to be attacked before she offered to strike. Then,
                     indeed, she made a vengeful coil, she sprung her rattles and she struck with
                     all the poison latent in her temperament. She was slow but she never forgave,
                     never forgot; revenge might be delayed, but it came, in course of time, in some
                     form. The girls at school knew this instinctively—they were all afraid of the
                     beautiful Grace—all save Louise, who was like the wild red deer of her own
                     forests, naturally an enemy of all the serpent tribe; the doe recognizes them
                     intuitively, and gathering all her four sharp-pointed hoofs together she will
                     rush at them, spring madly upon the fatal coil, and stamp and tear and crush
                     the writhing reptile into a lifeless mass, at sight, without any provocation
                     whatever. Grace felt this, and a dull, torpid, obstinate hate of Louise
                     Peyrault had grown with her growth, during these long school-years of her life.
                     Louise's characteristics made her the queen of the school. The girls, teachers,
                     Madame herself, were enthralled by the graceful, impassioned, magnanimous,
                     impulsive, genial, yet proud creole. Louise was noble and generous as the day,
                     unpretending and free from all affectations, but self-asserting and en grade in
                     an instant when attacked. She unconsciously found her level, and was generally
                     adored by the girls who profited by her extravagant generosity and hasty
                     enthusiasms. Louise made mistakes often, but then she acknowledged them as
                     readily, would seek explanation and reparation with the humility and
                     self-condemnation of a little child. Grace Sharp never was known to confess an
                     error; even if sometimes, for she was not altogether stolid, she would make
                     secret endeavors to expiate or repair a wrong she had done any other, she never
                     acknowledged a fault. She may have inherited some characteristics, as Louise
                     declared she did, from her Puritan ancestry; but if she possessed the
                     perseverance, the ingenuity, the tenacity of a Yankee from her birth, she had
                     added to them other qualities acquired during her long school-life in France.
                     The ingenuity grew to be finesse and artifice; the energy a motive power,
                     wrongly directed; the ambition and perseverance abased into worldiness, and
                     eye-service in the corrupt atmosphere of that French school. She had not been
                     in Massachusetts since she was four years old. Without parents, her father, an
                     agent for a mercantile house, having died abroad whilst engaged in his duties,
                     she had been left at this school, where he had deposited her, by distant
                     relatives, who considered they were fulfilling all their responsibilities
                     towards the orphan, by economizing the very limited means belonging to her,
                     which enabled them to educate her, they hoped, to qualify her to be a teacher,
                     so as to make her own living without further encumbering them. Louise would
                     have shrunk with horror at the suggestion—she would have burned off her right
                     hand, as Mutius Scoevola did, had she known or believed that she was helping to
                     degrade this girl's soul, aiding the powers of evil to develop all that was
                     unlovely in Grace's nature, by unjust suspicion, open accusation, haughty
                     prejudice. But it was really so; at the impartial bar of God, Louise Peyrault
                     would have to answer sorely for the wrong done this sister's soul.</p>
                  <p>Lucia Dare, a clinging nature, succumbed immediately to the wondrous charm of
                     Louise's shifting, brilliant, varied organization; she yielded, like all the
                     rest, to the fascination of this Cleopatra-girl and fairly worshiped Louise,
                     with the lavish Dulia of girlhood.</p>

                  <p>THE next morning after the rencontre at the opera, Reginald went out, bought a
                     small copy in biscuit of John Bell's Una and her Lion, and set it up on his
                     mantelshelf, in place of the French clock, in front of the mirror. It looked
                     very pretty there. That evening, not knowing very well what to do with himself,
                     wearied of lounging and dreaming, for he had made no progress at all in the
                     study of the volume of Burgundian law he was just then trying to read during
                     the day. He sat leaning back in his chair looking at the Una, when he suddenly
                     pitched his book on the table, made a careful toilet, picked up his hat, and
                     went round to see Grace Sharp. Grace received him, as usual, with smiles; but
                     there was a dull sort of ache in her ordinarily cold heart as she looked up in
                     his handsome face. She began to distrust him, yet she felt herself gradually
                     succumbing to the spell of his presence in spite of herself. Redgie was gay,
                     excited, nervous, as much as a strong man could be—he felt wretchedly oppressed
                     and despondent, and there was soothing in Grace's interest and sympathy; so he
                     stayed late, drinking this invisible syrup of poppies,—involuntary incense to
                     his vanity. He had fine horses at livery. He offered to teach Grace how to
                     ride. Riding on horseback is scarcely an accomplishment for a Southern man or
                     woman. Everybody rides as a matter of course. The rarity would be in the
                     exception. Louise and Lucia, an English girl, both rode like Amazons; but the
                     pretty Grace had not had their advantages. So Reginald charitably proffered to
                     supply this deficit in Grace's education. It was an impulse on his part, this
                     proposition, that he swore at himself afterwards for giving way to. But Grace
                     was so pleased! "Well, confound it, a man's not responsible for follies induced
                     by the influence of a pretty woman," said Redgie to himself, as he examined
                     carefully the bridle and saddle and girths before mounting Grace on that
                     memorable evening. When the tuition began, after the rides were fairly
                     inaugurated, it was not so disagreeable. It became a matter of course for Mr.
                     Laurie's fine horses to stamp their hoofs three or four times a week before
                     Miss Sharp's lodgings; and Grace learned to ride very well,—very well, indeed,
                     and very beautiful she was in her habit. The Frenchmen used to stare at her and
                     make audible remarks of admiration; and Redgie liked it very well too.</p>
                  <p>There are fine opportunities for <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pétits soins</foreign>
                     in this branch of education. Slight hand-pressures in drawing the silken reins
                     through the lady's fingers, a warm clasping of the little foot set in the hand
                     which elevates a damsel to the saddle, a resting of the hand on the pommel as
                     the cavalier leans over, keeping the horses to one equal step in narrow,
                     lonely, shady places. Reginald knew all about it. He was half drawn to Grace by
                     her wonderful physical beauty. She had a sort of fascination for him. He
                        <emph>knew</emph> how wicked he was, and yet he taught Grace riding on
                     horseback <emph>diligently.</emph> He knew at the same time he was very much
                     attracted by Lucia Dare; but it was pleasant to make Grace smile and beam and
                     blush and grow soft and womanly. Nobody else could do it. No one else ever did
                     Never. The liquid rock hardened into lava after this,—lava mingled with useless
                     scoriæ.</p>
                  <p>Reginald Laurie, in after years, persuaded himself that 'twas an apple of
                     Sodom, this fair girl, with the soul of ashes and wormwood; but, God knows,
                     perhaps it was not originally. Plato says, "No man is voluntarily evil." Plato
                     was wise sometimes,—wiser than Reginald Laurie or Louise Peyrault, or some of
                     the rest of us moderns.</p>
                  <p>By Sir Hugh's command, there was an equipage kept at livery near Madame
                     Bernard's for Lucia's use. Sir Hugh did not choose Miss Dare should take
                     exercise like the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille,</foreign> so there was a
                     neat, handsome barouche, with a couple of noble greys, a coachman in a wig, and
                     a footman with a gold stick and red clothes driven up every afternoon at a
                     certain hour to await Miss Dare's pleasure. This pleased Madame greatly, and
                     perhaps much of that lady's devotion to Lucia might have arisen from the fact
                     that she could make use of "dear Lucia's" turnout whenever it was convenient.
                     Lucia drove out thus every day, generally in the Bois de Boulogne, accompanied
                     by Miss Liston, the English teacher, and always by Louise, to whose stronger
                     nature Lucia clung like a lichen upon a tree.</p>
                  <p>Reginald managed to find out where they rode,—a gold piece to the footman
                     arranged <emph>that</emph> easily,—and he would generally ride that way too—he
                     and Grace Sharp.</p>
                  <p>Louise was not at all pleased with her cousin. Louise's was an Ithuriel nature,
                     true to the core—she hated falsities.</p>
                  <p>"Ah," she said to Lucia, "truly Redgie is very fascinating; he is so brilliant,
                     so self-reliant, so handsome, so obstinate, and so very audacious! <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Et plus!</foreign> He really <emph>is</emph> good-hearted,
                     that is, he has good impulses; he is also refined, and a thorough gentleman in
                        <emph>society.</emph> There is nothing coarse about Redgie; he is not even
                     unprincipled—immoral, but he is—so—" Louise hesitated as if searching for a
                     word. Lucia looked at her in some surprise; she could not understand why Louise
                     should speak of Reginald in this manner to her. Lucia was an innocent little
                     thing, knew little of society or the world; however, she listened with interest
                     to anything Louise chose to say, so she answered now—</p>
                  <p>"So what, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"So—well, Lucia, so careless, so heedless about women, so different from my
                     Philip. I do hate male flirts." Louise's cheeks flushed and her eyes
                     darkened.</p>
                  <p>Grace and Redgie had just passed on horse-back,—the two girls saw them from a
                     window.</p>
                  <p>"He don't care for Grace, Lucia, he does not. I know Redgie. He is only
                     flirting."</p>
                  <p>"That's a great pity," said Lucia gently.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it is not only a pity, but it is a shame," burst out Louise. "If I was
                     Grace's brother I'd shoot Redgie, I would; not that I like Grace, for I don't,
                     but I hate to see a woman trifled with so. I hate it. Redgie is full of
                     talent,—really gifted: he could be or do anything he pleased. He is ambitious
                     too, I know. He is not studying half as much as he ought. Uncle Laurie is very
                     rich, and of course Redgie is not compelled to work; but he has so many
                     talents—is the only male left in the family, and we are all ambitions for him.
                     All the Lauries are intellectual. Uncle is a very learned man, and Annie,
                     Redgie's sister, is the most admirable accomplished woman I ever knew or heard
                     of—she knows everything almost."</p>
                  <p>"Mercy! but I should be afraid of such a woman as that, Louise."</p>
                  <p>"No, you would not, Lucia. Annie Laurie is as sweet and simple and good and<pb
                        n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6308-00000020"/> loving, as if she did not know her
                     alphabet. My dear, you would have to live with her a long time before you
                     discovered the extent of her acquirements. I love her dearly, dearly; so would
                     you, Lucia. I am proud of Annie Laurie!"</p>
                  <p>"Is she very pretty?" a woman's first question about another. Lucia was
                     thinking of Redgie too.</p>
                  <p>"Pretty," said Louise, thoughtfully,—"she has such a changeable face. At times
                     I think her the very prettiest woman I over saw, and then—. See here, Lucia! Do
                     you think <emph>this</emph> pretty?" pointing to a gracefully moulded lamp of
                     alabaster, swinging from a bracket in her apartment, where she and Lucia were
                     sitting.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I think it is graceful;" replied Lucia, "nothing remarkable about
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"That was a present from Redgie. He brought it from Florence the other day."
                     Louise rose, lighted a wax taper, put it inside of the lamp, bringing out, by
                     means of the light, beautiful Greek carvings and figures—"What do you think of
                     it <emph>now,</emph> Lucia?"</p>
                  <p>"I think it is perfectly exquisite—perfectly lovely, Louise."</p>
                  <p>"That's Annie Laurie. She looks a good deal like Redgie; has the same changeful
                     eyes and mobile face, and the same ease, and more fascination, because
                        <emph>she</emph> is thoroughly good, and Redgie <emph>is not!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"How old is she?"</p>
                  <p>"About twenty—she is younger than Redgie, but she has had so much care and
                     responsibility that her manners are graver than most girls. Uncle Laurie has
                     been blind a great many years, and Aunt Laurie died long ago. Annie's elder
                     sister also died, and her young husband, with yellow fever, leaving one little
                     daughter, Margaret Guion, and Annie has taken care of Uncle Laurie and little
                     Margaret ever since. She was herself a child in years, so this care has made
                     Annie so sweet and so patient, and ordinarily grave."</p>
                  <p>"And so she has never married?"</p>
                  <p>"No! how could she? though I suppose she might have still lived on with Uncle
                     if she had. She never would leave him, I don't think. She is very much admired,
                     but never seems to care for any of those men who come about her, though I
                     always thought—"</p>
                  <p>Louise stopped short, looked at Lucia, then said, "Pshaw! you will never see
                     them—it don't matter my telling you. I stayed at Uncle Laurie's and went to
                     school with Annie. We had a teacher once—the last master we had for several
                     years—his name was Harold Ashton. He was not an ordinary man; without being
                     what you would call handsome, his face was full of power and strength. He was
                     most eloquent in conversation—very cultivated; lofty, chivalrous, ambitious.
                     Annie always loved study: but it seemed to me she liked better to study with
                     Mr. Ashton than she ever did before or since—they used to spend every spare
                     moment together over their books."</p>
                  <p>"What sort of books did they study?"</p>
                  <p>"All sorts—Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Spanish, German—all sorts."</p>
                  <p>Lucia opened her eyes. "She must indeed be accomplished."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Ashton was studying law at nights whilst he stayed at Uncle
                     Laurie's. Do you know, Lucia, Annie studied law too! He did not know—nor
                     anybody but I—but our rooms adjoined, and I used to see the books in her room.
                     As fast as he would finish one book and replace it in Uncle Laurie's law
                     library, Annie would take it out and read it. She used to read late, late at
                     night, and then be up attending to everything the next day, just as any other
                     woman. Mr. Ashton went away. I happened to go into the library the day he left.
                     He was standing by Annie, holding her hand; they had both been weeping, and I
                     heard him say, just as I entered—</p>
                  <p>"Never, Annie! never—not even from your hand—I could not accept dependence,
                     even on the woman I love better than life. When I conquer a position and a name
                     worthy of you I will come, but not—till then. Can you wait—can you trust
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"I did not hear what Annie said, for I got out of the room as quickly as I
                     could. Mr. Ashton went away to New Orleans, and began to practice law. He used
                     to write to Annie, I know. I could always tell when she had a letter from
                     him—there was such a lovely light in her face. But there is no announced
                     engagement between them. Uncle Laurie has a distant relative, a young man, very
                     rich, and a splendidly handsome fellow, that he always wanted Annie to marry.
                     But she never liked Edward Morris. I don't,—he makes me feel exactly as Grace
                     Sharp does,—as if a serpent was crawling near me—"</p>
                  <p>Lucia laughed. "You believe so much in instincts, and natural
                     antipathies,—Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I do. I know false people, by in tuition, Lucia, and hate them, and would
                     destroy them, I expect, if I could—as turkies and hogs do snakes."</p>
                  <p>Lucia was naturally interested in the accounts Louise would give her of her
                     American home and relatives; but it certainly was not favorable to the effect
                     Louise intended her warnings to have, that she did discuss so often Reginald's
                     imperfections, or speak of those so near to him as well as herself, until Lucia
                     grew familiar with their names and characters.</p>
                  <p>Lucia framed a very attractive picture in her mind of the household group,
                     gathered together on those far away hills of Natchez. She re-read
                     Chateaubriand, which Louise declared was no more a description of Natchez than
                     it was of Paris of London. But all these poetic associations, this film of
                     fiction, began to collect around the image of Reginald Laurie, till he grew to
                     be surrounded with an atmosphere of golden mist, to be a real "child of the
                     sun." Indeed Lucia thought more frequently than was admissible of this wolf in
                     lamb's clothing, terrible trifler, and breaker of women's hearts—"Redgie!" She
                     fancied Louise was rather hard upon him; that he might have injustice done him.
                     He never looked frightful—au contraire when they met in the usual promenade—a
                     soft, earnest glance always fell on her, some how—and she liked meeting the
                     eager smile on those proud lips, and to receive the low, reverent salute with
                     which he always passed her carriage.</p>
                  <p>"Regie <emph>was</emph> graceful," Louise acknowledged that. Madame Bernard was
                     strict—strict—in surveillance; it behooved her to be so.</p>
                  <p>"He, then, who intends to be a good and worthy state's guardian, must be a
                     philosopher, spirited, swift and strong," read Redgie aloud, from Plato's
                     Republic, as he sat in his apartment, right in front of John Bell's Una. "I
                     don't see that I am progressing very rapidly towards that goal. I wish I had
                     never known Grace Sharp! I wish Louise would cease her never-ending whispers of
                     reproach in my ears! I wish I was out of Paris, and I wish"—here came a long
                     pause, while he looked at Una, and played the air of Brightest Eyes, with his
                     fingers, on the back of his book.</p>
                  <p>Louise was mistaken; Reginald studied, and studied hard. Already his intimates
                     prophesied bright rewards of fame for him in the arduous profession he had
                     chosen. He stood high in the esteem of <emph>men.</emph> Reginald was possessed
                     of an iron will, and a profound, though latent ambition. He appeared more
                     frivolous than he really was. He went out, after hard study, into the world,
                     into society, for relaxation. He liked the companionship of women—not the
                     coarse mingling with grisettes and Lorettes of the Quartier Latin; but he liked
                     the presence, the conversation, the atmosphere of fair, pure ladies, such as he
                     had been accustomed to in his own family circle, where he met in daily
                     intercourse women of the highest type, his sister Annie, Louise Peyrault, and
                     their friends. Then he liked to please—he liked to say courteous and gallant
                     things; he believed no woman was ever really ungratified when a man made love
                     to her, so as he was possessed of great personal facilities, and it was a light
                     excitement, and the interests in any <emph>pursuit</emph> was agreeable, even
                     if transient; he used to sigh and look sentimental, without going far enough to
                     give a girl an absolute right to complain, or for her brother, if she had one,
                     to call him out. Girls are shy, in the nineteenth century, of playing the role
                     of Ariadne or Dido! So Reginald had not been shot yet. Like all men of his
                     stamp, Reginald was attracted by the unattainable; he always wanted the grapes
                     out of his reach, and was never mean enough to say they were sour, because he
                     could not gather them. He called occasionally on Louise, but of course saw no
                     one else at Madame Bernard's. Louise wouldn't talk about Lucia, so he had to
                     give up any idea of influence favorable in that quarter—favorable to what?—not
                     to any hopes—he had no hopes, if he had unacknowledged desires. He wished very
                     often to see Miss Dare. He yearned for the sound of her voice, the touch of her
                     hand, but he was very proud. He knew that pretension on his part at
                        <emph>any</emph> time, would be the maddest madness, and he had not the
                     slightest idea of exposing himself to ridicule. He had no plans, no fixed
                     wishes; he only knew how much he liked to see her—she was so tender and
                     feminine—so sweet! He knew that when he caught a glimpse of those lovely eyes,
                     and a smile and bow of recognition, the earth seemed somehow glorified, and the
                     plain, neat equipage, with the sedate coachman, assumed a kind of fairy
                     glamour, like Cinderella's coach of gold. That girl haunted him. The birds in
                     the Tuilleries sung "Lucia, Lucia," and the wind sighed it, and books reflected
                     it. Reginald cursed his lot, and wished devoutly he had never gone to try a
                     lorgnette in the Rue de la Paix—and the exorcism he used to lay this spirit
                     which tormented him, was the society of beautiful—beautiful—Grace Sharp. Grace
                     watched Ridgie; she saw the joy which would beam out, instantaneously if they
                     met Miss Dare's carriage; but then Louise was always there too, and the
                     creole's eyes would dance in spite of her efforts to look grave, and she would
                     kiss her fingers in Spanish style, or wave a word in fan-language, to her
                     cousin, as they passed each other; so Grace continued puzzled, doubtful, and
                     interested about Reginald's devotions.</p>
                  <p>"If thou canst not make thyself such a one as thou wouldst, how caust thou
                     expect to have another, in all things to thy liking?" said Louise to herself,
                     out of her Thomas a Kemps—"Lucia, oh, you remember these words in Silvio
                     Pellico:</p>
                  <p>"E chi sei tu, o misero mortale, per pretendere che niun tua simile, ti
                     giudiche severamente? per lagnarti se dio permette che tu patisca piuttosti, in
                     un modo che in unaltro?"</p>
                  <p>"Who are you thinking of, Louise?"</p>
                  <p>"Thinking of Redgie and the hardness of this world, Lucia, especially towards
                     women. It will not do for any one ever to strike me or any one I love, Lucia; I

                  <p>"Louise, Louise, you are so prejudiced!"</p>

                  <p>LOUISE'S father and Philip Branger had arrived. It was resolved that Louise
                     should be married immediately, make a tour through Europe, and then return to
                     America. Philip said "she was quite learned enough. He did not want her to be
                        <emph>too</emph> accomplished. He would have difficulty in holding his own
                     now in future family discussions. Another year of Madame Bernard would make her
                        <emph>too</emph> superior to ordinary mortals."</p>
                  <p>Louise confessed she was weary of school-life, and "would rather travel with
                     Philip, papa." So Judge Peyrault laughed, chucked her under the chin, said she
                     was a foolish child, and let the young people have it their own way. Permission
                     was asked for Lucia to officiate as bridesmaid. It was granted by Sir Hugh
                     after ascertaining through the English ambassador that the parties were all
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">comme il faut,</foreign> though Americans. Louise
                     was married, the ceremony being performed by the Archbishop of Paris in the
                     Cathedral of Notre Dame, in the presence of the American and English ministers,
                     their suites, and most of the Americans in Paris at that time. Lucia was
                     bridesmaid and Reginald groomsman. Who so happy as Reginald Laurie? To have
                        <emph>her</emph> hand resting on his arm, to be at liberty to speak to her,
                     to pay her the thousand petty attentions justified by society, and which no man
                     knew how to offer more agreeably and gracefully than he.</p>
                  <p>There was a grand wedding-breakfast for the guests. Louise and Philip
                     disappeared in traveling costume, leaving their friends to discuss the feast at
                     leisure. Reginald was in Paradise for three whole hours. Redgie was young yet.
                     He did not care to analyze or to examine into the cause of his unusual
                     exhilaration to know why he was so joyful, so elated. He <emph>was</emph> fond
                     of Philip and Louise,—it was <emph>proper</emph> for him to be glad when they
                     were so pleased. His uncle Peyrault, even, had not a shadow on his dark,
                     swarthy, smiling face. "Phil was a trump, and Louise was a jewel." Everybody
                     was in good humor. So for Redgie. <q>

                  <p>Grace Sharp saw it all—all, and the deadly serpent-look came into her blue eyes
                     as she gradually understood what game Redgie had been playing with her, with
                     Lucia. As for Lucia, she was such a soft-hearted little thing! Very, very
                     grateful and responsive to love wherever it was truly expressed towards
                     her,—and one fact was very clear, Redgie had scarcely any volition about the
                     attraction to her. It was a feeling that overmastered him in spite of his
                     efforts to conceal it. Strange, unknown emotions began to stir in Lucia's young
                     heart. The hand trembled that lay upon Reginald's arm. The tender cheeks
                     flushed into scarlet at his glance, at his low words of ordinary common-place.
                     Lucia looked up with half frightened, shy, innocent responsiveness into the
                     changeful eyes that seemed ever to seek her's with such deep, such unutterable
                     meanings. Reginald's eyes that morning were soft, tender, and shining as dark
                     blue stars. He had never looked so at Grace Sharp. Grace knew it.</p>
                  <p>It was a gay, gay wedding,—an era in Lucia's hitherto secluded life; though
                     even here, in the midst of the joy bubbling up around her, came flashing
                     thought, like a sharp scimetar—the thought of Gerald. For the first time since
                     he had left her Lucia felt happy without him. Treason, treason to her absent
                     lost one! She had forgotten him,—forgotten him amongst these strangers. In an
                     instant her eyes, that were beaming so bright with happiness, filled up.
                     Reginald was watching her. He saw the sudden cloud and the unshed shower
                     dropping from her heart to her eyes. He leaned over her, and with infinite,
                     inexpressible tenderness, whispered:</p>
                  <p>"What makes you sad just now? Can I aid you?"</p>
                  <p>Is there any quality more moving, more winning, than sympathy
                     unsought—voluntary sympathy—from a strong man to a weak woman?
                        <emph>Lucia</emph> felt there was not. In all the world she recognized at
                     that moment that <emph>she</emph> was much to that man. A sudden thrill of joy
                     ran through her sensitive frame.</p>
                  <p>"I was thinking of my brother," she said in a low voice; "my brother, who may
                     be at this very moment, when all is so gay and joyous here, he, my Gerald, may
                     be in sickness, want, or sorrow. Oh, Mr. Laurie, you don't know how miserable I
                     am all the time! I am never, never at rest about my darling brother!" Tears
                     were dropping now, fast enough, on the "lily hands."</p>
                  <p>Reginald was deeply moved by this sudden turning to him for sympathy and
                     consolation on Lucia's part. He placed himself in such a position as to shield
                     her from the observation of the laughing, satirical crowd of people around
                     them. "Do not weep, Miss Dare. Drink this iced water. Try to regain composure.
                     You do not know how I sympathize with you. I would give—" Reginald paused, then
                     added hastily, in lower tones, "My life is not very valuable, at least to
                     myself; it would not be saying much to declare I would give <emph>that</emph>
                     to serve you or yours."</p>
                  <p>Lucia wiped off her tears, and struggled to regain composure. She was
                     hysterical from excitement—without knowing it women often are, and do foolish
                     things under the influence of overstrained nerves, that they regret in calmer
                     moods. In spite of Louise and all her warnings, Lucia believed in Redgie, che
                     sarà, sarà.</p>
                  <p>Reginald said, as soon as he saw Lucia was calm and quiet, in his sweetest
                     voice, his softest, lowest tones: "Miss Dare, give me a description of your
                     brother, and all you chose to tell me about him, and I will join in your search
                     for him, with all the zeal of Sir Galahad, in quest of the holy Graal!"</p>
                  <p>So Lucia told him all she <emph>could</emph> tell him, and he listened, looking
                     down into her eyes, and gazing on the sweet face, so touchingly eloquent, as
                     she poured forth her story of Gerald's misfortunes. Of her father she said
                     little, as little as she could. Reginald had to guess at that part of the
                     unhappy history. He asked her a few questions in a plain, lawyer-like manner,
                     got all the information she could give him, drew out his pocket-book and made
                     several entries in it; then putting it back again he said: "Miss Dare, I will
                     write, I will <emph>go</emph> to America, or to the end of the earth to do you
                     or your brother any service; trust me, and now be happy, smile again for these
                     few passing moments whilst we"—Reginald hesitated, then said, lowering his
                     voice—"whilst <emph>we</emph> are together."</p>
                  <p>Lucia understood. Ah! Louise, Madame Bernard, where, where are you just at this
                     instant so fraught with danger? Madame Bernard was at that precise moment
                     eating an ice a few yards from where Lucia was sitting, and Louise was flying
                     on the railroad with Philip by her side, on the road to Italy. And so Reginald
                     devoted himself to Lucia, not as he did to Grace or other women, but with a
                     soulful tenderness, an homage, a reverence that he had never shown or
                     experienced towards any other girl. She was so holy, so pure, so innocent, so
                     trusting, so <emph>unattainable</emph> to him. His soul overflowed with
                     tenderness towards the lovely, gentle, half-child, half-woman. He would like to
                     have taken her then and there in his strong arms, and held her so close and so
                     high, that the tips of her satin shoes should never have touched this wicked,
                     cruel earth. He would have defended her against all evil—even now against
                        <emph>himself!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The hours waned, breakfast can't last forever! Madame had eaten and drunken to
                     her heart's content. She had been complimented, elevated, homaged, till all her
                     plumes rustled like a peacock's, by Judge Peyrault and his friends. Louise was
                     a most satisfactory card and excellent advertisement of her establishment, and
                     mode of education. The prettiest girl in Paris, Grace Sharp, and this splendid
                     English heiress, too, now on exhibition, were most gratifying examples of what
                     she could do in the manufacture of elegant ladies. It was a triumphant hour for
                     Madame, and she enjoyed it. But alas! all joys must fade; it was time now to
                     depart. She summoned Lucia. Reginald awoke out of his trance.</p>
                  <p>"How shall I communicate with you—how can I see you?" he said to Lucia, as he
                     led her to the carriage. Lucia looked at him inquiringly. "I mean, of course,
                     if I learn any thing about your brother!" correcting himself. "Louise being
                     gone, will make it all so different, you know!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Lucia, it will all be different enough to me, without Louise; but I
                     will give you the address of my cousin, Mr. Vail. Madame is very particular—I
                     don't think she would permit me to receive you; but if you would write to me,
                     through Cousin Vail, I would get the letter!"</p>
                  <p>Reginald bit his lip—that was not at all what he desired; but his better nature
                     awoke as he looked into the innocent face. He replied softly: "You are right,
                     and Madame is right, dear Miss Dare: a young lady cannot be too careful of less
                     convenances. I would not have you violate one for me. It will be best to
                     communicate entirely through your guardians! And now, who can say when or where
                     we shall meet again? I shall hear, perhaps, through Louise sometimes, if you
                     are well and happy. I hope you will be happy, even should I never see you
                     again. Now God bless you forever, sweet Lucia!"</p>
                  <p>Reginald lifted Lucia's little hand to his lips, as he aided her to enter the
                     carriage. Lucia felt the kiss burn through her glove. Madame was settling
                     herself comfortably on the back seat, trying to avoid crumpling her lace
                     flounces, and could not see what was going on behind her back.</p>
                  <p>"There, you take the oder seat, opposed, MaLucia!"</p>
                  <p>Lucia did as she was bid—her eyes met Redgie's, as he stood hat in hand. The
                     carriage door slammed—Reginald bowed low—Lucia drove back to school, with her
                     head reeling and an unquiet heart. A new thought, a new impulse had insinuated
                     itself in her life—she had sprung in an hour from childhood to womanhood.
                     Nobody could warn her against Reginald now.</p>

                  <p>REGINALD went to his own lodging after he had put Lucia and Madame Bernard in
                     their carriage; sat down at his desk, lit a cigar, drew his writing materials
                     comparatively near the open window, and wrote several letters rapidly,
                     addressing some to New Orleans, some to New York, and one to Charleston. The
                     contents of the letters were pretty much all alike. They solicited certain
                     friends of his to make strict inquiry after an emigrant by the name of Edward
                     Montague, or a man called James Dodd—giving these friends the clews that Lucia
                     had been able to put in his hands; he urged on his friends persistence and
                     industry in this search, as the discovery of this person, Edward Montague, was
                     of "<emph>vital</emph>" importance to him. He folded, sealed his letters, and
                     ringing the bell despatched them to the post-office by a servant. "I will not
                     leave a stone unturned to unearth that fellow," thought he; then he thought of
                     Lucia—how good, and sweet, and lovely she was; and he dwelt, as lovers will, on
                     every little incident of that eventful day; every word, every movement, every
                     glance of hers from the first instant he beheld her until now; and he
                     remembered with an extatic throb of his pulse that she had at any rate not been
                     offended at the emotion he had been utterly powerless to repress in her
                     presence. He dreamed the old, old dream. Ever since the world began there has
                     been scarcely variation enough to make the description of it interesting to
                     third parties. And then he thought of Grace Sharp—his cheek burned. He felt
                     guilty in that quarter. He <emph>had</emph> trifled with that girl!</p>
                  <p>"I have been a confounded vain, silly ass!" he muttered. "This is a scrape, and
                     how the d—l I am to get out of it I don't see! If the girl had only a brother,
                     or somebody to defend her, I really would almost take a shot and be thankful.
                     If a man treated my sister so, I would kill him; but I do not love her enough
                     to marry her—especially now, since I caught that look from—from—"Una." Reginald
                     sat cogitating a long time, then springing from his chair, he walked with rapid
                     step up and down the room. The sun was getting low, when at length he paused in
                     his steady tramp, and glanced out of the window.</p>
                  <p>"Six o'clock! and I have to dine with Roskopff to-day!" A sudden idea seemed to
                     strike him—"By Jove! I never thought of that—I'll try it, though it is d—d mean
                     of me!"</p>
                  <p>Reginald took his hat and went out to his dinner.</p>
                  <p>As Grace sat surrounded by her usual train of adorers that evening, none of
                     them suspected how intensely she was being bored by them all. She dared not
                     give way to mégrims and fanciful indispositions, as many girls would have done
                     under similar circumstances. She knew that the people she was staying with
                     meant to give her what they called a chance "to better herself"—that is, to
                     make a wealthy marriage. They thought with her beauty, and a small advance of
                     means for toilettes, the orphan might do much better than enter on the long
                     weary life of governessing. But it was to be Quid pro quo—and Grace had to do
                     her part—a hard part it was to-night. Grace was not good—she was worldly, and
                     calculating, and manœuvring. She <emph>might</emph> have loved Reginald without
                     a cent. He was very attractive to her—but she <emph>did</emph> love Mr.
                     Laurie's heir as much as Reginald now. It was bitter, bitter—all the feeling
                     she was capable of had been drawn out towards Reginald, and he had deceived
                     her! Since this morning she knew it. Bah! it did not require words to tell how
                        <emph>he</emph> loved that insignificant little Lucia Dare! Grace was
                     conscious of being distrait, out of humor—she felt it needful to make
                     extraordinary effort to sustain with accustomed spirit the already drooping
                     ball of conversation. Her head ached, and her heart—what she had of a heart—it
                     was rather lymphatic; but it might have developed into better and fuller
                     vitality had she not been thrown so early in her career with a careless, cruel,
                     and towards her, heartless, selfish man—bled slowly, torpidly, but surely—drop
                     by drop the good tender impulses oozed out and turned into venom; and she was
                        <emph>so</emph> helpless, so totally at this man's mercy—scorn, indignation,
                     wounded pride, mortified vanity and regret rankled in her breast.—Would he dare
                     to come again? Would he? and yet if he did <emph>not!</emph> There was a weary,
                     suffering look about the beautiful curved mouth, a pained expression in the
                     violet-blue eyes that would have softened the soul of her bitterest enemy.
                     Grace was not good, but she suffered now.</p>
                  <p>Grace did not turn her head with her usual smile of welcome towards Reginald,
                     when he entered her salon at last. She bowed coldly, her face did not change
                     its haughty, pained expression; she had not yet acquired the perfect
                     self-command which intercourse with the world gives, and which good breeding
                     requires. There was still something of the child in her. Reginald bowed low, as
                     he stood before her, and begged permission to present "a friend" who had
                     accompanied him—the Russian Prince Roskopff. Grace had heard the name
                     before.</p>
                  <p>The prince was a fine-looking man, considerably advanced in years, but just now
                     the rage in Paris, on account of his wealth, his diamonds, and his splendid
                     menage. Reginald had persuaded him to accompany him "to see the most beautiful
                     American in Paris," and the prince had yielded, his curiosity considerably
                     excited by Reginald's enthusiastic descriptions. The slight melancholy she felt
                     added the only charm usually wanting to Grace's beauty, and Reginald saw with
                     delight that the prince was greatly struck with her appearance and manner—"ça
                     ira," he whispered to himself. The prince was a man of the world, had traveled
                     a good deal, and managed soon to interest Grace more in his conversation than
                     she would have supposed possible in the beginning of the evening; she saw in a
                     moment that he was épris of her, and she fully appreciated <emph>all</emph> the
                     advantages of such a parti; and she was glad to have it in her power to show
                     Reginald she did not intend to wear the willow for <emph>him</emph>—so Grace
                     was charming, because excited, brilliant. The prince was delighted; he thanked
                     Reginald again and again for the great pleasure he had given him in presenting
                     him to his "charming countrywoman." The prince was a connoisseur in beauty as
                     well as in diamonds, and he never had beheld any woman prettier than Grace
                     Sharp. He thought how well she would look with a diamond coronet! She was worth
                     as much as a Ruben's, only to look at! Recalling a ball engagement, however, he
                     was obliged, reluctantly, to take his leave. He went to the ball and raved
                     about "la belle Americaine" until he made Grace one of the sensations of Paris.
                     Reginald lingered until all the gentlemen had departed. After they had gone he
                     stood by a table turning over the leaves of a book of engravings, with an idle
                     hand, his eyes cast down thoughtfully; Grace sat erect and firm in her chair,
                     near the table—her face cold, fixed, hard as marble—she neither moved nor
                     noticed him. Reginald threw down the book impatiently, and came towards her
                     with outstretched hand:</p>
                  <p>"Will you say good-bye, Miss Grace? I start to-morrow for Constantinople, and
                     shall be absent, I don't know how long: 'It may be for years—it may be for
                     ever,' as Kathleen's lover sings."</p>
                  <p>Reginald tried to speak lightly, but his voice showed emotion.</p>
                  <p>Grace was not prepared for this. She was startled—her composure was shaken; but
                     with an effort, she recovered herself, gave him the tips of her fingers,
                     coldly, and said in a voice pride attempted to make steady: "Good-bye; I wish
                     you a pleasant tour, Mr. Laurie."</p>
                  <p>The effort was too great; as she spoke, two heavy, leaden tear-drops fell icy
                     cold on Reginald's hand as it grasped hers. He started as if they had burned
                     him; his face flushed crimson; but Grace was a proud woman. The tears had
                     fallen—she could not help that; but she looked at him with a stern, forbidding
                     glance, that checked the words of passionate self-accusation and bitter regret
                     that almost rushed from Reginald's lips—not that—not to that degree of ignominy
                     had she brought her womanhood. She dared—her look said it—she defied Reginald
                     Laurie to pity her, or to seem to understand <emph>why</emph> she suffered.</p>
                  <p>"I am not well to-night," she said; "the excitement of the wedding fatigued me.
                     Good-bye, Mr. Laurie; we have had some happy hours together. You recall the
                     song of Moore's; you have a good memory for songs—I like it better than
                     Kathleen's, that is so hackneyed. It is scarcely probable we shall meet again
                     in Paris, then. Shall I say 'au révoir,' looking forward to America?"</p>
                  <p>Reginald would have given worlds to have thrown himself on his knees at that
                     pained woman's feet, and to have said "forgive me;" but he dared not, he could
                     not trust himself to answer; he lifted her hand to his lips, left Grace, and as
                     he passed out of the door he heard a low, mocking, scornful laugh. It was the
                     laugh of a fiend in Reginald's ears. Grace sung the aria from the opera of Don
                     Giovanni: <q>

                  <head type="sub">LONDON.—THE SERPENT STRIKES ONCE.</head>
                  <p>A MONTH after Reginald's departure there was another grand wedding at the
                     American ambassador's. The ceremony was likewise repeated by a Russian Bishop,
                     with all the pomp of Greek ritual. On this occasion Miss Sharp became Madame La
                     Princesse Roskopff. Lucia, still at school, was not invited to the wedding.
                     Reginald was in Constantinople, just about to start on a pilgrimage to the Holy
                     Land, with a party of Englishmen he had encountered. His head was full of
                     camels and dragomen when the wedding cards were brought him from the American
                     ministry. They were beautiful cards, done up in silver paper, duly ornamented
                     with crest and coronet, and addressed to him in Grace's own hand-writing.</p>
                  <p>Redgie said, "thank God," and held them to the taper, near by from which he had
                     just lighted his Turkish pipe. He burnt them up and dismissed all care about
                     Grace from his mind with the curling smoke.</p>
                  <p>A few months afterwards Mr. Vail came to take Lucia back to England. Lucia
                        was<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6308-00000023"/> glad to go. She was now
                     eighteen, and "sweet as English air could make her." All her acquaintances had
                     left Paris. Lousie was in America; the Princess Roskopff in St. Petersburg.</p>
                  <p>Redgie traveled in the East that whole year. When he returned to Paris, the
                     ladies of the haute voleé declared he was much changed and wonderfully improved
                     both in manner and appearance. They admired especially his very long, silky,
                     blue-black beard. They said he was graver and very Oriental in manner. Redgie
                     liked his beard himself. It <emph>was</emph> becoming. He took a great deal of
                     care of it. He had learned some Arabic, and some repose in mind and manner. He
                     was not much sun-burned by the air of the desert; and dropped his pipe as soon
                     as he reached Paris, and returned to cigarettes, which showed that he still had
                     some of what Aristotle calls the sixth sense left him. He called upon his old
                     acquaintance, Madame Bernard. From her he learned that Miss Dare had returned
                     to her father's care.</p>
                  <p>Redgie had been traveling to escape from memory and from himself. But when he
                     was bathing in the Dead Sea he had thought of Lucia, and on the top of Mount
                     Sinai he had seen her face, and in the Holy City. Every where he was reminded
                     of her, particularly in reading the history of this country—every where,
                     instead of the faces of Godfrey, of Bouillon, and his daughter Sybilla; he
                     always saw Lucia Dare's, who he knew had some drops of their blood in her
                     veins. "Redgie" had some himself, but he did not know that just now. So he did
                     not find the river Lethe in Palestine, nor in Egypt either. He determined to go
                     home and seek it in America. It must be some where in the world. So Reginald
                     bade adieu to Paris and crossed over into England. He had some financial
                     business which detained him in London. His traveling friends, the Marquis of
                     H—, and Lord C—found him out. They insisted on his staying awhile. They took
                     him to their country seats; introduced him every where. They said "he was the
                     cleverest fellow they ever knew!" So Redgie became a small lion in London
                     society. They insisted Redgie should attend the Queen's drawing room, the first
                     of this season, to see the aristocracy assembled; and Redgie went. He stood,
                     with his friends, near the motley group of Americans under the keepership of
                     Mr. Dallas.</p>
                  <p>Redgie looked with admiration upon the brilliant assemblage;—many of the most
                     distinguished people of Great Britain were present. Peers and peeresses in full
                     court dress; stately men in uniform, and splendid women flashing with diamonds.
                     His friends pointed every body out to him that were worth noticing. Presently
                     there was a slight stir in the gorgeous crowd. The Queen in her ceremonious
                     progress down the apartment had stopped in front of a group—a young debutanté
                     was bending low over Victoria's hand. The Queen, attracted by the sweet
                     timidity and touching softness of the youthful face bowed before her, had bent
                     forward, lightly touched the sweet brow with her lips, saying aloud—</p>
                  <p>"Young lady, we know that you are motherless. The lady Sybilla was dear to us
                     in our girlhood—remember Victoria was your mother's friend!"</p>
                  <p>A murmur of approval buzzed through the crowd at this gracious and graceful
                     greeting of the beloved Queen; and all eyes turned on the debutante, who stood
                     blushing and overwhelmed with emotion between the lady who presented her—one of
                     the proudest duchesses of England—and the stately form of Sir Hugh Dare, who
                     looked more arrogant and haughty than ever.</p>
                  <p>Reginald felt a film pass over his eyes—one throb of joy at the
                     recognition—then rolled the sea of bitterness over his soul, as he realized
                     more than ever the utter hopelessness of his mad passion.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh withdrew his blushing, gratified child from the presence, with more
                     pride than he had ever felt towards his daughter in all her previous life.</p>
                  <p>Lucia did not observe Reginald; she was very timid, and scarcely lifted the
                     long eye lashes from her glowing cheeks. She passed close to Reginald as she
                     backed out of the royal circle. It smote on Reginald's heart that she had not
                     recognized him—though he knew himself to be perfectly unreasonable to expect
                     she should. It tortured him to see the glances of admiration cast on Lucia from
                     all sides. He could have gnashed his teeth.</p>
                  <p>"Grace, you are avenged already." This thought had scarcely darted through his
                     brain when the cortege of the Russian ambassador advanced towards the Queen.
                     Reginald saw among the suite the Prince and Princess Roskopff, both in Russian
                     court costume. How resplendently beautiful Grace looked! Her superb dress set
                     off her perfect form, and her arms and neck were dazzling with jewels,—while
                     the tall Russian head-dress, set with brilliants, made a halo in her long, dead
                     gold hair that was softened by the floating veil of white lace that hung from
                     her tall cap. It took away one's breath to look at her. She was dazzling.</p>
                  <p>"Beauty unadorned" is very well, but "beauty adorned" is better.</p>
                  <p>As she moved back after the presentation, she caught Reginald's eye fixed upon
                     her in undisguised admiration. A smile of triumph and gratified vanity broke
                     over her face like a sunburst, then a mocking, scornful look chased it away as
                     she glanced meaningly at him, then at the unconscious Lucia, who stood at a
                     short distance receiving the attentions of some of the first noblemen present.
                     Grace read Redgie's face very quickly, and she wanted him to <emph>see</emph>
                     that she <emph>did.</emph> Reginald quitted the drawing-room as soon as he
                     could. His heart was throbbing as if it would burst, and his brain on fire. He
                     felt rather desperate. He invited some young fast companions to dine. They went
                     off to Long's. They were very merry; Redgie gayest of all. He laughed, jested,
                     and drank in the most reckless, wild way; called for wine after wine; drank
                     till his companions were under the table, and he had barely ability to get to
                     his rooms. The next morning he woke up with a headache and raging fever; found
                     hock and soda of no avail; grew so much worse that he had at last to yield to
                     "his man," and send for Sir Henry Halford, who physicked him, forbade his
                     attempting to rise, and put him on toast and water for a week. Redgie felt as
                     if he wished his illness might be fatal,—that would end it all. But Atropos was
                     not yet ready to cut the thread of life for him. The Marquis of H—— and Lord
                     C—— came to him and nursed him as if he had been their brother. They had been
                     together nearly a year in the East. They were devoted to Redgie. They soon got
                     him upon his feet. They did everything to make his stay agreeable. They took
                     him to their club, threw open the closed portals of the West End for him.
                     Reginald was quite the fashion in the aristocratic mansions of England. It was
                     whispered about that his father was one of the wealthiest of Louisiana
                     planters. The Liverpool merchants reported his crop to be seven thousand bales
                     of cotton; that was a pretty good income even for England. Then Redgie was
                     excessively handsome, well mannered, had been brought up in the Church of
                     England, knew the liturgy, went regularly to St. Paul's,
                     Knightsbridge—altogether was civilized. He was charming, especially his long
                     blue-black beard and Southern moustache, which he did not wax, <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">à la</foreign> Napoleon, but wore according to the custom of
                     his own country, long and overshadowing his mouth. Reginald met Lucia. He was
                     presented to her at a dinner-party. She put out her hand, and looked up in his
                     face with her girlish simplicity. "You must come to see me <emph>now,</emph>
                     Mr. Laurie; we have not Madame Bernard to be afraid of, and I want to hear all
                     you can tell me of dearest Louise." Reginald was fortunate enough to make an
                     agreeable impression on Sir Hugh, who saw instantly a strong resemblance to the
                     lost Gerald. He invited Reginald to his house. Of course he availed himself of
                     the privilege of entree. He knew that he ought to hasten away from Lucia's
                     presence; but he lingered and lingered. Reginald met the Princess Roskopff at a
                     ball given by his friend, the Marquis of H——'s sister. He was standing alone,
                     after dancing with his hostess, wondering what could keep Miss Dare so late;
                     she had told him she expected to attend the ball, when he suddenly felt a light
                     touch upon his arm. He turned to meet the smiling face and <emph>both</emph>
                     extended hands of the Princess Roskopff. "Mr. Laurie, quel bonheur! Soyez le
                     Bienvenu! Did you find Constantinople so <emph>very</emph> charming?" What
                     could Redgie do but take both the fair hands which laid themselves so
                     confidingly in his, and, as he slightly touched them with his bearded lip, to
                     say:</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Madame, how good of you in your triumphs to remember so insignificant a
                     person as myself!"</p>
                  <p>Then, with the beautiful Grace leaning upon his arm, Redgie joined the crowd of
                     promenaders. Grace had learned a good deal by this time. She was easy, smooth,
                     soft as velvet. Reginald willingly fell into the position she seemed to desire
                     he should assume, of an early and valued acquaintance. But he did
                        <emph>not</emph> forget that flash of malicious joy he had caught from her
                     eyes on the morning of the Queen's drawing-room. He did not trust her. He knew
                     he had wounded her in a woman's most vulnerable point, vanity, and even
                     affection. He did not like the renewal of intimacy which she claimed with Lucia
                     Dare. He thought of it with an instinct of fear and superstition. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Hush, beating heart of Christabel,</l>
                           <l>Jesu Maria, shield her well!"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, he was very attentive to Madame Roskopff. Got her ices, fanned her,
                     laughed at her witty reminiscences of their Parisian acquaintances, was very
                     agreeable, indeed, until he saw Lucia Dare enter upon her father's arm. Then he
                     soon cleverly extricated himself from the Princess, and when she saw him again
                     he was whirling very gracefully in a deux temps with Miss Dare. Reginald danced
                     â ravir. Grace watched them, and her eyes closed half obliquely, in a reptilish
                     sort of way.</p>
                  <p>Lucia had never shared Louise's dislike of Grace. As dearly as she loved
                     Louise, she considered her prejudiced and unjust here, and therefore was
                     nothing loath, in the Sahara of her brilliant but lonely life, to accept
                     eagerly the proffer of Grace's friendship. She saw a good deal of Grace. Sir
                     Hugh was impressed by the brilliant Princess. Grace had a retentive memory—she
                     had self-reliance, was obtuse in feeling, and unscrupulous—she readily acquired
                     the light, frivolous gossip of 'society'—she was wise enough to entrust her
                     toilettes to her French maid—her husband was liberal to her, very vain of her
                     beauty, and even when he did not altogether approve of her conduct, was
                     unsuspicious and indulgent.</p>
                  <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6308-00000024"/>
                  <p>He bored Grace very much, she was inexpressibly weary of him—diamonds and all.
                     She was growing rather "fast," but was living still within the externals of
                     propriety. Grace's feelings towards Reginald were very varied. She hated him,
                     and would have given her right hand to be revenged on him; but, somehow, he
                     seemed to have escaped her—she could not reach him. She felt bitterly that she
                     was not, even now, indifferent to him. She saw him admired, praised, flattered,
                     sought after by the noblest—or those she regarded as such from her point of
                     view, as they were the most distinguished and fashionable people in her world.
                     He, Reginald Laurie, had received nem con the stamp of fashion, and passed as
                     purest gold in that mint whose dictum alone she valued as certifying to good
                     currency. Grace raged at him often for his treatment of her, and from the
                     depths of her heart she hated Lucia Dare! Yes, she hated, hated her—she would
                     have liked to have strangled her; but it was the nineteenth century after
                     Christ, so she neither put poison in her gloves, or roses, or cup, nor could
                     she have Lucia sewed up in a bag and dropped in the Thames. She only
                        <emph>devoted</emph> herself to Lucia—her old schoolmate, her dearest
                     friend. Grace was sentimental over Lucia, while she waited her hour to strike a
                     mortal blow if she could. Lucia believed in Grace, and thankfully received her
                     attentions. Reginald watched her closely, he had little faith in Grace.</p>

                              <p>DEAR LAURIE—In obedience to your request I have left "no stone
                                 unturned" to trace out "Edward Montague." or "James Dodd." I find
                                 such a man was sick in the Charity Hospital, near the time you say
                                 he would have probably arrived here, but can discover nothing but
                                 the bare register of the name on the list-book of the hospital. He
                                 is marked "Edward Montague, native England, aged seventeen, eyes
                                 and hair dark, ship-fever, very ill, August 8th, 1857." On another
                                 page—"Edward Montague, discharged, convalescent, October 5th,
                                 1857." At this point my most earnest inquiries have been baffled.
                                 Believe me, my dear Laurie, I have done all I could to gratify you
                                 and discover this man, and regret I can obtain no information more
                                 satisfactory than this to send you. Of James Dodd I can discover
                                 nothing."</p>
                           </div>

                  </q>
                  <p>The rest of the letter referred to private matters. Lucia was much affected
                     when Reginald showed her this letter. She was very grateful, and entreated him
                     not to abandon the search for Gerald. She told him she never allowed herself to
                     despair of finding him.</p>
                  <p>"I think it would kill me, Mr. Laurie! I cannot, <emph>will</emph> not give up
                     my brother. If all the world wearies of the vain search, I will go as soon as I
                     can—I will go and look for Gerald myself. I think I could find him—I think
                        <emph>I</emph> could!" She put her little hands together, and looked up with
                     such earnest, intense will and purpose in Reginald's face, that it startled
                     him. "This is not altogether silk floss, this gentle creature, there is a steel
                     spring hidden here!"</p>
                  <p>He respected her, but he <emph>could</emph> not love her more for the discovery
                     of this trait. It was very pleasant in those halcyon days of that gay London
                     season. Thrown thus constantly in society with Reginald, Grace yielded more and
                     more involuntarily to the old charm—his fascination in conversation, his
                     personal beauty, his suave courtesy towards all women. The half-consciousness
                     of guilt towards her, which softened his usual careless, easy manner, in his
                     intercourse with her, which made him seize eagerly and gratefully on the role
                     of friendliness and catch impatiently the olive branch she seemed to proffer
                     him. All these circumstances conspired to disarm Reginald, and to awaken anew
                     emotions that in Grace's slow but tenacious nature were only dormant, not dead.
                     The Prince, her husband, was in reality only a civilized barbarian, with all
                     his external splendor. He drank raw brandy to sottishness. Reginald was
                     charming when contrasted with <emph>him,</emph> and Grace acknowledged to
                     herself when contrasted with any of the men about her. If she could only get
                     rid of Lucia Dare! Grace deceived herself so much that she believed Lucia's
                     brilliant surroundings had more to do with Reginald's defalcation than Lucia's
                     personal attractions. Grace was the more beautiful woman, and she knew it. Far
                     more beautiful now that she too had all the adventitious aids of wealth, all
                     the prestige of rank, all the aplomb, the ease of a woman of fashion. Madame la
                     Princesse grew weary of Redgie's open devotion to Lucia Dare. She thought if
                     she could silently strike, so as to kill at once all hope, and rouse Reginald's
                     slumbering pride; if she could separate him at once and positively from Lucia
                     Dare, she might perhaps by well-feigned sympathy and cordial interest, bring
                     him back to her own feet. Was not half the London world already there? Was she
                     not the toast of the season? She wanted Sir Hugh to take his daughter away. She
                     was weary of being jealous, and of playing the devoted to Lucia Dare.</p>
                  <p>She took an opportunity to invite Sir Hugh, playfully, to a seat by her side,
                     one day at a party. In the most natural way in the world she managed to lead
                     the conversation towards Reginald, to her's and Lucia's school days in Paris,
                     where they had both first met Mr. Laurie. Reginald was sitting by Lucia at that
                     moment, absorbed in her; and she smiling, blushing, apparently very content
                     with her companion. Redgie was telling her of an exploring expedition he and
                     his companions had made in Idumea.</p>
                  <p>"In truth, Miss Dare, I had always an admiration for that noble, wronged,
                     supplanted Esau!"</p>
                  <p>"So have I, Mr. Laurie; I never liked Jacob!"</p>
                  <p>What need of declaration of love between those two? Their eyes made it every
                     minute they were together. Anybody could see it.</p>
                  <p>Grace spoke highly of Reginald; of his family, of his wealth, of his abilities,
                     but she said "Sir Hugh must pardon her the great interest she felt in dearest
                     Lucia; a motherless girl, so innocent, so trustful, perhaps made her
                     unnecessarily anxions—perhaps suspicious, intrusive. Mr. Laurie was exceedingly
                     fascinating, and of course ambitious. In his own country he had a right to be;
                     but here in England perhaps such pretensions were presumptuous. She understood
                     Sir Hugh had plans for dear Lucia,—at least the Duchess of A—— had suggested
                     the Earl of —— as an aspirant favored by Sir Hugh. This intimacy with Mr.
                     Laurie had begun in Paris. Did Sir Hugh think it altogether prudent?" Here
                     Grace stopped. "She was distressed, mortified, confused; perhaps she had
                     overstepped the boundary line of friendliness, but she was so fond of dear
                     Lucia, and had the dear motherless girl's interest at heart so much, that Sir
                     Hugh must excuse the liberty she took."Grace's eyes filled with tears in the
                     intensity of her sensibility. Sir Hugh glanced at the unconscious couple, the
                     subject of the Princess's kind observations, with a darkened, angry
                     countenance. He had never anticipated this. It <emph>was</emph> presumptuous in
                     this American to dare to think of his daughter. Lucia's future had all been
                     arranged long since in his own mind. When the time arrived he had intended to
                     inform her of her destiny; but he had not troubled himself to think if she he
                     regarded as a puppet to move according to his will, had any mind or will of her
                     own. If she had mind, so much the better; if heart, so much the worse; if will,
                     unless it chimed with his, it would have to break,—that was all. Again he
                     thanked the Princess for her "sensible, kindly warning," solicited the
                     continuance of her interest in Lucia, and concluded by saying, "Next year Lucia
                     will marry the Earl of M——, according to the agreement between his father the
                     Duke and myself. In the meantime I will see that she is led into no
                        <emph>romantic follies.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Grace was so sweet, so affectionate, all that evening to Lucia; so friendly to
                     Reginald.</p>
                  <p>The next morning Sir Hugh came into Lucia's boudoir. She was expecting a visit
                     from Reginald, had made a becoming toilette, and was sitting at the piano
                     singing from "Dinorah" the shadow song. Ah! she had heard it first the night
                     she met Reginald at the opera in Paris. Sir Hugh held a letter in his hand; he
                     handed it to her. It was postmarked New Orleans. It was from Louise. Lucia took
                     it with an exclamation of joy.</p>
                  <p>"Lucia," said her father, sternly, "this correspondence must cease entirely,
                     for the present. You will not reply to this nor any future letters you may
                     receive from your American friends. This intimacy must stop here. I have also
                     given orders that you are 'not at home' if Mr. Laurie should call. If you meet
                     him elsewhere you will be guarded in your manner. Already gossip is busy with
                     your name. Your manner is unbecoming my daughter, especially as you will look
                     upon the Earl of M——, from this day, in the light of your husband elect. The
                     preliminaries have already been discussed between his father the Duke and
                     myself. They will dine here to-day. Make preparations for your return to the
                     Hurst next week.</p>
                  <p>Without pausing for a reply from his astonished daughter, Sir Hugh left the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>Lucia sat transfixed. Grace's dart had gone to the centre. It was as good as
                     poison or the sack. One's victim lives and suffers long from mental or heart
                     wounds. It is agreeable to savages and to extremest civilization to
                        <emph>see</emph> victims writhe at the stake and <emph>not</emph> die.</p>
                  <p>Lucia heard the bell ring. She recognized Reginald's step, so light and
                     buoyant, his voice as he asked for her. She had an appointment with him this
                     morning. She heard the smooth, deceitful tones of Lyndsay as he replied
                     promptly, "Not at home." She listened to the lingering footfalls with which
                     Reginald turned away from the door, wondering at her absence, without a word of
                     apology, when she had herself made the appointment for this hour. She felt so
                     helpless, so fettered.</p>
                  <p>The door opened. The servant handed her, on a silver salver, a lovely little
                     bouquet of rarest flowers, with Reginald's card stuck in. As soon as the
                     servant withdrew, Lucia seized the flowers, pressed them to her lips, and, with
                     an exclamation of despair, she threw herself on a sofa and burst into a fit of
                     wild weeping,—such tears as she had wept over Gerald, only bitterer. "He robs
                     me of all," she moaned. "Gerald, Reginald—even of my own liberty. I am crushed
                     like a worm. O, God! have you no mercy, no pity, for a poor helpless child like
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>Reginald called again that evening; again the next day, and again; still the
                     same answer. Lucia was not ill. The Morning Post described dinners,-soirées at
                     Sir Hugh<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6308-00000025"/> Dare's nearly every day.
                     Redgie was wretched. His friend, the Marquis of H——, saw it. "Laurie," said he,
                     "I feel obliged to tell you something I was forced to hear the other day. I was
                     wedged between the deaf Duchess of —— and Mrs. N——, just back of a sofa upon
                     which Sir Hugh Dare and the Princess Roskopff were sitting. I heard their
                     conversation in spite of myself. I feel you ought to know the good turn the
                     amiable Princess has done you."</p>
                  <p>Then the Marquis told Reginald what he heard.</p>
                  <p>Reginald went to see the Princess. She received him with <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">empressement.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Have you seen Miss Dare lately, Madame?" inquired Reginald, after the usual
                     salutations.</p>
                  <p>Grace's eyes flashed—the same malignant flash he had beheld once before in
                     those violet orbs.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! I saw her to-day. She is about to quit London. Parliament is up. Sir
                     Hugh announces her engagement to the Earl of M—. Did you hear of it?"</p>
                  <p>Grace trifled with her fan—her rings, of which she wore too many, sparkled on
                     her fingers. Reginald looked steadily at her: he read her soul with that fixed,
                     keen gaze.</p>
                  <p>"I saw the announcement in the Post this morning," he said slowly. "You are
                     very skillful, Madame, and relentless; one must admire your abilities—but,
                     perhaps it is just as well. I knew the dream was a mad one. It has been a long
                     and a pleasing one. I never had any pretensions—it was only a joy to be near
                     HER. I shall sail for America to-morrow, bearing with me at least the
                     remembrance of the only woman I have ever known who was to me my ideal of
                     perfect womanhood. I hope, though a sadder, I may be a better man for having
                     known and dared to love Lucia Dare! I pray God to bless her wherever she may
                     be. Will you tell her this from me? Farewell, Madame la Princesse!"</p>
                  <p>He rose and went towards the door—Grace sprang after him with clasped hands and
                     agonized face.</p>
                  <p>"Don't go! Reginald! Don't quit me in anger! don't be so cruel—so hard—listen
                     to me! Lucia Dare could never—never love you as I did, as I do! You loved me
                     once."</p>
                  <p>"Never!" The word came stern and full from Reginald's lips. He closed the door
                     after him. Grace fainted on the floor.</p>
                  <p>The next day Reginald sailed. He did not attempt to see Lucia or to communicate
                     with her. He knew he would only expose her to persecution by doing so—he loved
                     her too well for that. His friends promised to spend the next winter with him
                     hunting in the South.</p>
                  <p>"Our life on plantations is not unlike your country-seat life," said Reginald,
                     as he shook hands with them. "We have fine sport on our lakes and in our
                     forests. You will receive 'cead mille failthe' when you come from all my
                     clan."</p>
                  <p>A year passed quietly at the Hurst. Lucia was not yet married. She had long
                     ceased to hear from America. Louise wrote no more. Finding letter after letter
                     remained unanswered, she ceased to write to Lucia.</p>
                  <p>Louise lived on her husband's plantation in one of the upper parishes of
                     Louisiana.</p>
                  <p>Reginald was living in Natchez, practising law. He saw Louise rarely; when he
                     did, he never spoke of Lucia. He supposed she had married long are this.</p>
                  <p>Reginald devoted himself to his profession. He worked very hard. He was very
                     unsociable, the young ladies of Natchez said. He declared "he had not time to
                     visit much." He received the London Times regularly, and some European papers.
                     He frequently saw notices in them of the beautiful Princess Roskopff—a belle at
                     Baden-Baden; and in Paris Grace had a brilliant lot. She made the
                        <emph>most,</emph> not the best—perhaps the <emph>worst</emph> of it. Her
                     name was already in men's mouths; her reputation taut soit pen fleétrie! Grace
                     had no faith in man, nor woman, nor in God! Reginald Laurie began the work of
                     destruction in her moral nature—selfishness and vanity finished it!</p>

                  <p>THERE is not in the world an institution better managed than the Charity
                     Hospital in New Orleans. It was established in 1784 by Don Andrez Almonaster J.
                     Rogas. He gave $114,000 for this purpose. It was enlarged by Aranprez in 1793,
                     who made a bequest to it—again, 1811, Michallo Almonaster presented it with an
                     endowment, and turned over the whole of the establishment to the city of New
                     Orleans. It is an immense building, three stories high, surrounded by pretty
                     gardens. It is managed by a Council of Administrators, chosen by the Governor
                     of the State, and the Senate, who is elected for one year. The most eminent
                     physicians and surgeons attend the sick here without charge. It is under the
                     supervision of twenty Sisters of Charity of the order of St. Joseph, who reside
                     in a wing of the hospital.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Rock stood at the head of his profession. He ranked as the first surgeon in
                     the South. Passionately interested in the study of anatomy, he had spent the
                     best portion of a long life, and devoted the whole powers of his colossal mind,
                     with the vim of an indomitable will, to the mastery and perfecting of this
                     science. He would often say to the medical students who flocked, pencil and
                     note book in hand, to listen to the able lectures he would sometimes deliver
                     from the chair of the medical college:</p>
                  <p>"Young gentlemen: this branch of science is a jealous mistress; she requires
                     your entire, your absorbed devotion: for her sake you must abandon all
                     others—no time for dallying with lighter studies; no time for belles lettres or
                     polite languages. Every moment spent away is labor lost. If you are not going
                     to work and study with this intensity, don't come here to me. I am always in
                     earnest myself, and I want only earnest men about me."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Rock was a colossus in size as well as in mind—very tall, stout and brawny:
                     a man of tremendous physique—he was powerful and strong as an ox; his hands had
                     the grasp of a vice. His features were rugged but well proportioned, and would
                     have been handsome—perhaps were in early youth, before, by some accident, he
                     had lost the sight of one eye, which disfigured him to some extent; but there
                     was something Titanic about the man—you felt he was "a power" in the world, as
                     transcendentalists would say. He walked with the tread of a giant. A patient
                     succumbed immediately as soon as Dr. Rock took hold of him. What was the use of
                     struggling in such a grasp as that? One might as well give up gracefully and
                     have one's arm or one's leg cut off without any fuss! One recognized the
                     futility of contest with such a will or such a man—and one had also an
                     involuntary feeling of confidence and repose in that huge-learned, self-poised,
                     self-reliant man. It was known that he used the knife as rarely as possible.
                     And though he was so big and so rough sometimes, it was only an assumed cover
                     to hide a very—an unusually soft and tender heart, buried in the midst of that
                     vast mass of flesh and bones. The bark of the strong, knotted tree concealing
                     the pure, sweet pith!</p>
                  <p>Patients soon discovered this quality in Dr. Rock, though well people almost
                     feared the abrupt, hasty, arbitrary surgeon-king. He had struggled up through
                     adverse circumstances by the simple force of will, power of genius, and
                     assiduity. Like most great men, being self-made, he had much sympathy with
                     struggling talent. He would aid it wherever he found it with his purse or
                     advice. He liked to tell how he split rocks on a railroad at three cents a foot
                     to get money to buy books—books that were more than meat or drink to him, while
                     his mother eked out a poor living, sewing for twenty-five cents a day I—But he
                     lived to reward her—for "a mother's love is repaid by one's kisses, by one's
                     talents, by one's successes; a good action is her sweetest reward; a noble
                     sentiment will light her brow with pride. The world honors her, and God blesses
                     her in<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6308-00000026"/> her child's qualities." Rock's
                     mother was certainly to be numbered amongst happy women!</p>
                  <p>He was a great man and a good man, in spite of some anacreontic sympathies; and
                     many people loved him—especially his <emph>poor</emph> patients, such as he had
                     at the charity hospital. He could have made the grand reply that the court
                     physician did to the Queen of France, when she was urging him to attend closely
                     to the Dauphin, then sick of a fever:</p>
                  <p>"Madame, he receives the same attention as if he were the son of a poor
                     peasant."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Rock used to scold his rich patients and frighten them. He said "half the
                     time there was nothing the matter with them but too much prosperity. They ate
                     too much, and drank too much, and did too little." But he was gentle as a big
                     lamb to his poor patients. His loves were strong, and his prejudices equally
                     so; and he had some whimsies too.</p>
                  <p>It was his hour for walking through the wards, attended by a crowd of students,
                     who laughed at him, quizzed him among themselves, but listened intently to
                     every word from his lips, as if they were golden sentences. He walked slowly
                     through the ward, examining with quick, professional eye every symptom,
                     explaining each case in a few concise terms, to the admiring students, who
                     loved to follow his masterly outlines, giving them suggestions for study during
                     many hours, in a few brief sententious phrases. Stopping by a bed in one corner
                     of the men's ward, he said: "This has been a severe case of complicated ship
                     and yellow fever; this poor fellow has had a tough time to get through; but is
                     safely over the crisis now, I think; though so weak he does not feel much
                     better yet. How are you this morning, Montague?" taking up the feeble, wasted
                     hand lying out on the cool, clean linen sheet, and clasping it in his own huge
                     fingers—"how are you, my poor boy?"</p>
                  <p>The patient smiled feebly, and whispered, "Better."</p>
                  <p>The doctor looked at him, while an emotion of pity flew over his granite
                     features:</p>
                  <p>"You have had a rough time, young man; but I hope you are 'out of the woods.' I
                     will see you again after a while."</p>
                  <p>The doctor with his train walked on to the next bed. The patient he left turned
                     himself over on to the side of the bed, with a weary sigh. He was very young,
                     had a noble face, with jet black eyes and hair, and a slight, dark moustache.
                     His eyes were closed now, to keep the light out, but they were tremulous from
                     weakness, and his feeble, white hands, that looked as if they had not been
                     accustomed to manual labor, were clasped together as he lay supine and
                     helpless. One of the Sisters approached him with some weak brandy and water,
                     touched him gently and put a spoonful in his dry, parched lips:</p>
                  <p>"You are better, my brother?" she inquired gently.</p>
                  <p>The boy—he was scarcely more, looked up in the calm, serene face, clothed in
                     the cap of her order, which bent over him, and tears of gratitude welled from
                     his dark eyes, and stole slowly down his cheeks. The Sister wiped them off with
                     a napkin, and saying, "You must not agitate yourself; you are too weak," she
                     gave him another spoonful of the liquor and left him, to pursue her task of
                     mercy at the other couches. After Dr. Rock had gone through the wards with his
                     pupils, he dismissed them, and returned alone to the bed of the youth. Taking
                     his hand, he placed his fingers on the wrist, felt his pulse, then laid it
                     gently down again.</p>
                  <p>"You are so kind, doctor," whispered the poor youth.</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw! That's my business—half of <emph>your</emph> illness is mental! Who are
                     you, boy? What are you doing here? This is no place for you; you are not an
                     ordinary emigrant. How did you get here?"</p>
                  <p>Montague fixed his dark eyes on the surgeon with an inquiring, troubled
                     expression:</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, in my delirium, did I say any thing that was suspicious or
                     strange?"</p>
                  <p>"You said a vast deal that was 'suspicious and strange,' boy; raved about a
                     'Lucia,' and about 'papa.' Did you have an unhappy home from which you have run
                     away?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>The doctor nodded his head, "That's right. Tell me the truth; when you are
                     strong enough tell me the whole story. It is a good thing some times for boys
                     to run away. If they have too easy a time and too much money—it sometimes makes
                     men of them to be thrown on their own resources, and sometimes it sends them to
                     the devil. Don't go there, young man, or I shall regret I saved your life! In
                     the meantime, you are poor now, I suppose, or you wouldn't be here. You haven't
                     always been. Those soft, white hands never worked for a living, as mine did.
                     You have good muscle, but it has not been developed yet. You will never get
                     well here; the air is too close, and low, and damp. It is swamp air—good enough
                     of its kind, but bad for you. You will sink into typhoid if you stay here—and I
                     have had enough of you. There is no use to waste any more good brandy on you,
                     as I have done. It stimulates; but you want air, rest, nutrition. I am going to
                     send you where you will get well so fast, you will eat three dozen oysters at a
                     breakfast. I shall give you some money and send you over to Pass Christian—to
                     the sea-shore. It is not far off; you can get board cheap there, at some
                     fisherman's cottage, and you will get well directly. Then you can work, or—go
                     back to your friends."</p>
                  <p>Montague shook his head.</p>
                  <p>"No! the case is serious then! Well, you'll get some work, and when you are
                     able you'll pay me back my money. I never give money to people who can make it
                     for themselves; there are too many really poor people in the world, and I can't
                     afford it. You are young; you will soon be strong again, and I shall expect you
                     to pay me back my money! D'ye hear?" bawled the doctor, savagely.</p>
                  <p>Montague smiled; creeping his feeble fingers along the bed, he got hold of Dr.
                     Rock's huge hand as he leaned on the bed, and before Dr. Rock could prevent it,
                     he had pressed it to his fever-parched lips, and a bright tear had moistened
                     it, from his grateful, wet eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor absolutely blushed, and said roughly:</p>
                  <p>"Don't be a fool, and don't cry like a baby." And then hastily contradicted his
                     ascerbity by drawing out his own pocket-handkerchief and applying it to his own
                     eyes, afterwards blowing his nose, like a great old whale as he was.</p>
                  <p>"Doctor," whispered Montague, "I am greatly obliged to you; but I think you
                     could get me some money on these." He put his hand under his pillow and drew
                     out his pocket-book, and put it in Doctor Rock's hands. It was a costly
                     pocket-book, mounted with gold, a crest and coronet in the centre of the
                     binding, and the initials G. V. D. around it.</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" said the Doctor, casting a searching glance on the young face. "Noble!
                     I thought so from your fine linen, your accent, your English, and your whole
                     aspect. You are too young and look too innocent to have been guilty of great
                     crime. What have you been after, boy?" The Doctor opened the book, found three
                     English sovereigns, a small watch studded with the same initials as the
                     pocket-book, in very rare, large brilliants, and a set of shirt-studs and
                     sleeve-buttons of very fine solitaire diamonds.</p>
                  <p>"Can't you get me some money for them?" whispered Montague.</p>
                  <p>"I suppose I could," replied the Doctor, looking at him thoughtfully. "These
                     are truly yours?"</p>
                  <p>"Truly mine, given me by my—" Montague covered his face with his hands, and
                     tears streamed out between the long thin fingers. "My—my sister!"</p>
                  <p>"Boy, boy, you must not exhaust yourself. Stop crying and listen to me. These
                     things, I suppose, are valuable, and may be of inestimable price to you some
                     day. I shall take them to a jeweler and have them appraised. Then I will keep
                     them, advancing the money on them myself, so if you should need them at any
                     time, you know where to come for them. Your sister gave them to you. I never
                     had a sister. I wish I had had; it would have made me a better man, may be.
                     Remember that you have one, and keep your life clean; some day you will want to
                     go back to her. I will attend to this to-day, for I want you to get away
                     to-morrow if you can,—the sooner the better. Have you any clothes?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir; I have a friend who will be here to-night to see me who has my
                     clothes. He will go with me, I expect."</p>
                  <p>"Who? That red-headed fellow, who thinks he talks English, I found crying over
                     you several nights when you were so sick?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir; he comes every night. Poor Jim!"</p>
                  <p>"What does he do during the day?"</p>
                  <p>"He has been working as a stevedore on the levee. We came from England
                     together. We had a little money, but I was not accustomed to exposure. I tried
                     it, too, working with Jim; but I fell sick, and Jim spent nearly all the money
                     we had for me. I grew worse, and the people of the house we were lodging in
                     sent me here one day while I was delirious. It was several days before poor Jim
                     could find me, or get the people to say where I had been taken to. At last he
                     found me. I should have died but for you and the good Sisters, Doctor
                     Rock."</p>
                  <p>"Of course I think you would. But I have work to do; I must go. Plenty of sick
                     people in the world besides one run-away English boy. I'll see you again
                     tonight if possible. Go to sleep." The Doctor growled out this last command in
                     his deepest, gruffest tones.</p>
                  <p>Montague closed his eyes instantaneously at the imperious mandate, and Dr. Rock
                     stalked titanically out of the vast room. Montague did not dare to open his
                     eyes again, and the gentle Sister of Charity, making her round of visitation a
                     short time afterwards, found him sleeping sweetly as a little tired child.</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow! so young and so beautiful, and apparently without friends! Holy
                     Mary, mother of God, pity and protect him with thy powerful intercession!"
                     muttered the Sister, drawing the coverlet over the slender hands.</p>
                  <p>It was clear and bright the next day. Doctor Rock came to the hospital at an
                     early hour. He found "Jim," as Montague called him, already awaiting his advent
                     by Montague's bed. Montague was neatly dressed, his clothes a little worn, but
                     exceedingly fine in material and fashionable in style and make. There was no
                     mistaking him,—he looked every inch a fine, patrician gentleman; the
                     aristocratic blood<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6308-00000027"/> in his veins told
                     in every trait of his face, in every outline of his body.</p>
                  <p>"Humph!" said Doctor Rock, "pretty looking frame to make a stevedore out of!
                     Don't wonder you got sick. Now, you look more like one," turning abruptly to
                     the astonished "Jim." "Jim" did look more like it. A strong, broad-shouldered,
                     sturdy, red-haired Anglo Saxon youth, with hands as hard and red as a
                     coal-heavers. "Jim" did not know what else to do, so he took the Doctor's
                     remark in a complimentary sense, and, pulling his shock hair, Jim made an
                     awkward bow. Montague laughed merrily, the Doctor's eyes twinkled. "Come, now,
                     that is the best sound I have heard out of your mouth for three weeks," said
                     he, patting Montague's shoulder, like a kind bear. "I think you'll do finely.
                     How are we to get him to the carriage, Jim, or Jack, whichever your name may
                     be?"</p>
                  <p>"Jim, your honor," replied the individual addressed. "Indeed, sir, I could just
                     pick up Master Ge—I mean Montague, myself, and carry him in my arms, if you
                     think it best. He ain't no weight now, to speak of; but perhaps he moutn't like
                     that, so I have got another man waitin' out yonder. We'll just put him in this
                     'ere chair, and carry him as easy as in a mine bucket."</p>
                  <p>"Umph! So you have worked in mines, have you?" said Doctor Rock, catching at a
                     word. "Well, call in your reserve. Time wanes, and mine is precious. Let's
                     march."</p>
                  <p>Jim went off after "his man"; Doctor Rock pulled out his pocket-book and handed
                     Montague two thousand dollars in banknotes.</p>
                  <p>"This is what Hyde and Goodrich appraised your diamonds at, Montague. Take care
                     of it. When you get strong, get something better to do than working on the
                     levee loading ships. Let me hear from you when you want your watch and jewels;
                     bring me the money and you shall have them. Pretty business I have got into,
                     turning pawn-broker at my time of life! Here, Jim, pick him up and be off."</p>
                  <p>Jim, who had returned with his rein forcement, picked Montague up, who was
                     surprised to find himself so tremulous, and that he had little use of his legs.
                     Jim sat him down in the chair, the two men picked it up, and conveyed Montague
                     down the long ward, out through the galleries and halls, to the carriage which
                     stood before the door. Doctor Rock handed Montague a small box. "Here, take a
                     quinine pill every morning for a week; good bye." Doctor Rock nodded his head,
                     Jim, paid the man for his assistance, and cautioning the driver to go slowly
                     and carefully, Jim ensconced himself in the carriage, and they trotted off on
                     the shell road down to the lake, where they were to take the boat.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Rock looked after the carriage for an instant. "Foolish boy! Has a good
                     face, though. Will learn by experience." Then turned back to his self-imposed
                     duties in the hospital, which soon drove out of <emph>his</emph> head all
                     thought of Montague, or anything else but the work he had in hand.</p>
                  <p>The ride was fatiguing, but Montague felt the powers of recuperation awakening
                     as he bowled along on the smooth shell road; and when he tottered into his
                     stateroom, he recognized the great wisdom of Doctor Rock.</p>
                  <p>"The ole Doctor said as how you was to take a quinine pill an' a mint julep
                     soon as you got on board, an' eat a cracker; so here they are, Master Gerald,"
                     said Jim, coming in with a waiter in his hand.</p>
                  <p>Oh! how grateful and cooling the iced drink was! Montague swallowed it with
                     delight, after gulping down the pill. Then he lay back, already invigorated, in
                     his berth, looking vaguely out on the open lake, over which the boat was
                     speeding. The door was ajar which led out on the guards—Jim sat by him, on a
                     round four-legged stool. Jim looked at the thin, boyish face lying on the
                     pillow, nearly as white as the linen it rested upon, and running his hand
                     through his red hair, till it stood up in a straight heap over his head, Jim
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"Master Gerald, we haven't made such a good start as we expected to, have
                     we?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Jim, we haven't; but when I get well we'll do better. I have some money
                     now. I shall give you half of it to buy those drays and horses you were talking
                     about; that will give you a start. As for me, I will try to get in a store, or
                     merchant's office; I write a good hand, and am pretty well educated for a boy
                     of my age; I have no doubt I can get something to do in-doors—I am willing, but
                     I am afraid I can't stand out-door work like you."</p>
                  <p>"It stands to reason you couldn't, Master Gerald," continued Jim, in a low
                     voice, speaking with hesitation. "Don't you think you had better go back
                     home?"</p>
                  <p>Montague or Gerald started.</p>
                  <p>"No, Jim, never!" said he, vehemently; "not until! I am of age, and my own
                     master by the law. I will never go back—never while my father lives." His face
                     kindled and his eyes blazed. "Jim, I <emph>can't</emph> go back. Do you think I
                     would have come away to go back like a whipped bound, because I find life is
                     not all play, and it is not so easy to make my bread as I thought! Put that out
                     of your head, Jim; I am not going back; but, oh, Jim, I would give all the
                     world to see my sister, or to hear from her!"</p>
                  <p>"Well! why don't you write to Miss Lucia?"</p>
                  <p>"I can't yet, it would betray me; but when I can I will. Do you write to your
                     people, Jim?"</p>
                  <p>"No, Master Gerald; there's nobody to mind me but Mary, an' she's married; not
                     much of a scholar neither, and I was feared if they knowed where I was, they'd
                     suspicion you were not far off, so I ain't writ none. There's Lizzie Green, a
                     girl at the miner's village at Goodalls; I would like to hear summat about her;
                     but she's a pretty girl, and most probable some other feller is after her afore
                     this; she won't mind me long, I'm thinkin'."</p>
                  <p>Jim spoke rather ruefully of the probable desertion of his youthful love.
                     Gerald looked at him.</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry for it, Jim."</p>
                  <p>"It don't matter, Master Gerald; wimen is whimsical, any how—like as not Lizzie
                     would have flung me over, after all. There was a chap at the mines, a sort of
                     overlooker, always hangin' about her, and makin' soft speeches to her. It is my
                     opinion Lizzie would have flung me over."</p>
                  <p>Jim reiterated this doggedly, as if he was resolved to crush out all lingering
                     hope in his love-pierced heart.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Gerald, "buy your drays Jim; make a fortune, as you say you will,
                     and go over and see if Lizzie has remembered you or no. That will be best."</p>
                  <p>Jim's face cleared up.</p>
                  <p>"That's a good thought, Master Gerald, an' it will be a good way of tryin'
                     Lizzie. If she waits an' is true to a feller for a year or so she'll prove
                     'faithful unto death.'"</p>
                  <p>Jim read this legend on the interior of a huge gold ring he took off his middle
                     finger. Gerald held out his hand and took it to look at.</p>
                  <p>"Did Lizzie give you this, Jim?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Master Gerald, she give me that the night before I left, and I give her
                     one with a blue stone in it, that she promised to wear to her dying day."</p>
                  <p>"I expect she will do it Jim," said Gerald, seriously. Gerald was too young to
                     doubt woman's truth—yet his confidence in Lizzie confirmed Jim in his trust in
                     her fidelity, and he became quite joyous and bright in consequence. He began to
                     talk of the particular drays and horses he wished to buy, and the money he
                     hoped to make with them. Gerald listened with the languid, amused interest of a
                     convalescent. At length he said: "Jim, I want to consult you about something.
                     You know I left England under the name of Edward Montague. Well, I don't like
                     that altogether, and think it best to baffle all inquiry by changing it. I
                     think I will call myself after my mother and sister, 'Lucian Courtenay;' I have
                     more right to that, and will like it better."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, Master Gerald; I haven't got used to the Montague, no how, as yet,
                     and I think the 'Courtenay' would come more nateral like, seein I have heard my
                     feyther talk so often of my lady by her own name. An' if it's just the same to
                     you, Master Gerald, I think I'll change my name, too, for these 'Mericans. A
                     man as come over in the ship with us, said as how there warn't no sich name as
                     Jeames; that it was naught but Jacob in Greek. These ere 'Mericans might have
                     that fancy too, an' a man likes to have a name as is a name. Jim is surely a
                     name in England, 'cause I've heard the rector, Mr. Devere, read it out a
                     Scripter; but if it 'taint in the Greek or 'Merican Scripter, it would make a
                     man feel sort o' bad to have fun poked at him. So, if you please, I'll call
                     mysen Jacob Doddson. Then I'll make a fortin' with them ere drays—go back an'
                     see Lizzie, an' if she's true it is Jacob Doddson will find it out, and Jim
                     Dodd that'll marry her sure, in blessed ole England."</p>
                  <p>Gerald laughed at Jim's romance, but he entered into the plan quite heartily.
                     After discussing the future like boys, in every impracticable view, he
                     complained of weariness. The quinine made his head buzz; so he turned over and
                     fell asleep, lulled by the motion of the boat, fanned by the pure sea-breeze.
                     "Jacob Doddson" stretched himself on the floor, made a pillow of his stool,
                     turned down on the floor, and followed his example.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE FISHERMAN'S COTTAGE.</head>
                  <p>"LUCIAN COURTENAY," as our hero now resolved to dubb himself, found no
                     difficulty in securing board and lodging at a reasonable rate, in the family of
                     Baptiste, the fisherman, who lived in a one-story frame cottage, a mile beyond
                     the village of Pass Christian. The fisherman had not been married many months;
                     his simple cottage was in all the freshness of bridal whitewashings, and the
                     four low rooms opening into the narrow, uninclosed passage-way which divided
                     the centre of the house, were as clean as "new brooms" could make them. The
                     house had long, unceiled, picturesque, though rough galleries back and front.
                     The young wife was a bright, active, industrious little body, kept every thing
                     neat and trig about her; so Lucian found himself very well off under her wing,
                     for she, woman-like, was interested on sight, in the pale, weak, emaciated
                     youth, "who must be so handsome when in health," she remarked to her husband,
                     privately. "Jacob Doddson" made the arrangements, having gone out on a lodging
                     exploration, while Lucian was resting at the hotel, the day of their arrival at
                     the Pass. Jacob was attracted by the neat little cottage, with its galleries
                     shaded by<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6308-00000028"/> grape trees in full cluster,
                     for Baptiste the fisherman grew a considerable vine-yard in addition to
                     pursuing the fishing and oyster trade. His market for all his products being
                     New Orleans, he made a very decent living by his honest industry; but Marie,
                     his little wife, was just now in want of a good many dainty articles, he
                     thought, being rather under the weather in health, though stronger and brighter
                     in hopes and fond womanly anticipations of the stranger that a few months might
                     bring to their humble fireside; so he was glad when Jacob Doddson proposed his
                     receiving Lucian as a lodger for a few weeks—"a real gentleman," Jacob said,
                     "an' easy to please; all he wanted a clean, quiet room, and plain fare, he
                     would give but little trouble." Honest Baptiste agreed that Lucian should come
                     immediately. Owing to Jacob's energy, an hour had not elapsed before Lucian was
                     installed in the possession of his whitewashed apartment. Very clean it looked,
                     snow-white cotton curtains with knotted fringes, to his windows and around his
                     bed; a deal table set off with a white cover; the pedestal of a large, white
                     China bowl and pitcher, a big, red stone jug of fresh water at its foot, a
                     rocking-chair with a rush bottom to it, another small table with another white
                     cover, set close to the wall, boasting a modest square mirror in a slight
                     standing frame, with a little drawer for brushes and combs; on a shelf, set up
                     like a bracket, a common clock ticked away merrily; the floor was carpetless,
                     but polished and shining from being rubbed with sand and water, and scrubbed
                     with a piece of palmetto root. It had a pretty pink stain from the use of China
                     leaves, which were always rubbed over it, as a finishing touch of elegance.</p>
                  <p>It was all cool, and sweet, and fresh. The sunshine made the low crests of the
                     waves sparkle as they rolled with playful splashes on the shelving sands of the
                     shore. The sea-breeze waved the tendrils and leaves of the vine overshadowing
                     the gallery on which the door of the room opened Lucian was delighted with the
                     aspect of all around him; he lay, after Jim had quitted him, on his snowy,
                     coarse, white, linen-covered bed, in a blissful condition of dreamy
                     semi-consciousness, listening, half-slumbering in the pleasant weakness of a
                     convalescent to Marie's singing of a hymn to the Virgin, as she busied herself
                     over her ironing-table, in the room opposite his. She was "doing up" some
                     little garments of soft, white jaconet with extraordinary rufflings and
                     flutings, that she intended to add to the contents of a small trunk, slipped
                     under her bed, already more than half-filled with what honest Baptiste regarded
                     as most wonderful Lilliputian dresses, diminutive shirts, petticoats a yard
                     long, with such disproportioned bits of waists, fastened by drawing-strings,
                     and tiny shoulder-straps of narrow tape over arm-holes, that made Baptiste
                     laugh to poke his big, red fingers through, as he would hang them on his two
                     huge thumbs, and surveying his bright little wife's handiwork, when he came
                     home sometimes at night, and found her busy with her needle; but Marie said
                     with assured confidence, "they were quite large enough," and of course Marie
                     knew best. So Lucian lay listening vaguely to Marie's voice, softened by her
                     sweet, happy thoughts, as she chanted with the swelling heart of a young,
                     hopeful, loving woman, her plaintive appeal to the most loving, the most
                     favored, and the most afflicted mother that the world has ever known—"Stabat
                     mater dolorosa juxta crucem lacrymosa, dum pendebat filius."</p>
                  <p>The sun had gone down—the brief twilight of southern latitudes was nearly
                     passed into the darkness of night, when Lucian woke out of his refreshing
                     slumber. He rose from his bed where he had been lying with his clothes on, and
                     supporting his feeble, tottering steps by the wall, managed to get out on the
                     gallery, and sink weakly down in a chair he found opportunely near him. It was
                     lovely, out there—the moon just rising full and round, poured a flood of
                     quivering rays, through the interstices of the grape vine carefully trained on
                     lattice-work around the humble porch. The Gulf lay spread out before him, a
                     vast expanse of glittering waters—the long, low waves running—chasing each
                     other, before the cool sigh of the night wind—the sweet South wind, with its
                     moist wings. "Madidis Notus evolat alis." Stars came twinkling, one after
                     another, thick upon the dark, blue concave of the sky: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Peliads and Hyads and Orion's might,</l>
                           <l>And Arctos, called the wain, who wheels on high</l>
                           <l>His circling course, and on Orion waits;</l>
                           <l>Sole star, that never bathes in ocean wave!"</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not far off from the cottage, close on the brink of the suddenly descending
                     crest of the ridge of shore, stood an enormous live-oak tree, its branches
                     creaking gently under the impelling breeze, making long, changeful, waving
                     shadows on the smooth white sand so lightly covered with marine herbage. Half
                     the huge roots of this giant tree next the sea were bare and denuded of earth,
                     projecting out from the ridge in most fantastic mode, offering rustic seats,
                     with comfortable supporters for back and arms, looking towards the watery
                     plain.</p>
                  <p>Marie heard the feeble movements of the new inmate of her house. In a short
                     time she came out to where he was sitting, leaning his weary head on his hand.
                     Marie bore a small wooden tray in her hands, containing a china cup of steaming
                     hot café au lait, and a slice of bread, carefully spread with fragrant butter.
                     She offered this to Lucian, saying, in her pretty French accentuated broken
                     English:</p>
                  <p>"Dis is good, bon, for you. You mus' drink eet, et il faut mangér le pain. It
                     is too long time to wait for Baptiste. He haf his souper often tres tard."</p>
                  <p>Lucian obeyed the kind command, thanking her warmly for her consideration.
                     Marie leaned against a pillar of the rough porch, holding the tray in her
                     drooping hand, waiting patiently until Lucian had eaten his supper. She looked
                     out on the sea, if perchance she might see the white sail of Baptiste's boat
                     coming into the bay "Ah, le viola!" she murmured, as the sail came into full
                     view, running easily and gracefully before the wind under the hands of its
                     skillful helmsman.</p>
                  <p>"Is that your husband's boat?" asked Lucian, as he replaced the now exhausted
                     cup and plate on the extended tray.</p>
                  <p>"Oui. Ah mon Dieu! I mean yes, dat is le batteau de mon man. I hope he have
                     good success; he stay late dis night."</p>
                  <p>"Are you never frightened, uneasy about him, Marie, when he is off on the sea
                     all day?"</p>
                  <p>Marie had replaced the tray inside of her apartment, and returned again to her
                     place of observation, leaning against the square post. Slie put her hands
                     together with a pretty, earnest gesture of petition.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, ma foi, yes. Wen the wind blow hard, and the waves dash way up mos' so far
                     as here, then I pray, often, often, with fear for my Baptiste; but he not
                     scared,—he like <emph>leetle</emph> storm, he so strong and brave. Good
                     fisherman is my husband."</p>
                  <p>Marie spoke with pride and wifely exultation of Baptiste's great strength and
                     skill. It was very evident that little woman admired her huge son of Neptune,
                     with his long grizzled beard, extravagantly.</p>
                  <p>"Does he make much by his trade?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he make very good livin'; an' I sew an' wash leetle, when I am well, for
                     ladies in next house, over there."</p>
                  <p>Marie waved her hand towards a large, handsome house nearly a mile off, almost
                     hidden by great trees and shrubs clustered around it. Lucian could just catch a
                     glimpse of white columns and part of the roof with its tall chimney-stacks.</p>
                  <p>"Who lives there, Marie?"</p>
                  <p>"A blin' monsieur, wid his daughter, an' petite fille, wat you call
                     gran'-daughter. He only leef dere in de summer. Many rich planters come spen'
                     summer here,—leef on de habitations in de winter."</p>
                  <p>"What is his name, Marie?"</p>
                  <p>"De blin' monsieur? His name is Laurie. He very good to Baptiste; he gif him
                     dat beautiful new boat and de long seine he fish wid, for cadeau, wen we marry.
                     Mademoiselle Annie, she charmante,—si douce, si bonne; and dat leetle
                     Marguerite, de petite fille, she 'ave onze ans! She is full mischeef; mais
                     aimable, aimable comme les petits anges. She abe cheveux, wat you call 'air,
                     down to do knees, brun, do-rée, it shine like de soleil; et des grands jeux
                     gris, grands clair comme le ciel. Elle est jolie, si jolie, mais full, ful
                     mischeef."</p>
                  <p>Marie laughed, apparently at some reminiscence of amusing freak on the part of
                     the "leetle" Margaret, who was evidently a great favorite.</p>
                  <p>"She come often to see me; she lof me, dat jolie Marguerite."</p>
                  <p>Baptiste's boat had run into the pier. He got out, and, with the aid of his
                     companion in fishing, a neighbor's son, made his boat fast to the pier, and
                     hung his seine on the fence to dry.</p>
                  <p>Marie threw her checked apron over her head, and went down to meet her stalwart
                     husband.</p>
                  <p>Baptiste greeted her with a kiss, first on one cheek, then the other, creole
                     fashion, then picked up his heavy baskets of fish, and brought them up to a
                     cool out-house, where he deposited them. Then, after copious ablutions, and
                     changing his wet, muddy clothes for the dry, comfortable, though coarse,
                     garments his wife had hanging ready for him on a chair before the kitchen fire,
                     Marie gave him his supper of coffee, bread, and a rasher of bacon, with a piece
                     of cold fruit-pie; and he lighted his pipe, and coming out on the gallery,
                     joined his lodger sitting in his large deal easy chair in perfect content.</p>
                  <p>Marie, after putting things to rights in her own and Lucian's apartments,
                     joined them, sitting down on the step next her husband, leaning gracefully with
                     her clasped hands against his knee, as she listened to the conversation between
                     Lucian and the fisherman. Baptiste told him about his fishing, and the terrible
                     storms they would sometimes have, when the water of the Gulf would be driven up
                     far above the shore; of the state of the markets; of the yield of his vineyard.
                     He spoke, also, of their neighbor, Mr. Laurie,—a good man, strict and just, a
                     great scholar, but blind so many years; of his daughter's devotion to him, and
                     of the beauty of the merry, generous Margaret. He showed Lucian the pipe he was
                     smoking, that Margaret had given him,—a neat meerschaum with his name on the
                     case he kept it in. "Mademoiselle Annie," he said, "brought Marie such pretty
                     dresses—of clear 'brillante' Marie called it—and a whole piece of fine white
                     muslin for—"Marie clapped her hand over the mouth of her loquacious husband.
                     "There, that will do, Baptiste; Monsieur is doubtless fatigué, he is si faible
                     encore; and you are fatigué also. It is temps for us all to go to sleep. Bon
                     répos, Monsieur, vôtre chambre est tout arrangeé je crois. Venez donc,
                     Baptiste!"</p>
                  <p>Marie dragged off her laughing husband,<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6308-00000029"
                     /> with one of her fingers locked in his great hand. Lucian felt the need of
                     rest, so he followed Marie's advice, went to bed, taking time to think of and
                     wonder over the varied incidents of his career. He thought of his sister,
                     Cousin Vail, his stern father, Jacob Doddson, who had returned to New Orleans
                     to buy his drays, but promised to spend his Sundays with Lucian at the Pass
                     Lucian remembered Doctor Rock, then his thoughts wandered off with a dim
                     curiosity towards the Lauries, the blind father, the devoted daughter, the
                     merry Margaret; then he forgot everything in dreamless sleep.</p>

                  <p>WHEN Lucian woke next morning, he found the day well advanced. The sun streamed
                     cheerfully in through the grapevines; the mocking-birds were singing their
                     loudest and gayest trills, the waves moaned a monotonous, perpetual base to
                     their shrill treble.</p>
                  <p>Marie gave him his breakfast, which she had kept hot for him. Baptiste had gone
                     off before day with his fish to the city. "Lucian" felt so much better than
                     "Montague" did when he quitted the hospital, he thought he could manage to walk
                     as far as the old live oak, and rest among its roots, whilst Marie arranged his
                     room—it looked so inviting out there. Borrowing a strong knotted stick,
                     belonging to Baptiste, from Marie, Lucian started slowly on his short
                     expedition, with steps which, though certainly still rather unsteady, were
                     greatly strengthened since he tried to walk at the hospital in the stifling,
                     hot city. His rapid recovery of strength surprised him, but still he was very
                     glad to sink down among the gnarled roots of the old oak. Marie, seeing the
                     point he was aiming to reach, followed him quickly, carrying a plain, soft
                     cushion for him to rest on; she fixed it to suit <emph>her</emph> notion of
                     comfort, and Lucian, half-reclining, supported by the projecting roots, nearly
                     buried from external view by the protruding, serpent-like radié, felt almost as
                     if cradled. Shut out from all the cares and strifes of the world, with its
                     human griefs and joys—above him the sky, before him the wide, wide ocean, whose
                     outermost wave washed the shore of Cornwall. He lay there idly, hour after
                     hour, immersed in thoughts, "black, white and grey," when his reverie was
                     broken in upon by the sound of voices near by. They were not disagreeably
                     sounding voices either. Stretching his neck upward, so he could see through the
                     roots among which he was nestled, he perceived, down close by the margin of the
                     water, two figures. One was a negro girl, about twelve years of age, carrying a
                     basket partly filled with sea-weed and shells. The other he recognized
                     immediately must be the original of Marie's sketch, "the beautiful,
                     mischievous" Margaret. There she stood—a girl rather tall and slight—eleven
                     years old her dress still short above Ler slender ankles, which were plainly
                     displayed in all their tenuity by the boots laced up high on the leg,
                     exhibiting still a space of smoothly gartered stocking between the top of the
                     boot and the embroidered ruffle of the pantalette; the edges of white were
                     barely visible below the hem of her short skirt of blue plaid. Her hands
                     sported leather gauntlets, as strong and thick as those Laertes "wore on
                        <emph>his</emph> hands, on account of the brambles" in his garden. But
                     Lucian, though his eye took hasty note of all this, lingered not long away from
                     the pretty, pretty face which surmounted all. There were the "bluegrey eyes
                     clear as the heaven," as Marie said—the lovely, laughing mouth, showing teeth
                     white as seed-corn in the milk, the pink, delicate cheek, the pretty chin, the
                     straight, chisselled nose, with a proud, dilating nostril, like an Arabian
                     horse's; a fair, pure, broad, low brow, like Clytie's, and the wealth, the
                     exuberant flood of golden brown curls, falling over neck and shoulders far down
                     below the slender, unformed waist—a glittering net to catch and hold sunbeams,
                     it seemed just now—shining, waving, sparkling, like bronze floss-silk—giving a
                     striking, almost supernatural appearance to this fair creature. Lucian was not
                     surprised that Marie said "she looked like the angels."</p>
                  <p>She wore on her head a large flat hat, with very broad brim, and a long, blue
                     veil sewed firmly on the crown; she was busy just now, with both hands, engaged
                     in twisting up this yard and a half of veil, into a sort of rope, which she
                     wound round and round the crown of her hat, making a grotesque but becoming
                     huge turban of the whole head-gear.</p>
                  <p>"Now then, Jenny, I have twisted my veil up out of danger of the water. I
                     intend to have that piece of sea-weed out yonder; it is a very pretty piece,
                     and just what I have been trying to get for a week to finish my basket—it is a
                     red piece; don't you see?"</p>
                  <p>"La, den, Miss Marget, how you gwine get dat'ar? It is too fur out in de water,
                     and de tide gwine to run in, right straight 'way."</p>
                  <p>Margaret stood looking meditatively at the coveted piece of weed. It was too
                     far out for wading with shoes; it lay just out of reach of sticks, no matter
                     how she stretched out her arm. Making Jenny hold her fast, as she stood on the
                     very verge of the water, leaning as far as she dared out of the perpendicular,
                     she could not attain tain to the treasure—she looked inquiringly at Jenny's
                     feet, incased in shoes, but like Haidee's, without stockings.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny," said she, coaxingly, "couldn't you take off your shoes, and wade in
                     atter it?"</p>
                  <p>Jenny turned up the whites of her eyes at this proposition.</p>
                  <p>"Deed, Missie, I'se afraid o' crabs, and sting-rays; dey is mighty bad about
                     here. It wasn't no longer nor yesterday Coullisse's boy were stuck bad wid a
                     sting ray, awadin' near dis'ere place."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw, Jenny, the crabs won't hurt you; they'd run away from you. Well, if you
                     won't, I <emph>will!</emph>" and sitting down upon a log of driftwood, the
                     resolute Margaret began to unlace her boots.</p>
                  <p>"La, Missie, what you gwine do?"</p>
                  <p>"I am going to have that piece of seaweed; the water won't come to my knees
                     yet."</p>
                  <p>Jenny stood looking with her eyes stretched wide, and her tongue thrust between
                     her teeth, in unfeigned astonishment at the rapid movements of Margaret's hands
                     as she deliberately unlaced her boots, taking them, throwing them to one side;
                     then she drew off her stockings and piled them with their blue elastics in a
                     heap on top of the boots, to keep them off the sand. Then Margaret, with a
                     joyous laugh, set her small white naked feet down on the warm smooth sand;
                     rolling her pantalettes up above her knees, with a waive of her hand' to Jenny,
                     and a cry of "hurrah," Margaret stepped forward delightedly into the advancing
                     wave, which seemed running to kiss her pearly little feet. She marched on
                     valorously into the deepening water till she secured her prize. She tossed it
                     to Jenny. Now seeming to find it agreeable in the warm bright water, Margaret
                     paddled about along the shore, picking up shells and bits of weed, until Jenny,
                     finding her "Missie" unimpeded by crabs, nettles, or sting-rays, took off her
                     shoes and walked in after her. These two seemed to enjoy the tramp amazingly,
                     and Lucian smiled often at Margaret's gay speeches and pretty willful ways in
                     her innocent play. This went on for a half hour, when suddenly Lucian heard a
                     scream from Jenny, reëchoed by a shriek from Margaret. Lucian forgot he was ill
                     or weak. He sprang from his lair and hastened to the sea—edge. Jenny was
                     standing, holding on fast to Margaret with both hands, kicking furiously
                     backward with one foot, crying vehemently:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lord! Lord ha' massy! Oh, I is kilt—oh, Miss Marget!"</p>
                  <p>Margaret screamed helplessly:</p>
                  <p>"Marie! Marie!—Oh! do come here, Marie!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian dashed into the water, boots and all, to the relief of the distressed
                     pair. He felt strong in the momentary excitement.</p>
                  <p>"What is it? What is the matter?" inquired he anxiously before he reached
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Jenny was howling, and great tears were raining down Margaret's pink
                     cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it's a crab—dem got hold of my toe—oh!" screamed Jenny, with another
                     desperate kick, but the indomitable crustacean kept a firm grip.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, please, can't you get it off of Jenny?" exclaimed Margaret, glancing
                     anxiously up into Lucian's face.</p>
                  <p>"I expect so. Hold still, Jenny." Lucian gave the crab—it was a good sized
                     one—a kick with his boot; the creature turned to seize the new enemy, letting
                     go its grasp of Jenny's big toe. Lucian gave it another kick, which threw it
                     high in the air and further out in the water, whence it swam victoriously in
                     its usual retrograde fashion far out to sea. Jenny, when freed from her
                     tormentor, made one dash through the water to the shore, and sat down to
                     examine her wounded member—the opposite point to the mortal unbathed spot in
                     the foot of Achilles. Margaret came out more slowly, accepting Lucian's
                     proffered hand in picking her path through the fast increasing waves. She had
                     taken one look at her new acquaintance; he was not very frightful; she rather
                     liked the pale, handsome, boyish face.</p>
                  <p>"How did you happen to hear us?" she asked—"were you walking along the
                     road?"</p>
                  <p>"No. I was up there by the tree. I am living now at Baptiste's cottage. I heard
                     Marie speak of you—Miss Guion, is it not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the girl, frankly; "I like Marie. Are you the lodger she told me
                     yesterday she was going to have?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I am the lodger," said Lucian, smiling at her naiveté."</p>
                  <p>"Oh," exclaimed Margaret, "and you have been so sick, Marie said; and here you
                     are in this water with your shoes on! I am so sorry; I hope it won't make you
                     ill again. Oh, <emph>do</emph> hurry out, and change your wet shoes and
                     clothes."</p>
                  <p>Margaret was hastening onward, when she suddenly stopped, drew her hand from
                     Lucian's, her face suffused with a deep color.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, please."</p>
                  <p>"What is it, Miss Margaret?"</p>
                  <p>"Please go on before me, and go quite away to Marie's house—I—I—"</p>
                  <p>She did not complete the sentence, but glanced disconsolately at the white heap
                     of stockings and shoes on the sands. She remembered her bare feet and legs.</p>
                  <p>Lucian smiled in spite of himself, Margaret looked so forlornly disconsolate
                     and ashamed.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind; I have a sister at home," he said, consolingly; though he knew
                        Lucia<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6308-00000030"/> never was guilty of such a
                     hoydenish freak as this in her life.</p>
                  <p>Lucian stalked on out of the water, picked up his stick, and got towards
                     Baptiste's cottage as fast as he could. His steps were rather trembling now. As
                     he entered the gate, and turned to close the latch, he saw that Margaret had
                     come out of the water and was sitting on the log, wiping her feet with her
                     pocket handkerchief, preparatory to donning her shoes and stockings. Lucian
                     reached his room, changed his clothes, then sunk on the bed, he felt so faint;
                     he called aloud, "Marie."</p>
                  <p>Marie came instantly.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, mon Dieu! wat 'ave you been doin'? You are all pale like phantome; you
                     must 'ave some eau de vie; you 'ave over-exert yourself."</p>
                  <p>She made him drink some strong brandy and lie down on his bed.</p>
                  <p>Margaret was very grave until she got her lower limbs properly encased, a good
                     deal troubled, and half ashamed of being surprised by a stranger in such an
                     unlady-like predicament. Her stately governess, Miss Smith, would be shocked to
                     hear of it. Margaret's contrition was deep; but looking up, after the little
                     feet were properly in their coverings, at the afflicted Jenny, who still sat
                     bemoaning her bruised toe, the absurdity of the whole position struck Margaret
                     so forcibly that her repentant sobriety vanished. She put her hands up before
                     her face, and the shore rang merrily to her shrieks of laughter—laughter so
                     hearty, child-like and clear in its silvery ringing, that even Jenny was seized
                     sympathetically, ceased her mourning, and laughed in chorus.</p>
                  <p>After they had both laughed themselves weak, Jenny put on her shoes, and
                     picking up the basket, limped after Margaret, who started towards home in a
                     run. As they drew near Baptiste's gate, Margaret halted.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny, I think we ought to ask how the young gentleman is. It might make him
                     sick again going in the water."</p>
                  <p>Jenny agreed that politeness required this attention from them.</p>
                  <p>So Margaret lifted the latch, opened the gate and went in.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Marie, how is the gentleman? I hope it won't hurt him!"</p>
                  <p>"What won't hurt?" asked smiling Marie. "What 'ave you been doing, you wile
                     chile? I'ave give him some eau de vie, he look so very pale."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Marie, I will be sorry if he gets sick. Twas Jenny—" Then Margaret gave a
                     hasty, graphic sketch of the position from which Lucian had rescued them. Marie
                     laughed very heartily over it.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, chile, you are too wile. You must not go vizont vos souliors any more—what
                     would Miss Annie say?"</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Annie will scold, but she will laugh too," said the spoiled Margaret;
                     "but don't let the gentleman get sick, Marie. Can I bring you any thing? Shall
                     I tell the housekeeper to send you some jellies or some patés for him? Can't I
                     bring you any thing? Poor fellow! He looks so pale—and he says he has a sister
                     at home. I would like to bring him something, Marie."</p>
                  <p>"Well, chile, you bring him some books—he indispose, and can read under le
                     grand chene—that you can bring."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I will! Come, Jenny, let's go." The impulsive Margaret was about to run
                     off then and there for as many books as she and Jenny could transport, but
                     Marie stopped her.</p>
                  <p>"Not to-day, my dear chile; not to-day. He must rest and sleep. Apportez les
                     livres, demain—to-morrow, dat is besser."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, to-morrow I will bring some. Come, Jenny, let's go now."</p>
                  <p>Through the thin partition of his room, Lucian overheard this colloquy. He
                     laughed almost as merrily as Margaret over Jenny's despair. He was glad to have
                     the promise of some books to read, and still more pleased to have the prospect
                     of continuing the acquaintance so happily begun with brown-tressed
                     Margaret.</p>

                  <head type="sub">AN IDYLL BY THE SEA.</head>
                  <p>EARLY after breakfast next morning Lucian was in his seat among the roots of
                     the broad, spreading oak. He had not been long ensconced in his comfortable
                     hiding-place before he heard steps and voices drawing near. Directly he saw
                     approaching his two Naiads of the previous day. Margaret had her arms filled
                     with books, which she carried with difficulty; Jenny walked easily, swinging
                     her arms by her side, while a large basket, gracefully poised on top of her
                     woolly head, gave evidence, through the interstices of the wicker-work, that it
                     was filled with the same food for the intellect. Margaret hastened forward as
                     soon as she distinguished her new acquaintance among the roots, with eager
                     impetuosity. She was true, and frank, and naive, as a very little child. She
                     looked even younger than she was from the profusion of hair falling around her.
                     She laid her books down on a root at Lucian's feet, with a sigh of
                     satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"There! I thought you would be here. I told Jenny so. How are you this morning?
                     I am glad you didn't get sick. I told grandpa and Aunt Annie about you. They
                     say you must come to see them. I'll show you the way to grandpa's any time.
                     Aunt Annie did not scold about yesterday, but she says I must not go into the
                     water by myself, or alone with Jenny,—I might get caught in the under-tow.</p>
                  <p>Jenny deposited her basket on the ground before Lucian, saying, with a broad,
                     good-humored grin that showed teeth, gums, and all,—</p>
                  <p>"Dar's some more books, Miss Marget brung you, sir," making at the same time a
                     dot of a courtesy, according to the etiquette of "manners."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, Jenny." Lucian held out his hand to Margaret with a smile of
                     welcome.</p>
                  <p>"You are so very good, Miss Margaret, I could almost desire to be a little sick
                     to secure such sympathy. I am so grateful for the books! They are just what I
                     needed."</p>
                  <p>Margaret seated herself unceremoniously on a root next to Lucian. Jenny dropped
                     down, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la</foreign> Turque, on the thin grass at
                     Margaret's feet, and very gravely putting her hand in her pocket drew out a
                     coarse, unfinished stocking, and begun knitting on it, looking around every now
                     and then at Lucian and Margaret, or at the sky or ocean, with a vague gaping
                     wonder and interest. Margaret untied her hat, the long curls floated around her
                     in waving light; she twisted the veil around the hat in her favorite style,
                     then taking the hat by the broad brim, she fanned herself with it. Her cheeks
                     were deep colored from her fast walk and the heavy books she had carried; her
                     eyes were so clear and so true. Lucian thought of all the beautiful creatures
                     he had ever read of whilst looking at her as she sat there fanning herself. She
                     said,—</p>
                  <p>"You haven't looked at your books. I chose them myself. I thought of asking
                     Aunt Annie, but then she likes such learned books—Greek and Latin and Hebrew
                     and Sanscrit. I don't like them so much; but perhaps you do," turning the
                     blue-grey eyes on him questioningly. "If you do, I can get you some. Grandpa
                     has plenty; but I brought you this morning some I like. Here's Scott's novels,
                     and Paul and Virginia, and Picciola, and Scott's poems, and Shakespeare, and
                     Vicar of Wakefield, and Jerusalem Delivered, and Spenser's Faierie Queen, in
                     English. I can get you books in any language. Grandpa and Aunt Annie read them
                     all, but I only know French and a little Italian yet. Now you must tell me what
                     you would like."</p>
                  <p>Lucian assured her she could not have selected, to suit his tastes, better
                     books than already he saw before him. Taking up Paul and Virginia, he opened
                     it. It was a fine copy, with Margaret's name on the fly-leaf.</p>
                  <p>"Don't you like that? I do!" exclaimed Margaret.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, indeed I do. Do you know I thought before I came to Louisiana I would
                     find palm-trees and cocoa-nuts and bananas growing wild here? Of course I have
                     not, though I <emph>have</emph> found something that I did not expect to."</p>
                  <p>"What is that?" asked Margaret.</p>
                  <p>Lucian was about to say "<emph>Virginia";</emph> but, looking at the clear,
                     frank, child-like eyes fixed on him, he couldn't; so he said "kindness."</p>
                  <p>"Are not the people kind in your country? Which is your country?"</p>
                  <p>"England was my country," replied Lucian, sadly. Margaret noticed the
                     melancholy expression that flitted over his face with child-like grace; she
                     leaned over, and, laying her gloved hand on his as he held the book, she
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"Never mind. <emph>This</emph> is a good country. Don't be sad. I won't ask you
                     any more questions: it makes you remember trouble, I am afraid. Don't you like
                     to read? Let us read some. Jenny likes to hear, too."</p>
                  <p>Jenny scratched her woolly head with her knitting-needle, and nodded it quickly
                     in assent to Margaret's proposition.</p>
                  <p>Margaret ceased fanning herself, put her hat on her head, tied the long blue
                     ribands, and settled herself so she could look over Lucian's shoulder and
                     follow the reading.</p>
                  <p>"But perhaps," remarked she, drawing herself back, "perhaps you don't like
                     anybody to look over you. Aunt Annie says it is not polite, but she <emph>lets
                        me do it</emph> when she reads to me."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed but I do like it. I would rather you did," declared Lucian, turning so
                     she could get a fair view of the page over his shoulder, which was easily
                     arranged, as Margaret sat higher than he on a root above him, her back
                     supported by the trunk of the huge tree, while he was nestled below.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, don't let's read 'Paul' now," said Margaret, "let's read some poetry. It
                     sounds so pretty, with the waves dashing. Read Scott, or Spenser, the Lady of
                     the Lake, or the Red-cross knight. I like all that fairy story about Una and
                     the Lion and the Wizard; but I like the Lay of the Last Minstrel most as
                     well."</p>
                  <p>"We'll read that, then," said Lucian; but let's skip the Prologue."</p>
                  <p>Lucian began with the story. He read on, as long as his weakness permitted, for
                     at least an hour. Margaret, listening intently, detected the failing of his
                     voice. She put her hand over the book.</p>
                  <p>"There, that will do; that is beautiful. I like your reading, you have such a
                     nice voice; but you are tired now. Jenny, where's the other basket?"</p>
                  <p>Jenny laid her knitting on the sand, pulled the large basket that had contained
                     the books towards her, and lifted out of a corner a small covered basket
                     closely tied with a blue riband. She handed it to her<pb n="60-61"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000031"/> "Missie" Margaret, untied the riband, removed a
                     napkin, and exhibited some bread nicely buttered, some cold chicken, sponge
                     cakes, a mould of jelly still in the tin, and some oranges.</p>
                  <p>"Now, here's some luncheon. Betsy the housekeeper put it up. She wouldn't give
                     me any fruit-cake. She said it was indigestible,—it wasn't good for a sick
                     person. I told her I was going to give <emph>you</emph> part of it."</p>
                  <p>Lucian smiled, he felt as if in a dream—but it was a very pleasant dream—so he
                     shut up the book, and very contentedly ate his portion of the viands "Betsy"
                     permitted him to have, as a convalescent. Margaret prattled away while they
                     discussed the lunch. She told him she had holidays now for two months, her
                     governess having gone to visit some relatives; that Aunt Annie was very much
                     confined with grandpa—"who is so dependent you know, being blind." So she,
                     Margaret, went about according to her own wayward will, always being
                     accompanied by Jenny. "Everybody knows me," she said, "and everybody is kind to
                     me and Jenny." Jenny made her usual endorsement, a jerk of the head, her mouth
                     being, just at that moment, too full of pie for speech. Margaret told him she
                     had made grandpa laugh heartily at her account of their little adventure
                     yesterday, and Aunt Annie had made her promise never to take off her shoes and
                     stockings any more in such a place, and that grandpa said when Lucian was
                     strong enough he would like for him to come to pay him a visit. "You'll go,
                     won't you?" asked Margaret. "You know grandpa is blind, and I want to show you
                     my basket of seaweed. Aunt Annie fixed it for me, and told me all the weeds,
                     and she read me 'The Young Sea Maiden.' Did you ever read it? Do you think she
                     was right to go into foam, for the sake of the prince? I do, but Jenny
                     don't!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian did not remember the story.</p>
                  <p>"Well, I'll bring it to-morrow for you to read," said Margaret, "and now I must
                     go; but I will come again to-morrow. Don't read any more in Scott, while I am
                     gone—read the other books."</p>
                  <p>Lucian vowed not even to look at Scott during her absence.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny," said Margaret, considerately, "let us carry the books to Marie's
                     cottage—there are so many, and they will be too heavy for Mr.—oh!" opening her
                     eyes widely, with a gleaming smile, "I don't know your name! What is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Lucian Courtenay," was the laughing reply, though a conscious blush suffused
                     the boy's cheek, at having to deceive this pure child even in this matter.</p>
                  <p>"That's a very pretty name! My mother's name was <emph>Lucia,</emph> so I like
                     it, though I never knew her—Aunt Annie brought me up! Have you got your books,
                     Jenny?" Jenny nodded her head. "Give me mine, Mr. Courtenay—I am going to leave
                     you Shakespeare to read by yourself this morning, whilst these others must all
                     go to Marie's. Don't you like Ariel's song? I do—I can sing it. Good by."</p>
                  <p>Nodding gaily, her arms full of books, Margaret started off, followed by Jenny,
                     with her basket on her head. Margaret sung in clear, lovely child's voice, as
                     she walked— <q>
                        <l>"Where the bee sucks there lurk I;"</l>
                     </q> doing the trills at the end of the song as flexibly and joyously as a
                     canary bird.</p>
                  <p>Lucian was left with Shakespeare in his hands, pleasant thoughts too for
                     companions, by the sea-side, under the deep shade of the old oak.</p>
                  <p>The Idyll continued for these children, during the whole summer. The three were
                     together every morning, when the weather permitted. They read all the books
                     Margaret fancied, and the luncheon was always forthcoming. Sometimes after that
                     Margaret would sing—she had a wonderful voice for a child; she knew numbers of
                     old ballads, and simple songs; she could imitate anything she heard like a very
                     mocking bird. The voice was light and childish, but very true in intonation,
                     and pleasing to listen to.</p>
                  <p>Jenny was always present; she seemed to enjoy the readings; but as usually
                     after a brief time of apparent intense quiet and absorption, the everlasting
                     stocking she was knitting drooped in her hands, and she would gradually subside
                     into an undistinguishable heap of head, breast, hands and stocking. It is to be
                     feared Jenny did not profit intellectually as she might have done, considering
                     her opportunities. She had always to be roused vigorously in order to the
                     production of the never failing basket, which, by Betsy's providence, was as
                     well provided as the widow's famous cruise, Margaret's favorite fruit-cake
                     being now admitted as unobjectionable. Lucian had been escorted by Margaret to
                     make a visit to her grandfather, and Aunt Annie; he was also duly presented to
                     Betsy, whose heart he won by his graceful expressions of gratitude, for her
                     consideration of him in the matter of the lunch-basket.</p>
                  <p>"Now mind you, Sallie, that's a raal gentleman an' no mistake," Betsy remarked
                     to her friend the cook, after the interview.</p>
                  <p>Lucian was delighted with the venerable Mr. Laurie—a man of noble presence,
                     with long snow-white hair, and beard down on his breast, his eyes dark and
                     still handsome in color and form, but the sight utterly destroyed with
                     amaurosis, which gave a dull, glassy look to the iris. Mr. Laurie, like most
                     blind persons, was much affected in impressions of people, by the tones of
                     their voice. Lucian's voice, as Margaret told him so innocently, "was very
                     nice;" it was very round, full, rich and soft—it struck the blind man's ear
                     most agreeably—he was pleased, too, with the youth's modest answers in
                     conversation, his intelligence, his evident refinement in mind, expression and
                     manner. Annie Laurie took a womanly "fancy" to the pale, slender, aristocratic
                     young friend of her pet "Margaret." So Lucian found himself a welcome and
                     frequent guest at Mr. Laurie's house. But that never interfered with the
                     "readings," which had now grown to be a matter of habit and daily custom that
                     no longer awoke a remark from any one. Lucian was acknowledged in Margaret's
                     little world as her protegé; anything she took under her powerful wing was duly
                     respected from the white kitten upwards through the ascending chain of animal
                     life, ending in Lucian Courtenay.</p>
                  <p>This family, and Baptiste's, and Jacob Doddson, who came over often on Sundays
                     and reported himself getting on finely with the world, constituted Lucian's
                     whole circle of society. Lucian's health was reinstated; he knew he ought to
                     try to get to work now; but he was so happy where he was—he had become so
                     attached to his new friends, that he shrunk from parting with them, especially
                     with Margaret. So he lingered, week after week. September found him a cherished
                     inmate of Baptiste's cottage—still reading and wandering about the shore with
                     Margaret—spending every evening with Mr. Laurie's family, assembled with them
                     around the patient, kindly blind man, or sitting with them in the shaded
                     piazza, looking out on the Gulf—drinking coffee and partaking of the light
                     repast of cakes and fruit, offered by the fair hands of Annie Laurie. The
                     shining-haired Margaret, on such occasions, leaning against her indulgent
                     grandfather, or seated by Lucian, prattling away to the delight of the little
                     circle of her devoted admirers. One evening, when Lucian went as usual to Mr.
                     Laurie's, he found their family group enlarged by the addition of Mr. Ashton,
                     who was evidently an intimate and valued guest. Lucian surveyed his new
                     acquaintance with interest. There was something peculiarly fascinating about
                     Harold Ashton, and yet one could hardly define it, unless it was the sense of
                     power of will, self-reliance, which, although so prominent a quality in his
                     character as to make itself felt, yet was not ungracefully nor dogmatically
                     exhibited. He was not handsome according to the strict rules of "To Kalon," but
                     there was a brilliant gracefulness about his mobile features, and his every
                     motion—a clear, distinct utterance of thought and word, an aptness, a
                     discrimination, tact, precision, general facility, that caught and held
                     attention rivited upon him. Lucian found himself stopping to listen whenever
                     the tones of that exquisitely modulated voice fell upon his ear, in its
                     polished, educated utterance, and what Harold Ashton said was generally worth
                     listening to. A mind so cultivated, so various in its acquirements, so
                     eloquent, so gay, so pathetic, so changeful, Lucian had never come in contact
                     with before. Margaret forsook "grandfather and Lucian," and seated herself near
                     to Mr. Ashton, who seemed to join with all the others in spoiling her. Mr.
                     Laurie was quite gay under the impetus of this strong, fresh, original nature,
                     and Annie—Lucian needed only one look at her softly gleaming eyes, her sweet
                     absorption of every look, every word of Harold Ashton's, to see what he was to
                     her. The "alabaster vase" was illuminated this evening in a resplendent manner.
                     Lucian had never before thought Annie Laurie beautiful; he gazed on her with
                     wonder. Was this radiant woman, who seemed transfigured by the soft bright
                     fire, shining so joyously out her dark blue eyes, whose dilated pupils now made
                     them seem almost black, scattering light, nearly visible in every glance—could
                     this be Annie Laurie? He had thought her always delicate, lady-like, but not
                     even pretty. Now the cheeks, usually so pale, were flushed with a carnation
                     varying and tender as a pink cloud of sunset—her voice, always low and sweet,
                     now had a thrush sound, vibrating as if from heart cords.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" thought Lucian, looking at Annie almost with superstitious fear, as he
                     watched her rendering gayly to Harold the hospitable attentions due a guest at
                     her own table. "Good heavens! If anything should happen to that man, what would
                     become of that woman? How she does love him!" Lucian felt himself in an
                     intoxicated atmosphere in the society of these lovers. Lucian remembered,
                     strangely, a sentence he had read underscored, in Annie's favorite "Imitation
                     of Christ:"</p>
                  <p>"He that cleaveth to a creature shall fall when it falls."</p>
                  <p>The others seemed unconscious of this rapt devotion on Annie's part to Harold.
                     Mr. Laurie could not see, and Margaret was too young to notice any thing of
                     this kind.</p>
                  <p>After tea, Annie asked Lucian and Margaret to remain with her father while she
                     took her customary evening walk. It was the usual order of the day for her to
                     quit them and go out at this hour, after devoting herself to her father all
                     day. The hour after tea was her's—to be alone. She usually walked out on the
                     beach. Harold took his hat and followed her. Margaret went back to her
                     grand-father, leaning on his knee and smoothing his long, grey locks with her
                     caressing hand. The old man put his arm fondly around her, and drew her close
                     to him. Lucian sat on the steps near by.</p>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6308-00000032"/>
                  <p>"Grandpa, Mr. Ashton does not look well," remarked Margaret; "he looks tired
                     and he works too hard, I expect."</p>
                  <p>"Yes; I fear he does, Fairy," replied Mr. Laurie. "He is so ambitions and so
                     proud he will not let any body help him or aid him in his struggle up the
                     ladder of rame."</p>
                  <p>Lucia asked "what he did?"</p>
                  <p>"He is a lawyer now," replied Mr. Laurie; "is a self-educated and a self-made
                     man. He taught in my family several years; educated Annie, principally—or
                     rather aided me in educating her. So far as I could, I have devoted myself to
                     the development of her most extraordinary mental gifts!"</p>
                  <p>"The old story of Abelard and Héloise," thought Lucian, "remodelled to suit the
                     nineteenth century;" but he only said:</p>
                  <p>"Is Miss Laurie so accomplished?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie smiled: "She is so true and so modest a woman, so perfectly
                     feminine, that you have never discovered yet what she is. I know of no woman
                     comparable to Annie Laurie in acquirements, except in the accounts we receive
                     from history of Ann Maria Schurman, who was called by her compatriots 'the
                     Wonder of Creation.' Annie has devoted herself to study, because she loved
                     it—but principally because she has thus been able to make herself my companion,
                     and so supply the deficiency of my lost sight. She is a good, good daughter,
                     and a good scholar. I am very dependent on her. Such a scholar my little
                     Margaret here, never will be." Mr. Laurie drew the bright head down on his
                     bosom fondly.</p>
                  <p>"No, grandpa. I never can be," exclaimed Margaret; "but you will love me just
                     as much—won't you? And you too, Lucian?"</p>
                  <p>Lucian assured her "ignorance could not make any abatement in his affection: he
                     really did not believe he could love her any more if she was learned as Corinna
                     herself—"Besides, <emph>I</emph> don't know much Margaret."</p>
                  <p>"In comparison with grandpa, and Mr. Ashton, and Aunt Annie, I don't think you
                     do, Lucian," said the honest Margaret; "but learning is <emph>not</emph> every
                     thing."</p>
                  <p>Lucian was melancholy this evening. Margaret observed it. The child was
                     singularly sympathetic and observant, in spite of her gayety and wildness. She
                     forsook her grandfather, came round to Lucian and sat down beside him on the
                     steps.</p>
                  <p>"What ails you, Lucian? Have you got a head-ache? Shall I put some vinaigre
                     hygienique on your head?"</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Lucian, taking the hand of his child-friend; "no, I haven't a
                     headache; I have a heart-ache, Margaret. I must go away soon—leave you, and
                     this pleasant life we've been leading."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Why must you go away? Grandpa, Lucian says he must go away. Oh! why must
                     he go?" exclaimed the child in tremulous tones, her lips quivering and her grey
                     eyes filling up with tears.</p>
                  <p>"Because, dear little Margaret, I have got my living to make; I must go out in
                     the world and make some money, as Mr. Ashton is trying to do. I have very
                     little money. I am not rich."</p>
                  <p>Margaret put both hands up to her face and burst out into a passionate fit of
                     weeping and loud lamentation:</p>
                  <p>"Oh! please don't go! Grandpa, I don't want Lucian to go. You have got plenty
                     of money; please make Lucian stay—he is not a grown-up man like Mr. Ashton, and
                     he's not so strong either. He will get sick again if he goes away—grandpa,
                     don't let him go!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian began to "<emph>cry</emph>" a little himself, though he tried to hide
                     it. He began to say: "My dear little girl, I must;" but his voice quivered and
                     he fairly broke down, and nothing was audible save Margaret's sobs in her
                     childish abandon of grief.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie moved uneasily; he could not bear to hear his pet weep so, and he
                     really liked Lucian very much. He knew nothing about him; but all he had known
                     was very favorable to the young man. He seemed well-principled, refined,
                     well-bred. Mr. Laurie was uncomfortable—made a restless motion in his chair:
                     "Margaret, come here."</p>
                  <p>Margaret obeyed the summons, sobbing as she came. The old man opened his arms
                     and drew the weeping child on his heart; but Margaret refused to be comforted.
                     Jenny, who was not far off, seeing Margaret weep, and Lucian with his hand over
                     his eyes, in a very unmanly mode, gave utterance to a howl of grief, and buried
                     her face in her apron, dissolved in sympathetic tears.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie, who was really moved by his darling's unfeigned sorrow, could not
                     repress a laugh of amusement when Jenny's dolorous howl met his ear.</p>
                  <p>"Stop, Jenny! Cease your howling. My pet, don't cry so! Lucian, listen to
                     me—you've upset my whole household, young man! What are your plans? What do you
                     anticipate doing?"</p>
                  <p>"I scarcely know, sir; I shall try to get a clerkship of some kind. I am
                     sufficiently educated for that, I suppose, though I am no scholar."</p>
                  <p>"You are pretty fairly advanced, as education goes usually," said Mr. Laurie;
                     "I can see you have had good instruction. Have you ever worked before?"</p>
                  <p>"Two weeks on the levee as a stevedore," said Lucian. "I broke down at that;
                     but I shall get some indoor work if I can, now."</p>
                  <p>"Have you no friends?"</p>
                  <p>"None that I can call on to aid me, sir"</p>
                  <p>"No mother—no parents?"</p>
                  <p>"I have no mother," replied Lucian, evading the question; "my father is dead—to
                        <emph>me,</emph>" he added in a suppressed voice. "I had rather not speak of
                     my family, sir; they cannot help me. Though there is no disgrace in my past,
                     there is sorrow and misfortune."</p>
                  <p>"Humph! Well, I will not press your confidence. I am in need of some one to
                     read to me. It would be a great relief to poor Annie, for me to have a reader.
                     I like you—I like your voice. I think it would be advantageous to you to read
                     with me. You are only seventeen, you say—a year, or even more, of quiet study
                     would be valuable to you. I will give you five hundred dollars per annum, and
                     you know your position already in my family. How will that suit my darling?
                     Will it please you?"</p>
                  <p>The last words were spoken to Margaret. Margaret threw her arms about his neck,
                     covering her grandfather's face, and his sightless eyes with grateful kisses:
                     "Oh! you are the dearest, lovingest, sweetest, most precious of grandpas,—and I
                     am so glad, so glad!"</p>
                  <p>Margaret danced off to Lucian, with both hands extended in ecstacy of
                     delight.</p>
                  <p>"Now you will stay. Won't you, you dear Lucian?"</p>
                  <p>Lucian caught the charming child in his arms, and laying his head on her
                     shoulder, burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"Poor Lucian! Poor Lucian!" said Margaret, soothingly patting his head as it
                     lay on her shoulder; "I am so glad! You belong to us now—you belong to me—and
                     Jenny—as well as Aunt Annie and grandpa! Don't you?"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie thought none the less of Lucian for his momentary weakness. In his
                     sublime patience and quiet resignation the blind man had learned lessons of
                     sympathy and charity that were rare and beautiful—and yet Mr. Laurie, too, had
                     his ambitions—neither was he—all-perfect. Alas! who is?</p>

                  <head type="sub">A TRYST</head>
                  <p>ANNIE LAURIE stood on the sea-end of the oblong pier that formed the extremity
                     of the long, narrow wharf, built out for nearly a half-mile from the slowly
                     shelving beach, till it ended in water always deep enough to float a steamboat.
                     On each side was the close-latticed bath-houses. Annie stood alone. The pier
                     was open on three sides, but that fronting the ocean was free and unencumbered;
                     a rough railing and benches ran along one end of it. Annie was leaning on the
                     rail; the strong sea breeze blew her scarf and fleecy Nube with such power she
                     had to fold her arms closely over them to keep them on her breast. It made her
                     long white muslin skirt flutter, giving momentary glimpses of her pretty feet
                     and ankles. Annie loved white dresses and fine linen; she liked pretty,
                     delicate colors in her ribands. To-day her scarf and ribands were rose pink.
                     She looked out on the white gulls winging their swift flight over the waters,
                     swooping to the crests of the water after their prey; at the flocks of
                     water-chickens ducking and rising with the roll of the sea; at the sails of the
                     fisher-boats far out from the land; the setting sun, bringing the snowy canvas
                     into momentary roseate resplendence as the dying rays gleamed on the wet boats
                     rising and rocking and sinking as they ran fast before the breeze, tacking into
                     the shore. One of these was Baptiste's boat; Annie knew the peculiar lateen
                     sail he had rigged it with. Her lustrous eye took in the beauty around her with
                     an intensity of appreciation only known to such a sensitive, impassioned nature
                     as her's; enhanced by its rarity, too, for, in her total self-abnegation, in
                     her absolute absorption of time and society for the solace of her blind father,
                     Annie never quitted the house, except at this short hour of waning evening
                     light. It is a joy to some natures to have control of their own time, their own
                     hours, their own life; a necessity to be <emph>alone</emph> a portion of every
                     day. To be perpetually in the presence of others is very wearying—and
                        <emph>wearing</emph>—exhausting to some natures. It was to such an
                     organization as Annie Laurie's; but she had never belonged to herself, for her
                     life's duties were unceasing and monotonous. She never trusted her father out
                     of her sight during the hours he was awake. She had no life of her own, except
                     at this hour and at night. She lived for others. Her mind so varied, so stored
                     with wisdom of the earth, her heart so painfully impressionable, where every
                     nerve of sensibility was vitalized with a life that duller temperaments would
                     never even conceive of. Her womanliness so exquisitely tender that it made her
                     helpless when her affections were engaged, while it alone was the fountain and
                     source of all that quick sympathy, instantaneous perception, and appreciation
                     of the feelings of others. It was these qualities made Annie Laurie the joy of
                     her fireside; it was she whose emanations of love and truth and gentleness made
                     such an atmosphere of peace and comfort in that house. It softened the manners
                     of the very servants under her gentle, firm rule, and made them mild and
                     pleasant-speaking. Wherever she moved, harsh sounds hushed themselves. No
                     jarring tempers or angers or hasty words asserted themselves in her
                     presence.</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6308-00000033"/>
                  <p>All was joyful now in Annie Laurie's heart. A whole cageful of singing birds
                     had built their nests there, for the present hour at least. The cool breeze
                     invigorated her; the beautiful clouds of sunset warmed her soul, and the
                     steady, rapid footfall she recognized coming up the long planked wharf,
                     hastening after her, brought deeper color to her cheek and smiles to her
                     lips.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments Harold Ashton stood beside her. Annie held her hand out to him
                     without speaking. He took it, then gently drew her down on the bench beside
                     him, and encircled her slender waist with his other arm, still holding the
                     proffered hand in a close pressure. Annie's head sunk on his shoulder; he bent
                     his cheek down on it; they sat silently. In full perfect communion of hearts
                     such as theirs words were needless. Their satisfaction was intense. Moments of
                     speechless bliss come in some lives,—bright diamond spots of joy in long, long
                     dieary wastes of desert life.</p>
                  <p>Annie was the first to break the silence.</p>
                  <p>"It has been longer than usual since you came Harold."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I could not come; this election has kept me busy; I could not get off,
                     you know. I am trying to make a name and fortune to lay at your pretty feet, my
                     dainty queen."</p>
                  <p>Annie turned her head so that his lips could touch her pure forehead; he had
                     been raining kisses on her soft brown hair.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Harold, I am not the only mistress of your heart or thoughts. I know how
                     ambitious you are. Perhaps it is pride for me, dear, but I fear I have a rival
                     near the throne. You find you have the power to move men, to control them.
                     Don't you like power, Harold? You know you always did. Don't you suppose I read
                     the papers? Don't you know that I see very, very often the mention of Harold
                     Ashton taking part in politics, making stump-speeches, going to caucusses; and
                     very often have to skip over the notices, because you do and say things, in
                     your extreme democracy, that would not suit papa at all, who retains his old
                     federalism? Oh, Harold, you are a thorough American. Like the ancient
                     Athenians, you all must take part in the government of the state and
                     country."</p>
                  <p>"Don't you like it, Annie? Would you have me otherwise, my darling?"</p>
                  <p>Annie answered thoughtfully, lifting her head up to look in Harold's face:</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, Harold, I would not like to change <emph>you</emph> in any
                     particular; I sympathize, you know I do," her eyes flashed and color rose; "you
                     know how entirely I understand every aspiration and ambitious hope of your
                     soul. But, darling Harold, I would rather you desired still to be a great
                     lawyer, to be eminent at the bar, than to seek the changing honors of political
                     life. History teaches us that it is hard to keep one's soul unsullied in that
                     corrupt atmosphere. You are so gifted, so full of all that kind of talent that
                     pleases and attracts popular applause, that I fear, dearest, lest you should be
                     blinded by the glitter of these momentary stage lights—these crowns of
                     histrionic approval, which will fall so abundantly on your dear head. You were
                     made for higher, greater, better fate than that, my Harold—my king among
                     men!"</p>
                  <p>If there was slight reproach in Annie's speech, there was so much pure love
                     mingled with it, that Harold took no exception at it; he only kissed the
                     crimson lips of the noble, eloquent girl, and held her in a closer embrace.</p>
                  <p>"Annie, I know you are right, but it is so enticing; this power of seizing and
                     holding a multitude in one's grasp, that I find myself perpetually tempted,
                     continually straying off to seize the transient cup of excitement, when I know
                     it would be better to keep aloof. I <emph>have been</emph> rather neglecting my
                     true business, and taking a more active part against this know-nothing party
                     than I meant to; but I'll try to do better in future. Now smile, sweet
                     heart—don't scold any more."</p>
                  <p>"Scold <emph>you,</emph> Harold!" murmured Annie, with a look that provoked
                     another embrace. Annie shook her head with a sigh, as she laid it back on
                     Harold's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Harold, are you not frightened sometimes when you remember how entirely I love
                     you? Does the holding of my heart in your hands so absolutely, as you know you
                     do, give you no uneasiness? Sometimes it frightens me to see what you are to
                     me!"</p>
                  <p>"Does it? Ah, I am not so easily alarmed, my pet, my precious darling," said
                     Harold, with a keen flashing smile. "Think how long, long it was before I could
                     make you acknowledge you loved me at all! Do you remember my cold pupil? Do you
                     recall those years of silence and suffering on the part of your reserved,
                     constrained teacher? Do you know how I, watched and longed, month after month,
                     year after year, feeling that you had grown to be the very soul of my soul, for
                     one look of sympathy, one word of affection, to keep my hungry heart from
                     starving—and it never came!"</p>
                  <p>"And yet I loved you all the time," observed Annie, quietly. "I have never
                     loved any body but you; never!—from the time you began to teach me, I loved
                     you—only you!"</p>
                  <p>"Little iceberg that you were," continued Harold, "even Louise discovered my
                     secret, with those fiery eyes of hers, flashing every where. <emph>She</emph>
                     compassionated me; but you—you proud, self-contained, true woman! you let year
                     after year roll on, conscious of my mad passion, for so it seemed; but not a
                     word, not a crumb of pity to feed my hungry heart, would you vouchsafe. I
                     believe you would have died and made no sign, from your ideas of duty to your
                     father, had not those words of frantic passion and grief rushed from my lips,
                     when I thought we were parting for ever! I was nearly crazy from jealousy of
                     Edward Morris, whom your father still wants you to marry."</p>
                  <p>"And whom you know I never will marry," said Annie, tranquilly.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Annie, I don't know; sometimes when I am absent from you, strange thoughts
                     come into my head, that the devil himself seems to whisper! Your father is so
                     anxious for that match! He is devoted to Edward; and with all his goodness, you
                     know, Mr. Laurie is fixed in some prejudices. It is, I acknowledge, a suitable
                     marriage for you; a man you have known all your life, and his family before
                     him, friends and hereditary neighbors. Morris is a handsome, attractive man;
                     rich, educated, fascinating; all that takes a woman's eye; while I am a poor
                     man, full of faults, not handsome, nothing to offer you in comparison with this
                     man. Annie, I met Morris yesterday in a political meeting. The man is an
                     Alcibiades! He enthralled the crowd. He affected even <emph>me,</emph> with his
                     graceful, well-turned periods. Annie, Annie, he is a dangerous rival to any
                     man; he has loved you for years!"</p>
                  <p>"I love you," replied Annie.</p>
                  <p>Harold pressed the bright head closer, but he went on:</p>
                  <p>"Annie, these thoughts have troubled me much lately. I hate to struggle against
                     my own jealous nature—against—" he hesitated; Annie smiled, and repeated softly
                     some lines they had read together, the words of Inana to Don Diego, when he
                     expressed jealousy in Lope's Drama: <q>

                        </lg>
                     </q> Harold replied from the same play: <q>
                        <lg type="stanza">

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Annie laughed. "Hush, Harold, you have no fear; no reason to be jealous of any
                     body in the world—you must be fully conscious of that!"</p>
                  <p>"When I am with you, I am," he said frankly, "but when I am absent I am not.
                     Annie, I fear sometimes to see Edward Morris; we are not only rivals in love,
                     my Annie, but in what you say is my other mistress—<emph>ambition!</emph>
                     Morris, I can see, is endeavoring to force me into a quarrel with him. He knows
                     how injurious it would be to my prospects as far as you are concerned. How it
                     would annoy and vex your father! It is hard work sometimes, Annie, to keep down
                     the old Adam. You knew, dear, that I am passionate and hasty—I know it; and I
                     do try to keep out of any difficulty with this man, but I believe he means to
                     goad me to it. He will never challenge <emph>me,</emph> but he may
                        <emph>force</emph> me to send him a cartel, and that is what he wants to do.
                     God knows I have no wish to be embroiled with any man; but this man is cunning
                     and vindictive, Annie; I am afraid that——" Harold left the sentence
                     incomplete.</p>
                  <p>Annie looked disturbed: she raised her head from her lover's shoulder, took his
                     hand in both her's, and fixing her large eyes full on his, with an expression
                     he never forgot, she said solemnly:</p>
                  <p>"Harold Ashton, if you ever seek a quarrel with Edward Morris, on my account,
                     you will destroy my every hope of happiness; and if you bring harm, destruction
                     upon yourself, you will destroy my life or my reason. How could I live without
                     you, Harold? you who have studied my nature for years? Oh, Harold, you
                        <emph>ought</emph> to know how my life is bound up in yours! Be
                     compassionate—be considerate—be at least humane, if not generous, Harold!"</p>
                  <p>Harold pressed his lips tightly together.</p>
                  <p>"Annie, Annie, if you could only be with me always! I would be better—more
                     patient. Oh, can't you come, my darling, my bird? Come to me. I am poor, but I
                     can work. To work for you—with you, would be a joy. Come and make a paradise
                     for me; and set these thoughts of despondency and distrust and jealousy at rest
                     forever. Let your father give his money to Reginald and to Margaret—so you come
                     to me. Let me go and ask your father for you."</p>
                  <p>"Harold," said Annie, "I would come to-morrow if I could. But I <emph>cannot,
                        will not</emph> desert my blind, dependent father. If you could come to
                        <emph>us,</emph> Harold, that would solve the difficulty. But you are too
                     proud to do that—you will not. I cannot take my father and Margaret away from
                     their home. My father would not go. Neither will you come to be dependent, you
                     say, on him. What am I to do, Harold? God knows how I love you. But my duty is
                        <emph>first, first,</emph> oh, my Harold, to my father."</p>
                  <p>Harold clasped the weeping girl in his arms, and kissed her passionately.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Annie, it is hard, hard for us both: hardest, perhaps, on you, my dove, my
                     sweetest, patientest, lovingest heart; my own, own darling!"</p>
                  <p>Annie clung to him fondly.</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6308-00000034"/>
                  <p>"Oh, my sweet, I used to think I could teach you; but now you must teach me
                     patience—patience. You see, Mignonne, if I was Edward Morris, it would be very
                     convenient, wouldn't it, having his estate and home adjoining your
                     father's."</p>
                  <p>Harold laughed. "Could you get some good fairy to make us exchange lots—1 and
                     the Alcibiades?"</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense, Harold. I don't think him an 'Alcibiades,'" said Annie, laughing.
                     "His head <emph>is</emph> handsome, but I don't like his figure; he is too
                     narrow in the chest, and—and—"</p>
                  <p>Annie laughed again, but she finished her sentence. "He has such slender little
                     legs!"</p>
                  <p>Harold was better pleased with <emph>this</emph> than anything Annie could have
                     said. He knew no woman could feel sentimental towards a man whose person struck
                     her ridiculously, and he knew, besides, that his own form was admirable. He was
                     all right in the chest and legs, even if his features were not so regular and
                     classic as Edward's. Annie was a wise, sagacious little woman. Harold talked on
                     quite happy after that cruel speech of her's about Morris's extremities!</p>
                  <p>Annie gave Harold a full account of her life—her thoughts and feelings since
                     they last met, and received from him a frank confession of his conduct and
                     life. He laid his whole soul bare before her, with all its noble qualities and
                     all its faults. Sometimes Annie would shake her head reprovingly. Like all
                     impassioned men of rare genius, Harold was mercurial in temper, though constant
                     and true in affection. He talked to her at the full tension of his intellect,
                     with all the freedom of thought that he might have used with a man, with the
                     certainty of receiving not only perfect comprehension of his aspirations and
                     plans, but of getting good advice and sound judgment. He could rely implicitly
                     upon her calm, broad thought, as thoroughly as upon the entire respondence of
                     her rich womanly sympathy.</p>
                  <p>"Annie, Annie," he said, "you are a perfect friend; I find all I want in
                     you."</p>
                  <p>The darkness stole over the earth, as they sat talking. The breeze was growing
                     chilly. Annie rose, drawing her scarf about her as the night grew dark. They
                     lingered an instant to take a parting look at the sea, now silvered with
                     moonlight; then they turned slowly homeward. Annie leaned on Harold's arm in
                     full contentment.</p>
                  <p>They found the family group still seated on the verandah where they had left
                     them. Annie was quickly informed by the jubilant Margaret of the arrangement
                     contemplated for Lucian. Annie was pleased. She liked the young man, and she
                     knew it would be a great relief to <emph>her</emph> to have his assistance in
                     reading to Mr. Laurie. They were all gratified and joyful over this
                     arrangement. Margaret insisted that she and Jenny should go down at daylight
                     the next morning to aid in transporting Lucian's effects, but Mr. Laurie
                     declared that to be unnecessary. Lucian must get his things packed to-night,
                     come up to breakfast, and send down for his trunk and books afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie began to think with interest of conducting this clever young man
                     through some of the intricacies of learning. In his isolated existence, this
                     was a new pleasure. He was eager to begin it. The whole household was excited,
                     and Margaret ran out into the kitchen to tell Betsy that "Lucian was coming to
                     be grandpa's reader, and would belong to them now."</p>
                  <p>Lucian returned to the cottage. Baptiste and Marie regretted his leaving them,
                     but they rejoiced he was going to their good friends, the Lauries.</p>
                  <p>The whole earth and sea lay bathed in God's pure moonbeams. The roses, the
                     oleanders, the white perfumed crape, and the green, night-blooming jasmine,
                     poured forth on the night wind their almost too powerful fragrance out of Annie
                     Laurie's garden. And the mocking birds sat in the orange and crape myrtle
                     trees, and sung the story of their loves all the night long.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A BREAKFAST.</head>
                  <p>THE next morning Lucian made his appearance at the breakfast-table, together
                     with the fresh, fragrant flowers Margaret and Jenny had gotten up at day-break
                     to gather. The blossoms were glistening with heavy dew-drops. The little hands,
                     so white and so black, had been equally interested in tying them up into lovely
                     bouquets, of which one was laid as an offering on every plate, and a whole
                     basketful were piled up in a pyramid of color and perfume, in a snowy parian
                     vase, for the centre of the table. Baskets of colored porcelain, filled with
                     figs of every sort, purple, white, green, yellow, black and brown figs;
                     beautiful peaches, cool, iced slices of yellow cantelope; plates of grapes
                     lying on their own graceful leaflets; red tomatoes; pale, green cucumbers
                     shining through heaped up bits of ice; silver pitchers of red claret, with the
                     frozen ice-drops clinging to the outside of the pitchers; crystal glasses of
                     pure, creamy milk, beaded and frosted; steaming, black, dripped coffee, in the
                     silver grecque, none of the abominable boiled stuff, but coffee black and
                     strong, till it made a mahogany tinge on the inside of the fine, thin cups; it
                     was poured into milk boiled down slowly for hours, till it was rich as cream,
                     bubbling now over the spirit lamp of the silver milk-urn; rolls, white, and
                     crisp, and light as snow-flakes; pure honey in the white comb; fresh butter,
                     yellow as gold, stamped with a pine-apple print; dishes of hot, fried oysters,
                     and fish—perch, flounders, and croakers, and flannel cakes, with the
                     accompanying sirop de battérie, or thicker <hi rend="i"/>quait. All this was
                     part of the usual feast, and awoke no comment, scarcely even a thought of
                     thankfulness any more than the sweet air and bright sunshine that the earth
                     basked in. Margaret's gift of flowers, however, was duly appreciated. She
                     kissed everybody "good-morning," including Lucian. Harold Ashton, of course,
                        <emph>he</emph> was at home here. If Annie Laurie was sweeter in one place
                     than another, it was at the head of her father's breakfast-table. She was so
                     fresh, so pure, so fragrant, so simple; her hair so smooth, her hands so white
                     and so soft! Her whole aspect in her ruffled, fluted, white morning gown, so
                     suggestive of physical and mental purity, when she came from her matutinal
                     bath! It added a fragrance even to such coffee, to receive it from those clean,
                     taper fingers. Harold was very much tempted to kiss the hand that gave him
                        <emph>his</emph> cup. It is supposed he did manage it behind the silver
                     coffee urn, pretending to ask for more sugar. He sat on Annie's left, her
                     father on her right. Margaret's ecstasy had been somewhat subdued, when amongst
                     the letters that Annie found lying on the table for her examination, one
                     delivered its contents in a formal notice from the absent visit-paying
                     governess, of an intention of immediate return and resumption of the direction
                     of Miss Guion's studies. Miss Smith taught Margaret everything but her
                     catechism and her religion. Annie took care of that portion of her niece's
                     education. Annie was what is called a High Church Episcopalian, though a good
                     deal of a philosopher in her charity towards others' opinions. But she taught
                     Margaret firmly what she believed to be true herself—Ritualism and all.</p>
                  <p>After breakfast, the blind father, eager to begin his new, interesting work,
                     the teaching of Lucian, was conducted to the library. Then for the first time
                     in years, Annie was left sole empress of her morning hours. Margaret, after
                     giving some mysterious orders to Jenny, followed her grandfather, uninvited,
                     though not unwelcomed. She was desirous to assist at the examination Lucian was
                     about to undergo. Lucian was not sorry to see Margaret follow them, and
                     ensconce herself with some doll-sewing, on a stool at her grandfather's
                     feet.</p>
                  <p>He felt rather nervous over this first introduction to ethics with Mr. Laurie.
                     Lucian was now established in an easy chair, a Latin book put in his hands—the
                     blind man settled himself in an attitude of fixed attention. Lucian stammered
                     and "balked" at the start, but Margaret leaned forward and slid her hand gently
                     into his. Lucian grasped the small, sympathizing fingers, and went on more
                     boldly; then he was tried in Greek, then in mathematics. Margaret's eyes would
                     often rest questioningly on her grandfather's sightless face, as the lessons
                     progressed. She drew a long sigh of relief when Mr. Laurie eventually
                     pronounced a few words of satisfaction with Lucian's advancement, giving him a
                     general outline of the course he meant to pursue in future reading. Then taking
                     up the passages from memory, that Lucian had read, he began to eliminate them,
                     unraveling the deepest meaning—giving life and color and interest by his
                     "winged words" to these usually dry skeletons of language and science. Lucian
                     was delighted and enthralled; no one had ever taught him so. He no longer
                     wondered that Annie Laurie had become so learned and so fond of study, educated
                     by such a mind as this! Margaret listened patiently, even though she did put
                     her little pricked fingers (pricked, when she had been trying to sew and to
                     watch Lucian and her grandfather at one time) up to her mouth, occasionally to
                     stifle a yawn.</p>
                  <p>But after the examination was over, and Mr. Laurie had selected a book for
                     Lucian to "read," Margaret's anxiety was allayed, her mind at rest. The sound
                     of Lucian's voice rolling out the rich, Greek vowels in luscious tones, came
                     softer and more and more dreamily to her ear. Her doll, dress, needle, scissors
                     and all slipped from the sinking hands that soon lay unclasped in her lap. Her
                     head, with its wealth of ringlets, sunk down on her grandfather's knee, and she
                     slept. Mr. Laurie's hand wandered gently till it found the child's head, and
                     rested there, partly out of love, and partly to keep the head steady and fixed
                     in its comfortable position.</p>
                  <p>Lucian's eye strayed off his book more than once towards the beautiful group,
                     with its graceful surroundings—the noble, blind old man, and his lovely,
                     sleeping grandchild. It made him lose his place once or twice, but he soon
                     recovered it and read on.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, there was a whole morning full of nectar and ambrosia for the
                     two left in the cool, shaded summer-parlor, with its closed venetian shutters
                     and delicate muslin curtains waving in the morning air. They always had so much
                     to say to each other. Harold was perfectly at home in this house, with
                     everything about it, and everybody in it. It had been his summer home for
                     years; there was not a nail, not to say a picture, nor a "hole or corner," that
                     he did not know as well as the rest of them. He knew even the store-rooms and
                     pantries, being a favorite of Betsy's, and the dairy, and even Jane's
                     kitchen—every part of the house was familiar to him, except Annie's suite of
                     rooms; he had paused there, on the outside of her door, many and many a time,
                     as he passed at night to his own apartment on the floor above, after reading
                     late in the library—he had knelt,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6308-00000035"/>
                     where no human eye could see him, and kissed the threshold of her door. It was
                     a joy to him to wander around now with Annie and see all the places associated
                     with his past life. Then what bliss to sit down alone with her in the quiet
                     parlor! There could be no tedium with Annie; she understood all one wanted her
                     to without effort; she was so simple, so responsive, exciting, and yet so full
                     of sweet womanly peace; it breathed all over her and out from her—she was a
                     thousand women in one, so great was her variety—she drew out all that was good,
                     and noble, and true in all about her. She never considered it essential to keep
                     up a perpetual flow of conversation with Harold. There were long, delicious
                     spells of silence, golden intervals between the talk of the lovers. Harold
                     spoke when he felt like it, read when he felt like it, and, it has to be
                     confessed, smoked his cigar when he felt like that, Annie absolutely igniting
                     the allumettes for him to do it. Annie was marking some pocket-handkerchiefs
                     for him; her needle tied lovingly over the initials, and so the morning slipped
                     away for these two. Time flew as fast as if his wings were not dipped in
                     rose-bloom that day. Harold came to his last walk, his last kiss that evening
                     for some time to come.</p>
                  <p>At sunset, Lucian and Margaret, with Jenny, went down to Baptiste's cottage
                     early, in order to be back in time for Annie's walk.</p>
                  <p>Margaret returned in a very excited state over "the baby" that had come to
                     Marie in the night previous. "The dearest, cunningest little fellow, with such
                     soft, soft pink hands, and black eyes like Marie's, who opened his eyes and
                     cried <emph>so.</emph> You can't think, grandpa, what a sweet fellow he is! And
                     Baptiste is so proud! he brought a beautiful cradle from the city today, with a
                     pink pillow in it, and Marie is pleased, and I am to be the baby's godmother,
                     and Lucian godfather, as soon as he (the babe. In Margaret's eagerness her
                     sentences were somewhat convoluted) is old enough to be christened, and he is
                     to be named 'Jean Courtenay,' after Baptiste and Lucian."</p>
                  <p>Lucian followed Margaret with a flushed face. He was truly pleased at the poor
                     fisherman's affection for him, but the consciousness of imposing a name not his
                     own on the innocent babe embarrassed him; but he consoled himself by thinking
                     it was at least his mother's name, and the babe should never be the worse for
                     bearing it, if he could prevent it. His incognito was dearer than ever since
                     fortune had cast him with the Lauries, and he was more than ever resolved to
                     maintain it till he should come of age.</p>
                  <p>Jenny was all smiles and white teeth, "she had rocked the baby in the new
                     cradle." There was a buzz all over the household over Marie's babe. Harold
                     escorted Annie down after tea, to ask after the good humble mother. Then the
                     lovers walked on the pier to take a parting look at the sea. Annie was more
                     frank in acknowledging her love for Herold than she would have been had their
                     positions been reversed, had he been the wealthy, prosperous one. But Harold
                     had all the sensitiveness, jealousy, pride that accompanies a well-born
                     Virginian, belonging to a good but decayed family. Annie knew how magnificent
                     his talents were; she was willing to wait on their development, and she loved
                     him idolatrously, so she told him so, whenever he wanted to hear it.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE CHRISTENING.</head>
                  <p>MISS SMITH was come. Lucian saw an amiable, companionable woman of thirty-eight
                     years; tall, very stout, and weighing two hundred pounds. She was well looking,
                     well preserved. She wore small dress caps on the back of her hair, and stiff
                     curls in front in rows, one lower than the other: a style of coiffure not
                     unbecoming to her. She was warm-hearted, but reserved, firm and strict in ideas
                     of duty, very determined in regard to retenue and proper deportment. Her eyes
                     were dark, her features regular,—altogether a well-moulded Junoish sort of
                     middle-aged woman, who had never committed any impropriety or solecism in her
                     whole life. Miss Smith was highly esteemed by the family. Lucian grew to be
                     very fond of her in time, though she rather impressed him with awe when he
                     first met her. Margaret loved her, but she got very weary sometimes of the
                     stricter confinement to which she was now subjected in comparison with the
                     negligent habits of vacation.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lucian! it was much nicer having you read to me under the old oak tree,"
                     she would say. "I do get <emph>so</emph> tired of French, and practising, and
                     grammar, and everything Miss Smith says I am obliged to learn, that I don't
                     know what to do."</p>
                  <p>Margaret, however, was obedient; did what she was told, and only sought
                     compensation in play hours, in the society of Lucian, and of her dear faithful
                     Jenny. Jenny, too, had been brought under the yoke: had been given over to
                     Betsy for tuition in needle-work. Poor Jenny "groaned and sweated" not only
                     under the fardel of her weary life, but also very frequently under the weight
                     of Betsy's hand, especially when her great capacity for sleep provoked a
                     vigorous application of Betsy's knuckles to her head. Jenny was often the prey
                     of distracting remembrances of past joy, and former freedom from tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Lucian was kept pretty closely occupied by Mr. Laurie. The three sworn
                     confederates rejoiced in the moments of daily recreation, when they could take
                     a run to Baptiste's cottage to see "the baby," or wander along the sea shore as
                     happy and careless as motes in the sunshine, in their brief hour of
                     liberty.</p>
                  <p>The "baby" was duly christened. Margaret and Lucian were the sponsors. They had
                     a merry feast. The "baby" was made rich in beautiful presents from everybody.
                     Betsy manufactured a christening cake, with an ornament, procured from the
                     city, a sugar baby, in a candy cradle, rocked by a guardian angel standing on
                     one foot, with extended wings, on a tall (for a cake) sugar pedestal. This was
                     surrounded by a wealth of sugar roses that surprised everybody—they were so
                     very—unnatural.</p>
                  <p>Jenny was in a state of admiration over this chief d'œuvre of "Aunt Betsy's"
                     that defies description. Her face was one broad grin of exultation. She brought
                     a votive offering in the shape of a pair of red and white socks that she, with
                     Margaret's constant aid and supervision, had managed to knit, without once
                     going to sleep over them. The priest changed his surplice after the ceremony
                     was over at the church, and came down in his long, black cassock, to join the
                     festivity at the cottage. He flew about in rather a nervous manner at first. He
                     was a poor little mission priest: one of those meek, bashful, earnest men that
                     abound in new or thinly-peopled countries.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie soon magnetized and quieted Father Hennessy, and got him seated by
                     her side in a flood of talk on the different forms of administering baptisms
                     that had prevailed throughout the world; the antiquity of the right—it having
                     existed among the priests of Baal, where the proselytes—even among the
                     Druids—were always washed by the priests, and presented with white robes in
                     honor of the sun; of its use by the Pagans—by all religions—by the Jews, as a
                     token of purification, until our blessed Lord, taking this merely human
                     observance, elevated and consecrated it, making it the door of entrance into
                     his visible kingdom, and a channel of communicating divine grace.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie, as we said, was "very High Church." The little priest got along
                     very well with her. But so a Brahmin, or a Mahometan, or—in short, anybody
                     would have done. She would have talked with the Brahmin about the
                     Incarnation—of which he acknowledges so many, though she only one—of Káledasá,
                     and his wonderful dramas—of transmigration—of all the strange, sublime,
                     fanciful mystic notions of Hindoo philosophy and literature. With the Mahometan
                     she would have spoken of "the one God," whom they both adored—though she
                     acknowledged the Trinity in that One, and he did not; she would have talked of
                     Averrhoes, and the school of Arabic philosophy, which lighted the fires of
                     analytic altars, and led step by step to modern discoveries. Everything
                     interested Annie Laurie. She had a thirsting for knowledge of men's creeds, to
                     know what they believed, and why. She respected every human soul: nobody was
                     insignificant to her that God had taken the trouble to create; she had
                     prejudices against no one, and against nothing. She believed in Christ, because
                     she found it the most reasonable faith—less objection to be met in receiving
                     the Christian religion than in its negation. It was the <emph>only
                        philosophy</emph> that harmonized the world to her, and, being a woman, it
                     suited her instinctive consciousness of weakness and necessity.</p>
                  <p>After reading all the works of Infidels and Deists, she said once, with a
                     smile, to Harold Ashton, "The Christian will have to go to the Lions, Harold! I
                     can't <emph>afford</emph> to give up my Divine Saviour! I feel the
                        <emph>need</emph> of expiation of divine interference in behalf of this
                     benighted world, and even of the miniature world of my heart!" and taking up
                     her Plato, she read him in Greek the sixteenth paragraph in The Statesman.</p>
                  <p>"See how early the thought of the need of a Divine mediation came even to the
                     natural philosopher, Harold. Lord Bacon is right, when he says—'It is true that
                     a little philosophy inclineth men's minds to Atheism, but depth in philosophy
                     bringeth men's minds to religion.'"</p>
                  <p>One would rather say with Epicurus, Annie, "Non Deos vulgi negare profanum; sed
                     vulgi opiniones diis applicare profanum," said Harold.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Annie and the little priest talked away charmingly, until they were
                     invited to join the guests in the room, which had been Lucian's, where the
                     feast was spread. Marie was full of sweet, vivacious joy. Jenny was ensconced
                     in a corner rocking the hero of the festival in his new cradle, and persuading
                     him into a state of blissful repose. The babe slept, with the pearly milk drops
                     clinging still to his rose-bud, open mouth. Baptiste was overcome with love for
                     his wife, pride in his newly christianized son, and gratitude for the
                     condescension of his guests—his honored friends!</p>
                  <p>Lucian was very gay. Only once the remembrance of his sister, flashing across
                     his mind, made him mutter, "Oh! if Lucia were only here, and could know these
                     good, good people!"</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith looked a colossal statue of approbation, rustling around in a black
                     moire antique, trimmed with honiton lace, and a bran new dress cap, with long
                     ribons.</p>
                  <p>Margaret's fair face was a resplendent mirror, reflecting everybody else's
                     satisfaction. The little priest said a short Latin grace, and supper was duly
                     enjoyed.</p>
                  <p>Margaret gave her grandpa a vivid description<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000036"/> cription of the whole brilliant affair when she
                     returned home, and she also presented him, in the name of her godson, with that
                     portion of the cake which sustained the sugar cradle.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie had the sugar baby carefully deposited on a table in the library,
                     but the mice, one regrets to record, nibbled it down in the course of that
                     night to a Torso, and Jenny demolished the rest.</p>
                  <p>The summer waned. In October the Lauries broke up this establishment, leaving a
                     servant to look after things, and putting the house under the superintendence
                     of Baptiste, they removed their Lares and Penates, and went back to Natchez,
                     where they resided always in winter. Lucian stopped in New Orleans for a day,
                     promising to follow the family, as soon as he had seen his friends there. He
                     found "Jacob Doddson" flourishing like a green bay-tree, driving himself into
                     both fame and fortune, among the dray-men on the Levee. Lucian went to see Dr.
                     Rock, at his office, found him absent on business; so he left a note, telling
                     him "he would never, never forget all the kindness he had received from him,
                     that he was going to live with a gentleman as a reader, that he was perfectly
                     well, and so grateful to Dr. Rock!"</p>
                  <p>Recollecting that the doctor would not understand his change of name, he signed
                     it with that that the doctor knew, "Edward Montague."</p>
                  <p>Lucian saw, by placards, that there was to be a political meeting that night at
                     the Odd Fellows' Hall. There were to be a number of orators speaking, opposed
                     to each other. So he went to the meeting. The Democrats were speaking against
                     the American or Know-nothing party, which had sprung up like a toadstool among
                     the ruins of the old Whig party. The country was in a very restless state.
                     Lucian recognized Harold Ashton among the orators of the Democrats. He was
                     exceedingly interested when, after listening to one of the opposition, the cry
                     arose for "Ashton, Ashton," among the crowd. The man who had spoken last turned
                     gracefully towards the rival who was to follow, by popular will, and clapping
                     his hands, added his voice to the clamor of the mob, calling also for "Ashton."
                     This pleased the easily-excited crowd, it seemed generous and courteous, and
                     when a voice sung out, "three cheers for Edward Morris," they were given with
                     enthusiasm. Lucian took a quick survey of Morris. He was a man of rather more
                     than middle height, evidently a man of the world—of refinement; with straight
                     Greek features, brown hazel eyes, clear cut English whiskers, making a toute
                     ensemble not to be despised by any one, and evidently <emph>not</emph> despised
                     by the owner, who was simply but carefully dressed, and whose every look showed
                     full appreciation of the advantages nature and art had gifted him with, while
                     at the same time there was nothing unpleasant or presumptuous in the young
                     man's manner—one only saw he had been a favorite of fortune all his life, and
                     that he <emph>knew it.</emph> And so he had been; born to wealth, gifted with
                     brains, education, grace, beauty and wit. Hitherto Edward Morris never doubted
                     his ultimate success in any scheme that he took in hand. He had to learn his
                     first lesson of disappointment yet. Lucian was pleased with his speech; it was
                     graceful, persuasive, easy, sophistical, portions of it imaginative—altogether
                     a scholarly effort. Morris was very well satisfied with himself. Ashton had
                     listened intently with changeful face, while Morris was speaking. Lucian had
                     observed <emph>that;</emph> he had a good view of the rostrum from his seat.
                     Ashton stepped quickly forward when summoned by the crowd. Lucian felt a slight
                     tremor pass over him—he was so interested in Ashton, on Annie Laurie's
                     account—he bit his lip, involuntarily; there were certainly advantages; in
                     favor of Morris's <emph>appearance.</emph> Ashton did not look as well, after
                     that Belvidore form, as he did at Mr. Laurie's breakfast-table; Lucian realized
                     that he was too tall, too angular, too slender, too light-colored altogether in
                     comparison with the warmly-hued Phœbus, who had just filled the central point
                     of the picture before him—his features were irregular, his mouth large—trifles,
                     but they affected Lucian uncomfortably in behalf of his friend's friend. Harold
                     began to speak—low, calmly, coldly, but his full, rich voice again exercised
                     its magic, and Lucian found his attention arrested instantly. Quietly the
                     speaker went on, taking up sentence after sentence of Morris's speech,
                     unraveling, disjointing, dissecting it with a clear intelligence, a regular
                     progression, a fine analysis, a keen satire, that Lucian had never heard
                     equaled; and when at last, after dismembering the entire tissue of argument
                     held by Morris, Harold made an episode of broad humor, travestying the whole
                     oration, forcing the crowd to laugh, with furious applause, Lucian was
                     delighted. Then Harold turned on his adversary, his lance truly in rest;
                     stepping forward, with one hand lightly extended, his face ablaze with fine
                     inspiration, he broke forth in a peroration of indignation, anger, pathos and
                     appeal that electrified the whole house; which made all the speakers, adherents
                     and opponents, crowd around him—made the crowd start to their feet—made tears
                     of excitement stream down Lucian's cheek, as he sank down on his seat,
                     overpowered with emotion. Ashton's voice was lost at his conclusion in
                     tumultuous cries of admiration and approval from the vast assembly. Lucian said
                     to himself, as he slipped out of the crowd, not waiting to hear any more
                     speeches—"I don't wonder she loves him so!"</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE LAURIES AT HOME.</head>
                  <p>THE "Charmer," for so was fancifully named the boat that transported Lucian,
                     two days' later up the broad river, reached Natchez just at sunset. Lucian
                     found a carriage and servants of Mr. Laurie's waiting for him at the landing
                     "under the hill." The family had become already established in their winter
                     home, which, during their periodic stork flight, was always kept in readiness
                     for their reception at any hour. When the carriage, it was an open brette, (the
                     fashionable <emph>afternoon</emph> carriage for driving at Natchez,) reached
                     the top of the long hill, at least five hundred feet in height, round which the
                     road wound on an inclined plane, up to Natchez "on the hill," Lucian chancing
                     to look behind him, could not refrain from uttering an exclamation at the
                     beauty of the view.</p>
                  <p>The coachman, thinking that Lucian spoke to him, checked his horses. Lucian
                     stood up in the carriage and looked down to the river, rolling its vast volume
                     of waters at the foot of the bluffs. The village of Natchez, under the hill,
                     was clustered close to the water's edge; the bluffs rose precipitously
                     garnished with pine trees and locusts and tufted grasses; the vista here
                     terminated in Brown's beautiful gardens, gay with flower-beds, and closely
                     clipped hedges. Far away over the river stretched the broad emerald plain of
                     Louisiana, level with the stream, extending for many, many miles, its champagne
                     chequered with groups of white plantation houses, spotted with groves of trees,
                     rich in autumnal beauty, glowing with crimson, gold and green, softened by
                     veils of long grey moss. This plain was dotted with lovely lakes, whose waters
                     shone in the slanting rays of the declining sun like so many great rubies in a
                     setting of smaragdus. The sun went down quickly, as he does at sea, a round,
                     red, fire ball, while light, splendid clouds of purple, pink, lilac, and grey
                     on the blue, blue heavens refracted the ascending slender, quivering rays of
                     the disappearing orb. The type of Deity in all natural religions—the Totem of
                     the Natchez Indians!</p>
                  <p>The "Charmer" was moving off, under full head of steam, up the river, and
                     numbers of skiffs and small boats were plying about over the broad Mississippi.
                     Lucian gazed with delight on all this beauty—then seeing the night coming on
                     fast, he bade the coachman drive on. They had some distance to go, nearly two
                     miles out of the suburbs, before they could reach their destination. They drove
                     rapidly up the streets of the village, for the town itself was scarcely more
                     than through the suburbs, of handsome residences, whose gardens, all adjoining
                     and dovetailed into each other, almost realized the descriptions of Damascus,
                     that queen of the desert, with its triple chain of gardens, its necklaces of
                     "paradises". Lucian was confused and excited by the rapid motion of the
                     carriage, rushing on through acres of bloom, perfume, foliage and verdure;
                     passing here and there the glimmering white pillars of stately houses, in most
                     of which lamps began already to burn and glow, and throw out long, narrow
                     shafts of penetrating light on the darkness, glittering through the glossy,
                     shining leaves of the evergreen lauri amandi, the native almond laurel, and
                     casting a cheering radiance over the wayfarer as he passed along. Notes of
                     music, and singing of sweet voices, and the gay laughter of little children
                     sounded on his ear and died into silence instantaneously as the carriage rolled
                     by.</p>
                  <p>Beloved city—bright city of "the sun!" How often have I paced, with restless
                     child's feet, the road that Lucian was now traveling over, and listened, as he
                     did, but more lingeringly, to the sounds of gentle human life, stirring within
                     thy peaceful homes! How often have I thanked God for my beautiful childhood's
                     home—for my precious Southern land—for its sunshine, its verdure, its forests,
                     its flowers, its perfume; but, oh, above all, for the loving, refined<pb
                        n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6308-00000037"/> intelligent, gentle race of people it
                     was my great, my priceless privilege to be born amongst—a people worthy to live
                     with,—yes, <emph>worthy to die for!</emph> The stern besom of war has swept
                     over you, beloved Natchez—your fairest homes have been desolated, your lovely
                     gardens are now only remembrances—your family circles are broken up—your
                     bravest sons are sleeping in the dust of death, or weeping tears of bitterness
                     in exile—your daughters, bowed down with penury and grief, are mourning beside
                     their darkened firesides—your joyous households transferred to other and
                     kindlier lands. The forms of my kindred faded into phantoms of the
                     past—strangers sit now in the place that once was mine; but yet, thou art
                     lovely, still beloved in thy ruin, in thy desolation—city of my heart—city of
                     my love—city of my childish joy! Oh! city of my dead!"</p>
                  <p>The carriage stopped suddenly at a gate; the footman swung it open, the two
                     leaves flew back with a clang; the carriage proceeded at a slower pace through
                     an avenue, or rather wound through "a piece of woods," that an Englishman would
                     call a park. It was almost a hundred acres of primeval forest trees, under
                     which the red man had often danced, consisting for the most part of oaks,
                     white, red, tin, and water oaks, with mixture of hickory, gum, maples,
                     magnolias, and the cucumber tree, with its umbrella-like top, its immense leaf,
                     and the enormous white vase, seated in the centre of radiating foliage, like a
                     huge chalice of perfume, handsomer even than its sister, the magnolia
                     grandiflora.</p>
                  <p>Natchoz is in the temperate, not the tropical zone; so there is exaggeration in
                     the fanciful descriptions of its climate and productions, as given by
                     Chateaubriand and Lady Georgiana Fullerton; but it is a warm, bright, sunshiny
                     place, with marked and changeful, though not extreme transitions of temperature
                     and seasons. Its pleasant, gently rolling hills and dells, are laughing and gay
                     with blossoming trees and shrubs; the old earth breathes forth flowers from
                     every rough pore; not heavy, stupefying, deeply-colored tropical bloom, but
                     great luxuriance of fresh, delicately-tinted blossoms of all hues and forms,
                     spreading successively their capricious, flaunting beauty, mantling the old
                     mother anew with every morning's light. The wild flowers there are worthy of
                     being the subject of Adelbert Dietrich's delicate pencil, or of Miss Prescott's
                     glowing word-painting. One need only describe faithfully what exists, not
                     attempting to heighten or exaggerate with human imagination or invention, what
                     God has made so lovely—to paint attractive pictures of those "magnolia" hills,
                     and of the park through which Lucian was now being driven.</p>
                  <p>When the carriage entered the smaller circle of fencing, that enclosed the
                     house and gardens, the noise of the wheels grating on the gravel of the drive,
                     caused the heavy doors of the portal to fly open, and Margaret and Jenny,
                     forestalling the decorous servant, emerged from the gloom and advanced to
                     welcome the traveler. Margaret looked like a fairy standing in the moonlight,
                     her red brown hair clouded about her; and Jenny, who was as usual all dusk,
                     except the curd-like teeth and shining eyes, might have passed very well for
                     her attendant dwarf. Jenny was small of her age, and had elfish ways. Her
                     peculiarities of appearance were heightened, on this occasion, by costume; she
                     sported a large white apron with a wide ruffle, much too long for her, really
                     borrowed from Betsy for the purpose of adornment, a white handkerchief, tied on
                     her head turban-fashion, tall as a dervish's cap, a long strand of blue glass
                     beads around her neck, a pair of immense gold ear-rings, and her broadest and
                     widest grins.</p>
                  <p>Margaret cast her arms about Lucian's neck, and kissed him as if he had been
                     her brother—Jenny shook hands very warmly. Lucian could not repress a smile of
                     amusement, when he stepped into the lighted hall, guided by Margaret's clinging
                     hand, and saw how Jenny had gotten herself up in his honor.</p>
                  <p>"This way, Lucian, this way," said Margaret. "Not up the staircase," leading
                     him, as she spoke, beneath the flight of stairway which led up into the gallery
                     of the first story. Margaret led him then through a hall level with the ground,
                     paved with black and white marble, which ran under the arch of the stairways.
                     "Here they all are, in here. You know this is such a queer old Spanish house!
                     You'll soon find out all about it, though it <emph>is</emph> puzzling at
                     first."</p>
                  <p>The newly-arrived guest was kindly received by Mr. Laurie and Annie, who were
                     sitting alone near a blazing wood-fire, in the family parlor. The nights were
                     too chilly for the blind man, even at that early period of the fall.</p>
                  <p>"Come to the fire, Lucian," he said; "one gets cool riding, and this old house
                     of Guyoso's is damp as a basement, almost. I think a fire is comfortable!"</p>
                  <p>They had waited tea for Lucian. Annie had it brought in now. Lucian's heart
                     swelled with thankfulness at the friendly attentions he received from them all.
                     He had never known a <emph>true</emph> home fireside before. Lucia and he, with
                     Cousin Vail, were surrounded with a quantum sufficit of stately splendor and
                     bodily comforts in the grand drawing-room at the Hurst, where they had usually
                     spent their evenings in awe and silence, in their father's presence; but this
                     cordial, genial family communion that formed the golden thread in the everyday
                     day life of the Lauries, he had never known before. It was Annie Laurie who
                     made it. She was the Ariadne who held the end of the clue in the labyrinth of
                     those diverse human hearts, and kept them all straight by means of that
                        <emph>natural</emph> quality of temperament the Italians call "<foreign
                        xml:lang="ITA">simpatico,</foreign>" and of the other <emph>acquired</emph>
                     quality they call "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">educazione,</foreign>"—"sympathy"
                     and "tact or good manners." So few people are polite and
                     considerate—finely-bred—at <emph>home</emph>—many people are so in
                     society—Annie Laurie was so everywhere. Mr. Laurie's helplessness produced a
                     great softness in the manners and voices of his family and household, while his
                     cultivation, and noble intellect, and deep thought, gave a rare charm to his
                     conversation and elevation of feeling to theirs. All was natural, kindly,
                     sincere, and refined about these people.</p>
                  <p>Lucian looked around with some curiosity at the rather old-fashioned, quaint
                     furnishing of the apartment they were sitting in. It was handsome, but not new.
                     On the wall, just opposite, hung the portrait of a man in full armor—a dark,
                     oval face, handsome and swarthy. Annie saw his glance. "That," she said, taking
                     up a lamp and holding it so that the light could fall on the picture, "that is
                     a portrait of Bienville, by Champagne. Bienville was a relative of my family.
                     Here is another of Guyoso, the Spanish Governor of Mississippi."</p>
                  <p>"Hasn't he got a long nose?" interrupted Margaret, disrespectfully.</p>
                  <p>Lucian laughed. Annie continued:</p>
                  <p>"Here's another of Stephen Minor, who was second in command under Spanish
                     domination."</p>
                  <p>"Do you like his uniform, Lucian?" asked Margaret. "It is all red, with yellow
                     facings; and see the big star on his breast!"</p>
                  <p>"I think he is very good-looking," said Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"Here is some gold plate belonging to Vidal, that he brought from Spain to the
                     colony. His whole dinner service was gold—<emph>is</emph> gold, I should
                     say—his descendants, our neighbors, still use it on grand occasions."</p>
                  <p>"And who is this?" asked Lucian, as he examined a small miniature hanging below
                     the portrait of Bienville.</p>
                  <p>"That," said Annie, "is a likeness of our grand-uncle, Philip Noland, who
                     disappeared in 1807, and was never heard of again. He was a lieutenant in the
                     navy of the United States; his wife lost her reason from grief at his prolonged
                     absence. She had just been married, was barely more than a child in years, at
                     the time she eloped with and married Philip against the will of her family. We
                     have some of his letters still extant. He seems to have been an intellectual,
                     but not a good man, from all I can learn. His wife still survives; she is over
                     sixty-five years old now, and has been harmlessly insane since she was sixteen.
                     She lives here, Lucian, in one wing of the house—you may probably see her.
                     Though she is constantly attended by a faithful nurse, and can rarely be
                     persuaded to quit her room, or even her couch, sometimes she becomes restless,
                     and wanders over the house; her mind is usually in a mazed state. We do not
                     confine her at all. It has never been necessary; we only watch her. She goes
                     where she likes usually. Patty is always with her; but Aunt Jane is so old, she
                     does not want to go about much—she dislikes strangers. It is one never-ceasing
                     cry from her lips after her husband. No matter what she may be talking about,
                     in a little while she begins to moan for Philip, and ask where he is—to wonder
                     that he does not come: 'Philip stays so long, he never used to,' is her
                     constant cry. To think that has been going on for fifty years! The love of the
                     woman has survived everything—youth, beauty, reason! Human hearts are fearful
                     things to play or trifle with, Lucian!"</p>
                  <p>Annie spoke earnestly, her cheek turning pale with emotion. Perhaps she was
                     conscious of having the same blood—perhaps the same proclivities to
                     idolatry—deification of those she loved, that had wrecked the life of Jane
                     Noland, and made her useless, save to point a moral to men of this earth.</p>
                  <p>"This phenomenon of insanity is a terrible, inscrutable mystery to me, that
                     eternity alone must solve," said Annie Laurie.</p>
                  <p>Margaret had crouched down on the soft rug, between her grandfather and Lucian.
                     Annie came back to the fire-side after replacing the lamp she held. Lucian told
                     them of his attending the political meeting. When he mentioned Edward Morris,
                     Mr. Laurie roused up with eager interest.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! he is a fine scholar! he speaks well," muttered the old man.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Lucian; "but I like Mr. Ashton much better. He has more vigor, more
                     of the true afflatus. I think him far superior to Mr. Morris, as an orator, and
                     so did the audience."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie's expressive face showed he did not altogether like that remark. A
                     gleam of light passed through Annie's eyes, and her cheeks glowed. The "lamp"
                     was illuminated in an instant by praise of Harold Ashton; but she said nothing.
                     Margaret, sitting in her childish grace, with her hands clasped on her
                     grandfather's knee, spoke hastily:</p>
                  <p>"Grandpa, I don't like Mr. Edward Morris so much! Why do you? He is too—too
                     sugary."</p>
                  <p>They all smiled at Margaret's expression, which all felt to be true, and well
                     applied; at least, all save Mr. Laurie, did; he spoke<pb n="74-75"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000038"/> with more impatience than Lucian had ever seen
                     him exhibit. Turning his sightless eyes towards Annie:</p>
                  <p>"My pet, you do not understand why a man might be too—what you call—"sugary,"
                     that is anxiously desirous to please, and so show himself most amiable, perhaps
                     where less effort would make him better appreciated, and more valued. Mr.
                     Morris is the son of my dearest and truest friends, and I hope will always meet
                     sympathy and appreciation in my house. He has not had the advantages of
                     struggling against the world that Mr. Ashton has had, but I doubt not Edward
                     Morris has ability to carve his name high enough on the obelisk of fame to
                     gratify any ambition."</p>
                  <p>No one contradicted the old man, and the conversation was ended by Annie
                     Laurie's proposing to retire, on account of Lucian's fatigue after his
                     journey.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">PERHAPS—AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.</head>
                  <p>TAKING a candle in her hand, as the servants seemed out of the way at the
                     moment, Annie Laurie conducted Lucian through the hall, up a narrow flight of
                     stairs, out into a wing which seemed of older fabrication even than the portion
                     of the house they had been sitting in. Turning off abruptly into a corridor,
                     she stopped at a door and handed the candle to Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"I know you are not timid," she said smiling, "else I would not tell you that,
                     owing to some repairs going on in the house, we are unable to give you to-night
                     the room designed for you, and <emph>this</emph> is our only legendary
                     apartment. You know every respectable house must have a ghost story. This was
                     also Aunt Jane's bridal chamber. Of course she is never allowed to enter
                     it,—indeed it has been shut up for some years. Here is a bell, however, and
                     servants sleep near. I am just below, and can hear the slightest movement."</p>
                  <p>Lucian assured her he was not at all timid, had no superstition, and believed,
                     "like a good churchman, that human ghosts were safely lodged in the
                     intermediate state, in Paradise or Hades, and did not believe they
                        <emph>could</emph> return to earth, if they wanted to ever so much!"</p>
                  <p>Annie bade him good night. Lucian entered his room, put the light on a table in
                     the centre of it, and looked around him. There was nothing remarkable or
                     supernatural in the room or its furniture. A handsome square four-posted
                     bedstead, with a heavy tester and draperies of faded red and yellow velvet,
                     Spanish colors, chairs, sofas, and toilet-stand to match. A small round table,
                     a long mirror swinging between up-rights of mahogany; over the mantel an oil
                     painting of a young girl in a bridal dress—old fashioned, but very pretty.
                     Lucian thought there was some likeness to Annie Laurie in this face and
                     figure.</p>
                  <p>Nothing remarkable in all this so far! There was a good fire burning on the
                     hearth. Lucian was soon undressed, and after sitting by the fire musing over
                     his strange career, thinking of his darling sister and good Cousin Vail, and
                     with a sad, bitter yearning, of his stern, passionate father, he raked the
                     ashes up over the fire, and jumped into bed.</p>
                  <p>He had been asleep about two hours, when he was awakened by the strange
                     feeling—the consciousness of the presence of some one else in a room where one
                     supposes one's self to be alone. He saw a door that he had not observed, just
                     opposite the foot of the bed, swing slowly open, without noise. The moonlight
                     streamed in, and with the moonlight Lucian saw, or thought he saw, a pale form
                     glide in. He sat up in bed to look at the phantom. It was not a frightful
                     apparition. But still one shudders at the thought of the supernatural in any
                     form. The chill night air blew in through the open door, and made Lucian shrink
                     back on the bed and draw the coverings up over his shoulders. He lay with his
                     eyes stretched watching the shadowy apparition, as she seemed to come steadily
                     on, with her hands clasped together in prayerful petition. She was singing
                     apparently. Lucian would have sworn he <emph>heard her</emph> singing, in a
                     beautiful low voice,—a sad plaintive lament—in a language he did not know. It
                     was as soft as Italian, and full of vowels. The spirit, or whatever it was,
                     appeared in the form of a girl about eighteen;—delicate, blue eyed, regular
                     featured, very fair, and with cheeks flushed as if with fever. Her eyes were
                     wide open, fixed and staring; her mouth half closed as she sang; her whole
                     aspect that of one in deep distress, both physical and mental. The brow was
                     knitted, the muscles of the mouth drooping. She was clad in a long white gown,
                     which fell low, covering her bare feet. Her profuse brown hair hung loose over
                     her shoulders. She came up to the bedside and stood looking down at Lucian,
                     wringing her hands and singing. She seated herself on the
                     bed—singing—singing—always. She bent over towards him. It seemed as if her face
                     must almost touch his. Lucian was not a coward, but he shivered as the pale
                     face bent so near him. He could feel no breath, though her lips were almost on
                     his brow, and her voice rang in his ears as she still sang on. He trembled, as
                     brave as he had declared himself,—those blue eyes were so fixed, so cold, so
                     lifeless,—the whole form so etherial, so white! The girl sang on. Lucian, with
                     a desperate effort at courage and manhood, threw his arms out of the cover,
                     around the tormenting phantom; but he felt his blood congeal in his veins as
                     his arms clasped—<emph>nothing!</emph> and they fell empty on his own laboring
                     breast.</p>
                  <p>The girl was still sitting there singing, undisturbed by his movements. At
                     last, with a low cry, tossing her arms above her head, she faded out of his
                     sight,—singing, singing still. The sad voice died away as it receded.</p>
                  <p>The moonlight streamed in a flood through the open door. Lucian nearly fainted.
                     He sat up again, as soon as he recovered the ability to do so, and continued
                     looking out through the open door into the garden. The tall cedars moaned and
                     sobbed in the wind, almost like the wall of an Æolian harp. The wind blew very
                     cold through the door. After considerable debate with himself, Lucian made a
                     violent effort, sprang from the bed, shut the door, locked it, then stirred up
                     the fire. He lighted the candle, and putting it on a table close by the bed, he
                     lay down and fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>It was after midnight when he was awakened again. He distinctly heard some one
                     breathe hard, as a piece of wood was suddenly pitched on to the fire. Again he
                     lifted himself up in bed to survey the intruder. This was no ghost; it was a
                     little withered old woman, fantastically dressed in a yellow silk gown. She had
                     a feromiére of jewels around her scanty grey hair, long ruby ear-rings in her
                     ears, bracelets on her yellow skinny arms, and rings flashing on her bony
                     fingers, which were stretched out like claws, as she warmed them in the bright
                     blaze of the fire. Her dress was peculiar in cut, made in a Grecian boddice,
                     empire style, with very short waist, broad belt and monstrous buckle, studded
                     with jewels; the skirt was narrow and gored, with short flounces up to the
                     knee; it ended in a long train, which swept on the floor a yard behind her. Her
                     wrinkled, ghastly neck and arms were bare and haggard. Her small feet were
                     encased in fine silk stockings, yellow, clocked with red; her slippers, with
                     high heels and huge yellow bows, were clasped with buckles set with rubies. The
                     firelight and the dying rays of the expiring candle played over this
                     coruscating bundle of gems and bones; for she was so thin, she looked like a
                     skeleton. Her eyes large, sunken, weird, dull with excessive weeping, looked
                     more like dark sockets of extinguished fire than human eyes. Her features had
                     been regular, but the teeth were nearly all gone, and the mouth and cheeks were
                     fallen in. All this was startling and extraordinary to Lucian. She sat herself
                     down on a stool near the fire, and began rocking herself backwards and
                     forwards, looking around her with an evident sort of semi-recognition of the
                     room. She got up and stood in front of the long, swinging mirror, and looking
                     at herself in it, she arranged the jewels on her yellow brow; then turning away
                     she walked all around the room, touching every familiar object with her
                     fingers, as if to convince herself of its reality and identity. Standing before
                     the toilet stand, she pulled out drawer after drawer, but finding all empty,
                     she turned around angrily, calling sharply in a shrill, broken, tremulous
                     voice:</p>
                  <p>"Lola! Lola! Who has been in my drawers? Who has taken my husband's letters?
                     Come to me instantly—come!" She stamped her small feet in helpless rage, making
                     the jewelled buckles on the bows flash and glitter; then glancing around in her
                     objectless, incoherent way, she caught sight of Lucian's wondering face, as he
                     sat up in bed staring at her. He was not at all alarmed this time. He had
                     recognized that <emph>this</emph> ghost was certainly human—that it was the
                     poor maniac, Jane Noland, escaped from her attendant.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Philip! my Philip! have you come at last? You have been gone so long—I
                     thought you would never—never come, Philip!"</p>
                  <p>Saying this in the tenderest, saddest tones, she ran towards the bed, with her
                     skinny arms outstretched, to clasp her be loved one to her faithful, longing
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>Lucian drew back involuntarily. But there was no need; she saw as soon as she
                     got near him that this stranger, with his black hair and eyes, was not her
                     Philip—her fair-haired Philip. With a scream of disappointment, like a child's,
                     she sank down on the floor by the bedside in a paroxysm of grief and
                     despair—lying prostrate, with her hands clasped, writhing, she moaned:</p>
                  <p>"It is not he! It is not my husband! Oh, Philip, where are you? Why don't you
                     come to me?"</p>
                  <p>Just at this moment the nurse entered in the room by the door leading from the
                     corridor, which Lucian had forgotten to lock, and hastening up to the meaning
                     heap lying on the floor, she took Mrs. Noland by the hand, saying gently and
                     persuasively:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Jane, come, let us go see if Mr. Philip is not in the other room.
                     Come—perhaps we may find him—come."</p>
                  <p>The withered creature arose and tottered away, leaning on the arm of the nurse,
                     sobbing as she allowed herself to be led off:</p>
                  <p>"He will never come, Lola; oh, where is he? Philip—my Philip!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian leaped out of bed, and this time secured <emph>both</emph> doors firmly.
                     Putting on his clothes, he wheeled the sofa close up to the fire, and lay down
                     there—his night's repose had been too much disturbed for him to remain hors du
                     combat any longer in bed. Lying on the sofa, puzzling over the strange visions
                     of this night, he dropped asleep<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6308-00000039"/> once
                     more, and slept undisturbed till the sun was appearing in the east, and the
                     door of Aurora's purple house was opened—"et plena rosarum atria," (full of
                     roses the court-yard.)</p>
                  <p>At the breakfast table Annie said, apologizingly:</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry to hear from Patty, the nurse, that Aunt Jane took a freak last
                     night, got up while Patty was asleep, and wandering about the house found her
                     way to her ancient apartment. I regret you were so disturbed. She is perfectly
                     harmless."</p>
                  <p>"Why does she dress so peculiarly?" asked Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"It is her fancy to wear the dress of the dames of her day," said Annie; "we
                     indulge every harmless whim. She likes to keep dressed so for her Philip; I
                     suppose it may have been becoming to her in youth. That is her portrait you saw
                     over the mantel in that room."</p>
                  <p>"She was very pretty once," observed Lucian, looking steadily at Annie, and
                     noticing that the resemblance was strong he had fancied he saw the last night
                     between the portrait and herself.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; though there is scarcely even the frame-work of beauty left now. She has
                     almost wept her eyes out—just think of the grief of fifty years!"</p>
                  <p>"Poor thing!" said Lucian, compassionately; "but, Miss Annie, who was the other
                     spiritual visitant—the fair girl that came in first, singing?"</p>
                  <p>Annie started, and her face changed.</p>
                  <p>"Did <emph>she</emph> appear to you?"</p>
                  <p>Lucian looked at the emotion which her expressive face tried in vain to
                     suppress, with a sudden return of the shudder he had felt in the presence of
                     the supernatural visitant.</p>
                  <p>Annie questioned him closely as to the appearance and conduct of the
                     phantom.</p>
                  <p>Lucian related the whole incident with strict fidelity.</p>
                  <p>"To tell the truth, Miss Annie, I was very uncomfortable; though, of course, it
                     may have been an optical illusion. But it was so vivid!"</p>
                  <p>Annie looked down on her plate, playing mechanically with her fork. At length
                     she smiled, though she was paler than usual.</p>
                  <p>"You remember Coleridge said, 'no mortal could bear to look on spirit—certainly
                     he could not live; the fright would kill him.' Perhaps I am somewhat
                     superstitious myself on this subject; I will tell you the story after
                     breakfast. But you need not be troubled, her visits never fore bode evil to any
                     but the women of my race. I have never seen her myself—I candidly confess I
                     never wish to behold her."</p>

                  <head type="sub">LUCIA VAIL.</head>
                  <p>AFTER breakfast was over, Lucian followed Annie into her private
                     sitting-room.</p>
                  <p>"If it is not intruding on family secrets, will you tell me the story of the
                     singing-girl? I acknowledge myself to be not superstitious, but I
                        <emph>was,</emph> I won't say frightened—but I <emph>was</emph> awe-struck,
                     last night."</p>
                  <p>Annie motioned him to a seat, and began immediately:</p>
                  <p>"It is a sorrowful tale. My father, who holds some Swedenborgian or New Church
                     ideas, in his physical blindness, may perhaps see mentally clearer than we do;
                     he does not like this thing lightly spoken of, especially as my mother always
                     persisted this phantom had appeared to her, on the eve of great calamity. But I
                     will tell you the story: I shall have to go back to the first days of the
                     colony, whilst Natchez was still but a cluster of rude trading houses, under
                     the protection of the fort, built by Bienville. You know this is an ancient
                     dwelling-place of man. Near here was the famous White Apple Village, the
                     principal village of the terrible tribe of Natchez Indians, who called
                     themselves children of the sun; they were a magnificent people, peculiar in
                     having regular laws, and systematic government; they were further advanced in
                     civilization than any of the other tribes of Indians in North America, except
                     the Aztecs; they were feared by all other Indians, and were, to the last,
                     bitter enemies of the white man. Their queens, or female suns, for their chief,
                     Ante Salique, was always a woman, led their lines of warriors to battle like
                     amazons. There are a number of pretty legends still extant about these
                     people—their gallant struggles for their homes and their sacred burial-grounds,
                     are matters of history. Margaret will ride with you, in course of time, and
                     take you to visit the Devil's Punch Bowls, and the site of Rosalie, the old
                     French fort; she will show you the old Spanish barracks, and down on the Ellis
                     cliffs the yawning chasm, leaped by an Indian girl to save her lover, by
                     drawing the attention of his pursuers, who had nearly overtaken him; she will
                     go with you to the immense mounds, upon which was built the temple of the sun,
                     almost as brilliant as that described by Ovid, in his second book of
                     Metamorphoses, or that of On in Egypt. I have fancied some resemblance between
                     the Egyptian worship and that of these Indians. Their temple was barbaric, but
                     it shone with gold and precious metals, and the totem of the tribe was a golden
                     disc with rays. There were but few white settlers in this colony when
                     my-great-grandfather, who was a man of means and education, from some disgust,
                     quitted the colony of Virginia, and moved out here. He had a large grant of
                     land from the Spanish government; he brought out several hundred slaves, his
                     family and all his household gods. Richard Vail, for that was his name, was a
                     younger son of the Vail family of England, who are related, I believe, to the
                     Courtenay's of Devon."</p>
                  <p>Annie paused. Lucian had with difficulty suppressed an exclamation here, which
                     would have destroyed his incognito forever. There had been a tradition, often
                     repeated to him by John Dodd, of a Master Richard, an uncle of old Mr. Arthur
                     Vail's, who, a century before, had gone off to America, and was lost sight of,
                     altogether, by the Vail and Courtenay families. How wonderful that fortune
                     should cast him, a stray waif, into this haven, the house of this
                     long-forgotten relative of his mothers! The fair, unconscious Annie had in her
                     veins some drops of kindred blood. His heart leaped at the thought—it warmed so
                     tenderly to Annie and to dear little Margaret; he wished he could throw his
                     arms around Annie, and tell her, but he dared not betray himself. He knew Mr.
                     Laurie would insist on writing immediately to his father, and once more Lucian
                     renewed internally his vow, never to return to England until he was a man
                     grown, of age to control and protect himself. These thoughts flew
                     instantaneously through Lucian's head; but they could not write themselves on
                     his countenance, except in his eyes, which grew tender as he looked on
                     Annie.</p>
                  <p>Annie caught the expression.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know, Lucian," she said, "just at that moment you looked very like my
                     brother Reginald, though your hair and eyes are darker. But I must hasten on
                     with my story. This Richard Vail, my mother's grandfather, was a kindly, gentle
                     sort of man, as all of his descendants are, gentle in nature, except my cousin,
                     Louise Peyrault, who seems to have got a strong dash of Spanish fire and French
                     vivacity from her father's house. Richard Vail had but one daughter and an only
                     son, our grandfather. His daughter was the idol of his heart, a girl of six
                     years; she was stolen away, or disappeared mysteriously, en route from Virginia
                     to this place. The heart-broken father searched unweariedly in every way he
                     could for years. He never discovered even a trace of her; he came here. At that
                     time Mississippi was claimed as part of the province of Florida. This house he
                     built, as you see, in old Spanish style. Guyoso added to it, but the broad, low
                     basement of brick, surmounted with these frame stories—the staircase, winding
                     up outside in double broad flight—the tiled floors, were designed by Richard
                     Vail. It is queer and inconvenient, but I like it. You know the French or
                     Spanish people never used the entresol for living rooms; the principal floor
                     was the second. You see how much larger and finer the rooms are here than in
                     the story below, where we breakfasted this morning. I use the first-floor for
                     parlors because it is more convenient to me; but my great-grandfather did not;
                     he lived here in handsome style. My grandfather married and resided with him.
                     By some means they ascertained that the lost daughter, Lucia or Lucy, it was a
                     family name (again Lucian moved involuntarily) among the Vails—it was my
                     mother's name and my sister's (Margaret's mother) also. This Lucia Vail was
                     ascertained to be living among the Indians, in the west of what is now called
                     Louisiana—whither the remnant of the Natchez braves had retreated, after their
                     ineffectual attempt to destroy the French and keep their home here—the noble
                     fight they made at the mounds they threw up on the Tensas River, below
                     Harrisonburg, is a matter of history—they fought there with the valor and
                     despair of Spartans, for three days, but at last had to surrender. They stole
                     off in the night from their fort, taking with them their wives and children,
                     and sought a home near Texas. Richard Vail and his son went after the lost
                     daughter, with a company of trusty pioneers. They had a severe skirmish with
                     the Indians, in which the young chief was killed. They got Lucia from amongst
                     the dismayed and screaming women of the Indian village, and brought her home
                     rejoicingly; but she had become an Indian in all her ways,—had forgotten her
                     mother-tongue, spoke only the Indian dialect. She was very much frightened, and
                     tried repeatedly to make her escape on the way; but they watched her too
                     closely, she did not succeed in getting away. They brought her here to her
                     mother; they devoted themselves to her, but she took no notice of them; would
                     walk restlessly up and down that room you occupied like a caged leopardess,
                     wringing her hands, weeping, or singing that low, sad song you heard her sing,
                     with her hands clasped in the most pitiful, beseeching manner. She would
                     neither eat nor change her clothes if they watched her. They would have to put
                     food down where she could get it, and sometimes, if she was left alone, she
                     would eat it; driven by hunger she would eat desperately. Several times it
                     seemed as if she had an idea of starving herself to death. She would crouch
                     sullenly in a corner, and glare at her weeping mother with impotent rage; then
                     she would change her mind, become gentle, pleading, would eat voraciously, as
                     if repenting her suicidal purpose. They had taken her Indian clothing from her
                     and had given her beautiful garments, but she would not put them on. She would
                     wear nothing but that long white nightgown you saw her have on, neither would
                     she wear shoes nor stockings. They had<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6308-00000040"/>
                     taken away her embroidered moccasins; but finding she would not wear the shoes,
                     they put the moccasins back in the room. She seized them eagerly, and put them
                     on immediately. Again and again she tried to escape, tying, on one occasion,
                     the sheets of her bed together to let herself down out of the window; but they
                     baffled all her efforts by their watchful love. Her parents were nearly crazy
                     about her; they did not know what to do. Her mother made herself ill with
                     weeping over her. Lucia, when she saw her mother weep, would throw herself on
                     her knees at her feet, put her hands together, and plead in her soft Indian
                     tongue by the hour, weeping most piteously, pressing her hands to her breast;
                     but no one understood that Indian dialect. Her mother would open her arms to
                     her, imploring her to come to her heart, but the wild creature would wave her
                     back with abhorrence, and point out of doors eagerly, evidently imploring to be
                     allowed to go back to her Indian friends. Of course they did not let her go.
                     This went on for a month. The last time (when they had returned her moccasins)
                     she tried to escape, she very nearly succeeded in doing so; but they caught her
                     and brought her back. When she entered that room again, she threw her hands up
                     with a wild, low cry of despair, as if her heart was broken, and sunk down on
                     the floor. She positively refused to eat now. She lay there all day in
                     motionless anguish. They came to her and lifted her up. She resisted no longer.
                     They laid her on the bed. She began to sing that lament. She sung, sung
                     ceaselessly all night long. They sent for a physician; she was in high fever;
                     she lay with her hands pressed to her bosom, singing, in the saddest tones,
                     what seemed to be a lullaby. The physician, in his examining, removed the
                     small, hot, burning hands, pressed so tightly on her breast. Her gown fell
                     open. The white, beautiful breasts were hot, turgid, and throbbing—hard—filled
                     with coagulated milk! The doctor cried aloud, 'My God! this woman is a mother,
                     and of a young infant!' The parents of Lucia were agonized; every remedy was
                     applied to her relief, but in vain. The grief! the anguish! The milk collected
                     and hardened in the swollen and gathered breasts, increased and developed the
                     fever. The next day Lucia died, perfectly delirious, singing her lullaby to her
                     child to her latest breath. Her voice died away only with her last sigh. You
                     may conceive the distress of the parents. My grandfather started over
                     immediately with an escort of men and valuable gifts, to try and obtain the
                     infant of the martyred Lucia. When he reached the village and proffered the
                     gifts, usually so tempting to savages, they led him silently to the vacant
                     wigwam of the dead chief. There lay, rolled up in softest skins richly
                     embroidered with wampum and beads, a lovely eight-months-old babe, very
                     delicate, and fair as a snow-flake, its long black lashes closed in death. It
                     was the child of Lucia and the young chief. The Indian women had tried in vain
                     to induce the starving babe to nurse at their dark breasts. Accustomed to its
                     mother's snowy bosom, it would not suck them, neither would it eat. It was a
                     frail child, so it soon cried its little life away. My grandfather brought the
                     little body home, and buried the poor thing in its mother's grave. My
                     great-grand-parents never got over this grief; they never forgave themselves
                     for the unconscious torture of their daughter, though Heaven knows they were
                     only unfortunate, not criminal. I will show you Lucia's grave some day; it is
                     in the garden, near that room under that group of cedars.</p>
                  <p>"Since that time, they say, she comes sometimes and weeps in her old prison;
                     and she always forebodes sorrow to the women of the Vail family. Poor Aunt Jane
                     used to have visits from her; of course one attributed <emph>that</emph> to
                     maniac fancy; but my mother—" Annie Laurie hesitated. "My mother said
                        <emph>she</emph> saw her shortly before her own death,—once when sleeping in
                     that room. For that reason I honestly confess I have kept it closed, and
                     avoided using it; but I thought it a foolish superstition. My mother was of a
                     nervous, impressionable temperament, familiar with the legend, of course liable
                     to optical illusion; but you—It is very strange we have had no males in our
                     family with Vail blood in their veins, save my brother Reginald, for two
                     generations. The phantom never before appeared to any other. Redgie never
                        <emph>would</emph> sleep in that room. I cannot explain this apparition to
                     you.</p>
                  <p>"As I said, my father holds some New Church doctrines, and would recognize the
                     possibility of a visible spiritual visitant; but I—" Annie paused thoughtfully.
                     "I would rather be inclined to believe that your outer door had been suddenly
                     blown open; that the singing you heard was the sighing of the breeze among the
                     cedar-trees; that the moon rays and flickering shadows had mingled in a
                     fantastic form that seemed a phantom to your half-dreaming eyes. It is a
                     strange coincidence that you should describe so accurately an optical illusion
                     that has heretofore been visible only to the members of my own blood. Many
                     strangers have slept in that room and been undisturbed. It has been, until now,
                     free from annoyance except for Vails."</p>
                  <p>Lucian did not reply; but he pondered much over the mysterious hallucination to
                     which he had been subjected. He had no desire to sleep again in that apartment,
                     to be visited even by such <emph>dreams.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie continued without observing his silence:</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry I gave that room to you. I am skeptical and unbelieving on such
                     subjects generally. Some day I will try that chamber myself; but in the
                     meantime, I shall have your trunks removed to your own apartment, which is now
                     ready, and will gladly surrender that for the present to its supernatural
                     visitants."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie was waiting, so Lucian went off to read to him. Annie went to
                     super-intend the removal of his paraphernalia out of the haunted room.</p>
                  <p>Lucian could scarcely command his thoughts, or fix his attention on books; but
                     soon as Mr. Laurie began his beautiful explanations, Lucian forgot the poor
                     ghosts.</p>
                  <p>The following night he slept in his new apartment without disturbance, and his
                     life settled itself down into regularity.</p>
                  <p>Margaret was kept very busy by Miss Smith. Annie had more social duties to
                     attend to than she had had during the summer; she was a universal favorite, and
                     had many visitors. This tax upon her time, together with superintendence of her
                     household and devotion to her father, filled up her days, and left her little
                     leisure for anything else; but still she <emph>did</emph> both read and write
                     somehow.</p>
                  <p>Edward Morris, who lived in Natchez, was a frequent visitor, always joyfully
                     welcomed by Mr. Laurie, who seemed to entertain a singularly warm attachment
                     for this young man, which none of the rest of the family shared.</p>
                  <p>Harold Ashton wrote often to Annie, but came rarely. Lucian would sometimes, if
                     he went in that wing of the house, hear the moaning of poor Jane Noland. Annie
                     visited the poor maniac every day, but Lucian never saw her again, and
                     everybody else seemed to forget she was in existence. It is so easy to fall out
                     of our places in man's world, and be forgotten. It is only God who always can
                     remember his unfortunate creatures who steal off in a dark thicket or corner to
                     die.</p>
                  <p>In the afternoons Margaret was permitted to ride with Lucian, accompanied by a
                     groom. She introduced him to all the legendary spots in the environs of
                     Natchez. Lucian was very content with his present condition. The secret of his
                     relationship removed all uncomfortable sensations from his breast, and he
                     received the kindness of the Lauries frankly and heartily. They looked upon him
                     now as one of the family.</p>

                  <p>"MISS SMITH, can you tell me where I will find Margaret?" asked Lucian one
                     Saturday morning, after his arrival at Natchez as he entered the salon.</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith was sitting alone by the parlor fire, a book in her hand, enjoying
                     the otium cum dignitate of the usual holidays.</p>
                  <p>"Margaret! Oh! you will find her in the play-house, Lucian, I expect."</p>
                  <p>"Play-house I Have you a theatre attached to this house?" exclaimed the
                     surprised Lucian.</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith laughed: "Oh, no! I mean Margaret's play-rooms, where she keeps her
                     multitudinous dolls, and other treasures."</p>
                  <p>"And where will I find this treasure-house?" asked Lucian, smiling.</p>
                  <p>"Just outside of the library porch that opens into the flower-garden. You will
                     see there a Lilliputian domicil, painted gray, the windows about a foot square,
                     and the door too low for your tall head. I expect you'll find Margaret with her
                     maid, Jenny, there."</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith resumed her book, and Lucian sprang out of the house, with hasty,
                     joyful steps, to seek his favorite.</p>
                  <p>He soon discovered the fairy house—the doors and windows all canopied with
                     white clematis and yellow jasmine. Knocking gently, the door was quickly opened
                     by the châtelaine herself. A large doll was in one arm, and her hand grasped
                     her gathered-up apron, filled with "doll-rags" and feathers. Jenny sat on the
                     floor surrounded by a chaos of "pieces"—feathers—glass beads, and artificial
                     flowers.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it's you, Lucian! I'm glad to see you!" exclaimed Margaret. "I was just
                     thinking about you, and wondering if grandpa had got through with you. Come
                     in."</p>
                  <p>Lucian ducked his head low, and entered the tiny apartment.</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Mr. Laurie is occupied with Miss Annie, on business; so I have a holiday,
                     too, Margaret."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I am very glad," replied the hospitable lady of the small ménage, "but,"
                     looking doubtfully around at the exceedingly petite chairs and lounges of her
                     drawing-room, "I am afraid," she continued, apologetically, "that you'll have
                     to sit on the floor; my chairs are too little to bear your weight."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! that is delightful!" declared Lucian; "I like to sit on the floor, it is a
                     pleasant variety of position."</p>
                  <p>"La! Miss Marget, let Mars Lucian sit on the table; that'll hold him, sure,"
                     interposed Jenny.</p>
                  <p>"So it will," and in spite of Lucian's protestations, Margaret seized hold of
                     her two feet high four-legged, double-leafed, mahogany table, and with Jenny's
                     assistance, drew it out in the centre of the room.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Lucian, that's a good, strong seat; but you must keep quite still. I<pb
                        n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6308-00000041"/> shan't put up the leaves, because they
                     might break off; and it is stronger so."</p>
                  <p>Lucian deposited himself carefully on his frail throne, then surveyed the scene
                     around him. The room was about eight feet square, had a little chimney and
                     grate for coal. It was carpeted and curtained, and commodiously, even
                     luxuriously furnished—the dainty chairs and sofas quite large enough for the
                     accommodation of Margaret and her dolls. There was a smaller, inner apartment,
                     which was the dolls' bed-chamber, fitted up with rose-wood bedstead, armoires
                     dressing-stands, etc., for the dolls. A huge doll occupied the bed, in a white
                     night-gown, and a number of others in full dress were seated or leaned standing
                     about against the walls of the room.</p>
                  <p>On several small, Japanese tables were vases filled with wild flowers, elder,
                     and yellow wax flowers, and blue and purple phloxes, and crimson buckeye. On
                     the wall hung a miniature library of volumes—fairy tales, and all of the Rolla
                     and Mayne Reid series, arranged on shelves suspended by a red cord.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Margaret, this is exceedingly comfortable," remarked Lucian, after his
                     critical observation; "I like this as much as the old oak roots."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad you do," replied Margaret. "You'll come often to see me then, and
                     I'll borrow a bigger chair from Aunt Annie, expressly for your use."</p>
                  <p>Lucian vowed he enjoyed more sitting on the table as he did now; but Margaret
                     shook her head doubtfully in her courteous hospitality.</p>
                  <p>"But what are you so busy at, with all those feathers about you?" asked
                     Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"I'm making a feather cloak for Pocahontas, my doll," replied Margaret. "I
                     don't know whether Pocahontas <emph>did</emph> wear a feather cloak," she
                     continued, doubtingly. "I expect she wore dressed deer-skins, and embroidered
                     her clothes with porcupine quills and trimmed them with furs; but the Aztecs
                     wore feather cloaks. I was reading about them in my history yesterday. As I
                     haven't an Aztec doll, I thought I would make a Mexican cloak for
                     Pocahontas."</p>
                  <p>"I think you done get nuff yaller feathers, Miss Marget. Why don't you put some
                     these ere pretty red and blue birds' feathers now?" eagerly suggested Jenny,
                     holding out a handful of brilliant plumes.</p>
                  <p>"No, Jenny," rejected Margaret, with instinctive artistic taste; "I don't want
                     to mix the colors so; I will make the cloak yellow and then border it with red,
                     then tringe it with blue. Don't you think that will be prettiest, Lucian?"</p>
                  <p>"Decidedly," enunciated the authority from the table.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny does love red so! Do you think, Lucian, if she did not want to dress up
                     King Nebuchadnezzar altogether in red Turkey cotton last week? but I wouldn't
                     let her do it. Aunt Annie gave me some yellow and purple silk, and Miss Smith
                     braided him a real crimson velvet robe, with arabesque designs in gold braid,
                     and he's splendid now. Look at him."</p>
                  <p>"Do you dress all your dolls in costume?" asked Lucian, looking at the
                     flashingly attired specimens against the walls.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes; most of them. It is so much prettier and interesting, you know; and
                     then I tell Jenny the stories about them—she likes it too—only she will name
                     all her dolls out of Scripture; and that makes it tiresome to have to make so
                     many eastern dresses, they are all so much alike. She has got King David, and
                     Solomon, and Nebuchadnezzar, and Sarah, and Hagar, and Esther; and it was as
                     much as I could do, to keep her from calling one after St. Paul; but I told her
                     he had nothing on but a gray gown, and went bare-footed; so she gave him
                     up."</p>
                  <p>Jenny grinned until she exhibited every tooth in her gums.</p>
                  <p>"I likes Scripter, I does. I likes king Solomon better than Queen 'Lizabeth,
                     and Mary Scotch."</p>
                  <p>Lucian laughed over Jenny's proclivities; but lifting his head rather suddenly,
                     he came in contact with a string suspended across the room, from which dangled
                     a number of queer looking drops about an inch and a half long.</p>
                  <p>"Gracious, I'm getting into mischief, Margaret," he exclaimed; "what's all
                     this?"</p>
                  <p>"Them's butterfly eggs," responded Jenny, quickly.</p>
                  <p>Margaret bestowed a glance of reproachful rebuke on Jenny.</p>
                  <p>"Jenny, how often I have told you they were <emph>not</emph> butterfly eggs. I
                     showed you the eggs, little white, round things, only yesterday."</p>
                  <p>Jenny looked abashed, but obstinate.</p>
                  <p>"'Deed, then, Miss Margaret, I forgits to call 'em puppies; they don't look
                     nothin' like dogs."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Pupae,</emph> Jenny," corrected Margaret—"chrysalids, cocoons."</p>
                  <p>Jenny shook her woolly head in impotent despair over the hard names.</p>
                  <p>"I never can 'member them names, you better let me call 'em butterfly eggs,
                     Miss Marget, as I always is done."</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Lucian, getting up from his seat of honor, and examining curiously
                     the long thread on a level with his chin, as he stood with his head bent; "they
                     are queer looking things, anyhow; where did you get them?"</p>
                  <p>"Take care, Lucian, or you'll crush that lovely saturnia io—it is nearly ready
                     to transform. If you'll come here to-night I'll show you some beautiful moths;
                     just what Jenny calls hatched out—oh, see!" exclaimed Margaret, springing
                     impetuously to her feet, "see, in that corner fanning his wings, what a
                     beautiful Berenice!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian looked and found the namesake of the wife of Antiochus, the loveliest
                     woman of her age, in a large butterly, fluttering, dark red wings spotted with
                     black, a black border, with two rows of white dots. It had evidently just
                     escaped from the chrysalis, the empty, blackish, transparent case being near
                     it.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Lucian, "I never saw a butterfly nursery before! Do you go out and
                     hunt for these things and string them up here?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said Margaret, "Jenny and I go out and gather the chrysalids; there are
                     plenty of those danaus to be found on the fence rails around old fields, where
                     the milk-weed grows; they feed on the milk-weed."</p>
                  <p>Taking his hand, Margaret led him into the sanctum of the dolls' bed-chamber,
                     and showed him, on a table in the corner, a number of caterpillars, some
                     crawling on branches of elm, sassafras, spice-wood, milk-weed, and some already
                     spun up in cocoons. Margaret explained that those in cocoons were principally
                     night moths—the others, day butterflies.</p>
                  <p>Lucian admired the caterpillars, some of which were really beautiful—those of
                     the saturnia io, pale green covered with clusters of short prickles, having a
                     brown and white stripe running on both sides of the body; and the cecropia,
                     three or four inches long, green, with coral warts and short black bristles;
                     and the danaus, a violet color, with brown, red and yellow lines: the chrysalis
                     of this seemed to be a favorite, and no wonder, it was so pretty—the little
                     round green drops embellished with gilded dots.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know the names and habits of all these insects?" asked the astonished
                     Lucian, looking wonderingly at the radiant child beside him, expatiating
                     enthusiastically over the charms of her different caterpillars and
                     butterflies.</p>
                  <p>"I know most of them," she said, innocently. "You see, Lucian, Aunt Annie tells
                     me about them, and grandpa; and it is great fun for Jenny and I to go out
                     Saturdays to look for—"</p>
                  <p>"Butterfly eggs," put in the inexorable Jenny.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," smiled Margaret, "to look for caterpillars and butterfly eggs; and then
                     I string them up—the chrysalids I mean—to a thread, by their little short,
                     black stems, and watch them metamorphose; and we feed the caterpillars and
                     larvæ with the leaves they like best. Aunt Annie has taught me what they
                     like."</p>
                  <p>Lucian screwed up his face with a comical expression.</p>
                  <p>"And so you like racing over sands after sea-weed, and over old fields to hatch
                     butterflies—why don't you have sensible pets—chickens for instance?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, I <emph>have</emph> got some bantams," acknowledged Margaret, "and my
                        <emph>mackaw.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Have you got a parrot, too?" asked Lucian, balancing himself again in rather
                     an alarming manner upon his table, while Margaret resumed her seat and the
                     manufacture of Pocahontas' feather cloak—"and a cat, too, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I have no cat; I don't like cats—they catch my little chickens and eat
                     birds' eggs."</p>
                  <p>Just then a low scratching sound was audiable at the door, and a scream—"Let
                     Jacko in; let Jacko in, Margaret."</p>
                  <p>Jenny opened the door, and an immense mackaw tottered in: a glorious bird, with
                     crimson head, long tail-feathers, and plumes in his wings, of blue and gold,
                     calling out "Marget, Marget." He sidled up to Margaret's chair, and mounting by
                     means of beak and claws, perched contentedly on the topmost round, which
                     brought his fierce looking beak in dangerous proximity to Margaret's pretty
                     pink ears—Lucian thought—but the parrot turned his head to one side, rolled up
                     his eyes, and inserting his bill among the long fair ringlets, said in his
                     softest tones:</p>
                  <p>"Marget; pretty Marget, love Jacko!"</p>
                  <p>Margaret put up her hand, smoothed his feathers, and scratched his head with
                     one finger, saying:</p>
                  <p>"You see Jacko loves me, Lucian."</p>
                  <p>"Everything loves you, Margaret," replied Lucian, with emotion.</p>
                  <p>Pocahontas' cloak being now satisfactorily completed, Margaret proposed a
                     walk.</p>
                  <p>Lucian readily agreed to exchange his rather cramped position in the fairy
                     palace for the enjoyment of an erect posture—so locking up the play-house, with
                     all its treasures of butterflies and dolls, Margaret led the way out in to the
                     garden, with Jacko sitting on her shoulder, screaning out:</p>
                  <p>"Come along; come along, Marget—come along, Jenny; come along. Figs in the
                     garden, boys! never say die!—Mourir pour la patrie—Hurrah!"</p>

                  <p>AMONGST the people who frequented Mr. Laurie's house, Lucian was greatly
                     attracted as well as amused by the eccentric Professor Liebermann. He seemed to
                     be recognized as l'amidu maison, and received in<pb n="82-83"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000042"/> the most familiar manner into the family
                     intimacy. Mr. Laurie was peculiarly devoted to him. Lucian learned to expect
                     the professor every Friday evening with the customary tea. He had his own
                     appropriated chamber in the house, where he would take up his abode from Friday
                     evening until Monday morning. The professor lived the rest of his time at a
                     nominal college, which had been established; that is, large buildings had been
                     erected and munificently endowed, during the early days of the colony of
                     Mississippi, when the little village of Washington, six miles back of Natchez,
                     was the seat of government, and centre of fashion and intelligence—Natchez
                     being simply a port, for the capitol was given up to French and Spanish traders
                     and the Indians. The colonists, many of whom were men of education and
                     cultivation before they removed to these wilds, had endowed this college, but
                     being of all manner of religions and sects, they had desired to preserve
                     perfect toleration, and therefore ordered, in the deed of gifts, that there
                     should always be twelve trustees, representing as many varieties of faith—so
                     the buildings loomed up grandly, but the college never came to anything—it was
                     never successful. The trustees of course existed, and there was kept up a sort
                     of grammar-school, but the bulk of the income went to institutions of learning
                     in other parts of the State; these branches under the control of denominations
                     being found to work more efficiently than the central mother institution.
                     However Professor Liebermann had found himself one day invited to become a
                     member of the faculty of the college. He was a very scientific and learned
                     German, whom the trustees happened to hear of, and accordingly he received the
                     aforesaid invitation, in a majestically expressed letter, signed with the names
                     of all the twelve trustees. The salary was good, not much confinement to
                     classrooms, plenty of time to one's self for study, excellent apparatus of all
                     sorts, a well fitted up laboratory, and a passable library. The professor
                     accepted the invitation. Here he had been ever since, and here he was likely to
                     stay. A profound student, much given to theories and experiments, it was not
                     long before he discovered a like-minded companion in Mr. Laurie, and so he had
                     by degrees grown to be regarded as one of the Lauries, and all his leisure time
                     was spent with them. The professor was an excitable, red-haired man, full of
                     German enthusiasms, but with no German phlegm. He was never quiet unless he had
                     his meerschaum in his mouth, and Annie Laurie had learned to tolerate the pipe
                     everywhere about the house. The professor was a great comfort to her
                     father—Annie loved and thanked him for that. So the shy, awkward, fiery scholar
                     was as comfortable and as much at home as she could make him. If Professor
                     Liebermann had any weakness beyond his laboratory, books and theories, it was a
                     secret tenderness for the stately Miss Smith, but the probability was that it
                     would die when he did, utterly unexpressed. Annie discovered his secret, and
                     often tried to help him on; but he was too shy, it would not do—one glance at
                     his clossal beauty, with her large, well-moulded features, shining black
                     braids, and peach-colored ribands, always annihilated him. Miss Smith, with all
                     her decorum, was not unconscious that she was the object of his homage,
                     although unexpressed, and was guilty, perhaps, of a grand kind of coquetry
                     towards him—at any rate she always assumed her most becoming attire at the end
                     of the week: Margaret noticed that much; otherwise Miss Smith never showed any
                     particular consciousness of the professor's presence—she was too proper for
                     that. The professor was very fond of Annie Laurie, as everybody was; he had
                     watched her grow up from a child, but he did not value her learning very
                     much—indeed, he never thought much about it; she only knew languages and some
                     literature; he was more interested in science than belles letters, and though
                     he found it convenient sometimes to make her translate a Hebrew or Arabic or
                     Saucrit sentence for him, in his mathematical or philosophical reading—he
                     regarded philological knowledge as very superficial, and very well adapted to a
                     woman's lighter mind. He used to forget all about the women when discussing
                     with Mr. Laurie on abstract mathematical or geometrical points; he was
                     perpetually engaged in optical experiments in regard to polarization and
                     refraction of light, in all of which Mr. Laurie sympathized, and into which he
                     entered with great enthusiasm. The professor had been trying for years an
                     experiment in imitation of Mr. Crosse and Mr. Weeks, attempting the development
                     of acari or animalculæ by certain galvanic combinations; he had believed
                     himself to be on the very eve of success—it takes two years and a half to make
                     the experiment—but unfortunately a cat got into the laboratory, during the
                     professor's absence, and in endeavoring to catch a mouse, broke the glass jars
                     containing the ferrocyanate of potassium, which had been acted on for two years
                     by a powerful voltaic pile. The professor had the satisfaction, however, of
                     finding the cat dead from the poison, with the mouse in her mouth. The
                     professor fixed some more jars and started his experiment again, nothing
                     disheartened by Annie Laurie's railery—Annie did not hold the development
                     system. Miss Smith was sometimes startled and shocked at the eccentric
                     pyrrhonisms of her silent lover, and feared he was no better than a pagan; but
                     it was all beyond her depth, painstaking and honest woman that she was—so she
                     knitted on, as quietly as she could, when he would get under weigh with his
                     neolgism, or Hegelism or Spinozaism, or any other Germanism, at which Annie
                     Laurie would laugh, and annoy the professor with most Socratic questionings.
                     Miss Smith kept silence; she was discreet.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WAS SHE A PEDANT?</head>
                  <p>"SOMETHING for you, Mein Herr."</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie deposited on the table before the professor a jar of sweetmeats
                     swarming with tiny white maggots.</p>
                  <p>"See, Betsy declares with the ancient Egyptians, and Mr. Arkwright, and you,
                     that matter, under certain conditions, corrupts into vitality. These damsons
                     were remarkably fine-looking plums three days ago. I saw them myself put into
                     the preserving-kettle and stewed for an hour at least; then the syrup was made
                     and poured over them, boiling hot; it was too much cooked, so it crystalized;
                     then the indefatigable Betsy took the jar, as it was set in a pot of water,
                     adding more of the same fluid to the contents of the jar, and melted the
                     conserves over again. She then stopped the jar, as you now see it, put it in
                     the pantry, where it has remained, we suppose, undisturbed for three days; and
                     behold! see how it swarms with life!"</p>
                  <p>The professor looked contemptuously at the jar and its bearer. He did not like
                     his pet theory to be laughed at. He stuffed the tobacco vigorously in his
                     pipe.</p>
                  <p>"Nonsense, Annie! Betsy is a fool."</p>
                  <p>"Why might not electricity, which you regard as the fundamental principle, be
                     developed in Betsy's plums by heat and fermentation?" demanded the laughing
                     Annie. "If this jar has been opened since it was boiled I did not know it, nor
                     Betsy. Do you think these insects have proceeded <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ab
                        ova?</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>"Tchut, tchut!" said the professor, breaking his indignant silence.</p>
                  <p>He had just illumed his pipe. It was a good excuse for not replying
                     further.</p>
                  <p>Annie saw she had teazed him enough. She went round to him, putting both hands
                     on his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind; I think you are very right to test all these points, and to
                     penetrate into the secrets of Nature as far as you can. It would be a glorious
                     fact to learn; but I fear man never, never will learn God's secrets of
                     vitality,—of creation."</p>
                  <p>The professor, entirely mollified, put one hand on the smooth brown hair bent
                     so affectionately near him.</p>
                  <p>"Annie, Annie, what a pity it is you have spent your time and wasted such a
                     mind on the frivolities of languages, when you have really capacities for
                     science. <emph>One</emph> truth wrested from the arcana of Nature is worth all
                     the literature in all the languages of Babel."</p>
                  <p>"Philology discovers universal truths, sometimes," replied Annie, "and language
                     records them."</p>
                  <p>"That is true," rejoined the professor, as he blew away the smoke settling
                     around his head; "but I do wish you had any taste for abstract science."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, well, I haven't," said Annie, gaily." "I must leave that to your sex."</p>
                  <p>Such conversations were not infrequent between these two, and used often to
                     leave good Miss Smith in a state of utter bewilderment, her lover's heresies
                     alarming her exactly balanced mind very seriously. She was an honest, good,
                     simple-minded woman, who knew how to walk straight by the line of duty; a
                     faithful teacher of what she did know, but of course in a circle which included
                     Mr. Laurie, the professor, and Annie, her acquirements seemed meagre. She was
                     gradually enlarging her horizon of idea, however, growing more doubtful of
                     herself, and consequently more tolerant. But Annie Laurie's was the unfeigned
                     humility of true knowledge. So she never rejected any thought from prejudice or
                     rash and hasty judgment; she respected all that was put forward as truth by
                     others, though she would frequently controvert and decide against it; but she
                     was as unaffected, as sincerely humble and frank as a little child, and her
                     patience was unfailing. The professor said, indulgently, "that a woman was not
                     expected to charm through her learning." He classed Miss Smith and Annie Laurie
                     pretty much together in his estimate of their abilities and learning.
                     Crocheting was as valuable as knowledge of language to him.</p>
                  <p>"What have you there, Margaret, that seems to trouble you, judging from the
                     knitting of your brow?" asked Lucian, looking up suddenly from his book at
                     Margaret, who was seated at a table near him in the library, with a large folio
                     open before her.</p>
                  <p>"It is Richardson's Dictionary, and I am looking at the word <hi rend="i"
                     />pedant," replied Margaret, rather plaintively.</p>
                  <p>Lucian laughed at her melancholy accent, and, shutting up his book, rose and
                     leaned over, looking down on the page with her.</p>
                  <p>"And what have you to do with the word <hi rend="i"/>pedant," said he,
                     mimicking her mournful tone, taking up one of the long curls that fell in a
                     golden shower over her shoulders, and twisting it round his finger."</p>
                  <p>"Are you afraid that you will acquire so much learning that you will become a
                     pedant under Miss Smith's tuition?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I am not at all afraid about myself. The truth is, Lucian, I don't think I
                     am as<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6308-00000043"/> fond of study as I should be; I
                     like to play with Jenny or to talk with you much better than getting my
                     lessons," frankly acknowledged Margaret.</p>
                  <p>"Well, is it on my account you are alarmed?" persisted the laughing Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"No," said Margaret, pausing reflectively. "You like to read, but I don't think
                     you are so fond of study either,—not so fond as you ought to be."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, Margaret," replied the youth, sadly. "I have not studied as I
                     ought to have done; I am not half educated, I know."</p>
                  <p>Margaret turned and laid her hand on his arm.</p>
                  <p>"You are sorry, Lucian, you can't go to college and study, are you not? I shall
                     ask grandpa to send you."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, no, Margaret, you must not; I could not accept. I can study here very
                     well if I would."</p>
                  <p>"No, Lucian," insisted the child, determinately, "you <emph>can't;</emph>
                     neither could I without Miss Smith. You ought to have masters and regular time
                     for study, because you nor I love books like grandpa and Aunt Annie. They would
                     study anywhere; but you or I wouldn't, Lucian."</p>
                  <p>Lucian smiled. "I believe you are right, Margaret; but Mr. Laurie helps me a
                     good deal, and I am trying to make up for lost time. But what was it about the
                        <emph>pedant?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I heard a lady call Aunt Annie so yesterday—that was all; and I thought I
                     would look for it and see what it meant."</p>
                  <p>Lucian's face flushed with anger. "It was a very silly woman who spoke so of
                     Miss Laurie."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Richardson says, 'a pedant is one who assumes or acts the pedagogue.'
                     Aunt Annie never does <emph>that.</emph> But he says lower down, quoting from
                     Ben Jonson, 'Your pedant should provide you some parcels of French, or some
                     pretty commodity of Italian.' Now Aunt Annie can do that, because she speaks
                     French to Marie altogether, you know, and Italian to Mr. Dosinari, the old
                     fruiterer on Main street, whenever she goes to buy oranges. But then, Lucian,
                     so many people in Louisiana speak nothing but French. Are they all pedants, and
                     is Mr. Dosinari one?"</p>
                  <p>Lucian laughed aloud. "No, Margaret, I don't think it is pedantry for people to
                     speak their own languages."</p>
                  <p>"But it is for Aunt Annie. It is very convenient, though, to be able to talk to
                     those people in their own language."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, that certainly is not pedantry," decided Lucian.</p>
                  <p>"Well, then," continued Margaret, "don't Greek women speak Greek, and German
                     people German, and Spanish people Spanish?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, of course."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, that is all Aunt Annie knows, except—Oh, dear me, nobody speaks
                     Latin, do they?" Margaret's countenance fell.</p>
                  <p>"No, nobody speaks Latin now, but most men read it. The Roman Catholies use it
                     in the mass and in all their hymns. It is very useful to know Latin."</p>
                  <p>"And Hebrew. Oh, Aunt Annie reads the Hebrew Bible every day, and the New
                     Testament lessons in Greek. Oh, Lucian, I am afraid it is true—Aunt Annie is a
                     pedant!"</p>
                  <p>Margaret's voice quivered with distress. Lucian laughed, put his arms around
                     her, and kissed the tears from her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, my darling, Miss Laurie is not a pedant, though she is a very learned
                     woman; but she never makes any show of learning, talks of many things besides
                     books, and is the simplest and most unaffected person I ever knew. See here,
                     Coleridge says, 'Pedantry consists in the use of words unsuitable to the time,
                     place, or company.' Now you know that is not like Miss Laurie."</p>
                  <p>"No, Aunt Annie always says exactly what people like to hear,—even old Betsy
                     likes to talk to her."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, never mind what the spiteful lady said. Put on your hat, and let's
                     go look for Jacko and Jenny."</p>

                  <head type="sub">KATIE'S FLOWER GARDEN.</head>
                  <p>MARGARET gave a child's party; and the old house was crowded with merry,
                     bright, young faces, eager for fun and frolic. The entertainment began early in
                     the afternoon. The children amused themselves in the play-house, in the
                     gardens, at all sorts of games, until they were weary; then they came in a
                     troop, surrounding Annie Laurie, who was sitting in the parlor with Miss Smith,
                     Professor Lebermann, and Lucian, who felt himself too old to go with the
                     children, as he would have liked to.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Annie, Annie, please tell us a story," cried all the shrill voices at
                     once.</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith took her crotcheting to the window that opened on the gallery; the
                     professor escaped with his pipe to the outside of the windows on the gallery;
                     Lucian took refuge on a sofa in the corner, leaving Annie a prey to the
                     vociferations and entreaties of the young guests. Annie smiled—she was used to
                     such onslaughts. The children drew all the chairs and stools in a circle about
                     her; and her great favorite, little Katie B., sat herself down at Annie's feet,
                     saying:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Annie, tell us a-be-yoo-ti-ful story, and tell it about me; you told about
                     Florence's cat last time."</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie glanced at the eager dark eyes of the child, lifted pleadingly to
                     her's, laid her white hand on the small head, thickly covered with brown
                     clustering curls, pressed so close to her knee, gazed musingly on the carpet
                     for five minutes, arranging her plot, while the children grouped around her
                     almost held their breath—forcibly constraining every movement for fear of
                     disturbing the train of thought of their improvisatrice—then Annie Laurie
                     lifted up her beautiful, dreamy eyes, and said:</p>
                  <p>"The name of my story is, 'Katie's Flower Garden.'"</p>
                  <p>Katie blushed and smiled with gratified delight, and pressed closer to Annie
                     Laurie.</p>
                  <p>There was a slight murmur of satisfaction among the children. They all leaned
                     forward to hear better. Annie began:</p>
                  <p>"This story is not intended for young ladies and gentlemen, say of fourteen or
                     fifteen years of age, who are, of course, in the first class at school—have
                     gone all through Mangnall's questions, Pike's arithmetic, Comstock's
                     philosophy, to say nothing of astronomy, physical geography, logic, rhetoric,
                     and Kaimes criticism. To such learned young people I wouldn't pretend to tell
                     such a story; but I mean it for quite little girls and boys, no older nor wiser
                     than darling little Katie, who was only six years old, and liked better to play
                     in her flower garden than to study the multiplication table, though she had a
                     beautiful card to learn it from, all printed in gilded figures, with a
                     brilliant red and green border to it. Katie's flower garden was a small spot of
                     ground in the corner of her father's large grounds. Katie loved it very much
                     and spent most of her play-time there. It was very nicely laid out in little
                     beds, round and square, shapes of triangles and hearts mixed in with them; and
                     right in the centre was a small arbor, all over-run with yellow and white
                     jasmine, and great bunches of multiflora roses. There was on the outside of
                     Katie's garden a large tank, cemented and filled with water; in it grew
                     water-lilies, white callas, and lemon-colored monoka nuts. But this tank
                     belonged to the great garden, not to Katie's. It was almost as good, though,
                     for Katie, because she could sit in her arbor and throw crumbs to the gold-fish
                     that lived in the tank, and laugh to see them dart to the surface and seize the
                     crumbs with their wide mouths, while all their burnished scales would glitter
                     and shine as they rushed through the clear water. Then she would see them sink
                     down, down, and hide again under the great broad, green leaves of the lilies,
                     or sail slowly along, moving their fins in a very indolent manner, idly waiting
                     for flies or earth worms, which sometimes fell with a sudden flop into the calm
                     water. Katie had a variety of flowers in her garden: there were roses—</p>
                  <p>("Oh, yes! sweet cabbage roses," suggested the real Katie, at Annie's
                     knee.)</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sweet cabbage roses," continued Annie, "and tall white lilies, and
                     pinks"—</p>
                  <p>("And hyacinths," interpolated Margaret.)</p>
                  <p>"And blue-bells," "and heliotrope," "and rhodendrons," "and heart's-ease, and
                     mignionnette," "and jilly flowers, and periwinkles, and phloxes, and, oh!
                     California jasmine"—screamed all the children in concert around Annie
                     Laurie—each remembering a favorite flower.</p>
                  <p>Lucian laughed at the enthusiastic eagerness of the children as he sat in the
                     corner on the sofa. Miss Smith ceased her crocheting for an instant. The
                     professor took his pipe from his mouth, looked at Annie and her excited
                     audience, and said, "Umph!"—then he put his pipe back again.</p>
                  <p>Annie smiled.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, there were all those flowers in Katie's garden. The old gardener who took
                     care of it, as well as of her father's, used to show Katie how to tend her
                     plants, and would often tell her about each one; where it grew first and how it
                     grew, and what it liked, because flowers are different in their habits; some
                     like one thing and some another; some are very thirsty, like water-lilies, and
                     some like to be warm and dry, like cacti. This was a very wise old man, almost
                     as learned as Professor Liebermann," said Annie, with playful malice.</p>
                  <p>The children all turned in a body to look with curiosity at the professor, as
                     he sat smoking outside the window—being shy, it made him blush to be so stared
                     at. He shook his pipe menacingly at Annie, and at Miss Smith, who was laughing
                     at him.</p>
                  <p>Annie went on with her story.</p>
                  <p>"Katie had a pet parrot—"</p>
                  <p>"Like Jacko," exclaimed the children.</p>
                  <p>"Jacko is a Mackaw," said Annie; "this was a little green parrot, with yellow
                     in his wings and on his breast; he followed Katie wherever he could go. One
                     warm, midsummer afternoon, Katie had been working in her garden—wearied and
                     overcome by the heat, she lay down on the broad bench inside, to rest. She lay
                     there a long time; she always said she was not asleep—'only
                        <emph>thinking.'</emph> But a little wren finding her so still, hopped
                     inside the arbor, and seeing she did not move, ventured to come nearer—put his
                     head first on one side, then on the other; looked at the beautiful child lying
                     with one arm under her curly head, her cheeks all flushed, the long, black
                     eyelashes lying so quiet, over them; her breath coming and going so regularly
                     and sweetly, and he nodded his head, and went to work picking up the crumbs of
                     cake Katie had dropped from her other open hand, which lay all limp and
                        widely<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6308-00000044"/> stretched, every pink finger
                     unclosed on the broad bench by her side.</p>
                  <p>"'Ah! ha!' the little wren twittered; "Katie's asleep, Katie's asleep.'</p>
                  <p>"The flowers in her garden all leaned forward to see her!</p>
                  <p>"You know all flowers have tiny bits of sparks of souls—that makes them live,
                     and gives them all the beauty and form they have, and these are called 'Fay
                     souls.' Every flower has its own Fay soul. Mr. Swedenborg says, 'that certain
                     atmospheres in the innermost heavens, appear as if sparkling with
                     infinitesimals,' (that means, the least, least, tiny) 'infantine, or baby
                     forms, and these are the real souls of the flowers, on this earth.' Professor
                     Liebermann can tell you all about it," said Annie, glancing mischievously at
                     the professor. The professor groaned an indignant rejection of the whole New
                     Church theology.</p>
                  <p>Annie went on with her story:</p>
                  <p>"Of course, flowers talk when nobody can hear them; they loved Katie, she was
                     so good to them. Katie's parrot, who was really asleep, standing on one leg,
                     with his head under his wing, near her, on a branch of the multiflora rose,
                     opened one eye, when he heard what the wren said, and croaking out, 'I'll keep
                     watch for Katie,' he climbed up to the very top of the arbor, gave himself a
                     good shake, and opened both eyes, watching all about him. Then the flowers
                     began to talk. A mocking-bird, balancing himself on a willow spray near by,
                     overheard some words, and, being a bird full of curiosity, he flew over to
                     listen to the conversation. Lighting on the top of the arbor, near the parrot,
                     he very politely saluted the parrot, with an imitation of his own croak; then
                     pushing aside a flower, he peeped in at Katie. Seeing a great, ugly spider
                     letting itself down by a long thread, right into Katie's face, the mocking-bird
                     made a dart at him and gobbled him up; then turning around, he gave a little
                     chirp:</p>
                  <p>"Now, every body, keep quiet while I sing a serenade for Katie.'</p>
                  <p>"He had just begun to sing when a blue jay came screeching into the garden:</p>
                  <p>"'What's the matter here? What's the matter here?'</p>
                  <p>"The mocking-bird flew at him, and the parrot screamed at him:</p>
                  <p>"'Go away—go away!'</p>
                  <p>"The blue jay flew off as fast as he could, shrieking as the valorous
                     mocking-bird pursued him. The flowers watched the two as the mocking-bird drove
                     the jay-bird away—away—out of the garden—over the fields, until they were both
                     lost to sight. In a few moments, however, the mocking-bird came back, flying
                     from tree-top to tree-top, stopping on every tree to sing a verse of his
                     war-song of triumph. At last, he perched on the arbor, and finished it. The
                     flowers listened, though they considered it rather self-glorifying on the part
                     of the mocking-bird to sing so—about his own triumph over the jay-bird; but
                     then they excused it, remembering how long the mocking-bird had lived alone
                     among Indians, and of course, he had acquired their habits—being, at best, but
                     half civilized. So the mocking-bird danced his war-dance on the jasmine bough,
                     and imitated all the birds of the forest, in a most lively manner, running
                     through the whole gamut of bird-music—getting so excited at last that he threw
                     himself up, off the jasmine bough, turned a summersault in the air, screamed
                     like the victimized blue-jay, then perched again on his branch, nearly out of
                     breath. The parrot cried:</p>
                  <p>"'Bravo! Bravo!' and tried to remember some French words he knew once—'chautez
                     tonjours, mes amours,' but he couldn't; so he gave an embarrassed croak, a
                     confused laugh, and subsided into silence.</p>
                  <p>"'Oh! what eloquence!' exclaimed the johnny-jump-ups, lifting their heads out
                     of the grass; 'what beautiful singing!'</p>
                  <p>"'Bah!' said the laurel; 'talking of eloquence, you should have lived at
                     Athens, where I used to hear Demosthenes speak, you would not call
                        "<emph>that</emph> eloquence."'</p>
                  <p>"'Ah!' sighed the hyacinth, tolling all her bells, one after another; 'Don't
                     recall that dear native land. I was named, you know, from a beautiful youth,
                     beloved by Apollo, and slain by Zephyrus, with a quoit. My festivals were so
                     splendid—you should have heard the maidens sing about me in Greek.'</p>
                  <p>"'What's all this pagan talk?' said the rose; 'don't you know this is a
                     Christian court? I won't have my subjects talk like heathen.'</p>

                  <p>"'Who speaks of India?' The flowers started at the sound of these words, they
                     were uttered in such a coarse, husky voice. It was the monoka nut, speaking
                     from the tank. He slowly lifted up his great, heavy chalice, and shook the
                     drops of water from it. 'I am an Indian fakir! I am the sacred Indian bean! I
                     came here across the Behrings Straits when my people came over—my people are
                     gone, gone—the red man has porished—has perished; Bhudda never aided them—their
                     mounds are all over the land. I am under a vow—a vow of silence and mourning—I
                     mourn for my perished people. I am an Indian fakir!'</p>
                  <p>"His head sunk down on his broad green leaf, and he was silent, as he floated
                     on the bosom of the water.</p>
                  <p>"'You have not suffered more than I,' plaintively sighed the heliotrope: 'I
                     came from Peru; my Incas were all killed, and my people oppressed by the
                     Spaniards, and the golden garden of the Princess Lili all destroyed."</p>
                  <p>"'I am a Republican," said the phlox, 'I came from New Jersey.'</p>
                  <p>"'A Yankee, a Yankee, turn him out!' screamed all the flowers in concert.</p>
                  <p>"'Hush, hush!' said the fragrant olive. 'We are all brothers—I am a Chinese;
                     governments are many, reason is one—we are all brothers.'"</p>
                  <p>At this point of the story Professor Liebermann knocked the ashes out of his
                     pipe on the window sill, in a rather vehement mood. Annie Laurie glanced at him
                     merrily.</p>
                  <p>"Thron des Himmels," said the professor. "Welcher Geschwats!"</p>
                  <p>The professor, holding the development theory, believed the negro to be only a
                     developed Chimpanzee, therefore was violently anti-abolition, and State's
                     rights in his politics. Annie laughed and went on with her story.</p>
                  <p>"Just here the turtle-doves in the woods began to sing, 'Come out in the woods,
                     come out in the woods!' The mocking-bird listened a moment, then, very rudely
                     taking the song out of their beaks, he sang it himself, better than they could,
                     softening the last note into a prolonged trill, with a real operatic touch, a
                     dying fall that fainted away until it was inaudible.</p>
                  <p>"'I call that singing!' exclaimed a bright-eyed toad, hopping near the
                     tank.</p>
                  <p>"'What do you know of music?' demanded his cousins the frogs, who not being
                     handsome, nor having such beautiful eyes as the toad, piqued themselves on
                     their fine voices, and gave musical soirees every evening.</p>
                  <p>"But the mocking-bird heard their conversation, low as it was, and whirling
                     himself round, he began spitefully to mock <emph>them;</emph> he screeched and
                     he whistled, hummed like a tree-frog, then croaked like a water-frog. The
                     flowers laughed, and all the frogs swelled with indignation. The parrot
                     screamed with admiration, 'Brava! bravo! viva! eviva!' The sun was sinking now,
                     and the dew began to fall. The rose said:</p>
                  <p>"'Be quiet, now; it is the hour for earth's thanksgiving!'</p>
                  <p>"The flowers bent their heads reverently. All the earth was silent. The parrot
                     dropped a jasmine flower, he had bitten off for the purpose, saying, 'Now it is
                     time to waken Katie,' right on Katie's upturned face. Katie sprang up, rubbing
                     her eyes.</p>
                  <p>"'I was not asleep, I was only <emph>thinking;</emph> I heard every word you
                     flowers said.'</p>
                  <p>"The grasshoppers began to sing on the trees near by, the blue-jay came flying
                     back, and screamed over the fence, 'Katie fell asleep in the arbor.'</p>
                  <p>"'Katie didn't,' said one grasshopper, 'Katy did, Katy did!' cried another.
                     Then they all took up the song. Katie ran into her father's house, and left
                     them quarrelling."</p>
                  <p>Little Katie B—— sprang up, and throwing her arms around Annie's neck, kissed
                     her warmly.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! that's a beautiful, beautiful story. I think Katie was asleep,
                     though."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, of course, she was dreaming," said one of the larger girls,
                     contemptuously.</p>
                  <p>Annie laughed, and escaped from their caresses and thanks, saying to the
                     children: "About that you must ask the grasshoppers."<ref rend="super"

                  <p>REGINALD came home. That was a great event in the life of the Lauries; but he
                     stayed very little at Natchez; he was on the plantations in Louisiana or in New
                     Orleans most of the time. Annie found Redgie greatly changed. He was very quiet
                     and grave, subdued and indifferent in manner. She was not altogether satisfied
                     with Redgie; but he talked very little of his career abroad. He absorbed
                     himself in the planting and in his profession; would come occasionally to visit
                     his family, but never remained long. His English friends joined him, and they
                     spent the winter in hunting, shooting, and fishing expeditions. Redgie<pb
                        n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6308-00000045"/> brought them to Natchez, and took them
                     to Pass Christian in the summer to fish. They stayed nearly a year with
                     Reginald, enjoying themselves greatly. They were delighted with Reginald's
                     family. Annie they pronounced to be "<emph>perfect,</emph>" and Margaret was
                     promising to be a beauty some day.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie, the second year of Lucian's stay in his family, instigated by
                     Margaret, had proposed to send him to college, if he would consent to go. Mr.
                     Laurie had become very fond of the young man. Lucian thought the matter over,
                     and concluded it was best for him to go. Since he had lived with the Lauries he
                     had grown painfully sensible of his own ignorance, and was desirous to study
                     and qualify himself thoroughly for the position his birth and rank entitled him
                     to take in the world. He decided, therefore, to accept this loan from Mr.
                     Laurie and go to college. Annie superintended the preparations for his
                     departure with as much interest as if he had been her brother. Margaret and
                     Jenny hemmed cravats till their fingers were sore, and marked all his
                     pocket-handkerchiefs in elaborate sampler-letters. The stately Miss Smith
                     knitted him a silk purse, and Mr. Laurie filled it with gold pieces, and gave
                     the youth a solemn blessing, with both hands on his head, the morning he went
                     away. Margaret cried herself sick. Lucian felt that he was indeed going "from
                     home," as they all phrased it to him. But he went, and the family settled down
                     into its usual quiet routine of living.</p>
                  <p>Not long after Harold Ashton challenged Edward Morris, and they fought a duel.
                     Harold wrote Annie that he had been forced at last to take notice of Morris's
                     premed-itatedly insulting behavior, though he assured her he had striven for
                     her sake to avoid it; but Morris forced it on him.</p>
                  <p>Morris escaped unharmed. Harold was badly wounded in the arm. People said that
                     Morris had fired out of time—before the word was given. He declared it was
                     accidental, but men shook their heads about it. Harold certainly was wounded in
                     his right arm <emph>before</emph> the word was given, and had fired with his
                     left, grazing Morris's coat. Everybody knew Harold Ashton was a prime shot. Men
                     not only whispered about it but they spoke openly. Edward Morris was "cut" by
                     several of his former acquaintances. As soon as Harold could he wrote to Annie.
                     She wept a great many useless tears over all this. Reginald was very cool to
                     Edward Morris.</p>
                  <p>As amiable and excellent as Mr. Laurie always appeared, his prejudices were
                     very strong—his antipathies stubborn when once awakened. He held almost Victor
                     Hugoish opinions about capital punishment, war, or duels. He was a perfect
                     Brahmin where life was concerned—a Gymnosophist. These opinions of his were
                     well known to is family and friends; so Annie dreaded the fact of this duel
                     between Morris and Ashton should ever become known to her father. Mr. Laurie
                     heard it, however, in general conversation from some morning visitors Annie had
                     received in his presence. He expressed his anger and indignation very openly
                     towards both of the young men. Annie tried in vain to give a favorable turn to
                     Harold's part in the affair. Her father would listen to no excuse, no
                     amelioration of the offence. Harold came to see Annie as soon as he could bear
                     his arm in a sling. Mr. Laurie received him very coldly. Harold's pride and
                     keen susceptibility took exception instantly. Sensitive, jealous, and
                     irritable, he, too, became unreasonable, and was as frigid and haughty in
                     demeanor as Mr. Laurie. This was intense pain for Annie, who tried in vain to
                     soothe Harold and bring back harmony between the two so dear to her. But Harold
                     thought he was right in every respect, felt wronged by Mr. Laurie, was
                     unyielding and obstinate. He went away in a bad temper.</p>
                  <p>Edward Morris prefaced <emph>his</emph> return by a long letter to Mr. Laurie,
                     in which he sweetly, and gracefully acknowledged his error and entreated to be
                     restored to Mr. Laurie's esteem and friendship. In making his explanation he
                     managed cleverly, without absolute false statements, to throw the blame of the
                     difficulty upon Harold. Then he came to see Mr. Laurie. At first the old man
                     was stiff, but Edward succeeded in a very little while in softening the
                     acerbity and very soon was as easy, as charming, and unrestrained in manner as
                     if he had never heard of Harold Ashton, nor ever committed the heinous crime of
                     "fighting a duel." Mr. Laurie invited him to dine, and so all was <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">couleur de rose.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>That evening again Edward Morris was flatly rejected by Annie Laurie.</p>
                  <p>Morris spoke through his shut teeth, as Annie, with perfect frankness, and with
                     scarcely the usual forms of courtesy, told him he was nothing to her, nor ever
                     could be.</p>
                  <p>"It would not be so if 'it was not for that beggar Ashton."</p>
                  <p>Annie sprang to her feet. For an instant her eyes flashed almost like those of
                     Louise Branger. She swept past Morris to go out of the door.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Morris, you forget yourself. Your horse is at the rack, sir. In future,
                     your visits will be made to my father alone. I shall never receive you!"</p>
                  <p>Edward seized her hand as she passed him, and nearly crushed it in his angry
                     grasp.</p>
                  <p>"You <emph>shall</emph> hear me! I love you, and I <emph>will</emph> speak. It
                     is <emph>he</emph> that comes between us, and you know it."</p>
                  <p>Annie tried to withdraw her hand, but Edward held it fast. She would not
                     contend, but drawing herself to her full height, she looked at Morris with
                     blazing eyes, and said slowly and deliberately—</p>
                  <p>"You are right. I love him better than my own life—better than my own soul—God
                     forgive me!"</p>
                  <p>With a muttered curse Morris flung her hand away from him, and rushed out of
                     the room.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments Annie saw him riding rapidly out of the gateway. If he had met
                     Harold Ashton, he would have shot him down without warning. He hated him so.
                     But fortunately he did not meet him.</p>
                  <p>Ten minutes after, Harold stood by Annie in the garden—moody, angry, jealous—he
                     had learned that Morris had been invited to dine, by Mr. Laurie. He came to say
                     good bye. He was about to return to New Orleans. Annie's tender words—even her
                     fond embrace, could not quite clear his sullen brow.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, if you were mine—only mine! If you love me, come, Annie!"</p>
                  <p>"My father, my kind father!" was all that Annie could say.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot leave him, Harold, but do not distrust me—oh, do not! Heart of my
                     heart—life of my life—soul of my soul! have patience—wait, my Harold!"</p>
                  <p>"It is always 'wait,' Annie. I can give you a home now, although a plain one.
                     Let your father give his money to Reginald and Margaret, but you come to
                     me—now!"</p>
                  <p>Annie covered her face with her hands;—tears streamed through her slender
                     fingers.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Harold, you are so cruel!—you make me wretched."</p>
                  <p>When Harold saw the tears flow he grew repentant and submissive: even promised
                     to make an attempt to mollify Mr. Laurie when he came again on a visit to
                     Natchez, which he said should be soon. He quickly comforted Annie with promises
                     of patience and trust; pressed her to his heart, and left her.</p>
                  <p>The day after, to Annie's extreme surprise, Edward Morris returned to see Mr.
                     Laurie. He invited himself to dine with the family. He had always been
                     intimate, and he chose to avail himself of all the privileges of hospitality.
                     He made himself delightfully agreeable to Mr. Laurie, to Miss Smith, to the
                     professor,—even Margaret succumbed to his fascination.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie was coldly polite and silent. She saw him only in her father's
                     presence, and replied as succinctly as possible whenever he compelled her to
                     speak to him. She would not treat her father's guest rudely, but it was clearly
                     perceptible to all but Mr. Laurie that Annie was as reserved and distant as she
                     could be, consistently with the laws of good breeding.</p>
                  <p>Morris ground his teeth, when he went away. But he came soon again—he came
                     continually; he kept a jealous watch over Annie. He regained all his influence
                     over Mr. Laurie, and the whole household, and he managed by occasional
                     allusions, words carelessly dropped, to create in Mr. Laurie's mind suspicion
                     and prejudice against Harold Ashton. He did not exactly say so, but he conveyed
                     the impression that Harold was wild and dissipated in his living in New
                     Orleans; that he had thrown himself into a set of politicians who were not very
                     reputable, and whose principles Mr. Laurie, a stern Whig, held in perfect
                     abhorrence. He was sustained, in this clandestine sapping of Ashton's good
                     fame, by the frequent mention of Harold's name as a speaker in the papers. At
                     all the meetings, caucasses, etc., Harold was called out. And he did give
                     himself up most too much to this kind of excitement, to the detriment of his
                     law practice; but he was not the demagogue, nor the drunkard, nor the
                     frequenter of the Faro table, that Edward Morris persisted in representing him
                     to be!</p>
                  <p>When Reginald came, Annie told him frankly how she was situated in regard to
                     Harold. Redgie promised to speak to his father, and he seized the earliest
                     opportunity to do so. Mr. Laurie was greatly distressed; he even wept to learn
                     his daughter's attachment to such an uncertain, unreliable person, as he had
                     gradually grown to believe Harold Ashton to be. He entreated Annie to wait at
                     least a year or so, before she pledged herself absolutely to Harold.</p>
                  <p>Annie listened to her father with perfect patience, but with fixed resolution.
                     She told her father that nothing would induce her to abandon <emph>him.</emph>
                     She would not marry Harold without his free consent, for she could not separate
                     herself from either. But she loved Harold: she could not give <emph>him</emph>
                     up; she could not refuse to see him, nor to correspond with him, and if she did
                     not marry him—she would be no man's wife!</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie was very unhappy. But Annie was immovable, and so matters went.
                     Harold came rarely to see Annie, and saw <emph>her</emph> alone. No longer was
                     he a cherished guest in the family. Margaret and Lucian openly espoused his
                     cause. Margaret would scarcely speak civilly to Edward Morris. Miss Smith
                     silently sympathized with Annie. The professor was divided between his
                     admiration for the charming Morris, and pity for Ashton.</p>
                  <p>Edward did not have "a good time" with the family. Annie's eyes ignored
                     him.—She looked over and beyond him, never at him, unless she was forced to do
                     so. Annie read every day to her father, and wrote at night to Harold beautiful,
                     long letters, telling him how much she loved him, in all the languages she and
                     he knew.</p>
                  <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6308-00000046"/>
                  <p>And so time fied. Lucian away at college—the Lauries spent the winters in
                     Natchez—the summers at the Pass, as usual.</p>
                  <p>Margaret was growing up a tall queen lily, becoming not only graceful, but
                     womanly and dignified, with a dash of Miss Smith's majesty in her deportment.
                     She wore her hair tucked up now, and her dresses were so long you could
                     scarcely see the tips of her slippers. At sixteen, she was a whole head taller
                     than Annie Laurie, and had much <emph>more manner.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Marie exclaimed over her, with admiration this year, when the family moved down
                     for the summer—</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Mile. Margueritte, what splendid young lady you are growed to be! Ah, what
                     mischief you was once!"</p>
                  <p>Little "Jean Lucian Courtenay" was guite a fine little "garçon," and he had a
                     baby sister. Margaret walked, (if you could call it <emph>walking;</emph> such
                     quiet, steady, majestical sweeping along of the longest kind of trained
                     dresses, as she managed to accomplish,) with perfect decorum and propriety to
                     Marie's cottage now. And Jenny imitated her "Misses'" reserved style, as she
                     marched behind her in the usual daily perambulations. No more kittenish tricks,
                     or going after sea-weed or shells. "<emph>Miss Guion</emph>" sometimes took a
                     book and sat under the oak, in the old trysting place,—would lean her head on
                     her hand, and look out on the sea, by the half-hour; but as she was not
                     communicative to Jenny of her thoughts, nobody knew whether she was composing a
                     poem or thinking of one who had sat there with her in days of lang syne. She
                     belonged to the Minna style of women, was inclined to be penseroso, and had
                     written several poems, which she kept hid in the depths of her Cabinet of
                     Treasures.</p>
                  <p>Lucian corresponded with all the family except Margaret. To her he had always
                     sent some affectionate message, evidently thinking of her as "the dear little
                     Margaret" of former days,—a fact of ignorance, and a sample of want of tact on
                     his part, which "Miss Guion" began recently to resent somewhat. Young men began
                     to frequent Mr. Laurie's, and to bring bouquets; serenades were frequent under
                     Margaret's windows these bright summer nights. Mr. Laurie declared
                        <emph>he</emph> grew very weary of hearing youthful voices bidding Margaret
                     to "sleep," and dream of different individuals of her acquaintance. He sat down
                     one morning and made a calculation of the number of times he had heard this
                     sententious piece of advice given to his grand-daughter during one week, and
                     gravely presented the paper to her at the breakfast table. Annie laughed, and
                     Margaret bit her rose-red lips, half in vexation, and half smiling—</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, grandpa, I can't help it, if men <emph>will</emph> be so foolish!"</p>
                  <p>"I did not say you could, my dear," said the old man, smiling: "from what I
                     hear, my darling, yours must be a very fair, young face! It is a deprivation
                     for me, my pet, not to be able to look on it,—I envy those who can!"</p>
                  <p>He spoke these last words with a sigh. It was rare for him to allude to his
                     affliction.</p>
                  <p>In a moment Margaret's arms were around his neck, while bright tears rained
                     from her eyes on his blind face, as she covered it with kisses. "Oh! grandpa,
                     grandpa!" was all she could say.</p>
                  <p>In spite of the external snow, there was fire and impulse still in this jung
                     frau. There was no doubt about it, Margaret Guion was a beauty of the first
                     order, and—she knew it! She was not spoiled so much, either, though she did
                     flirt a little in a very stately way.</p>

                  <p>IN 1861, the war cloud was ready to burst.</p>
                  <p>Mars, Neptune, Vulcan and Apollo, had "their chariots yoked." Minerva, the
                     goddess of wisdom, stood aloof. She had nothing to do with this contest. But
                     the Southern Diana was weary of having her ears boxed continually with her own
                     quiver, by the white armed Northern Juno; so they prepared for battle. Then
                     justice fled to heaven. It is the most comfortable place for her to be during
                     the changes of Time! Eternity rights all things! Nations may go down in a
                     whirlpool of strife, but truth and right must prevail at last! One can always
                     bide God's time!</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie sat in her father's library, at Natchez, reading the newspapers to
                     him. Everybody read the newspapers with eager interest at this period. Annie
                     exclaimed in surprise over a paragraph she came to—</p>
                  <p>"Listen, papa! Do hear this. Is it not surprising?"</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>"SINGULAR DISCOVERY.—H. B. M. ship Britannia, driven by a storm into one of
                        the harbors of an unfrequented Island of the Marquesas, on the 18th August
                        last, to get water and make repairs, reports that—the men sent for water,
                        returned with the information that the island was inhabited; that the
                        natives had received them in a friendly manner, without surprise, as is
                        usually the case upon the first seeing of white men. They showed them the
                        springs of water, and also conducted them, after they had filled their
                        casks, into a pleasant grove of palms, where the village was located cated.
                        Taking them into a neatly thatched hut, they presented them to a very old
                        white man, for whom they seemed to have a special veneration. The old man
                        was very sick, and evidently near his death hour—but he recognized the
                        sailors, and held out his trembling hands to greet them. He spoke English;
                        he told them that his name was Philip Noland; that he had been guilty of
                        mutiny, and sentenced to death; but preferring exile, he had, means of
                        bribery, escaped from the vessel which was taking him to America, to this
                        island. He had been living there fifty years—the man was about seventy-five
                        years of age, good looking, with a venerable long white beard. He said he
                        had tried often to escape from the island when he would see ships pass at a
                        distance, but had never succeeded in reaching a vessel. He had lived here
                        and taught the islanders all he could. He said he had been married in
                        Natchez, Mississippi,—begged to have his discovery and death published, so
                        it might reach the ears of those who might still be living, who had known
                        him there. The Captain of the Britannia visited him, on the return of the
                        sailors with this report to the vessel. The old man gave him a miniature of
                        his wife, and some other trifles, to send to America. The old man was very
                        weak and exhausted, and could not talk much. He died before the vessel
                        sailed. The Captain had him buried on the island, the Chaplain of the vessel
                        reading the burial service. The old man had a prayer-book of the Church of
                        England, which he had evidently preserved with care. The miniature and other
                        articles have been forwarded to Washington city, to be delivered to the
                        Secretary of the Navy, whence the friends of Philip Noland can claim
                        them."</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>"You must write on immediately for them, Annie!" said Mr. Laurie. "It must be
                     Jane's husband!"</p>
                  <p>Annie wrote and sent the letter off that morning.</p>
                  <p>Three weeks after, the package arrived from Washington city. Annie opened it in
                     the library.</p>
                  <p>Yes! there was the miniature of Jane Noland, in her youthful
                     beauty—unmistakable; and the prayer-book, with the inscription "Philip Noland,
                     from Jane Vail." Then the date of their marriage, 1806, lower down on the same
                     page.</p>
                  <p>Annie was still holding the miniature in her hand, speaking of it to her
                     father, when old Patty," the nurse of poor Jane Noland, entered the room
                     hurriedly.</p>
                  <p>"Miss Annie, I wish you would jest come and look at Miss Jane. She looks mighty
                     strange this mornin'; you know she was complainin' yesterday, when you sent for
                     the doctor for her, and I gived her all the powders as he left for her to take;
                     she sleeped mighty well and quiet through the night, but she do look at me so
                     queer! Jest now she 'peared more sensible like than I ever saw her; she lay
                     there alookin' at me for a long time, then she said, quiet and soft like: 'Who
                     are you, good woman? what is your name? Why ain't Lola here?' She used to call
                        <emph>me</emph> 'Lola' always. I says, 'suadin' her: <emph>'I am</emph>
                     Lola, Miss Jane.' She smiled, Miss Annie, jest as natural as you would, and put
                     her hands up to her poor head. 'No, you are very kind to me, but you ain't
                     Lola.' Miss Annie, it made me feel hurted to hear the poor thing speak that
                     way, and I began to cry. She said: 'Don't cry, but I would like to have Lola,
                     if you please. Do call my sister Lucy.' Now then, Miss Annie, you better come
                     and see her, for I dun know what to say to her, no how."</p>
                  <p>Annie rose instantly from her chair, and followed Patty to her grand-aunt's
                     apartment. Jane was lying quietly, with her eyes closed, but she opened them
                     instanta-neously, as Annie approached the bed side, and fixed a long,
                     inquisitive gaze upon her niece. Annie recognized the light of intellect
                     returned to the dark, sunken eyes. She trembled in every limb, and could with
                     difficulty restrain her tears; she took the withered, feeble hand gently in
                     both of hers, and bending over the poor creature, kissed her tenderly on the
                     wrinkled forehead. Jane looked up at the soft eyes swimming with tears, bent on
                     her so kindly, and she smiled pleasantly.</p>
                  <p>"My dear," she said, in a low voice, "you are very pretty and kind; what is
                     your name? Can't you call Lucia and Lola to me? I would like to see them, if
                     you please. I know Philip is away at sea, or he would come too."</p>
                  <p>"Aunt Jane," said Annie, soothingly, your sister is gone away for a while, and
                     Lola is with her. But you will soon be with them. I am your niece; you never
                     saw me before; but your sister Lucia left me here to take care of you; you will
                     let me do it, won't you, till you see your sister?"</p>
                  <p>Annie tried to smile, though tears glittered on her long eye-lashes, she felt
                     hysterical, and her voice was choked.</p>
                  <p>The poor old woman returned the smile with a brighter one, and patted Annie's
                     little hand gently with her feeble fingers.</p>
                  <p>"I think I have seen you before," she said, doubtingly, evidently struggling
                     between past and present recollections. "I like you very much, though indeed I
                     would like to see Lucia and Lola. But they'll be back soon, I suppose—but," she
                     continued, looking around restlessly, "<emph>this</emph> is not my room—you
                     might let me go to my own room, I think,"—rather impatiently now—"I
                        <emph>will</emph> go, I don't like this room—let me<pb n="92-93"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000047"/> go," struggling to rise. "It is all nonsense
                     about Lucia Vail; I am not afraid, I <emph>will</emph> have that room. Lucia is
                     silly!"</p>
                  <p>"You shall go, dear Aunt Jane, only wait till I have a fire made in it. You see
                     it has been raining and it makes everything so damp."</p>
                  <p>Annie ordered Patty, in a low voice, to have the haunted chamber prepared
                     instantly for use. She sat down by the patient's bedside, to watch her till it
                     was ready.</p>
                  <p>Jane lay with her eyes closed, apparently content and tranquil, after hearing
                     the order given to make a fire in her ancient apartment.</p>
                  <p>Annie held her hand; the poor creature clasped her fingers weakly round the
                     youthful, warm hand which grasped her's tenderly.</p>
                  <p>"What is your name?" she demanded, abruptly, her eyes wandering over Annie's
                     face and figure.</p>
                  <p>"Annie Laurie."</p>
                  <p>"Pretty name! You look like Lucia. I think it is strange of <emph>her</emph> to
                     go away and take Lola; I would like to see Philip <emph>very, very</emph>
                     much!" emphasizing her words piteously.</p>
                  <p>"Wouldn't you like to have his miniature to look at, Aunt Jane? and his
                     prayer-book he sent to you, back from the sea?" asked Annie in a tremulous
                     voice.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes!" and the light of joy blazed up in her sunken eyes—"Oh, yes! will you
                     give them to me?"</p>
                  <p>"I will go get them for you now, Aunt Jane."</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie rose, and calling to Jenny, who happened to be passing, to come
                     and sit by her aunt's bed, she went into her own apartment to seek the
                     prayer-book. The miniature she got off the parlor wall. Wiping the tears of
                     sympathy hastily from her eyes, she hurried with the picture and the book to
                     the loving, dying widow.</p>
                  <p>Jenny was sitting off at a respectful distance, near to the door, very much
                     awed, staring at the half-slumbering form on the bed, in unfeigned terror.
                     Annie went up to the bed and touched the hands folded so quietly together.</p>
                  <p>"Here they are, dear Aunt Jane!"</p>
                  <p>The poor woman seized them eagerly. She gazed at the miniature with a burst of
                     tender feeling, that irradiated her aged features. She kissed the picture
                     fondly.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, this is he, my Philip! my husband! my handsome Philip! I shall be so glad
                     when he <emph>does</emph> come; and you say he sent me this?" taking up the
                     worn prayerbook and pressing it to her lips.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he sent it to you, this year, by an English ship."</p>
                  <p>"I gave it to him," she said; "I suppose he knew I would like to use his
                     prayer-book while he was gone; I hope he got another for himself! Now take me
                     into my own room, my dear, and then you must read me some of the prayers and
                     some psalms, as Lucia is not here to do it. Somehow my eyes trouble me; I can't
                     see so very well. Have I been very sick? I am so weak and so thin; don't you
                     see?"—lifting up her feeble hand, as she spoke. It shook with debility; Annie
                     clasped it tenderly, and steadied it with her strong young nerves.</p>
                  <p>"You have been very sick, and for a long time, dear Aunt Jane."</p>
                  <p>"I suppose I have been; I don't remember; my head feels so queer!"</p>
                  <p>Patty came with the information that "the room" was now ready. Calling some
                     servants, Annie made them lift the couch, upon which poor Jane was lying,
                     carefully into this apartment; then she, with the assistance of Patty and
                     Betsy, got her comfortably in the bed. "Her own bed!"</p>
                  <p>Jane lay leaning her withered check against the hand which held her husband's
                     picture, grasping the prayer-book in the other, as it lay extended upon the
                     bed. Looking about her with satisfaction:</p>
                  <p>"I like my own room," she said; "and I should like to have some roses in my
                     vases," observing the empty flower-stands on the toilet; "that was careless in
                     Lola. I wonder she did not put some in: she knows I always like to have them;
                     but I forgot"—</p>
                  <p>Checking herself with a child-like laugh.</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>keep</emph> forgetting. You say she has gone away with Lucia; of
                     course, she couldn't fill my vases."</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie whispered to Patty. Patty went out; she soon returned with a
                     basket of flowers. Annie made Patty bring the vases and flowers to her, as she
                     sat by the bedside. The poor sufferer was much pleased; she handled lovingly
                     the roses, and inhaled with delight the fragrance of some hyacinths which Annie
                     held towards her. She watched every movement of Annie's graceful fingers,
                     working with the flowers as she arranged the roses, and handed them, one by
                     one, to Patty to place on the toilet.</p>
                  <p>"There, Aunt Jane; Lola, I am sure, couldn't have done it better."</p>
                  <p>Annie's smiles were very tearful; but she forced the smiles to come.</p>
                  <p>"No, she couldn't," replied Jane. I like that—the roses are so very pretty.
                     Philip likes roses."</p>
                  <p>Patty went on now, by Annie's command, to arrange the whole toilet apparatus so
                     long unused. She filled the perfume boxes with fragrant essences, put the combs
                     and brushes in their appointed places, and added all the delicate refinements
                     that ladies like about their toilets, bringing all the materials out of Annie's
                     room, from her own dressing-table. Poor Jane watched her, and sighed with
                     satisfaction when all this was done.</p>
                  <p>"That is a nice pin-cushion," she said; "put my powder puff in that square
                     silver box. That's right."</p>
                  <p>"Now my dear—you say you are my niece, though I don't know you. Sprinkle some
                     eau de cologne on my handkerchief out of that bottle—that <emph>silver</emph>
                     bottle, that she has just filled. My mother gave me that bottle. Put the
                     handkerchief over my face—my <emph>eyes do feel</emph> so queer—and read to me
                     out of my husband's prayer-book."</p>
                  <p>Annie obeyed her; she covered up the poor, aching eyes with her own fine
                     handkerchief, steeped in cologne, out of the favorite bottle, and then sitting
                     down by the bed, she read the divine, the ever consolatory words of the sweet
                     singer of Israel. She read on, and on. Sometimes Jane would repeat a line or
                     verse that seemed to please her.</p>
                  <p>The night stole over the earth as Annie was reading:</p>
                  <p>"Now read me prayers, my dear—the prayer for those at sea."</p>
                  <p>Annie read that, and other prayers, kneeling down by the bed-side. Old Patty
                     knelt down in a corner, with her head bowed down on her arms. Annie's voice
                     ceased; she saw poor Jane was sleeping now.</p>
                  <p>Annie went out, gave her father his tea, then returned to watch for the night
                     by her aunt.</p>
                  <p>Betsy came in on tiptoe, about ten o'clock, and sat silently with Patty, near
                     the fire—sat still and silent, hour after hour—a solemn watch they knew they
                     were keeping by the bed of the dying woman. The two negro women soon nodded in
                     sleep, their heads bent over the arms of their easy chairs.</p>
                  <p>Annie sat motionless, her eyes fixed on the calmly-sleeping woman on the bed.
                     The clock in the hall struck clearly—eleven, twelve. The negro women and Jane
                     Noland slept on. An ashen hue was slowly creeping over Jane Noland's sunken
                     face. It made Annie shudder to see it! Death is always terrible to the young.
                     "One" rung out from the clock in the hall. Annie Laurie never could tell
                     whether it was an illusion caused by imagination, whether she had lost herself
                     for an instant in sleep in that silent watch, but she felt a rush of cold air
                     from the back door, at the foot of the bed, leading out into the garden; the
                     candles were suddenly extinguished by the wind; a low, sad song seemed to swell
                     on her ear. Starting up, Annie saw, or thought she saw, near the sleeping,
                     dying woman, the phantom, Lucia Vail, seated on the bed, bending over poor
                     Jane, with her hands clasped and writhing, singing, singing, till, with her
                     usual low cry, she tossed her hands up, over head, and faded away.</p>
                  <p>Annie stood transfixed; cold tremors ran over her; she shook as if with ague.
                     The fire burned high, as the phantom faded away. Poor Jane started up with a
                     cry of joy—throwing her arms out wildly, she cried in a strong voice:</p>
                  <p>"My Philip! Come at last! Oh! thank God! My blessed Saviour!"—</p>
                  <p>The joyful, irradiated countenance changed, the grey head sank back heavily,
                     the sentence remained unfinished, or was finished in Paradise.</p>
                  <p>Annie sprang to her aunt, and lifted the sinking head in her arms—a convulsive
                     movement and all was still—Jane Noland was at rest.</p>
                  <p>The negro women, startled by the cry of the dying woman, roused from their
                     slumbers, hastened to light the candles, and to shut the outer door, which they
                     supposed had been forced open from its insecure fastening, by the wind which
                     was blowing violently, whistling fiercely, and shrieking around the corners of
                     the long galleries in a piercing wail.</p>
                  <p>'Annie quitted the room, after closing the weary eyes that had wept so much and
                     so long. Jane's features were now fast assuming that calm, peaceful beauty
                     which comes on the faces of all the dead who have been good and virtuous in
                     their earthly pilgrimage.</p>
                  <p>Annie was glad to get into her own room, and weep on her pillow. She was worn
                     out, and exhausted from excitement. She wept over the wasted life—as it seemed
                     to her, of poor Jane Noland—she wept over Harold—over her father—over herself.
                     Poor Annie!</p>
                  <p>We, poor mortals, whose hearts burn within us and dissolve so in tenderness and
                     heavenly charity over each other, we can not—<emph>can not</emph> trust our
                     beloveds and ourselves into the hands of the Infinitely loving Almighty Father,
                     who loves us all!</p>
                  <p>So rarely do we pause in our wild, wild weeping—in our loud lamenting—in our
                     struggles in the sea of life, to listen to the soft, calm voice sounding
                     ceaselessly over the tossing billows:</p>

                  <p>EVERY arrangement was made for Lucia Dare's wedding—the day appointed and the
                     few guests invited. Among them cards were sent to the Prince and Princess
                     Roskopff. Lucia had appealed in vain to her father to be spared this marriage,
                     or at least for a reprieve, even if but for a few months longer. She felt like
                     a hunted doe, driven into a corner without hope of escape. Her heart sank
                     within her as she realized that time, long or short, could make no difference,
                     no change in her feelings or position. It was probable, more than probable,
                     that she would never see Reginald Laurie again; and if she did, what difference
                     would it make? She never, never could become <emph>his</emph> wife. In the
                     first place he had never asked in words for her love. She knew perfectly well
                     that he <emph>did</emph> love her, and was only restrained by man's pride from
                     seeking her hand. She was very wretched. Poor little Lucia! That soft Vail
                     temperament was not a good one to go through the world with—they were such
                     Ephraimites, the women of that race—prone to set up idols!</p>
                  <p>Lucia wandered about her pretty garden very disconsolate. Cousin Vail was
                     greatly troubled about her. He saw how very unhappy she was; but could discover
                     no reason for the wretchedness, inarticulate, except for the unwitting
                     testimony given by the pale cheeks and heavy eyes, that looked as if they wept
                     themselves into sleep and oblivion every night.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of M—— was a fine man—an "excellent match," and apparently devoted to
                     Lucia. But she shrunk from him with coldness and trembling, and avoidance she
                     could not conceal. In his proud self-complacency he regarded <emph>that</emph>
                     as only a timid girl's shyness, and was rather attracted by it than
                     otherwise.</p>
                  <p>"She would get over all that," he reasoned; "she was refined and beautiful—a
                     Dare and an heiress. He could not do better than to marry her."</p>
                  <p>Lucia thought sometimes she would appeal to the Earl himself, and beg him to go
                     away and let her rest in quiet and solitude with her wounded soul—but what had
                     she to tell him? That she was almost dying for love of a man who had never even
                     said in so many English words that he reciprocated that affection, and who had
                     gone away to America without a word of regret—whom she never expected to meet
                     again? On one occasion, when she was alone with the Earl of M——, and he
                     attempted some slight lover-like caress, from which she shrunk tremblingly
                     away, he smiled at her evident distress, saying:</p>
                  <p>"My little trembling dove! I don't wan't to frighten you or make you
                     unhappy—believe me, Lucia, I would not distress you for any selfish
                     gratification!"</p>
                  <p>When Lucia heard him speak so kindly and so considerately, the color rose in
                     her cheeks—her eyes brightened—she clasped her hands enthusiastically as she
                     turned to him—her secret quivered on her lips.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my lord, I wish—" She hesitated and broke down—her courage failed.</p>
                  <p>"You wish what, fair lady? You have but to <emph>command</emph> where I am
                     concerned. You know I am only a slave at your feet!" he replied, gaily taking
                     the clasped hands in both his own, and pressing them tenderly.</p>
                  <p>The tears streamed down Lucia's face in a heavy rain of grief.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my lord, this marriage—if it could only be postponed!"</p>
                  <p>He dropped her hands—a cloud swept over his face. He answered coldly and
                     haughtily:</p>
                  <p>"<emph>That</emph> must be according to the decision of your father and
                     yourself, Miss Dare. What consideration can be so grave as to induce you to
                     request a postponement? Will you tell me <emph>why</emph> you desire it?"</p>
                  <p>Lucia was still weeping. She did not know exactly what to answer now. The Earl
                     looked at her as she sat sobbing in open misery. He turned away from her and
                     walked hastily up and down the room several times, with a very troubled
                     countenance. Then coming up to the distressed girl, he said:</p>
                  <p>"Miss Dare, most certainly this emotion is not flattering to any man's pride or
                     affection, in the relation we hold to each other at present. I am not a brute,
                     but an English gentleman; and certainly have no desire to aid in afflicting or
                     oppressing any woman, especially a woman I profess to love, and am seeking to
                     make my wife. Give me a sufficient reason for postponing our marriage, and
                     since you wish it, if possible, it shall be done."</p>
                  <p>"My lord," said Lucia, drying her eyes and speaking with dignity, "I have never
                     been deceitful towards you. You <emph>know</emph> I do not love you. You
                        <emph>know</emph> that it is my father who is giving my hand away—that I
                     have never been consulted in the affair at all. I do not wish to deceive you
                     now. If I marry you, it will be because I am compelled to do so. My heart
                     rebels against being forced into such a tie!"</p>
                  <p>The Earl bit his lip until the blood sprang under the gleaming white teeth. He
                     was angry, and yet he could not show any irritation to the delicate, bending
                     creature who looked up at him with tear-stained eyes, and was trembling like a
                     hunted fawn. In spite of himself he felt sorry for her. She wasn't altogether
                     the style of a woman he liked best after all. The gay, brilliant, dashing Di
                     Howard was much more to his taste than this little pale malmaison rose. But
                     still a man does not like to make a fool of himself or be made a fool of—and
                     she was so pretty, and—ah, well: "It so falls out, that what we have we prize
                     not to its worth, whiles we enjoy it. But being lacked and lost, why then we
                     rack the value. Then we find the virtue that possession would not show us,
                     whiles it was ours!"</p>
                  <p>The Earl thought himself very much more in love with Lucia than he really was
                     when the idea of losing her presented itself for the first time to his
                     imagination. He stood looking at Lucia with a perplexed and doubtful
                     countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, Miss Dare, it is scarcely probable, as I have been engaged so long
                     to you—almost as soon as you were presented after leaving school—but,
                        <emph>have</emph> you any other plans, have you any other suitor?"</p>
                  <p>The blood rushed angrily to his face, and he felt his hands clench
                     involuntarily, as he asked the last question.</p>
                  <p>Lucia replied, in a self-concentred tone, her eyes fixed on the floor,
                     despairingly:</p>
                  <p>"I have no other plans, I have no other suitor!"</p>
                  <p>The Earl drew a long breath of relief. Stepping lightly forward, he took her
                     unresisting hand, and lifted it to his lips, saying gaily:</p>
                  <p>"Then, it is only a little of woman's coyness, or coquetry, sweet Lucia? I will
                     see what can be done to gratify you. I may, perhaps, find it
                        <emph>necessary</emph> to go to the highlands on business of importance. It
                     will be only for snipe-shooting, beautiful Lucia; but if you wish it, I can so
                     present my pressing business affairs to Sir Hugh as to gain for you the
                     reprieve you entreat so pitifully and so artlessly. Three months will not make
                     any difference in my love for you, lady mine; and if it pleases you—well, I
                     think I deserve at least a smile, if nothing more, for my self-abnegation."</p>
                  <p>Bending over he kissed her cheek lightly, and, without any more words, left
                     her, intending to speak to Sir Hugh the next morning, and defer the
                     wedding.</p>
                  <p>After all, it was rather agreeable than otherwise—Di Howard was going to the
                     highlands also; perhaps they might stumble across each other at the houses of
                     mutual friends.</p>
                  <p>He was somewhat puzzled about Lucia.</p>
                  <p>"What a tender, shy, little dove it was!"</p>
                  <p>They had a grand dinner party that day at the Hurst, and the Earl had no
                     opportunity of speaking to Sir Hugh in reference to the wedding.</p>
                  <p>Lucia was much more cheerful than she had been. She had a slight glow in her
                     cheeks, that had so long worn a white livery; she smiled occasionally, and was
                     altogether more charming, the Earl thought, than he had ever seen her. There
                     was a shy gratitude evidenced in her manner towards him, also, that he found
                     very attractive and sweet, though he could not help smiling at the
                     ridiculousness of it.</p>
                  <p>"Confound it," he muttered, sotto voce, "the idea of a man's feeling gratified
                     at such a feeling on the part of his betrothed! She is grateful to me for
                     postponing my own wedding, poor little puss," and he laughed aloud. Then his
                     face clouded, as he began to wonder what it was that made her so bitterly
                     opposed to the marriage, and so much afraid of him. He thought of the starry,
                     flashing eyes of Di Howard, that he had watched grow soft and liquid under his
                     lingering gaze, and he sighed:</p>
                  <p>"It is a pity Di hasn't this girl's fortune, and <emph>her position towards
                        me.</emph> I have no doubt we would all be happier. But what is it an old
                     book says somewhere, 'Fortune has her gifts on her right hand and on her left?'
                     One can't have everything."</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh was unusually gay and hospitable that day; he relaxed his customary<pb
                        n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6308-00000049"/> hauteur in a most remarkable degree,
                     as was afterwards remembered by those who were his guests on this occasion. He
                     drank more freely than usual of wine at dinner. When they were about to retire,
                     a very unusual condescension on his part, Sir Hugh kissed his daughter's
                     forehead as he bade her good night, and patted her cheek with his finger.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the household was startled by the violent ringing of the bell
                     in Sir Hugh's chamber. The frightened servants rushed in a body to their
                     usually irascible master, and met the pallid, stammering Lyndsay at the door,
                     with his hands upraised in real fright.</p>
                  <p>Sir Hugh was dead! Dead, sitting up in his <foreign xml:lang="FRA">robe de
                        chambre</foreign> at a table near the fire-place, his head leaning on his
                     hand, stiffened and cold. Before him were lying a miniature of his wife and one
                     of Gerald, taken as a boy of ten years—nothing more. He seemed to have taken
                     these pictures out of a small drawer that remained still partly open, where
                     Lyndsay said "he kept them habitually." He was looking at them when the
                     messenger of Death found him. Mr. Vail and the Earl were roused; Lucia was told
                     as gently as possible of the terrible occurrence; the whole house and
                     neighborhood was astir.</p>
                  <p>There was much talk and gossip, but little regret felt or expressed, for Sir
                     Hugh was not beloved. The only tears of sorrow which moistened his stately tomb
                     fell from the eyes of his daughter and Mr. Vail. The funeral services were
                     performed with great splendor; Sir Hugh Dare was gathered to his fathers; the
                     world missed him little. By Sir Hugh's will, Mr. Vail was left sole guardian of
                     his daughter, who, in case of the prolonged absence of her brother, was
                     declared heiress of all his estates and of such titles as a woman could
                     inherit. Lucia was therefore Countess Vail, Lady Dare, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Two weeks after her father's death, the Earl of M—— called to see his
                     betrothed. Lucia met him frankly and composedly. She seemed suddenly to have
                     acquired a self-possession and dignity that struck the Earl as somewhat
                     remarkable; perhaps it was the long folds of the sweeping crape and bombazine
                     about her. She certainly held up her head and spoke with a firmness and
                     assuredness which he had never seen or known in her previously. But then she
                     was no longer an oppressed daughter, but a peeress of Great Britain, and
                     belonged to herself <emph>yet.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lucia motioned the Earl to a seat, then turning to him quietly and with womanly
                     pride, she said:</p>
                  <p>"My lord, I have to thank you for the kindness and consideration you evinced
                     for me when we met last. I assure you I esteem and prize it most highly. I was
                     just on the point of writing to you, but I am very glad you have come. It is
                     kinder and easier to speak in such matters than to write what I have to
                     communicate. I presume you anticipate what I desire to say?" Lucia paused and
                     looked inquiringly at him.</p>
                  <p>"I presume from your exordium, Madam, and the conversation which took place
                     when I had last the honor of meeting you, I <emph>can</emph> anticipate your
                     announcement. You desire to break off the engagement now existing between us,"
                     said the Earl, bitterly.</p>
                  <p>"I do, because I do not love you, my lord, and I would not willingly curse any
                     man for whom I have the esteem I feel for you with an unloving wife."</p>
                  <p>Lucia spoke gently, and extended her hand to him.</p>
                  <p>The Earl felt all this, of course, to be somewhat uncomfortable, the marriage
                     had been so widely announced. It was vexatious; any man would have considered
                     it so; but he was a good fellow. After all, <emph>she</emph> had never deceived
                     him, he never had been violently in love with her, though he liked her very
                     much, and the marriage would have suited all parties concerned very well. So he
                     took her hand kindly, instead of going into heroics and throwing it off, or
                     rejecting the friendship she proffered, as many a weaker man would have done.
                     On the contrary, he held her hand like a good brother, and, instead of bursting
                     into reproaches, he said simply and with considerable emotion, as if he was
                     petting a helpless child:</p>
                  <p>"Poor little thing! you must have had a hard time of it. You ought to have told
                     me sooner. Well, it is a good thing we weren't married, Lucia. It is much
                     easier settled now, is it not? But you might do worse than to take me, even
                     now."</p>
                  <p>Lucia smiled, though a tear stole down her cheek. Grasping the Earl's hand in
                     both of her's, she raised it to her lips and kissed it bravely.</p>
                  <p>"You are a good man, I like you very much, and am very grateful to you."</p>
                  <p>The astonished Earl looked confused, grew red, laughed, then fairly took her in
                     his arms and kissed her heartily.</p>
                  <p>"There, I have a right to that much, at least, since you won't let me marry
                     you. The truth is, I expect it is better for us both. I love you exactly as I
                     do Emma and Harriet (his sisters). I would do anything in the world for you,
                     and, if ever you should need a friend, come to me and you'll find one."</p>
                  <p>Lucia frankly expressed her gratitude to him, and asked him to stay to dinner,
                     made herself quite interesting and sociable the whole day, and when they parted
                     the Earl assured her that, although not desperate, he really suffered more than
                     he liked to acknowledge in giving her up; he was sorry she did not love
                     him.</p>
                  <p>Lucia heard of him afterwards in the Highlands, as being very devoted in his
                     attentions to the Lady Di Howard; and when he married that lady she sent his
                     wife a magnificent bridal gift of jewels and cashmeres.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">LUCIA IN NEW ORLEANS.</head>
                  <p>LUCIA resolved, now that she was her own mistress,—for she did just as she
                     pleased as far as "Cousin Vail" was concerned,—to put her long-cherished
                     intention of searching for Gerald into execution. She began making her
                     arrangements accordingly. Mr. Vail was much afflicted by her resolution,
                     especially as it was self-evident that <emph>he</emph> was too weak and infirm
                     to accompany her; but, as we have already said, under all Lucia's softness
                     there was a skeleton of strong bone. She did not belong wholly to the
                     cartilaginous species of animals, and she was fixed in her resolve to find her
                     brother if possible.</p>
                  <p>The Reverend Mr. Devere was installed rector of Hurst, vice Mr. Temple, who had
                     the grace to resign the living and remove himself to another more lucrative,
                     which was proffered him about this time. The remains of John Dodd were taken up
                     from Goodall's and deposited by the side of his wife. Lizzie Green had learned
                     to be an accomplished maid under Margery's teaching. Lucia decided to take
                     Lizzie with her. Lizzie had remained faithful to her red-headed lover, Jim
                     Dodd, and was very eager to join in the search, which would recover for her an
                     inamorato as well as restore "Master Gerald" to his people.</p>
                  <p>As we already know, Lucia started on her Quixotic expedition in the early part
                     of March, 1861. She landed on the wharf at New Orleans three weeks later. The
                     whole South was in a blaze of excitement. The ordinance of Secession had been
                     solemnly passed in nearly every Southern State. There was a conflict in many
                     hearts as to which government allegiance was first due,—the State, or Federal
                     government. According to the political creed of the South, it was owed first to
                     the <emph>State, which created,</emph> not to the Federal government, the
                        <emph>thing</emph> created. So there was very speedily almost entire
                     unanimity as to "which king" the "Bezonians" were to fight under. <emph>The
                        State, of course.</emph> But there were still differences of opinion as to
                     the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">modus operandi</foreign> in which this separation
                     and dissolution was to be accomplished. Some deemed it more expedient for the
                     whole fifteen Southern States to hold a convocation and go out of the Union
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en masse.</foreign> These were called the
                     co-operationists; but the majority of the people clung to the old doctrine of
                     the clear, independent sovereignty of the States, and said each State must
                     decide and act for itself, and <emph>these</emph> were called
                     Secessionists.</p>
                  <p>As to the fact of the <emph>necessity</emph> of <emph>separation</emph> there
                     was no difference among the people. It was simply as to the mode of separation.
                     The "Union men" of Louisiana, of any distinction, could be counted on the
                     fingers of one hand,—that is, the men who held the Websterian doctrine of a
                     consolidated central government.</p>
                  <p>The convention of Louisiana was still sitting in the City Hall in New Orleans.
                     Orators were making inflammatory speeches all over the South, fanning a flame
                     that needed no fuel to make it burst out and produce a general conflagration.
                     The fires had been latent and smouldering in the Southern heart for thirty
                     years. Thirty years of constant chafing had worn out the most stolid patience,
                     had rubbed the dry wood until the flame was educed at last. Every interest of
                     the agricultural, fiery, but indolent South was opposed to war, and it was not
                     until she had been goaded to frenzy, like Io, with the perpetual gad-fly of
                     radicalism, that, in utter desperation, in the extremity of hopelessness of any
                     better things, or of being able to retain her personal and domestic rights, her
                        <emph>republican</emph> government, she seized her arms and stood upon the
                     defensive, not willing to resign all that she believed made her prosperity and
                     her vitality without striking one blow for it. With <emph>her principles</emph>
                     she could do no less.</p>
                  <p>When Lucia arrived the streets were canopied with pelican flags, which streamed
                     from ropes suspended across them. They were crowded with bands of soldiers
                     marching out or returning from their drill. Every man sprung to arms. All but
                     the most essential trades were abandoned. The judge came down from his bench,
                     the lawyer from his office, the physician from the chambers of the sick,
                     merchants shut up their stores and shouldered their guns at the head of their
                     files of clerks. All men, nearly without exception, rich and poor, single or
                     married, old or young, fathers, brothers, husbands, lovers, all turned out with
                     an enthusiasm and a spirit of heroism and self-devotion that has been equalled,
                     but never surpassed, in the history of any people or nation. The senators and
                     representatives had come away from Washington city, believing there was no
                     chance of justice left there for Southern rights. Last of all, weeping as he
                     turned from the doors of the Capitol, came that upright and noble man, who,
                     whatever may have been his mistakes, we know never had a pulsation of heart
                     untrue to the South or to his God; who, whatever may be his fate, is enshrined
                     in the Southern heart as a true, faithful, loving son, whose errors she has
                        forgotten<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6308-00000050"/> in the remembrance of the
                     great love he bears her, and in his sufferings for her sake.</p>
                  <p>The times were terrible. Lucia's heart shrunk within her as she sat in her
                     lonely rooms at the hotel and listened to the tramp of soldiers, the music of
                     military bands, the rolling and rattling of artillery carriages over the stones
                     of the pavement, the braying of trumpets, the clash of cymbals, the measured
                     beat of drums, all the fierce, brilliant panoply of war in its early brassy
                     shining, are the flags are made ragged by shot-holes, and crimson with gouts of
                     human blood; before the grim cannon were marked with lurid spots on their
                     brightness—spots telling where their gunners bled their life away in defence,
                     as they believed, of all that made that life dear and valuable. Lucia sat alone
                     and trembled. Gerald was somewhere, somewhere in this mælstrom. Oh, if she
                     could but find him and extricate him from this whirlpool which might swallow
                     him up in an hour! She felt convinced that Gerald could not, nor would not,
                     remain inactive in such a period as this, she knew his fiery temperament too
                     well. Already some regiments had been sent from the city, under Bragg, to
                     Tallahasse. Jacob Doddson had gone off in one of them as private, so he was not
                     in the city. Lucia scarcely know what to do, and the thought sometimes crossed
                     her dismayed mind that perhaps she had better have taken Cousin Vail's advice
                     and remained in England; but then strong love would nerve her, and she would
                     kneel down and pray to God to help her in finding her brother. The conviction
                     would grow within her that she would, she must, discover him. She had brought
                     letters to the British Consul, and also to the Episcopalian bishops of the
                     United States from the Premier, and from the Archbishop of Canterbury. She felt
                        <emph>personally</emph> safe, even amidst the crash of battle, under the
                     ægis of the British flag and the panoply of the Anglican church. She had
                     already been kindly welcomed by the agents of the British government and the
                     Bishop of Louisiana, who called on her immediately upon the reception of the
                     commendatory letter she sent him through the consul from his "brother of
                     Canterbury."</p>
                  <p>In the midst of her musings, as Lucia felt so lonely and helpless, she
                     remembered Louise. She ordered Lizzy Green to put out her writing materials.
                     She wrote:</p>

                              <p>LOUISE,—Have you forgotten your school-friend, Lucia Dare? I know
                                 you have not; it is not in your noble nature to forget any one. You
                                 once loved; and I know you did love me once, in those old days in
                                 Paris, at Madame Bernard's. If I have been silent, and seemed cold
                                 and neglectful of you, dear Louise, during these long years of
                                 separation and silence, believe it was neither by my volition nor
                                 by my fault; but it was always regarded by me as a grievous
                                 affliction and true misfortune. My father is dead, Louise, and I am
                                 now mistress of myself, and can govern my own actions. My first
                                 thought on finding myself in this unfettered position was to carry
                                 out my old school project of coming to America to look for Gerald;
                                 and I am here in New Orleans for that purpose. I find the city in a
                                 greatly excited state: I scarcely know how to begin my search.
                                 Could you enlighten me or give me any aid? I feel very, very lonely
                                 in this great wide world, Louise, and long to see your bright, kind
                                 face, and lay my poor head on your sympathizing heart! Shall I come
                                 to you, or will you come to me?</p>

                  <p>Lucia folded her letter and waited until the Consul called, as he did usually
                     every day, to see if he could serve her or if she wanted any thing. Lord John
                     Russell's letters were very imperative in regard to her—she was one of the
                     richest heiresses, and to be respected accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Lucia said, after he was seated and they had exchanged the usual greeting:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. M——, do you know, or have you ever heard of a Philip Branger, who married
                     a Miss Peyrault, both of Louisiana?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, I know of both families; they are amongst the most respectable and
                     aristocratic of Louisiana. Does your ladyship desire any communication to be
                     made to Mr. Branger?—I can easily manager that; he lives on the Mississippi
                     river, on his plantation."</p>
                  <p>"I wish to send this," showing the letter "to Mrs. Philip Branger."</p>
                  <p>The Consul took the letter—"I can send it immediately, and will attend to it.
                     Mrs. Branger was educated in Paris, I think. I suppose your ladyship knew her
                     abroad?"</p>
                  <p>"I did. I was her bridesmaid." Then her checks flushed a shy-pale pink.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know any thing of her cousins—the Lauries?"</p>
                  <p>"The Lauries," observed the Consul, fixing his bright eyes upon her,
                     questioningly; "every body here, almost, knows Reginald Laurie. He has made
                     himself rather conspicuous, lately, in politics—he and Ashton. He is not in the
                     city just now—he is one of our Congressmen. His father resides at Natchez. I
                     think, indeed I know, now I come to think of it, they are cousins to the
                     Peyraults."</p>
                  <p>Lucia put up her hand as if to smooth back a trees that had fallen rather low,
                     but in reality to conceal the emotion she was exhibiting, by wearing deeper
                     roses than usual, as she asked, quite simply:</p>
                  <p>"He is not married yet, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not that I ever heard," replied the Consul, somewhat surprised at the
                     question from Lady Dare.</p>
                  <p>"I knew Mr. Laurie quite well in London," observed Lucia, calmly, "and had some
                     curiosity to learn what had become of all my American friends."</p>
                  <p>Finding she had nothing more to demand of him, Mr. M—— took his leave of her
                     ladyship, and hurried off to post the letter to Mrs. Branger.</p>
                  <p>A week later Lucia was sitting in her parlor alone, trying to read a novel of
                     Hawthorne's. She sat with her back to the door, so that she did not notice when
                     it was opened, nor was she roused from her constrained quiet until she felt two
                     clasping arms about her, and knew herself almost crushed on Louise Branger's
                     warm heart. Louise covered her face with kisses—wept over her in her old,
                     enthusiastic, ardent way. Lucia lay helpless and weeping on her friend's
                     bosom.</p>
                  <p>"You dear, precious, darling Lucia! Oh, how glad I am to see you—to get you
                     back again! I had a real fit of hysteries over your letter, Lucia! Philip and I
                     packed up, left the children, and came right away after you, because you belong
                     to us now—while you are in America, at least—and we will keep you and help you
                     to find your brother. I declare I am half crazy with joy over you, Lucy, and
                     Philip is almost as bad. May I call him in?—he is waiting outside the door in
                     the hall."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes! call him." Lucia started up and rushed to the door. "Come in, Mr.
                     Branger—oh, I am so glad to see you!" Lucia gave him both hands, which, in his
                     Southern fashion, he raised to his lips.</p>
                  <p>"I am sure <emph>we</emph> are delighted to see <emph>you.</emph> As for
                        <emph>Louise,</emph> she has been almost beside herself with joy, since she
                     got your letter; and found the fastest steamboat on the river too slow in
                     bringing her here," said Philip, eagerly.</p>
                  <p>How fast the tongues of the two friends did go! Philip, considerately, took
                     himself off and left them together. They talked all day and nearly all night,
                     and were at it again by early breakfast next day. It was arranged that Lucia
                     should return with them, and that Philip should begin his search in every
                     possible way for Gerald. Louise had a little "shopping" to do, of course—all
                     women have when they go to New Orleans—so they would stay a day or so, and
                     then—ho! for the plantation.</p>
                  <p>Lucia never said a word about Reginald, though Louise remarked:</p>
                  <p>"So Grace Sharp married a Russian Prince! Well, that was a good thing for her
                     and for Redgie. Where is Grace?"</p>
                  <p>Lucia explained that she was a leading belle in Paris, and more brilliant and
                     beautiful than ever."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, well," said Louise, "all is not gold that glitters. You see now,
                     Lucia"—her mobile face clouded—grew bitter and haughty, and a glance of intense
                     hate flashed from her black eyes—"you see what the Yankees are driving as to at
                     last! Lucia, every man with my blood in his veins, able to bear a musket, is in
                     training this day to fight them! They have trampled on us, cursed us long
                     enough! The South has thrown off the yoke. When your letter came to me I was
                     busy with my sewing-machine and sempstresses, making uniforms and strong
                     clothing for my cousins and my husband."</p>
                  <p>"Is Philip going to fight?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes! of course Philip's going. No Southern man can falter now!" Louise's voice
                     broke and trembled a little. "Do you think, Lucia, I could keep my husband back
                     when his country's existence and honor is at stake? Oh, no! Philip must
                     go!"—Louise clasped her hands and raised them, in her natural, vehement
                     gesticulation, towards heaven, "and I, Lucia, I can do nothing but pray for
                     him—for all, and for my poor, poor country!"</p>
                  <p>A thrill of fear as well as admiration ran over Lucia as she gazed upon her
                     friend, whose countenance was almost transfigured by its noble, lofty
                     emotion.</p>
                  <p>"Don't, Louise; you look like Joan D'-Arc."</p>
                  <p>"I would gladly be burnt, like La Pucelle, if I could bring victory to my
                     cause, Lucia! But let me tell you now about my babies.</p>
                  <p>Kneeling down, with one arm still around Lucia's waist, Louise proceeded to
                     open a package just brought in, containing dolls and toys for her children, and
                     also papers of large gilt military buttons and trimmings. "These are for the
                     children, and that," touching the brass facings, "is for Philip's clothes. You
                     will be delighted with my wee ones, Lucia. My little Philip and my
                     Aniennaide—they are so merry and sweet."</p>
                  <p>Louise dilated on her darlings' perfections as a fond mother would. She was
                     impatient to get back to them now to show them to Lucia. Philip said he had to
                     see General Bragg, and then he would be ready to start home. Bragg had been
                     given command of the troops of Louisiana. He had patriotically offered to
                     resign this promotion to Beauregard—fearing Beauregard might esteem it a slight
                     for him to be preferred by the Governor to this office; but of course
                     Beauregard would not accept this resignation on the part of Bragg. This
                     incident is only mentioned here to show how pure, and unsullied by any selfish
                     considerations, was the patriotism of all classes of our leaders in the early
                     stages of the war. Beauregard has become the boast of the state of Louisiana.
                     In the beginning of the contest he was highly esteemed as an engineer and
                     architect. He had given evidence of ability as a soldier in Mexico; but not
                     many predicted or anticipated for him the proud preeminence he has won since in
                        the<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6308-00000051"/> good opinion of his
                     countrymen! <emph>Bragg,</emph> however, was one of the few who did him the
                     justice to <emph>foresee</emph> and <emph>foretell</emph> it. Philip found time
                     to look after Lucia's business in the midst of his multitudinous commissions.
                     He came rushing into her parlor, where she was sitting with Louise, in great
                     agitation, the day before they were to leave New Orleans.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Madam, I think I have come upon some valuable traces of your brother,
                     by accident. I was obliged this morning to see Dr. Rock about an operation I
                     wished him to perform on a poor, afflicted negro boy of mine, whom I had
                     brought down with me to consult a surgeon for. I happened, carelessly, to speak
                     of you in connection with my wife, who is a favorite of Dr. Rock's. I spoke of
                     the business which brought you to America. I had barely gotten the words out of
                     my mouth, when the old Doctor clapped me on the shoulder with such a hearty
                     blow, it nearly knocked me down."</p>
                  <p>"'Edward Montague," my dear fellow, I can tell you all about him—at least I
                        <emph>can't</emph> tell you <emph>all</emph> about him, but I can say he is
                     alive, and a glorious fellow he is too. He was here to see me not two weeks
                     ago. He has been living somewhere up the river, clerking, or something of that
                     sort, making a living at any rate, for the last six years, since I saved his
                     life at the Charity Hospital. I think he said something about having been to
                     college or some where: I really never bother my mind with such details—he is
                     doing well, however. He said he was about to join the army. It is likely he is
                     off to Virginia before this—but perhaps I can find out. There was a red-headed
                     fellow, 'Jim,' that nursed him when he was sick, that I see often driving a
                     dray on the levee—I'll look out for him. I have not seen 'Jim,' however, for a
                     week or so, since I come to think of it. I expect he is gone off, too, with
                     Montague, as every body was with the army—however, I'll keep a look-out for
                     'Jim.' And I have several articles belonging to Edward Montague, which I will
                     bring to Lady Dare as soon as I can go home after them. In the meantime get out
                     of the light, and let me attend to this poor devil, whom I think I can
                     relieve.'</p>
                  <p>"So saying, the eccentric genius deliberately pushed me out of the way, called
                     his assistant, gave the boy chloroform, and in ten minutes the tumor was
                     removed, the wound bound up, and the poor negro more comfortable than he has
                     been for years. That is a great man, that Dr. Rock; he will be here directly,
                     Lady Dare; he went home in his buggy for the articles he spoke of, that he is
                     bringing for you to identify; and he does not drive slowly, I can assure
                     you—his time is too precious for that."</p>
                  <p>Lucia was greatly excited by Philip's news. She walked restlessly to and fro
                     from the window to the door, until she heard a heavy step outside of the
                     parlor, preceded by a lighter one of the servant, who was showing the way. The
                     servant threw open the door, with the announcement—"Dr. Rock."</p>
                  <p>Lucia rushed towards him, her hands clasped eagerly:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Dr. Rock—let me—see—please—oh—my brother!"</p>
                  <p>"How do you do, Lady Dare?" replied the imperturbable Dr., "I am glad to meet
                     you. My dear, I know it is your brother, because there is considerable family
                     resemblance between you. Though your coloring is different, an anatomist always
                     looks at conformation of bones and muscles. You are not unlike the sick boy I
                     saw at the charitable Sisters; but you are not so much like the stalwart,
                     bearded, six foot man I saw last week. The fellow has got a beard a half a foot
                     long now!"</p>
                  <p>"Only a week ago! only a week!" exclaimed Lucia. "Oh, to think Gerald probably
                     passed me, sitting in this very house weeping for him!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, never mind, my dear," said the old doctor, "you'll soon find him,
                     I have no doubt; I'll do all I can to help you—I wish I had thought of asking
                     the name of the place he has been living at, and the people he has been living
                     with; but the truth is I am rather absorbed in my profession, and forgetful
                     about other things, sometimes. Montague said he was doing well,' and I did not
                     ask further. Here are the things I spoke of."</p>
                  <p>The doctor pulled a parcel out of his pocket, carelessly wrapped in a piece of
                     newspaper, and tied with a yard of professional tape, and handed it to Lucia.
                     Her hands trembled so she could not untie the string. Louise cut it hastily
                     with her scissors. They watched Lucia with breathless interest. When she beheld
                     the watch, the sleeve-buttons, the initials, all so familiar and so dear, she
                     dropped her face on her hands, and wept aloud. The silent witnesses scarcely
                     knew whether her's were tears of joy or of disappointment; but she soon checked
                     her sobs, dried her eyes, and extending her hand to Dr. Rock, she poured forth
                     a flood of thanksgivings and praises to him, for his. Samaritan kindness to her
                     wayward Gerald. The old doctor stopped her in the midst:</p>
                  <p>"Stuff! Pshaw, child! don't be nonsensical. I only did as I would be done
                     by."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Rock then gave Lucia a minute detail of Gerald's illness up to the time he
                     sent him to the sea shore. Since that he had seen him only occasionally, but
                     knew he was doing very well. After allowing himself to be cross-examined in
                     every way suggested by Lucia's anxious affection, he rose to go, leaving the
                     articles in Lady Dare's hands. Lucia called after him:</p>
                  <p>"Doctor, how much did you advance my brother on these things?"</p>
                  <p>"It does not matter about that now," said the impatient doctor, turning
                     red.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, it does!" insisted Lucia.</p>
                  <p>"Well!"—taking out a leaf from his pocket-book, he wrote an order—"give this
                     amount to the Charity Hospital. Good morning, Lady Dare—good morning, Mrs.
                     Branger."</p>
                  <p>The doctor was gone.</p>
                  <p>Lucia read an order for two thousand dollars, in favor of the hospital. She
                     doubled it, and sent the amount, in Dr. Rock's name, as a thank-offering. The
                     next day they went up to Mr. Branger's plantation. Philip was to write to see
                     if he could discover anything more about Gerald. Lucia felt she had gained much
                     in learning him to be certainly alive and well. But then he was in the
                     patriotic army, and her heart grew cold again with fear and apprehension; but
                     Louise and Philip comforted her with their buoyant hopes, and Lucia smiled
                     through her tears. As they passed Natchez Louise pointed out the woods behind
                     which Mr. Laurie lived. Lucia felt the blood rush to her cheek, as she looked
                     towards the spot where Reginald's family resided. If she could but have seen
                     the group gathered in the hall of that house just at that very moment, her
                     wanderings would have ended. Louise looked longingly at the city.</p>
                  <p>"I declare, Philip, if it was not for my babies, I would stop at Natchez for a
                     day; I would like Lucia to see Annie Laurie; but I am nearly crazy to see my
                     'piccaninies!' You'll have to wait for another time, Lucia, to know our
                     nonpareil."</p>
                  <p>Lucia acquiesced. What excuse had she for desiring to know Reginald's father
                     and family? Her maid, Lizzie Green, re-echoed the sigh that fell,
                     unconsciously, from Lucia's lips, as the boat turned the bend, putting Natchez
                     out of sight.</p>
                  <p>Lizzie was tearfully contemplating a broad gold ring with a turquoise set, on
                     her middle finger.</p>
                  <p>"Who gave you that ring, Lizzie?"</p>
                  <p>"Jim Dodd," sobbed Lizzie, "and I promised to wear it to my dying day, and I
                        <emph>will</emph> too!"</p>
                  <p>Lizzie had heard all that Dr. Rock said the day he called to see Lucia, and she
                     knew "Jim" was still in existence, a flourishing, prosperous dray-man, and now
                     a glorious soldier. Lizzie's sympathies followed her heart like Lucia's in
                     spite of English prejudices, or prepossessions—they were both going to be warm
                     in the cause of the South—they too had <emph>all</emph> at stake in the
                     Confederate army, and began to look on every grey uniform with deep interest.
                     Did not Gerald wear it, and Reginald, and Jim Dodd?"</p>

                  <p>LUCIAN COURTENAY returned "home" as soon as it was clearly foreshown that the
                     Democratic party would be defeated in the Presidential election, and coming
                     events began to cast long, dark shadows over the whole United States. A whole
                     nation was growing convulsed and throbbing with Ætnean anger. "Home" he called
                     Mr. Laurie's now. They called it so, and wrote it so for him. Mr. Laurie had
                     taken one of his strong, unchangeable fancies for Lucian, and had as regularly
                     adopted him in his affections and thoughts as if he had had a right to the
                     young man.</p>
                  <p>Annie was very fond of him; and Miss Smith, who still remained as a tried and
                     trusted friend, though her task of education was ended, as far as Margaret was
                     concerned, was a firm adherent of Lucian's. She kept him well supplied in all
                     sorts of crochet kuick-nacks, such as guard-chains, purses, smoking-caps,
                     slippers, pen-wipers, and bags lined with oil-silk to keep his sponges in. She
                     used to embroider his initials on dozens of pocket-handkerchiefs, and socks,
                     and send them. Lucian was greatly beloved by them all, and the reciprocated
                     their affection most warmly.</p>
                  <p>Lucian had grown to be a noble man now. In his twenty-first year, he had begun
                     to think of returning to England when this cloud of war came to brood over the
                     country. Lucian felt he could not leave the South, just then. He owed her
                     something; and too, there was danger and excitement promising in the distance;
                     there was too much Dare blood in his veins for him to forego that temptation,
                     though Lucian Courtenay was a very different man from what Gerald Dare promised
                     to be. Every good quality in his nature had been cultivated and developed in
                     the last six years, and the old <emph>Dare-</emph>"devil" had been smothered if
                     not eradicated by the profuse blossoming of these best qualities. He was a
                     handsome man; every body said so—rather old-looking for his years—his eyes, and
                     hair, and long beard were so very dark, and then he was altogether Miss Smith's
                     ideal of a man—grave and subdued in deportment, with a touch of Sir Hugh's
                     hauteur, that only made him <emph>distinguished.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Betsy said, "Somehow, Mars Lucian held his head high up, like a ra-al
                     gentleman—none o' your slidin' ways like Mars Ed. Morris."</p>
                  <p>Lucian <emph>was</emph> handsome, and he looked honest and true, which was
                     better.</p>
                  <p>Lucian came "home;" he was joyfully welcomed; but he was rather troubled
                     concerning Margaret. It all happened in this way:</p>
                  <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6308-00000052"/>
                  <p>Lucian had not been "home" for nearly three years. Annie Laurie and Miss Smith
                     both kissed him very affectionately upon his arrival, as if he was their
                     younger brother. Mr. Laurie embraced and blessed him; Betsy and Jane even
                     saluted his hand; but Margaret———</p>
                  <p>Lucian had gotten through all the embracings, and was standing in his traveling
                     gear, still holding Annie Laurie's hand, replying to the questions with which
                     Mr. Laurie, and Miss Smith, and Annie were all playing him, about his journey,
                     not soto voce, but <foreign xml:lang="ITA">una voce,</foreign> so that it
                     required some skill to answer all at once and each question accurately. Betsy
                     and Jane standing in the back ground, like the chorus in the Greek tragedies,
                     reiterating in asides to each other, what "Mars Lucian" said, nodding their
                     handkerchiefed heads in approbation occasionally at a reply. Lucian just began
                     to say—looking around in surprise:</p>
                  <p>"Why, where's Mar"—</p>
                  <p>He did not get the remainder of that lovely name out of his lips before the
                     door opened quietly, and a young lady entered, calm, tall, queen-like, fair and
                     stately as Juno, or Miss <emph>Smith,</emph> which is more than an equivalent
                     to the white-armed wife of Jupiter. Lucian dropped Annie's hand, and stepped
                     quickly forward with outstretched arms, to embrace the beautiful, charming
                     friend; but he might as well have tried again, as he did once, to embrace the
                     phantom form of Lucia Vail. Margaret drew back with a most unmistakable impulse
                     of dignity and pride, put one snowy hand in his extended ones, and said in the
                     sweetest voice Lucian had ever heard:</p>
                  <p>"Welcome home, Mr. Courtenay! I am very glad to see you again."</p>
                  <p>Lucian felt then as if, not a pitcher, but a whole <emph>bucket</emph> full of
                     ice water had been suddenly dashed over him. Annie Laurie smiled in amusement
                     at Margaret's superb queenliness, and Lucian's evident discomfiture. Miss Smith
                     looked on approvingly; her pupil was worthy of that incomparably proper, and
                     matchlessly dignified woman! Poor Lucian did all that was left him to do—he
                     kissed Margaret's hand, to which operation she submitted as graciously and
                     condescendingly as Victoria or Eugene might have done. Jenny, who followed in
                     Margaret's wake, made a profound courtesy, and coyly put the tips of her very
                     black fingers in Lucian's hand, instead of her former warm "Howdye," said with
                     an imitative toss of her woolly head: "I'se glad to see you home, Mars
                     Lucian."</p>
                  <p>It is <emph>very</emph> vulgar to be surprised at any thing; but Lucian
                        <emph>was</emph> surprised on this occasion, although he was a hero, as will
                     be conclusively proved, it is hoped, in the course of this true history.</p>
                  <p>Lucian found himself very often in the course of this and other days, regarding
                     Margaret with wondering eyes and perplexed thoughts. Her
                        "<emph>transformation</emph>" was splendid as unexpected. What a magnificent
                     "aurora" she did make altogether, quite equal to that of her old favorite
                     peacock moth, which is the prettiest thing almost in the world! He had not seen
                     her for three years,—had always remembered her as his dear, affectionate,
                     frank, loving, almost <emph>too</emph> childish friend; and now, oh! gracious,
                     there sat, not two yards from him, with trains of muslin sweeping on the floor,
                     tranquilly leaning very slightly over her tall embroidery cushion, which was a
                        <emph>Swiss</emph> one, made to stand up at, if one chose, embroidering a
                     velvet chair-cover for her grandfather,—a most elegant young woman, who would
                     have answered very well for a Diana, or Artemis, at Rome or Athens. This young
                     person seemed, for all her extraordinary loveliness, to have reversed the fable
                     of Pygmalion. This time the living form had been crystalized—at least, so far
                     as Lucian was concerned, it seemed to be so. Lucian was very uncomfortable. His
                     heart bled; he had lost his friend—his dear little Margaret. This was not "his"
                     Margaret at all; <emph>she was her own</emph> very evidently. Lucian thought a
                     great deal in these few first days. Miss Guion was not embarrassed, nor
                     unfriendly. It would have been rather more comfortable if she <emph>had</emph>
                     been, Lucian thought, one would have had some ground to go upon. But this cool,
                     polished ice, it was rather slippery when one came upon it unexpectedly, and
                     without skates. Lucian did very little else that first week but watch Margaret.
                     He found she was ordinarily quiet; her head curved back magnificently on her
                     long neck. She was not a great talker, but when she <emph>did</emph> speak,
                     Lucian discovered himself turning quickly to listen to the musical tones of the
                     sweet voice, whose every well chosen, sensible word fell like a pure rounded
                     pearl, or transparent brilliant, or a perfect well-cupped rose from that
                     exquisite mouth.</p>
                  <p>Margaret had a rarely beautiful voice both in speaking and singing,—Calve had
                     trained her. Her "method" in vocalizing was regarded as something
                     extraordinary. Margaret knew how to draw out those long, clinging oboe tones,
                     that seem breathing, right off, the tetra-chord Horace talks about, "voce, modó
                     hâc, resonant quœ chordis quatuor ima"—so tender, so full of pathos, from those
                     heart-strings, that they always went straight into other hearts. A voice she
                     had that made people silent, and suggested soft thoughts of heaven, and the
                     memories of absent or blessed dead friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>And she would not kiss Lucian!</emph> Well, Lucian looked very often at
                     the ripe, red, red lips, so lovely in their haughty curves, and he wished he
                     had his little Margaret back again, instead of this vestal virgin, crowned with
                     the braids of her own lustrous bronze hair. Even the hair was changed—not in
                     color—it was still the same peculiar gold-red brown it always had been; but
                     there was not a ringlet to be seen anywhere; all was closely reefed, as a
                     vessel in a bad gale—not the end of a stray lock visible: one great wide,
                     smooth braid, coiled round her head like a diadem, then wrapped round in a knot
                     at the back of the neck—that was all; the shower of ringlets had come to
                     that—to that cable of twisted hair. Lucian was conscious that the cable suited
                     very well with Margaret's style now, but he used to love to tangle his fingers
                     in her long curls. Lucian thought he would consult Annie Laurie about it all;
                     nobody was afraid to consult Annie Laurie about any troubles. So Lucian
                     followed Annie out of the room and said, "Annie, what has changed Margaret so?
                     Have I offended her—do tell me?"</p>
                  <p>Annie smiled.</p>
                  <p>"Why, dear Lucian," she replied, taking his hand and leading him up to a long
                     mirror: "Look here. What do you see? Is this tall, long-bearded, moustached man
                     the slender, smooth-faced boy who quitted us three years ago? Don't you see you
                     left Margaret a child?—you find her a woman; and I assure you, such a stately
                     demoiselle that she frequently overpowers <emph>me.</emph> She would have done
                     admirably at the court of Queen Elizabeth, and could have been worthily the
                     subject of Spenser or Sir Phillip Sidney's homage and songs; but she is really
                     good and affectionate," added Annie, warmly, "and much attached to you."</p>
                  <p>Lucian, satisfied with Annie's explanation, began to study his old play-mate
                     under this new phase; perhaps it did not add much more to the peace of his
                     heart. He found "Miss Guion" more troublesome to that organ than "Margaret" had
                     ever been. He called her "Miss Guion," and "Miss Margaret," now, and Margaret
                     relaxed immediately in manner; she became more sociable. She never laid her
                     "retenue" entirely aside—she couldn't, it was her nature now to be calm, and
                     composed, and dignified. Such very tall, well-proportioned women, have a
                     breadth of mental structure, conforming to their physique.</p>
                  <p>Miss Guion was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">belle.</foreign> There never was a
                     Sun-ness among the Natchez Indians, who had more devoted, nor more prostrate
                     adorers than this modern daughter of Phœbus-Apollo. Lucian very quickly went
                     down on his knees at the foot of the ranks of devoteés.</p>
                  <p>"Sunt plerumque regum voluntates vehementes, et inter se contrariæ," Tacitus
                     says of kings. We may apply the same to "queens" like Margaret, who have
                     "vehement wills," and who don't always know or always <emph>choose</emph> to
                     know, what their own hearts desire.</p>
                  <p>Oh! youth, love, and folly! The bright, bright dreams, that come and pass away
                     like the golden clouds of the morning! Theme of poets, forever, and remembrance
                     of statesmen! Why is it that all pause as they hurry on, in vain pursuit of the
                     transitory gauds and perishable crowns of earth, to look wistfully, pitifully,
                     sympathetically at the two dreaming hearts of yonder children, under the bower
                     of roses, dropping hydromel, who sit there with clasping hands, enchanted with
                     the dawn of life's day, with the songs of birds, the upspringing waters of
                     hope's sweet falling, ever rising fountains, and—with each other? Why do they
                     stop to breathe a blessing and a prayer?</p>
                  <p>It is all very well to be a philosopher—Lucian thought it a great deal better
                     to be in love, as he very soon was. A maiden's heart is a Chinese puzzle
                     sometimes, and it has to be confessed that Miss Guion was not very easy to
                     decipher always by anybody, not even by herself. She did not exactly know what
                     she did want, "But at any rate, she was not going to let Lucian Courtenay
                     think, because she was fond of him as a child, and was fond of him now, in a
                     certain sort of way, that she"—</p>
                  <p>In short, Margaret, as we have before stated, was not only a queen in her own
                     right of womanly loveliness, but she was taut soit peu coquette! So Lucian did
                     not have such a very good time as it might be supposed he would, considering
                     his opportunities: living in the same house, old intimacy, etc., etc., etc.
                     Lucian built up a very pretty romance for himself, leading home an American
                     bride to his ancestral halls; but he was to woo and win her à la Troubadour. It
                     was to be a "<emph>modified</emph>" Lord of Burleigh affair—Mr. Laurie's
                     grand-daughter being not altogether on the footing of the Lord of Burleigh's
                     peasant love. Indeed there often came moments of bitter gloom in Lucian's soul,
                     when he would feel convinced that a girl with as brilliant a lot in her own
                     country, might even refuse to expatriate herself for the coronet of an English
                     Peeress. Margaret had everything—money, beauty, rank among her own people. What
                     could he offer more? And then, she was so cool and indifferent! Lucian would
                     retire in disgust to his lonely chamber, from whence he could hear the echo of
                     Margaret's sweetest voice in light merry talk, or listened to her low chime of
                     laughter, sometimes, though rarely, awakened by the wit of some one of her
                     numerous beaux. With the stupid ones, Margaret played billiards. They had a
                     fine table belonging to Reginald, and Margaret was fond of the game. Lucian
                     felt every knock given to those blessed balls by Margaret's cue, fall like
                     Thor's hammer on his melancholy<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6308-00000053"/>
                     heart. But then, there were hours of consolation, too; for sometimes she played
                     billiards or rode on horseback with <emph>him,</emph> and she would sit on
                     rainy days over her embroidery frame, and let him read to her, as he used to do
                     under the old oak; and now Lucian read Moore, and Byron, and Owen Meredith,
                     instead of Scott, and Margaret would sing to him whenever he asked her; but as
                     a general rule she rather fled lover-like attentions from Lucian Courtenay. And
                     yet Lucian did not despair—"Hope" we know is a good "lover's staff for him to
                     walk withall," and all "the <emph>other men</emph>" were very jealous of him.
                     That was encouraging. The "other men" were Margaret's suiters, numerous as
                     Penelope's.</p>
                  <p>But the war cloud burst—Reginald came home. He was one of the first men to
                     volunteer in a cavalry company.</p>
                  <p>Of course Mr. Laurie's family were borne away like all the rest by the mountain
                     torrent of patriotism, that was pouring in a flood of feeling all over the
                     South. Could Annie Laurie be cool and collected and uninterested in the
                     presence of such high and lofty impulses?</p>
                  <p>Margaret was ardent, glowing in her absorption in the cause of the South. She
                     forgot even her coquetries, her coldness and "proprieties." Lucian glowed with
                     enthusiasm as she did. Her lovers all volunteered immediately. Miss Smith began
                     to make housewives with an infinite number of pockets, which she filled up with
                     soap, needles, pins, thread, tapes, buttons, paper, pens, everything—all the
                     small articles her fancy suggested could, by any possibility, be useful to a
                     soldier. She presented these to all her acquaintances going to the army.</p>

                  <p>The strife is ended now for us; the birds, frightened from the peaceful repose
                     of their accustomed nests, by the roar of cannon and the rattle of artillery,
                     are returned to the groves of orange and myrtle left standing in our desolated
                     gardens; the sunshine is as clear; sky as blue; the grass is greener than it
                     was, springing from the soil enriched by such precious blood, poured so freely
                     over the dear land. Nature smiles, to-day, as brightly, as joyously as if there
                     had never been this crash of battles, this fearful conflict—ignorant that a
                     people has gone down, with their hopes and their pride, into the dark whirlpool
                     of destiny. Yet when the South is asked, like Medea:</p>

                  <p>Harold Ashton was major in a New Orleans regiment, Edward Morris was a captain
                     in another. Lucian joined a band of scouts belonging to Wirt Adams' regiment,
                     as a private, but he was soon elected to a commissioned office, and rose to be
                     first-lieutenant and at last captain. Margaret was very tearful and almost
                     tender towards Lucian the last few days previous to his departure. She only
                     followed Miss Smith's example, however; that model of feminine propriety was to
                     be discovered almost at any hour of the twenty-four, marking Lucian's socks and
                     clothes, with fast-dropping tears as well as indelible ink or red embroidering
                     cotton. At last the partings were said. Harold Ashton had made his farewell
                     visit and strained Annie to his breast in his last passionate clasp.</p>
                  <p>"My Harold," Annie whispered, "I have no charge to give you; you will always do
                     your full duty, I know—you <emph>know</emph> you are <emph>my</emph> life! God
                     be with you, <emph>soul</emph> of my <emph>soul!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie was more cordial to Harold when he found he was going away; shook
                     hands quite warmly, like himself. He gave a solemn and equal blessing to
                     Reginald and to Lucian the morning they were to go off with their regiments.
                     Lucian turned to Margaret, after all had embraced him but her, sadly, with only
                     his extended hand, "good-bye, dear Margaret."</p>
                  <p>Margaret sobbed, Lucian grasped both her hands impulsively in his, and there,
                     in the presence of them all, pressed them again and again to his bearded lip.
                     Margaret snatched her hands from his grasp, rushed off to her own apartment
                     without a word even of farewell. She was past speaking. In all, all partings,
                     which may be forever, how weak and low the human heart falls before the might
                     of sorrow! Poor dumb creatures that we are, without words even to express the
                     intensity of our <emph>woe,</emph> much less our <emph>love!</emph> We can only
                     consign what transcends our limited power of human utterance to "the
                     compassions which fail not" of the infinitely loving Creator, looking there
                     only for sympathy and comprehension.</p>
                  <p>What a true utterance from the heart of the truest woman who ever had the gift
                     of song, is that valedictory of Mrs. Browning's: <q>

                  <p>I FIND myself, dear Cousin Vail, a petted and warmly-welcomed guest in this
                     pretty home of Louise's. We have very mistaken ideas in England about the style
                     of living of these American planters. Louise's establishment is very extensive,
                     and she reigns like a sovereign over her domain. I discover every day a
                     thousand things which interest and surprise me. Coming here, with all my
                     English prejudice, I did not expect to find such a patriarchal mode of
                     existence, and such warm affection and ties of mutual interest between slaves
                     and their owners. I do not like property in man; but I am asking myself whether
                     it is not simply the "<emph>nomenclature</emph>" which is wrong, and whether
                     these negroes, even with this enforced labor, during certain hours of the day,
                     do not really enjoy all the primitive and essential rights of humanity? Custom,
                     and sympathy, and interest, and policy have certainly wonderfully ameliorated,
                     if they have not absolutely changed, what we call slavery, into a very just
                     system of life. At any rate, these slaves of Louise's are happy and contented.
                     But I won't occupy my pages with moral discussions on this subject; we will
                     talk over these things fully when I get "<emph>home</emph>" again. Now, I will
                     only jot down, from time to time, passing events and incidents that will
                     interest you.</p>
                  <p>Philip is gone with his company. He has ordered Louise to remove back from the
                     Mississippi river to another estate they own in an interior parish—he is afraid
                     for us to remain here. He doubts very seriously if the river can be held by the
                     Southerners.</p>
                  <p>The overseers have already gone with nearly all the negroes. Philip is a very
                     extensive land-owner—has large tracts of lands in the north-west of the State,
                     and he thinks it will be safer to occupy his negroes on some more remote
                     plantations. It was very affecting to see the negroes go off, marching in
                     procession, two and two, singing wild, plaintive Methodist hymns as they
                     walked, following a long, long train of wagons which preceded them, laden with
                     their goods and most cherished valuables. It was surprising to see the articles
                     they had massed together in those wagons! Louise ordered the overseers to be as
                     indulgent as possible to the negroes' whims—so they had piled up the queerest,
                     most useless, and most incongruous articles—iron pots, kettles, tubs, chicken
                     coops, old clothes in long sacks, stuffed to bursting. You never could conceive
                     all the trash they had collected together—about as useful as the glass beads or
                     broken bits of mirrors of savages. The small children were transported in large
                     covered wagons, the nurses and old women sitting solemnly in the midst to carry
                     the babies, and every wagon swarming with tiny, black, woolly heads and bright
                     eyes, peeping through every crevice of the curtains. Louise moved about among
                     "the people," seeing after the arrangements for their comfort. She promised to
                     join them very soon. They seemed satisfied when she told them that, though
                     before their countenances had expressed some anxiety. They did not understand
                     all this movement about them, and were reluctant to quit their well-known
                     localities. Like all inferior organizations, they have strong animal
                     attachments "to place." Louise stood by me, her little children clinging to her
                     skirts, watching the long procession or train, until it disappeared from her
                     gaze, her mobile face expressing every fitful emotion of her fiery soul. I
                     could almost read her thoughts: the flush of anger—the indignation at what she
                     believed wrong and oppression—the deadly hate of her enemies, as the last wagon
                     passed out of sight, and the mournful hymn died away—the quick, hot tears
                     gushed from her eyes—and she hid her face a moment in her hands, as she sobbed
                     passionately. I slipped my arm about her waist—her proud head drooped an
                     instant on my shoulder as she moaned:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my country—my Philip, and my poor slaves!"</p>
                  <p>But the short weakness was soon over. Raising her head, and straightening her
                        tall<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6308-00000054"/> form, she lifted her hand
                     and shook it defiantly:</p>
                  <p>"God—God! avengeous! Save us from such tyrants, or let us perish! If all must
                     go down in this whirlpool—if I am to survive, bereft of all—country, friends,
                     wealth—at least give me death, never dishonor—never submission to that detested
                     race!"</p>
                  <p>I must confess, Cousin John, that this vivid, panther-like nature has powerful
                     influence over mine. I fear I am imbibing all Louise's prejudices against "the
                     Yankees." But you know the fascination, the witchery of Louise Branger's
                     nature—her eloquence, her pure romantic truth; her noble, unselfish,
                     high-strung soul attracts one with the force of magnetism! She is perfectly
                     adored by her family and her slaves. I admire and love her inexpressibly.</p>
                  <p>I hear there is an "Edward Montague," a staff-officer in Texas. I shall follow
                     this slight clew—will accompany Louise, and try to get so far, at least, as
                     Shreveport.</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>New Orleans is blockaded. I shall send my letters by private hand to the
                     British Consul in the city, hoping he may be able to forward them.</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>1863. We are on our way to Texas—Louise and her little ones, all the slaves,
                     and I and Lizzie Green. I have not been able yet to learn any more about
                     "Edward Montague," except that there is such a man upon the staff of General
                     ——. I must go and see him for myself. Gerald would not understand, and might
                     conceal himself yet, from even me, who love him so much—who would follow him
                     over the world at a bidling! My darling—my darling!</p>
                  <p>We lead the strangest life, Cousin Vail,—"camp out," as they call it, every
                     night, take our meals gipsy-fashion, by the roadside. We have tents, Louise and
                     I, but the negroes threw away their tents as too cumbrous, and they content
                     themselves with bowers, or lairs, built up of pine branches. It is very
                     picturesque. We stop for the night, usually at sunset, near a stream of water.
                     The wagons are drawn up in rows, children, old women, and bed-clothes emptied
                     out of them, and then such a motley scene of confusion you could not imagine,
                     everybody so busy. Our tents hoisted, while Louise and I sit on a log, or
                     fallen tree-trunk, and survey the excited multitude of negroes building up
                     their green booths, shaking out their blankets, rattling skillets and
                     frying-pans over the numerous fires which spring up as if by magic. Louise
                     showed me the "fire-horn" of the negroes, a small end of cows' horn filled with
                     half burned cotton lint, and a jack-knife, and a piece of common flint. The
                     children race about like mad things, joyful to escape from the confinement of
                     the wagons. Louise's little ones play with the tiny darkies; she does not
                     pretend to keep them asunder. "The little negroes are not wicked," she says, in
                     answer to my remarks on this point. "They are very good to my children, and I
                     like my little ones to love these little slaves. Why, <emph>I</emph> love the
                     poor creatures, Lucia." And so she does. Every evening she goes about among her
                     slaves, seeing after the sickly and delicate ones.</p>
                  <p>Philip is to be transferred to this department. Louise is so glad of it; she
                     will be able to see her husband sometimes. She hopes It is really right
                     pleasant here on the roadside sometimes when the night is clear and the stars
                     are bright and soft. The pine-trees murmuring hoarsely in the cool, sighing
                     breeze,—the limpid streams, gurgling, glimmering silverly in the moonlight,
                     sometimes pausing to fill large still pools fringed with ferns and green
                     mosses. Such numbers of glow worms, too: the grass and mosses are all alive
                     with these tiny living lamps of love. The flowers are peculiar in these pine
                     forests. It seems to me as if they all assume pyramidal spiked forms; for
                     instance, the eupatoriums, which are so profuse in clusters of round, flat,
                     feathery blossoms, or hang in tufts upon rampant vines near the river in the
                     swamps of Louisiana, here take the stiff, spiked, pyramidal shape, and grow up
                     pointed bloom-heads of low shrubs. I find a number of strange new plants. The
                     insects, too, are <emph>eccentric.</emph> So many-jointed, horse-hair looking
                     creatures, that seem spikes of pine, green and vegetable in aspect, but with
                     such long, awkward legs, with which they scamper off in the twinkling of an eye
                     on being touched. But I don't like the numerous caterpillars and spiders, and
                     even snakes; sometimes we see <emph>them</emph> gliding away under the dead
                     wood through the thin, wiry grasses.</p>
                  <p>The crossing the ford of Black River this morning was very picturesque. This
                     stream here had subsided within its banks, receding into the very narrow
                     channel in its centre, leaving a broad stretch of entirely level meadow land
                     running along each margin, extending, perhaps, a hundred or more yards from the
                     brink of the present river to the bases of the ridges, or high crests, rising
                     so much probably as forty or fifty feet perpendicularly, which form in the
                     flood, or winter time, the customary banks of the river. These high ridges were
                     wooded with primeval forest trees to the very edge. The river makes a sudden,
                     bold curve just above and also below the crossing, widening in the turn, but
                     bringing by this abrupt curvature the lines of stately forest trees together,
                     forming thus a magnificent amphitheatre of several miles dimensions.</p>
                  <p>The short, level sward of this artificial central meadow was emerald green,
                     till it met on either side the pure limpid water, flowing in liquid crystal,
                     winding in its heart. Beautiful cattle, white, speckled, and mixed with red,
                     were quietly feeding on the rich grasses. Some of the negroes, mounted on
                     horses of varied color, white, black, and sorrel, were splashing across the
                     sparkling shallow stream; the heavy wagons, slowly descending or ascending the
                     precipitous roads cut through the high banks on either side, the negroes
                     swarming about these wagons, clinging around them like so many bees about their
                     comb. The variety of color in costume,—the heavier greys and purples relieved
                     by garments more fanciful, of bright crimsons or yellows; the laughing,
                     shouting, heaving, pulling, holding back by the huge wagons, and the brilliant,
                     radiant canopy of blue fire we call "sky" over it all, made one of the most
                     striking landscapes I have ever seen. The day was glorious in sunshine. The
                     green of the woods and the grasses and the water was almost scintillating,
                     brilliant, in beauty, and the rich deep brown of the steep, rugged banks—that
                     perfect chocolate brown—gave tone and contrast to all the lighter color.</p>
                  <p>I crossed first in my carriage, taking little Philip and Amenaide with me, to
                     keep them out of harm's way. The little creatures are so fearless they dart off
                     from their nurse unexpectedly, like humming-birds, and fly in the midst of the
                     negroes, and sometimes in dangerous proximity to heavily-laden wagons lumbering
                     down these descents. They are so lovely, so full of life and spirit—little
                     sparks of fire. Louise followed; and while I sat down, holding the babies fast
                     by their wee hands, watching the crossing from the height of a safe hillock,
                     she stood directing and advising, both with hand and voice, the crossing of the
                     caravan with its heavy freight of human life. If I had Millais pencil I would
                     like to paint this scene.</p>
                  <p>Often, in traveling along on our slow journey, little Philip and Amenaide grow
                     weary of the confinement of the carriage and begin to cry and fret. The elder
                     negro men or women approach, and ask to have the children lifted out. They take
                     the tiny creatures up in their arms, seat them on their shoulders, talk to
                     them, fill their little hands with wild flowers or large pine burrs, and in a
                     few minutes the weary children are laughing, prattling away so merrily, happy
                     as imaginary kings and queens, or a Scandinavian prince exalted on his shield,
                     in the midst of their sable attendants. Louise never feels the slightest
                     timidity or anxiety about her little ones while in the hands of her slaves.
                     Sometimes we drive on rapidly to the camping-ground for the night, and the
                     negroes walking with her babes on their shoulders do not come up for a half
                     hour or so; but she is never uneasy. If I express any anxiety she laughs at me.
                     "That's your English prejudice, Lucia. The negroes love my babes and love me. I
                     am not at all afraid to trust them." My ideas in regard to Southern slavery are
                     certainly becoming strangely modified.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THERE'S A REAPER WHOSE NAME IS DEATH.</head>
                  <p>WE have been nearly two months en route. We travel only ten miles per diem, as
                     the negroes walk for the most part, and the roads are sandy and often very
                     heavy.</p>
                  <p>The measles have broken out among the slaves. Louise is very troubled and most
                     unhappy about her little children; still she will not desert her sick slaves.
                     We have pitched our camp in a shady pine grove, and wait till the epidemic
                     abates. Louise wants me to leave her and hasten on to Texas, but I will not.
                     She devotes herself to the sick. I aid her by weighing out medicines, and doing
                     what I can.</p>
                  <p>Louise's children are both ill this morning. It is piteous to see the dry agony
                     of their mother's eyes! The little creatures lie tossing in delirium on their
                     bed—spread on the carpet on the ground in Louise's tent. Several of the negroes
                     have died. Louise had them decently buried; and taking her manual, she read the
                     office for the dead over each one, as far as it was lawful for a lay person to
                     read it. Before the children died (the negroes I mean), she baptized them with
                     her own hands. She spoke so tenderly, so kindly to the weeping mothers!</p>
                  <p>Louise's babies are very ill. Old Martha, the "plantation nurse," came to-day
                     to Louise's tent, where we were both kneeling down by the sick babies. Old
                     Martha held a vial which had contained quinine, now nearly emptied of the
                     precious powder—</p>
                  <p>"Look here, mistress, the quinine is most gone, so I thought I'd bring this
                     what's left to you, to keep for the blessed children. You know it's on possible
                     to get any more here in this ere wilderness."</p>
                  <p>Louise looked up from her task of bathing Philip's burning head with cold
                     water—"Is that all that's left, Martha?"</p>
                  <p>"Every grain—you see the measles left them children all so weak I had to give
                     it to them pretty free."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know, but how are Jimmy and Sallie? did you give them the doses I
                     ordered for them?"</p>
                  <p>"No, I never, mistress; seeing how little was left, I thought you ought to keep
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"But, Martha, those children will die without the tonic—they must have it."</p>
                  <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6308-00000055"/>
                  <p>"Deed then, mistress," persisted Martha, shaking her grey head, "I know your
                     own babies will need it."</p>
                  <p>"Then, Martha, we will have to trust in God. I can't rob those little negro
                     children of their only chance for life. My own may never need it." A groan
                     escaped Louise's pale lips.</p>
                  <p>"Go," continued Louise, waving her hand to the faithful slave, "give the
                     medicine as I ordered it."</p>
                  <p>Louise bent again over her infants.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lucia! I would almost give my life for one piece of ice to cool my poor
                     baby's head. See how hot it is! how he suffers! My child, my little, little wee
                     ones!"</p>
                  <p>Oh, God! the sorrow of this night! The babies are dead;—sweet Amenaide, bright
                     little Philip!</p>
                  <p>I have just aided Louise to dress the pure forms of clay, and have covered them
                     with wild flowers, verbenas, and long fern leaves. Oh, how lovely, how lovely
                     they look as they lie there! My poor Louise, my poor Louise, she does not shed
                     a tear! She moves like an automaton, or a woman of stone; she gives every
                     necessary order in a cold, constrained, clear voice, that rings sharply on the
                     ear. It makes me put my fingers in my ears to hear her speak—there is such
                     piercing heart-break in her voice. Not a word, not a word of natural grief out
                     of those compressed lips! It is an eagle stricken to the heart.</p>
                  <p>We have no <emph>coffins</emph> for the little ones—no means of procuring one
                     in this trackless wilderness! Louise, with her own hands, has wrapped the fine
                     linen sheet about her precious children; sewed it firmly around them. Then she
                     took a white satin skirt of a dress of her's, ripped it from the waist, and
                     made a shroud, and folded it over them; then a costly shawl, then a soft
                     blanket over all.</p>
                  <p>The children were laid on their sides with their arms clasped about each other!
                     Louise took her prayer-hook, some holy water, and a gold crucifix,—motioned the
                     negroes to follow with her children's bodies. The negroes all crowded about
                     her; they wept bitterly; they had lined the grave with fine foliage and soft
                     ferns. The little bodies were laid down tenderly. Louise placed the crucifix
                     upon them; she sprinkled the holy water abundantly over them. She took up her
                     manual to read, but it was too much; the book dropped from her hand. "Oh, God!
                     I cannot! I cannot!"</p>
                  <p>I caught her as she fell forward heavily, insensible, in my arms. The negroes
                     filled the grave, while we carried Louise back to the empty, noiseless
                     tent.</p>

                  <p>THE war progressed,—event crowding upon event. The whole South assumed the
                     appearance of one vast camp. In the cities, however, there still moved some
                     semblance of the courtesies and amenities of civil and social life. Though the
                     lovers of pleasure were so much abashed by the stern gloom which had settled in
                     a dense leaden cloud above the whole land south of Mason's and Dixon's—yet they
                     were decent enough to make a pretext of patriotism; and therefore sung, danced,
                     acted, and whirled for the sake of "<emph>the soldiers.</emph>" Tableaux and
                     charade parties were popular. It added a sparkle to the most brilliant eye, to
                     know it was shining so dazzlingly, and that all beauty was useful, to make
                     money for the Confederates. Fair women put themselves in pose, and allowed the
                     admiring glance of thousands to rest upon their delicate faces, under these
                     circumstances, who would otherwise have been as coy of lifting their veils as
                     any "lights of the Harem."</p>
                  <p>A large tablean party was gathered one evening at the house of the celebrated
                     Mrs. W——, the leader of the bon ton, in Richmond. The company was very select,
                     though numerous, including all the distinguished people, men or women, military
                     or civil, who happened to be in Richmond at that epoch.</p>
                  <p>The curtain had fallen on several beautiful groups, of which the spectators had
                     expressed their ardent admiration, by most rapturous applause. Now to the sound
                     of soft music it rose once more. An exclamation of unfeigned delight burst from
                     every lip. In truth, it was a lovely picture. The Greek Helen sat in a graceful
                     sort of chair, painted white to simulate ivory. It was perfect; every minute
                     detail had been accurately arranged. She sat—truly a world's wonder—with her
                     long "fair hair" rolling a golden flood of waves to her knees,—, modelled after
                     an antique statue; her dress of blue and gold, with a slight oriental dash of
                     crimson and pea-green in the heavy borders of the robe and peplum fell
                     gracefully about her. One exquisite sandalled foot, white as snow, was visible,
                     nestled in a dark green velvet footstool. The carpet spread below was deep
                     garnet in color. The white arms bare to the shoulder, moulded in loveliness,
                     were slightly elevated, as Helen drew the thread of purple wool from off her
                     gilded distaff. The face was rarely, rarely beautiful—form, sculpture of
                     feature, complexion, color, was unsurpassable but on the smooth white brow, on
                     the tinted cheek, on the perfect curve of the lips, in the lustrous blue eyes,
                     there lurked a strange, indefinable expression, which impressed one peculiarly.
                     It was not the less beautiful for this, that face. It was more truly

                  <p>Near her knelt a little girl three years of age, whose strong resemblance to
                     the "spartan queen" showed close relationship between them. This lovely child
                     held up a basket of freshest roses, which she seemed to be proffering to
                     Helen.</p>
                  <p>Audible whispers ran around the circle of enraptured spectators—</p>
                  <p>"Who is it?"</p>
                  <p>"Madame Rozanne, and her little daughter Vadine, newly arrived from the
                     South."</p>
                  <p>"A blonde creole, the most exquisite beauty in the world, you know!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, very rich, apparently, very charming and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                     favor; violently Southern, of course."</p>
                  <p>The curtain dropped amidst vehement clapping of hands and cries of
                     "Encore!"</p>
                  <p>Madame Rozanne had made her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">début</foreign> in Richmond
                     only a few weeks previous to the tableau party. She was utterly unknown in the
                     city, but she brought valuable letters, which furnished her with an excellent
                     visiting circle. She seemed to have plenty of money, rented a handsome house,
                     was open and ardent in expression of her devotion to the Southern cause, was
                     very beautiful, kept a good cook, good wines, and gave good dinners. Her
                     manners were those of one accustomed to society; she was voted "charming," took
                     rank immediately as a reigning belle, and was a special divinity among the
                     military stars who crowded around her with most obsequious homage. She soon put
                     herself en rapport with the "chiefs," and exhibited, they said, "extraordinary
                     good sense in her conversations and pertinent questionings on military
                     matters."</p>
                  <p>It added something to her attractions that Madame Rozanne was rather given to
                     feminine caprices,—had mégrims and "headaches," and oftentimes obscured herself
                     entirely from her crowd of adorers for a week or more, when she would be
                     obstinately invisible, and the perpetually reiterated "not at home" jarred
                     painfully on eagerly expectant hearts; but the world forgave everything, and
                     "in secret owned resistless beauty's power."</p>
                  <p>About this time it was discovered that the plans of the Confederate leaders
                     were frequently known to and thwarted by their enemies. In the most mysterious
                     manner information of important and carefully guarded movements seemed to be
                     communicated to the Federals. Every means was employed to discover the traitor
                     in the camp—the spy—but with no success. Detectives were occupied day and night
                     in the service, careful inquisition made into the habits of households supposed
                     to have opportunities of obtaining information, but 'twas all vain. Madame
                     Rozanne, the queen of fashion and beauty, troubled her lovely head very little
                     about such matters; she was so eager and frank in her love for the South. She
                     did not seem to be well acquainted in Louisiana, but she explained that point
                     very gracefully by her frequent allusions to her long absence—her education
                     abroad. She had been sent early to school in Paris, as was so much the custom
                     of Louisiana creole parents; there she had remained upon her marriage, and had
                     returned "home" only just as the war broke out, being left suddenly a widow
                     with one little child. The blockade was in full rigor, the Southerners had
                     little intercourse with the outside world, nobody arose to dispute Madame
                     Rozanne's story, and so "it went."</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, however, at the period of Madame's capricious retirements, when the
                     little Vadine might be seen playing in the pretty garden belonging to Madame's
                     half suburban residence, there might also have been seen driving rapidly in the
                     vicinage of the pickets an ambulance with closely buttoned curtains, in which
                     reclined a lady whose features, in spite of black eyebrows, raven hair, and
                     brownish-tinged skin, bore a singular resemblance to the famous beauty of
                     Richmond; but this person was clothed in the garb of a Béguine,—a close white
                     coif and guimpe, a coarse brown serge gown, which had a trick of falling into
                     the graceful folds of "<emph>Helen's</emph>" robe; the long brown veil over
                     all, subduing the flash, of deep blue eyes; the small white hands, buried in
                     the large, full, drooping sleeve, wooden beads, and a heavy crucifix, completed
                     the costume. "<emph>Sister Euphrasie</emph>" was well known in the Southern
                     hospitals, in the camps, and at head-quarters. Those lovely azure eyes had been
                     suffused with tears often over the wounds of Southern braves; the white hands
                     frequently ministered to the needs of the suffering, dying soldier. Some women
                     have a <emph>facility</emph> of weeping at will. All tears are not of sorrow.
                     "Sister Euphrasie" was often entrusted with <emph>valuable documents,</emph>
                     and knew everything that was going on generally in Secessia!</p>

                  <p>It was in 1862 Prince Roskopff died so suddenly in Paris, leaving Grace a widow
                     with one child, a daughter of three years. As he left no will, and girls could
                     not inherit in his household, his vast estate in Russia escheated to the crown.
                     The Czar was not disposed to be particularly liberal to Roskopff's American
                     wife, so a very small stipend was allowed to the Princess Roskopff and her
                     daughter. Thérese Vadine. Grace found she could not remain in<pb n="110-111"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000056"/> Paris on such limited means, so she returned
                     reluctantly to America, where she met slender welcome from distant relatives
                     who cared not to be burdened with the extravagances of an almost pauperized
                     Russian princess. Grace had lived so long abroad that she cared but little for
                     any portion of America. She had no sense of patriotism; she loved Paris, and
                     its gayeties; she sighed over the loss of her accustomed pleasures,—like Marie
                     Stuart, she extended her arms longingly as the shores of France disappeared
                     from her strained eyes; but, being in Washington City, and thrown into
                     intercourse with leading politicians, who soon discovered her wit, her
                     sprightliness, her case of manner, her wondrous beauty, she was induced to
                     hearken to suggestions which flattered her vanity, awakened her ambition, and
                     roused any latent feeling of national pride left in her, besides she was
                     promised supplies, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad libitum,</foreign> of money and
                     pleasure, and she set her tiny white teeth together and ground the delicate
                     pearl edges as she remembered Reginald Laurie, and her vow of vengeance on him
                     and his. The beautiful white brow gathered black shadows as she thought of
                     Louise Peyrault and all her insolence.</p>

                  <p>General Burmah " out Butlered Butler," in his tyranny, violence and corruption.
                     "Military necessity" was made the plea of the most flagrant outrages on the
                     citizens. Men, women and children were thrust into filthy jails on the
                     slightest pretexts, without examination, upon unknown accusations, and kept
                     there until friends could bribe them out of the wretched dungeons. Of course
                     the most eminent, the most virtuous, the most conspicuous citizens were struck
                     down first. It was easy to get up cases against anybody. Certainly the people,
                     with one or two well recognized exceptions, were all Secessionists, and having
                     sons and fathers and husbands in the Confederate army, would naturally run any
                     risk to aid or receive intelligence from their beloved ones. Shut up in the
                     lines, the captive people lived a wretched, agonized life, trembling at the
                     rumor of every battle, cut off entirely from communication, their sons without.
                     Mothers sunk often senseless in the streets, at the whisper, borne by invisible
                     and unknown winds, which said their darlings had fallen on the field of the
                     dead, and would see their faces no more forever. Mr. Laurie's family were very
                     distinguished as well as wealthy people. Mr. Laurie suffered par conséquence.
                     The old mansion was filled with gems of art and virtu. It was said that the
                     picture gallery alone was worth two hundred thousand dollars—perhaps it was. It
                     was a good haul for General Burmah. Accusation was brought against Mr. Laurie
                     of aiding the Confederates. In spite of his age and blindness he was cast into
                     prison, and kept there twelve weeks. After some delay Annie was permitted to
                     visit him. The old man was very gentle and very patient. Stripped of all usual
                     resources, with abandoned plantations, and money in bank all confiscated, Annie
                     found it very difficult to procure even the provisions necessary to sustain
                     life for Margaret, Miss Smith, her aged father and herself. Mr. Laurie could
                     not eat the coarse prison fare—he tried to do so—he never complained, only grew
                     weaker, whiter, and more gentle every day. Annie stripped the diamonds from her
                     fingers, sold all the jewelry at the greatest sacrifices—sold clothing, fine
                     dresses, laces, articles of furniture. So she kept her family alive; she would
                     not apply for "Yankee rations." They had not even the comfort of visits from
                     Professor Leibermann; he was beyond the lines, and could not get passes to come
                     in though his German citizenship protected him personally. All the servants had
                     deserted the Lauries except old Betsy, and she was too feeble to do much. Even
                     Jenny was gone—enticed away by vanity and curiosity; Margaret wept bitterly
                     over Jenny's detection. The three women, Miss Smith, Margaret, and Annie, did
                     all their own work. Miss Smith was so corpulent that Annie would only let her
                     do light tasks, and Margaret was young, a heavy sleeper; so Annie would
                     generally rise early, and, without awakening any one, accomplish nearly all
                     that had to be done. In vain Miss Smith and Margaret expostulated. Margaret
                     would try her utmost to forestal her aunt, but the beautiful, snow-white lids
                     were hard to unclose, and the ineffectual struggle to get up "before Aunt
                     Annie" was renewed conscientiously every morning. Then Margaret was rather
                     awkward about manual labor; she burned her fingers with the tea-kettle and
                     mashed them with the rolling-pin, and made great blisters all over her hands
                     trying to wash the clothes. Annie's delicate, transparent, rice-paper hands
                     could accomplish tenfold as much, quietly, noiselessly and perfectly. But soon
                     they were forced to encounter more trials than these. General Burmah quartered
                     two regiments of negro troops in the grounds, principally upon the lawn
                     immediately about the house. The sutler's tent, and the tents of the
                     laundresses, unprincipled negresses, were located just before the front door of
                     the house. The three helpless, unprotected women were in despair. Annie Laurie
                     was then sent for by the officer in command, and the use of the lower and
                     principal rooms was demanded. Annie withdrew, with Miss Smith, Margaret and old
                     Betsy, on to the floor above. She closed all the front windows—the insulting
                     and degrading scenes necessarily forced into view, on that side, were beyond
                     endurance. It was with trembling heart Annie Laurie quitted Margaret and Miss
                     Smith every day, when she went to minister to her imprisoned father.</p>
                  <p>One morning, whilst she was absent on this mission, Miss Smith and Margaret
                     were sitting together, too sad even to attempt to converse, when there came a
                     violent rapping on the door, which they always kept prudently locked. Margaret
                     hastened to the door; she found, standing outside of it, a little negro boy
                     about twelve years old, a grandson of Betsy's, who, in former times, had been a
                     great pet of Lucian Courtenay's. The boy's eyes were wide with horror and his
                     mouth open.</p>
                  <p>"What is it, Tom?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! Miss Margaret, Mars Lucian is done gone—got killed out yonder by
                     Marshall's field. 'The rebs' and the Yanks done had a fight."</p>
                  <p>A cry from Miss Smith showed she had heard the fearful intelligence. Margaret
                     turned quickly—almost fiercely towards her, every feature set and blanched with
                     agony—"Hush!" she whispered, hoarsely, "hush!" Then pressing one hand
                     powerfully on her heart, and catching at the handle of the door to steady
                     herself, for she swayed and tottered as if she must fall, she drew a long, long
                     breath, closed her eyes for an instant, then spoke clearly:</p>
                  <p>"Was he dead when you left?"</p>
                  <p>"Mos—dead—the blood spirting out every whar! He was down in the dust in the
                     middle of the road."</p>
                  <p>"Brandy, Miss Smith! Is there not a drop in the house?" exclaimed Margaret.</p>
                  <p>"Here, Margaret, here's a little left in this bottle," sobbed the overpowered
                     Miss Smith.</p>
                  <p>Margaret snatched the bottle hastily from Miss Smith's hand, seized a towel
                     from a rack, took up a sun-bonnet and tied it on her head.</p>
                  <p>"Tom, did you ride here?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Marm."</p>
                  <p>"Where's your horse?"</p>
                  <p>"Tied in the woods, back of the garden."</p>
                  <p>"Come, show me the way. Miss Smith, good-bye, I am going to Lucian."</p>
                  <p>Miss Smith sank down helplessly with a groan.</p>
                  <p>Margaret ran out of the room, Tom following her.</p>
                  <p>There had been a sharp skirmish that morning between a band of Federal and
                     Confederate scouts. The Federals got the best of it. The Confederates were
                     forced to retreat. Lucian Courtenay, commanding his company, fell, shot through
                     the lungs. His companions, forced back by superior numbers, were not able to
                     bear him off. He was lying, as Tom said, in the middle of the road, the blood
                     pouring out from his wound at every respiration. The Federals were grouped
                     around him: recognizing him as an officer, an ambulance had been sent for to
                     convey him to a building where they had a hospital.</p>
                  <p>Lucian had been lying a half hour in this condition. He felt himself
                     sinking—dying. He was nearly swooning—scarcely conscious. He did not hear the
                     sound of horses' hoofs urged at full speed, which came flying down the road
                     leading into Natchez. He did not see the surprise—hear the exclamations of the
                     Federals, as the sweating steed rushed into their midst, and the beautiful fair
                     woman sprang from it, hurling the reins from one hand. She rushed, without a
                     word, to the sinking and bleeding Confederate, seating herself on the earth,
                     down in the dust. She lifted Lucian's head in her arms, she put the brandy to
                     his lips, he swallowed a small portion—it revived him—he opened his eyes.
                     Margaret threw off her bonnet.</p>
                  <p>"It is I, Margaret—Lucian! <emph>Your</emph> Margaret!"</p>
                  <p>A smile broke over Lucian's face. He recognized her. Moving his arms feebly, he
                     clasped them around her waist, as his head lay on her lap.</p>
                  <p>Margaret took the towels, she passed them around his body; she put a hand on
                     the orifice of the wound, and held it firmly; the blood ceased to pour out so
                     fast. But Lucian was fainting away.</p>
                  <p>"For God's sake," exclaimed Margaret, speaking to the Federals who stood
                     watching the scene in dumb surprise, "for God's sake, put some water in this
                     brandy and help me to give it to him. Some of you may have friends elsewhere in
                     this condition, or may be soon so yourselves: show a little pity now if you
                     hope for any."</p>
                  <p>"I'm d—d if I don't," said a rough Irish soldier; "by St. Patrick, honey, but
                     I'll help all you I can."</p>
                  <p>The man took up the bottle from Margaret's side and put some water into it from
                     his canteen, and aided Margaret to pour it, from time to time, into Lucian's
                     pale lips. The other Federals stood around in silence, though more than one
                     rough man wiped his eyes with the back of his hand, and tried to whistle as he
                     looked at the affecting group. They all thought the handsome rebel was dying.
                     He was lying now with his eyes closed—an expression of satisfied content upon
                     his pallid face, his hands still locked around Margaret's waist. She sat
                     holding him, her eyes fixed on him—perfect love and agony written on every
                     beautiful feature. The hot sun streamed over<pb n="112-113"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000057"/> her, on her golden bronze wreaths of hair,
                     making them glitter over her lovely shoulders—scorching, burning her! She did
                     not feel it; she was conscious of nothing but Lucian—Lucian dying in her
                     arms!</p>
                  <p>The ambulance came at last. Lucian was lifted in. Margaret walked bareheaded by
                     the side of the wagon. The compassionate Irishman picked up her sun-bonnet and
                     placed it on her head. Margaret tied it mechanically; she looked up in the
                     man's face with a dazed, bewildered glance.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, holy St. Patrick! Surely the childer is crazed with the grief," said
                     Pat.</p>
                  <p>But when the jolting of the ambulance would sometimes force a low moan of pain
                     from the almost insensible Lucian, the quick, responsive shudder which ran over
                     Margaret's face and figure, showed she was sensible at least to his
                     sufferings.</p>
                  <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>It was the evening of the third day since Lucian had received his wound. He lay
                     still faint, weak, sunk in the feebleness of exhaustion, scarcely able to
                     unclose his eyes; his hands stretched out helplessly, he seemed even now half
                     dead. The only sign of consciousness he gave was his faint smile, whenever
                     Margaret bent over or spoke to him. He would swallow instantly and
                     unresistingly whatever she put to his lips. Sometimes with a great effort he
                     would open his eyes and fix them on her beautiful, agonized face as she would
                     lean above him to smooth his pillow or arrange a bandage.</p>
                  <p>The surgeon had forbidden his speaking. Margaret knelt by him, and lifted the
                     dark, heavy locks from his forehead, moistened with the perspiration of
                     excessive debility. Lucian moved one hand feebly along the couch till it rested
                     on Margaret's arm; he tried to clasp it with his fingers, but was too weak.
                     Margaret lifted the poor, nerveless hand, and bending nearer, laid it round her
                     neck and rested her head on the pillow beside the apparently dying man's.
                     Lucian turned his head till his lips touched her soft cheek, and whispered so
                     low that only love could have heard it.</p>
                  <p>"My darling! my darling!"</p>
                  <p>And the once haughty, queen-like, proud, cold Margaret knelt by her wounded
                     lover, clinging, weeping, tender as when a little child. The door opened
                     softly. Margaret did not move. She was past pride—past all thought or care for
                     human eyes or gossip. She was going down, she felt, into the valley of the
                     shadow of death, with her beloved. But it was a familiar hand which laid itself
                     on her bowed head, and a well-known voice which ejaculated in the pity of the
                     moment in his native German.</p>
                  <p>"Ach, Gott! ach, Gott! meines kindern!"</p>
                  <p>Professor Liebermann put his fingers on Lucian's pulse, counted it carefully,
                     anxiously. Margaret stretched out her hand to him, in silence, still not
                     lifting her head from the pillow. The old professor blew his nose and wiped
                     away vigorously the tears which would course down his cheeks in spite of his
                     manly effort to stay them.</p>
                  <p>Lucian tried to speak. Margaret raised her head, and the professor bent over
                     him to hear.</p>
                  <p>"Stimulant," whispered Lucian.</p>
                  <p>Margaret, gave him a spoonful of weak cordial, prepared by the surgeon.</p>
                  <p>"More," whispered Lucian.</p>
                  <p>She gave him more. Then, with a great effort, Lucian opened his eyes and fixed
                     them full upon the professor.</p>
                  <p>"I think—shall die—Margaret—be my wife—first!"</p>
                  <p>The professor started. Margaret heard the words, and put her hand into
                     Lucian's, saying firmly, with something of her former imperiousness:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes! if you desire it, Lucian!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian clasped her hand close, and still gazed imploringly into the professor's
                     face. That impulsive scholar surveyed the two earnestly; he recognized the
                     peculiarity of Margaret's position. Yes, it was better, even if Lucian survived
                     but a day, it <emph>was</emph> better Margaret should be his wife,—and his
                     heart yearned over the young people! They were both so dear to him. He had
                     received a hurried pencil note from Miss Smith, conveyed safely to his hands by
                     the boy Tom, entreating him to seek for Lucian and Margaret. It had been
                     written immediately after Margaret's hasty flight, but Tom had not been able to
                     accomplish the getting through the lines until two days after, when the
                     professor had started out instantly in pursuit of those he called his
                     "kindern." The professor mopped his heated brow with his red silk
                     pocket-handkerchief—</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, children. Well, if we must have it so,—but ach! meine Gott, what
                     will Mr. Laurie and Annie say?"</p>
                  <p>A shiver ran over Margaret at the mention of those beloved names. Then kneeling
                     down again and laying her golden head close to Lucian's dark curls, she
                     murmured—</p>
                  <p>"Oh, he is dearer than all! dearer than all!"</p>
                  <p>Lucian smiled proudly, joyfully—</p>
                  <p>"You, see, she consents, dear friend—pity, both."</p>
                  <p>The professor sprang up quickly, and walked hastily up and down the room. At
                     last he stopped and approached the bed—</p>
                  <p>"Meine Gott! I am not stone, neider ice! It shall be! I will go now to seek the
                     priest—the clergyman, and the license we will get afterwards."</p>
                  <p>Picking up his hat, he rushed out of the room in his usual impetuous manner. No
                     sound disturbed the profound silence of the room where the two heads, one so
                     dark, the other so bright, rested on the same pillow, pressed down by the
                     heavy, heavy weight of hopeless love and sorrow.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before the professor returned, accompanied by a clergyman, in
                     his white surplice; the surgeon of the hospital, and four other persons, men of
                     consideration in the community, what the professor called "house-fathers," whom
                     he had hurriedly summoned to act as witnesses to this hasty marriage.</p>
                  <p>Lucian spoke, with effort, but loud enough for all to hear—</p>
                  <p>"My first Christian name is <emph>Gerald.</emph> I would prefer being married
                     by that name; you do not mind, Margaret?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no!" exclaimed Margaret, "not if you prefer it."</p>
                  <p>Opening his prayer-book, the clergyman proceeded with the ceremony—the solemn
                     vows were exchanged, and "Gerald and Margaret" were declared man and wife in
                     the sight of God and man.</p>
                  <p>Lucian seemed to gather new strength as the ceremony progressed. At the close
                     he lay with his wife's hand clasped fast in his. The Yankee surgeon had taken
                     off his own engagement ring and given it as the marriage ring. Lucian held
                     Margaret's hand fast, then signed with the other for the clergyman and
                     witnesses to draw nearer. They obeyed the feeble signal! Closing his eyes an
                     instant—drawing a long inspiration, Lucian opened his eyes and fixed them fully
                     on the faces of the professor and the clergyman, and said clearly and
                     distinctly:</p>
                  <p>"I am Gerald Vail Dare, the only son of Sir Hugh Dare, Baron of Hurst,
                     Cornwall, England. This is my wife, Margaret Dare; this is my dying
                     attestation—write it down, and send copy to Lord Lyons, Washington city."</p>
                  <p>If a bombshell had exploded in their midst, there could not have been a more
                     astonished group than that formed at this moment by the professor, the
                     clergyman, the surgeon, and the four respectable witnesses!</p>
                  <p>"Ach! Gott!" ejaculated the professor; but whatever sensations might have been
                     experienced by the stunned group, all feeling was quickly merged into one of
                     fright and anxiety, as a scream from Margaret announced the fact, that Lucian,
                     or Gerald had fainted dead away—and that the blood was welling again from the
                     wound, reöpened by the effort of speaking, and the violent emotion he had
                     experienced. For a few moments all was bustle and confusion. But at last the
                     surgeon succeeded in stopping the flow of blood and restored Lucian to
                     sensibility. Then he incontinently turned every body out of the patient's room,
                     except the young wife—making even the professor station himself in an adjoining
                     apartment—the only possible, not probable hope of saving the young man, he knew
                     lay in absolute, entire quiet and repose: The professor begged to be supplied
                     with paper and pens, and occupied himself in writing a full and minute detail,
                     half English and half German (for whenever he became very sentimental or
                     tender, he always retreated to his Teutonic fastnesses), of the events which
                     had just transpired. This wondrous epistle he succeeded in getting to Miss
                     Smith, by the hands of the ubiquitous Tom, who managed to creep into the
                     guarded city by means of the numerous bayous and forests.</p>
                  <p>Then came a long monotony in the existence of these three persons. Gerald, as
                     we must now call him, did not die; Margaret nursed him too faithfully; watched
                     him too closely; loved him too tenderly. GOD spared him to her. But days glided
                     into weeks, and weeks into months, and still the wounded soldier lay there, his
                     wife watching him, and the professor watching both of them, from his post in
                     the adjoining room. Gerald was slowly rallying; he had gotten so far that he
                     could sit up a little and even walk feebly across the room, supported by his
                     wife and his old friend. As soon as he could bear the effort of narration, he
                     told these two his whole history. Margaret learned who her husband was, and
                     recognized the connection between his and her branch of the Vails. Gerald would
                     talk now by the hour of his sister, and even of his father, with a sad, proud,
                     longing feeling. Margaret had written piteous, loving letters to her
                     grandfather, her Aunt Annie, and to Miss Smith. Startled and shocked as these
                     all were by the hasty, inconsequent marriage—these important personages had
                     forgiven the young couple, and Mr. Laurie sent them his tenderest blessing from
                     out of his dreary prison, with which Annie Laurie was very well pleased—she
                     loved them both so much, and after a few reproachful sentences to the professor
                     and to the other dramatis personæ, which she considered as a necessary homage
                     to propriety. Miss Smith's joy fairly overflowed. Annie couldn't leave her
                     father; but Miss Smith, the grand, the magnificent, the decorous, the precisely
                     proper, walked and scrambled, and climbed, and waded, puffed and panted, half a
                     night through the bayous, following the jack-o'-lantern, Tom, both laded with
                     bundles of clothing and medicines, in risk of capture, and dure imprisonment,
                     until they found themselves six miles beyond the Federal lines, and Miss Smith
                     communicating with the professor; by the kindness of the sympathizng surgeon,
                     procured admittance to the room of the wounded prisoner, and had the
                     satisfaction of clasping her "blessed children" (that's what she called
                        them)<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6308-00000058"/> once more to her capacious
                     bosom. She established herself now in the neighborhood, visited the hospital
                     every day, and mounted guard with the professor. The intelligent surgeon often
                     joined the family party. Margaret's color and her smiles began to come back to
                     her blanched, anxious countenance. Really, these two hadn't such a disagreeable
                     honey-moon after all, though it was in a prison. Margaret found it hard work to
                     substitute "Gerald" for Lucian; but she accomplished it at last, and it was
                     with a very proud flourish that she made the tail of the D in her signature to
                     her notes to her Aunt Annie, and grandfather, when she signed herself "Margaret
                     Vail Dare."</p>
                  <p>Gerald lived only in the light of her eyes; he could not bear his wife out of
                     his sight even for a moment; his heart softened; he yearned to exhibit his
                     beautiful, stately wife, and to see his stern father's hand in blessing on her
                     radiant head. That alas! could never, never be in this world; but Gerald did
                     not know that sorrowful fact.</p>
                  <p>Gerald talked incessantly of England. As soon as he was capable of bearing the
                     fatigue, an order came for his removal to the prison for officers, on Johnson's
                     Island. Margaret wrote a few hurried lines of farewell to her grandfather and
                     aunt then set out with Miss Smith and the professor, to follow Gerald. She
                     procured lodging opposite Johnson's Island, on the Canadian shore, where she
                     remained with her faithful companions, receiving rarely a permit to visit her
                     husband. Every visit cost her a trip to Washington, where, through the powerful
                     influence of the British minister, she procured the anxiously coveted favor.
                     Gerald studied and whiled away the dreary hours as well as he could; but it was
                     a great satisfaction to remember the ceaseless, watchful love that he knew ever
                     encompassed him. So he kept up a brave heart, and hoped on—looking over every
                     day when he was allowed to take exercise at the Canadian shore, where his
                     "family" lived.</p>

                  <head type="sub">GENERAL BURMAH.</head>
                  <p>GENERAL BURMAH had not the honor of drawing his first breath of life in the
                     purified atmosphere of New England, a disadvantage which he felt seriously, and
                     therefore tried to repair by enthusiastic imitation of an ideal "Yankee,"—an
                     imitation which did not render him the more attractive to the people he had
                     absolute power over, who hate shams, and like real Yankees better than spurious
                     ones, but unfortunately have no especial cause for devotion to either.</p>
                  <p>The fortune of war had put Natchez under his feet. Voe victis! it was. War
                     edicts are not written in rose-color anywhere, but in blood, in captured cities
                     usually. He was a tall, tank, grey-haired man, with thin, narrow visage,
                     greedy, twinkling, dull eyes, and a sensual mouth, which he strove in vain to
                     draw down sanctimoniously at the corners. Instead of giving him a saintly
                     expression, his efforts only produced a hypocritical aspect. He was much given
                     to religion, frequented "meeting," held family prayers regularly, having
                        <emph>the gift</emph> of extemporaneous reminders and impertinent
                     counsellings of the Almighty, which is valued by some religionists who fancy
                     they can give the Lord good advice, or that he, like Baal, "sleeps sometimes,
                     and can be roused by much speaking." He liked "prayer meetings," in the
                     consciousness of his flux verbarum, and never lost an opportunity of
                     administering wholesome, prosy, and very prolonged counsel to all the
                     distressed women who were forced by necessity to seek his presence. If they
                     were pretty, he added to his fatherly counsel a lover-like embrance, which some
                     indignantly resented, others, frightened, tamely submitted to. The man's
                     character was well known to all. One of his favorite employments, when not
                     trading in cotton, smuggling arms, &amp;c., to the Confederates, or receiving
                     bribes from them, was reading "Evangeline" to foolish girls, or
                     not-too-well-spoken-of young widows. It was a singular fact that many of the
                     Federal officers who came South felt it incumbent to fetch with them a copy of
                     Mr. Longfellow's very pretty poem as well as their munitions of war! Perhaps
                     they desired to compare his descriptions with the reality. If so, they found
                     that, with the clairvoyance of genius, he had given a good though
                     conventionalized generalization of the "land of lilies"; but as for "the hedges
                     of blooming roses" around "the sylvan islands," unless Evangeline went out of
                     the Atchafalaya, high up on the prairies on the second bottom land on Turkey
                     Creek or Bayou Maçon, she probably did not see as many <emph>roses</emph> as
                     Mr. Longfellow thinks she did. No roses love marshy lands. The rosa cannina of
                     Louisiana grows only on the hills. The Cherokee rose is planted and cultivated;
                     probably was not very extensively so in 1775, about the time the Acadians were
                     turned out of their early homes by the English. The only rosacae that grow wild
                     on the rivers of Louisiana are dew and blackberries; but the "myriad lilies"
                     are all right. Anybody can see them as well as Evangeline.</p>
                  <p>But if one wants to see the lily realm in perfection he must take a jaunt, in
                     the month of July, on the Jackson and New Orleans railroad. Then, if his eyes
                     can gaze on so much beauty undazzled, he will see the water-queen in fullest
                     glory. The blessed eyes of <emph>Riquetti</emph> himself,—he who was privileged
                     to behold and to paint the portraits of eight hundred sorts of lilies,—never
                     looked on anything more splendid. Acres and acres, oh, <emph>miles</emph> of
                     flowers, erect their stately, perfumed heads on every side, and one is borne at
                     lightning speed through the heavily-fragrant air; the blossoms shivering
                     tremulously and nodding a greeting as the locomotive rushes on through the
                     "quaking prairies." No, Mr. Longfellow is mistaken. The rose may queen it
                     elsewhere, but in Louisiana the lily retains her ancient, rightful heritage,
                     and the mockingbird sings about <emph>her,</emph> and nightingales are
                     silent.</p>
                  <p>One has to sweeten one's memory when one has to think of General Burmah, and
                     one wishes to say as little of him as is possible with the absolute needs of
                     history. "Oh, for an ounce of civet!" General Burmah used these golden verses
                     as an entering wedge into the silly girls' hearts. Alas! there were some who,
                     betrayed by vanity, forgot friends and blood and country, and stooped to
                     listen.</p>
                  <p>But not among these was Annie Laurie. When General Burmah ordered her into his
                     presence,—for she was fair to look upon,—she stood always at the extreme end of
                     the very long table, firmly and haughtily, until his catechism, or lecture, or
                     sermon, was ended. Then she would reply in as few words as possible, and
                     request her dismissal. Her old father was still in prison, in the power of this
                     man, so she folded her arms firmly to keep down her struggling spirit, and
                     spoke him as respectfully as she could. The alabaster lamp used to blaze high
                     on such occasions, but with a sort of lurid glare that gave a red sparkle to
                     the changeful violet eye, and almost made it tawny.</p>
                  <p>Tom had brought Annie Laurie the epistles of Margaret, Miss Smith, and
                     Professor Liebermann safely through the lines, which had been recently
                     contracted, throwing Gerald's prison beyond; but he was not expected to live,
                     and had given his parole not to escape until he was able to go to Johnson's
                     Island. So he and his small coterie of adorers and nurses remained quietly
                     where they were, visited daily by the Federal surgeon, who had taken a fancy to
                     the whole party, and was doing his utmost to save General. The hospital was too
                     near the lines for open visits from Confederates,—this was previous to Gerald's
                     removal to Johnson's Island. Once when Annie Laurie was walking towards her now
                     lonely home, after leaving her father's prison, in the dim twilight, some
                     unknown hand slipped into her's a letter from Harold. It was done so hastily
                     and furtively that Annie knew not who to thank for her treasure. She grasped it
                     tightly and hurried down the crowded street. She nearly ran over the remaining
                     two miles; she never halted in her rapid course until she found herself almost
                     breathless in her own apartment. Throwing herself on a sofa she covered the
                     insensible paper with kisses.</p>
                  <p>Two days after she was summoned to Burmah's presence.</p>
                  <p>"So, so, young lady, it is impossible to teach you Rebel women a lesson of
                     discretion. I find you have been communicating with the "Secesh" beyond the
                     lines. Do you know the punishment of a spy?" demanded the autocrat.</p>
                  <p>Annie held her head up haughtily.</p>
                  <p>"I know <emph>your</emph> punishment for what you chose to call 'a spy' is
                     death or imprisonment."</p>
                  <p>"What have you to say then?" asked Burmah. "Have you not received letters
                     constantly through the instrumentality of this colored boy?"</p>
                  <p>Ringing a bell, a door opened, and Tom was thrust forward by a guard. Tom's
                     face was very dirty as well as his ragged clothes, and his countenance was
                     streaked with teartraces. He looked wildly up at Burmah, then, rushing to Annie
                     Laurie and seizing the skirt of her dress, he exclaimed in a lamentable
                     tone:</p>
                  <p>"Please, Miss Annie, don't let'em hang me, please, ma'am. I ain't done
                     nuthin—nuthin at all."</p>
                  <p>Annie put her delicate white hand on the crying child's woolly head.</p>
                  <p>"I hope they won't harm a little child like you, Tom. I would die myself just
                     to prevent such brutality."</p>
                  <p>Burmah smiled grimly.</p>
                  <p>"Death is easy and sweet to a prepared Christian soul; but I fear you, Annie
                     Laurie, are walking swiftly down the broad road which leadeth only to
                     destruction!"</p>
                  <p>Annie smiled scornfully, but disdained to reply. Folding her arms quietly over
                     her breast, she simply said—</p>
                  <p>"General Burmah will be so good as to continue his inquisition. I can dispense
                     with theological discussion or instruction at his lips!"</p>
                  <p>Burmah flushed under the cool satirical smile—</p>
                  <p>"Girl, beware how you anger me! Do you acknowledge this hand-writing?" holding
                     up before her a letter to Margaret, which had been found on the unlucky Tom, as
                     he was endeavoring to creep through the lines with it.</p>
                  <p>"Yes! it is my hand-writing; and as you have already mastered its contents, you
                     are aware that it is only a family letter, not touching upon you, or your
                     government, in any particular. I have carefully refrained from writing a word
                     that could compromise any one—especially this poor faithful little negro
                     boy!"</p>
                  <p>Burmah laid the letter down.</p>
                  <p>"I certainly find nothing in this; but you<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000059"/> have kept up this correspondence some time, and
                     of course may have abused your opportunities."</p>
                  <p>"The letters could scarcely be regarded as being sent out of your lines,
                     General Burmah. The hospital is, or was, until very recently, within them, and
                     were all written to the wife of a paroled sick prisoner, in your own power.
                     They did not go into Confederate lines!"</p>
                  <p>"Sophistry. Do you mean to say, also, that a letter you were seen to receive
                     two days ago, whilst walking down Main Street, was from any person in my
                     lines?" Burmah looked at her keenly.</p>
                  <p>Annie's face paled, then flushed crimson. She stood mute.</p>
                  <p>"Where is that letter?" demanded Burmah. "Did you destroy it?"</p>
                  <p>Annie's moved lips faintly, but she was still silent.</p>
                  <p>"I <emph>know</emph> you have the letter still, that you have not destroyed it.
                     I have had you watched. Where is it?"</p>
                  <p>Annie stood silent.</p>
                  <p>"You can take time to decide whether you will surrender the letter, Miss
                     Laurie. If you do not very soon, it will be the worse for you;" and, added
                     Burmah, with a vindictive smile, "for that old rebel—your father."</p>
                  <p>Annie started, with a low cry of pain. Burmah had sent an arrow home there.</p>
                  <p>In an instant she drew Harold's letter from her bosom, where it had lain
                     concealed since she received it. Handing it to Burmah, she exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>"This is the letter, General Burmah. Don't torture my blind father!"</p>
                  <p>Burmah looked quickly, and with a gaze of insulting admiration at the flushed,
                     trembling woman, who stood quivering like a doe at bay before him.</p>
                  <p>Shudder after shudder thrilled over Annie Laurie, but she repressed all other
                     demonstrations of feeling, and his wicked, horrid glance brought a deeper flush
                     to her cheeks, and a brighter sparkle in her eyes. She flashed back a rapid
                     look of indignation, and her lip curled with involuntary loathing. Then she
                     rested one hand quietly on the end of the table, and threw her head back as she
                     drew herself up to her full stature.</p>
                  <p>Burmah opened the letter, examined it, and looked up with evident
                     annoyance.</p>
                  <p>Annie smiled.</p>
                  <p>"This letter is not English!"</p>
                  <p>"It is not—it is in Greek. I suppose you may possibly have an officer among you
                     who can translate it for you; if not, you can find some one in the city. Most
                     Southern men have collegiate educations, and retain some knowledge of their old
                     studies!"</p>
                  <p>"What are the contents of this letter, and who wrote it?"</p>
                  <p>"It is a love-letter, from the man whose wife I hope to be—some day! From Col.
                     Harold Ashton, of the Confederate army!"</p>
                  <p>"Why did he write in Greek?"</p>
                  <p>"He chose a language not generally used, one that we have studied together,
                     that he knew I could understand; as he was my master for years, and taught me
                     himself."</p>
                  <p>"What are these hieroglyphics at the close?"</p>
                  <p>"A warm and passionate quotation from the Persian poet Hafiz. You can find the
                     translation in Sir William Jones; here is the page and verse."</p>
                  <p>Annie seized a pencil and scrap of paper, scribbled the numbers of the page and
                     verse, and threw the paper back on the table.</p>
                  <p>Burmah folded the letter carefully, and laid it before him.</p>
                  <p>"Quite Abelardish. I will see if this is all true. In the meantime I warn you
                     that you will be watched, and severely treated, if you are found infringing the
                     rules of this Post again! The negro boy shall be put to work on the
                     fortifications. As for you," continued Burmah, rising and approaching her, "if
                     you were not so pretty, termagant as you are, you should find out the
                     conveniences of a cell in the common jail."</p>
                  <p>"General Burmah, I know <emph>it is</emph> a rule of war to prevent any
                     communication through the lines; but I tell you fairly, I will run almost any
                     risk to hear from—</p>
                  <p>"Your lover, pretty one!" said Burmah, rising up and standing by her. He
                     suddenly threw his arm around her and kissed her lips!</p>
                  <p>To lift her tiny doubled hand, to strike the dastard full in the face, and in
                     the confusion produced by the quick unexpected blow, to wrench herself free
                     from his hateful clasp, and spring out of the door, was the work of a moment
                     for the outraged woman! Her cheeks glowing, and eyes burning with indignant
                     wrath.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie now hastened down the short stairway into the street. Just as her
                     foot touched the pavement, a hand was laid on her shoulder, and she was
                     "arrested for insulting the flag," hurried off by two officials, and was thrust
                     into a large cell, used as a common prison, for the lowest class of persons,
                     either Confederate or Federal.</p>
                  <p>On this day there happened to be only about twenty men in this dirty apartment.
                     Among these the delicate girl was rudely pushed in.</p>
                  <p>For an instant terror blanched her face, as she looked about her in wonder and
                     fear; but recognizing the preponderance of grey coats, her hope rose.
                     Retreating to a corner, she sat down on a wooden stool, and covered her face
                     with her hands. The men stood off, gazing at her with looks of pity and
                     sympathy. At last, whispering together, they herded up in one end of the room,
                     and one of the Confederates stepping forward, said kindly—</p>
                  <p>"Don't be scared, young lady. We will take care of you as if you were our
                     sister!"</p>
                  <p>Annie raised her head; tears stood in her lovely eyes. Stretching out her hands
                     towards the men, she exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>"Thank you. I trust you!"</p>
                  <p>The man who had been spokesman, drew a slendor cord out of his pocket, tied one
                     end to a nail in each side of the wall. The room had been used as a clerk's
                     office, in the court house, and maps had once hung round it, and the nails or
                     hooks on which they had formerly hung were still remaining. Then the men took
                     one or two of the poor blankets allowed them and hung them so that they
                     curtained in the corner where Annie had cowered down. Taking off their worn
                     coats, the men spread them on the brick floor behind the curtain, and made a
                     soft if not very inviting pallet.</p>
                  <p>"Now, lady, that is all we can do; but you may feel safe here!"</p>
                  <p>Bowing respectfully, the men withdraw, leaving Annie in possession of this
                     corner. They went back to their own methods of wiling away the prison hours.
                     But while they played cards with greasy packs, or whittled rings out of gutta
                     percha, they talked in low tones or whispers. Not a base word or fierce sound
                     was uttered to disturb the imprisoned lady.</p>
                  <p>Poor Annie sunk down in despair upon the filthy pallet. She wrung her hands
                     when she thought of her poor, old blind father looking, longing for her daily
                     visit. Then, when she thought of Burmah, she almost started to her feet, and
                     clenched her hands in impotent rage. Harold, Reginald, Margaret—all, all,
                     rushed upon her thoughts, and she buried her head in the pile of rags, and
                     stifled groan after groan.</p>
                  <p>Late in the day, the turnkey came with the prisoners' food. He roughly pulled
                     aside the blanket screen, and put down on the floor by Annie the iron plate and
                     earthen jar containing the hard biscuit, small bit of beef and water allowed to
                     each person.</p>
                  <p>Annie was feverish; she took up the earthen jar and swallowed the uninviting
                     water eagerly,—but the food she could not touch. She pushed the iron plate
                     outside the blanket. It sat there undisturbed for some hours; then a tall,
                     thin, overgrown lad of nineteen approached timidly, saying—</p>
                  <p>"Ma'am, if you don't want that, may I have it?"</p>
                  <p>Annie looked at the hungry, wistful lad, compassionately—</p>
                  <p>"Take it, my poor fellow; I cannot eat!"</p>
                  <p>And the boy ate it ravenously. The boy then replaced the blanket torn down by
                     the rude turnkey, and retreated to the other end of the room.</p>
                  <p>Annie lay back on her pallet. She felt her brain growing confused and so hot.
                     She got alarmed. She had borne so much without shrinking! Was strength going to
                     fail her now, when she needed it so? The fever was coming on—on; her delicate
                     frame was taxed too far. She clasped her hands over her burning forehead, with
                     a low moan.</p>
                  <p>In an instant one of the confederate men stood on the other side of the
                     blanket—</p>
                  <p>"Is it anything we can do, Ma'am, to help you?" he asked. "Don't groan so!"</p>
                  <p>"No," replied Annie, feebly. "But I am going to be ill, I fear. God help
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Ma'am, I hope not. If I can only make noise enough to bring the turnkey,
                     so as to send for a doctor."</p>
                  <p>Rushing to the heavy door, the soldier put his mouth to the key-hole, and, in
                     defiance of the rules, shouted the Confederate war song, "Bonnie Blue Flag,"
                     until he heard hasty steps approaching, and the door being thrown open, the
                     angry turnkey seized him by the shirt collar, swung him around with a "d—n you!
                     Can't you keep less noise?"</p>
                  <p>"D—d if we all won't keep a yelling about your d—d Yankee ears, unless you send
                     a surgeon here to examine this young lady, who is sick there in the
                     corner."</p>
                  <p>The turnkey slung the man off from him, and approached Annie Laurie's pallet.
                     It needed but glance at her flushed face and wildly gleaming eyes, to see that
                     she was suffering with violent fever. The little transparent hands were tossed
                     out on the ragged pile of coats, and her small mouth was parched and gasping.
                     There were bruised spots on the tender knuckles, caused by the vehement blow
                     she had given Burmah.</p>
                  <p>The turnkey picked up her hand, felt her pulse, muttered an oath, dropped the
                     hand, no bigger than a child's, and hurried out of the room.</p>
                  <p>He soon returned, accompanied by a surgeon, who examined the now half-stupefied
                     woman, gave an order to the turnkey, who quitted the cell. He came back,
                     bringing four men and a thin mattress. They lifted Annie Laurie up and laid her
                     on the mattress, and carried her out of this cell into a smaller single one.
                     The surgeon gave her medicine, and a negro woman was put to attend upon
                     her.</p>
                  <p>There Annie lay day after day, wrestling with phantoms bred by fever, until
                     youth triumphed, and at last she slept—a sleep produced by morphine.</p>
                  <p>The fact of her incarceration transpired. A friend, who had money in England,
                     went to Burmah, and by a bribe of five thousand dollars in gold, induced him to
                     relinquish his hold upon his victims, and to release<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000060"/> the father and daughter, upon condition of their
                     being transported immediately beyond the Federal lines.</p>
                  <p>This was gladly acceded to. Mr. Laurie's tottering steps were led to an
                     ambulance in waiting, and there, extended on the mattress on the floor, he
                     found and embraced the weak, emaciated form of his pale child. They were slowly
                     driven out of the city, beyond the lines, into "Dixie."</p>
                  <p>They took refuge eventually in Atlanta. Annie Laurie regained strength. The
                     pure air, the <emph>free</emph> air, gradually restored her forces.</p>
                  <p>Cut off from all pecuniary resources, unwilling to depend longer than necessary
                     on the charity of friends—as soon as she was able to endure the fatigue—she
                     gathered a few pupils together and began to keep a small school; so she was
                     enabled to maintain her father and herself.</p>
                  <p>She tried to communicate with Reginald and with Harold, but for a long time in
                     vain, owing to the perpetual movement of the army, and the irregularity of
                     postal intercourse.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LUCIA FINDS HER BROTHER—REGINALD FINDS LUCIA.</head>
                  <p>LOUISE had found a resting-place on the borders of Texas. She selected a
                     plantation within reasonable distance of Shreveport, as Philip had been
                     transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was often able to run down
                     to see her, for a day or so. She was very calm, though very sad, since the
                     death of her children. She rarely smiled, but made a continuous effort to
                     appear cheerful and interested in matters around her, for the sake of Philip
                     and of Lucia, who was still with her. Lucia had made no progress in the search
                     after her brother as yet. Their abode was a small, plain frame cottage,
                     situated on the San Antonia road. Couriers, officers, soldiers, beef-drivers
                     and travelers were frequent guests here. The inns were far apart, and the
                     simple aboriginal laws of hospitality governed throughout the region. Any
                     wayfarer would stop, for the night, at any house by the roadside, and ask for
                     food or shelter, generally proffering payment on departure, which, of course,
                     in Louise's house, was as duly rejected. The orders were, to the
                     house-servants, never to refuse a meal or shelter to a tired or hungry soldier.
                     Scarcely a day or night passed without some of these involuntary guests being
                     received. They were kindly welcomed and kindly treated, though Louise and
                     Lucia, remaining in their own side of the house, rarely ever saw or spoke with
                     them.</p>
                  <p>Philip came from Shreveport one day, bringing Reginald Laurie with him.
                     Reginald, now promoted to Lieutenant-General had been sent over on business of
                     importance from Richmond.</p>
                  <p>Philip had informed him of Lucia Dare's presence and business in America.
                     Reginald felt himself greatly agitated at the thought of meeting Lucia. He had
                     been trying hard to forget all about her, and now fate seemed to throw her
                     perversely in his path once more. Neither he nor Lucia were very conscious of
                     any of their surroundings. When their cold hands net, trembling, in each
                     other's clasp, Reginald's fingers closed impetuously and involuntarily over
                     her's; but in an instant he recollected himself, and dropped the little
                     quivering hand. Louise carried Philip off for a conjugal tête-a-tête, and
                     Reginald found himself along with Lucia Dare. A few hurried, half-intelligible,
                     confused common-places was all he could proffer by way of entertaining
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>His questions about Gerald, about her father's sudden death, about Mr. Vail,
                     were answered as coherently! as Lucia could manage to reply. Lucia bent her
                     head close and diligently over a yarn sock she was knitting. Louise did and had
                     done all kinds of strong domestic knitting, weaving, dyeing and spinning for
                     the use of the soldiers; Lucia tried to aid her. Lucia felt Reginald's eyes
                     fixed been her, even through her down-cast veiled eyelids; she felt the
                     burning, devouring, eager gaze, and she made sad work with the heel of the
                     sock. She was turning, at last, the snarl becoming unmanageable; by an awkward
                     movement, she ran the end of a knitting-needle in her finger; it hurt her; with
                     a low exclamation she dropped the sock, and held up her finger, from which a
                     few drops of blood were oozing. Reginald hastened to her side, and almost
                     without will, took the small wounded hand in his capacious grasp.</p>
                  <p>"Does it pain much?" he asked, examining the microscopic wound with a tender if
                     not experienced eye.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no, not much! It was so awkward!" replied Lucia, with a tear in her voice,
                     not from pain, but agitation—hysteria probably.</p>
                  <p>Reginald, very likely, recalled his mother's mode of curing a little child's
                     cut finger, for instead of replying courteously and properly, he bent over the
                     wounded hand, and dressed his lips again and again passionately upon it.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, I have, loved you so long and so much, so much!" he said.</p>
                  <p>Lucia turned rose-red all over, just leaning her head against Reginald's
                     shoulder, leaving her hand in his fervent clasp. She burst out in the most
                     piteous sobbing; the tears streamed down her checks without any effort to check
                     or conceal them on her part. It was only natural for Reginald to throw one arm
                     around her, while the other still grasped her hand—to press his lips on the
                     bright brown head, now leaning on his breast.</p>
                  <p>"Lucia, Lucia! my light—my dream—my darling!"</p>
                  <p>And Lucia wept still more, but managed to nestle her head a little closer, may
                     be to hide her face better.</p>
                  <p>They were in this position, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and Louise
                     rushed in, closely followed by Philip. Louise's face was all ablaze with joyful
                     emotion, and Philip's was gladdened with smiles; neither had looked so since
                     the death of their children. Louise had a long open letter in her hand, which
                     she held extended, as if to proclaim by it the hidden cause of her great
                     pleasure; but her eyes falling suddenly on the group so unmistakably
                     lover-like, she stopped short in her impetuous advance, ejaculating: "Good
                     heavens! Ah, Mon Dieu!" Recovering from her dismay, however, almost
                     instantaneously, she exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"It is all right, Lucia, all right! See, your brother is found!"</p>
                  <p>"Where, oh! Where, where is Gerald?" said Lucia, springing from Reginald to
                     Louise, heedless of flushed cheeks and somewhat disarranged hair.</p>
                  <p>"Eh, bien! Lucie, it is very well you seem to have provided yourself with
                     another guardian and comforter," laughed Louise, a little mischievously, "for,
                     ma belle, Gerald is found, but Gerald is already married, and Gerald loves
                     somebody else, better even than you, mignonne."</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, tell me quick," gasped Lucia, clinging to Louise.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! how hasty and cruel I am," exclaimed Louise; "quick, Philip, a glass of
                     water for Lucia. I will tell you, dear, all. Here, drink this; don't faint. Fan
                     her, Redgie, fan her."</p>
                  <p>Louise put her arm around Lucia, and supported her to a chair; Philip brought
                     her water, and Redgie stationed himself at the back of the chair, put his arm
                     about Lucia, and drew her head upon it, while he fanned her with his soft
                     felt-hat, the first substitute for a fan he could seize.</p>
                  <p>Louise knelt down before her.</p>
                  <p>"Quick, quick, tell me." whispered Lucia.</p>
                  <p>Thus adjured, Louise began to read the letter she held, which Philip had
                     brought her among others from Shreveport. It had been brought over by courier
                     who came with despatches from Atlanta. It was from; Annie Laurie, giving a
                     concise but satisfactory account of all that happened to Gerald, Margaret, her
                     father, and herself. It enclosed Margaret's hasty letters after her marriage,
                     and Miss Smith's and Professor Liebermann's.</p>
                  <p>Lucia listened like one in a dream.</p>
                  <p>After reading the letters all through and saying them in Lucia's lap, Louise
                     proceeded to explain all the early portion of Gerald's history—his first
                     introduction to the "Laurie family, through Margaret; Mr. Laurie's fondness for
                     the poor young English lad.</p>
                  <p>Lucia wept and smiled by turns.</p>
                  <p>As Louise concluded her long story, she rose up from her knees, dropped Lucia's
                     hand, kissed her on the forehead, and seizing Philip's arm she drew him out of
                     the room.</p>
                  <p>"Redgie will take care of her," said Louise. "Let us go, Philip."</p>
                  <p>And Lucia, as the door closed on the retiring forms of her considerate friends,
                     threw herself in Redgie's arms, so gladly extended to receive her, exclaiming,
                     "It was your father, my beloved; your father, and your niece!"</p>
                  <p>It does not matter to us what Redginald said in reply, but one expression he
                     did use rather strange.</p>
                  <p>"Thank God!, now you are only the Hon. Miss Dare, with a moderate portion of
                     this world's goods. I am so glad the daughters of your house never receive
                     large endowments."</p>
                  <p>Lucia only laughed at him, slid her wounded finger over his face, and said
                     joyfully:</p>
                  <p>"You are so proud, Reginald; but I am sure I am glad too. Your beautiful niece
                     will make a fitter Lady Dare than I could. Won't she queen it at the
                     Hurst?"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed she will," replied Redgie. "All Miss Smith's lessons in deportment will
                     come into use."</p>
                  <p>Then Lucia had to be told about Miss Smith, and about the Professor, and about
                     Annie Laurie, over and over again; then she cried over Gerald's being in
                     prison; then she clapped her hands, because he was such a brave, gallant
                     soldier; and the end of it all was, that Louise had to come and take her away,
                     lead her to her own room, summon Lizzy Green, who was in an equally crazy
                     condition, have Lucia put to bed, solaced with a cup of tea—a rare and costly
                     prescription in the Confederacy; and Lucia lay there thinking, and praying, and
                     smiling, and weeping, like a very soft-hearted, foolish little woman, as she
                     was, until she sunk into sleep of exhaustion, and dreamed of Gerald and of
                     Reginald all the night.</p>
                  <p>The first thing Lucia said to herself when she awoke the next morning was:</p>
                  <p>"I am only <emph>Miss</emph> Dare. Oh! <emph>Lady</emph> Dare, God bless you
                     forever!"</p>
                  <p>Redgie was waiting for her in the humble breakfast-room, with his hands full of
                     fresh, dewy, prairie flowers; and he ornamented her hair himself, quite in
                     Parisian style, with the fragrant blossoms. Lucia put those that were left
                     after this toilet arrangement<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6308-00000061"/>
                     rangement into a cup, and set the bouquet in the centre of the breakfast table.
                     The viands were very simple on that breakfast table, but there were two very
                     happy hearts seated at it; and Louise and her Philip smiled in reflected
                     light.</p>

                  <head type="sub">LUCIA'S WEDDING.</head>
                  <p>THERE was much discussion of plans for the future in Louise's small breakfast
                     room, which served all the uses of parlor and dining-room. Lucia was naturally
                     anxious to get somewhere near, or at least to some place where she could
                     communicate with Gerald. It was exceedingly difficult to do this from the
                     Trans-Mississippi Department. "Redgie" and Louise had a long, confidential
                     parley, which ended in Redgie's proposing to Lucia that they two should be
                     married at once, without any further delay, and that she should accompany him
                     back to Richmond. He was obliged to return in two days to Shreveport, thence he
                     would proceed immediately to Richmond. Louise seconded Redgie.</p>
                  <p>"I do not like to give you up, Lucia, but it is for your happiness, dear; don't
                     deprive yourself of any days of joy,—besides Redgie is a soldier, and exposed
                     to risk and danger; he might be wounded or killed in battle, then you would
                     regret not listening to his prayer now, Lucia!"</p>
                  <p>Louise's reasoning was conclusive. Lucia agreed to everything. License was
                     readily procured and a clergyman, and Reginald Laurie had a right to claim
                     Lucia Dare the very next day as his own in the face of the whole world. Louise
                     gave them her large tent that she had occupied with her children in the long
                     overland travel, ambulances, and a wagon, and conveniences for Lizzie Green,
                     and other servants were soon provided.</p>
                  <p>On the third day after his arrival at Louise's abode, General and the Honorable
                     Mrs. Laurie, Colonel Branger and attendants, bade Louise farewell, and started
                     for Shreveport. Louise's tall, erect figure swayed fitfully as the cortege
                     passed out of her gateway; but she encircled the wooden post of the little
                     gallery with one arm, and kept herself upright and firm until the last carriage
                     containing Philip had disappeared,—then covering her eyes with her hand, in a
                     hasty motion of pain, she fled to the utter solitude and desolation of her
                     vacant chamber.</p>
                  <p>It was a midsummer dream to Reginald and his bride—the honeymoon passed in this
                     gypsy travel. Lucia's sweet eyes beamed like tender stars; Redgie put aside
                     every care, every thought, during those four weeks spent in journeying through
                     the vast primeval pine forests, except care and thought for his darling—his
                     wife. They were virtually alone, traveling together by day in their ambulance,
                     and at night their tent was pitched by the side of some clear running stream,
                     the cool night winds sighed through the tall pines, waving the odorous
                     tree-tops, and the moonlight shone down unsullied and pure over all
                        <emph>their</emph> earth, and Lucia found that even Gerald held but a second
                     place in her warm, loving heart.</p>

                  <p>They reached the banks of the river safely. Reginald crossed over by night, and
                     waited at a friend's house on the Mississippi side for his wife to join him,
                     protected by her British papers. Lucia had no difficulty in crossing at the
                     usual ferry. She and Lizzie Green soon joined Reginald, and the party moved on
                     rapidly to Richmond, where General Laurie established his wife in apartments,
                     then rejoined his command.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A RENCONTRE.</head>
                  <p>THERE was an evening reception at the house of President Davis, and all the
                     Richmond world was there. The rooms were crowded with officers in uniform and
                     civilians in governmental employ, and women in brilliant dress—for the ladies
                     managed to keep their wardrobes supplied through the smugglers over the Potomac
                     and the blockade runners at Wilmington. But there was no lady in Richmond who
                     could vie in splendor of array with the beautiful creole, Madame Rozanne. Every
                     detail of attire on her was perfect of its kind; gold flowed through her fair
                     fingers like drops of phosphorescent sea-water, so abundant and so careless was
                     she in all matters of expenditure. She reigned par-excellence, queen of her
                     circle. She was here to-night, resplendent in beauty and blazing with diamonds,
                     a coronet of brilliants encircling her golden hair, splendid enough for a
                     princess. She moved, attended by a bevy of adorers. All the lighter moths of
                     society fluttered around her. She had just made her reverence to the President,
                     and stood now toying with her delicate fan, leaning on the arm of Colonel
                     Edward Morris, who was openly acknowledged to be the handsomest man in the
                     Confederate army. Every turn of the hand made the diamonds glitter that covered
                     her arm and her fingers; she was smiling, till her small teeth gleamed white as
                     the cream of the cocoanut between her rose-red lips, and yet the blue eyes did
                     not smile in correspondence; they seemed strangely cold and rayless; bright,
                     but abstract, as if the soul, which ought to have beamed from out those perfect
                     "windows," was sleeping or fled from its tabernacle. She was
                        <emph>carefully</emph> gay; but even to the most superficial observer, the
                     discrepancy between eye and mouth, between feeling and exhibition, was
                     manifest. But she put aside all tender inquiry after herself or her health with
                     a careless wave of her fan.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you must not be rude enough to say I am 'distrait.' Touteau contraire—I
                        <emph>choose</emph> to be very gay and charmante to-night. Has Felicie
                     failed in my toilette?"</p>
                  <p>"Failed! Never have I seen Madame so beautiful," eagerly responded Edward
                     Morris; "only I fancied a light cloud over those fair orbs, and did not like to
                     see the resplendence veiled even by a summer shadow!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah! all women have mégrims, you know; and in truth, I have been sad—sad—for my
                     country," added she, warmly, after a minute's pause. "Those reverses of Lee's
                     are very serious, are they not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; but we will soon recover from them I hope, especially since—" Morris
                     checked himself hastily.</p>
                  <p>"Especially since!" continued Madame, inquiringly, lifting her eyes to his,
                     with an expression of sudden, anxious interest.</p>
                  <p>Morris still hesitated. Then lowering his tone, said:</p>
                  <p>"You are so true a patriot, so devotedly Southern, I venture to commit an
                     indiscretion for you; it may console you to know what and <emph>why</emph> we
                     hope, with renewed vigor. Come into this recess."</p>
                  <p>Leading her into a recess slightly shadowed by a curtain, Morris rapidly
                     explained the present plans of a march and campaign, which had been suggested
                     only that morning, and was to be carried immediately into effect. Madame
                     Rozanne listened attentively. She asked the names of the divisions and
                     commanders which were to be sent. Morris repeated them. He was Adjutant-General
                     to General A—— and knew, in virtue of his office, all the movements
                     contemplated. He gave her the names of the commanding officers, and was highly
                     diverted at her merry satirical comments upon each, as his name was called. At
                     last he mentioned "Lieutenant General Laurie." Madame Rozanne started; an
                     involuntary flash escaped her eye; Morris observed it.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know Laurie?" he asked; "he is a Mississippian, and was a good deal
                     abroad."</p>
                  <p>The lady fanned herself slowly.</p>
                  <p>"I have heard the name. What kind of man is he?"</p>
                  <p>"Reginald is a brave fellow—'a proper man to fill a lady's eye;' you would
                     doubtless recall him, had you ever met him; he has been married recently, in a
                     most romantic fashion, in Texas."</p>
                  <p>"Married—in Texas—ah! Tell me the story if it's <emph>romantic,</emph> Colonel
                     Morris?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, to begin properly. Once upon a time there was a lady—but see,
                     Madame—parlez d'une ange et voila ses ailes—here comes the conquering hero and
                     his bride!"</p>
                  <p>Just at this instant the voice of the negro waiter at the door sung out:
                     "Lieutenant-General and the Hon. Mrs. Laurie!"</p>
                  <p>Reginald led his English bride up to the President and Mrs. Davis. Murmurs of
                     admiration swept lightly around through the crowd. Lucia was very lovely—so
                     delicate, so sweet, so patrician in her gentle beauty.</p>
                  <p>Morris heard a slight noise; he turned quickly to his companion; she was
                     looking down at her delicate pearl-handled fan.</p>
                  <p>"See, Colonel Morris! What a misfortune—irreparable in this Confederacy—I have
                     broken my pretty fan!"</p>
                  <p>To take the fragments from her hand and condole with her was the natural
                     impulse of our gallant homme. But as they trifled over the broken toy, General
                     and Mrs. Laurie, turning away from the President, faced them suddenly. In an
                     instant a flush and glance of recognition flashed across the countenances of
                     both. Surprise and confusion, mingled with a glance of anger, which faded into
                     a smile of triumphant exultation, flitted over Reginald's speaking face. Lucia
                     blushed, then grew strangely pale and cold; pain seemed to predominate in her
                     soul at the unexpected meeting. Morris felt his arm quickly grasped, as if by
                     some one who felt herself ready to fall, and who seized, involuntarily, the
                     nearest support; but in an instant the grasp was loosened. Madame Rozanne
                     stepped forward boldly, and with erected head and regal pride, she swept past
                     General and Mrs. Laurie, bestowing on them a haughty and deep inclination of
                     the head, as they stood motionless before her. General Laurie bowed low, with a
                     mocking smile as he looked in her face. Mrs. Laurie responded with the coldest,
                     faintest movement of her head.</p>
                  <p>"Je vous félicite, Mon General," said Madame Rozanne.</p>
                  <p>"Milles rémercimens, Madame la Princesse!" replied Reginald.</p>
                  <p>Edward Morris alone heard the low salutations interchanged, like the challenge
                     of two mortal foes. The words were hissed from Madame Rozanne's rosy lips, and
                     Reginald's reply was uttered through closed teeth, with a slow emphasis on
                     every word.</p>
                  <p>In another moment Madame Rozanne was conversing gaily with a knot of
                     acquaintances; shortly after, she disappeared from the apartment.</p>
                  <p>The next day she disappeared from Richmond, and the brilliant meteor, the
                        young<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6308-00000062"/> creole widow, was never
                     seen in society there again.</p>
                  <p>The night Reginald Laurie was ordered off on duty. Edward Morris called the
                     next day, previous to his departure, on Mrs. Laurie, and in the course of
                     conversation, managed to speak of the beautiful Creole window; but Lucia
                     listened without any recognition of the lady. At last Morris observed:</p>
                  <p>"You saw her at the levee; I thought you knew her."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no!" replied Lucia, "I do not know any Madame Rozanne."</p>
                  <p>Morris described the Creole's appearance and dress.</p>
                  <p>"No" continued Lucia, "I do not know her. I recognized only one lady I knew in
                     Paris and at home in England, Madame la Princesse Roskopff. I wonder what she
                     is doing here?"</p>
                  <p>Morris pressed his inquiries; he had begun to feel some anxiety as well as
                     curiosity about the belle Creole, and to fear lost he had allowed himself to be
                     betrayed into unwise confidences by this fair Delilah.</p>
                  <p>Lucia told him but little; was evidently disinclined to talk about her quondam
                     acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"I went to school with her. She is or was the wife of a Russian prince. I have
                     not seen her for years; she acted unkindly to me; I do not like to speak of
                     her."</p>
                  <p>"Morris called at the house of Madame Rozanne; he found it closed, abandoned
                     except by the people who owned it.</p>
                  <p>"Madame had departed, no one knew where; the little Vadine was gone too, and
                     her nurse. Madame had given up the house; it was for rent; would the gentleman
                     like to see the premises?"</p>
                  <p>Morris accepted the invitation and walked over the deserted house. Faded
                     flowers in the vases, but all the fanciful articles of luxury still in their
                     accustomed places—books, music, etc.</p>
                  <p>"Madame was very liberal," said the woman, who showed the house. "She gave up
                     all these beautiful things—threw them in, saying, 'she disliked to
                     inconvenience us by giving up the house so suddenly; but she received
                     intelligence, which compelled her to leave Richmond immediately."</p>
                  <p>In the apartment which had been Madame's own, Morris spied a half-burned piece
                     of paper sticking in the ashes of the grate; he took it out, shook the ashes
                     off; it was an old envelope, addressed to "The Princesse Roskopff; Rue Saint
                     Honoré, Paris," and it contained on the back, hastily scrawled in pencil, the
                     names of the Confederate generals and the force of the divisions that Morris
                     had himself given to Madame Rozanne at the levee, when explaining the
                     contemplated movements of the Confederate army.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE SERPENT STRIKES AGAIN.</head>
                  <p>ON the 3rd of May, 1864, began the series of battles around Richmond between
                     Lee and the Federal forces, now world-famous. Lee found his earliest movements
                     checked. Madame Rozanne had done her part bravely. At the first onslaught the
                     Confederates were driven back with heavy loss. It was here that Lieut.-General
                     Laurie and Colonel Ashton were posted. In an attempt to rally his troops,
                     Laurie was severely wounded, and had to be carried to the rear. Ashton rushed
                     forward, trying to lead his regiment on to some pieces of artillery which were
                     raking the Confederate forces. Struck by shell, his horse dropped under him,
                     and at the same instant the canister shot struck him full in the breast—without
                     a word he fell dead to the earth. His men seized the yet warm body and
                     retreated en masse". "General Laurie," the Richmond papers stated, "was
                     scarcely expected to survive his terrible wounds." And then there was a long
                     obituary notice of the gallant Colonel Ashton. "Sister Euphrasie" read this
                     with a strange smile, as she returned from a visit to the hospitals at Atlanta.
                     The beguine looked careworn and pale; and the strong contrast between her blue
                     eyes and raven eyebrows, ashes and hair, struck one more painfully from the
                     lack of bloom in the cheeks and lips. There was a sort of dissonance in this
                     mixture of color—one would have fancied more blonde tresses with those eyes and
                     complexion.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie had risen early and had begun to make household arrangements for
                     her father's breakfast. Already the bread made by her own hands, and the cup of
                     warm milk, all she could get to comfort his weak body, smoked on the table. He
                     had been tenderly met and carefully led to his chair, and the buttered bread
                     and milk placed before him. Then Annie took her own meal of bread without
                     butter and a cup of cold water. She could only indulge luxuries for her father.
                     Meat they had usually once a day, or at least Mr. Laurie had. Blind, he never
                     knew anything of his daughter's constant self-abnegation. At that moment the
                     news-boy rapped at the door with the daily morning paper. Annie took it and
                     began to read it aloud to her father—turning of course first to the military
                     intelligence. She read the account of the battle—suddenly in the list of the
                     wounded she came on her brother's name. She gave a cry—but checked herself, and
                     continued to read aloud:</p>
                  <p>"Lieut;-General Laurie, severely wounded; Colonel Harold Ashton—"her voice
                     failed—her hands fell, clutching the paper in their grasp. Her eyes closed, her
                     head drooped forward on her bosom; she looked dying—her nostrils were
                     drawn—every muscle set in anguish—a yellow, mortal pallor spread over her
                     face—not a word; scarcely a breath moved her breast for a moment to show that
                     she lived. At last the breath came back, and with the inspiration burst out one
                     long, harrowing shriek:</p>
                  <p>"My Harold—oh, God! my Harold!"</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie fell forward, prostrate on her face on the floor at her father's
                     feet.</p>
                  <p>The poor, trembling, helpless old man, convulsed and frightened, got up out of
                     his chair, and guiding himself, with his hands sliding along the table, reached
                     the spot where Annie lay, crushed to the dust under the weight of her woe. Her
                     father's foot touched the prostrate head. Sinking down on the floor by her, Mr.
                     Laurie raised his child's head on his knee. Consciousness was
                     returning—consciousness of a destroyed life—of a sorrow without measure, and
                     beyond hope.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Annie, my child—my darling!—Don't die, Annie—don't die and leave your poor
                     old father desolate!" groaned the wretched old man.</p>
                  <p>A low, gasping moan was Annie's only reply. But she was not heedless of the
                     appeal. When, in her beautiful self-denying life, had she ever been insensible
                     to the pleading voice of the blind man? She moved her hand and slid it in her
                     father's and tried to press his; but she could not speak—not yet—not yet. Gasp
                     after gasp, as if of one struggling in death-agony, escaped from her pale lips.
                     She lay so for ten minutes: Mr. Laurie bent over and kissed her hair. He called
                     her every tender, loving—every pleading name. Annie did not refuse his
                     caresses, but at every word of fondness she shivered, as if an exposed nerver
                     was carefully touched. At last, by a powerful effort, putting up her hand she
                     grasped the table and staggered to her feet—she put out her trembling hand and
                     laid it on her father's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"Get up, father," she whispered, know I have you left still—I know it; but now
                     let me call little Emma to sit with you a while. You will bid her—tell the
                     children—I can not—teach to-day—I must go to my room—I must be alone
                     awhile—father—after awhile—it will be better—"</p>
                  <p>Little Emma, a charity scholar, who often came to aid Annie Laurie in her
                     household labors—from love alone—looked alarmed when the door of the kitchen
                     opened, and the pale, miserable face of Annie Laurie appeared within it. Annie
                     spoke in a hoarse whisper. She had no voice; grief had stricken her almost into
                     dumbness.</p>
                  <p>"Emma, stay with my father awhile. I am ill, little Emma."</p>
                  <p>Annie writhed her hands nervously and unconsciously together as she spoke.
                     Little Emma burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"You must not weep—you <emph>must</emph> not—I <emph>can't, I can't,</emph>
                     little Emma, go to my father—oh, go!"</p>
                  <p>The door closed noiselessly. Little Emma, wiping the tears from her cheeks with
                     her coarse apron, went softly into Mr. Laurie. He was sitting on his chair,
                     with his leaning on his hands, sunk in grief. Emma pulled a low stool near him,
                     and sat quietly looking at the old man with wonder and pity. At last,
                     perceiving the breakfast things still remaining unremoved, she took them away,
                     put the room deftly in order, then taking up her work she sat down again,
                     glancing up every now and then, with childish curiosity, at the bowed figure in
                     the chair before her. Hour after hour sped on.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie got up, and asking little Emma's aid, be tottered to Annie's chamber
                     door; and leaning his head against it, listened. Not a sound of life even
                     reached <emph>his</emph> sensitive ears, sharpened as all other senses were by
                     his blindness and his eager Interest now.</p>
                  <p>"Little Emma," he whispered, "look through the key-hole—tell me if my child
                     lives!"</p>
                  <p>Startled and awe-struck the child obeyed. Then drawing back, with a long,
                     quivering sigh, almost ready to dissolve in tears, little Emma whispered:</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, she's living! She's lying on the bed, with her hands up over her
                     head; her eyes are shut; she's breathing—but, oh! Mr. Laurie, she looks so
                     awful! hadn't I better go in?"</p>
                  <p>"No! let her alone. We can't help her, little Emma. Nobody but God can. Pray
                     for her, little Emma—pray for her. Her poor heart is crushed to atoms! Oh, my
                     child! my good, good, loving, tender child! Lead me back, little Emma."</p>
                  <p>And so the day was spent. Every hour or so the trembling form of the old man
                     was led to the door of Annie's room; and still she lay prone, helpless,
                     stupefied in her anguish!</p>
                  <p>The darkness of night had spread over the city when Annie Laurie entered again
                     the room in which she had left her father that morning. Little Emma had lit a
                     candle and brought some bread and milk for the old man's supper; but in vain
                     had she entreated him to touch even so much as a drop of water all the day
                     long. Now she stood by him, urging him to break his fast, but he gently
                     rejected her loving entreaties. Annie Laurie took the small walter from the
                     child's hand. Bending over her father, she kissed his brow.</p>
                  <p>"You will eat for <emph>me</emph> my father." The voice was lower and weaker
                     than usual, but it did not tremble.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, my child! have you come back? Thank God! Yes, I will do anything you
                     desire since you have come back to me!"</p>
                  <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6308-00000063"/>
                  <p>Annie stroked the long, silvery locks from his forehead with her soft, velvety
                     hand, while he hastily ate the bread and swallowed the milk, so necessary to
                     sustain his feeble frame.</p>
                  <p>Little Emma saw the face, aged and drawn as if with years of illness, that
                     Annie Laurie wore now, would wear on earth forever, and the child's tears
                     streamed afresh. From that moment Annie Laurie resumed all her duties towards
                     her father—she lived solely for him.</p>
                  <p>They communicated with Reginald, who survived, and was slowly convalescing
                     under the devoted nursing of his wife, in Richmond. Reginald put a stop to
                     Annie's teaching, and to the most arduous drudgery of her daily life. It was
                     well; for Annie was conscious of failing strength. The internal wound in her
                     heart never closed—never could close. Her life was bleeding noiselessly away,
                     day by day. She prayed only to survive her father—she was so necessary to him.
                     She knew this, and so she <emph>tried</emph> to live. It was piteous to see how
                     she economized her vitality—the efforts she made to keep it up; but the light
                     foot fell slower and slower, and heavy nightsweats, and constant fitful fever,
                     told severely on her tender frame: her voice, always low and vibrating, had
                     acquired a plaintiveness that touched every heart—it was so full of unshed
                     tears, like the cooing of a wounded dove. Breathing was often painful to her,
                     especially at night. The light was fast dying out of the alabaster lamp; but
                     the old blind father never knew it. There was none to tell him.</p>
                  <p>"Sister Euphrasie" continued her charitable labors at the hospital. Sometimes
                     her hasty steps paused before Mr. Laurie's humble gate, and when she saw the
                     old man's trembling step as he paced the open gallery, led and half-supported
                     by the slender, fragile form of his daughter—when she looked into Annie's
                     grief-stricken face, so pallid, and so grey, even the brown hair beginning to
                     show long flakes of white now—Sister Euphrasia laughed a bitter, hollow laugh.
                     "It is his father and his sister—I have struck home there." But the people
                     followed the beguine, and blessed her as if she was some holy, holy saint. "For
                     was she not an angel of goodness to the soldiers in the hospital!" And Annie
                     Laurie smiled her sweet, sad smile, whenever the brown-clad beguine past. She
                     too, would add her mite of gratitude to the kind Sister of Charity; and once
                     "Sister Euphrasie" muttured:</p>
                  <p>"It was the wrong one who died; I would have spared <emph>her,</emph> if I
                     could only have hit the mortal blow on the other!"</p>
                  <p>Then "Sister Euphrasie" crossed over into the trans-Mississippi region.</p>

                  <head type="sub">ONCE MORE THE SERPENT STRIKES.</head>
                  <p>THE beguine was quite well known in Alexandria and Nachitoches now. It was the
                     day after the battle of Mansfield. Philip Branger had fallen in the van of
                     Mouton's famous charge. He had been picked up and transported with the other
                     wounded Federal and Confederate to the little town of Mansfield, where the
                     college buildings and other large tenements were rudely arranged for their
                     reception. Private houses had been thrown open to receive these melancholy
                     guests. The citizens, especially the women, had flocked to the field, to nurse
                     and tend the sufferers. They came from twenty, thirty miles around, in
                     carriages, carts, wagons—every sort of vehicle, laden with such comforts and
                     delicacies as the privations of war had left them, eager to minister to the
                     needs of the wounded, bleeding soldiers. Philip had been conveyed to the ground
                     floor of a large three-story building, that had been used as a warehouse or
                     place of deposit, each room extending the length and breadth of the frame-made
                     one story. These were supplied with numerous lofty windows and large, double
                     doors of entrance, like huge granaries. They made capital dormitories. Owing to
                     the scarcity of cots or matresses, the floors of these apartments were quickly
                     strewn, a foot or so deep, with soft, raw cotton, in the lint, obtained from
                     gin-houses in the vicinity, and a blanket over this, furnished a soft, and not
                     uncomfortable, improvised bed for the wounded. Every room was filled with these
                     unfortunate men; surgeons were busy, and tender women's hands aided everywhere,
                     to bind up the wounds or to give drink to the thirsty. In many spots the
                     snow-white lint was wet and crimson witk blood, and faint moans frequently
                     testified to the existence of pain beyond mortal power to endure in silence.
                     Philip had been laid in a corner, near one of the large doors; his wounds,
                     through the body, almost forbade hope, and the surgeon compressed his lips
                     sternly, as he examined, and dressed them, and turned suddenly away, to avoid
                     answering the look of anxious inquiry that the wife of the wounded officer
                     raised to his face. Louise was there, kneeling by her husband. An expression of
                     agony passed over her face, and her dark eyes dilated in fierce horror, as the
                     surgeon turned speechlessly away from her, and bent hastily over the prostrate
                     form lying on the bed adjoining. A shudder ran over her, and shook her from
                     head to foot; then she bent down again over her husband—silently, but
                     self-controlled. Philip knew her. He whispered, "Louise," and smiled as she
                     kissed him, and an expression of pleasure spread over his countenance, as he
                     felt her long, taper fingers smoothing his hair, bathing his brow, or gently
                     laid upon his helpless hands. Louise was strangely quiet and still, every
                     movement was light and noiseless. All the powers of her volcanic nature were
                     compressed into absolute quiescence, by the force of her strong will. She saw
                     the surgeon thought Philip must die, and she nerved herself to make his last
                     hours calm, and as comfortable as she could.</p>
                  <p>"Time enough to weep—after"—</p>
                  <p>After—<emph>what?</emph> Oh! poor Louise!</p>
                  <p>Once more the stolid, fixed, animal expression stamped itself on her face—that
                     terrible look, with which she had watched her babes die in the Pine Forest. But
                     she said not a word—not a word.</p>
                  <p>"My God!" murmured the surgeon to himself, "how that woman suffers, and will
                     suffer; it is horrible!" and he kept away as much as he could from the corner
                     where Philip lay dying.</p>
                  <p>The day waned, the night came—Philip's life was waning fast. Deep, dark shadows
                     settled over the large, lofty room, and all was quiet, save a low groan of
                     occasional, intense, spasmodic pain. Philip was not suffering much; his life
                     was ebbing away from exhaustion, from internal hemorrhage. There was only one
                     dim lamp in the centre of the room; on account of the combustible cotton lint,
                     lights were forbidden. A few men lay, half slumbering, on benches, who were put
                     there to act as nurses to the wounded.</p>
                  <p>The surgeons had made their round, and would not return again until midnight.
                     The women were gone—turned out of the wards until morning should come. Louise,
                     alone, sat on the floor by Philip's side, her head bowed down, his face turned
                     to her, so that she felt his breath growing chill, more and more icy, upon her
                     fevered cheek.</p>
                  <p>A slight noise disturbed her. Raising her head, (herself undistinguished in the
                     dark shadow of the corner in which she sat.) she saw a woman entering the
                     apartment—a woman peculiarly clad, in a dress that Louise recognized, having
                     often seen it in Europe, the brown gown, the pure linen coif and guimpe of a
                     beguine.</p>
                  <p>With a listless glance, Louise watched this woman, as she glided along aisle
                     after aisle of wounded men, carrying a small, dark lantern in her hand, which
                     she turned so that the light fell full on the face of the exhausted sleepers.
                     She was evidently seeking some one. There was a sort of fascination for Louise
                     in the beguine's noiseless tread, her stealthy movements. She awakened no one,
                     except one of the slumbering nurses, who looked up and muttered, "Sister
                     Euphrasie," and settled himself back again to slumber. So the beguine passed
                     on, up and down the pallets, until she reached one next to that which Philip
                     occupied; apparently her search was ended here. It was the couch of a
                     Confederate officer; he was sleeping. Sinking down on her knees by him, the
                     beguine flashed her lamp in his face. He did not move. Then she paused, looking
                     carefully around the whole room. Louise held her breath, closed her fiery eyes,
                     and drew back deeper into the shadow. Something in the beguine struck her
                     singularly: some chord of reminiscence seemed to be suddenly awakened. But
                     Louise felt sure she had never seen that marble white face, with its gleaming
                     blue eyes, and raven black hair and brows.</p>
                  <p>Louise passed her hand over her own brow with a troubled motion. She was
                     herself in such a state of exalted, concentrated vitality, that she was not
                     certain of any of her own faculties, least of all of memory. She had seen that
                     face somewhere—somewhere. It had floated vaguely before her, but she could not
                     fix it.</p>
                  <p>The beguine, assured that slumber hung over all about her, bent gently over the
                     pillow of the officer, and sliding her hand beneath it, drew out his coat. She
                     now proceeded dexterously to subtract the contents of his pockets. She selected
                     a paper from the articles in her hand, then carefully replacing all the rest,
                     watch, purse, etc., etc., she rose gently from her knees to her feet, a smile
                     of satisfaction stealing over her face, as if she had secured what was of value
                     to her. As that smile broke over her face, parting her lips, and bringing
                     momentary brightness into her pallid countenance, sudden, unaccountable,
                     inspired recognition broke over Louise's mind.</p>
                  <p>Yes, different as were the surroundings, she knew that face, that smile!</p>
                  <p>Springing suddenly, noiselessaly, as a panther on its prey, Louise leaped
                     across Philip's feet, and seized the beguine in a relentless grasp, while she
                     hissed in her astonished ear two words, "<emph>Grace Sharp!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The beguine started, tried to wrench herself clear from the immovable hands,
                     but in vain. Her lamp dropped from her hand, the glass crashed. In an instant,
                     the light cotton lint, with which the floor was strewn, blazed high. With a cry
                     of horror, which rang shrilly throughout the whole building, Louise flung the
                     beguine off from her, and sprang to her husband's couch, which began to be
                     enveloped in light, quick, running flame. Louise was tall and lithe, and now
                     love gave her supernatural strength. She seized Philip in her arms, half
                     lifting, half dragging him out of the door—out, out, beyond the reach of the
                     fire from the now blazing building—laid him down on the grass, and fell
                     exhausted beside him.</p>
                  <p>All was wild confusion behind her now. The people, roused by the terrible cries
                     of fire, ran here from every quarter of the<pb n="126-127"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000064"/> town in their night gear. Water was brought; men
                     rushed in to save the wounded; the poor sufferers dragged themselves to the
                     doors, and threw themselves out of the windows. Cries of terror, anguish, pity,
                     and despair, were confusedly mingled on the night wind which fanned the cruel,
                     hungry flames! It was impossible to save the house, or, alas! to save
                        <emph>all</emph> the wounded soldiers. Those on the upper floor were
                     suffocated with smoke before they could be reached! Men and women made
                     agonized, superhuman efforts to get to them. Women fell fainting and senseless
                     from intensity of sympathy and compassion; bold men wrung their hands and wept
                     as they saw the building burn fiercely, rapidly away, the rejoicing flames,
                     inter-looking themselves, waving triumphal streamers of red, furious, glaring
                     fire above this fearful funereal pyre of so many brave living heroes. The
                     people of Mansfield shudder yet at the mention of the burnt hospital.</p>
                  <p>Louise and Philip were picked up and conveyed by sympathizing hands to a
                     private house. Two hours after the fire, before the day dawned, Louise Branger
                     was a widow! She stood beside her dead husband; she took the handkerchief they
                     had tied about the dead man's face—she held it on his wound until it was
                     crimson, then she folded it carefully, thrust it in her bosom, as she said:</p>
                  <p>"Husband, children, all, gone!—all—nothing left but my country, and," throwing
                     out her clenched hand, "vengeance! vengeance!"</p>
                  <p>The beguine escaped in the confusion of the fire. She was seen again, as the
                     Federal fleet sailed past Alexandria, standing on the deck of one of the
                     iron-clads. Then "Sister Euphrasie" disappeared as entirely as Madame Rozanne
                     had done.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sharp took up her residence not very long afterwards in Augusta, Georgia,
                     accompanied by her little daughter, Vadine. They lived very quietly, and were
                     not much noticed. There was such a whirl and unquiet throughout the Confederacy
                     that people were to be discovered in the most inappropriate and most
                     incongruous localities.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sharp always wore a glove on one hand, and a curious gossip said that,
                     seeing it by accident, this hand was covered with fearful scars, as if from
                     burns; very different it was from the tender, delicate, white left hand.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Sharp was a very beautiful woman, however; though so colorless, with rouge
                     she would be exquisite. Her little daughter, Vadine, seemed to be a good deal
                     puzzled by all around her. In the first place, she spoke English most
                     imperfectly, which made the children of the neighbors laugh at her; and
                     sometimes, when they would call her, in their play, "Vadine Sharp," she would
                     look at them with a half-troubled expression, for a moment, as if she did not
                     understand what they meant. Then she would toss back her long, blonde curls,
                     laugh, and say:</p>
                  <p>"Sharp! vat is? Est ce que, c'est Roskopff en Anglais? Dis it mus be!"</p>
                  <p>"Talk English, Vadine; we don't understand your French."</p>
                  <p>"Quelle mer veille! et moi, toujours—toujours, je savais le Français—mais
                     Anglais. Non, non! je ne l'aime pas!"</p>
                  <p>"Vadine, we like to play with you, because you play so gay; but you must talk
                     like us. It is no fun if you don't."</p>
                  <p>"Eh, bien; den I will—but you muss me teach. I not know Anglais; an it,
                     sitriste, si triste, pour moi. Den you not play me wid! I have personne for
                     talk. Aglaè, mon Aglaè, ma bonne, elle est parti, et maman. Maman, ne parle que
                     rarement presque jamais avec moi, et quoi que ma poupeé est si jolie—elle ne
                     peut pas parlér!"</p>
                  <p>"Vadine, what makes your ma always wear a glove?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh! la main! le jolie, blanche main de maman, est toute bruleé—c'etaite une
                     lampe, qui etaite cassee qui a faite ça! Mais verrons nous jouir. Ah! let oos
                     play—enseignez moi. Teach a me; I will Anglais talk."</p>
                  <p>Running, jumping, laughing, Vadine accomplished perfectly, so the children made
                     the best they could of her, and the lonely little child, whose mamma was almost
                     as silent to her as her doll, grew happier and rosier, and acquired some
                     English every day; but the children never learned much of her previous history
                     from her. She would talk, wildly, sometimes of a splendid establishment, of
                     carriages and horses, of Madame la Princess, her mamma, and declare her name
                     was Roskopff, which the children corrupted to "Rose-cup." So they nicknamed her
                     "Little Rosy-cup"—a very pretty and not inappropriate name for the lovely,
                     brilliant child.</p>
                  <p>"It is a good title for you, Vadine; your cheeks are like little pink roses,"
                     said one of the biggest boys, kissing the shining, beaming face of the merry
                     child, "Dear little Rosy-cup."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH!</head>
                  <p>IT was the day preceding the battle of Franklin. The Confederate army, under
                     Hood, had just halted to bivouac. The sun was setting, the troops were weary,
                     they had been marching rapidly all day. Hood was very desirous to strike a
                     heavy blow on Schofield at Franklin, in order to prevent his escape into the
                     strong works about Nashville. It was very important to secure Nashville, and so
                     control the State of Tenessee. Hood's army had been fighting desperate battles
                     ever since he took command on the 18th of July, 1864.</p>
                  <p>The division under Stewart had been now halted in a pleasant, wooded spot,
                     close by the banks of a broad, clear, running creek. All were busy making
                     arrangements for the few hours' rest. The cavalry men were grooming, feeding,
                     watering their weary horses; the artillery men were unlimbering; the infantry
                     men had thrown themselves down to rest under the welcome shade, footsore and
                     tired; some provident ones were pitching their low tents, getting out their
                     frying-pans, mixing their meal for bread. Bustle and gay talk everywhere
                     resounded through the encampment; some of the men had hauled out of their
                     thread-bare pockets old greasy packs of cards, and had taken refuge from the
                     privations of their lot in the excitement of gambling. In a little while the
                     suppers were devoured, the horses fed, the men rested. The moon rose clear and
                     full, flinging her beams widely over the camp in repose. Ever and anon rose
                     snatches of song, and all noise was hushed in one quarter of the camp as an
                     artillery-man burst out into singing, in a fine baritone voice, the favorite
                     ditty of the Washington Artillery: <q>

                  <p>The song itself was very absurd,—the music corresponding most admirably and
                     ludicrously with the foolish words,—but the refrain was very slow and sad, made

                  <p>Every head sunk as the voices subsided into quiet at the memory of the noble
                     hero whose death was a fatal stab at the heart of the Confederacy.</p>
                  <p>"Well, God bless old Jack wherever he is!" exclaimed a rough soldier,
                     reverently lifting his tattered hat from his head as he spoke. "And if it is to
                     be my fate to fall in one of these fights, I'd like mightily to follow him in
                     the other world as I have done in this for many and many a mile. If there is a
                     good place up yonder, he is gone there sure."</p>
                  <p>Murmurs of acquiescence rose all around him.</p>
                  <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6308-00000065"/>
                  <p>The man who spoke was reclining half extended on the grass, leaning against the
                     tree; several companions were lying stretched out around him.</p>
                  <p>"Just look yonder at Dumb Louis," said one, speaking in a low voice.</p>
                  <p>They all turned their heads to see. Some distance off, apart from the camp, was
                     stretched a low tent, not larger than sufficient to cover one man; beneath it
                     was spread a black oil cloth upon the earth, and over this a blanket. Near this
                     tent, sitting on the bank, looking steadily into the running water, crouched
                     together, with his hands clasped round his knees, sat a slight, spare youth—a
                     boy. He appeared in the pure moonlight of not more than seventeen summers; his
                     hair was short and raven black, combed straight down over his fore head; his
                     eyes, dark and flashing, had at times a fitful, almost maniacal, sparkle in
                     them; his features were fine and regular, as delicate as a woman's, and the
                     long, well-shaped taper fingers, now restlessly and ceaselessly unclosing and
                     then interlocking themselves, might have been a woman's. He was habited in a
                     grey cloth hunting-shirt and full Zouave pants, girded round the slender waist
                     with a black leather belt, to which hung his holsters and the sheath of a
                     bowie-knife. Even the heavy boots did not conceal the smallness of his
                     feet.</p>
                  <p>The song of the artillery-man seemed to have affected him exceedingly; tears
                     were coursing rapidly down his olive cheek,—it almost appeared without his
                     consciousness. As he sat rocking himself backwards and forwards, in an appare
                     forgetfulness of all about him, the old trooper rose, and stealing gently and
                     noiselessly to him, laid his hand on the youth's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>In an instant Louis had wrenched himself clear from the unexpected grasp, and,
                     standing in a wild, graceful attitude of startled defiance, held his glittering
                     bowie-knife unsheathed in his nervous hand.</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw, Louis, put up your knife, it is only me! What troubles you so much, my
                     poor boy?"</p>
                  <p>Dumb Louis smiled, put the knife back in its sheath, and turned away, waving
                     his hand silently to the old trooper. Then crawling under his tent, the dumb
                     boy jealously fastened the canvas down on every side, and drew the blanket over
                     his head. The sentry said he often heard heavy sobs and moans from under that
                     low tent as he paced his rounds at night. But they all Knew Dumb Louis too
                     well; no one cared to intrude upon him, especially as they possessed no means
                     of communication, except by signs on his part. He seemed to hear and understand
                     all one said to him, but had no way of replying expect by pantomine. They had
                     grown used to his ways now; though when he had just appeared among them,
                     several months since, they had wondered at, and teazed him a good deal, but he
                     was established now as a sort of pet in the regiment, and they bestowed the
                     same consideration on him that they did on the dogs or goats they fondled about
                     the camp.</p>
                  <p>Dumb Louis had appeared among them on the eve of a heavy skirmish, and he had,
                     without permission asked or given placed himself in the first line of ——'s
                     infantry. He had fought desperately, vehemently—rushing on with headlong
                     audacity, apparently indifferent whether he was killed or not. The only gleam
                     of joy in his usually sad face; the only brightness ever seen in his nearly
                     always downcast eyes, were visible in these times of strife. His eyes would
                     blaze, and his laugh was as satanical as a hyena's, as enemy after enemy went
                     down before him.</p>
                  <p>"His spring is like a catamount," said old Lemple, to whom alone Louis showed
                     any sign of relaxation into geniality; and even this consisted only in the
                     fact, that being ill once on a march, Louis had sat by him night after night in
                     the wagon, bathing his head and waiting on him with a skill and dexterity that
                     old Lemple said "reminded him of his darter Emily."</p>
                  <p>Louis had thus been quietly accepted by his company. He carried his own little
                     tent, blanket and stew-pan on a roll on his back; marched unfalteringly day
                     after day with the best of them, though sometimes he would look very, very
                     weary, and old Lemple would want to take the knapsack from off the young back,
                     which seemed to bend under the burthen; but Dumb Louis would shake his head and
                     push him gently away, never accepting any aid from any one.</p>
                  <p>He always pitched his little tent near old Lemple's, but apart from the rest of
                     the camp; cooked his own simple repast—living this strange, silent life among
                     the noisy soldiers, reports had reached the officers—even the
                     commander-in-chief—of the queer dumb boy who had "volunteered," who never
                     spoke, "but fought like the d—l." More than once the officers halted in their
                     rounds to observe him, but he never noticed them; and as his lieutenants and
                     captain spoke most commendingly of his conduct in every respect, Dumb Louis was
                     put on the muster-roll and regularly adopted in the corps.</p>
                  <p>The battle of Franklin began at four P. M., on the 30th of November. Stewart's
                     corps was placed in position on the right. The line advanced with orders to
                     drive the enemy at the point of the bayonet across the Big Harpeth River; while
                     Gen. Forrest, if successful, was to cross the river and attack and destroy his
                     trains and broken columns. The troops moved forward briskly to the attack. They
                     carried the first line of the enemy's works, then attacked the interior line.
                     They were repulsed—the color-bearer of ——'s corps was killed. As the flag fell,
                     Dumb Louis, who was near, sprang forward and seized it. Turning to the
                     Confederates, his eyes blazing, with a cry that thrilled every heart, and
                     filled the soldiers, who knew of his dumbness, with superstitious ardor—Dumb
                     Louis sprang on before the troops, over the breast works, into the enemy's
                     second line. The men rushed after him. Cleburne's cavalry charged over now.
                     Many of the men were killed entirely inside this work. A mine ball struck Dumb
                     Louis in the right arm. He quietly changed the colors to his left hand and
                     stood firm. A ball struck his leg—he fell upon one knee, still holding the flag
                     aloft, while the blood poured fast from his wounds. Finding his strength fast
                     failing, Dumb Louis struck the pointed iron end of the flag-staff into the
                     earth, and folding his arms around the staff, half leaning against, half
                     supporting it, he kept it steady. Another ball came, striking him full in the
                     breast, making the colors wave as he sunk—the flag dropped suddenly to the
                     earth. Dumb Louis lay dead beneath its folds. The Confederates were driven
                     back. Cleburne's men held their position.</p>
                  <p>Old Lemple told afterwards, when the battle was over, to General Gibson, as he
                     rode along in the early morning twilight:</p>
                  <p>"General, here is where we charged, and if the boys had only known it along the
                     whole line, we carried the works and could have held them. The Yanks gave way
                     in front of my company and regiment, and some of the boys got over, but they
                     were killed or captured, because the enemy not being equally pressed at other
                     points, rallied and were reinforced. All we needed was for everybody to have
                     jumped over the works together at the same moment, and then we would have had
                     them. To do this we all formed and cried out for our old General to give the
                     word, and we called, and called, and called, but he never came; and so many of
                     the boys were killed, and the enemy got so strong we had to give it up. All
                     this time our old General was dead. I knew he must be dead, else he would have
                     come to us, and we would have driven the last Yankee into the river."</p>
                  <p>The struggle lasted till midnight, when the Federals abandoned their works and
                     crossed the river, leaving their dead and wounded in possession of the
                     Confederates.</p>
                  <p>During the day Hood's humanity had prevented him from using his artillery, on
                     account of the women and children remaining in the town.</p>
                  <p>The noblest dead that ever fell upon a battle-field lie at Franklin. In no
                     other battle, during the whole war, was superior valor displayed on <emph>both
                        sides.</emph> Only the wave of the hand, only the twinkle of the eye,
                     perhaps only the death of Cleburne—his inability to respond to the call of his
                     men, waiting for him to lead them, separated the disaster on the Confederate
                     side from a tremendous, a crushing, a complete victory. The wave of successful
                     advance rolled against the works, and for a moment hung pausing above them,
                     when, as if by Divine flat, is subsided.</p>
                  <p>The Confederates were now withdrawn and massed, ready for another attack at
                     day-break; but the enemy retired. The Confederates now proceeded to the
                     melancholy task of burying their dead and caring for their wounded.</p>
                  <p>Old Lemples started on with two of his comrades to seek the body of Dumb Louis.
                     They searched along the lines; at last they reached a spot where the strife had
                     raged fiercest. Men and horses lay thick, one commingled mass of clay. One
                     horse was stretched full length upon his belly, the two force feet resting over
                     the breast-work on the enemy's side, the hind legs extended back, and the head
                     drooped to the earth kept in that position by his master's body, which lay
                     partly under and against him—still grasping his sword, with the frown of battle
                     on his brow, lay Granbury, for he was the bold rider who had made that fatal
                     dash.</p>
                  <p>Not far from him, entirely inside the works, still covered by the folds of the
                     flag, they round Dumb Louis. Old Lemple's voice was husky, and he dashed the
                     briny drops from his eyes as he gazed on the inanimate corpse of his
                     favorite.</p>
                  <p>"Take him up gently, boys. Poor fellow! he did his <unclear>duty</unclear> like
                     a man. We'll bury him over there in the green woods, under the shadow of the
                     big trees. He used always to like to lie under the trees by himself."</p>
                  <p>They picked up the slight body, laid it in a blanket, and bore it off. After
                     digging the grave, they turned to wrap up the corpse.</p>
                  <p>"Straighten him out, boys, and wrap him up good. See, here's his own tarpaulin,
                     take this," said old Lemple.</p>
                  <p>They spread the oil-cloth down on the ground and laid the body on it.</p>
                  <p>"What little hands and feet," exclaimed one of the men.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he was nothing but a lad."</p>
                  <p>"What's the glittering round his neck?"</p>
                  <p>Old Lemple stooped over the pulled out the links of a gold chain. At the end of
                     it was fastened a small leather bag, carefully sewed. Lemple unfastened a
                     button of the boy's jacket to extract the bag; as he did so, he fell back
                     almost into the arms of his companions.</p>
                  <p>"Good God!" he exclaimed, dropping the chain upon the breast of the corpse.</p>
                  <p>"What is it—what is it, Lemple?"</p>
                  <p>"My God! it's a woman!"</p>
                  <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6308-00000066"/>
                  <p>The men stood as if stunned.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, in an instant they recognized the truth. As the body lay relaxed,
                     elongated, the small hands crossed on the rounded breast, concealed as it was
                     by the rather long, loose hunting shirt, they saw the outline of a woman's
                     form.</p>
                  <p>Lemple stooped over, and reverently fastened the button he had opened. Then
                     taking the chain from off the neck, he laid the head down, and wrapped the
                     tarpaulin carefully around it.</p>
                  <p>"Give me your knife; let me open this."</p>
                  <p>He cut open the small leathern bag—a diamond cross flashed upon the eyes of the
                     astonished men, folded up in a handkerchief covered with blood-stains and
                     paper. The paper contained the commission of Colonel Philip Branger to the
                     Confederate army; and below it was written this sentence, both in English and
                     French:</p>

                  <p>The men proceeded to inter the body in perfect silence, after old Lemple read
                     this note. Tenderly they laid the clay into its kindred earth, and heaped the
                     dust above it. After all was done, old Lemple took off his hat, and raising his
                     eyes reverently to heaven, said simply:</p>
                  <p>"O, God, who knows all things—give rest and joy to this poor soul!" And the men
                     answered—"Amen."</p>
                  <p>Full of musings at what they had seen, they took their way back to the
                     camp.</p>
                  <p>Old Lemple roused himself when they approached the camp.</p>
                  <p>"Boys, I am going to take this shining cross and this ere letter to the
                     General. That poor woman might a had some relations to care about her, and I
                     don't like keepin'it. Dumb Louis did enough kindness to me while he was

                  <p>The men agreed it would be best to do so.</p>
                  <p>The Confederate army were soon ready to march on towards Nashville. General
                     Hood pressed on after Schofield as fast as he could.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE STORM.</head>
                  <p>TWO months after Lee's surrender the Southern people began to react from the
                     shock, which, for a time, seemed to stupefy them, and were beginning to look
                     around now, and to make inquiries in regard to their future. The
                     widely-scattered families, separated so far during the war, commenced to
                     reunite themselves; people sought their old homes, their habitats, or at least
                     what was left of them,—in many instances, only dust and ashes remained to mark
                     the places where happy dwellings once stood. Mr. Laurie was returning to
                     Natchez with his daughter; he hoped soon to have Reginald and Lucia, Margaret
                     and Gerald, join him there. His house was destroyed; but he thought he could
                     procure some abode among his old friends, at least for a time. He had gone down
                     the railroad to Mobile, from the little town where he and Annie had found
                     refuge at the sacking of Atlanta. At Mobile he embarked on the Hesperus for the
                     two days' run across the Gulf to New Orleans. The steamer was crowded with all
                     sorts of passengers. After arranging their matters in their state-rooms, Annie
                     conducted her father to a quiet, retired seat on the deck, and sat down by him,
                     trying to amuse him by describing the motley assemblage scattered over the
                     deck. Many a careless glance of compassion and sympathy were cast towards them
                     by the gay people about. The blind man, with his long, white hair and serene
                     face, and the fragile—oh! so painfully fragile woman who sat beside him, with
                     an expression of fixed, unutterable sorrow, impressed on every line of her
                     speaking countenance. The deep eyes, so sunken and so sad; the mouth, so sweet,
                     and yet so hopeless in every line about it; and the complexion, thin, and
                     transparent, colorless as rice paper,—the soft, brown hair, so abundant and so
                     smooth, with long flakes of perfectly snow-white tresses scattered through its
                     flossy braids. It was well Mr. Laurie was blind—a look of pity filled every eye
                     that glanced on Annie Laurie; but she was smiling now as she conversed with her
                     father.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! ah! non! je nele veux! je ne le veux pas!" cried a child's voice near her.
                     Annie turned her head to see a beautiful, flaxen-haired girl of six years, who
                     was repulsing the proffered embrace of a gentleman in full Federal uniform; the
                     officer was coaxing her to let him kiss her.</p>
                  <p>"Non! non! moi, je suis Confedereé je ne vous embrasserai pas, jamais,
                     jamais!"</p>
                  <p>The child pushed him away from her with all her petty strength. The officer
                     laughed:</p>
                  <p>"Oh, you little rebel! but you will be glad to have this beautiful candy after
                     a while."</p>
                  <p>"Non! I sall not your candy eat. I sall not you kiss. I will kiss General
                     Lee—pas vous, pas vous."</p>
                  <p>Annie smiled at the child's vehement petulance. The little girl caught the
                     faint smile, turned towards Annie, looked at her steadily, then came to
                     her—with all the confidence of a beautiful, wayward child, she laid her hand on
                     Annie's knee, and looking up in her face, she said:</p>
                  <p>"You—you is Confedereé, néstee pas!"</p>
                  <p>"Mais oui, bien oui!" replied Annie, almost fervently; then tears rushed to her
                     eyes as she remembered what it had cost her being "Confedereé."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! vous parlez francais, mais c ést charmante! I git so tired of anglais,
                     toujours anglais."</p>
                  <p>Glad of a listener, the child chattered away like a little parrot; leaning on
                     Annie's knee, playing with her watch chain, she told her that her name was
                     "Vadine," and that she was going with her mamma, who was downstairs in the
                     state-room, to New Orleans, thence they were going "home à Paris;" that she was
                     glad to go away from this country, where the Yankees had whipped General
                     Lee."</p>
                  <p>"General Lee" seemed to be the idol of this very young lady's imagination.
                     "Vadine" had been in Secessia since she was<pb n="132-133"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000067"/> three years old, so she had acquired all its
                     political principles, as far as young ideas could soar. Perhaps her mother
                     thought it advisable to countenance the rampant rebel-ism of her six-year-old
                     Joan d'Arc.—At any rate. Vadine was ostentatiously rebellious, and very amusing
                     with her spright-liness and French gaiety. Attracted by Mr. Laurie's venerable
                     appearance, and his evident appreciation of her sallies of childish wit, which
                     a child recognizes instantly, and is always flattered by, Vadine soon deserted
                     Annie's lap for his, where she sat composedly, talking, prattling, coquetting
                     with her enemy the Federal officer, who rattled the corne of bon bons at her,
                     every now and then; but Vadine only replied by shaking her little clenched
                     fist, and making waves of light in her golden looks by the vehement vibration
                     of her fairy head. If he approached too near, she would clasp her arms around
                     Mr. Laurie's neck, bury her head in his bosom, as she cried out:</p>
                  <p>"Va t'en! Va t'en! Le ne vous Aimeai jamais, jamais!—á' cause de General
                     Lee."</p>
                  <p>At bed-time a maid came to seek her. Embracing Mr. Laurie and Annie warmly, she
                     said "Bon soir," and allowed herself to be carried off to her mamma.</p>
                  <p>"What an exquisite child!" exclaimed Mr. Laurie, "so full of spirit and
                     life!"</p>
                  <p>"She is very lovely," replied Annie.</p>
                  <p>They sat late on deck, the night was so clear and beautiful—though Annie felt
                     as if great congealed drops of blood fell one after another upon her heart, as
                     the cool, soft night wind played over her, and she looked out on the sparkling
                     phosphorescent sea.</p>
                  <p>How often she had sat gazing on this Gulf, with Harold by her side; his arm
                     around her, his kisses on her lips, and in her spirit the cry raged
                     unceasingly—</p>
                  <p>"Harold oh! my Harold!"</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie rose from her seat, as a gentleman approached Mr. Laurie, and
                     engaged him in conversation. She felt strangely oppressed and weary. The light
                     buzz of voices in cheerful talk around her jarred painfully on her over-strung
                     nerves. She leaned over the taffrail and looked out on the sea—clear and
                     rippling in the moon's rays—the long smooth billows gently swelling in
                     monotonous rhythm. Near her, leaned over the rail a young Confederate officer;
                     one arm carelessly embraced the wooden supports, the other long grey sleeve
                     fell empty from the shoulder. He too was looking out on the sea vaguely, as he
                     hummed in a low tone the Scotch ballad of "Annie Laurie."</p>
                  <p>Annie shivered as the low tones entered her ear. Involuntarily she put her hand
                     to loosen her neck riband; she felt choking. The last time she heard that song
                     Harold sung it, with his arm around her. She gasped for breath.</p>
                  <p>The young Confederate turned at the sound of the struggling breath, and saw the
                     pale face of the woman who clung with both hands to the rail. He was
                     frightened—</p>
                  <p>"Madame, are you ill? Can I aid you?"</p>
                  <p>Annie shook her head mournfully. For an instant she was unable to speak; then
                     she managed to say, in a trembling whisper—</p>
                  <p>"Please, don't sing that air yet, until I go away!"</p>
                  <p>"Of course not, said the officer. "I am very sorry I sang it, if it is so
                     painful to you. But standing here, thinking over everything, I couldn't but
                     remember my Colonel, who died at ——, in Virginia. I was the aid on service with
                     him: was riding by his side when we made a dash on some artillery. It was
                        <emph>his</emph> last charge, and cost me this right arm. As we rode along,
                     on the guns of the enemy, through his shut teeth, I heard him humming that
                     song, and the words of the last line were scarcely out of his lips before a
                     piece of shell struck him—dead! So when I think of him, I remember the song,
                     and so I sang it tonight."</p>
                  <p>"What was your Colonel's name?"</p>
                  <p>"Colonel Harold Ashton! We served in General Laurie's Division."</p>
                  <p>"I thought so."</p>
                  <p>"I did hear," continued the officer, "that the General had a sister, that
                     Colonel Ashton was devoted to; but one hears so many things! I have a ring here
                     I would like to give to some of Ashton's friends, if I could come across them.
                     I took it off his finger. It has his initials twisted with A—— L—— in it."</p>
                  <p>The officer held up his left hand. On the little finger glittered on amethyst
                     ring.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie held out her hand—</p>
                  <p>"Give it to me, sir, it is mine. I gave it to Harold Ashton. I should have been
                     his wife some day. I am Annie Laurie!"</p>
                  <p>The officer gazed into the speaking countenance of the woman by his side. He
                     read the truth in every line in her face. Drawing the ring from his finger, he
                     laid it in Annie's outstretched palm—</p>
                  <p>"Take it! Madame. I pray God to minister to grief such as yours!"</p>
                  <p>Annie took the ring, slipped it on her finger—</p>
                  <p>"Thanks," she murmured, and turned away to her father.</p>
                  <p>The Confederate looked after her silently, then turned again to the sea—</p>
                  <p>"Poor lady! poor lady! and poor country!" he muttered—" The dead are blessed,
                     are blessed!"</p>
                  <p>By midnight all was silent on the steamer. All sunk in deep repose except, the
                     officers and men on the watch. "The vessel sped along; the large engine
                     pulsating in great heavy breaths, rocking the steamer on the waves like a huge
                     cradle for the sleeping crew. Towards morning, however, the clouds began to
                     thicken; the wind grew fierce; changed its quarter, and veered round to the
                     south-west,—an ugly sign to a Gulf sailor.</p>
                  <p>The sky became black. Lightnings flashed and thunder roared above the sea. The
                     vessel began to pitch and toss and struggle with the scudding waves. The
                     captain was roused and came on deck. The vessel was made ready for a battle
                     with the storm. A hurricane was about to break upon her; one of those sudden,
                     unexpected, fearful storms, so frequent in the Gulf of Mexico—storms such as
                     washed away every vestige of habitation on Last Islands,—storms that seize
                     trees, houses, vessels, in their fearful breaths, and toss and play with them
                     as if they were made of feathers,—storms before whose might man sinks down
                     appalled, with a feeble cry for mercy to the God who alone can given them.</p>
                  <p>Such a tempest broke now over the illfated "Hersperus." In a little while every
                     passenger was up and dressed—all anxious—all helpless; some despairing women
                     began to weep and to pray—men to fold their arms and look desperate. The vessel
                     surged and groaned and tossed like a quivering, living thing! The captain, as
                     he saw the passengers-struggling up, crowding the deck, impeding the sailors at
                     work and exposing themselves to the danger of being washed into the sea by the
                     waves, which occasionally dashed clear over the vessel, as she rolled from side
                     to side, ploughing through the tempestuous waters, called out hoarsely through
                     his trumpet—</p>
                  <p>"Keep below, if you value your lives. I will do all man can to save you!"</p>
                  <p>Then the crowd struggled down again, and cowered back into the state-rooms and
                     cabins. Their fate depended now upon the engine. If they could only keep up the
                     steam, they might make headway against the storm—at least, be able to keep
                     anoat. But the "Hesperus" was very heavy amidships, and the ponderous engine
                     made the vessel shudder and groan and screech at every throb of its levers.</p>
                  <p>A heavy wave dashed across the steamer. The captain, with his trumpet in hand,
                     was carried off into the sea. The sailors cried aloud in dismay. The first mate
                     took command, but the men did not obey him so well as they had done the
                     captain.</p>
                  <p>The tempest grew blacker and blacker. All night, all day, they struggled
                     against it. On the approach of the deeper dark of the second night the men were
                     wearied. They began to cast glances towards the lifeboats. One after another
                     the passengers began to crowd the deck again,—this time with no rebuking voice.
                     Some followed this fate of the captain. The shrieks and wailing of women
                     mingled with the howling of the hurricane.</p>
                  <p>The vessel sprung a leak. The pumps were manned for an hour or so,—then the
                     sailors got hold of some liquor. The engineers stayed steadily at their post.
                     The pilot lashed himself to the wheel. The vessel reeled and rolled. The water
                     was rising in her hold. The sailors were, <emph>many</emph> of them,
                     intoxicated. The passengers were put at the pumps.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly a thrill ran through the vessel. A portion of the machinery had become
                     deranged—some flues collapsed. The engineers opened the valves, hastily, to
                     avoid explosion—a roar as if of expiring rage—the last effort of strength. The
                     steam rushed out of the pipes. The "Hesperus" lay a lifeless, helpless log, on
                     the terrible, tossing, mountainous waves.</p>
                  <p>A heavy sea swept over the deck. The one-armed Confederate lost his hold of the
                     low mast to which he was clinging, and was swept off on the wave. As he was
                     hurried past, the Federal officer, who had tried to tempt Vadine with
                     sugar-plums, reached out to catch him. But he missed his grasp, and only
                     involved himself in a common destruction. The great wave knocked him down, and
                     the former enemies, clasping each other like brothers, met their doom in that
                     fraternal embrace.</p>
                  <p>The mate called to get out all the boats. They were filled rapidly—everybody
                     pressing foremost. The mate took his stand, pistol in hand, by the
                     gangway—keeping back the sailors.</p>
                  <p>"Not a d——d man of you will get in until the women are safe."</p>
                  <p>Some men threw themselves overboard in their fight, and were drowned before
                     they could attain the boats. All the passengers were in the boats. The last
                     boat hung rocking, plunging by the ropes to the vessel. The mate had stepped in
                     himself into this one to give his hand to old Mr. Laurie, whom he carefully
                     selected to aid himself. Annie stood still, clinging to the taffrail; she saw
                     her father safely seated, and was about to give her hand to the mate to
                     descend, when she heard a child's voice from the cabin below:</p>
                  <p>"Ah, comme j'ai peur! O'est affreuse! Si noir, toute est noir. Maman, maman, ou
                     est vous!" little Vadine, separated from her mother, screamed aloud.</p>
                  <p>The child's cry, so shrill! rose above the storm. It reached the ears of the
                     mother, already in the boat, She rose to her feet and stretched out her arms
                     with a shriek; maternity asserted itself; but the sailors pushed her down
                     rudely, fearing she would capsize the already overloaded boat, "Keep quiet, d—n
                     you!"</p>
                  <p>Grace was a careless, but not an unfeeling<pb n="134-135"
                        xml:id="VAC6308-00000068"/> ing mother. She had not intended to desert her
                     little daughter. She had put the child in the nurse's arms, and commanded the
                     woman to follow her closely, when the passengers crowded up on the deck of the
                     vessel in order to get into the boats. It was dark and confused, the few lights
                     unsteady and flickering. Grace saw the woman immediately behind her as she
                     herself was assisted into the last boat. She supposed the nurse still retained
                     the child in her arms; but great peril makes some natures selfish. The maid had
                     put the frightened, half-awake child down upon a sofa in the cabin, and thought
                     only of saving her own life. Grace screamed vainly in hopeless despair now, as
                     the sailors forced her down into the bottom of the boat: "My child! My child!
                     My little child!"</p>
                  <p>The mate tried to spring back on the vessel, but he missed his footing, and the
                     sea swallowed him up. Annie Laurie called to the mother:</p>
                  <p>"I will try to save your child. Wait one moment—only one moment!"</p>
                  <p>Annie ran down the cabin steps. It was pitch dark; all the lights were knowcked
                     out by the tossing of the vessel.</p>
                  <p>"Vadine petite! Vadine ou est vous!"</p>
                  <p>"Ici, ici!" cried the child's voice.</p>
                  <p>Annie grouped her way to the spot, seized the warm, trembling child, clothed
                     only in her night-gown, in her arms, and hastened upon the deck; but it was to
                     see the boat already at a distance. The sailors had cut the ropes and freed her
                     from the struggling vessel, and were using every oar to keep her off and to
                     keep her afloat. Annie clasped the child closer in her arms, and drooped her
                     head over its fair young face.</p>
                  <p>"My poor little Vadine, they have forsaken us!"</p>
                  <p>The child cried, and clung to Annie's neck.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, c'est affrense! Je ne veux pas mourir! Sauvez moi, sauvez moi!"</p>
                  <p>"Will," sighed Annie, "be quiet. I will try when the daylight comes. Soyez
                     tranquille, mon enfant, le bon Dieu vous aime toujours."</p>
                  <p>Annie took the child back into the cabin and lay down on a sofa, with Vadine in
                     her arms, and the storm raged on. She felt the vessel sinking deeper and deeper
                     as it became more and more water-looked, rolling heavily and more heavily,—a
                     huge, unvi-talized, stupid mass on the foaming, yeasty waves.</p>
                  <p>Towards daylight she fancied the storm abating somewhat,—certainly the wind was
                     not so fierce in its whistlings, the rain was more constant, the flashes of
                     lightning rarer, the thunder more distant in its peals. Hour after hour
                     passed—Vadine lay nestled close to Annie, in silence. The little thing,
                     comforted by Annie's presence, had lost all fear of the raging elements, and
                     had fallen asleep in the simple trust of childhood.</p>

                  <p>DAY broke. The vessel surged on, floated by the tide. At last through the murky
                     clouds came a rift; the sun—the blessed sun—shone out, at first dimly,
                     struggling through the dense bank of grey clouds which covered the threatening
                     sky, then, asserting its power more ardently, it shone out clearly, decidedly;
                     the rain lessened, the lightnings fled, the thunder faded away in low
                     mutterings; the sea still swelled with the remembrance of the struggle of the
                     night, but the waves no longer dashed and raved around the fast settling
                     steamer,—settling down now, Annie felt it,—for a plunge into the depths of the
                     gloomy waters. Rousing Vadine, Annie took her by the hand and went up on the
                     deck. The vessel had drifted far before the wind during the night; no sign of
                     the boats anywhere; but as Annie looked around her she seemed to recognize
                     dimly the lines of the shore, now clearly visible a few miles off. The tide had
                     set in towards the shore, but Annie did not think the steamer would live to
                     reach it. It seemed to her as if a few minutes would end its career. Her
                     decisions were quickly made. Seating Vadine on a light wooden bench, or settle,
                     still fastened securely to the deck, she went below. She soon returned with a
                     blanket, a rope, a hatchet, a couple of loaves of bread, a bottle of water, and
                     a sailor's tarpaulin, she had found. With the hatchet she cut the settle loose
                     from the deck, then taking Vadine in her arms, she kissed her again and
                     again.</p>
                  <p>"Little Vadine, now I am going to save you. I am going to wrap you up in this
                     blanket, and tie you on this bench, and you will float to the beautiful shore
                     yonder on your own little boat. You need not be afraid. See! I am going to put
                     this bread and this water where you can reach it, and cover you and it, too,
                     all up with this tarpaulin to keep you dry and comfortable; and you will float
                     off like Moses in his bulrush ark. You need not be afraid, you can't sink, and
                     the good God will watch over you, darling."</p>
                  <p>"I am not afraid," replied the child, smiling; "but you, Annie, will you have
                     an ark, too? Are you coming, too?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, if the good God will let me. But now let me wrap you up, and put you in
                     your pretty cradle."</p>
                  <p>The child, pleased at the thought, willingly extended herself on the light
                     settle, which Annie had drawn to the side of the vessel close to the open
                     gangway. Annie fastened the child securely to the bench, arranged the bread and
                     the water, and, taking a piece of stick she had provided, she tied her white
                     handkerchief upon the end, and attached the stick to the bench, so that it
                     projected far above it.</p>
                  <p>"That's a pretty white flag for your boat," she said to Vadine.</p>
                  <p>After all was arranged, Annie kissed the child warmly again.</p>
                  <p>"Now, little Vadine, pray to our Father."</p>
                  <p>Saying this, Annie gently lowered the bench with its precious freight into the
                     sea. Vadine screamed with sudden fear as it went slowly down on the water; but
                     Annie stood smiling on the deck, bending over towards her.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be frightened, my darling. Pray to the good God, and his beautiful holy
                     angels will take care of you."</p>
                  <p>Vadine, encouraged thus, smiled back at Annie. She believed her, trusted in
                     her, with a child's faith.</p>
                  <p>Her bench floated on the waves now. Putting her hands together she looked
                     obediently up to heaven as she lay, and begun to chant, "Notre Pere daus le
                     ciel, que ton nom soit sanctifie." Annie Laurie cut the ropes which still held
                     the frail ark to the vessel, and the child floated off towards the shore on the
                     tide, now running in. The ark seemed to direct itself voluntarily thither. So
                     far as her little tender voice could be heard, Annie listened, leaning over the
                     side of the vessel, to the words of the chanted prayer from the sinless
                     lips.</p>
                  <p>As the white flag faded into a mere speck on the water, but still going
                     steadily towards the shore, Annie Laurie fell upon her knees in a burst of
                     tears, and with uplifted hands she prayed:</p>
                  <p>"Save her, save her, oh, my Father! And as for me—que ta volonté soit
                     faité"</p>
                  <p>Annie used the words as they fell from Vadine's lips almost unconsciously. They
                     were the last human words that ever reached her ears.</p>
                  <p>The sea was nearly calm now, the waves ran sparkling one after another, though
                     an occasional wreath of churned foam showed upon their crests, and testified to
                     the tempest of the night. The white-caps ran merrily along. The half-submerged
                     vessel lay lifelessly, making a stubborn, stolid resistance to the now playful
                     waves. Annie took a piece of rope and lashed herself to a spare spar, laying
                     herself down alongside of it. <emph>This</emph> act she considered her duty to
                     her God, her father, and herself. She would give herself <emph>every</emph>
                     chance for life. After she had tied herself firmly to the spar, she folded her
                     arms over her head, and lay looking up into the clear blue sky, with its flocks
                     of white scudding clouds. She thought of all her life, of her father, of
                     Reginald, of Gerald, and Margaret, and of Harold, her well-beloved. Tears
                     rolled slowly down her cheeks; she did not attempt to wipe them off. Suddenly
                     she felt the vessel quiver. As a seventh wave struck her side, the Hesperus
                     pitched forward, backward, then, with a rush, plunged down into the sea, making
                     a whirlpool as she went into the depths.</p>
                  <p>Annie was conscious of struggling, gasping, in the water, then the spar to
                     which she was lashed rose to the surface, and began to whirl round and round in
                     the eddy formed by the sinking steamer. Annie was dizzy from the rapid circular
                     motion, half-drowned, mazed, and almost insensible, but free from pain. The sun
                     shone clear and bright upon her half-closed eyes. Instinctively she had clasped
                     her arms about the spar to which she was fastened, and her head rested upon it,
                     her long hair spread floating out on the waves, sometimes surging over her face
                     and blinding her already dim sight with its wet mesh. A troop of white seagulls
                     flew over her with shrill cries. Annie opened her eyes with a start. Half
                     conscious, she followed the white birds with her wandering brain and fading
                     vision. To her they assumed the fantastic form of a woman floating by with a
                     long, long, white robe trailing behind her. The woman's head was bowed over her
                     breast, and there, cradled in her arms in the attitude of Thorswaldsen's
                     "Night," Annie fancied she saw a little child. At one moment the golden curls
                     of Vadine shone on the child's head, then the dark straight hair of an Indian
                     child, and Annie heard the far-off singing of Lucia Vail, singing her lullaby.
                     Then the music changed, and mother and child floated off, solemnly chanting the
                     words of the Lord's prayer, "Que ta volouté" soit faité! Que ta volonté soit
                     faité!"</p>
                  <p>The spar whirled round more and more slowly, in wider, larger circlings. Now
                     suddenly rose from out the sea a piece of the broken cabin of the submerged
                     vessel, all tangled with ropes and cordage. Of greater weight and swifter
                     momentum, this mass of broken framework whirled on after the spar to which
                     Annie still clung. Swiftcr, swifter, it came after, like a relentless pursuing
                     béagle, chasing the spar around in this fearful death waltz. Annie Laurie was
                     only partly conscious; deep exhaustion and painless lethargy wrapt her senses
                     almost in oblivion. On, on, rapidly swept the mass; it reached her; a strong
                     wave threw it forcibly, <emph>violently</emph> forward. With a dull thump it
                     struck the spar,—struck Annie Laurie on the neck. An instant of pain opened for
                     her an immortality of joy. The gentle head sunk off the spar, borne back by the
                     weight of lifeless hair. The waves tossed the white hands, and the amethyst
                     ring sparkled in the sun-rays. The cordage on the framework surged, sunk, and
                     rose around Annie Laurie, until<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6308-00000069"/> it
                     washed and spread under her. It insinuated itself more and more. It gradually
                     lifted her up with the spar to which she was fastened. The mass of débris clung
                     closer together. Gently, gently, the poor senseless clay was raised out of the
                     water, the debris sustaining it as a raft might. The waves dashed on to the
                     shore, running with grey-hound swiftness; the sunlight was glorious over land
                     and over sea—the clear "bright shining after the rain"; Nature rang all her
                     joy-bells after a fearful strife.</p>

                  <p>THE day after the storm, Baptiste went out as usual with his boat, after fish.
                     The war had passed almost harmlessly over the inmates of the fisherman's
                     cottage, at Pass Christian. The village had escaped intact. Baptiste was too
                     old for the army. He knew little of the contest, still less of the reasons for
                     fighting on either side. Creole entirely in feeling and habits, he cared very
                     little about politics. He had suffered privation for a while, so long as he was
                     not allowed to take his fish to the city to sell during the continuance of the
                     blockade of New Orleans; but he had managed by Marie's strict economy to live
                     through those evil days, and he was now, happy as ever, a simple, contented
                     fisherman. Marie, with quicker sensibility and brighter intellect, sympathized
                     warmly with the South, but above all, she never ceased to bemoan, the long,
                     long absence of her good friends, the Laurie family, from their summer home,
                     and she rejoiced to have the war ended, that she might hope for their return.
                     Baptiste did not go far out that day; Marie was surprised to see him return at
                     noon. She knew the shape of his sail, and watched it coming into the wharf.</p>
                  <p>"Baptiste has had a good day," she said to her son. Courtenay, as he stood by
                     her side, on their vine-clad porch.</p>
                  <p>Courtenay started off in a run to meet his father. Marie watched her husband
                     get out, make his boat fast to the pier; then, instead of lifting out his
                     basket of fish, hoisting it on his head, as usual, she saw him stoop down into
                     the boat, take a bundle in her arms, and turn his steps towards the cottage,
                     bearing his burden carefully. She saw Courtenay stop, and turn suddenly. After
                     exchanging a word with his father, the boy ran back to her. Marie went out to
                     meet them. Courtenay sprang along before his father.</p>
                  <p>"Ma mere, ma mere, le pere á trouvé une jolie petite fille. La, sur la
                     mer!"</p>
                  <p>Baptiste came up smiling.</p>
                  <p>"See, Marie, the poor child! I found her floating in the sea, tied to a little
                     bench, saved from a vessel wrecked in the storm. Take her, and comfort her,
                     poor little thing—she is frightened, and so weary!"</p>
                  <p>Marie opened wide her motherly arms, the little golden-haired girl clung to
                     her. The sound of the familiar French was consoling to her ear.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! jai faim! et je suis tellement, fatigué, tellement. O'est le bon Dieuqui
                     mé sauveé, jai prieé tant á lui, tant."</p>
                  <p>Marie kissed the child, who was trembling and weak from exposure and hunger.
                     She had not had the sense or presence of mind to eat the bread and drink the
                     water Annie Laurie had put by her, on the bench.</p>
                  <p>While they hurried along, Baptiste told Marie how he had discovered the child,
                     about two miles out from the shore. He was attracted by the sight of a little,
                     white flag, floating over the sea; he had steered for it, and found the child
                     fastened to the bench, so carefully wrapped up in the tarpaulin, that she was
                     not even wetted, except her hair, by the spray.</p>
                  <p>Marie fed the child with warm milk and bread; she took off the fine night
                     clothes, put one of her own child's coarse, clean shirts upon her—after bathing
                     the weary little limbs, and chafing with her hands the stiffness from out them,
                     caused by the constrained position. The child's blue eyes drooped wearily; but
                     she said, before she would go to sleep:</p>
                  <p>"Maintenant que le bon Dieu mà sauveé, il faut prier pour maman, et pour Annie,
                     qui viendra <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bientot.</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>Slipping from Marie's lap, she knelt and prayed aloud for these trio; two she
                     suffered Marie to put her in the bed, and she sunk readily into profound,
                     refreshing slumber. The sun went down, and the cool, dark night came with its
                     wing of healing spread over the earth. Little Vadine woke only for her supper
                     of milk and bread; and again she slept. The little pale cheeks flushed into
                     renewed health under the balmy slumber. Marie bent above her and kissed the
                     lovely child, as she drew the clean sheet carefully over her bare
                     shoulders.</p>
                  <p>"She reminds me of Marguerite—the merry mischief, Marguerite," she said to
                     Baptiste. "Ah! where are they? <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Nos bons amis!</foreign>
                     Will they <emph>never</emph> return?"</p>
                  <p>Early the next day, Baptiste had gone out with his boat to fish.</p>
                  <p>Marie procured some clothes from a kind neighbor that would fit Vadine. Her own
                     little girl was younger and smaller, so that her garments would not answer for
                     the stranger. The child was still weak from her great fright and exposure, but
                     well in other respects: too languid, however, to do more than sit in the small
                     rocking chair on the shady porch and play with the doll Margaret had sent years
                     ago to Marie's little daughter. Marie went out into her garden and came back
                     with her hands full of roses and oleanders.</p>
                  <p>"There," she said to Vadine, "you will make a couronne for yourself and one for
                     Mamie," (Marie's little daughter.)</p>
                  <p>The child seized the flowers with avidity, and was directly interested in
                     forming the "couronnes," weaving the bright blossoms together with instinctive
                     taste, calling upon Marie every minute to admire her handiwork. She had begun
                     to yearn for her "Maman" and to wonder why "Annie" did not come as she
                     promised. She was restless.</p>
                  <p>"One couronne for Maman," she said to Marie, "that shall be lovely pink
                     oleanders, so sweet; and one couronne for Annie, that shall be all white, all
                     white, of these roses, so pale as she!"</p>
                  <p>Marie asked her many questions about this "Annie," as well as of her "Maman,"
                     but obtained very little satisfactory information. "Maman" was some great lady,
                     she thought from the child's artless description; and "<emph>Annie</emph>" was
                     the person who had tied Vadine on the wooden settle, and put her in the sea,
                     trusting the child "to God and the holy angels."</p>
                  <p>The child expected confidently that "Annie" would come "soon," as she
                        "<emph>promised.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Courtenay ran off to the beach, ostensibly to gather shells for Vadine—really
                     to wade and paddle in the shallow water, as the tide was going out: it was
                     great fun for the stout, bare-legged boy.</p>
                  <p>Vadine had finished her crowns and laid them carefully on a table, refusing to
                     adorn herself with either. Marie was giving a luncheon of conserves and bread
                     to the two little girls, seeing the flowers interested them no longer.</p>
                  <p>"Now you make une petite there in the shade of the vines, for you and
                     Mamie."</p>
                  <p>At this moment Courtenay came running towards the house, his eyes and mouth
                     widely stretched, as if with fear. He rushed into the porch and grasped his
                     mother's gown, trembling with excitement.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, ma mère, ma mère, voila uné pauvre dame, la, sor lé sable, toute noyeé,
                     toute morte!"</p>
                  <p>Marie threw her apron over her head.</p>
                  <p>"Venez, montrez moi!"</p>
                  <p>Courtenay ran along by his mother's side, still clinging to her skirts with one
                     hand, as if he feared to let go his hold of his protectress. Death was strange
                     and new to the boy—he had never seen it in humanity.</p>
                  <p>"You will have to come out here far on the sands, to the edge of the water,
                     most to the pier's end," Courtenay said.</p>
                  <p>Marie followed his directions—waded a short distance in the shallow water. It
                     was noon—the tide was well out. On a pile of mingled frame-work and cordage,
                     with the shallow waves rippling over her face, lay Annie Laurie. Marie gave a
                     cry of grief and recognition. In an instant her handkerchief was torn from her
                     head, and her dark hair scattered by handfuls on the air, in the extravagance
                     of her French demonstrative nature.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! mon Dieu! ah, mon Dieu! Ah, sainte Mariè! sainte vierge! Mere de Dieu!
                     c'est <emph>elle!</emph> c'est <emph>elle!</emph>" Sinking down on her knees in
                     the water. Marie lifted the poor head out of the sand and laid it on her
                     knees.</p>
                  <p>"Run, my child! run, my child! Seek the neibors!—bring me a knife to cut these
                     cords! Oh, run, my child—run, my child—c'est elle! c'est elle! Mlle Annie, ma
                     chere Mlle Annie! oh, Dieu de misericorde!"</p>
                  <p>Courtenay flew to obey his mother's orders. In an incredibly brief space
                     several men and women surrounded the weeping Marie. The remains of Annie Laurie
                     were cut loose from the raft, and the sorrowful procession turned to the
                     cottage.</p>
                  <p>Little Vadine met them at the gate. She recognized the body borne by two men.
                     She clapped her hands and began to dance joyfully.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, elle est venue, <emph>enfin,</emph> elle est venue! Maman viendra aussi
                     apres quelque temps!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, pauvre enfant!" said the weeping Marie. "Oui, elle <emph>est</emph> venue,
                     mais Helas! Helas! elle est toute, toute morte! Ah, mon Dieu! que o'est
                     affrense—terrible! cette, mer si cruelle! si cruelle—Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!"</p>
                  <p>Physicians were summoned, but Annie was quite dead. So poor Marie habited the
                     body for the grave, and laid little Vadine's white rose crown upon the pale,
                     white hands, so meekly folded over the quiet breast.</p>
                  <p>Annie Laurie was buried the next day in the flower garden of her father's
                     house.</p>
                  <p>Harold slept on the battle-field in Virginia. But surely their spirits were no
                     longer divided. It was better so for both, perhaps. God knows <emph>best
                        always!</emph>"</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE FINALE.</head>
                  <p>THE boat containing Mr. Laurie and Vadine's mother was picked up by a passing
                     steamer. The passengers were conveyed to New Orleans. Mr. Laurie learned the
                     fate of his daughter, and Vadine's safety, through Dr. Rock, who had been
                     sought out by Baptiste, who came to consult his friend, the doctor, about the
                     child.</p>
                  <pb n="138" xml:id="VAC6308-00000070"/>
                  <p>Vadine was restored to her mother—the fisherman's family being liberally
                     rewarded.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Laurie pined away after his daughter's death. Not all the care lavished on
                     him by his other children, and the professor, and Miss Smith, could console
                     him. He lived but a short while.</p>
                  <p>After his death, Gerald and Margaret, Reginald and Lucia, returned to
                     England.</p>
                  <p>The professor and Miss Smith were married, and followed after them very
                     soon.</p>
                  <p>Reginald and Lucia were established at Vail Court, to the great joy of Mr.
                     Vail, who, after employing the heralds to trace up Reginald's genealogy,
                     declared him his rightful heir, according to blood, and made Lucia very happy
                     by this procedure, which disinherited <emph>her</emph> personally. So Reginald
                     was naturalized by act of parliament in Great Britain.</p>
                  <p>Sir Gerald Dare profited greatly by his experiences, and made an admirable
                     land-owner and sensible English nobleman. If he had any great weakness, it was
                     his open pride in and devotion to his wife.</p>
                  <p>Lady Dare was the toast of the county, and the benefactress of all the poor
                     about her.</p>
                  <p>Lizzie Green and her ever faithful Jim Dodd were married. Lady Dare gave them a
                     grand wedding, and a cottage to live in, which Lucia stocked bountifully with
                     all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life.</p>
                  <p>Olive branches are springing up in both houses. Little Annie Laurie already
                     notices her cousin, Hugh Dare, who is a year older, and boasts of being a
                     Canadian by birth.</p>
                  <p>The professor and Mrs. Liebermann have a home near the Hurst. The professor
                     soon established another laboratory, and set up anew his retorts, beginning
                     once more his efforts and experiments to create the "Actinii Crossii," and
                     prove the truth of the development theory; but he has not succeeded yet!</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Liebermann crotchets all sorts of articles for Margaret's and Lucia's
                     children.</p>
                  <p>The professor occasionally makes a short trip to the continent, to visit and
                     commune with his scientific brethren. On one of these occasions, being in
                     Russia, he met accidentally, at the court of the Czar, the still beautiful
                     Princess Roskopff and her young daughter, Vadine. The friend who accompanied
                     narrated the very romantic history of Madame and Mademoiselle Roskopff, who had
                     been shipwrecked once in the Gulf of Mexico, where Vadine had been saved by an
                     American lady.</p>
                  <p>The professor looked with emotion on the fair young child, so intimately
                     associated with Annie Laurie.</p>
                  <p>The friend went on to say, these circumstances becoming known to the Czar, he
                     had generously bestowed on the saved child two-thirds of Prince Roskopff's vast
                     estates, and made also a liberal allowance to the mother.</p>
                  <p>They were great favorites at court. Madame de Roskopff was extremely beautiful
                     yet, but had one defect—her right hand and arm were covered with ugly scars
                     from a burn.</p>
                  <p>Edward Morris fortunately had been in the habit of shipping his cotton crop to
                     England for years previous to the war, so at its close, when his estate was
                     confiscated, he still had a comfortable fortune left in his Liverpool
                     merchant's hands. He established himself, en garçon, in Paris, and lived a very
                     gay, if not profitable, life. Finding himself in St. Petersburg on a gala day,
                     he met, accidentally, a lady, who, in spite of the change produced by the tall
                     coiffure of the Russian court-dress, made him spring forward with the sudden
                     exclamation, as she passed by, of, "Madame Rozanne! est il, possible?"</p>
                  <p>But the lady swept by him with a cold stare of non-recognition that forced him
                     to retreat as hurriedly as he had rushed forward to greet her.</p>
                  <p>"Qui est donc cette dame?" he asked. "Mais c'est, la belle Princess de
                     Roskopff, veuve et bien riche! Aussi elle n'aime pas les Americains! vous ne
                     pouvez point vous flatter de l'esperance de le connaitre, jamais! Elle rejette
                     absolument la connaissance de tous vos compatriotes! Il faut I'admirer a la
                     distance!"</p>
                  <p>"Et pourquoi?"</p>
                  <p>"Parceque voyageante, elle a soufferte le naufrage au côte de l'Amerique, et
                     elle tiente en degout même le nom de ce pays! C'est une vraie caprice! Mais on
                     pardonne toutes folies à une si charmante dame!"</p>
                  <p>"Nevertheless, <emph>it is</emph> Madame Rozanne, <emph>the spy,</emph>"
                     thought Morris; but as it no longer concerned him, he kept his knowledge to
                     himself. Ainsi va le monde!</p>
