It was very evident tha't the robber&#xD;
was no stranger in the house into whie.&#xD;

W\ithou~tt he-itattiug, he proceeded&#xD;
down a long narrow passage, up a light&#xD;
of stone steps leading to a cellar.&#xD;
Thus far all was dark and silent,&#xD;
lie knocked in a peculiar way at what&#xD;
seemed to be a brick wall, but was in&#xD;
reality a door.&#xD;
Responsive to his sum'mous a small&#xD;
trap flew open close to his head, and a&#xD;

extremely drunken   pot-man, with&#xD;
elaborate caution and an outrageous I&#xD;

handsomely attired mea of v:ins'o&#xD;

They were engaged in what seemed&#xD;
to be a drinking bout of a formidable&#xD;
character, for the table was crowded&#xD;
with punch bowls, bottles, deeantera&#xD;
and glasses, whilst the "'deai amn'&#xD;
strewed the poor in every direction,&#xD;
A great burly red-faced man was on&#xD;
his legs, when Ralph entered, singing a&#xD;
song, in :which the company joined&#xD;
vociferously..&#xD;
At sight of Ralph, however, he sud.&#xD;
tdenly stopped, and in a dead since&#xD;
every one in the room turned to look at&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" Why, mercy me !" cried one of the&#xD;
ladies, a handsome brunette with great&#xD;
eyes, and beautiful white shoulders she&#xD;
was not at all niggardly in displaying.&#xD;
"Why, mercy me, , it's the Pretty&#xD;

ie certainly was in a ragged eon-&#xD;
dition, smeared' with mud and blood,&#xD;
and his garments saturated with water.&#xD;
But yet iit was impossible, even under&#xD;
these disadvantageous circumstances,&#xD;
to disguise the exquisite symmetry of&#xD;
his form, and the remarkable beauty of&#xD;
his face, round which, contrary to the&#xD;
fahion of the day, lie wore his own&#xD;
golden hair in clustering curls.&#xD;
It was a- very youthful face, with&#xD;
delicate features, clear blue eyes,-red&#xD;
pouting lips and dazzling white teeth.&#xD;
One could not help thinking that it&#xD;
was pretty enough for a woman's.&#xD;
His slender figure, tot, though well&#xD;
knit and muscular, appeared far too&#xD;
slight for the deeds of daring bravery&#xD;
which it was certain Red Ralph was the&#xD;
hero of.&#xD;
No wonder that he was called th&#xD;
Pretty Captain, and no wonder that al&#xD;
the ladies were in love with him, an&#xD;
that his reputation for gallantry, al&#xD;
though so young, was the town's talk.&#xD;
Not a fault, physically, did he seem t&#xD;
possess, allowing that the beauty of hi&#xD;
face was none the worse for being th&#xD;
beauty of a girl instead of a man-no&#xD;
a fault, save one-one dreadful blemis&#xD;
in his hand.&#xD;
His right hand, back and palm, fir&#xD;
gera, nails, and wrist, were blood red.&#xD;
A terrible hand it was, when unco&#xD;
ered, which made you'shudder to loo&#xD;
at it.&#xD;
A strange mystery, too, overhanging&#xD;
it, which no persuasion ever induced i&#xD;
owner to reveal the particulars of.&#xD;
This circumstance caused our hero f&#xD;
be called REn RALPH.&#xD;
"What on earth have you been d&#xD;

"It was he who twitted me the othe.&#xD;

said that I had a great reputation for&#xD;
robberies, and in reality I did nothing."&#xD;
"Don't you; what does he do ."&#xD;

work. The doctor lived with his wife,&#xD;

s to the servant, and got her out of the&#xD;

t her, all in half-a-dozen hours."&#xD;
th "Bravo, captain !"&#xD;
"Then I dressed myself as porter ;&#xD;

and got into the house. I soon packed.&#xD;

"That was awkward, captain."&#xD;
to "Very, but I explained, a gentleman&#xD;

"The wrong bed ?"&#xD;
"Yes, the son's bed. I had of course&#xD;
lit the bet, but I wasn't going to be&#xD;
beaten so easily ; I bet him double or&#xD;
quits that I would take that bed back&#xD;
and bring away the other."&#xD;
"Ha! hai ha !"&#xD;
" ravo, captain !"&#xD;
"How did you manage ?"&#xD;
"I managed worse than ever, for I&#xD;
had had a good deal tO drink and wasn't&#xD;
quite myself, and when I had wasnt&#xD;

"Well "&#xD;
"He'll have a handsome sum with&#xD;
him in his carriage, of which we might&#xD;

tinetly audible.&#xD;
d A dark chocolate-colored traveling&#xD;
I ,coach came in view, drawn by four&#xD;
a horses, the =postboys on the leaders&#xD;
loudly-cracking their whips.&#xD;
But the rope stretched across the&#xD;

One of the leaders blundered over it,&#xD;
the other stumbled and fell.&#xD;

ploughedlthe mud with their noses.&#xD;
The wheelers began to plunge and'&#xD;
lick furiously.&#xD;
The servant in =the rumble thumped&#xD;
his head violently ,uponthe top of the&#xD;
coach, and its inmates cried oft in&#xD;
alarm and let down the windows.&#xD;
A very red-and puffy face appeared&#xD;
upon the left-hand side,: into which,&#xD;
within an inch of his nose end, was in&#xD;

with all the speed of which h hig&#xD;

Ever and anon the moon was obscured&#xD;
by dense masses of floating clouds, and&#xD;
oftentimes the robber urged on his wild&#xD;
career in pitchy darkness.&#xD;
Vaulting over a hedge and ditch&#xD;
which bounded the market garden, he -&#xD;
found himself now iu the fields beyond,&#xD;
the gro d of which was horribly&#xD;
uneven; and compelled him to slacken&#xD;
his sped.&#xD;
I is pursuers' voices were distinctly&#xD;
audible.&#xD;
They had followed him across the&#xD;
garden. They had reached the hedge,&#xD;
and some had sprung over into the&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
A broad expanse of country spread&#xD;
forth before him.&#xD;
A broad green field, smooth as a lawn,&#xD;
lay just beyond the rugged ridged of&#xD;
ground over which he had been flound-&#xD;
ering.&#xD;
Without waiting for a moment to look&#xD;
after his foes, he set spurs to his horse's&#xD;
sides and dashed onward.&#xD;
With a yell they followed in pursuit&#xD;
'-.with a clump, clump, which seemed&#xD;
to shake the earth lik. the reverbera-&#xD;
ions of an earthquake.&#xD;
Loud echoed their voices in the clear&#xD;
bight air, as they urged their horses on-&#xD;
ward in the exciting chase.&#xD;
Fleet as the wind then lied the high-&#xD;
wayman.&#xD;
His faithful black mare   strained.&#xD;
every muscleand sinew to distance her&#xD;
pursuers.&#xD;
On! On !--'Twas a race for life.&#xD;
Bat what was that which at some&#xD;
:fifty yarde' distance spread a black&#xD;
streak across the green sward he was&#xD;
traversing?                        [I&#xD;
Straining his eyes he endeavored tot&#xD;
make out the nature of this object r&#xD;
which puzzled him.                  t&#xD;
"It must be water,"he said to him-&#xD;
self. "If so, we can swim through it. h&#xD;
But is it water l-ah !"             t&#xD;
At this moment was the moon again&#xD;
obscured bg clouds, and all before him  t&#xD;
plunged into darkness.              C&#xD;
In dread uncertainty of what might&#xD;
be in store for him he galloped forward. s&#xD;
He dared not have paused.         b&#xD;
His pursuers was still-following in&#xD;
full cry.f&#xD;
They were rapidly gaining on him.  w&#xD;
Their loud voices rang in his ears,.  s&#xD;
Within half a dozen yards of the w&#xD;
dark object, the moon again came forth&#xD;
from behind the clouds.r&#xD;

He   could  searely calenlate the    -&#xD;

was in the limits of possibility for him&#xD;

It required not the aid of his.spurs to&#xD;
urge on the faithful creature he bestrod e&#xD;
She seemed to know that all depends&amp;amp;&#xD;
on her.&#xD;
On she rushed like the wind.&#xD;
Then gathered her strength for th+&#xD;
fearful leap.-&#xD;
Again was the moon obscured.&#xD;
Again did the pitchy darkness cover&#xD;
the caith.   "&#xD;
She sprang o&amp;amp;t into the dense eh&#xD;

The robber felt her body quivei&#xD;

An awlul moment followed.&#xD;
In which his heart seemed to cease   s&#xD;
beat.&#xD;
Involuntarily  his knees tightened&#xD;
upon the saddle - his fingers claspe&#xD;
he reins like a vice.&#xD;
His eyes dilated ; his teeth clenched&#xD;

ho mare's feet rested on the edge of thi&#xD;

The horse fought frantically fir a ,&#xD;

a deep groan heavily to the ground.&#xD;
He shook himself free, sprang to his&#xD;
feet, and the next moment Was kneeling&#xD;
at her head.&#xD;
"Poor Nelly," he said, in deep sym-&#xD;
pathy and fast-gathering alarm. "What&#xD;

He placed his hand upon the hers's&#xD;

Then, seeing that the highwayman&#xD;
was in a fair way of escaping scot-free,&#xD;
they sent a shower of ballets ator him.&#xD;
The murderous lead, however, rattled&#xD;
harmlessly around au Ralph galloped&#xD;
onwards, every stride of his brave&#xD;
steed lengthening the distance between&#xD;
them.&#xD;
lie had crossed *e Aeld now, and&#xD;
taking the stone wall beyond in a fly-&#xD;
ing leap, found himself in a country&#xD;
lune with hedges on either aide.&#xD;
The shouts of the police still rang in&#xD;
his cars, and as he knew not whither the&#xD;
lane might lead him, instead of turning&#xD;
either to the iightor left, he'leaped one&#xD;
of the hedges, and galloped on again&#xD;
in a northerly direction, taking the&#xD;
routo s well as he could judge to&#xD;

A horrible wound gaped hideously,&#xD;
from which her heart's blood had ebbed&#xD;

Thus, then, she miserably perished&#xD;

In the track of the hua baek and&#xD;
his beautiful guide, the two gamekeep-.&#xD;
ers stealthily followed.&#xD;
Silently and cautiously they ap-&#xD;
proached the Old flail, within the walls&#xD;
of which, e'er dawn of day, a iarful&#xD;
tragedy was about to be enacted.&#xD;
' A deed  of black and   darnashli&#xD;
treachery.&#xD;
A cruel wrong, an outrage perpetra-&#xD;
ted upon one so young, beautiful, and&#xD;
innocent--friendless and defenceless&#xD;
In the hands of her cold-blooded mother-&#xD;
in law and her monstrous accomplice.&#xD;
Helpless to his doonrwas carried Red&#xD;
Ral ph.&#xD;
The prophecy of the old hag at the&#xD;
boozing-ken had so far come true.&#xD;
Already had he been brought face to&#xD;
face with a beautiful fiefd - already&#xD;
had he fallen into her snares.&#xD;
It yet remained to be seen whether&#xD;
or not in the fulness of time she would&#xD;
drag him to the scaffold.&#xD;
Certain was it, however, that from&#xD;
the earliest time a dark and terrible&#xD;
curse had hung over his race.&#xD;
Through more than four generations&#xD;
had his fore-fathers, once amongst the&#xD;
greatest and most noble in the land,&#xD;
rendered the name monstrous among&#xD;
men by their foul deeds of blood and&#xD;
horror.&#xD;
.   ,  .  .&#xD;
Upon him, Ralpi, the last of a&#xD;
doomed house, the curse lay heavier&#xD;
than upon any other.&#xD;
Also the memory of a fathers violent&#xD;

Tes,'sure en4gh, a sarse hung ori&#xD;
him, and Fate was pointing new to the&#xD;
road by which he must travel to the&#xD;
end.&#xD;
The hunchback bore him onwards by&#xD;
the chestnut avenue and through a&#xD;
small plantation, to where, irk a high&#xD;
red-brick moss-grown wall, they eame&#xD;
to a small-door, scarcely discernible for&#xD;
the taogled mass of blackberries ansId&#xD;
briars }rowing across it.&#xD;
To a casual observer it \would have&#xD;
appeared that the door-way had been&#xD;
for ma by years in disse, for it was&#xD;
green with damp, and the bushes in&#xD;
front almost choked it -p.&#xD;
But the' lady car flly drew the&#xD;
creeping plants on one side, and apply-&#xD;
ing to the lock a small key which she&#xD;
carried, without any difficulty effected&#xD;
an entrance.&#xD;
The hunchback having carried the&#xD;
highwayman through into the garden&#xD;
beyond, she then carefully replaced the&#xD;
bushes, so that it would have been very&#xD;
difficult to have told that they had ever&#xD;
been moved, and, following her com-&#xD;
panion, locked the door again behind&#xD;
her.&#xD;
They then made their way through&#xD;
another plantation, crossed another&#xD;
large old - fasrodoned garden, in the&#xD;
midst of which stood a great- sombre&#xD;
mansion, and let themselves in -at a&#xD;
side door.&#xD;
Noiselessly, then they crept on tip-&#xD;
toe up a narrow. stone staircase, and&#xD;
entered a room above, in which a large&#xD;
lamp with a shade of crimson glass cast&#xD;
a subdued light around upon costly&#xD;
decorations and luxurious furniture.&#xD;
The thick velvet pile of the carpet&#xD;
rendered  their footsteps inaudible;&#xD;
and while the hunchback buried him&#xD;
self in loosening the insensible man's&#xD;
cravat, his beautiful companion glided&#xD;
to and fro as noiseless as a phantom.a&#xD;

But the horror of his situation had&#xD;

He felt the floor was giving way be-&#xD;

He clutched wildly at the walls.&#xD;
Their shy surface slipped from his&#xD;
fingers.&#xD;
A hideous vapor arose from under-&#xD;

Great heavens! what fearful death&#xD;

Rapidly the floor sank beneath his&#xD;
feet, and the slimy walls glided from&#xD;

Then there was a grating sound be-&#xD;

No the thought was too fearful.    t&#xD;
He felt that his mind was giving way&#xD;
under the accumuhition of terrors.&#xD;
- Then lie made the roof ring again with&#xD;
his piercing lirieks.&#xD;
And then, exhausted and panting for1&#xD;
breath, he began to grope his way.&#xD;
along by the wall.&#xD;
Perhaps there might be a way out of&#xD;
the place into which lie had fallen.&#xD;
tIe might be able to escape.&#xD;
Oh, how his heart bounded at the&#xD;
thought.!&#xD;
lie groped his way onwards very&#xD;
slowly and carefully, for he was fearful&#xD;
of falling into some hole, and sinking'&#xD;
over his head in the filth.&#xD;
As it was, where he was now walk-&#xD;
Ing the water only reached up to his&#xD;
waist, and with intense delight ie dis-&#xD;
covered as he progressed that it grew&#xD;
more shallow.&#xD;
lie walked so very slowly that the&#xD;
wall he was following seemed of enor-&#xD;
mous length, andh e began to think&#xD;
that he.was in some sewer. at the mouth&#xD;
of which he should in good time arrive.&#xD;
Finding no obstacles in his way he&#xD;
grew bolder, and increased his pace.&#xD;
But suddenly his progress was cut&#xD;
short.&#xD;
lie struck his head violenly against&#xD;
a wall im front of him.&#xD;
Very much crestfallen, he turned and&#xD;
began to follow the second wall.&#xD;
All before him was dark and dismal,&#xD;
yet not quite hopeless, for surely there&#xD;
must be an outlet, and it was only a&#xD;
work of time and patience.,&#xD;
But after he had crept along by the&#xD;
wall side for about twenty feet, his pro-&#xD;
gress was again cut short.&#xD;
There wa another wall before him.&#xD;
&#xD;
A deep sigh escaped his heaving.&#xD;
breast when he made the dcrscovery. -&#xD;
A horrible thought broke upon him.&#xD;
He was in a large square hole or cess-&#xD;
pool, or cellar from which there was no&#xD;
outlet.&#xD;
Wearily and despondently he turned&#xD;
the corner, and beg:n slowly creeping&#xD;
along by the third wall.&#xD;
He was now'traveling in the direction&#xD;
from which he had originally-come.&#xD;
Only one of the four sides had yet to&#xD;
be explored  In this lay his last hope.&#xD;
With a fast-beating heart,-then, he&#xD;
crept onwards.&#xD;
He scarcely dared to hope; the re-&#xD;
action would be too horrible : it would,&#xD;
he felt, be ware than he could bear.&#xD;
The cold perspiration broke out upon&#xD;
his face.&#xD;
His hair bristled upon his head.&#xD;
his knees smote together.&#xD;
Onward, onward, the journey seemed&#xD;
to be interminable.&#xD;
Would he never reach the end?&#xD;
As he proceeded, however, he made&#xD;
a terrible discovery. As he advanced,&#xD;
the water rose.&#xD;
It continued to grow deeper and&#xD;
deeper, and had soon reached hiebreast&#xD;
and was rising towards his chin.&#xD;
If he was obliged to travel much&#xD;
further, he must. either travel under&#xD;
water or swim.&#xD;
But when he was reflecting upon&#xD;
these dismal alternatives, and when&#xD;
the filthy water had ieachle  his chin,&#xD;
he found himself, to his great delight,&#xD;
at the fourth wall.       .&#xD;
Ie groped his way along now with&#xD;
a throbbing heart, for his only hope lay&#xD;
tie ;e.&#xD;
A few moments more and all would&#xD;
be decided.&#xD;
Eagerly his hands followed the wall,&#xD;
but his heart grew heavier every step&#xD;
l'e took..                    .&#xD;

The deer of the hovel, though very&#xD;

There was no sign of human presence&#xD;

that it was broad day without, Ralph&#xD;
had little fear of any act Qf violence.&#xD;

WnosE was that piercing    shriek&#xD;
which had rung in Ralph's ears as he&#xD;
fell through the trap I&#xD;
What had become of the beautiful&#xD;
girl to whom he had been so myste-&#xD;
riously wedded, and from whom he had&#xD;
been so suddenly separated.&#xD;
These are questions to whi*h our&#xD;
story obliges us to find an immediate&#xD;
answer, although to do so we are re-&#xD;
luctantly compelled to desert our hero&#xD;
f    in a highly critical situation.&#xD;
In a quaintly-fashioned chamber in&#xD;
the  eastern wing of the old ball the&#xD;
fair creature who had played the part&#xD;
of the bride in the strange ceremony&#xD;
lay in an unconscious state upon her&#xD;
virgin couch.&#xD;
Cold, powerless, passive, she lay&#xD;
there, supremely beautiful, yet with&#xD;
the pallor of death upon her soft peach-&#xD;
like cheeks.&#xD;
Helpless in the hands of those who-&#xD;

e girl could not, though the .internal&#xD;
struggle was absolutely terrific inits&#xD;
e smothered   violence, shake off the&#xD;
s$ torpor weighing her down, numbing&#xD;
her senses, crippling her vital energies.&#xD;
But as the hours crept slowly on the&#xD;
imprisoned soul struggled more furious-&#xD;
n ly for freedom.&#xD;
Violently ere now had i* 'attled with&#xD;
a its manacles.&#xD;
When the hideous hi mack was, at&#xD;
her mnotIer-m-law's directions, carry-&#xD;
- ing her away to , her bed-chamber, the&#xD;
e young bride had given vent to the&#xD;
piercing shriek which had reached the&#xD;
t ears of Ralph when falling through the&#xD;
trap.&#xD;
Instantly, however, were the cries&#xD;
stilled, and she was borne away.°&#xD;
But not before some of the inmates of&#xD;
the house had been alarmed, and in low&#xD;
whispers the mysterious lady and the&#xD;
huachback coisulted together upon the&#xD;
future course of action.&#xD;
"The effects of the potion seem to be&#xD;
wearing off," the lady said.&#xD;
If  is the long delay."&#xD;
"There are only two courses open to&#xD;
us; we must get away at once or-"&#xD;
"Or renew the draught."&#xD;
"No, no; that must not be done, I&#xD;
fear it might cost her her life."&#xD;
"It would certainly be a dangerous&#xD;
expe inent."&#xD;
"Too dangerous. I-I would not have&#xD;
my hands stained with her blood, much&#xD;
as I should gain by her death."&#xD;
"The carriage we agreed should .be&#xD;
here at six."&#xD;
"That is very late."&#xD;
"They will keep their time, though,&#xD;
mny lady ; I api certain that. we can&#xD;
depend upon them."&#xD;
"Let us hope so. If she recoycrs her&#xD;
senses before then, wo arc lost."&#xD;
They carried the poor girl Ainto her&#xD;
bedchamber and laid her upon the&#xD;
couch where her motionless limbs were&#xD;
extended, her face turned upward&#xD;

Greedily her ears drank in the awful&#xD;

What availed her innocence? for she&#xD;
was as innocent as she was ignorant of&#xD;
the evil imputed to her.&#xD;
The villagers were bent on her de-&#xD;
struction.  -&#xD;
A horrible doom awaited her, from&#xD;
which there appeared to be no earthly&#xD;
hope of escape.-&#xD;
A fatal resemblance she certainly&#xD;
bore to a certain woman whom her&#xD;
would-be murderers supposed her to be.&#xD;
The same likeness, it will be remem-&#xD;
bered, Red Ralph had noticed with&#xD;
amazement and alarm.&#xD;
To what awful end would it lead?&#xD;
f'e shall see.                 '&#xD;
The raging, howling mob crowded&#xD;
round and jibed at and menaced her.&#xD;
"Fire the pile! fire the pile !" some&#xD;
shrieked, thinking there was an un-&#xD;
necessary delay.&#xD;
The poor girl, pale as death and half&#xD;
fainting with fear, stretched forth her&#xD;
arms iln pitiful entr eaty.&#xD;
' Mercy! mercy !" she shrieked&#xD;
"Hear her," yelled one of the hags;&#xD;
"she asks mercy of us !"&#xD;
And then a yell of devilish laughter&#xD;
followed from the rest.&#xD;
" Sto who has withered our limbs,&#xD;
and blinded our eyes, and blasted the&#xD;
land on which she looked, she asks for&#xD;
pity !"&#xD;
"Burn her i burn her ! the death is far&#xD;

They were deaf to her~prayerse,&#xD;
They thirsted for her blood with a&#xD;
devouring thirst, which her blood alone&#xD;
could appease.&#xD;
"Mercy! mercy!"&#xD;
Her voice was drowned by the yells&#xD;
of the mob.&#xD;
A flaming torch, passed from hand to&#xD;
hand, now set light to the faggots and&#xD;
straw which surround' g.her.&#xD;
The straw blazed fiercely up, but the&#xD;
wood was green, and as yc only hissed&#xD;
and spluttered.&#xD;
A shout was made for more straw&#xD;
and for dry wood, and' soon plenty of&#xD;
both was brought to the scene of torture.&#xD;
A light was applied to the fresh ma-&#xD;
terial and the flame caught it and&#xD;
blazed fiercely.&#xD;
A dense black smoke arose and hid&#xD;
the victim from those who were eager&#xD;
to gloat their eyes upon her excruciating&#xD;
sufferings.&#xD;
Long and painful they seemed des-&#xD;
tined to be, for the wind was blowing&#xD;
the smoke away from h '-amd the&#xD;
flames were steadily creeping upward.&#xD;
She would not be choked, she would&#xD;
be roasted alive.&#xD;
Like fiends from hell the rabble&#xD;
danced and   screamed  around   her,&#xD;
stirred up the tire, and fanned the&#xD;
flames.&#xD;
Their savage   cries drowned  her&#xD;
agoizing shrieks of terror.   .t&#xD;
They also drowned the sound of the&#xD;
tramp of approaching horses.&#xD;
Before any one heard the noise of the&#xD;
horses' hoofs, the horses and their&#xD;
riders were in their midst.&#xD;
Bright naked swords gleamed fitfully&#xD;
in the firelight.&#xD;

Ralph listened intently.            Passing through the door he crept&#xD;
"What I'm to have for this job is along the passage after the two men.&#xD;

thinking of her now I'm a respectable&#xD;
married man with a prospective chanc&#xD;
(a very vague chance, though) o' being&#xD;
the parent of a family."&#xD;
While he was thus reflecting he&#xD;
fancied he heard the sound of footsteps&#xD;
overhead.&#xD;
"It is the police officers," said he to&#xD;
himself; " they  : coming in to be&#xD;
stowed away. Won't there be an awful&#xD;
scrimmage presently !"&#xD;
The door opened at this moment.&#xD;
Ralph screwed himself as close as he&#xD;
could to the wall.&#xD;
The persons ho expected, however,&#xD;
did not enter the cave, but in their&#xD;
place a number of men, booted and&#xD;
spurred, and travel-stained.&#xD;
These were the robbers, he could see&#xD;
't a glance, and they had returned from&#xD;
their expedition, whatever that might&#xD;
have been.&#xD;
Directly they entered the cave one of&#xD;
them lit a fire, and almost immediately&#xD;
cooking operations commenced.&#xD;
The food they were preparing was&#xD;
very coon ready, and they took their&#xD;
aces round a large wooden table,&#xD;
which already was ornamented by a&#xD;
number of bottles and glasses.&#xD;
Louty they - laughed, deeply they&#xD;
swore and drank, and ravenously they&#xD;
devoured their food.&#xD;
They were a fierce rough lot, and&#xD;
Ralphoennl! inot help thinumg that the&#xD;
constables would find their capture&#xD;
rather a tough job.&#xD;
It the middle ofthe eal the man&#xD;
entered wh se treacherous plot Ralph&#xD;
had overheard.&#xD;
"The captain! the captain!" re-&#xD;
sounded an all sides, and the men rose'&#xD;
to their feet.&#xD;

e   " Not much luck," replied one e the&#xD;
, men in a surly tone; " they must have&#xD;

e   "lowso?"&#xD;
e "It was a wild goose chase, that's&#xD;
alL"&#xD;
" What ! was there no treasure in the&#xD;

' "Nothing worth carrying away."&#xD;
"You've had very bad luck of late, it&#xD;
seems to me."&#xD;
"We've not had very good. It's not&#xD;
my fault for one, anyhow."&#xD;
"Whose fault do yen suppose it is ?"&#xD;
askedthe captain angrily. "Is it mine?"&#xD;
There was a pause.&#xD;
Well, captain," said the man who&#xD;
had before spoken, and  he appeared.&#xD;
to be a sort of lieutenant, "you've not&#xD;
led us lately as you used to do."&#xD;
"Do you want a iresh leader?" the&#xD;
captain asked, in an agitated voice. "Ia&#xD;
there anything you ha'e to complain&#xD;
of? Ain't I true to you 1"&#xD;
There was a dead silence. It was&#xD;
evident that there was something wrong&#xD;
in the camp.&#xD;
"Which is he uno dares say I am not&#xD;
true to you t" asked the captain in a&#xD;
loud voice, and he drew, as he spoki&#xD;
pistol from his belt. - f&#xD;
"I dare," cried an unknown voice,&#xD;
and next monmnt Red Ralph stood in&#xD;
their midst.&#xD;
For an instant there was a deathlike&#xD;
silence-a pamc, i which everybody&#xD;
stood motionless as though turned to&#xD;
stone ; the most astonished of all being&#xD;
the captain himself.&#xD;
Ere he could suffciently recover him-&#xD;
self, however, Ralph had sprung upon&#xD;
him, wrenched the pistol from his hand,&#xD;
felled him to the earth, and placed la&#xD;
foot upon'his neck:&#xD;
Then the Yellow Band rose with&#xD;
angry roar, and the ir bristled with&#xD;
naked swords.'&#xD;

" Cut him down !" was the cry of all&#xD;
But Ralph waved them back im-&#xD;
periously.&#xD;
"Listen to ine first," he said authori-&#xD;
tatively; "kill me if I speak not the&#xD;
truth. This man is a traitor,"&#xD;
A traitor ?"&#xD;
"Yes; at this moment and with his&#xD;
consent there are some constables con-&#xD;
cealed in the lower cave."&#xD;
"Constables in the cave ?"&#xD;
"You can easily overcome them if&#xD;
you act with promptitude. But in the&#xD;
meanwhile secure this man."&#xD;
The captain was very u(1iCkly blountd&#xD;
hand aid foot, and then the robbers,&#xD;
concentrating their strength, made a&#xD;
rush down into the other cellar.&#xD;
Almost immediately afterwards there&#xD;
followed the sound of firearms and the&#xD;
 thing of steel.&#xD;
he battle raged furiously for a few&#xD;
moments.&#xD;
Then there followed several .dull&#xD;
splashes, and then dead silence !&#xD;
The robbers came pouring back, and&#xD;
-      in another moment the traitor was&#xD;
pierced a score of times and lay a corpse&#xD;
upon the ground, his late - followers&#xD;
forming a circle round him.&#xD;
"And who are you t" asked the one&#xD;
who acted as lieutenant of the band, ad-&#xD;
dressing our hero.&#xD;
" My name is Ralph," he answered&#xD;
boldly-" Red Ralph, whom they call&#xD;
Ralph of the Bloody Hand."&#xD;
"Three cheers for Red Ralph !"&#xD;
roared the robbers, to whom his name&#xD;
was as familiar as their own.&#xD;
"And who is to be our chief now ?"&#xD;
one inquired.&#xD;
"Will you try me I" asked our hero.&#xD;
There was a pause of uncertainty,&#xD;
then a loud hurrah rent the air.&#xD;
"Long live our new captain-Red&#xD;
Ralph forever !"&#xD;
Thus summarily was Ralph made&#xD;
captain of the Yellow Band, and that&#xD;
night led them on an expedition by&#xD;
1rhich they secured a heavy plunder.&#xD;

ALIH -&#xD;
On their way to the cene of te ab.&#xD;
;bery they passed through the village&#xD;
where the scene already described wa&#xD;
taking place.&#xD;
It would indeed require a skiilfull en&#xD;
to describe the astonishment of Red&#xD;
Ralph when he recognized his myste.&#xD;
rious bride, but to do so would be a&#xD;
much easier task than to describe his&#xD;
blank countenance at an event which now&#xD;
occurred.&#xD;
lie had wrapped the fainting girl in a&#xD;
thick cloak with which one of his menu&#xD;
had supplied him, and laid her in the&#xD;
shade under some trees whilst he went&#xD;
a few yards off to give some orders.&#xD;
When ie returned she was gone.&#xD;
Yes; she had disappeared, though&#xD;
how nobody could tell.&#xD;
In vain he questioned all around.&#xD;
No one could tell him.&#xD;
Was she indeed the witch that they&#xD;
had called her i&#xD;
The cloak lay there, but the fainting&#xD;
girl had vanished.&#xD;
They seared the village and couna.&#xD;
try around in vain.&#xD;
" I must give it up," said Ralph ; "I&#xD;
believe I must have married a XWill-o'-&#xD;
the-wisp."&#xD;
From that tine forward he resolved&#xD;
to think no more about her, anddevoted&#xD;
himself entirely to the interests of the&#xD;
Yellow Band.&#xD;
Their-deeds became fa'nous through.&#xD;
out England, and they mere the terror&#xD;
of all classes.&#xD;
It is with their wild and terrible&#xD;
career that we have to do.&#xD;

of Death will be revealed in a future&#xD;

Not a leaf stirred.&#xD;
Presently there was a slight noise in&#xD;
the thick brushwood, a crackling of&#xD;
twigs, and the bushes were parted by&#xD;
two gloved hands, and a man envel-&#xD;
opedin a longriding cloak stepped forth.&#xD;
He glanced about him in all direc-&#xD;
tions before quitting the shadow of the&#xD;
trees, and then gave a low whistle.&#xD;
This signal wa unanswered.&#xD;
"Not here !" muttered  =ho. mian.&#xD;
"Strange! It is already past the hour&#xD;
-I feared that I was behind the time."&#xD;
The man repeated the signal rather&#xD;
louder than before, hut there was no&#xD;
response.&#xD;
"Something is wrong," he continued,&#xD;
' or he would not have failed. Perhaps&#xD;
some of the men have seen him."&#xD;
He drew from beneath his cloak a&#xD;
small hunting-horn, and raising it to his&#xD;
Aouth gave a shiriji loud call, and lis-&#xD;
tened attentively for an answer.&#xD;
The echoes of the call had scarcely&#xD;
diet   ay when the answering note oC&#xD;
a bugle was heard, apparently at no&#xD;
great distance front the spot.&#xD;
lie then repeated his summons, and&#xD;
in a few second  lie was joined by ten&#xD;
or twelve men, who pushed through the&#xD;
;brushwood in every direction.&#xD;
"What is it I" demanded the first&#xD;
comer.&#xD;
"Are you all prepared?"&#xD;
"Yes," returned the men, with one&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" Are we all here 1"&#xD;
" No," returned the man who had&#xD;
st spoken. "Jarvis has gone with&#xD;

"True, lieutenant.--but you know&#xD;
that he didn't speak positively about&#xD;
returning.  In fact, he must .have&#xD;
thought it probable that he wouldn't&#xD;
be back in time, as he said that you were&#xD;
to lead us up if lie didn't arrive."&#xD;
"lie did--but I scarcely like leaving&#xD;
the spot, just yet."&#xD;
"And yet you may do more wrong by&#xD;
remaining, lieutenant."&#xD;
"lie may be in danger."&#xD;
"Do you think so  "&#xD;
" Nothing more likely. You know&#xD;

" True, and, as le counted npon us,&#xD;
he may not have observed his usual&#xD;

"Then we had better lose no-Hah !"&#xD;
There was a shrill shriek of some&#xD;
night bird at a little distance from the&#xD;
spot.&#xD;
" Dart !" cried several of the men.&#xD;
"Is he the scout ?" demanded the&#xD;
lieutrenant.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"What does he mean by that cry,&#xD;

The result proved that the man's&#xD;
surmise was correct, for the next min:-&#xD;
ute the distant tramp of a horse was&#xD;
heard, and undoubtedly coming in that&#xD;
direction.&#xD;
"You're right," said the lieutenant.&#xD;
"Stand clear, all. We must see who&#xD;
approaches."&#xD;
Saying which, he withdrew'into the&#xD;

attack a whole horde.&#xD;

movement as if about to interfere, when&#xD;
a sign from the lieutenant restrained&#xD;
theirhalf-formed purpose.&#xD;
Blow after blow was given and re-&#xD;
turned upon either side with such good&#xD;
earnest that the wood rang again with 1&#xD;
the clashing of their swords.&#xD;
And yet no blood was shed. At&#xD;
length, however, a trifle decided the&#xD;
fght in favor of the stranger,&#xD;
The lieutenant, liavig chanced to&#xD;
step upon the traveler's hat, which&#xD;
had fallen during the con.ift; stutmbled&#xD;

such serious earnest that once more&#xD;
they paused, and once again the lieu-&#xD;

how the conflict would have ended&#xD;
it is impossible to say, had not a un-&#xD;
expected termination been put to it by&#xD;

word. Now, then, for the Palmer's&#xD;
Cell !"-&#xD;
With a low murmur of assent the&#xD;
band set off in accordance with these&#xD;
instructions.&#xD;
Now, although the roadway was by&#xD;
no means as near a route to the trysting-&#xD;
place, the other paths were so obstruct-&#xD;
ed with the great growth of briars&#xD;
and thorns and all kinds of wild vege-&#xD;
tation that the lieutenant was the first&#xD;
upon the spot with his right-haud man&#xD;
Wolff.&#xD;
The Palmer's Cell was one of the&#xD;
antiquarian relics of the locality, and&#xD;
deserves a word  of description.&#xD;
A rude rocky'cavern, which had evi-&#xD;
dently been made habitable in some re-&#xD;
mote age by the hermit who had given&#xD;
the name to the spot, by some rough&#xD;
masonry, brickwork, and certain equal-&#xD;
ly rough efforts at ecclesiastical sculp-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
Upon the right of this cavern was a&#xD;
dark recess, which upon entering from&#xD;
the lig   appeared only to contain a&#xD;
range of natural shelves formed in the&#xD;
rock. A nearer glance, however, when&#xD;
the eye grew more accustomed. to the&#xD;
saldows, proved it to be the entrance to&#xD;
a second cave of a like nature.&#xD;
From this branched a second and a&#xD;
third aartnent of artificial formation,&#xD;
and from one of these inner caverns was&#xD;
a second   communication with   the'&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
Immediately facing the entrance of&#xD;
the Palmer's Cell was a ,wooden gate,&#xD;
upon which was written "Saint Geof-&#xD;
frey's Retreat," which was one of the&#xD;
few Roman Catholic religious establish-&#xD;
mients iA existence at the period of our&#xD;
history in England.&#xD;

The lieutenant and his man entered&#xD;
the cavern.&#xD;
"Not arrived yet, Wolff," said the&#xD;
former.&#xD;
"No; I thought we should be bthe&#xD;
first here-hullo! what's this 7"&#xD;
lie picked up from the ground a&#xD;
piece of white muslin apparently tora&#xD;
from a feminine garment.&#xD;
"XWhy, there's blood upon it. There's&#xD;
been some ugly piece of work carried on&#xD;
here ; see, too, there are very evident&#xD;
traces of a struggle.&#xD;
ft was indeed as the lieutenant had&#xD;
said. Upon examining the earth more&#xD;
closely by the aid of a lantern which&#xD;
Wolff carried they could discern several&#xD;
moist patches, and experience taught&#xD;
them that it was the moisture of human&#xD;
gore.&#xD;
"I hope that no harm has come to&#xD;
the captain," muttered the lieutenant,&#xD;
uneasily.&#xD;
" The captain  " iterated Wolf; "yeu&#xD;
surely don't think it possible."&#xD;
"And wherefore 1"&#xD;
"The victim in this job is doubtless a&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
"Pshaw ! because we find a scrap of&#xD;
a woman's dress bedabbled with blood&#xD;
you conclude that it is a woman who&#xD;
has come to grief., But we shall see."&#xD;
The noise of some one approaching&#xD;
caught his ear.&#xD;
"The men are coming up," said WolL&#xD;
"They make noise enough for a regi-&#xD;
ment of cavalry," muttered the lieu-&#xD;
tenant, angrily; "one would think they&#xD;
wished to be discovered."&#xD;
" Stay," interrupted Wolff; "we are&#xD;
in error ; it is not they who come."&#xD;
"'Ah ! how know-you?"&#xD;
" I hear the tramp f horses," replied&#xD;
Wolff, uneasily.&#xD;
"Some late travelers, I presume.&#xD;
We must not let the present job blind&#xD;
us for any thing else that may turn up&#xD;
in the way of business."&#xD;
' "Stand close, lieutenant," said Wol&#xD;
"whilst I go and reconnoitre."&#xD;

Wolff walked warily to the mouth of&#xD;
the caveru, and, clalhering into the&#xD;

"1 I see that the re are six horsemen&#xD;

the lieutenant.&#xD;
lie grasped Wolff by the wrist and&#xD;
stepped noiseleesly through the entrance&#xD;
to the first inner chamber.&#xD;
Here, however, the sound of the voice&#xD;

Wolff silently followed, and' in a&#xD;
instant they gained the other exit.&#xD;
Wild andhis men were already search'&#xD;
Ong in the adjoining cavern.°&#xD;

They passetd ion through the aperture,&#xD;
pushing aside the bryirs which covered&#xD;
it, and-&#xD;

tlteni.&#xD;
They glanced upwards and found that&#xD;
they were covered by a pair of horse&#xD;
pis-tois held by one of Jonathan Wild's&#xD;
Jaizaries.&#xD;
It wats Marks. When Wild had or-&#xD;
dered him off to the left the two fugi&#xD;

they both feinted to fly in opposite&#xD;
directions, and then suddenly threw&#xD;
themselves forward upon their faces.&#xD;
Tihre were two reports, followed by&#xD;
a cry of pain.&#xD;
" Ah !" cried the lieutenant, " I am&#xD;
struck."&#xD;
"Say you so, lieutenant ?" ejaculated&#xD;
Wolff with-un oath; "then, by heaven,&#xD;
it's short work with our friend here.''&#xD;
Marks utter a shout of alarm, and the&#xD;
next instant Wolff was upon him.&#xD;
The former was a big powerfid man,;&#xD;
and for thlre reason always chosen by&#xD;
hi chief, Jonathan Wild, for any post&#xD;
of danger-anenviable mark of distinc-&#xD;
ion for the fellow !  .&#xD;
Wolff was considerably his inferior&#xD;
in she and strength, no doubt, .mt the&#xD;
suddenness of the attack comijletely&#xD;
took the other by surprise.&#xD;
In far less time titan the-incident has&#xD;
taken to record Marks lay stretched&#xD;
upon the turf, pigned to the ground by&#xD;
the robber's knee.&#xD;
"Lieutenant! " cried Wolff.&#xD;
But there was no reply. Tlicavern&#xD;
only returned the-call with a dismal&#xD;
echo which filled him with thoughts of&#xD;
blood and revenge. l&#xD;
"bDead !"  he  exclaimed, horror-&#xD;
stricken. "Lieutenant, answer me."&#xD;
No reply.&#xD;
"You've shed the best blood of us,'&#xD;
cried Wolff, "and now prepare for the&#xD;
worst."-&#xD;
He drew a short knife shaped some-&#xD;
thing like the modern American bowie&#xD;
from his belt, and flourished it before&#xD;
i  eyes of the hapless Marks..&#xD;
"Mercy! mercy " cied the oicer.&#xD;
&#xD;
But Wolff's only reply to tliis was to&#xD;
make a third call to his lieutenant,&#xD;
which but met with the former results.&#xD;
"Now, heaven have mercy upon your&#xD;
soni."&#xD;
"Onee minute," supplicated the ter-&#xD;
ror-stricken wretclh.&#xD;
"Quick, then; it's a short shrift&#xD;
you'll get at my hands.  Lieutenant !"&#xD;
" help ! helni ! murder ! mercy ! ha !"&#xD;
Wolff raised his hand to strike the&#xD;
fatal blow.&#xD;
Marks closed his eyes and ceased to&#xD;
struggle. There was a sharp bustling&#xD;
noise close at hand, and the upraised&#xD;
arm of the robber was caught in grasp&#xD;
of iron crc it could descend.&#xD;
Then Wolff was toppled over and fell&#xD;
beside his hito prostrate antagonist to&#xD;
find himself in a like predicament.&#xD;
It was Jonathan Wild himself who,&#xD;
at this critical juncture for his function-&#xD;
ary tihus reversed the chances.&#xD;
"Silas Vollf," exclaimed Wild, joy.&#xD;
frlly ; "so, so, my old friend, we meet&#xD;
again !"&#xD;
Trie robber struggled frantically to&#xD;
free  himself from  the thief-takers&#xD;
clutches, but in vain. A man of Wild's&#xD;
well-known prodigious strength was not&#xD;
to be shahen off.&#xD;
"Struggle away, Silas," said the thief.&#xD;
taker ; " I could cry quits with you now&#xD;
if l chose, but I've sworn to have the&#xD;
pleasure of hanging you, and you know&#xD;
me for a man of my word."&#xD;
"Liar!" gasped Wolff.&#xD;
" Fool," retorted Wild, ferociously,&#xD;
to-night you accoinpany your friend&#xD;
the !ieutenant and Red Ralph to.New-&#xD;
,gate."&#xD;
"Never !"&#xD;
lie renewed his efforts tG escape, but&#xD;
Wild pressed upon him so cruelly, that&#xD;
he waus nearly suffo-ated-&#xD;
"What; Iho !" shouted Wild ; " bring _&#xD;
some cords. Here, you Marks, jump&#xD;
up-idiot! the danger's over now."&#xD;
But Marks did not stir    He 1ted&#xD;
swooned from fear.&#xD;

A second cry from the thief-taker had procted a bucket of water from&#xD;

aeeurely bound.                    in restoring the swooning Marks to con-&#xD;

Wild.                                As he opened his eyes he glance&amp;amp;&#xD;
This command was readily obeyed, about him, affrightedly, but was reas-&#xD;
and Wolff had the satisfaction of seeing sured after Wild had abused him round-&#xD;
that the lieutenant still breathed, al- ly for his cowardice.&#xD;
though in a similar sad plight.      "I had a narrow squeak, M-. Wild,"&#xD;
Thus his silence was explained:  mumbled the crestfallen Marks.&#xD;
Wild and his men had fallen so sud-  "You'll be nearer the end one of these&#xD;
denly upon the lieutenant and his men days," said Wild.&#xD;
that he was bound and gagged before  "I say-stop---I think I can&#xD;
he could warn his companions.      something."&#xD;
"So far," said Wild to Tom King,   his hearing was sharpenedby having&#xD;
"all has proceeded satisfactorily."  his head close to the ground.&#xD;
"No   casualties ?"  demanded  the  "What do you hear ?"&#xD;
other.                               "I fancy I can hear foetteps in the&#xD;

The lieutenant could only reply with&#xD;
a glance.&#xD;
"Put your head nearer mire," said&#xD;
Wolff.&#xD;
The other obeyed as well as he was1&#xD;
able, and the faces of the two robbers&#xD;
touched.&#xD;
However, instead of embracing as the&#xD;
*idinary spectator might have supposed&#xD;
they were about to do, Wolff merely&#xD;
seized between his teeth the gag which&#xD;
choked the lieutenant's utterance and&#xD;
tugged at it violently.&#xD;
It was a hard pull, and tested severe-&#xD;

organs.&#xD;
But perseverence gained the day, and&#xD;
the gag was shifted.&#xD;

. Before the main could reply a female&#xD;

ALTIIOTGHo a deep mystery enveloped i&#xD;
khe disappearance of Ralph's bride, and&#xD;
ie efforts to find her whihh his trusty I&#xD;
band of Yellow Boys had made in his&#xD;
behalf were entirely fruitless, yet a few 1&#xD;
words will suffice to let-the reader know&#xD;
what had become of her.f&#xD;
Scarcely had Ralph left her si'le when l&#xD;
dark figure crawled towards her&#xD;
rough the brushwood.&#xD;
It wriggled itself onward with a&#xD;
make-like motion.&#xD;
It writhed and twisted like a crushed&#xD;
worm.&#xD;
The beautiful girl had not yet recov-&#xD;
ered her senses, or the sight of the&#xD;
monstrous object would have scared her&#xD;
outof her wits.&#xD;
It was scarcely possible to believe the&#xD;
livid face, blood-shot eyes, and black&#xD;
id crooked fangs to belong to a human&#xD;
being.&#xD;
It was, however, the head of the&#xD;
hanchback which appeared   between&#xD;
the bushes as Ralph retreated, and the&#xD;
unehback's misshapen carcase was it&#xD;
1so which wriggled and writhed its&#xD;
ortuous course towards the insensible.&#xD;

Noiselessly but rapidly he approached-&#xD;

As he spoke a red glare burst out in&#xD;
the sky over the v.llage.&#xD;
The hunchback shook his clenched&#xD;
fist in the air and laughed loud and,&#xD;
long.&#xD;
The glare grew more intense. .&#xD;
The sky was blood.-red.&#xD;
Shrieks of terror mingled with savag&#xD;

"I'll lock all the doors and take the&#xD;

to help herself until I return, if she re-&#xD;
gains her consciousness ; and-as for the&#xD;
old woman, it will be all she can do to&#xD;
save herself front croaking."&#xD;
He stole on tiptoe up-stairs, unlocked&#xD;
the bedroom door, and peeped in at the&#xD;
unconscious girl.&#xD;
She lay there motionless, pale, and&#xD;
death-like.&#xD;
A horrible smile crossed the mis-&#xD;
shapen wretch's face.&#xD;
He chuckled softly to himself, and&#xD;
stole away again like a thief, having&#xD;
once more carefully locked the door.&#xD;
She's in my power, now," he munt-&#xD;
tered: "she is mine, and nought can&#xD;
save her."&#xD;
*      *     *      *     S&#xD;
The beautiful girl lay for a long&#xD;
while in an insensible state; at last,&#xD;
towards the evd . of the night, she&#xD;
slowly and painfully returned to con-&#xD;
sciousness.&#xD;
She opened her eyes and gazed around&#xD;
her in terror.&#xD;
She started up in bed, stretched forth&#xD;
her arms, and cried out wildly-&#xD;
"Mercy1 mercy !"&#xD;
she thought that she was yet at the&#xD;
stake in the hands of the bloodthirsty&#xD;
fanatics from whom Ralph had delivered&#xD;
her.&#xD;
She clutched the bedclothes in her&#xD;
small white hands, and uttered a half-&#xD;
euppressed shriek of terror.&#xD;
But soon the truth began to dawn&#xD;
upon tier.&#xD;
The Pale moonlight pouring into the&#xD;
room revealed to her certain articles of&#xD;
furniture which she recollected.&#xD;
" It is the same place that I was at&#xD;
before," she murmured; "why have&#xD;
they brought me back here ?"&#xD;
The more she reflected upon the sub-&#xD;
jsct, the miore the horror of her helpless&#xD;
situation erushed and stupiile. her.&#xD;
But she would not lie there to await&#xD;
&#xD;
her doom without making an effort to&#xD;
escape from her-unknown jailers.&#xD;
She very slowly and painfully got off&#xD;
the bed,&#xD;
The floor scorned to spin round with&#xD;
her, for she was faint and giddy.&#xD;
A death-like silence reigned around,&#xD;
and so intense was it that she could&#xD;
hardly believe the house had any other&#xD;
occupant.&#xD;
It was a strange close-smelling room,&#xD;
and the gloomy iose had the appear-&#xD;
arice of a building over which hangs&#xD;
some awful curse.&#xD;
Perhaps it was cursed.&#xD;
It was a house where you heard dim&#xD;
rumbling noises in the dead of the night,&#xD;
and echoing taps against the mouldy&#xD;
wainscotting.&#xD;
Spectral footsteps, too, creaked in&#xD;
darki nailed-up rooms, and the nibbling&#xD;
and seanpering of rats in cellars and&#xD;
choked up drains, and the beating o&#xD;
death - watches in damp  crumbling&amp;amp;&#xD;
walls.&#xD;
As she listened, some such noises as&#xD;
these filled the beauteous Leonore's&#xD;
heart with dread and apprehension.&#xD;
She was, however, almost entirely&#xD;
without -apparel, and it would be&#xD;
necessary to find some garments.&#xD;
With this idea she began to search&#xD;
the room, and approaching the door of&#xD;
what seemed a cupboard, with some&#xD;
difliculty contrived to open it.&#xD;
The door suddenly swung open with&#xD;
an ominous creak, and at the same mo.&#xD;
ment' Leonore started away with a faint&#xD;
scream, putting up her hands as' she&#xD;
did so to ward off some approaching&#xD;
horror.&#xD;
A white and grizzly death's head&#xD;
was suddenly protruded from the door-&#xD;
way.&#xD;
Two long fleshless aris were stretched&#xD;
out and encircled her waist.&#xD;
She sin ieked and struggled, but&#xD;
struggled in vai n.&#xD;

RED RALPH AND THE DRUNKEN FOP--&#xD;
STANLEY POWELL GROWS TOO LOVING&#xD;
--A YOUNG LADY WRO COULD FENCE-j&#xD;
'T11FIGH1T TIrE INTERRUPTION.&#xD;
HAVING seen the Lady Maude safely&#xD;
housed with her old friend Mr. Mount-&#xD;
joy in M1addox Fields, Ried Ralph was&#xD;
retracing his steps in the direction of&#xD;
Piccadilly, in which quarter he was in&#xD;
the habit of putting up with a friend&#xD;
whenin town, when hemet with a tittle&#xD;
adventure, which as it is in some way&#xD;
way connected with a previous chapter&#xD;
of this narrative, we shall here relate.&#xD;
He was passing a house which was&#xD;
brilliantly iluminated, and from'which&#xD;
the sound of boisterous revelry was&#xD;
issuing, when an unsteady gallant, de-&#xD;
scending the stone steps, got his sword&#xD;
between his legs, and came down head&#xD;
first, almost capsizing Red Ralph.&#xD;
"Halo !" cried Ralph, who was still&#xD;
in disguise.&#xD;
"A thou-thousand' pardons, a mere&#xD;
slip of the tongue ; no, d- it, don't&#xD;
mean that; but you understand, madam,&#xD;
no offence."&#xD;
"Not in the least," said Ralph.&#xD;
" Thats right, then, let's be friends-&#xD;
gish a kish."&#xD;
Red Ralph pushed the maudlin wine-&#xD;
bibber from him in disgust.&#xD;
" Don't be coy, my gipsy."&#xD;
"Can you tell me whose house is that,&#xD;
pray, sir 1" asked Ralph.&#xD;
"That [ can."&#xD;
"Thank you, sir."&#xD;
"And aba IJ"&#xD;

&#xD;
She battled frantically, but the mons-&#xD;
ter held 'her still in its iron grasp.&#xD;
She was in ,the arms of a' hideous&#xD;
skeleton ; its fleshless jaws pressed&#xD;
against her pale cheek, while its eyeless&#xD;
sockets and something that appeared&#xD;
to be a head of straggling white hair,&#xD;
looking indescribably horrible in the&#xD;
ghastly moonlight.&#xD;
CHAPTER     XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
"If you please."&#xD;
"And what if I don't please ?"&#xD;
And here the drunkard smiled super-&#xD;
ciliousy with the look of tipsy import.&#xD;
ance which men at a certain stage of&#xD;
alchbholic aberration frequently wear.&#xD;
"I don't mind telling you, though,"&#xD;
he resumed, " that, hicd! that house be-&#xD;
longs to the hardest drinker in the&#xD;
country ; I'll match him against any&#xD;
man at his own liquors."&#xD;
" Who ?"&#xD;
"Stanley Powell."&#xD;
" IIa'h !'&#xD;
" Goograslhus, you frighten me."&#xD;
"Is Mr. Stanley Powell in the house&#xD;
at present ?"&#xD;
"Coursh," answered the reveller with&#xD;
a disdainful curl of the lip at Ralph's&#xD;
ignorance. "Hallo there ! by Bacchus i&#xD;
she's going into the house.  'ii! you&#xD;
madam, Powell won't see airy woman&#xD;
to-night, there's a bachelor party on."&#xD;
But Ralph, heedless of the drunkard's&#xD;
words, had knocked at. the door and.&#xD;
gained admittance.&#xD;
"Excuse me, madam," said the ser.&#xD;
vant, "but Mr. Powell is-"&#xD;
"Enough," said Ralph, "I must see&#xD;
Mr. Powell to-niglh"&#xD;
A guinea dropped into the man's&#xD;
willing palm, and ttiis little difficulty&#xD;
was smoothed over.&#xD;
"Now go to Mr. Powell and say that&#xD;
a lady would speak with him for a&#xD;
instant."&#xD;
"I dare not; I-"&#xD;
''Go."&#xD;
And a second guinea sent the servant&#xD;
bounding up the stairs to the apartment&#xD;
whence'the sounds of revelry proceeded,&#xD;
The next instant proved, however,&#xD;
that the fears of the domestic had not&#xD;
been without some foundation, for a&#xD;
door above was thrown open with great&#xD;
violence, and a man's voice was hear4&#xD;
showering abusiveejithets upon the&#xD;
servant's head.&#xD;
At the same time a scuffling sound&#xD;
was heard, and a dull thud anwunc 4&#xD;

that the hapless servant's head was&#xD;
-not alone sufering for - its owner's&#xD;
temerity."&#xD;
"Knave ! varlet!" cried the irate Mr.&#xD;
Stanley Powell, pursuing the footman&#xD;
down stairs and administering pedal ap-&#xD;
plications to his nether extremities at&#xD;
each word.&#xD;
"You lying filching jackanapes ! how&#xD;
dare you interrupt me against my ex-&#xD;
press order? D'ye think I keep you in&#xD;
idleness and vagabondism for the pleas-&#xD;
ure of gartg'upon that hideous face ?&#xD;
Answer me, you scoundrel; not a word,&#xD;
you villain ! Eh? go hang yourself, and&#xD;
rob Jack Ketch of his fee."&#xD;
Mr. Stanley Powell had reached the&#xD;
mot of the stairs by this time, and&#xD;
perceived -Ralph, who stood with his&#xD;
head turned aside as if in great alarm.&#xD;
Now Ralph, as the reader must have&#xD;
surmised, by his frequent adoption of&#xD;
the disguise, looked remarkably well as&#xD;
a woman..&#xD;
His figure was slight but graceful, and&#xD;
possessed all the muscular power of a&#xD;
strong man with the fiminine lropor-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
Ralph, too, from his long experience,&#xD;
was remarkably well versed in all the&#xD;
Little coquetries which are the attrac-&#xD;
tionsin the gentler sex.&#xD;
IHI always wore awick veil, through&#xD;
which shone a pair ot lustrous bliak&#xD;
eyes with killing effect, and the umde&#xD;
and quality of his apparel, impressed&#xD;
one with the idea of a lady of superior&#xD;
rank&#xD;
Your pardon, madam," said Mr.&#xD;
Powell, bowing to the ground.&#xD;
Ralph returned his salute with frigid&#xD;
ourtesy..&#xD;
"A thousand pardons, very dearJ&#xD;
madam, I beg," said Mr Powell obse-&#xD;
quivusly.' I 'sas not aware who it was&#xD;
that desired t see me."&#xD;
"The man is not to . blame, Mr.&#xD;
Powell," said Ral.ply... a low tone, as if&#xD;
not, yet recovered trout the effects of&#xD;
Mr. Powell's harshness to his serva-t.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I told him that I had buness of am&#xD;
important nature. I should have said&#xD;
that Lady-"'&#xD;
Iere Ralph paused abruptly, ant-&#xD;
glanced at the servant as if about to&#xD;
commit an indiscretion.&#xD;
" Fore gad !" muttered Mr. Powell to&#xD;
himself, "here's an intrigue."&#xD;
Then he added aloud to the discom-&#xD;
fited servant-&#xD;
"Is the walnut room prepared as I&#xD;
desired ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Very well; now remember, Thomas,&#xD;
that I shall be particularly engatd,&#xD;
and under no pretext under the sun&#xD;
me be disturbed. D'ye' hear me ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Mark you; obey."&#xD;
But, sir-"&#xD;
"What now?"&#xD;
" If Mistress Flagon should callf"&#xD;
"I am out."&#xD;
" Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Unexpected business has called me&#xD;
suddenly out of town-to-oh ! say to&#xD;
'Thie Retreat.' Mistress Flagon will&#xD;

A.nd so did Captain Ralph. '    s&#xD;

nrb1AT DI?.&#xD;
&#xD;
As yetr his true sex ha not been  dis-&#xD;
eevered, but he doubted no# that a few t&#xD;
niinatos more would di close it.&#xD;
Mr. Stanley Powell had been in his S&#xD;
youth an expert swordsman and a&#xD;
ioted duellist.&#xD;
Iut gge and a life of hard living and&#xD;
debauchery had weakened the wrist of ii&#xD;
steel of former days, and ho had been t&#xD;
at the mercy of thme Captain of the Ye- r.&#xD;
low Band any time during the past five t&#xD;
minutes if Ralph had chosen to exevt&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
But the only object of Red Ralph was T&#xD;
to free himself from the obnoxious flirta- h&#xD;
Lion of the old rose, and not to do him&#xD;
any personal violence.&#xD;
The French valet came running to&#xD;
his master's assistance as we have&#xD;
stated.&#xD;
Now, it would not have answered&#xD;
Red Ralph's purpose to be seized b  i&#xD;
Mr. Stauly Powell's menials, for at&#xD;
such  close quarters his  masculine&#xD;
development would most surely have&#xD;
betrayed itself and he would get into&#xD;
-ot water.&#xD;
There was therefore but one chance;&#xD;
left, and of this Red Ralph was not slow&#xD;
t. avail hiineclf.&#xD;
With him to think was  o act.&#xD;
As the French v* was struggling to&#xD;
remove the dining-table, which impeded&#xD;
his progress, Ralph made a sudden and&#xD;
violent feit.r which drove his aged&#xD;
antagonist 3;e. several paces,&#xD;
It was a fortunate though t. A chair&#xD;
was in the way, and Mr. Stanley Powell&#xD;
stumbled and tell over it, and his sword&#xD;
was sent spinning to the further ex-&#xD;

"Send that man away," said Ralph&#xD;
k an undertone.&#xD;
" Jezebel ! I-"&#xD;

said Ralph. "You have a daughter,&#xD;

' In a nunnery,' pursued Ralph--" a&#xD;
prison-house--wasting her youth, with-&#xD;
ering her young heart in obedience to&#xD;
the mandate of her cruel, heartless&#xD;
parent."&#xD;
"Madam !" said Mr. Stanley Powell,&#xD;
' to commence, I may say that your&#xD;
reflection on my actions is unjust-tilat_&#xD;
your interference in my personal mat-&#xD;
ters is d--d impertinent; and I may&#xD;
farther add, madam, that my daughter's&#xD;
mode of life is her owr zvee and un-&#xD;
biassed selection."&#xD;
" You lie !"&#xD;
Mr. Stanley Powell grew scarlet. He&#xD;
hastily clapped..Lhis hand to his side, but&#xD;
his sword was not there.&#xD;
"Pooh!" said Ralph, coolly, "you see&#xD;
how little your anger affects me. You&#xD;
see that even with your own manly&#xD;
weapon I am more than your match; so&#xD;
smother your anger, I implore you. I&#xD;
repeat, sir, you he. Your daughter,-the1&#xD;
unhappy Mary Fowell, has been , lured&#xD;
intothat den under false pretences." I&#xD;
Mr. Powell had passed into anoler&#xD;
stage of indignation, and was now1&#xD;
quietly boiling with suppressed rage.&#xD;
"Listen, madam," said Mr. Stanley,&#xD;
Powell, "I know not who you may be,c&#xD;
nor by what right you force your pres-l&#xD;
ence upon me here for this purpose.&#xD;
But for the nonce I will waive the ques-a&#xD;
tlon of your right to take up the cud-&#xD;
gels in my daughter's behalf, and simply 1&#xD;
contept myself with assuring you that&#xD;
all hope of removing her from her self- 1&#xD;
elected mode of life is useless; she has&#xD;
taken voluntary and irrevocable vows, F&#xD;
which no earthly power can set aside."&#xD;
" I shall not go," said the Captain of&#xD;
the Yellow Band deliberately, " until 1,&#xD;
have effected my purpose."&#xD;
As he said this he set himself down&#xD;
upon the couch.l&#xD;
Fatal chance !                    I&#xD;
As he reached the soft, springy cush-c&#xD;
ions, he heard a sharp grating sound t&#xD;
like the smothered noise of a watch-&#xD;
P'mxes rattle-.,&#xD;

I.&#xD;
&#xD;
ITER OF NIGHT.              .&#xD;
Before he could ask a question:-er&#xD;
he could even give the occurrence&#xD;
second thought--he felt himself seized&#xD;
and held as if in a vice.&#xD;
lied Ralph was utterly bewildered--&#xD;
lost.&#xD;
lio could see no one about him-no&#xD;
one was present but Mr. Stan) y Powell&#xD;
and himself-of that he was ssured&#xD;
and yet he had been grasped by an in-&#xD;
visible power and held down,&#xD;
He was soon convincedothatno human&#xD;
grasp held him, for, if not able to re-&#xD;
lease himself from a powerful clutch,&#xD;
he vell knew that he was never literally&#xD;
immoveable in such a predicament--a&#xD;
circumstancewhich had too frequently&#xD;
occurred to him to give him any undue&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
Then he could always shift himself to&#xD;
the right or left a little, and that when&#xD;
making a violent exertion the grat&#xD;
upon his . person tightened, and grew&#xD;
firmer in proportion to the strength of&#xD;
his effort.&#xD;
Now it was different. lie was held&#xD;
by witchcraft, he imagined, or by some&#xD;
supernatural agency, for the bondage&#xD;
was not bodily painful, and yet he&#xD;
could not move an i$E1 to the right or&#xD;
left-backwards and forwards.&#xD;
"Ha! ha ! madam," cried Mr. Stanley&#xD;
Powell, in wild joyful triumph, "I have&#xD;
you now; you have placed yourself in&#xD;
the lion's den, and you shall suffer for&#xD;
your temerity. You have -had your&#xD;
turn, and omow comes mine."&#xD;
The aged libertine's face flushed with&#xD;
excitement. -&#xD;
He advanced to the couch upon&#xD;
which lay the Captain of the Yellow&#xD;
Band, bound by an invisible power, and&#xD;
helpless.&#xD;
"The first thing," grinned the tooth-&#xD;
ess old libertine, is to look at those&#xD;
willing black eyes, which have been&#xD;
doing such execution during the last&#xD;
twenty minutes upon the humblest of&#xD;
your adorers."&#xD;

Here he met with a slight rebuff,&#xD;
" Halto !" he ejachlated in the great-&#xD;

Ralph's position was becoming criti-&#xD;
cal, and  he would willingly  have&#xD;
sorifloed the whole of that week's&#xD;
large but unlawful.gains to be free and&#xD;
outside Mr. Stanley Powell's mansion.&#xD;
Mr. Powell was evidently much puz-&#xD;
tled, and yet his former interview with&#xD;
the Captain of the Yellow Band had&#xD;
been of so striking a nature that it had&#xD;
left a lasti.g impression upon his mind,&#xD;
and ho could not, in spito of himself,&#xD;

attention to the realization of his tri-&#xD;

" Where can it be 7" he muttered.&#xD;
Then he added, addressing Red Ralph,&#xD;
"We have met before, madam."&#xD;
No," said Ralph.&#xD;
"lBut I say we have; your features&#xD;
and some tones of your voice are in-&#xD;

"  I I possible ."&#xD;
"Not so," said   r. Powell; "and&#xD;
now I understand why I am not quite&#xD;

" Upon what point ." demanded Red&#xD;
Ralph, eudeavoring to appear at hip&#xD;

" You are disgisi*t youi' voice," and&#xD;

Ralph bit is lips and was silent.&#xD;
"A cutpurse, a rogue, I'll be sworn,'&#xD;
continued Mr. Stanley Powell. "li!&#xD;

"Never mind," resumed Mr. Stanley&#xD;
Powell; "I won't mention names."&#xD;
The servant quitted t he room, and&#xD;
the Captain of the Yeltbw Band was left&#xD;
a prey to the mingled sensation of rage,&#xD;
disgust at his iuprudence, and fear fog&#xD;

THE STRUGGLE WITI TIE MANIAG&#xD;
WIFE.&#xD;
IN vain did the beautiful Leonore&#xD;
stru le in the aries of the horrible&#xD;
skeleton.&#xD;
The greater her efforts to release heF-&#xD;
self from  its hateful embrace, the&#xD;
tighter did its clutch seem to become.&#xD;
For a few moments she was wellnigh&#xD;
out of her wits with fright.&#xD;
The attack had been so sudden and&#xD;
'unexpected. 11cr assailant of such an&#xD;
extraordinary nature.&#xD;
1 Many women, under like circum-&#xD;
stances, would have fainted from terror,&#xD;
or continued to scream and struggle&#xD;
unavadlingly.&#xD;
T'is brave girl, however, was not se&#xD;
silly ; she summoned all her courage&#xD;
and reason to hmer aid, and looked the&#xD;
difficulty i'i the face.&#xD;
The skeleton was not alre, although&#xD;
it jumped so niimly out of its hiding-&#xD;
plaice, and clutched her so tightly. It&#xD;
was, after all, but a sort of horrible jack-&#xD;
in-the-box-a mechanical contrivance&#xD;
of fiendish ingenuity.&#xD;
Iow to free herself from its clutches&#xD;
&#xD;
m   * ei .attei . rhich required her&#xD;
Sonsiaeration. When she stood still it&#xD;
was still also  When she pulled away&#xD;
it tightened its hold on her.&#xD;
Thea she recollected that it had&#xD;
spring at at her with open arms. She&#xD;
palled the door towards her, and worked&#xD;
herself round towards the cupboard.&#xD;
Aa she dtc so the skeleton released&#xD;
hold.&#xD;
Suddenly to let go altogether, and,&#xD;
in a way at oee grotequely ludicrous,&#xD;
and horrible, se tipered back into the&#xD;
cupboard.&#xD;
Then she slappd the door to in a&#xD;
moment, and le xed against it, and&#xD;
drew a long breath of relief.&#xD;
Decidedly thgat way a cupboard to be&#xD;
avoided. There was another cupboard&#xD;
also of which she :haa no very favor-&#xD;
able opinion, although ano had not tried&#xD;
it.&#xD;
After a little reflection upon the dif-&#xD;
-cuilties of the situation, she concluded&#xD;
very naturally that only two ways of&#xD;
escape was open to her-the door or the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
As regarded her clothes, there was no&#xD;
time to think about them now. She de-'&#xD;
termined to wrap herself up as well as&#xD;
sae could in a blanket, and throw'&#xD;
herself upon the mercy of some passer by.&#xD;
She munt not go near the village, or&#xD;
who could say what horrible tortures&#xD;
would be inflicted upon her?&#xD;
She first of all turned her attention to&#xD;
the window, but here her hopes were&#xD;
soon blighted when she came to examine&#xD;
the fastenings.&#xD;
It was not only, as the moonlight&#xD;
enabled her to see, very high- from the&#xD;
ground, but it was securely guarded by&#xD;
iron bars of enormous strength.&#xD;
The door, then, was her only hope,&#xD;
but this was locked upon the outside.&#xD;
The wood, however,. was . old and&#xD;
rotten, and the doorpost had, to a small&#xD;
extent, given way, so that there was a&#xD;
possibility of forcing back the bolt from&#xD;
the Inside,&#xD;
&#xD;

.t     i              ,.&#xD;
&#xD;
- What implement was she to uxse,&#xD;
through which to efect this purpose?&#xD;
She looked about the room and, to&#xD;
her great delight, discovered a knife&#xD;
lying behind some litter on the mantel-&#xD;
piece.&#xD;
With this in her hand she approached&#xD;
the door, and was about to operate&#xD;
upon the locki when a creaking noise on&#xD;
the stairs arrested her hand, asid sent&#xD;
her scared and trembling back to the&#xD;
bedside.&#xD;
She retained for some time silent as&#xD;
death and listening intently.&#xD;
But then she came to the conclusion&#xD;
that she must have been mistaken, and,&#xD;
with the knife in her hand, once more&#xD;
approached the door.&#xD;
All was still now.&#xD;
She forced the blade of the knife&#xD;
under the lock, and, without any great&#xD;
exertion of strength, forced it back.&#xD;
'Then she opened the door very&#xD;
cautiously, and peeped out.&#xD;
, All was very quiet and dark. If the&#xD;
house contained any other inmate but&#xD;
herself, ho ar she, as the case might be.&#xD;
must be asleep.&#xD;
As yet, as the reader will remember,&#xD;
Leonore had not set eyes upon either&#xD;
of her jailers.&#xD;
She had recovered from her fainting&#xD;
fit, opened the door, gone down stairs,&#xD;
escaped from the house, and wandered&#xD;
towards the village, only to faint upon:&#xD;
another doorstep, and, on recovering&#xD;
her consciousness, find herself in the&#xD;
hands of the bloodthirsty fanatics from&#xD;
whom Ralph had set her free.&#xD;
Having fainted again, she returned to&#xD;
her senses once more to find herself in&#xD;
the same gloomy unknown house front&#xD;
which she had ruu away.&#xD;
It almost seemed like maie that she&#xD;
should thus travel to and fro, knowing&#xD;
not whither she went or wherefore she&#xD;
was a captive.&#xD;
But it would not do to sit down and&#xD;
wait patiently for the issue. Slis must&#xD;
at once take a decisive step.&#xD;

OR, THE DAUGHTER OF NIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
She descended the stairs very slowly,&#xD;
and cautiously pausing more than once&#xD;
to listen.&#xD;
But she heard nothing, and she soon&#xD;
nme to the conclusion that she was&#xD;
alone in the house.&#xD;
Reaching the bottom of the stairs, she&#xD;
groped along in the -darkoess until her&#xD;
haud encountered the handle of a door.&#xD;
She turned it, but found that the door&#xD;
was locked.                   -&#xD;
Groping her way along she came&#xD;
preently to another door, which she&#xD;
tried with the same result.&#xD;
At last, having tried two iore, she&#xD;
found she could force the knife-blade&#xD;
under the lock of the last, and thus&#xD;
manage to open it.&#xD;
The first faint streak of. dawn was&#xD;
struggling through the iron. bars of the&#xD;
window, but the room was yet almost&#xD;
entirely plunged in obscurity.&#xD;
As Leonore advanced, however, she&#xD;
was able to make out indistinctly the&#xD;
objects which the room contained.&#xD;
One thing at once attracted her at-&#xD;
tention-a long dark something upon&#xD;
the floor.&#xD;
Straining her eyes to the utmost, she&#xD;
approached, and was within a yard of it&#xD;
before she perceived what it was&#xD;
Then she started back, and her blood&#xD;
curdled with horror.&#xD;
it appeared to be the corpse of an old&#xD;
woman, the skull smashed in and the&#xD;
dace covered with blood.&#xD;
The gidl shrank back in terror from&#xD;
the fearful sight.&#xD;
Into what den of horror had she been&#xD;
brought? What would be her own fate&#xD;
tf she remained any longer?&#xD;
She crept out of the room again,&#xD;
shuddering as she went, and closed the&#xD;
door after her.&#xD;
Then she stood, uncertain what to do&#xD;
next-whither to bend her steps.&#xD;
She found her way to the outer-door&#xD;
by wllitoi she had before escaped, but&#xD;
this time it was. double-locked, ant&#xD;
fastened in auch a way that to open ii&#xD;
&#xD;
was. impossible. To open any of th&#xD;
other doors of :this ending was also&#xD;
beyond her power. and she now turned&#xD;
her attention to the floor beneath.&#xD;
She found a staircase which led down&#xD;
below, and, feeling certain that she&#xD;
was alone in the house, fearlessly de-&#xD;
scended.&#xD;
At tae boton of a flight of steep&#xD;
stone steps she caine to a heavy door,&#xD;
very strongly bolted and-barred. W ith&#xD;
some trouble she undid these fastenigs&#xD;
and entered a sort of vaulted chamber,&#xD;
beyond which was pi ch dark.&#xD;
She knew not what to do now. She&#xD;
was afraid to return to the room where&#xD;
the old woman lay, though she fancied&#xD;
that she hal noticed a small piece of&#xD;
candle and some lucifer matches lying&#xD;
on the table.&#xD;
After a momentary hesitation she&#xD;
groped her way onwards in the dark.&#xD;
Opposite to the door which she had&#xD;
entered she found anolier door also&#xD;
securely bolted. This she opened, and&#xD;
entered a place which appeared to be&#xD;
wither.a cell or cellar, lighted by a small&#xD;
grating high up against the ceiling.&#xD;
There was a dreadful stench in this&#xD;
place, and it was very cold and damp&#xD;
Leonore glanced round despairingly,&#xD;
and saw that it contained nothing but&#xD;
an old broken earthenware pitcher, and&#xD;
what at the first sight appeared to be a&#xD;
heap of rags and straw in one corner.&#xD;
As she was turning round again&#xD;
towards the door the clanking of a&#xD;
chain startled her.&#xD;
She startled violently, for at first she&#xD;
thought that the cellar might contain&#xD;
dome savage dog, which would rush&#xD;
out upon her.&#xD;
But there was no further movement,&#xD;
and she was fast coming to the cnclu-&#xD;
sion that the noise must have been&#xD;
made by rats, when a deep and Lillow&#xD;
gioan struck upon her ear.&#xD;
t She stood motionless, her eyes fixed&#xD;
upon the spot from which the sou Ahad&#xD;
t proceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
.-I&#xD;
&#xD;
After a menates' interval the groan&#xD;
was repeated.&#xD;
Well-nigh frightened out of her life,&#xD;
me young girl's first ilea was to fly.&#xD;
but then a thought flashed through her&#xD;
train, and is rapicLly altered her deter-&#xD;
mination.&#xD;
Suppose there was another captive in&#xD;
the house! -&#xD;
Singe both were weaklmt together&#xD;
they right successfully struggle against&#xD;
their  ilors.&#xD;
C'vquering her fear, then, she dr'w&#xD;
near the dark corner.&#xD;
h3 she did so a sight met her eyes&#xD;
wuich -filled her with amazement and&#xD;
1rbrror.&#xD;
Aj1 at once a horrible object became&#xD;
! iscernible in the obscurity, and she&#xD;
tood transfixed before it.&#xD;
The object which terrified her was&#xD;
the figure of a woman, misera-bly dirty&#xD;
and neglected, sitting crouched up like&#xD;
an ape nursing her toes, and half-hidden&#xD;
by straw.&#xD;
It would be impossible to give the&#xD;
reader any just idea of the fearful con-&#xD;
dicion to which cruelty and (neglect had&#xD;
reduced this unhappy creature.&#xD;
Her lean eniaciated body had for its&#xD;
only covering a few filthy rags.&#xD;
She was, to look at, nothing but a&#xD;
bag of bones. IL- arms and legs were&#xD;
fleshless,&#xD;
Her face was shrunken, and her deep-&#xD;
set eyes and hollow jaws ga-ye her the&#xD;
aPpearance of death.&#xD;
A ragged mass of hair hung over her&#xD;
eyes and down her back.&#xD;
&#xD;
upon the miserable captive, and the&#xD;
first involuntary feeling of loathing and&#xD;
disgust gave place in the young girl's&#xD;
gentle heart to one of deep commisera-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
The object of misery looked up at&#xD;
her from among the straw, half covering&#xD;
its face with its hands in doing so, as&#xD;
though afraid.&#xD;
"My poor woman," said Leonora            -&#xD;
in a gentle tene, "what are you doing&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
The captive made no answer, but&#xD;
stared at her in stupid terror.&#xD;
Leonore repeated the question  a;&#xD;
pause.&#xD;
".1 am dying," replied the other in a&#xD;
low faiut voice, scarcely audible.&#xD;
"What is the matters with you?'"&#xD;
'' I am dying of cold and hunger."&#xD;
"how long have you Iteen here ?"&#xD;
"Years.''&#xD;
" Years?"&#xD;
"Ever since I can remember ; I can&#xD;

"Who brought you 1"&#xD;
"Hush, Hush! He will hear you if&#xD;
you speak so loud. He will come back&#xD;

They starve me and beat me, and leave&#xD;
me half mad with thirst for days to-&#xD;

kill me at once with one blow, and put&#xD;
me out of my bitter misery."&#xD;
"But why does your husband keep&#xD;
you thus a prisoner ?"&#xD;
"I know not, except that he was dis-&#xD;
appointed in the fortune hoe thought I&#xD;
should bring him; and because he&#xD;
is as vindictive and unforgiving as a&#xD;
fiend."&#xD;
"I wonder, though, that he does Lot&#xD;
kill you at once, instead of keeping you&#xD;
thus buried alive."&#xD;
"He keeps me alive to watch my&#xD;
sufferings. He often comes down here&#xD;
and gloats his eyes upon my misery.&#xD;
lie dances and laughs and claps his&#xD;
bands with joy when I can appeal. He&#xD;
is a stone. He is dead to all human&#xD;

"You must not remain here to be&#xD;

if I am to make good my escape."&#xD;
"Escape? Have you come here, then,&#xD;
t' help me? God bless you ! God bless&#xD;

"I will try all I can to do so, but I do&#xD;
not know the house, and amunaequain-&#xD;

"Are you, too, a prisoner, beautiful&#xD;

"Yes, I have been brought here in&#xD;
some mysterious way, and for some un-&#xD;
known reason."&#xD;
"For no good purpose, I am certain;&#xD;
lady. For no purpose but your ruin,&#xD;
dishonor, and death. But let us lose no&#xD;
time. Let us fly."&#xD;
" Yes ; let us fly," murmured Leonore&#xD;
thoughtfully. "But how ?"&#xD;
She was moving towards the door,&#xD;
when the other woman suddenly sprang&#xD;
from the corner and caught her by the&#xD;
wrist.&#xD;
"Stay," she cried in an excited tone ;&#xD;
gave me."&#xD;

" No-no, you must not quit my&#xD;

" I must dose for a short time"&#xD;
"No-no-no."&#xD;
"Rest assured I will very shortly re-&#xD;

egress from our prison-house.".&#xD;
"Stay ! stay ! I dare not trust you&#xD;
away from me. You will not come&#xD;
baek. I feel certain you will not come&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"My poor creature, I promise you&#xD;
faithfully that I will not be gone many&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
But it was in vain to reason. The&#xD;
half-witted wretch clung wildly to her,&#xD;
screaming and sobbing.&#xD;
Then, as Leonore struggled to free&#xD;
herself, the other's tears gave place to&#xD;
an ungovernable fury.&#xD;
"I will murder you," she shrieked. "1&#xD;
will have your life if you try to get&#xD;

"Loose your hold !" cried Leonore&#xD;
in terror.&#xD;
But the idiot's hold  seemed to&#xD;
tighten.&#xD;
At that moment, too, a sound in the&#xD;
house above reached their ears.&#xD;
There was a heavy footfall in the&#xD;
passage over head.&#xD;
"Release me, release me !" cried&#xD;
Leonore, struggling madly with her&#xD;

tain Red Ralph and his redOubtable&#xD;
Yellow Band.&#xD;
So securely hail they been bound by&#xD;
&#xD;
"'&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE DAUGHTBlS 0? NIGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
ae men, that escape was deemed an&#xD;
atiter impossibility.&#xD;
The last of the Yellow Band had&#xD;
scecely quitted the gla c, when the&#xD;
branch of a tree, immediate ly above&#xD;
the spot upon which lay the thief-taker&#xD;
hound an i helpless, was shaken vio-&#xD;
lently, and a man appeared scrambliug&#xD;
through the thick foliage.&#xD;
Then he endeavored to clutek the&#xD;
branch wihi the ostensible purpose of&#xD;
ta,ing an easy drop to the ground, but&#xD;
nltortunately missing his hold, he came&#xD;
to the ground with fearful veiecity and&#xD;
a loud thud.&#xD;
We have said "to the grad ;" but&#xD;
heir we are in erro . I e chanced to&#xD;
alight exactly in the softer portioiFof&#xD;
Jonathan Wild's stomach.&#xD;
The latter was, of course, almost an-,&#xD;
elhilated, but the new comer was there-&#xD;
by saved an unpleasant mishap.&#xD;
"Pheugh !" he cried; as he regained&#xD;
his emilibrium and shook himself to-&#xD;
gether. "That was likely to do me&#xD;
sowm hnrm if it hadn't ha' bec for-&#xD;
Why, hallo !" and here he began to&#xD;
look uncemfort Flo, for he recoguised&#xD;
the' thief-taker in the victim  of his&#xD;
misadventure. ' Why it's Mr. Wild !"&#xD;
Jonathan Wild giared upon him in a&#xD;
terrifying manner.&#xD;
"I'm very sorry, Mr. Wild; I am,&#xD;
indeed."&#xD;
Mr. Wild intimated, as well us he&#xD;
could by a glance that he wished to be&#xD;
set free.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Wild," said the ' other&#xD;
obsequiously, interpreting the thief-&#xD;
taker's meaning; "-in a minute-where&#xD;
is my knife ?-I really-"&#xD;
"Take mine," said the thief-takeras&#xD;
plainly as eyes could speak.&#xD;
"Oh! I see, Mr. Wild; here it is.&#xD;
There you are, Mr. Wild."&#xD;
Jonathan Wild's first speech upon&#xD;
the recovery of his freedom was won-&#xD;
derfully characteristic of the man.&#xD;
"You thick-headed booby !" he cried.&#xD;
*You numskull ! Idgt ! Assf"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Wild; -°-said the man; all&#xD;
humility, "'pon my life, I-&#xD;
" You lying_ jaekanapes, you did!"&#xD;
cried the thief taker, anticipating the&#xD;
man's speech. "You did, yen rascal-&#xD;
you knew that I was there, and jumped&#xD;
upon me intentionally-knocked all the&#xD;
breath out of my body."&#xD;
"I assure you-"&#xD;
" Silence!"&#xD;
"But-"&#xD;
"Cut these infernal cords, unless you&#xD;
like to see me a prisoner."&#xD;
"Certainly, Mr. Wild."&#xD;
" Hal! 0-oh !" cried Jonathan Wild.&#xD;
"You ruffian !'&#xD;
" I'mv ery sorry.'&#xD;
"You lie, you jackanapes!" cried the&#xD;
thief-taker. "You tried to cut me, and&#xD;
you have fully succeeded in your pur-&#xD;
pose-you have cut me to the bone.&#xD;
But hang me if I don't have law of you&#xD;
for it.; 'll cry quits,'or my name isn't&#xD;
Jonathan Wild !"&#xD;
In the space of fye minutes from the&#xD;
appearance of their emarncpator in the&#xD;
tree, the whole party, including the&#xD;
doughty Tom King, were set at liberty.&#xD;
"Now," said Jonathan Wild 'to the&#xD;
new corer, " now, Turnbull, give an&#xD;
account of yourself, where have you&#xD;
been r"&#xD;
"Scouting, as you ordered, Mr. Wild,"&#xD;
r eturned the man.&#xD;
"And why were you not at hand&#xD;
when we needed ,our services 1"&#xD;
"Because I saw that I could be of no&#xD;
service to you in a fight against such&#xD;
odds, and-"&#xD;
"And you actually saw us engaged?"&#xD;
said Mr. Wild in amazement.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
" You hear that, all ?" said the-thief-&#xD;
taker, appealing to his myrmidons and&#xD;
Tom King. "ie.owns having seen us,&#xD;
and yet didn't come forward when he&#xD;
was wanted."Y-*-&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Wild," said the man, " but&#xD;
I reserved myself for this."&#xD;
"Liar !" cried Wild, "I wish you had&#xD;
&#xD;

92                          REDR&#xD;
reserved yourself as you call it alt'-&#xD;
gether, before you had jumped your&#xD;
filthy carcase upon me."&#xD;
The speaker still looked pale from the&#xD;
results of his mishap.&#xD;
" However," continued   Jonathan&#xD;
Wild, "you hear what he says ; just&#xD;
rote it down Jedfries ; I shall want you&#xD;
as a witness when we get back to town;&#xD;
just note down the particulars."&#xD;
The man knew from experience this&#xD;
was like to prove no idle threat, and he&#xD;
already quaked in anticipation of the&#xD;
promised punishment.&#xD;
"-Hadn't we better leave all our little&#xD;
rows for the present, Mr. Wild I" sug-&#xD;
gested Tom King.&#xD;
"As you please," said Wild, assum-&#xD;
ing a bland complaisance, which his&#xD;
men well knew boded no good for the&#xD;
Jsat speaker.&#xD;
* Then, if so," said Tom King, "I do&#xD;
please. Just give up this dispute till a&#xD;
more fitting occasion, and think how&#xD;
we can repay this Captain Ralph for&#xD;
his kind attention. We shall have some&#xD;
of his men looking us up if we are not&#xD;
sharp."&#xD;
Tlhe thief-taker merely nodded his&#xD;
head in token of assent, and was im-&#xD;
mediately lost in a brown study of the&#xD;
matter in hand-vengeance on his late&#xD;
conquerors-a sensation which occupied&#xD;
a large share of his sympathies.&#xD;
"Hark you, Mr. Wild," said Tom&#xD;
King, "I have a proposition to make."&#xD;
"Then let's have it," returned the&#xD;
thief-taker."&#xD;
" What do you think of hunting ou&#xD;
the Yellow Band in their haunts, Mr&#xD;
Wild"                           ..&#xD;
"It cannot be carried out.'&#xD;
"There you are mistaken, Mr. Wild,'&#xD;
said Tom King in a detetwined tone&#xD;
"it can and shall be."&#xD;
"And by whom preyt"&#xD;
"By me."&#xD;
"Single hande ?"&#xD;
The 4)4.f taer looked upon To&#xD;
&#xD;
IALPfl;&#xD;
King with a contemptuous curl of the&#xD;
lip for a few seconds, and then burst&#xD;
out in a derisive mocking laugh.&#xD;
"Laugh on," said Tom King, "but&#xD;
let those laugh who win."'&#xD;
"Mr. Wild," said one of the officers,&#xD;
"I think I hear some one approaching."&#xD;
"Ilah! then we must be brief. Hark&#xD;
you, Mr. Tom King; you are deter-&#xD;
mined to follow up this wild goose&#xD;
chaye . ,"&#xD;
" I am."&#xD;
"And I am half inclined to set my&#xD;
face against it."&#xD;
"Gad ! but that would be a sad pity,"&#xD;
said Tom King, laughing. "And for&#xD;
what reason would .you object?  No&#xD;
nice conisideraion on my behalf, I'll&#xD;
warrant."&#xD;
"'Tis, though," said Wild; "J&#xD;
wouldu't have you come to harm at the&#xD;
hands of Red Ralph or his Yellow Boys,&#xD;
because- .&#xD;
"Finish it, Mr. Wild," said Tom&#xD;
King. "Because of what, pray ."&#xD;
"Because I've sworn to hang you,&#xD;
Toni King," said Wild viciously.&#xD;
"have a care, Jonathan," said King&#xD;
seriously-" have a care."&#xD;
"Pooh! pooh !"&#xD;
"I waru you that I might be tempted&#xD;
to cat your throat."   '&#xD;
Tlhe thief-taker drew back a few&#xD;
paces, and stood between two of his&#xD;
myrmidons.&#xD;
"You hear that, men-you hear that&#xD;
-he threatens to cut my throat. I cell&#xD;
you all to witness that."&#xD;
t The sounds of footsteps, of which one&#xD;
.of the mn had advised the thiief taker&#xD;
a minute or so before, were now audible&#xD;
to all.&#xD;
No time was now to be lost.&#xD;
With a few hurri d words of threat&#xD;
to Tom King, and defiance on the part&#xD;
of the latter, Jonathan Wild disap'&#xD;
peared in the winding of the road fo)&#xD;
lowed by hps five associates.&#xD;
Tom King clambered into the tree&#xD;
m from which the man Turnbull had f'allep&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
ren1.&#xD;
"flush !"&#xD;
The only shaded spot in the glade&#xD;
&#xD;
the arrival of the new comer. =&#xD;
When the individual who had thus&#xD;
alarmed Jonathan Wild and his party&#xD;
appeared in the glade, Torn King per-&#xD;
ceived at a glance that he had met him&#xD;
before,&#xD;
lie was, in effect, Tom King's old&#xD;
enemy Walters, the gallant Lieutenant&#xD;
of the Yellow Band.&#xD;
He bore no traces, of his late tough&#xD;
struggle with Ton King. The' wound&#xD;
wh h he had received was so slight that&#xD;
it had merely sufficed to extract asmuch&#xD;
blood from a vein in his wrist as any&#xD;
ba-rber surgeon of the period -would&#xD;
have let for any mortal ailment with&#xD;
which the lieutenant iight have been&#xD;
afflicted.&#xD;
"I wonder what he'll think to find&#xD;
us all cleared oft," thought Tom King.&#xD;
Whatever the lieutenant might have&#xD;
thought, he did not allow a word to&#xD;
escape him.&#xD;
lie glanced about him at first as if&#xD;
rather surprised, but settled the diffi-&#xD;
culty with a toss of the head, imply-&#xD;
i g, as plainly as a toss of the head&#xD;
could, "Oh, it's all right." -&#xD;
With this he pushed aside the bushes&#xD;
and disappeared in the thicket.&#xD;
After this there -was a low whistled&#xD;
signal, which was presently answered.&#xD;
"That's the way in," murmured Tom&#xD;
£ing in his hiding-place.&#xD;
But he had a very ticklish task to&#xD;
perform in this self-allotted business,&#xD;
and he was determined not to fail from&#xD;
incautiousness.&#xD;
He resolved, therefore, to lie snug&#xD;
for a while.   -&#xD;
The result proved that his caution&#xD;
was not ill timed.&#xD;
In less than five minutes the lieuten-&#xD;
ant reappeared, followed by two of the&#xD;
Yellow Band.&#xD;
"Lieutenant-" began one of the&#xD;

tpon Jonathan Wild, and there awaited leanced to be the identical tree in which&#xD;
&#xD;
Tom King was bidden, and beneath its&#xD;
overhanging boughs the cautions lieu-&#xD;
tenant beckoned his two men to con-&#xD;
verse.&#xD;
'The consequence was that the only&#xD;
mant that they had to fear overheard the&#xD;
whole of what ensued.&#xD;
" Lieutenant," whispered one of the&#xD;
men ; " they iiiust have taken the road&#xD;
to the Miller's Point."&#xD;
"Ay, I'see their tracks plainly, lieu&#xD;
tenant," said the other.&#xD;
" Of course," said the lieutenant;&#xD;
" but the qjuestioii is, how did they&#xD;
contrive to g t free? I saw them&#xD;
bound up my'.self."&#xD;
And I hielicd to do iV."&#xD;
" And I too: and: 1 know very well&#xD;
that the devil himself couldn't have&#xD;
untied the knots."&#xD;
And yet; But stop," said the lieu-&#xD;
tenant; "there's been something down&#xD;
by this tree. Do you see how the leaves&#xD;
are knocked of?"&#xD;
"Yes," said one of the men ; "and&#xD;
here is a branch torn off."&#xD;
Tom King began to experience an&#xD;
uncomfortable sensation.&#xD;
"What does it mean, lieutenant ?"&#xD;
demanded the latter speaker.&#xD;
"It means," replied Walters thought-&#xD;
fully, "that whoever rendered them&#xD;
this assistance was co cealed in this&#xD;
tree."&#xD;
"That's strange."&#xD;
" It is"&#xD;
"Not so very strange, either," re-&#xD;
marked the lieutenant.&#xD;
"Not so?"&#xD;
"No ; didn't you tell me that a fifth&#xD;
man had been seen lurking about the&#xD;
forest ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And that he was recognized for one&#xD;
of Jonathan Wild's men ?"&#xD;
"'Yes."&#xD;
"Then there's the whose exL lanatiol&#xD;

"Curse him."&#xD;
"Hang him ."    .&#xD;
"If I had but known it i" said the&#xD;
former. "I stood under here all the&#xD;
time, too, and he was probably only a sr&#xD;
few feet above my head."           th&#xD;
"I dare say," mentally muttered Tom P&#xD;
King.&#xD;
"If I had only fired into the tree, or t1&#xD;

"Or if thea hadn't escaped," said the b&#xD;

"But it might have gone off, lieu- in&#xD;

"Let's hope it won't now," thought&#xD;
Tom King, slightly alarmed.         q&#xD;
"Regrets   are alike useless  and&#xD;
absurd now," said the lieutenant. "The&#xD;
fact is, we have let them slip through g&#xD;
our angers nicely this time, and there&#xD;
only remains one slight chance of U&#xD;
remedy."&#xD;
"And that is-"&#xD;
"Pursuit."                        t&#xD;
" I'm with youlieutenant."&#xD;
"  I  too."-"&#xD;
"Good," said the lieutenant. "Then t&#xD;
rk with you to the haunt. Put ont&#xD;
your cutlasses, and look to the priming&#xD;
of your laikers."_&#xD;
" All right, hieutenant."&#xD;
"Be suit' anl speedy ; and I can&#xD;
promise you some tough work if you&#xD;
mean fighting."                   -&#xD;
'lee two men responded with a faint&#xD;
cheer, and darted beack into tie bushes,&#xD;
followed by W alters.    .&#xD;
"That's decidedly their haunt, as&#xD;
they call it," nmused Tom King -,;" mnl.&#xD;
I will he' there in a few minutes more.&#xD;
Wait until the coast is clear."&#xD;
He had not long to wait.&#xD;
The lieutenant and his two men,&#xD;
booted and spurred, and armed to the&#xD;
teeth, speedily reappeared through the&#xD;
bushes.&#xD;
&#xD;
"mWhere are the horses." demanded&#xD;
1S lieutenant.&#xD;
"Waiting for us at the Palmer's Cell.&#xD;
an Parker has them."&#xD;
" Call him hither."&#xD;
One of the men signalled, and an an-&#xD;
rering call came faintly along upon&#xD;
e night wind from the direction of the&#xD;
palmer's Cell'&#xD;
A galloping of horses was heard, and.&#xD;
tree fine-looking hacks were trotted&#xD;
to the glade by one of the Yellow Band.&#xD;
"here, Parker," said the lieutenant,&#xD;
ekoning the man.&#xD;
He placed his hands lightly upon the&#xD;
eck of one of the horses, and vaulted&#xD;
nto the saddle with all the grace and&#xD;
ase of an accomplished equestrian.&#xD;
"Now then, my men," said he, "be&#xD;
uik. To horse and away "&#xD;
"Ay, ay, lieutenant."&#xD;
"They cannot have made much pro-&#xD;
ress a-foot. Forward !"&#xD;
And the three horseman centered out&#xD;
if the glade.&#xD;
"So much for them," said trom King,&#xD;
once more at his ease. "And now for&#xD;
he haunt of the Y flow Band."&#xD;
He scrambled out of the tree, and,&#xD;
made his way at once to the part of the&#xD;
thicket from which the. lieutenant and&#xD;
two men had emerged.&#xD;
Iere, how':ver, he began with a great&#xD;
difieiulty. The shrubs had been twined&#xD;
in such a way that the entrance was&#xD;
almost inaccessible to one of the un-&#xD;
mi Rated.&#xD;
ButTom King was not the man to be&#xD;
baffled by a tritline obstacle when he&#xD;
had set his mid upon accomplishing a&#xD;
dilheu ty.&#xD;
U.n tore such of the bushes away,&#xD;
trro, as impeded his progress, and&#xD;
in doing so, sadly hcer *ted his hands,&#xD;
and helt a bleeding track behind him.&#xD;
But his purpose was accouplished,&#xD;
and he had pased the first barrier.r.&#xD;
"That's over," ieamuttered, as he&#xD;
paiuset awhile to breathe, for his exer-&#xD;
tios had been     no mev    of the&#xD;

Aghtest. "I'm sorry that I knocked it&#xD;
aiout so--it would leave a track to a&#xD;
Mnarp-slghted fellow.'If that lieutenant,&#xD;
uathey call him, or Red Ralph himself&#xD;
were to return, I niight consider myself&#xD;
ts good as departed this existence."&#xD;
For half an hour did Tom King do&#xD;
battle bravely with briar, thorn, and&#xD;
ticket, and at the expiration of ttat&#xD;
wne paused to rest at the foot of a tree-&#xD;
tartp, not three minutes' walk from&#xD;
ale starting-point.&#xD;
Although shut in on every side by&#xD;
.rs, bushes, and shrubs, this tree had&#xD;
apparently been struck down by light-&#xD;
aurg, whilst all the vegetation about had&#xD;
escaped unscathed.&#xD;
"Singular,". muttered  Tom  King,&#xD;
"that the electric fluid should have&#xD;
stngled out this old fellow; and I'll&#xD;
warrant he has no sapling."&#xD;
In the examination of the tree he was&#xD;
dandling it rather roughly, and he&#xD;
ncied he felt it move:&#xD;
Impossible! and yet--hah !"&#xD;
He pushed heavily against it, and this&#xD;
6 there was nodoubt as to its hay-&#xD;
ng shifted several inches.&#xD;
.eewn his .exertions, he had the&#xD;
iatiafaction of pushing the tree-stump&#xD;
eack, discovering an aperture sufficient-&#xD;
ly large to admit the passage of an or-&#xD;
4.inay-seized wan with ease.&#xD;
-'b blasted tree formed a kind of cap,&#xD;
severing to the bole, one side of it being&#xD;
faster.d to the ground by hinges.&#xD;
"chance has no doubt discovered for&#xD;
me what I might have sought fort&#xD;
sterhiisy and failed to find," nused To i&#xD;
iing. "This is--must be the entrance&#xD;
io the haunt of the Yellow Band. But&#xD;
.t looks phinguey dark."&#xD;
And it did iu'l'ed look dark. It was&#xD;
xo small proof of Ton King's courage&#xD;
mat he pursued his scheme beyond this&#xD;
yomt.&#xD;
Smothering his qualms as they arose,&#xD;
he sat flown, passed his legs through&#xD;
the dark aperture, and let himself&#xD;
gradually down.&#xD;
&#xD;
He commenced restin     upon  his&#xD;
elbows,. but, -sti etelr as 'he would, hii&#xD;
feet could find no landingplace.&#xD;
"And yet there must be," he mutter-&#xD;
ed. "I must risk it."&#xD;
He let him-elf down to the full extent-&#xD;
of his reach, and his foot kicked some&#xD;
post or pillar !&#xD;
"What can this be ". he thought, as&#xD;
he rested his foot upon the moveable&#xD;
support; "surely not a stepping-stone?&#xD;
No ian would t uest himself to such a&#xD;
place in this pitch darkness."&#xD;
As he kicked about he felt that the&#xD;
place was hollow from two or three feet&#xD;
below the surface of the soil.&#xD;
Presently, growing bolder, he re-&#xD;
leased the hool of the left hand and&#xD;
lowered it into the aperture, feeling for&#xD;
some further hold, whist with his right&#xD;
hand, and the slight rest from this in-&#xD;
visible projection at the bottom of the&#xD;
pit, he contrived to support himself.&#xD;
As he had coujectured; he was not&#xD;
ong in placing his foot upon a 'huge&#xD;
wooden staple.&#xD;
" I'm getting at it by. degrees,"' he&#xD;
murmured, hop#elly; "it is, certain&#xD;
that I' am upon the .right track now.&#xD;
This secret entrance-has-no been formed&#xD;
without soe reason, and good ,reason&#xD;
too.''&#xD;

"A few steps further brought him to a&#xD;
