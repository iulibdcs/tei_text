            <head type="sub">TO ROBERT CARTER, ESQ.</head>
            <p>NOT the intrinsic merits of this story embolden me to inscribe it to you, my dear
               friend; but the fact that you, more than any other man, are responsible for its
               writing. Your advice and encouragement first led me to book-making; so it is only
               fair that you should partake of whatever obloquy (or honor) the practice may bring
               upon me.</p>
            <p>The ensuing pages may incline you to suspect their author of a repugnance to
               unvarnished truth; but,—without prejudice to Othello,—since varnish brings out in
               wood veins of beauty invisible before the application, why not also in the sober
               facts of life? When the transparent artifice has been penetrated, the familiar
               substance underneath will be greeted none the less kindly; nay, the observer will
               perhaps regard the disguise as an oblique. compliment to his powers of insight, and
               his attention may thus be better secured than had the subject worn its every-day
               dress. Seriously, the most matter-of-fact life has moods when the light of romance
               seems to gild its earthen chimney-pots into fairy minarets; and, were the
               story-teller but sure of laying his hands upon the true gold, perhaps the more his
               story had of it, the better.</p>
            <p>Here, however, comes in the grand difficulty; fact nor<pb n="6-7"
                  xml:id="VAC6660-00000004"/> fancy is often reproduced in true colors; and while
               attempting justly to combine life's elements, the writer has to beware that they be
               not mere cheap imitations thereof. Not seldom does it happen that what he proffers as
               genuine arcana of imagination and philosophy affects the reader as a dose of
               Hieroglyphics and Balderdash. Nevertheless, the first duty of the fiction-monger—no
               less than of the photographic artist doomed to produce successful portraits of
               children-in-arms—is, to be amusing; to shrink at no shifts which shall beguile the
               patient into procrastinating escape until the moment be gone by. The gentle reader
               will not too sternly set his face against such artifices, but, so they go not the
               length of fantastically presenting phenomena inexplicable upon any common-sense
               hypothesis, he will rather lend himself to his own beguilement. The performance once
               over, let him, if so inclined, strip the feathers from the flights of imagination,
               and wash the color from the incidents; if aught save the driest and most ordinary
               matters of fact reward his researches, then let him be offended!</p>
            <p>
               <foreign xml:lang="LAT">De te fabula</foreign> does not apply here, my dear friend;
               for you will show me more indulgence than I have skill to demand. And should you find
               matter of interest in this book, yours, rather than the author's, will be the merit.
               As the beauty of nature is from the eye that looks upon her, so would the story be
               dull and barren, save for the life and color of the reader's sympathy.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE ENCHANTED RING.</head>
               <p>ONE of the most imposing buildings in Boston twenty years ago was a granite hotel,
                  whose western windows looked upon a graveyard. Passing up a flight of steps, and
                  beneath a portico of dignified granite columns, and so through an embarrassing
                  pair of swinging-doors to the roomy vestibule,—you would there pause a moment to
                  spit upon the black-and-white tessellated pavement. Having thus asserted your
                  title to Puritan ancestry, and to the best accommodations the house afforded, you
                  would approach the desk and write your name in the hotel register. This done, you
                  would be apt to run your eye over the last dozen arrivals, on the chance of
                  lighting upon the autograph of some acquaintance, to be shunned or sought
                  according to circumstances.</p>
               <p>Let us suppose, for the story's sake, that such was the gentle reader's behavior
                  on a certain night during<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6660-00000005"/> the latter part
                  of May, in the year eighteen hundred and fifty-three. If now he will turn to the
                  ninety-ninth page of the register above mentioned, he will remark that the last
                  name thereon written is, "Doctor Hiero Glyphic. Room 27." The natural inference is
                  that, unless so odd a name be an assumed one, Doctor Glyphic occupies that room.
                  Passing on to page one hundred, he will find the first entry reads as follows:
                  "Balder Helwyse, Cosmopolis. Room 29."</p>
               <p>In no trifling mood do we call attention to these two names, and, above all, to
                  their relative position in the book. Had they both appeared upon the same page,
                  this romance might never have been written. On such seemingly frail pegs hang
                  consequences the most weighty. Because Doctor Glyphic preferred the humble foot of
                  the ninety-ninth page to the trouble of turning to a leading position on the one
                  hundredth; because Mr. Helwyse, having begun the one hundredth page, was too
                  incurious to find out who was his next-door neighbor on the ninety-ninth, ensued
                  unparalleled adventures, and this account of them.</p>
               <p>Our present purpose, by the reader's leave, and in his company, is to violate
                  Doctor Hiero Glyphic's retirement, as he lies asleep in bed. Nor shall we stop at
                  his bedside; we mean to penetrate deep into the darksome caves of his memory, and
                  to drag forth thence sundry odd-looking secrets, which shall blink and look
                  strangely in the light of discovery;—little thought their keeper that our eyes
                  should ever behold them! Yet will he not resent our intrusion; it is twenty years
                  ago,—and he lies asleep.</p>
               <p>Two o'clock sounds from the neighboring steeple of the Old South Church, as we
                  noiselessly enter the chamber,—noiselessly, for the hush of the past is about us.
                  We scarcely distinguish anything at first; the moon has set on the other side of
                  the hotel, and perhaps, too, some of the dimness of those twenty intervening years
                  affects our eyesight. By degrees, however, objects begin to define themselves; the
                  bed shows doubtfully white, and that dark blot upon the pillow must be the face of
                  our sleeping man. It is turned towards the window; the mouth is open; probably the
                  good Doctor is snoring, albeit, across this distance of time, the sound fails to
                  reach us.</p>
               <p>The room is as bare, square, and characterless as other hotel rooms; nevertheless,
                  its occupant may have left a hint or two of himself about, which would be of use
                  to us. There are no trunks or other luggage; evidently he will be on his way again
                  to-morrow. The window is shut, although the night is warm and clear. The door is
                  carefully locked. The Doctor's garments, which appear to be of rather a jaunty and
                  knowing cut, are lying disorderly about, on chair, table, or floor. He carries no
                  watch; but under his<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6660-00000006"/> pillow we see
                  protruding the corner of a great leathern pocket-book, which might contain a
                  fortune in bank-notes.</p>
               <p>A couple of chairs are drawn up to the bedside, upon one of which stands a
                  blown-out candle; the other supports an oblong, coffin-shaped box, narrower at one
                  end than at the other, and painted black. Too small for a coffin, however; no
                  human corpse, at least, is contained in it. But the frame that lies so quiet and
                  motionless here, thrills, when awaked to life, with a soul only less marvellous
                  than man's. In short, the coffin is a violin-case, and the mysterious frame the
                  violin. The Doctor must have been fiddling overnight, after getting into bed; to
                  the dissatisfaction, perhaps, of his neighbor on the other side of the
                  partition.</p>
               <p>Little else in the room is worthy notice, unless it be the pocket-comb which has
                  escaped from the Doctor's waistcoat, and the shaving materials (also pocketable)
                  upon the wash-stand. Apparently our friend does not stand upon much toilet
                  ceremony. The room has nothing more of significance to say to us; so now we come
                  to the room's occupant. Our eyes have got enough accustomed to the imperfect light
                  to discern what manner of man he may be.</p>
               <p>Barely middle-aged; or, at a second glance, he might be fifteen to twenty-five
                  years older. His face retains the form of youth, yet wears a subtile shadow which
                  we feel might be consistent even with extreme old age. The forehead is wide and
                  low, supported by regular eyebrows; the face beneath long and narrow, of a dark
                  and dry complexion. In sleep, open-mouthed, the expression is rather inane; though
                  we can readily imagine the waking face to be not devoid of a certain intensity and
                  comeliness of aspect, marred, however, by an air of guarded anxiety which is
                  apparent even now.</p>
               <p>We prattle of the dead past, and use to fancy that peace must dwell there, if
                  nothing else. Only in the past, say we, is security from jostle, danger, and
                  disturbance; who would live at his ease must number his days backwards; no charm
                  so potent as the years, if read from right to left. Living in, the past, prophecy
                  and memory are at one; care for the future can harass no man. Throw overboard that
                  Jonah, Time, and the winds of fortune shall cease to buffet us. And more to the
                  same effect.</p>
               <p>And yet it is not so. The past, if more real than the future, is no less so than
                  the present; the pain of a broken heart or head is never annihilated, but becomes
                  part and parcel of eternity. This uneasy snorer here, for instance: his earthly
                  troubles have been over years ago, yet, as our fancy sees him, he is none the
                  calmer or the happier for that. Observe him, how he mumbles inarticulately, and
                  makes strengthless clutchings at the blanket with his long, slender fingers.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6660-00000007"/>
               <p>But we delay too long over the external man, seeing that our avowed business is
                  with the internal. A sleeping man is truly a helpless creature. They say that, if
                  you take his hand in yours and ask him questions, he has no other choice than to
                  answer—or to awake. The Doctor—as we know by virtue of the prophetic advantages
                  just remarked upon—will stay asleep for some hours yet. Or, if you are
                  clairvoyant, you have but to fall in a trance, and lay a hand on his forehead, and
                  you may read off his thoughts,—provided he does his thinking in his head. But the
                  world is growing too wise, nowadays, to put faith in old woman's nonsense like
                  this. Again, there is—or used to be—an odd theory that all matter is a sort of
                  photographic plate, whereon is registered, had we but eyes to read it, the
                  complete history of itself. What an invaluable pair of eyes were that! In vain,
                  arraigned before them, would the criminal deny his guilt, the lover the soft
                  impeachment. The whole scene would stand forth, photographed in fatal minuteness
                  and indelibility upon face, hands, coat-sleeve, shirt-bosom. Mankind would be its
                  own book of life, written in the primal hieroglyphic character,—the language
                  understood by all. Vocal conversation would become obsolete, unless among a few
                  superior persons able to discuss abstract ideas.</p>
               <p>We speak of these things only to smile at them; far be it from us to insult the
                  reader's understanding by asking him to regard them seriously. But story-tellers
                  labor under one disadvantage which is peculiar to their profession,—the necessity
                  of omniscience. This tends to make them too arbitrary, leads them to disregard the
                  modesty of nature and the harmonies of reason in their methods. They will pretend
                  to know things which they never could have seen or heard of, and for the truth of
                  which they bring forward no evidence; thus forcing the reader to reject, as
                  lacking proper confirmation, what he would else, from its inherent grace or
                  sprightliness, be happy to accept.</p>
               <p>That we shall be free from this reproach is rather our good fortune than our
                  merit. It is by favor of our stars, not by virtue of our own, that we turn not
                  aside from the plain path of truth to the by-ways of super-naturalism and
                  improbability. Yet we refrain with difficulty from a breath of self-praise; there
                  is a proud and solid satisfaction in holding an unassailable position; could we
                  but catch the world's eye, we would meet it calmly!</p>
               <p>Let us hasten to introduce our talisman. You may see it at this very moment,
                  encircling the third finger of Doctor Glyphic's left hand; in fact, it is neither
                  more nor less than a quaint diamond ring. The stone, though not surprisingly
                  large, is surpassingly pure and brilliant; as its keen, delicate ray sparkles on
                     the<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6660-00000008"/> eye, one marvels whence, in the
                  dead of night, it got together so much celestial fire. Observe the setting; the
                  design is unique. Two fairy serpents—one golden, the other fashioned from black
                  meteoric iron—are intertwined along their entire length, forming the hoop of the
                  ring. Their heads approach the diamond from opposite sides, and each makes a
                  mighty bite at it with his tiny jaws, studded with sharp little teeth. Thus their
                  contest holds the stone firmly in place. The whole forms a pretty symbol of the
                  human soul, battled for by the good and the evil principles. But the diamond
                  seems, in its entirety, to be an awkward mouthful for either. The snakes are
                  wrought with marvellous dexterity and finish; each separate scale is
                  distinguishable upon their glistening bodies, the wrinkling of the skin in the
                  coils, the sparkling points of eyes, and the minute nostrils. Such works of art
                  are not made nowadays; the ring is an antique,—a relic of an age when skill was
                  out of all proportion to liberty,—a very distant time indeed. To deserve such a
                  setting, the stone must have exceptional qualities. Let us take a closer look at
                  it.</p>
               <p>Fortunately, its own lustre makes it visible in every part; the minuteness of our
                  scrutiny need be limited only by our power of eye. It is cut with many
                  facets,—twenty-seven, if you choose to count them; perhaps (though we little
                  credit such fantasies) some mystic significance may be intended in this number.
                  Concentrating now our attention upon any single facet, we see—either inscribed
                  upon its surface, or showing through from the interior of the stone—a sort of
                  monogram, or intricately designed character, not unlike the mysterious Chinese
                  letters on tea-chests. Every facet has a similar figure, though no two are
                  identical. But the central, the twenty-seventh facet, which is larger than the
                  others, has an important peculiarity. Looking upon it, we find therein,
                  concentrated and commingled, the other twenty-six characters; which, separately
                  unintelligible, form, when thus united, a simple and consistent narrative,
                  equivalent in extent to many hundred printed pages, and having for subject nothing
                  less than the complete history of the ring itself.</p>
               <p>Some small portion of this narrative—that, namely, which relates more particularly
                  to the present wearer of the ring—we will glance at; the rest must be silence,
                  although, going back as it does to the earliest records of the human race, many an
                  interesting page must be skipped perforce.</p>
               <p>The advantages to a historian of a medium such as this are too patent to need
                  pointing out. Pretension and conjecture will be avoided, because unnecessary. The
                  most trifling thought or deed of any person connected with the history of the ring
                  is laid open to<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6660-00000009"/> direct inspection. Were
                  there more such talismans as this, the profession of authorship would become no
                  less easy than delightful, and criticism would sting itself to death, in despair
                  of better prey. So far as is known, however, the enchanted ring is unique of its
                  kind, and, such as it is, is not likely to become common property.</p>

               <head type="sub">OUT OF EGYPT.</head>
               <p>BUT the small hours of the morning are slipping away; we must construe our
                  hieroglyphics without further palaver. The sleeper lies upon his side, his left
                  hand resting near his face upon the pillow. Were he to move it ever so little
                  during our examination, the history of years might be thrown into confusion.
                  Nevertheless, we shall hope to touch upon all the more important points, and in
                  some cases to go into details.</p>
               <p>Concentrating our attention upon the central facet, its clear ray strikes the
                  imagination, and forthwith transports us to a distant age and climate. The air is
                  full of lazy warmth. A full-fed river, glassing the hot blue sky, slides in long
                  curves through a low-lying, illimitable plain. The rich earth, green with mighty
                  crops, everywhere exhales upward the quivering heat of her breath. An indolent,
                  dark-skinned race, turbaned and scantly clothed, move through the meadows, splash
                  in the river, and rest beneath the palm-trees, which meet in graceful clusters
                  here and there, as if<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6660-00000010"/> striving to get
                  beneath one another's shadow. Dirty villages swarm and babble on the river's
                  brink.</p>
               <p>Were there leisure to listen, the diamond could readily relate the whole history
                  of this famous valley. For the stone was fashioned to its present shape while the
                  thought that formed the Pyramids was yet unborn, and while the limestone and
                  granite whereof they are built lay in their silent beds, dreaming, perchance, of
                  airy days before the deluge, long ere the heated vapors stiffened into stone. Some
                  great patriarch of early days, founder of a race called by his name, picked up
                  this diamond in the southern desert, and gave it its present form; perhaps, also,
                  breathed into it the marvellous historical gift which it retains to this day. Who
                  was that primal man? how sounded his voice? were his eyes terrible, or mild?
                  Seems, as we speak, we glimpse his majestic figure, and the grandeur of his face
                  and cloudy beard.</p>
               <p>He passed away, but the enchanted stone remained, and has sparkled along the
                  splendid march of successive dynasties, and has reflected men and cities which to
                  us are nameless, or but a half-deciphered name. It has seen the mystic ceremonies
                  of Egyptian priests, and counts their boasted wisdom as a twice-told tale. It has
                  watched the unceasing toil of innumerable slaves, piling up through many ardent
                  years the idle tombs of kings. It has beheld vast winding lengths of processions
                  cessions darken and glitter across the plain, slowly devoured by the shining city,
                  or issuing from her gates like a monstrous birth.</p>
               <p>But whither wander we? Standing in this hotel of modern Boston, we must confine
                  our inquiries to a far later epoch than the Pharaohs'. Step aside, and let the old
                  history sweep past, like the turbid and eddying current of the mysterious Nile;
                  forbearing to launch our skiff earlier than at the beginning of the present
                  century.</p>
               <p>The middle of June, eighteen hundred and sixteen: the river is just beginning to
                  rise, and the thirsty land spreads wide her lap to receive him. Some miles to the
                  north slumbers Cairo in white heat, its outline jagged with minarets and bulbous
                  domes. Southward, the shaded Pyramids print their everlasting outlines against the
                  tremulous distance; old as they are, it seems as though a puff of the Khamsin
                  might dissolve them away. Near at hand is a noisy, naked crowd of men and boys,
                  plunging and swimming in the water, or sitting and standing along the bank. They
                  are watching and discussing the slow approach up stream of a large boat with a
                  broad lateen-sail and a strange flag fluttering from the mast-head. Rumor says
                  that this boat contains a company of strangers from beyond the sea; men who do not
                  wear turbans, whose dress is close-fitting, and covers<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000011"/> them from head to foot,—even the legs. They come to
                  learn wisdom and civilization from the Pyramids, and among the ruins of
                  Memphis.</p>
               <p>A hundred yards below this shouting, curious crowd, stands, waist-deep in the
                  Nile, a slender-limbed boy, about ten years old. He belongs to a superior caste,
                  and holds himself above the common rabble. Being perfectly naked, a careless eye
                  might, however, rank him with the rest, were it not for the talisman which he
                  wears suspended to a fine gold chain round his neck; a curiously designed diamond
                  ring, the inheritance of a long line of priestly ancestors. The boy's face is
                  certainly full of intelligence, and the features are finely moulded for so young a
                  lad.</p>
               <p>He also is watching the upward progress of the lateen-sail; has heard, moreover,
                  the report concerning those on board. He wonders where is the country from which
                  they come. Is it the land the storks fly to, of which mother (before the plague
                  carried both her and father to a stranger land still) used to tell such wonderful
                  stories? Does the world really extend far beyond the valley? Is the world all
                  valley and river, with now and then some hills, like those away up beyond Memphis?
                  Are there other cities beside Cairo, and that one which he has heard of but never
                  seen,—Alexandria? Wonders why the strangers dress in tight-fitting clothes, with
                  leg-coverings, and without turbans! Would like to find out about all these
                  things,—about all things knowable beside these, if any there be. Would like to go
                  back with the strangers to their country, when they return, and so become the
                  wisest and most powerful of his race; wiser even than those fabulously learned
                  priestly instructors of his, who are so strict with him. Perhaps he might find all
                  his forefathers there, and his kind mother, who used to tell him stories.</p>
               <p>Bah! how the sun blisters down on head and shoulders: will take a dive and a
                  swim,—a short swim only, not far from shore; for was not the priest telling of a
                  boy caught by a great crocodile, only a few days ago, and never seen since? But
                  there is no crocodile near to-day; and, besides, will not his precious talisman
                  keep him from all harm?</p>
               <p>The subtile Nile catches him softly in his cool arms, dandles him, kisses him,
                  flatters him, wooes him imperceptibly onwards. Now he is far from shore, and the
                  multitudinous feet of the current are hurrying him away. The slow-moving boat is
                  much nearer than it was a minute ago,—seems to be rushing towards him, in spite of
                  the laziness of the impelling breeze. The boy, as yet unconscious of his peril,
                  now glances shorewards, and sees the banks wheel past. The crowd of bathers is
                  already far beyond hearing; yet, frightened and tired, he wastes his remaining
                  strength in<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6660-00000012"/> fruitless shouts. Now the
                  deceitful eddies, once so soft and friendly, whirl him down in ruthless
                  exultation. He will never reach the shore, good swimmer though he be!</p>
               <p>Hark! what plunged from the bank,—what black thing moves towards him across the
                  water? The crocodile! coming with tears in his eyes, and a long grin of serried
                  teeth. Coming!—the ugly scaly head is always nearer and nearer. The boy screams;
                  but who should hear him? He feels whether the talisman be yet round his neck. He
                  screams again, calling, in half-delirium, upon his dead mother. Meanwhile the
                  scaly snout is close upon him.</p>
               <p>A many-voiced shout, close at hand; a splashing of poles in the water; a rippling
                  of eddies against a boat's bows! As the boy drifts by, a blue-eyed, yellow-bearded
                  viking swings himself from the halyard, catches him, pulls him aboard with a jerk
                  and a shout, safe! The long grin snaps emptily together behind him. The boy lies
                  on the deck, a vision of people with leg-coverings and other oddities of costume
                  swimming in his eyes; one of them supports his head on his knee, and bends over
                  him a round, good-natured, spectacled face. Above, a beautiful flag, striped and
                  starred with white, blue, and red, flaps indolently against the mast.—</p>
               <p>Precisely at this point the sleeper stirs his hand slightly, but enough to throw
                  the record of several succeeding years into uncertainty and confusion. Here and
                  there, however, we catch imperfect glimpses of the Egyptian lad, steadily growing
                  up to be a tall young man. He is dressed in European clothes, and lives and moves
                  amid civilized surroundings: Egypt, with her Pyramids, palms, and river, we see no
                  more. The priest's son seems now to be immersed in studies; he shows a genius for
                  music and painting, and is diligently storing his mind with other than Egyptian
                  lore. With him, or never far away, we meet a man considerably older than the
                  student,—good-natured, whimsical, round of head and face and insignificant of
                  feature. Towards him does the student observe the profoundest deference, bowing
                  before him, and addressing him as "Master Hiero," or "Master Glyphic." Master
                  Hiero, for his part, calls the Egyptian "Manetho"; from which we might infer his
                  descent from the celebrated historian of that name, but will not insist upon this
                  genealogy. As for the studies, from certain signs we fancy them tending towards
                  theology; the descendant of Egyptian priests is to become a Christian clergyman!
                  Nevertheless, he still wears his talismanic ring. Does he believe it saved him
                  from the crocodile? Does his Christian enlightenment not set him free from such
                  superstition?</p>
               <p>So much we piece together from detached glimpses;<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000013"/> but now, as the magic ray steadies once more,
                  things become again distinct. Judging from the style and appointments of Master
                  Hiero Glyphic's house, he is a wealthy man, and eccentric as well. It is full of
                  strange incongruities and discords; beauties in abundance, but ill harmonized. One
                  half the house is built like an Egyptian temple, and is enriched with many spoils
                  from the valley of the Nile; and here a secret chamber is set apart for Manetho;
                  its very existence is known to no one save himself and Master Hiero. He spends
                  much of his time here, meditating and working amidst his books and papers, playing
                  on his violin, or leaning idly back in his chair, watching the sunlight, through
                  the horizontal aperture high above his head, creep stealthily across the opposite
                  wall.</p>
               <p>But these saintly and scholarly reveries are disturbed anon. Master Hiero, though
                  a bachelor, has a half-sister, a pale, handsome, indolent young woman, with dark
                  hair and eyes, and a rather haughty manner. Helen appears, and thenceforth the
                  household lives and breathes according to her languid bidding. Manetho comes out
                  of his retirement, and dances reverential attendance upon her. He is twenty-five
                  years old, now; tall, slender, and far from ill-looking, with his dark, narrow
                  eyes, wide brows, and tapering face. His manners are gentle, subdued, insinuating,
                  and altogether he seems to please Helen; she condescends to him,—more than
                  condescends, perhaps. Meantime, alas! there is a secret opposition in progress,
                  embodied in the shapely person of that bright-eyed gypsy of a girl whom her
                  mistress Helen calls Salome. There is no question as to Salome's complete
                  subjection to the attractions of the young embryo clergyman; she pursues him with
                  eyes and heart, and, seeing him by Helen's side, she is miserably but dumbly
                  jealous.</p>
               <p>How is this matter to end? Manetho's devotion to Helen seems unwavering; yet
                  sometimes it is hard not to suspect a secret understanding between him and Salome.
                  He has ceased to wear his ring, and once we caught a diamond-sparkle from beneath
                  the thick folds of lace which cover Helen's bosom; but, on the other hand, we fear
                  his arm has been round the gypsy's graceful waist, and that she has learnt the
                  secret of the private chamber. Is demure Manetho a flirt, or do his affections and
                  his ambition run counter to each other? Helen would bring him the riches of this
                  world,—but what should a clergyman care for such vanities?—while Salome, to our
                  thinking, is far the prettier, livelier, and more attractive woman of the two.
                  Brother Hiero, whimsical and preoccupied, sees nothing of what is going on. He is
                  an antiquary,—an Egyptologist, and thereto his soul is wedded. He has no eyes nor
                  ears for the loves of other people for one another.—</p>
               <p>Provoking! The uneasy sleeper has moved again,<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000014"/> and disorganized, beyond remedy, the events of a
                  whole year. Judging from such fragments as reach us, it must have been a momentous
                  epoch in our history. From the beginning, a handsome, stalwart, blue-eyed man,
                  with a great beard like a sheaf of straw, shoulders upon the scene, and
                  thenceforth becomes inextricably mixed up with dark-eyed Helen. We recognize in
                  him an old acquaintance; he was on the lateen-sailed boat that went up the Nile;
                  it was he who swung himself from the vessel's side, and pulled Manetho out of the
                  jaws of death,—a fact, by the way, of which Manetho remained ignorant until his
                  dying day. With this new arrival, Helen's supremacy in the household ends. Thor—so
                  they call him—involuntarily commands her, and so her subjects. Against him, the
                  Reverend Manetho has not the ghost of a chance. To his credit is it that he
                  conceals whatever emotions of disappointment or jealousy he might be supposed to
                  feel, and is no less winning towards Thor than towards the rest of the world. But
                  is it possible that the talisman still hides in Helen's bosom? Does the conflict
                  which it symbolizes beset her heart?</p>
               <p>The enchanted mirror is still again, and a curious scene is reflected from it. A
                  large and lofty room, windowless, lit by flaring lamps hung at intervals round the
                  walls; the panels contain carvings in bas-relief of Egyptian emblems and devices;
                  columns surround round the central space, their capitals carved with the
                  lotos-flower, their bases planted amidst papyrus leaves. A border of hieroglyphic
                  inscription encircles the walls, just beneath the ceiling. In each corner of the
                  room rests a red granite sarcophagus, and between each pair of pillars stands a
                  mummy in its wooden case. At that end farthest from the low-browed doorway—which
                  is guarded by two great figures of Isis and Osiris, sitting impassive, with hands
                  on knees—is raised an altar of black marble, on which burns some incense. The
                  perfumed smoke, wavering upwards, mingles with that of the lamps beneath the high
                  ceiling. The prevailing color is ruddy Indian-red, relieved by deep blue and
                  black, while brighter tints show here and there. Blocks of polished stone pave the
                  floor, and dimly reflect the lights.</p>
               <p>In front of the altar stands a ministerial figure,—none other than Manetho, who
                  must have taken orders,—and joins together, in holy matrimony, the yellow-bearded
                  Thor and the dark-haired Helen. Master Hiero, his round, snub-nosed face red with
                  fussy emotion, gives the bride away; while Salome, dressed in white and looking
                  very pretty and lady-like, does service as bridesmaid,—such is her mistress's
                  whim. She seems in even better spirits than the pale bride, and her black eyes
                  scarcely wander from the minister's rapt countenance.</p>
               <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6660-00000015"/>
               <p>But a few hours later, when bride and groom are gone, Salome,—who, on some
                  plausible pretext of her own, has been allowed to remain with brother Hiero until
                  her mistress returns from the wedding-tour,—Salome appears in the secret chamber,
                  where the Reverend Manetho sits with his head between his hands. We will not look
                  too closely at this interview. There are words fierce and tender, tears and
                  pleadings, feverish caresses, incoherent promises, distrustful bargains; and it is
                  late before they part. Salome passes out through the great tomb-like hall, where
                  all the lamps save one are burnt out; and the young minister remains to pursue his
                  holy meditations alone.</p>
               <p>We are too discreet to meddle with the honeymoon; but, passing over some eight
                  months, behold the husband and wife returned, to plume their wings ere taking the
                  final flight. Another strange scene attracts us here.</p>
               <p>The dusk of a summer evening. Helen, with a more languid step and air than before
                  marriage, saunters along a path through the trees, some distance from the house.
                  She is clad in loose-flowing drapery, and has thrown a white shawl over her head
                  and shoulders. Reaching a bench of rustic woodwork, she drops weariedly down upon
                  it.</p>
               <p>Manetho comes out all at once, and stands before her; he seems to have darkened
                  together from the shadow of the surrounding trees. Perhaps a little startled at
                  his so abrupt appearance, she opens her eyes with a wondering haughtiness; but, at
                  the same time, the light pressure of the enchanted ring against her bosom feels
                  like a dull sting, and her heart beats uncomfortably. He begins to speak in his
                  usual tone of softest deference; he sits down by her, and now she is paler,
                  glances anxiously up the path for her delaying husband, and the hand that lifts
                  her handkerchief to her lips trembles a little. Is it at his words? or at their
                  tone? or at what she sees lurking behind his dusky eyes, curdling beneath his
                  thin, dark skin, quivering down to the tips of his long, slender fingers?</p>
               <p>All in a moment he bursts forth, without warning, without restraint, the fire of
                  the Egyptian sun boiling in his blood and blazing in his passion. He seizes her
                  soft white wrist,—then her waist; he presses against his, her bosom,—what a
                  throbbing!—her cheek to his,—how aghast! He pours hot words in torrents into her
                  ears,—all that his fretting heart has hoarded up and brooded over these months and
                  years! all,—sparing her not a thought, not a passionate word. She tries to repel
                  him, to escape, to scream for help; but he looks down her eyes with his own, holds
                  her fast, and she gasps for breath. So the serpent coils about the dove, and
                  stamps his image upon her bewildered brain.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6660-00000016"/>
               <p>Verily, the Reverend Manetho has much forgotten himself. The issue might have been
                  disastrous, had not Helen, in the crisis of the affair, lost consciousness, and
                  fallen a dead weight in his arms. He laid her gently on the bench, fumbled for a
                  moment in the bosom of her dress, and drew out the diamond ring. Just then is
                  heard the solid step of Thor, striding and whistling along the path. Manetho snaps
                  the golden chain, and vanishes with his talisman; and he is the first to appear,
                  full of sympathy and concern, when the distracted husband shouts for help.</p>
               <p>Next morning, two little struggling human beings are blinking and crying in a
                  darkened room, and there is no mother to give them milk, and cherish them in her
                  bosom. There sits the father, almost as still and cold as what was his wife. She
                  did not speak to him, nor seem to know him, to the last. He will never know the
                  truth; Manetho comes and goes, and reads the burial-service, unsuspected and
                  unpunished. But Salome follows him away from the grave, and some words pass
                  between them. The man is no longer what he was. He turns suddenly upon her and
                  strikes out with savage force; the diamond on his finger bites into the flesh of
                  the gypsy's breast; she will carry the scar of that brutal blow as long as she
                  lives. So he drove his only lover away, and looked upon her bright, handsome face
                  no more.</p>
               <p>Here Doctor Glyphic—or whoever this sleeping man may be—turns heavily upon his
                  face, drawing his hand, with the blood-stained ring, out of sight. We are glad to
                  leave him to his bad dreams; the air oppresses us. Come, 't is time we were off.
                  The eastern horizon bows before the sun, the air colors delicate pink, and the
                  very tombstones in the graveyard blush for sympathy. The sparrows have been awake
                  for a half-hour past, and, up aloft, the clouds, which wander ceaselessly over the
                  face of the earth, alighting only on lonely mountain-tops, are tinted into
                  rainbow-quarries by the glorious spectacle.</p>

               <p>KING ARTHUR, in his Bohemian days, carried an adamantine shield, the gift of some
                  fairy relative. Not only was it impenetrable, but, so intolerable was its lustre,
                  it overthrew all foes before the lance's point could reach them. Observing this,
                  the chivalric monarch had a cover made for it, which he never removed save in the
                  face of superhuman odds.</p>
               <p>Here is an analogy. The imaginative reader may look upon our enchanted
                  facet-mirror as too glaringly simple and direct a source of facts to suit the
                  needs of a professed romance. Be there left, he would say, some room for fancy,
                  and even for conjecture. Let the author seem occasionally to consult with his
                  companion, gracefully to defer to his judgment. Bare statement, the parade of
                  indisputable evidence, is well enough in law, but appears ungentle in a work of
                  fiction.</p>
               <p>How just is this mild censure! how gladly are its demands conceded! Let dogmatism
                  retire, and blossom, flowers of fancy, on your yielding stems! Henceforward the
                  reader is our confidential counsellor. We will pretend that our means of
                  information are no better than other writers'. We will uniformly revel in
                  speculation, and dally with imaginative delights; and only when hard pressed for
                  the true path will we snatch off the veil, and let forth for a moment a redeeming
                  ray.</p>
               <p>In this generous mood, we pass through the partition between No. 27 and No. 29. In
                  the matter of bedchambers—even hotel bedchambers—there can be great diversity.
                  That we were in just now was close and unwholesome, and wore an air of
                  feverishness and disorder. Here, on the contrary, the air is fresh and brisk, for
                  the breeze from Boston harbor—slightly flavored, it is true, by its journey across
                  the northern part of the city—has been blowing into the room all night long. Here
                  are some trunks and carpetbags, well bepasted with the names of foreign towns and
                  countries, famous and infamous. One of the trunks is a bathing-tub, fitted with a
                  cover,—an agreeable promise of refreshment amidst the dust and weariness of
                  travel. A Russia-leather travelling-bag lies open on the table, disgorging an
                  abundant armament of brushes and combs and various toilet niceties. Mr. Helwyse
                  must be a dandy.</p>
               <p>Cheek by jowl with the haversack lies a cylindrical case of the same kind of
                  leather, with a strap attached, to<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6660-00000018"/> sling
                  over the shoulder. This, perhaps, contains a telescope. It would not be worth
                  mentioning, save that our prophetic vision sees it coming into use by and by. Not
                  to analyze too closely, everything in this room speaks of life, health, and
                  movement. In spite of smallness, bareness, and angularity, it is fit for a May
                  morning to enter, and expand to full-grown day.</p>
               <p>It is now about half past four, and the crisp new sunshine, just above ground, has
                  clambered over the window-sill, taken a flying leap across the narrow floor, and
                  is chuckling full in the agreeable face asleep upon the pillow. The face, feeling
                  the warmth, and conscious, through its closed eyelids, of the light, presently
                  stretches its eyebrows, then blinks, and finally yawns,—Ah—h! Thirty-two even,
                  white teeth, in perfect order; a great, red, healthy tongue, and a round, mellow
                  roar, the parting remonstrance of the sleepy god, taking flight for the day.
                  Thereupon a voice, fetched from some profounder source than the back of the
                  head,—</p>
               <p>"Steward! bring me my—Oh! A land-lubber again, am I!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Balder Helwyse now sits up in bed, his hair and beard,—which are
                  extraordinarily luxuriant, and will be treated at greater length hereafter,—his
                  hair and beard in the wildest confusion. He stares about him with a pair of
                  well-opened dark eyes, which contrast trast strangely with his fair Northern
                  complexion. Next comes a spasmodic stretching of arms and legs, a whisking of
                  bedclothes, and a solid thump of two feet upon the floor. Another survey of the
                  room, ending with a deep breathing in of the fresh air and an appreciative smack
                  of the lips.</p>
               <p>"O nose, eyes, ears, and all my other godlike senses and faculties! what a
                  sensation is this of Mother Earth at sunrise! Better, seems to me, than ocean,
                  beloved of my Scandinavian forefathers. Hear those birds! look at those divine
                  trees, and the tall moist grass round them! By my head! living is a glorious
                  business!—What, ho! slave, empty me here that bath-tub, and then ring the
                  bell."</p>
               <p>The slave—a handsome, handy fellow, unusually docile, inseparable from his master,
                  whose life-long bondsman he was, and so much like him in many ways (owing,
                  perhaps, to the intimacy always subsisting between the two), that he had more than
                  once been confounded with him,—this obedient menial—</p>
               <p>No! not even for a moment will we mislead our reader. Are we not sworn confidants?
                  What is he to think, then, of this abrupt introduction, unheralded, unexplained?
                  Be it at once confessed that Mr. Helwyse travelled unattended, that there was no
                  slave or other person of any kind in the room, and that this high-sounding order
                  of his was a mere ebullition of his peculiar humor.</p>
               <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6660-00000019"/>
               <p>He was a philosopher, and was in the habit of making many of his tenets minister
                  to his amusement, when in his more sportive and genial moods. Not to exhaust his
                  characteristics too early in the story, it need only be observed here that he held
                  body and soul distinct, and so far antagonistic that one or the other must be
                  master; furthermore, that the soul's supremacy was the more desirable. Whether it
                  were also invariable and uncontested, there will be opportunity to find out later.
                  Meantime, this dual condition was productive of not a little harmless
                  entertainment to Mr. Helwyse, at times when persons less happily organized would
                  become victims of ennui. Be the conditions what they might, he was never without a
                  companion, whose ways he knew, and whom he was yet never weary of questioning and
                  studying. No subject so dull that its different aspects, as viewed from soul and
                  from body, would not give it piquancy. No question so trivial that its discussion
                  on material and on spiritual grounds would not lend it importance. Nor was any
                  enjoyment so keen as not to be enhanced by the contrast of its physical with its
                  psychical phase.</p>
               <p>Waking up, therefore, on this May morning, and being in a charming humor, he chose
                  to look upon himself as the proprietor of a body-servant, and to give his orders
                  with patrician imperiousness. The obedient menial, then,—to resume the
                  thread,—sprang upon the tub-trunk, whipped off the lid, and discharged the
                  contents upon the bed in a twinkling. This done, he stepped to the bell-rope, and
                  lent it a vigorous jerk, soon answered by a brisk tapping at the door.</p>
               <p>"Please, sir, did you ring?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I did, my dear. Are you the pretty chambermaid?"</p>
               <p>This bold venture is met by silence, only modified by a low delighted giggle.
                  Presently,—"Did you want anything, sir, please?"</p>
               <p>"Ever so many things, my girl; more than my life is long enough to tell! First,
                  though, I want to apologize for addressing you from behind a closed door; but
                  circumstances which I can neither explain nor overcome forbid my opening it. Next,
                  two pails of the best cold water at your earliest convenience. Hurry, now, there's
                  a Hebe!"</p>
               <p>"Very good, sir," giggles Hebe, retreating down the passage.</p>
               <p>It is to be supposed that it was the plebeian body-servant that carried on this
                  unideal conversation, and that the patrician soul had nothing to do with it. The
                  ability to lay the burden of lapses from good taste, and other goods, upon the
                  shoulders of the flesh, is sometimes convenient and comforting.</p>
               <p>Balder Helwyse, master and man, turns away from the door, and catches sight of a
                  white-robed, hairy-headed<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6660-00000020"/> headed
                  reflection in the looking-glass, the phantom face of which at once expands in a
                  genial expression of mirth; an impalpable arm is outstretched, and the mouth seems
                  thus to speak:—</p>
               <p>"Stick to your bath, my good fellow, and the evil things of this life shall not
                  get hold of you. Water is like truth,—purifying, transparent; a tonic to those
                  fouled and wearied with the dust and vanity of this transitional phenomenon called
                  the world. Patronize it! be thy acquaintance with it constant and familiar!
                  Remember, my dear Balder, that this slave of thine is the medium through which
                  something better than he (thyself, namely) is filtered to the world, and the world
                  to thee. Go to, then! if the filter be foul, shall not that which is filtered
                  become unclean also?"</p>
               <p>Here the rhetorical phantom was interrupted by the sound of a very good violin,
                  touched with unusual skill, in the next room. The phantom vanished, but Mr.
                  Helwyse seated himself softly upon the bed, listening with full enjoyment to every
                  note; his very toes seeming to partake of his appreciation. Music is the
                  mysterious power which makes body and soul—master and man—thrill as one string.
                  The musician played several bars, beautiful in themselves, but unconnected; and
                  ever and anon there sounded a discordant note, like a smirch upon a fair picture.
                  The execution, however, showed a master hand, and the themes betrayed the soul of
                  a true musician, albeit tainted with some subtile deformity.</p>
               <p>"Heard him last night, and fell asleep, dreaming of a man with the brain of a
                  devil and an angel's heart. Drop in on him presently, and have him down to
                  breakfast. If young, shall be our brother,—so long as there's anything in him.
                  If—as I partly suspect—old, and a father, marry his daughter. But no; such a
                  fiddler as he can't be married, unless unhappily." Mr. Helwyse runs his hands
                  dreamily through his tangled mane, and shakes it back. If philosophical, he seems
                  also to be romantic and imaginative, and impressionable by other personalities. It
                  is, to be sure, unfair to judge a man from such unconsidered words as he may let
                  fall during the first half-hour after waking up in the morning; were it otherwise,
                  we should infer that, although he might take a genuine interest in whomever he
                  meets, it would be too analytical to last long, except where the vein was a very
                  rich one. He would pick the kernel out of the nut, but that done, would feel no
                  sentimental interest in the shell. Too much of this! and yet who can help drawing
                  conclusions (and not always incorrectly) from the first sight and sound of a new
                  acquaintance?</p>
               <p>There is a knock at the door, and Mr. Helwyse calls out, "Hullo? Ah! the cold
                  water, emblem of truth. Thank you, Hebe; and scamper away as fast as you can, for
                  I'm going to open the door!"</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6660-00000021"/>
               <p>We also will retire, fastidious reader, and employ the leisure interval in packing
                  an imaginary carpet-bag for a short journey. Our main business, during the next
                  few days, is with Mr. Helwyse, and since there will be no telling what becomes of
                  him after that, he must be followed up pretty closely. A few days does not seem
                  much for the getting a satisfactory knowledge of a man; nevertheless, an hour,
                  rightly used, may be ample. If he will continue his habit of thinking aloud, will
                  affect situations tending to bring out his leading traits of character; if we may
                  intrude upon him, note-book in hand, in all his moods and crises,—with all this in
                  addition to discretionary use of the magic mirror,—it will be our own fault if Mr.
                  Helwyse be not turned inside out. Properly speaking, there is no mystery about
                  men, but only a great dulness and lethargy in our perceptions of them. The secret
                  of the universe is no more a secret than is the answer to a school-boy's problem.
                  A mathematician will draw you a triangle and a circle, and show you the
                  trigonometrical science latent therein. But a profounder mathematician would do as
                  much with the equation man!</p>
               <p>While Mr. Helwyse is still lingering over his toilet, his neighbor the fiddler,
                  whom he had meant to ask to breakfast, comes out of his room, violin-box in hand,
                  walks along the passage-way, and is off down stairs. An odd-looking figure; those
                  stylish clothes become him as little as they would a long-limbed, angular Egyptian
                  statue. Fashion, in some men, is an eccentricity, or rather a violence done to
                  their essential selves. A born fop would have looked as little at home in a toga
                  and sandals, as did this swarthy musician, doctor, priest, or whatever he was, in
                  his fashion-plate costume. Then why did he wear it?</p>
               <p>There are other things to be followed up before attending to that question. But
                  the man is gone, and Balder Helwyse has missed this opportunity of making his
                  acquaintance. Had he been an hour earlier,—had any one of us, for that matter,
                  ever been an hour earlier or later,—who can tell how the destinies of the world
                  would be affected! Luckily for our peace of mind, the hypothesis involves an
                  impossibility.</p>

               <head type="sub">A BRAHMAN.</head>
               <p>WHOEVER has been in Boston remembers, or has seen, the old Beacon Hill Bank, which
                  stood, not on Beacon Hill, indeed, but in that part of School Street now occupied
                  by the City Hall. You passed down by the dirty old church, on the northeast corner
                  of School and Tremont Streets, which stands trying to hide its ugly face behind a
                  row of columns like sooty fingers, and whose School-Street side is quite bare, and
                  has the distracted aspect peculiar to buildings erected on an inclined
                  plane;—passing this, you came in sight of the bank, a darksome, respectable
                  edifice of brick, two stories and a half high, and gambrel-roofed. It stood a
                  little back from the street, much as an antiquated aristocrat might withdraw from
                  the stream of modern life, and fancy himself exclusive. The poor old bank! Its
                  respectable brick walls have contributed a few rubbish-heaps to the new land in
                  the Back Bay, perhaps; and its floors and gambrel-roof have long since vanished up
                  somebody's chimney; only its money—its baser parts—still survives vives and
                  circulates. Aristocracy and exclusivism do not pay.</p>
               <p>The bank, perhaps, took its title from the fact that it owed its chief support to
                  the Beacon Hill families,—Boston's aristocracy; and Boston's standard names
                  appeared upon its list of managers. If business led you that way, you mounted the
                  well-worn steps, and entered the rather strict and formal door, over which clung
                  the weather-worn sign,—faded gold lettering upon a rusty black background. Nothing
                  that met your eyes looked new, although everything was scrupulously neat. Opposite
                  the doorway, a wooden flight of stairs mounted to the next floor, where were the
                  offices of some old Puritan lawyers. Leaving the stairs on your left, you passed
                  down a dusky passage, and through a glass door, when behold! the banking-room,
                  with its four grave bald-headed clerks. But you did not come to draw or deposit,
                  your business was with the President. "Mr. MacGentle in?" "That way, sir." You
                  opened a door with "Private" painted in black letters upon its ground-glass panel.
                  Another bald-headed gentleman, with a grim determination about the mouth, rose up
                  from his table and barred your way. This was Mr. Dyke, the breakwater against
                  which the waves of would-be intruders into the inner seclusion often broke
                  themselves in vain; and unless you had a genuine pass, your expedition ended
                  there.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6660-00000023"/>
               <p>Our pass—for we, too, are to call on Mr. MacGentle—would carry us through solider
                  obstructions than Mr. Dyke; it is the pass of imagination. He does not even raise
                  his head as we brush by him.</p>
               <p>But, first, let us inquire who Mr. MacGentle is, besides President of the Beacon
                  Hill Bank. He is a man of refinement and cultivation, a scholar and a reader, has
                  travelled, and, it is said, could handle a pen to better purpose than the signing
                  bank-notes. In his earlier years he studied law, and gained a certain degree of
                  distinction in the profession, although (owing, perhaps, to his having entered it
                  with too ideal and high-strung views as to its nature and scope) he never met with
                  what is vulgarly called success. Fortunately for the ideal barrister, an ample
                  private estate made him independent of professional earnings. Later in life, he
                  trod the confines of politics, still, however, enveloping himself in that
                  theoretical, unpractical atmosphere which was his most marked, and, to some
                  people, least comprehensible characteristic. A certain mild halo of statesmanship
                  ever after invested him; not that he had at any time actually borne a share in the
                  government of the nation, but it was understood that he might have done so, had he
                  so chosen, or had his political principles been tough and elastic enough to endure
                  the wear and strain of action. As it was, some of the most renowned men in the
                  Senate were known to have been his intimates at college, and he still met and
                  conversed with them on terms of equality.</p>
               <p>Between law, literature, and statesmanship, in all of which pursuits he had
                  acquired respect and goodwill, without actually accomplishing anything, Mr.
                  MacGentle fell, no one knew exactly how, into the presidential chair of the Beacon
                  Hill Bank. As soon as he was there, everybody saw that there he belonged. His
                  social position, his culture, his honorable, albeit intangible record, suited the
                  old bank well. He had an air of subdued wisdom, and people were fond of appealing
                  to his judgment and asking his advice,—perhaps because he never seemed to expect
                  them to follow it when given (as, indeed, they never did). The Board of Directors
                  looked up to him, deferred to him,—nay, believed him to be as necessary to the
                  bank's existence as the entire aggregate of its supporters; but neither the Board
                  nor the President himself ever dreamed of adopting Mr. MacGentle's financial
                  theories in the conduct of the banking business.</p>
               <p>Let no one hastily infer that the accomplished gentleman of whom we speak was in
                  any sense a sham. No one could be more true to himself and his professions. But—if
                  we may hazard a conjecture—he never breathed the air that other men breathe;
                  another sun than ours shone for him; the world that<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000024"/> met his senses was not our world. His life, in
                  short, was not human life, yet so closely like it that the two might be said to
                  correspond, as a face to its reflection in the mirror; actual contact being in
                  both cases impossible. No doubt the world and he knew of the barrier between them,
                  though neither said so. The former, with its usual happy temperament, was little
                  affected by the separation, smiled good-naturedly upon the latter, and never
                  troubled itself about the difficulties in the way of shaking hands. But Mr.
                  MacGentle, being only a single man, perhaps felt lonely and sad. Either he was a
                  ghost, or the world was. In youth, he may have believed himself to be the only
                  real flesh and blood; but in later years, the terrible weight of the world's
                  majority forced him to the opposite conclusion. And here, at last, he and the
                  world were at one!</p>
               <p>Suppose, instead of listening to a personal description of this good old
                  gentleman, we take a look at him with our own eyes. There is no danger of
                  disturbing him, no matter how busy he may be. The inner retreat is very small, and
                  as neat as though an old maid lived in it. The furniture looks as good as new, but
                  is subdued to a tone of sober maturity, and chimes in so well with the general
                  effect that one scarcely notices it. The polished table is mounted in dark
                  morocco; behind the horsehair-covered arm-chair is a gray marble mantel-piece,
                  overshadowing an open grate with polished bars and fire-utensils in the English
                  style. During the winter months a lump of cannel-coal is always burning there; but
                  the flame, even on the coldest days, is too much on its good behavior to give out
                  very decided heat. Over the mantel-piece hangs a crayon copy of Correggio's
                  Reading Magdalen,—the only touch of sentiment in the whole room, and that,
                  perhaps, accidental.</p>
               <p>The concrete nature of the President's surroundings is at first perplexing, in
                  view of our theory about his character. But it is evident that the world could
                  never provide him with furniture corresponding to the texture of his mind; and
                  hence he would instinctively lay hold of that which was most commonplace and
                  non-committal. If he could realize nothing outside himself, he might at least
                  remove whatever would distract him from inward contemplation. There is, how-ever,
                  one article in this little room which we must not omit to notice. It is a
                  looking-glass; and it hangs, of all places in the world, right over Mr.
                  MacGentle's standing-desk, in the embrasure of the window. As often as he looks up
                  he beholds the reflection of his cultured and sad-lined physiognomy, with a
                  glimpse of dusky wall beyond. Is he a vain man? His worst enemy, had he one, would
                  not call him that. Nevertheless, Mr. MacGentle finds a pathetic comfort in this<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6660-00000025"/> small mirror. No one, not even he, could
                  tell wherefore; but we fancy it to be like that an exile feels, seeing a picture
                  of his birthplace, or hearing a strain of his native music. The mirror shows him
                  something more real, to his sense, than is anything outside of it!</p>
               <p>Well, there stands the old gentleman, writing at this desk in the window. All men,
                  they say, bear more or less resemblance to some animal; Mr. MacGentle, rather tall
                  and slender, with his slight stoop, and his black broadcloth frock-coat buttoned
                  closely about his waist, brings to mind a cultivated, grandfatherly greyhound,
                  upon his hind legs. He has thick white hair, with a gentle curl in it, growing all
                  over his finely moulded head. He is close-shaven; his mouth and nose are formed
                  with great delicacy; his eyes, now somewhat faded, yet show an occasional
                  reminiscence of youthful fire. The eyebrows are habitually lifted,—a result,
                  possibly, of the growing infirmity of Mr. MacGentle's vision; but it produces an
                  expression of half-plaintive resignation, which is rendered pathetic by the
                  wrinkles across his forehead and the dejected lines about his delicate mouth.</p>
               <p>He is dressed with faultless nicety and elegance, though in a fashion now out of
                  date. Perhaps, in graceful recognition of the advance of age, he has adhered to
                  the style in vogue when age first began to weigh upon his shoulders. He gazes
                  mildly out from the embrasure of an upright collar and tall stock; below spreads a
                  wide expanse of spotless shirt-front. His trousers are always gray, except in the
                  heat of summer, when they become snowy white. They are uniformly too long; yet he
                  never dispenses with his straps, nor with the gaiters that crown his gentlemanly
                  shoes.</p>
               <p>Although not a stimulating companion, one loves to be where Amos MacGentle is; to
                  watch his quiet movements, and listen to his meditative talk. What he says
                  generally bears the stamp of thought and intellectual capacity, and at first
                  strikes the listener as rare good sense; yet, if reconsidered afterwards, or
                  applied to the practical tests of life, his wisdom is apt to fall mysteriously
                  short. Is Mr. MacGentle aware of this curious fact? There sometimes is a sadly
                  humorous curving of the lips and glimmering in the eyes after he has uttered
                  something especially profound, which almost warrants the suspicion. The lack of
                  accord between the old gentleman and the world has become to him, at last, a
                  dreary sort of jest.</p>
               <p>But we might go on forever touching the elusive chords of Mr. MacGentle's being;
                  one cannot help loving him, or, if he be not real enough to love, bestowing upon
                  him such affection as is inspired by some gentle symphony. Unfortunately, he
                  figures but little in the coming pages, and in no active part; such,<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000026"/> indeed, were unsuited to him. But it is pleasant to
                  pass through his retired little office on our way to scenes less peaceful and
                  subdued; and we would gladly look forward to seeing him once more, when the heat
                  of the day is over and the sun has gone down.</p>

               <head type="sub">A NEW MAN WITH AN OLD FACE.</head>
               <p>ABOUT an hour before noon on this same twenty-seventh of May, Mr. Dyke heard a
                  voice in the outer room. He had held his position in the house as confidential
                  clerk for nearly or quite twenty-five years, was blessed with a good memory, and
                  was fond of saying that he never forgot a face or a voice. So, as this voice from
                  the outer room reached his ears, he turned one eye up towards the door and
                  muttered, "Heard that before, somewhere!"</p>
               <p>The ground-glass panel darkened, and the door was thrown wide open. Upon the
                  threshold stood a young man about six feet in height, of figure rather graceful
                  and harmonious than massive. A black velveteen jacket fitted closely to his shape;
                  he had on a Tyrolese hat; his boots, of thin, pliant leather, reached above the
                  knee. He carried a stout cane, with a handle of chamois-horn; to a couple of
                  straps, crossing each shoulder, were attached a travelling-scrip and a
                  telescope-case.</p>
               <p>But neither his attire nor the unusual size and dark<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000027"/> brilliancy of his eyes was so noticeable as his
                  hair and beard, which outgrew the bounds of common experience. Beards, to be sure,
                  were far more rare twenty years ago than they have since become. The hair was
                  yellow, with the true hyacinthine curl pervading it. Rejoicing in luxuriant might,
                  it clothed and reclothed the head, and, descending lower, tumbled itself in bold
                  masses on the young man's shoulders. As for the beard, it was well in keeping. Of
                  a purer yellow than the hair, it twisted down in crisp, vigorous waves below the
                  point marked by mankind's third shirt-stud. It was full half as broad as it was
                  long, and lay to the right and left from the centre-line of the face. The owner of
                  this oriflamme looked like a young Scandinavian god.</p>
               <p>There seems to be a deeper significance in hair than meets the eye. Sons of Esau,
                  whose beards grow high up on their cheek-bones, who are hairy down to their
                  ankles, and to the second joints of their fingers, are generally men of a kindly
                  and charitable nature, strong in what we call the human element. One remembers
                  their stout hand-grip; they look frankly in one's face, and the heart is apt to go
                  out to them more spontaneously than to the smooth-faced Jacobs. Such a man was
                  Samson, whose hair was his strength,—the strength of inborn truth and goodness,
                  whereby he was enabled to smite the lying Philistines. And although though they
                  once, by their sophistries, managed to get the better of him for a while, they
                  forgot that good inborn is too vigorous a matter for any mere razor finally to
                  subdue. See, again, what a great beard Saint Paul had, and what an outspoken,
                  vigorous heart! Was it from freak that Greeks and Easterns reverenced beards as
                  symbols of manhood, dignity, and wisdom? or that Christian Fathers thundered
                  against the barber, as a violator of divine law? No one, surely, could accuse that
                  handy, oily, easy little personage of evil intent; but he symbolized the subtile
                  principle which pares away the natural virtue of man, and substitutes an
                  artificial polish, which is hypocrisy. It is to be observed, however, that hair
                  can be representative of natural evil as well as of good. A tangle-headed
                  bush-ranger does not win our sympathies. A Mussulman keeps his beard religiously
                  clean.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the yellow-haired Scandinavian, whom we have already laid under the
                  imputation of being a dandy, stood on the threshold of Mr. Dyke's office, and that
                  gentleman confronted him with a singularly inquisitive stare. The visitor's face
                  was a striking one, but can be described, for the present, only in general terms.
                  He might not be called handsome; yet a very handsome man would be apt to appear
                  insignificant beside him. His features showed strength, and were at the same time
                  cleanly and finely cut. There was<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6660-00000028"/> freedom
                  in the arch of his eyebrows, and plenty of eye-room beneath them.</p>
               <p>He took off his hat to Mr. Dyke, and smiled at him with artless superiority,
                  insomuch that the elderly clerk's sixty years were disconcerted, and the Cerberus
                  seemed to dwindle into the bumpkin! This young fellow, a good deal less than half
                  Mr. Dyke's age, was yet a far older man of the world than he. Not that his
                  appearance suggested the kind of maturity which results from abnormal or distorted
                  development,— on the contrary, he was thoroughly genial and healthful. But that
                  power and assurance of eye and lip, generally bought only at the price of many
                  years' buffetings, given and taken, were here married to the first flush and vigor
                  of young manhood.</p>
               <p>"My name is Helwyse; I have come from Europe to see Mr. Amos MacGentle," said the
                  visitor, courteously.</p>
               <p>"Helwyse!—Hel—" repeated Mr. Dyke, having seemingly quite forgotten himself. His
                  customary manner to strangers implied that he knew, better than they did, who they
                  were and what they wanted; and that what he knew was not much to their credit. But
                  he could only open his mouth and stare at this Helwyse.</p>
               <p>"Mr. MacGentle is an old friend; run in and tell him I'm here, and you will see."
                  The young man put his hand kindly on the elderly clerk's shoulder, much as though
                  the latter were a gaping school-boy, and directed him gently towards the inner
                  door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dyke regained his voice by an effort, though still lacking complete
                  self-command. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Helwyse, sir,—of course, of course,—it
                  didn't seem possible,—so long, you know,—but I remembered the voice and the face
                  and the name,—I never forget,—but, by George, sir, can you really be—?"</p>
               <p>"I see you have a good memory; you are Dyke, aren't you?" And Mr. Helwyse threw
                  back his head and laughed, perhaps at the clerk's bewildered face. At all events,
                  the latter laughed, too, and they both shook hands very heartily.</p>
               <p>"Beg pardon again, Mr. Helwyse, I'll speak to the President," said Mr. Dyke, and
                  stepped into the sanctuary of sanctuaries.</p>
               <p>Mr. MacGentle was taking a nap. He was seventy years old, and could drop asleep
                  easily. When he slept, however lightly and briefly, he was pretty sure to dream;
                  and if awakened suddenly, his dream would often prolong itself, and mingle with
                  passing events, which would themselves put on the semblance of unreality. On the
                  present occasion the sound of Helwyse's voice had probably crept through the door,
                  and insinuated itself into his dreaming brain.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6660-00000029"/>
               <p>Mr. Dyke was too much excited to remark the President's condition. He put his
                  mouth close to the old gentleman's ear, and said, in an emphatic and penetrating
                  undertone,—</p>
               <p>"Here's your old friend Helwyse, who died in Europe two years ago, come back
                  again, <emph>younger than ever!</emph>"</p>
               <p>If the confidential clerk expected his superior to echo his own bewilderment, he
                  was disappointed. Mr. MacGentle unclosed his eyes, looked up, and answered rather
                  pettishly,—</p>
               <p>"What nonsense are you talking about his dying in Europe, Mr. Dyke? He has n't
                  been in Europe for six years. I was expecting him. Let him come in at once."</p>
               <p>But he was already there; and Mr. Dyke slipped out again with consternation
                  written upon his features. Mr. MacGentle found himself with his thin old hand in
                  the young man's warm grasp.</p>
               <p>"Helwyse, how do you do?—how do you do? Ah! you look as well as ever. I was just
                  thinking about you. Sit down,— sit down!"</p>
               <p>The old President's voice had a strain of melancholy in it, partly the result of
                  chronic asthma, and partly, no doubt, of a melancholic temperament. This strain,
                  being constant, sometimes had a curiously incongruous effect as contrasted with
                  the subject or circumstances in hand. Whether hailing the dawn of the millennium,
                  holding playful converse with a child, making a speech before the Board,—under
                  whatever rhetorical conditions, Mr. MacGentle's intonation was always pitched in
                  the same murmurous and somewhat plaintive key. Moreover, a corresponding
                  immobility of facial expression had grown upon him; so that altogether, though he
                  was the most sympathetic and sensitive of men, a superficial observer might take
                  him to be lacking in the common feelings and impulses of humanity.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the incongruity alluded to had not altogether escaped his own notice, and
                  since discord of any kind pained him, he had mended the matter—as best he could—by
                  surrendering himself entirely to his mournful voice; allowing it to master his
                  gestures, choice of language, almost his thoughts. The result was a colorlessness
                  of manner which did great injustice to the gentle and delicate soul behind.</p>
               <p>This conjecture might explain why Mr. MacGentle, instead of falling upon his
                  friend's neck and shedding tears of welcome there, only uttered a few common-place
                  sentences, and then drooped back into his chair. But it throws no light upon his
                  remark that he had been expecting the arrival of a friend who, it would appear,
                  had been dead two years. Helwyse himself may have been puzzled by this; or, being
                  a quick-witted young man, he may have divined its explanation. He looked at his
                  entertainer with critical sympathy not untinged with humor.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6660-00000030"/>
               <p>"I hope you are as well as I am," said he.</p>
               <p>"A little tired this morning, I believe; I never was so strong a man as you,
                  Helwyse. I think I must have passed a bad night. I remember dreaming I was an old
                  man,—an old man with white hair, Helwyse."</p>
               <p>"Were you glad to wake up again?" asked the young man, meeting the elder's faded
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know whether I'm quite awake yet. And, after all, Thor, I'm not sure
                  that I don't wish the dream might have been true. If I were really an old man,
                  what a long, lonely future I should escape! but as it is—as it is—"</p>
               <p>He relapsed into reverie. Ah! Mr. MacGentle, are you again the tall and graceful
                  youth, full of romance and fire, who roamed abroad in quest of adventures with
                  your trusty friend Thor Helwyse, the yellow-bearded Scandinavian? Do you fancy
                  this fresh, unwrinkled face a mate to your own? and is it but the vision of a
                  restless night,—this long-drawn life of dull routine and gradual disappointment
                  and decay? Open those dim eyes of yours, good sir! stir those thin old legs!
                  inflate that sunken chest!— Ha! is that cough imaginary? those trembling
                  muscles,—are they a delusion? is that misty glance only a momentary weakness?
                  There is no youth left in you, Mr. MacGentle; not so much as would keep a rose in
                  bloom for an hour.</p>
               <p>"Have you seen Doctor Glyphic lately?" inquired Helwyse, after a pause.</p>
               <p>"Glyphic?—do you know, I was thinking of him just now,—of our first meeting with
                  him in the African desert. You remember!—a couple of Bedouins were carrying him
                  off,—they had captured him on his way to some apocryphal ruin among the
                  sand-heaps. What a grand moment was that when you caught the Sheik round the
                  throat with your umbrella-handle, and pulled him off his horse! and then we
                  mounted poor Glyphic upon it,—mummied cat and all,—and away over the hot sand!
                  What a day was that! what a day was that!"</p>
               <p>The speaker's eyes had kindled; for a moment one saw the far flat desert, the
                  struggling knot of men and horses, the stampede of the three across the plain, and
                  the high sun flaming inextinguishable laughter over all!—and it had happened nigh
                  forty years ago.</p>
               <p>"He never forgot that service," resumed Mr. MacGentle, his customary plaintive
                  manner returning. "To that, and to your saving the Egyptian lad,—Manetho,—you owe
                  your wife Helen: ah! forgive me,—I had forgotten; she is dead,—she is dead."</p>
               <p>"I never could understand," remarked Helwyse, aiming to lead the conversation away
                  from gloomy topics, "why the Doctor made so much of Manetho."</p>
               <p>"That was only a part of the Egyptian mania that<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000031"/> possessed him, and began, you know, with his
                  changing his name from Henry to Hiero; and has gone on, until now, I suppose, he
                  actually believes himself to be some old inscription, containing precious secrets,
                  not to be found elsewhere. Before the adventure with the boy, I remember, he had
                  formed the idea of building a miniature Egypt in New Jersey; and Manetho served
                  well as the living human element in it. 'Though I take him to America,' you know
                  he said, 'he shall live in Egypt still. He shall have a temple, and an altar, and
                  Isis and Osiris, and papyri and palm-trees and a crocodile; and when he dies I
                  will embalm him like a Pharaoh.' 'But suppose you die first?' said one of us.
                  'Then he shall embalm me!' cried Hiero, and I will be the first American
                  mummy.'"</p>
               <p>Mr. MacGentle seemed to find a dreamy enjoyment in working this vein of
                  reminiscence. He sat back in his low arm-chair, his unsubstantial face turned
                  meditatively towards the Magdalen, his hands brought together to support his
                  delicate chin. Helwyse, apprehending that the vein might at last bring the dreamer
                  down to the present day, encouraged him to follow it.</p>
               <p>"It must have been a disappointment to the Doctor that his protégé took up the
                  Christian religion, instead of following the faith and observances of his Egyptian
                  ancestors, for the last five thousand years!"</p>
               <p>"Why, perhaps it was, Thor, perhaps it was," murmured mured Mr. MacGentle. "But
                  Manetho never entered the pulpit, you know; it would not have been to his interest
                  to do so; besides that, I believe he is really devoted to Glyphic, believing that
                  it was he who saved him from the crocodile. People are all the time making such
                  absurd mistakes. Manetho is a man who would be unalterable either in gratitude or
                  enmity, although his external manner is so mild. And as to his taking orders, why,
                  as long as he wore an Egyptian robe, and said his prayers in an Egyptian temple,
                  it would be all the same to Glyphic what religion the man professed!"</p>
               <p>"Doctor Glyphic is still alive, then?"</p>
               <p>The old man looked at the young one with an air half apprehensive, half perplexed,
                  as if scenting the far approach of some undefined difficulty. He passed his white
                  hand over his forehead. "Everything seems out of joint to-day, Helwyse. Nothing
                  looks or seems natural, except you! What is the matter with me?—what is the matter
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>Helwyse sat with both hands twisted in his mighty beard, and one booted leg thrown
                  over the other. He was full of sympathy at the spectacle of poor Amos MacGentle,
                  blindly groping after the phantom of a flower whose bloom and fragrance had
                  vanished so terribly long ago; and yet, for some reason or other, he could hardly
                  forbear a smile. When anything is<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6660-00000032"/> utterly
                  out of place, it is no more pathetic than absurd; moreover, young men are always
                  secretly inclined to laugh at old ones!</p>
               <p>"Why should not Glyphic be alive?" resumed Mr. MacGentle. "Why not he, as well as
                  you or I? Aren't we all about of an age?"</p>
               <p>Helwyse drew his chair close to his companion's, and took his hand, as if it had
                  been a young girl's. "My dear friend," said he, "you said you felt tired this
                  morning, but you forget how far you've travelled since we last met. Doctor
                  Glyphic, if he be living now, must be more than sixty years old. Your dream of old
                  age was such as many have dreamed before, and not awakened from in this
                  world!"</p>
               <p>"Let me think!—let me think!" said the old man; and, Helwyse drawing back, there
                  ensued a silence, varied only by a long and tremulous sigh from his companion;
                  whether of relief or dejection, the visitor could not decide. But when Mr.
                  MacGentle spoke, it was with more assurance. Either from mortification at his
                  illusion, or more probably from imperfect perception of it, he made no reference
                  to what had passed. Old age possesses a kind of composure, arising from dulled
                  sensibilities, which the most self-possessed youth can never rival.</p>
               <p>"We heard, through the London branch of our house, that Thor Helwyse died some two
                  years ago."</p>
               <p>"He was drowned in the Baltic Sea. I am his son Balder."</p>
               <p>"He was my friend," observed the old man, simply; but the tone he used was a
                  magnet to attract the son's heart. "You look very much like him, only his eyes
                  were blue, and yours, as I now see, are dark; but you might be mistaken for
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I sometimes have been," rejoined Balder, with a half-smile.</p>
               <p>"And you are his son! You are most welcome!" said Mr. MacGentle, with
                  old-fashioned courtesy. "Forgive me if I have—if anything has occurred to annoy
                  you. I am a very old man, Mr. Balder; so old that sometimes I believe I forget how
                  old I am! And Thor is dead,—drowned,—you say?"</p>
               <p>"The Baltic, you know, has been the grave of many of our forefathers; I think my
                  father was glad to follow them. I never saw him in better spirits than during that
                  gale. We were bound to England from Denmark."</p>
               <p>"Helen's death saddened him,—I know,—I know; he was never gay after that. But
                  how—how did—?"</p>
               <p>"He would keep the deck, though the helmsman had to be lashed to the wheel. I
                  think he never cared to see land again, but he was full of spirits and life. He
                  said this was weather fit for a Viking.</p>
               <p>"We were standing by the foremast, holding on by a<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000033"/> belaying-pin. The sea came over the side, and
                  struck him overboard. I went after him. Another wave brought me back; but not my
                  father! I was knocked senseless, and when I came to, it was too late."</p>
               <p>Helwyse's voice, towards the end of this story, became husky, and Mr. MacGentle's
                  eyes, as he listened, grew dimmer than ever.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said he, "I shall not die so. I shall die away gradually, like a breeze that
                  has been blowing this way and that all day, and falls at sunset, no one knows how.
                  Thor died as became him; and I shall die as becomes me,—as becomes me!" And so,
                  indeed, he did, a few years later; but not unknown nor uncared for.</p>
               <p>Balder Helwyse was a philosopher, no doubt; but it was no part of his wisdom to be
                  indifferent to unstrained sympathy. He went on to speak further of his own
                  concerns,—a thing he was little used to do.</p>
               <p>It appeared that, from the time he first crossed the Atlantic, being then about
                  four years old, up to the time he had recrossed it, a few weeks ago, he had been
                  journeying to and fro over the Eastern Hemisphere. His father, who, as well as
                  himself, was American by birth, was the descendant of a Danish family of high
                  station and antiquity, and inherited the restless spirit of his ancestors. In the
                  course of his early wanderings he had fallen in with MacGentle, who, though
                  somewhat older than Helwyse, was still a young man; and later these two had
                  encountered Hiero Glyphic. About fifteen years after this it was that Thor
                  appeared at Glyphic's house in New Jersey, and was welcomed by that singular man
                  as a brother; and here he fell in love with Glyphic's sister Helen, and married
                  her. With her he received a large fortune, which the addition of his own made
                  great; and at Glyphic's death, Thor or his heirs would inherit the bulk of the
                  estate left by him.</p>
               <p>So Thor, being then in the first prime of life, was prepared to settle down and
                  become domestic. But the sudden death of his wife, and the subsequent loss of one
                  of the children she had borne him, drove him once more abroad, with his baby son,
                  never again to take root, or to return. And here Balder's story, as told by him,
                  began. He seemed to have matured very early, and to have taken hold of knowledge
                  in all its branches like a Titan. The precise age at which he had learned all that
                  European schools could teach him, it is not necessary to specify; since it is
                  rather with the nature of his mind than with the list of his accomplishments that
                  we shall have to do. It might be possible, by tracing his connection with French,
                  or German, or English philosophers, to make shrewd guesses at the qualities of his
                  own creed; but these will perhaps reveal themselves less diffidently under other
                  tests.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6660-00000034"/>
               <p>The last four or five years of his life Balder had spent in acquiring such culture
                  as schools could not give him. Where he went, what he did and saw, we shall not
                  exercise our power categorically to reveal; remarking only that his means and his
                  social rank left him free to go as high as well as low as he pleased,—to dine with
                  English dukes or with Russian serfs. But a fine chastity inherent in his Northern
                  blood had, whatever were his moral convictions, kept him from the mire; and the
                  sudden death of his father had given him a graver turn than was normal to his
                  years. Meanwhile, the financial crash, which at this time so largely affected
                  Europe, swallowed up the greater part of Balder's fortune; and with the remnant
                  (about a thousand pounds sterling), and a potential independence (in the shape of
                  a learned profession) in his head, he sailed for Boston.</p>
               <p>"I knew you were my uncle Hiero's bankers," he added, "and I supposed you would be
                  able to tell me about him. He is my only living relative."</p>
               <p>"Why, as to that, I believe it is a long time since the house has had anything to
                  do with his concerns," returned the venerable President, abstractedly gazing at
                  Balder's high boots; "but I'll ask Mr. Dyke. He remembers everything."</p>
               <p>That gentleman (who had not passed an easy moment since Mr. Helwyse's arrival) was
                  now called in, and his suspense regarding the mysterious visitor soon relieved. In
                  respect to Doctor Glyphic's affair he was ready and explicit.</p>
               <p>"No dollar of his money has been through our hands since winter of Eighteen
                  thirty-five—six, Mr. Helwyse, sir,—winter following your and your respected
                  father's departure for foreign parts," stated Mr. Dyke, straightening his mouth,
                  and planting his first on his hip.</p>
               <p>"Hm—hm!" murmured the President, standing thin and bent before the empty
                  fireplace, a coat-tail over each arm.</p>
               <p>"You have heard nothing of him since then?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Mr. Helwyse, sir! Reverend Manetho Glyphic—understood to be the Doctor's
                  adopted son—came here and effected the transfer, under authority, of course, of
                  his foster-father's signature. Where the property is at this moment, how invested,
                  with what returns, neither the President nor I can inform you, sir."</p>
               <p>"Hm—hm!" remarked Mr. MacGentle again. It was a favorite comment of his upon
                  business topics.</p>
               <p>"It is possible I may be a very wealthy man," said Balder, when Mr. Dyke had made
                  his resolute bow and withdrawn. "But I hope my uncle is alive. It would be a loss
                  not to have known so eccentric a man. I have a miniature of him which I have often
                     studied,<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6660-00000035"/> so that I shall know him when
                  we meet. Can he be married, do you think?"</p>
               <p>"Why no, Balder; no, I should hardly think so," answered Mr. MacGentle, who, at
                  the departure of his confidential clerk, had relapsed into his unofficial position
                  and manner. "By the way, do <emph>you</emph> contemplate that step?"</p>
               <p>"It is said to be an impediment to great enterprises. I could learn little by
                  domestic life that I could not learn better otherwise."</p>
               <p>"Hm,—we could not do without woman, you know."</p>
               <p>"If I could marry Woman, I would do it," said the young man, unblushingly. "But a
                  single crumb from that great loaf would be of no use to me."</p>
               <p>"Ah, you haven't learned to appreciate women! You never knew your mother, Balder;
                  and your sister was lost before she was old enough to be anything to you. By the
                  way, I have always cherished a hope that she might yet be found. Perhaps she
                  may,—perhaps she may."</p>
               <p>Balder looked perplexed, till, thinking the old gentleman might be referring to a
                  reunion in a future state, he said,—</p>
               <p>"You believe that people recognize one another in the next world, Mr.
                  MacGentle?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps,—perhaps; but why not here as well?" murmured the other, in reply; and
                  Balder, suspecting a return of absent-mindedness, yielded the point. He had grown
                  up in the belief that his twin-sister had died in her infancy; but his venerable
                  friend appeared to be under a different impression.</p>
               <p>"I shall go to New York, and try to find my uncle, or some trace of him," said he.
                  "If I'm unsuccessful, I mean to come back here, and settle as a physician."</p>
               <p>"What is your specialty?"</p>
               <p>"I'm an eye-doctor. The Boston people are not all clear-eyed, I hope."</p>
               <p>"Not all,—I should say not all; perhaps you may be able to help me, to begin
                  with," said Mr. MacGentle, with a gleam of melancholy humor. "I will ask Mr. Dyke
                  about the chances for a practice; he knows everything. And, Balder," he added,
                  when the young man rose to go, "let me hear from you, and see you again sometimes,
                  whatever may happen to you in the way of fortune. I'm rather a lonely old man,—a
                  lonely old man, Balder."</p>
               <p>"I'll be here again very soon,—unless I get married, or commit a murder or some
                  such enormity," rejoined Helwyse, his long mustache curving to his smile. They
                  shook hands,—the vigorous young god of the sun and the faded old wraith of
                  Brahmanism,—with a friendly look into each other's eyes.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE VAGARIES OF HELWYSE.</head>
               <p>BALDER HELWYSE was a man full of natural and healthy instincts: he was not afraid
                  to laugh uproariously when so inclined; nor apt to counterfeit so much as a smile,
                  only because a smile would look well. What showed a rarer audacity,—he had more
                  than once dared to weep! To crush down real emotions formed, in short, no part of
                  his ideal of a man. Not belonging to the Little-pot-soon-hot family, he had,
                  perhaps, never found occasion to go beyond the control of his temper, and blind
                  rage he would in no wise allow himself; but he delighted in antagonisms, and
                  though it came not within his rules to hate any man, he was inclined to cultivate
                  an enemy, as more likely to be instructive than some friends. His love of actual
                  battle was intense: he had punched heads with many a hard-fisted school-boy in
                  England; he bore the scar of a German <foreign xml:lang="DEU">schläger</foreign>
                  high up on his forehead; and later, in Paris, he had deliberately invaded the
                  susceptibilities of a French journalist, had followed him to the field of honor,
                  and been there run through the body with a small-sword, to the satisfaction of
                  both parties. He was confined to his bed for a while; but his overflowing spirits
                  healed the wound, to the admiration of his doctors.</p>
               <p>These examples of self-indulgence have been touched upon only by way of preparing
                  the gentle reader for a shock yet more serious. Helwyse was a disciple of
                  Brillat-Savarin,—in one word, a gourmand! His appetite never failed him, and he
                  knew how wisely to direct it. He never ate a careless or thoughtless meal, be its
                  elements simple as they might. He knew and was loved by the foremost cooks all
                  over Europe. Never did he allow coarseness or intemperance to mar the refinement
                  of his palate.</p>
               <p>"Man," he was accustomed to say, "is but a stomach, and the cook is the pope of
                  stomachs, in whose church are no respectable heretics. Our happiness lies in his
                  saucepan,—at the mercy of his spit! Eating is the appropriation to our needs of
                  the good and truth of life, as existing in material manifestation; the cook is the
                  high-priest of that symbolic ceremony! I, and kings with me, bow before him! But
                  his is a responsibility beneath which Atlas might stagger; he, of all men, must be
                  honest, warm-hearted, quick of sympathy, full of compassion towards his race. Let
                  him rejoice, for the world extols him for its well-being;—yet tremble! lest upon
                  his head fall the curse of its misery!"</p>

               <p>This speech was always received with applause; the peroration being delivered with
                  a vast controlled emphasis of eye and voice; and it was followed by the drinking
                  of the cook's health. "The generous virtues," Mr. Helwyse would then go on to say,
                  "arise from the cultivation of the stomach. From man's very earthliness springs
                  the flower of his spiritual virtue. We affect to despise the flesh, as vile and
                  unworthy. What, then, is flesh made of? of nothing?—let who can, prove that! No,
                  it is made of spirit,—of the divine, everlasting substance; it is the wall which
                  holds Heaven in place! If there be anything vile in it, it is of the Devil's
                  infusion, and enters not into the argument."</p>
               <p>A man who had expressed such views as these at the most renowned tables of France
                  and England was not likely to forget his principles in the United States.
                  Accordingly, he arose early, as we have seen, on the morning after his arrival,
                  and forced an astonished waiter to marshal him to the kitchen, and introduce him
                  to the cook. The cook of the Granite Hotel at that time was a round, red-lipped
                  Italian, an artist and enthusiast, but whose temper had been much tried by lack of
                  appreciation; and, although his salary was good, he contemplated throwing it over,
                  abandoning the Yankee nation to its fate, and seeking some more congenial field.
                  Balder, who, when the mood was on him, could wield a tongue persuasive as Richard
                  the Third's, talked to this man, and in seven minutes had won his whole heart. The
                  immediate result was a delectable breakfast, but the sequel was a triumph indeed.
                  It seems that the æesthetic Italian had for several days been watching over a
                  brace of plump, truffled partridges. This day they had reached perfection, and
                  were to have been eaten by no less a person than the cook himself. These cherished
                  birds did he now actually offer to make over to his eloquent and sympathetic
                  acquaintance. Balder was deeply moved, and accepted the gift on one
                  condition,—that the donor should share the feast! "When a man serves me up his own
                  heart,—truffled, too,—he must help me eat it," he said, with emotion. The
                  condition imposed was, after faint resistance, agreed to; the other episodes of
                  the bill of fare were decided upon, and the Italian and the Scandinavian were to
                  dine together that afternoon.</p>
               <p>It still lacked something of the dinner-hour when Mr. Helwyse came out through the
                  dark passageway of the Beacon Hill Bank, and paused for a few moments on the
                  threshold, looking up and down the street. Against the dark background he made a
                  handsome picture,—tall, gallant, unique. The May sunshine, falling athwart the
                  face of the gloomy old building, was glad to light up the waves of his beard<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6660-00000038"/> and hair, and to cast the shadow of his
                  hat-brim over his forehead and eyes. The picture stays just long enough to fix
                  itself in the memory, and then the young man goes lightly down the worn steps, and
                  is lost along the crowded street. Such as he is now, we shall not see him standing
                  in that dark frame again!</p>
               <p>Wherever he went, Balder Helwyse was sure to be stared at; but to this he was
                  admirably indifferent. He never thought of speculating about what people thought
                  of Mr. Helwyse; but to his own approval—something not lightly to be had—he was by
                  no means indifferent. Towards mankind at large he showed a kindly but irreverent
                  charity, which excused imperfection, not so much from a divine principle of love
                  as from scepticism as to man's sufficient motive and faculty to do well. Of
                  himself he was a blunt and sarcastic critic, perhaps because he expected more of
                  himself than of the rest of the world, and fancied that that person only had the
                  ability to be his censor!</p>
               <p>If the Christian reader regards this mental attitude as unsound, far be it from us
                  to defend it! It must, nevertheless, be admitted that whoever feels the strong
                  stirring of power in his head and hands will learn its limits from no purely
                  subjective source. The lesson must begin from without, and the only argument will
                  be a deadly struggle. Until then, self-esteem, however veiled beneath
                  self-criticism, cannot but increase. And if the man has had wisdom and strength to
                  abstain from vulgar self-pollution, Satan must intrust his spear to no
                  half-fledged devil, but grasp it in his own hand, and join battle in his own
                  person.</p>
               <p>Undismayed by this fact, Helwyse reached Washington Street, and followed its
                  westerly meanderings, meaning to spend part of the interval before dinner in
                  exploring Boston. He walked with an easy sideways-swaying of the shoulders,
                  whisking his cane, and smiling to himself as he recalled the points of his
                  interview with the President.</p>
               <p>"Just the thing, to make MacGentle tutelary divinity of so elusive a matter as
                  money! Wonder whether the Directors ever thought of that? For all his unreality,
                  though, he has something more real in him than the heaviest Director on the
                  Board!</p>
               <p>"How composedly he took me for my father! and when he discovered his mistake, how
                  composedly he welcomed me in my own person! Was that the extreme of senility? or
                  was it a subtile assertion of the fact, that he who keeps in the vanguard of the
                  age in a certain sense contains his father—the past—within himself, and is a
                  distinct person chiefly by virtue of that containing power?</p>
               <p>"Why didn't I ask him more about my foster-cousin Manetho? Egyptians are more
                  astute than affectionate. Would he cleave to my poor uncle for<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000039"/> these last eighteen years merely for love? Why did
                  he transfer that money so soon after we sailed? Ten to one, he has in his own
                  hands the future as well as the present disposal of Doctor Hiero Glyphic's
                  fortune! The old gentleman has had time to make a hundred wills since the one he
                  showed my father, twenty years ago!</p>
               <p>"Well, and what is that to you? Ah, Balder Helwyse, you lazy impostor, you are
                  pining for Egyptian flesh-pots! Don't tell me about civility to relatives, and the
                  study of human nature! You are as bad as you accuse your poor cousin of being,—who
                  may be dead, or pastor of a small parish, for all you know. And yet every
                  school-girl can prattle of the educational uses of poverty, and of having to make
                  one's own living! I have a good mind to take your thousand pounds sterling out of
                  your pocket and throw them into Charles River,—and then begin at the beginning! By
                  the time I'd learnt what poverty can teach, it would be over,—or I am no true man!
                  Only they who are ashamed of themselves, or afraid of other people, need to start
                  rich."</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, he could not do otherwise than hunt up the only relative he had in
                  America. Subsequent events did not convict him of being a mere egotist, swayed
                  only by the current of base success. He did not despise prosperity, but he cared
                  yet more to find out truths about things and men. This is not the story of a
                  fortune-hunter; not, at all events, of a hunter of such fortunes as are made and
                  lost nowadays. But, when one half of a man detects unworthy motives in the other
                  half, it is embarrassing. He acts most wisely, perhaps, who drops discussion, and
                  lets the balance of good and bad, at the given moment, decide. Our compound life
                  makes many compromises, whereby our progress, whether heavenward or hellward, is
                  made slow—and sure!</p>
               <p>Here, or hereabouts, Balder lost his way. When thinking hard, he was beside
                  himself; he strode, and tossed his beard, and shouldered inoffensive people aside,
                  and drew his eyebrows together, or smiled. Then, by and by, he would awake to
                  realities, and find himself he knew not where.</p>
               <p>This time, it was in an unsavory back-street; some dirty children were playing in
                  the gutters, and a tall, rather flashily dressed man was walking along some
                  distance ahead, carrying something in one hand. Helwyse at first mended his pace
                  to overtake the fellow, and ask the way to the hotel. But he presently changed his
                  purpose, his attention being drawn to the oddity of the other's behavior.</p>
               <p>The man was evidently one of those who live much alone, and so contract
                  unconscious habits, against which society offers the only safeguard. He was
                     absorbed<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6660-00000040"/> sorbed in some imaginary
                  dialogue; and so imperfectly could his fleshly veil conceal his mental processes,
                  that he gesticulated everything that passed through his mind. These gestures,
                  though perfectly apparent to a steady observer, were so far kept within bounds as
                  not to get more than momentary notice from the passers-by, who, indeed, found
                  metal more attractive to their gaze in Helwyse.</p>
               <p>Now did the man draw his head back and spread out his arms, as in surprise and
                  repudiation; now his shoulders rose high, in deprecation or disclaimer. Now his
                  forefinger cunningly sought the side of his nose; now his fist shook in an
                  imaginary face. At times he would stretch out a pleading arm and neck; the next
                  moment he was an inflexible tyrant, spurning a suppliant. Again he would break
                  into a soundless chuckle; then, raising his hand to his forehead, seem overwhelmed
                  with despair and anguish. Occasionally he would walk some distance quite
                  passively, only glancing furtively about him; but erelong he would forget himself
                  again, and the dialogue would begin anew.</p>
               <p>Balder watched the man curiously, but without seeming to perceive the rather
                  grisly similitude between the latter's vagaries and his own.</p>
               <p>"What an ugly thing the inside of this person seems to be!" he said. "But then,
                  whose thoughts and emotions would not render him a laughing-stock if they could be
                  seen? If everybody looked, to his fellow, as he really is, or even as he looks to
                  himself, mankind would fly asunder, and think the stars hiding-places not remote
                  enough! How many men in the world could walk from one end of the street they live
                  in to the other, talking and acting their inmost thoughts all the way, and retain
                  a bit of anybody's respect or love afterwards? No wonder Heaven is pure, if our
                  spiritual bodies are only thoughts and feelings! and a Hell where every devil saw
                  his fellow's deformity outwardly manifested would be Hell indeed!</p>
               <p>"But that can't be. Angels behold their own loveliness, because doing so makes
                  them lovelier; but no devil could know his own vileness and live. They think their
                  hideousness charming, and, when the darkness is thickest about them, most firmly
                  believe themselves in Heaven. But the light of Heaven would be real darkness to
                  them, for a ray of it would strike them blind!"</p>
               <p>Helwyse was too prone to moralizing. It shall not be our cue to quote him, save
                  when to do so may seem to serve an ulterior purpose.</p>
               <p>"I would like to hear the story that fellow is so exercised about," muttered his
                  pursuer. "How do I know it doesn't concern me? That violin-box he<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000041"/> carries is very much in his way; shall I offer to
                  carry it for him, and, in return, hear his story? If the music soothes his soul as
                  much as the box moderates his gestures—"</p>
               <p>Here the man abruptly turned into a doorway, and was gone. On coming up, Helwyse
                  found that the doorway led in through a pair of green folding-doors to some place
                  unseen. The house had an air of villanous respectability,—a gambling-house air, or
                  worse. Did the musician live there? Helwyse paused but a moment, and then walked
                  on; and thus, sagacious reader, the meeting was for the second time put off.</p>
               <p>When he reached his hotel, he had only half an hour to dress for dinner in; but he
                  prepared himself faultlessly, chanting a sort of hymn to Appetite the while.
                  "Hunger," quoth he, "is mightiest of magicians; breeds hope, energy, brains;
                  prompts to love and friendship. Hunger gives day and night their meaning, and
                  makes the pulse of time beat; creates society, industry, and rank. Hunger moves
                  man to join in the work of creation,—to harmonize himself with the music of the
                  universe,—to feel ambition, joy, and sorrow. Hunger unites man to nature in the
                  ever-recurring inspiration to food, followed by the ever-alternating ecstasy of
                  digestion. Morning tunes his heart to joy, for the benison of breakfast awaits
                  him. The sun scales heaven to light him to his noonday meal. Evening wooes him
                  supperwards, and night brings timeless sleep, to waft him to another dawn. Eating
                  is earth's first law, and heaven itself could not subsist without it!"</p>
               <p>So Balder Helwyse and the cook feasted gloriously that afternoon, in the back
                  pantry, and they solemnly installed the partridges among the constellations!</p>

               <head>VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A QUARREL.</head>
               <p>THAT same afternoon Mr. MacGentle put his head into the outer office and said,
                  "Mr. Dyke, could I speak with you a moment?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dyke scraped back his chair and went in, with his polished bald head, and
                  square face and figure,—a block of common-sense. He was more common-sensible than
                  usual, that afternoon, because he had so strangely forgotten himself in the
                  morning. Mr. MacGentle was in his usual position for talking with his confidential
                  clerk,—standing up with his back to the fireplace, and his coat-tails over his
                  arms. Experience had taught him that this attitude was better adapted than any
                  other to sustain the crushing weight of Mr. Dyke's sense. To have conversed with
                  him in a sitting position would have been to lose breath and vitality before the
                  end of five minutes.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Helwyse has thoughts of settling in Boston to practise his profession," began
                  the President, gently. "I told him you would be likely to know what the chances
                  are."</p>
               <p>"Profession is—what?" demanded Mr. Dyke, settling his. fist on his hip.</p>
               <p>"O—doctor—physician; eye-doctor, he said, I think."</p>
               <p>"Eye-doctor? Well, Dr. Schlemm won't last the winter; may drop any day. Just the
                  thing for Mr. Helwyse,—Dr. Helwyse." And the subject, being discussed at some
                  length between the two gentlemen, took on a promising aspect. His house was picked
                  out for the new incumbent, his earnings calculated, his success foretold. Two
                  characters so diverse as were the President and his clerk united, it seems, in
                  liking the young physician.</p>
               <p>"Married?" asked Mr. Dyke, after a pause.</p>
               <p>"Why, no,—no; and he doesn't seem inclined to marry. But he is quite young;
                  perhaps he may, later on in life, Mr. Dyke."</p>
               <p>The elderly clerk straightened his mouth. "Matter of taste—and policy. Gives
                  solidity,—position;—and is an expense and a responsibility." Mr. Dyke himself was
                  well known to be the husband of an idolized wife, and the father of a despotic
                  family.</p>
               <p>"He never had the advantage of woman's influence in his childhood, you know. His
                  poor mother died in giving him and his sister birth; and the sister was
                  lost,—stolen away, two or three years later. He does not appreciate woman at her
                  true value," murmured MacGentle.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6660-00000043"/>
               <p>"Stolen away? His sister died in infancy,—so I understood, sir," said the clerk,
                  whose versions of past events were apt to differ from the President's.</p>
               <p>But the President—perhaps because he was conscious that his memory regarding
                  things of recent occurrence was treacherous—was abnormally sensitive as to the
                  correctness of his more distant reminiscences.</p>
               <p>"O no, she was stolen,—stolen by her nurse, just before Thor Helwyse went to
                  Europe, I think," said he.</p>
               <p>"Beg your pardon, sir," said Mr. Dyke, with an iron smile; "died,—burnt to death
                  in her first year,—yes, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dyke," rejoined MacGentle, dignifiedly, lifting his chin high above his
                  stock, "I have myself seen the little girl, then in her third year, pulling her
                  brother's hair on the nursery floor. She was dark-eyed,—a very lovely child. As to
                  the burning, I now recollect that when the house in Brooklyn took fire, the child
                  was in danger, but was rescued by her nurse, who herself received very severe
                  injuries."</p>
               <p>Mr. Dyke heaved a long, deliberate sigh, and allowed his eyes to wander slowly
                  round the room, before replying.</p>
               <p>"You are not a family man, Mr. MacGentle, sir! Don't blame you, sir! Your memory,
                  perhaps— But no matter! The nurse who stole the child was, I presume, the same who
                  rescued her from the fire?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Dyke perhaps intended to give a delicately ironical emphasis to this question,
                  but his irony was apt to be a rather unwieldy and unmistakable affair. The truth
                  was, he was a little staggered by the President's circumstantial statement; whence
                  his deliberation, and his not entirely pertinent rejoinder about "a family
                  man."</p>
               <p>"And why not the same, sir? I ask you, why not the same?" demanded Mr. MacGentle,
                  with slender imperiousness.</p>
               <p>But, by this time, Mr. Dyke had thought of a new argument.</p>
               <p>"The little girl, I understood you to say, was dark? Since she was the twin-sister
                  of one of Mr. Balder Helwyse's complexion, that is odd, Mr. MacGentle,—odd, sir."
                  And the solid family man fixed his sharp brown eyes full upon the unsubstantial
                  bachelor. The latter's delicate nostrils expanded, and a pink flush rose to his
                  faded cheeks. He was now as haughty and superb as a paladin.</p>
               <p>"I will discuss business subjects with my subordinates, Mr. Dyke; not other
                  subjects, if you please! This dispute was not begun by me. Let it be carried no
                  further, sir! Twins are not necessarily, nor invariably, of the same complexion.
                  Let nothing more be<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6660-00000044"/> said, Mr. Dyke. I
                  trust the little girl may yet be found and restored to her family—to—to her
                  brother! I trust she may yet be found, sir!" And he glared at Mr. Dyke
                  aggressively.</p>
               <p>"I trust you may live to see it, Mr. MacGentle, sir!" said the confidential clerk,
                  shifting his ground in a truly masterly manner; and before the President could
                  recover, he had bowed and gone out. Ten minutes afterwards MacGentle opened the
                  door, and lo! Dyke himself on the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Dyke!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. MacGentle!" in the same breath.</p>
               <p>"I—Mr. Dyke, let me apologize for my asperity,—for my rudeness," says MacGentle,
                  stepping forward and holding out his thin white hand, his eyebrows more raised
                  than ever, the corners of his mouth more depressed. "I am sincerely sorry
                  that—that—"</p>
               <p>"O sir!" cries the square clerk, grasping the thin hand in both his square palms;
                  "O sir! O sir! No, no!—no, no! I was just coming to beg you— My fault,—my fault,
                  Mr. MacGentle, sir! No, no!"</p>
               <p>Thus incoherently ended the quarrel between these two old friends, the dispute
                  being left undecided. But the important point was established that Balder Helwyse
                  was insured a practice in Boston, in case his uncle Glyphic's fortune failed to
                  enrich him.</p>

               <head type="sub">A COLLISION IMMINENT.</head>
               <p>A LARGE, handsome steamer was the "Empire State," of the line which ran between
                  Newport and New York. She was painted white, had walking beam engines, and
                  ornamented paddle-boxes, and had been known to run nearly twenty knots in an hour.
                  On the evening of the twenty-seventh of May, in the year of which we write, she
                  left her Newport dock as usual, with a full list of passengers. On getting out of
                  the harbor, she steamed into a bank of solid fog, and only got out of it the next
                  morning, just before passing Hellgate, at the head of East River, New York. On the
                  passage down Long Island Sound she met with an accident. She ran into the schooner
                  Resurrection, which was lying becalmed across her course, carrying away most of
                  the schooner's bowsprit, but doing no serious damage. This, however, was not the
                  worst. On arriving in New York, it was found that one of the passengers was
                  missing! He had fallen overboard during the night, possibly at the time of the
                  collision.</p>
               <p>Balder Halwyse was on board. After dining with<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000045"/> the cook, and smoking a real Havana cigar (probably
                  the first real one that he had ever been blessed with), he put a package of the
                  same brand in his travelling-bag, bade his entertainer,—who had solemnly engaged
                  to remain in Boston for Mr. Helwyse's sole sake,—bade his fellow-convivialist good
                  by, and took the train to Newport, and from there the "Empire State" for New
                  York.</p>
               <p>The darkness was the most impenetrable that the young man had ever seen; Long
                  Island Sound was like a pocket. The passengers—those who did not go to their
                  state-rooms at once—sat in the cabin reading, or dozing on the chairs and sofas. A
                  few men stayed out on deck for an hour or two, smoking; but at last they too went
                  in. The darkness was appalling. The officer on the bridge blew his steam
                  fog-whistle every few minutes, and kept his lanterns hung out; but they must have
                  been invisible at sixty yards.</p>
               <p>Helwyse kept the deck alone. Apparently he meant to smoke his whole bundle of
                  cigars before turning in. He paced up and down, Napoleon-like in his high boots,
                  until finally he was brought to a stand by the blind night-wall, which no man can
                  either scale or circumvent. Then he leaned on the railing and looked against the
                  darkness. Not a light to be seen in heaven or on earth! The water below whispered
                  and swirled past, torn to soft fragments by the gigantic paddle-wheel. Helwyse's
                  beard was wet and his hands sticky with the salt mist.</p>
               <p>Ever and anon sounded the fog-whistle, hoarsely, as though the fog had got in its
                  throat; and the pale glare of a lantern, fastened aloft somewhere, lighted up the
                  white issuing steam for a moment. There was no wind; one was conscious of motion,
                  but all sense of direction and position—save to the steersman—was lost. Helwyse
                  could see the red end of his cigar, and very cosey and friendly it looked; but he
                  could see nothing else.</p>
               <p>It is said that staid and respectable people, when thoroughly steeped in night,
                  will sometimes break out in wild grimaces and outlandish gesticulations. It is
                  certainly the time when unlawful thoughts and words come to men most readily and
                  naturally. Night brings forth many things that daylight starts from. The real
                  power of darkness lies not in merely baffling the eyesight, but in creating the
                  feeling of darkness in the soul. The chains of light are broken, and we can almost
                  believe our internal night to be as impenetrable to God's eyes as that external,
                  to our own!</p>
               <p>By and by Helwyse thought he would find some snug place and sit down. The cabin of
                  the "Empire State" was built on the main deck, abaft the funnel, like a long, low
                  house. Between the stern end of this house and the taffrail was a small space,
                     thickly<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6660-00000046"/> grown with camp-stools.
                  Helwyse groped his way thither, got hold of a couple of the camp-stools, and
                  arranged himself comfortably with his back against the cabin wall. The waves
                  bubbled invisibly in the wake beneath. After sitting for a while in the dense
                  blackness, Helwyse began to feel as though his whole physical self were shrivelled
                  into a single atom, careering blindly through infinite space!</p>
               <p>After all, and really, was he anything more? If he chose to think not, what logic
                  could convince him of the contrary? Visible creation, as any child could tell him,
                  was an illusion,—was not what it seemed to be. But this darkness was no illusion!
                  Why, then, was it not the only reality? and he but an atom, charged with a vital
                  power of so-called senses, that generally deceived him, but sometimes—as now—let
                  him glimpse the truth? The fancy, absurd as it was, had its attraction for the
                  time being. This great living, staring world of men and things is a terrible
                  weight to lug upon one's back. But if man be an invisible atom, what a vast, wild,
                  boundless freedom is his! Infinite space is wide enough to cut any caper in, and
                  no one the wiser.</p>
               <p>One would like to converse with a man who had been born and had lived in solitude
                  and darkness. What original views he would have about himself and life! Would he
                  think himself an abstract intelligence, out of space and time? What a riddle his
                  physical sensations would be to him! Or, suppose him to meet with another being
                  brought up in the same way; how they would mystify each other! Would they learn to
                  feel shame, love, hate? or do the passions only grow in sunshine? Would they ever
                  laugh? Would they hatch plots against each other, lie, deceive? Would they have
                  secrets from each other?</p>
               <p>But, fancy aside, take a supposable case. Suppose two sinners of our daylight
                  world to meet for the first time, mutually unknown, on a night like this.
                  Invisible, only audible, how might they plunge profound into most naked
                  intimacy,—read aloud to each other the secrets of their deepest hearts! Would the
                  confession lighten their souls, or make them twice as heavy as before? Then, the
                  next morning, they might meet and pass, unrecognizing and unrecognized. But would
                  the knot binding them to each other be any the less real, because neither knew to
                  whom he was tied? Some day, in the midst of friends, in the brightest glare of the
                  sunshine, the tone of a voice would strike them pale and cold.</p>
               <p>Somewhat after this fashion, perhaps, did Helwyse commune with himself. He liked
                  to follow the whim of the moment, whither it would lead him. He was romantic; it
                  was one of his agreeablest traits, because spontaneous; and he indulged it the
                  more, as being<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6660-00000047"/> confident that he had too
                  much solid ballast in the hold to be in danger of upsetting. To-night, at this
                  point of his mental ramble, he found that his cigar had gone out. Had he been
                  thinking aloud? He believed not, and yet there was no telling; he often did so,
                  unconsciously. Were it so, and were any one listening, that person had him
                  decidedly at advantage!</p>
               <p>What put it into his head that some one might be listening? It may have come by
                  pure accident,—if there be such a thing. The idea returned, stealing over his mind
                  like a chilling breath. What if some one had all along been close beside him, with
                  eyes fixed upon him! Helwyse found himself sitting perfectly still, holding his
                  breath to listen. There was no disguising it,—he felt uneasy. He wished his cigar
                  had not gone out. On second thoughts, he wished there had not been any cigar at
                  all, because, if any one were near, the cigar must have pointed out the smoker's
                  precise position. The uneasiness did not lessen, but grew more defined.</p>
               <p>It was like the sensation felt when pointed at by a human finger, or stared at
                  persistently. Was there indeed any one near? No sound or movement gave answer, but
                  the odd sensation continued. Helwyse fancied he could now tell whence it
                  came;—from the left, and not far away. He peered earnestly thitherward, but his
                  eyes only swallowed blackness.</p>
               <p>Was not this carrying a whim to a foolish length? If he thought he had a
                  companion, why not speak, and end the doubt? But the dense silence, darkness,
                  uncertainty, made common-sense seem out of place. The whole black fog, the sea,
                  the earth itself, seemed to be pressing down his will! The longer he delayed, the
                  weaker he grew.</p>
               <p>A slight shifting of his position caused him all at once to encounter the eyes of
                  the unseen presence with his own! The stout-nerved young fellow was startled to
                  the very heart. Was the unseen presence startled also? At all events, the shock
                  found Balder Helwyse his tongue, seldom before tied up without his consent.</p>
               <p>"I hope I'm not disturbing your solitude. You are not a noisy neighbor, sir."</p>
               <p>So flat fell the words on the blank darkness, it seemed as if there could never be
                  a reply. Nevertheless, a reply came.</p>
               <p>"You must come much nearer me than you are, to disturb my solitude. It does not
                  consist in being without a companion."</p>
               <p>The quality of this voice of darkness was peculiar. It sounded old, yet of an age
                  that had not outlived the devil of youth. Probably the invisibility of the speaker
                  enhanced its effect. With most of the elements of pleasing, it was nevertheless
                  repulsive. It was soft, fluent, polished, but savage license was not far off,<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6660-00000048"/> hard held by a slender leash; an
                  underlying suggestion of harsh discordance. The utterance, though somewhat rapid,
                  was carefully distinct.</p>
               <p>Helwyse had the gift of familiarity,—of that rare kind of familiarity which does
                  not degenerate into contempt. But there was an incongruity about this person, hard
                  to assimilate. In a couple of not very original sentences, he had wrought upon his
                  listener an effect of depraved intellectual power, strangely combined with artless
                  simplicity,—an unspeakably distasteful conjunction! Imagination, freed from the
                  check of the senses, easily becomes grotesque; and Helwyse, unable to see his
                  companion, had no difficulty in picturing him as a grisly monster, having a
                  satanic head set upon the ingenuous shoulders of a child. And what was Helwyse
                  himself? No longer, surely, the gravely humorous moralizer? The laws of harmony
                  forbid! He is a monster likewise; say—since grotesqueness is in vogue—the heart of
                  Lucifer burning beneath the cool brain of a Grecian sage. The symbolism is not
                  inapt, since Helwyse, while afflicted with pride and ambition as abstract as
                  boundless, had, at the same time, a logical, fearless brain, and keen delight in
                  beauty.</p>
               <p>"I was just thinking," remarked the latter monster, "that this was a good place
                  for confidential conversation."</p>
               <p>"You believe, then, that talking relieves the mind?" rejoined the former,
                  softly.</p>
               <p>"I believe a thief or a murderer would be glad of an hour—such as now passes—to
                  impart the story of what is dragging him to Hell. And even the best houses are
                  better for an airing!"</p>
               <p>"A pregnant idea! There are certainly some topics one would like to discuss, free
                  from the restraint that responsibility imposes. Have you ever reflected on the
                  subject of omnipotence?"</p>
               <p>Somewhat confounded at this bold question, Helwyse hesitated a moment.</p>
               <p>"I can't see you, remember, any more than you can see me," insinuated the voice,
                  demurely.</p>
               <p>"I believe I have sometimes asked myself whether it were obtainable,—how it might
                  best be approximated," admitted Helwyse, cautiously; for he began to feel that
                  even darkness might be too transparent for the utterance of some thoughts.</p>
               <p>"But you never got a satisfactory answer, and are not therefore omnipotent? Well,
                  the reason probably is, that you started wrongly. Did it ever occur to you to try
                  the method of sin?"</p>
               <p>"To obtain omnipotence? No!"</p>
               <p>"It wouldn't be right,—eh?" chuckled the voice. "But then one must lay aside
                  prejudice if one wants to be all-powerful! Now, sin denotes separation; the<pb
                     n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6660-00000049"/> very etymology of the word should have
                  attracted the attention of an ambitious man, such as you seem to be. It is a path
                  separate from all other paths, and therefore worth exploring."</p>
               <p>"It leads to weakness, not to power!"</p>
               <p>"If followed in the wrong spirit, very true. But the wise man sins and is strong!
                  See how frank I am!—But don't let me monopolize the conversation."</p>
               <p>"I should like to hear your argument, if you have one. You are a prophet of new
                  things."</p>
               <p>"Sin is an old force, though it may be applied in new ways. Well, you will admit
                  that the true sinner is the only true reformer and philosopher among men? No? I
                  will explain, then. The world is full of discordances, for which man is not to
                  blame. His endeavor to meet and harmonize this discordance is called sin. His
                  indignation at disorder, rebellion against it, attempts to right it, are crimes!
                  That is the vulgar argument which wise men smile at."</p>
               <p>"I may be very dull; but I think your explanations need explaining."</p>
               <p>"We'll take some examples. What is the liar, but one who sees the false relations
                  of things, and seeks to put them in the true? The mission of the thief, again, is
                  to equalize the notoriously unjust distribution of wealth. A fundamental defect in
                  the principles of human association gave birth to the murderer; and as for the
                  adulterer, he is an immortal protest against the absurd laws which interfere
                  between the sexes. Are not these men, and others of similar stamp, the bulwarks of
                  true society,—our leaders towards justice and freedom?"</p>
               <p>Whether this were satire, madness, or earnest, Helwyse could not determine. The
                  night-fog had got into his brain. He made shift, however, to say that the criminal
                  class were not, as a mere matter of fact, the most powerful.</p>
               <p>"Again you misapprehend me," rejoined the voice, with perfect suavity. "No doubt
                  there are many weak and foolish persons who commit crimes,—nay, I will admit that
                  the vast majority of criminals are weak and foolish; but that does not affect the
                  dignity of the true sinner,—he who sins from exalted motives. Ignorance is the
                  only real crime, polluting deeds that, wisely done, are sublime. Sin is
                  culture!"</p>
               <p>"Were I, then, from motives of self-culture, to kill you, I should be taking a
                  long step towards rising in your estimation?" put in Helwyse.</p>
               <p>"Admirable!" softly exclaimed the voice, in a tone as of an approving pat on the
                  back. "Certainly, I should be the last to deny it! But would it not be more for
                  the general good, were I, who have long been a student of these things, to kill a
                  seeming novice like<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6660-00000050"/> you? It would assure
                  me of having had one sincere disciple."</p>
               <p>"I wonder whether he's really mad?" mused Balder Helwyse, shuddering a little in
                  the dampness.</p>
               <p>"But, badinage aside," resumed this loquacious voice, "although there is so much
                  talk and dispute about evil, very few people know what evil essentially is. Now,
                  there are some things, the mere doing of which by the most involuntary agent would
                  at once stamp his soul with the conviction of ineffable sin. He would have touched
                  the essence of evil. And if a wise man has done that, he has had in his hand the
                  key to omnipotence!"</p>
               <p>"It is easily had, then. A man need but take his Leviticus and Deuteronomy, and
                  run through the catalogue of crimes. He would be sure of finding the key hidden
                  beneath some of them."</p>
               <p>"No; you do Moses scant justice. He—shrewd soul!—was too cunning to fall into such
                  an error as that. He forbade a few insignificant and harmless acts, which every
                  one is liable to commit. His policy was no less simple than sagacious. By amusing
                  mankind with such trumpery, he lured them off the scent of true sin. Believe me,
                  the artifice was no idle one. Should mankind learn the secret, a generation would
                  not pass before the world would be turned upside down, and its present Ruler
                  buried in the ruins!"</p>
               <p>At this point, surely, Helwyse got up and went to his state-room without listening
                  to another word?—Not so. The Lucifer in him was getting the better of the sage. He
                  wanted to hear all that the voice of darkness had to say. There might be something
                  new, something instructive in it. He might hear a word that would unbar the door
                  he had striven so long to open. He aimed at knowledge and power beyond recognized
                  human reach. He had taken thought with himself keenly and deeply, but was still
                  uncertain and unsatisfied. Here opened a new avenue, so untried as to transcend
                  common criticism. The temptation to omnipotence is a grand thing, and may have
                  shaken greater men than Helwyse; and he had trained himself to regard it—not
                  exactly as a temptation. As for good or bad methods,—at a certain intellectual
                  height such distinctions vanish. Vulgar immorality he would turn from as from
                  anything vulgar; but refined, philosophic immorality, as a weapon of power,—there
                  was fascination in it.</p>
               <p>—Folly and delusion!—</p>
               <p>But Helwyse was only Helwyse, careering through pitchy darkness, on a viewless
                  sea, with a plausible voice at his ear insinuating villanous thoughts with an air
                  of devilish good-fellowship!</p>
               <p>The "Empire State" was at this moment four and a half miles northeast of the
                  schooner whose bowsprit<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6660-00000051"/> sprit she was
                  destined to carry away. The steamer was making about ten knots an hour; the
                  schooner was slowly drifting with the tide into the line of the steamer's course.
                  The catastrophe was therefore about twenty-seven minutes distant.</p>

               <head>IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE VOICE OF DARKNESS.</head>
               <p>THE fog-whistle screeched dismally. Helwyse took his feet off the camp-stool in
                  front of him, and sat upright.</p>
               <p>"Do you know this secret of sin?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"It must, of course, be an object of speculation to a thoughtful man," answered
                  the voice, modestly parrying the question. "But I assure you that only a man of
                  intellect—of genius—has in him the intelligence, the sublime reach of soul, which
                  could attain the full solution of the problem; they who merely blunder into it
                  would fail to grasp the grand significance of the idea."</p>
               <p>"But you affirm that whoever fairly masters the problem of absolute sin would have
                  God and His kingdom at his mercy?"</p>
               <p>"I am loath to appear boastful; but I apprehend the fact to be not unlike what you
                  suggest," the voice replied, with a subdued gusto. "It would depend upon our
                  hypothetical person's discretion, and his views as to the claims of the august
                  Being who has so long controlled<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6660-00000052"/>
                  trolled the destinies of the human race, how much the existing order of things
                  might have to fear from him. I should imagine that the august Being, if He be as
                  wise as they say He is, would be careful how He treated this hypothetical
                  person!"</p>
               <p>"You are a liar," said Helwyse, unceremoniously.</p>
               <p>"Why is not Satan, who must possess this all-powerful knowledge, supreme over the
                  universe?"</p>
               <p>Instead of taking offence (as Helwyse, to do him justice, hoped it would; for his
                  Berserker blood, which boiled only at heaven-and-hell temperature, was beginning
                  to stir in him),—so far from being offended, the voice only uttered its peculiar
                  quiet chuckle.</p>
               <p>"Your frankness charms me! it proves you worthy to learn. Satan—supposing there be
                  such a personage—divides, with the other august Being, the sovereignty of the
                  spiritual world. Were I a cynic, I should say he owned at least half of the
                  physical world into the bargain! But Satan is only a spirit, and his power over
                  men is but as the power of a dream. Were a Satan to arise in the flesh, so that
                  men could see and touch him, and hear his voice with their fleshy ears,—there were
                  a Satan! Already has the Incarnation of goodness appeared to mankind, and, though
                  the world be moved to virtue only slowly and with reluctance, mark how mighty has
                  been his influence! What think you, then, would be the power of a Christ of evil,
                  showing to men the path they already grope for? I tell you, the human race would
                  be his only; Hell, full to bursting with their hurrying souls, would outweigh
                  Heaven in the balance; the teller of the secret would be king above
                  all,—forever!"</p>
               <p>The sinuous voice twined round the listener's mind, swaddling the vigorous limbs
                  into imbecile inertia. But when before now did a sane human brain let itself be
                  duped by sophistry? This case were worth marking, if only because it is
                  unparalleled.</p>
               <p>"And the only punishable sin is ignorance!" muttered Helwyse.</p>
               <p>"Well, I have thought so, too. And I have questioned whether a man might have
                  power over himself, to put his hand to evil or to good alike, and to remain
                  impartial and impassive; and so make evil and good alike minister to his culture
                  and raise him upwards!"</p>
               <p>"The question does credit to your wit," chimed in the voice of darkness. "Whoever
                  has in him the making of a deity must learn the nature of opposites. The soldier
                  will not join battle without studying the tactics of the enemy. Without
                  experimental knowledge of both evil and good, none but a fool would believe that
                  man can become all-powerful."</p>
               <p>"From the care with which you avoid speaking the name of God, if from no other
                  cause, I should suppose<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6660-00000053"/> you to be the
                  Devil himself!" observed Helwyse, bluntly.</p>
               <p>"Well, profanity is vulgar! As to my being the Devil, it is too dark here for
                  either denial or acknowledgment to be of practical use. But (to be serious)—about
                  this secret—"</p>
               <p>The voice paused interrogatively. Lucifer, speaking through Helwyse's lips,
                  demanded sullenly,—</p>
               <p>"Well, what is the secret?"</p>
               <p>What, indeed! Why, there is no such secret;—it is a bugbear! But the moral
                  perversion of the person who could soberly ask the question that Helwyse asked is
                  not so easily disposed of. It met, indeed, with full recognition. As for the
                  subtile voice, having accomplished its main purpose, it began now to evade the
                  point and to run into digressions; until the collision came, and ended the
                  conversation forever.</p>
               <p>"Unfortunately," said the voice, "the secret is not such as may be told in a word.
                  Like all profound knowledge, it can only be communicated by leading the learner,
                  step by step, over the ground traversed by the original discoverer. Let me, as a
                  sort of preliminary, suppose a case."</p>
               <p>Hereupon ensued a considerable silence, and Helwyse seemed once more a detached
                  atom, flying through infinite darkness without guide or control. Where was
                  he?—what was he? Did the world exist,—the broad earth, the sunny sky, the beauty,
                  the sound, the order and sweet succession of nature? Was he a shadow that had
                  dreamed for a moment a strange dream, and would anon be quenched, and know what
                  had seemed Self no more? Strangely, through the doubt and uncertainty, Helwyse
                  felt the pressure of his shoulders against the cabin wall, and the touch of the
                  dead cigar between his fingers.</p>
               <p>The voice, resuming, restored him to a reality that seemed less, trustworthy than
                  the doubt. The tone was not quite the same as heretofore. The smooth mocking had
                  given place to a hurried excitement, alien to the philosophic temperament.</p>
               <p>"A man kidnaps the child of his enemy, through the child to revenge himself. Kill
                  it?—no! he is no short-sighted bungler; he has refinement, foresight,
                  understanding. She is but an infant,—open and impressible, warm and sanguine! He
                  isolates her from sight and reach. He pries into her nature with keenest
                  delicacy,—no leaf is unread. Being learnt, he works upon it; touches each budding
                  trait with gentlest impulse. No violence! he seems to leave her to her own
                  development; yet nothing goes against his will. More than half is left to nature,
                  but his scarce perceptible touches bias nature. Ah! the idealization of
                  education!"</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6660-00000054"/>
               <p>"This sounds more real than hypothetical!" thought Helwyse.</p>
               <p>"So cunning was he, he reversed in her mind the universal law. Evil was good;
                  good, evil. She grew fast and strong, for evil is the sweeter food; it is rich
                  earth to the plant. She never knew that evil existed, yet evil was all she knew!
                  For whatever is forced reacts; he never taught her positive sin, lest she
                  perversely turn to good."</p>
               <p>"Did he mean insensibly to initiate her into the knowledge of absolute sin?"</p>
               <p>"Such would be his purpose,—such would be his purpose. To make her a devil,
                  without the chance of knowing it possible to be anything else!"</p>
               <p>"He was a fool," growled Helwyse. "The plan is folly,—impracticable in twenty
                  ways. A soul cannot be so influenced. Devils are not made by education. The only
                  devil would be the educator!"</p>
               <p>But the voice had forgotten his presence. It ceased not to mutter to itself while
                  he was speaking, and now it broke forth again.</p>
               <p>"Years have passed,—she is a woman now. She knows not that the world exists. All
                  is yet latent within her. But the time is at hand when the hidden forces shall
                  flower! Plunged into life, with nothing to hold by, no truth, no divine help; her
                  marvellous powers and passions in full strength,—all trained to drag her down,—not
                  one aspiring; maddened by new thoughts, limitless opportunities opening before
                  her,—she will plunge into such an abyss of sin as has been undreamt of since the
                  Deluge!"</p>
               <p>"Well,—what of it? what is the upshot?" questioned Helwyse with sullen impatience.
                  The emotion now apparent in the voice, uncanny though it was, counteracted the
                  spell wrought by its purely intellectual depravity. Helwyse was perhaps beginning
                  to understand that he had ventured his stock of virgin gold for a handful of
                  unclean waste-paper!</p>
               <p>"He will come back,—her father,—my enemy! I have waited for him from youth to age.
                  I have seen him in my dreams, and in visions. I am with him continually,—we talk
                  together. At first, cringingly and softly, I lead him to recall the past, to speak
                  of the dead wife,—the lost child,—her baby ways and words. I lure him on till
                  imagination has fired his love and given life and vividness to his memory. Then I
                  whisper,—She lives! she is near! in a moment he shall behold her! And while his
                  heart beats and he trembles, I bring her forth in her beauty. Take her! your
                  daughter! the one devil on earth; but devils shall spring like grass in the track
                  of her footsteps!"</p>
               <p>The voice had worked itself into a frenzy, and, forgetting caution, had crazily
                  exposed itself. Its owner<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6660-00000055"/> was probably
                  some poor lunatic, subject to fits of madness. But Helwyse was full of scorn and
                  anger, born of that bitterest disappointment which admits not even the poor
                  consolation of having worthily aspired. He had been duped,—and by the cobwebs of a
                  madman's brain! He broke into a short laugh, harsh to the ear, and answering to no
                  mirthful impulse.</p>
               <p>"So! you are the hero of your story? You have brooded all your life over a crazy
                  scheme of stabbing a father through his child, until you have become as blind as
                  you are vicious! As for the girl, you may have made her ignorant and stupid, or
                  even idiotic; but that she should become queen of Hell or anything of that
                  kind—"</p>
               <p>He stopped, for his unseen companion was evidently beyond hearing him. The man
                  seemed to be actually struggling in a fit,—gasping and choking. It was a piteous
                  business,—not less piteous than revolting. But Helwyse felt no pity,—only ugly,
                  hateful, unrelenting anger, needing not much stirring to blaze forth in fearful
                  passion. Where now were his wise saws,—his philosophic indifference? Self-respect
                  is the pith of such supports; which being gone, the supports fail.</p>
               <p>"My music,—my music!" gasped the voice; "my music, or I shall die!"</p>
               <p>"Die? Yes, it were well you should die. You cumber the earth! Shall I do it?"
                  Helwyse muttered to his heart,—"merely as a means of culture!"</p>
               <p>Perhaps it was said only in a mood of sardonic jesting. The next moment, no doubt,
                  Balder Helwyse would have retired to his cabin, leaving the voice of darkness
                  forever. But at that moment the hurried flash of a lantern on the captain's bridge
                  fell full on the young man's face and shoulders, gleaming in his eyes, and
                  lighting up the masses of yellow hair and mighty beard. He was standing with one
                  hand resting on the taffrail. The dim halo of the fog, folding him about, made him
                  look like a spirit.</p>

               <p>AS the light so fell, hoarse voices shouted, and then a concussion shivered
                  through the steamer, and her headway was slackened. But of this Helwyse knew
                  nothing; for the voice had burst forth in a cry of fear, amazement, and hate; and
                  in another breath he found himself clutched tightly in long, wiry arms, and felt
                  panting breath hot against his face.</p>
               <p>He struggled at first to free himself,—but he was held in the grip of a madman!
                  Then did the turbid current of his blood begin to leap and tingle, and strange
                  half-thoughts darted through his mind like deformed spectres, capering as they
                  flew! The bulwark of his will was overthrown; he could not poise himself long
                  enough to recover his self-sway. He was sliding headlong down a steep, the
                  velocity momently increasing.</p>
               <p>Was it Balder Helwyse that was struggling thus furiously, his body full of fire,
                  his brain of madness, his heart quick-beating with savage, wicked, thirsty joy?
                  His soul—his own no longer—was bestridden by a frantic demon, who, brimming over
                  with hot glee, drove him whirling blindly on, with an ever-growing purpose that
                  surcharged each smallest artery, and furnished a condensed dart of malice
                  wherewith to stab and stab again the opposing soul. He waxed every instant madder,
                  wickeder, more devilishly exultant; and now, although panting, breathless,
                  pricking at every pore from the agony of the strain, he could scarce forbear
                  screaming with delight! for he felt he was gaining, and—O ecstasy!—knew that his
                  adversary felt it also, and that his heart was as full of black despair and terror
                  as was his conqueror's of intolerable triumph! Gaining still!</p>
               <p>Strange, that all through this wild frenzy in which body and soul were rapt, the
                  essential part of Balder Helwyse seemed to be looking on, with a curious,
                  repellent twist of feature, commenting on what was going forward, and noting, with
                  quiet interest and precision, each varying phase of the struggle,—noting, as of
                  significance, that the sway of the demon of murder made the idea of other crimes
                  seem beyond words congenial, enticing, delicious!</p>
               <p>Steadily through this storm of lawless fury has the predestined victory been
                  drawing near! The throbbing of his enemy's heart,—Helwyse feels it; did ever lover
                  so rejoice in the palpitations of his mistress? O the wine of life! drunk from the
                     cup<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6660-00000057"/> of murder! Hear how the wretch's
                  voice breaks choking from his throat!—he would beg for mercy, but cannot, shall
                  not! Keep your fingers in his throat; the other hand creeps warily downwards. Now
                  hurl him up,—over!—</p>
               <p>But with what an ugly gulp the black water swallowed his body!</p>

               <head>XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A DEAD WEIGHT.</head>
               <p>WAS it not well done? Tempted to covet imaginary wickedness, Helwyse was ripe for
                  real crime,—and who so worthy to suffer as the tempter?</p>
               <p>He leaned panting against the taffrail. His predominant feeling was that he had
                  been ensnared. His judgment had been drugged, and he had been lured on to evil. An
                  infamous conspiracy!</p>
               <p>His breath regained, he stood upright and in a mechanical manner arranged his
                  disordered dress. His haversack was gone,—had been torn from his shoulders and
                  carried overboard. An awkward loss! for it contained, among other things, valuable
                  letters and papers given him by his father; not to mention a notebook of his own,
                  and Uncle Glyphic's miniature. His dead enemy had carried off the proofs of his
                  murderer's identity!</p>
               <p>Not till now did Helwyse become aware of an unusual tumult on the steamer. Had
                  they seen the deed?—He stood with set teeth, one hand on the taffrail. Rather than
                  be taken alive, he would leap over!<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6660-00000058"/> But
                  it soon became evident that the nucleus of excitement was elsewhere. The "Empire
                  State" was at a stand-still. Captain and mates were shouting to one another and at
                  the sailors. By the flying light of the lanterns Helwyse caught glimpses of the
                  sails and tall masts of a schooner. He began to comprehend what had happened.</p>
               <p>"Thank God! that saves me," he said with a sense of relaxation. Then he turned and
                  peered fearfully into the black abyss beyond the stern. Nothing there! nothing
                  save the heavy breathing of remorseless waves.</p>
               <p>The statistics of things God has been thanked for,—what piquant instances would
                  such a collection afford! Any unusual stir of emotion seems to impel a reference
                  to something higher than the world. Only a bloodless calm appears to be secure
                  from God's interference. It is worthy of remark that this was the first time in
                  Helwyse's career—at least since his arrival at years of discretion—that he had
                  thanked God for anything. This was not owing to his being of a specially
                  ungrateful disposition, but to peculiar ideas upon the subject of a Supreme Being.
                  God, he believed, was no more than the highest phase of man; and in any man of
                  sufficient natural endowment, he saw a possible God: just as every American
                  citizen is a possible President! What is of moment at present, however, is the
                  fact that the young man's first inconsistency of word with creed dates at the time
                  his self-control forsook him on board the midnight steamer.</p>
               <p>In that thanksgiving prayer his passion passed away. After unnaturally distending
                  every sense and faculty, it suddenly ebbed, leaving the consciousness of an
                  irritating vacuum. Something must be done to fill it. One drawback to crime seems
                  to be its insufficiency to itself. It creates a craving which needs must be fed.
                  The demon returns, demanding a fresh task; and he returns again forever!</p>
               <p>Helwyse, therefore, plunged into the midst of the uproar consequent on the
                  collision, and tried to absorb the common excitement,—to identify himself with
                  other men; no longer to be apart from them and above them. But he did not succeed.
                  It seemed as though he would never feel excitement or warmth in the blood again!
                  His deed was a dead weight that steadied him spite of his best efforts. His aim
                  has hitherto been, not to forget himself;—let him forget himself now if he
                  can!</p>
               <p>The uproar was over all too soon, and the steamer once more under way.</p>
               <p>"No serious harm done, sir!—no harm done!" observed a spruce steward.</p>
               <p>"No; no harm."</p>
               <p>"By the way, sir,—thought I heard some one sing out aft just afore we struck. You
                  heard it, sir? Thought some fellow'd gone overboard, may be!"</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6660-00000059"/>
               <p>"I saw no one," answered Helwyse; nor had he. But he turned away, fearing that the
                  brisk steward might read prevarication in his face. No, he had seen no one; but he
                  had heard a plunge! He revolted from the memory of it, but it would not be
                  banished. Had there been a soul in the body before it made that dive? even for a
                  few minutes afterwards? He would have given much to know! In theorizing about
                  crime, he had always maintained the motive to be all in all. But now, though
                  unable to controvert the logic of his assertion, he felt it told less than the
                  whole truth. He recognized a divine conservative virtue in straws, and grasped at
                  the smallest! Through the long torture of self-questioning and indecision, let us
                  not follow him. Uncertainty is a ghastly element in such a matter.</p>
               <p>He groped his way back to the taffrail. Why, he knew not; but there he was at
                  last. He might safely soliloquize now; there was no listener. He might light a
                  cigar and smoke; no one would see him. Yet, no; for, on second thoughts, his
                  cigars had gone with the haversack!</p>
               <p>He bent over the slender iron railing. Where was—it now? Miles away by this time,
                  swinging, swaying down—down—down to the bottom of the Sound! Slowly turning over
                  as it sinks, its arms now thrown out, now doubled underneath; the legs sprawling
                  helplessly lessly; the head wagging loosely on the dead neck. Down—down, pitching
                  slowly head forwards; righting, and going down standing, the hair floating
                  straight on end. Down! O, would it never be done sinking—sinking—sinking? Was the
                  sea deep as Hell?</p>
               <p>But when it reached the bottom, would it rest there? No, not even there. It would
                  drift uneasily about for a while on the dark sand, the green gloom of the water
                  above it. Every hour it would grow less and less heavy; by and by it would begin
                  slowly to rise—rise! Horrible it looked now; not like itself, that had been
                  horrible enough before. Rising,—rising. O fearful thing! why come to tell dead
                  men's tales here? You are done with the world. What wants mankind with you?
                  Begone! sink, and rise no more! It will not sink; still it rises, and the green
                  gloom lightens as it slowly buoys upwards. The light rests shrinkingly on it,
                  revealing the dreadful features. The limbs are no longer pliant, but
                  stiff,—terribly stiff and unyielding. Still it rises, nearer and nearer to the
                  surface. See where the throat was gripped! Up it comes at last in the morning sun,
                  among the sparkling, laughing, pure blue waves,—the swollen, dead thing!—dead in
                  the midst of the world's life, hideous amidst the world's beauty. It bobs and
                  floats, and will sink no more; would rise to heaven if it could! No need for that.
                  The tide takes it and creeps stealthily with it towards<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000060"/> the shore, and casts it, with shudder and recoil,
                  upon the beach. There it lies.</p>
               <p>Such visions haunted Helwyse as he leaned over the taffrail. He had not suspected,
                  at starting, upon how long a voyage he was bound. How many hours might it be since
                  he and the cook had so merrily dined together? Was such a contrast possible?
                  Surely no more monstrous delusion than this of Time ever imposed upon mankind! For
                  months and years he jogs on with us, a dull and sober-paced pedestrian. Then comes
                  a sudden eternity! But Time thrusts a clock in our faces, and shows us that the
                  hands have marked a minute only. Shall we put faith in him?</p>
               <p>Helwyse suffered from a vivid imagination. He went not to his room that night. He
                  kept the deck, and tried to talk with the men, following them about and asking
                  aimless questions, until they began to give him short answers. Where were his
                  pride and his serene superiority to the friendship or enmity of his race? where
                  his philosophic self-criticism and fanciful badinage? his resolute, conquering
                  eyes? his bearing of graceful, careless authority? Had all these attributes been
                  packed in his haversack, and cast with that upon the waters? and would they, no
                  more than he to whose care they had been intrusted, ever return?</p>
               <p>With each new hour, morning seemed farther off. In his objectless wanderings,
                  Helwyse came to the well of the engine-room and hung over it, gazing at the
                  bright, swift-sliding machinery, studying the parts, tracing the subtle
                  transmission of force from piece to piece. Here at last was companionship for him!
                  The engine was a beautiful combination,—so polished, effective, and logical; like
                  the minds of some philosophers, moving with superhuman regularity and power, but
                  lifeless!</p>
               <p>Helwyse watched it long, till finally its monotony wearied him. It was doing
                  admirable work, but it never swerved from its course at the call of sentiment or
                  emotion. Its travesty of life was repulsive. Machinery is the most admirable
                  invention of man, but is modelled after no heavenly prototype, and will have no
                  part in the millennium. It seems to annul space and time, yet gives us no taste of
                  eternity. Man lives quicker by it, but not more. With another kind of weapon must
                  the true victory over matter be achieved!</p>

               <head>XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">MORE VAGARIES.</head>
               <p>MOST benign and beautiful was the morning. The "Empire State" emerged from the fog
                  and left it, a rosy cloud, astern. The chasing waves sparkled and danced for joy.
                  The sun was up, fresh and unstained as yesterday. Night, that had changed so much,
                  had left the sun undimmed. With the same power and brightness as for innumerable
                  past centuries, his glorious glance colored the gray sky blue. Helwyse—he was at
                  the stern taffrail again—looked at the marvellous sphere with unwinking eyes,
                  until it blurred and swam before him, and danced in colored rings. It warmed his
                  face, but penetrated no deeper. Looking away, black suns moved everywhere before
                  his eyes, and the earth looked dim and shabby, as though blighted by a curse.</p>
               <p>Helwyse had not slept, partly from disinclination to the solitude of his berth,
                  partly because the thought of awakening dismayed him. Nevertheless, he could
                  scarcely believe in what had happened, now. He stood upon the very spot; here was
                  the semicircle of railing, the camp-stools, the white cabin-wall against which he
                  had leaned. But the blackness of night had so utterly past away that it seemed as
                  though the deed done in it must in some manner have vanished likewise. What is
                  fact at one time looks unreal at another. It must be associated with all times and
                  moods before it can be fully comprehended and accepted.</p>
               <p>Glancing down at the deck, Helwyse saw there the cigar he had been smoking the
                  night before, flattened out by the tread of a foot, and lying close beside it a
                  sparkling ring. He picked it up; it was a diamond of purest water, curiously
                  caught between the mouths of two little serpents, whose golden and black bodies,
                  twisted round each other, formed the hoop. Realizing, after a moment, from whose
                  finger it must have fallen, he had an impulse to fling it far into the sea; but
                  his second thought was not to part from it. The idea of its former owner must
                  indeed always be hateful to his murderer; but the bond between their souls was
                  closer and more indissoluble than that between man and wife; and of so unnatural a
                  union this ring was a fair emblem. Unnatural though the union were, to Helwyse it
                  seemed at the time better than total solitude.</p>
               <p>He felt heavy and inelastic,—averse to himself, but still more to society. He
                  wished to see men and women, yet not to be seen of them. He had used to be ready
                  in speech, and willing to listen; now, no subject<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000062"/> ject interested him save one,—on which his lips
                  must be forever closed. When the sun had made himself thoroughly at home on earth
                  and in heaven, Helwyse went to his state-room, feeling unclean from the soul
                  outwards. While making his toilet, he took care to leave the window-blind up, that
                  he might at any time see the blue sky and water, and the bright shore, with its
                  foliage and occasional houses. He shrank from severing, even for an instant, his
                  communication with the beneficent spirit of nature. And yet Nature could not
                  comfort him,—in his extremest need he found her most barren. He had been wont to
                  rejoice in her as the creature of his own senses; but when he asked her to
                  sympathize with his pain, she laughed at him,—the magnificent coquette!—and bade
                  him, since she was only the reflection of himself, be content with his own
                  sympathy. Truly, if man and Nature be thus allied, and God be but man developed,
                  then is self-sufficiency the only virtue worth cultivating, and idolatry must
                  begin at home!</p>
               <p>His efforts to improve his appearance were not satisfactory; the loss of his
                  toilet articles embarrassed him not a little; and he, moreover, lacked zest to
                  enter into the business with his customary care. And what he did was done not
                  merely for his own satisfaction, as heretofore, but with an eye to the criticisms
                  of other people. His naively unconscious independence had got a blow. After doing
                  his best he went out, pale and heavy-eyed, the diamond ring on his finger.</p>
               <p>The passengers had begun to assemble in the cabin. It seemed to Helwyse, as he
                  entered, that one and all turned and stared at him with suspicious curiosity. He
                  half expected to see an accuser rise up and point a dreadful finger at him. But in
                  truth the sensation he created was no more than common; it was his morbid
                  sensitiveness, which for the first time took note of it. He had been accustomed to
                  look at himself as at a third person, in whose faults or successes he was alike
                  interested; but although his present mental attitude might have moved him to
                  smile, he, in fact, felt no such impulse. The hue of his deed had permeated all
                  possible forms of himself, thus barring him from any standpoint whence to see its
                  humorous aspect. The sun would not shine on it!</p>
               <p>As time passed on, however, and no one offered to denounce him, Helwyse began to
                  be more at ease. Seeing the steward with whom he had spoken the night before, he
                  asked him whereabouts he supposed the schooner was.</p>
               <p>"O, she'll be in by night, sir, safe enough. Wind's freshened up a good bit since;
                  wouldn't take her long to rig a new bowsprit. Beg pardon, sir, did you happen to
                  know the party next door to you?"</p>
               <p>"I know no one. What about him?"</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6660-00000063"/>
               <p>"Can't find him nowhere, sir. Door locked this morning; hadn't used his bed; must
                  have come aboard, for there was a violin lying on the bed in a black box, for all
                  the world like a coffin, sir. Queer, ain't it?"</p>
               <p>The steward was called away, but Helwyse's uneasiness had returned. Did this
                  fellow suspect nothing? The student of men could not read his face; the power of
                  insight seemed to have left him. Reason could tell him that it was impossible he
                  should be suspected, but reason no longer satisfied him.</p>
               <p>He left the cabin and once more sought the deck, harried and anxious. Why could
                  not he be stolid and indifferent, as were many worse criminals than he? Or was his
                  disquiet a gauge of his moral accountability? By as much as he was more finely
                  gifted than other men, was the stain of sin upon his soul more ineffaceable? Last
                  night, ignorance was the only evil; but had he been satisfied with less wisdom,
                  might he not have sinned with more impunity? Nevertheless, Balder Helwyse would
                  hardly have been willing to purchase greater ease at the price of being less a
                  man.</p>
               <p>The steamer descended the narrow and swift current of East River, rounded Castle
                  Garden, and reached her pier before eight o'clock. Shoulder to shoulder with the
                  other passengers, Helwyse descended the gang-plank. The official who took his
                  ticket eyed him so closely that there was the beginning of an impulse in his weary
                  brain to knock the fellow down. Finding himself not interfered with, however, he
                  passed on to the rattling street, beginning to understand that the attention he
                  excited was not owing to a visible brand of Cain, but to his beard and hair, which
                  were at variance with the fashion of that day. He was neither more nor less a
                  cynosure than at other times. But he was more sensitive to notice, and it now
                  occurred to him that his unique appearance was unsafe as well as irksome. Were a
                  certain body found, in connection with evidence more or less circumstantial, how
                  readily might he be pointed out! He fancied himself reading the description in a
                  newspaper, and realized how many and how easily noted were his peculiarities. His
                  carelessness of public remark had been folly. The sooner his peculiarities were
                  amended, the better!</p>
               <p>At the corner of the street stood a couple of policemen,—ponderous, powerful men,
                  able between them to carry to jail the most refractory criminal. One path was open
                  to Helwyse, whereby to recover his self-respect, and regain his true footing with
                  the world; and that led into the hands of those policemen! With a revulsion of
                  feeling perhaps less strange than it seems, he walked up to them, resolved to
                  surrender himself on a charge of murder. It was the simplest issue to his
                  embarrassments.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6660-00000064"/>
               <p>"Policemen!" he began, with a return of his assured voice and bearing. They stared
                  at him, and one said, "How?"</p>
               <p>"Direct me to the best hotel near here!" said Helwyse.</p>
               <p>They stared, and told him the way to the Astor House.</p>
               <p>There had been but the briefest hesitation in Helwyse's mind, but during that
                  pause he had reconsidered his resolve and said No to it. Remembering some episodes
                  of his past history, he cannot hastily be accused of vulgar fear of death. In his
                  case, indeed, it may have required more courage to close his mouth than to open
                  it. Be that as it might, the question as to the degree and nature of his guilt was
                  still unsettled in his mind. Moreover, had he been clear on this point, he yet
                  distrusted the competence of human laws to do him justice. He shrank from
                  surrender, less as affecting his person than as superseding his judgment. But,
                  failing himself and mankind, to what other court can he appeal? Should the fitting
                  tribunal appear, will he have the nerve to face it?</p>
               <p>He did not go to the Astor House, notwithstanding the trouble he had taken to ask
                  his way thither. He coasted along the more obscure thoroughfares, seeming to find
                  something congenial in them. Here were people, many of whom had also committed
                  crimes, whose eyes he need not shun to meet, who were his brethren. To be sure,
                  they gave him no friendly glances, taking him for some dainty aristocrat, whom
                  idle curiosity had led to their domains. But Helwyse knew the secret of his
                  kinship; and he perhaps indulged a wild momentary dream of proclaiming himself to
                  them, entering into their life, and vanishing from that world that had known him
                  heretofore. It is a shorter step than is generally supposed, from human height to
                  human degradation.</p>
               <p>A pale girl with handsome features, careless expression, and somewhat disordered
                  hair, leant out of a low window, her loose dress falling partly open from her
                  bosom as she did so.</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, my love?" inquired she, with a professionally attractive
                  smile. "Aren't you going to give me a lock of that sweet yellow hair?—there's a
                  duck!"</p>
               <p>It so happened that Helwyse had never before been openly accosted by a member of
                  this class of the community. Was this infringement of the rule the result of his
                  own fall, or of the girl's exceptional effrontery? He had an indignant glance
                  ready poised, but forbore to hurl it! The worst crime of the young woman was that
                  she disposed of herself at a rate of remuneration exactly corresponding to the
                  value of the commodity; whereas he, less economical and orderly, had mortgaged<pb
                     n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6660-00000065"/> his own soul by disposing of some one
                  else's body, and was, if anything, out of pocket by the transaction! Undoubtedly
                  the young woman had the best of it; very likely, had she been aware of the
                  circumstances, she would not have deigned him so much as a smile. He therefore
                  neither yielded to her solicitations nor rebuked them, but passed on. The
                  adventure rectified his fraternizing impulse. Albeit standing accountant for so
                  great a sin, the mire was as yet alien to him.</p>
               <p>But there was pertinence in the young woman's question; where was he going,
                  indeed? Since the catastrophe on board the steamer, he had forgotten Doctor
                  Glyphic. He felt small inclination to meet his relative now; but certain
                  considerations of personal interest no longer wore the same color as yesterday.
                  Robbed of his self-respect, he could ill afford to surrender worldly wealth into
                  the bargain. On the other hand, to palm himself off on his uncle for a true man
                  was adding hypocrisy to his other crime.</p>
               <p>Such an objection, however, could hardly have turned the scale. Great crimes are
                  magnets of smaller ones. It was necessary for Helwyse to alter the whole scheme of
                  his life-voyage; and since he had failed in beating up against the wind, why not
                  make all sail before it? Meanwhile, it was easier to call on Doctor Glyphic than
                  to devise a new course of action; and thus, had matters been allowed to take their
                  natural turn, mere inertia might have brought about their meeting.</p>
               <p>But the irony of events turns our sternest resolves to ridicule. On the next
                  street-corner was a hair-dresser's shop, its genial little proprietor, plump and
                  smug, rubbing his hands and smiling in the doorway. Beholding the commanding
                  figure of the yellow-bearded young aristocrat, afar off, his professional mouth
                  watered over him. What a harvest for shears and razor was here! Dare he hope that
                  to him would be intrusted the glorious task of reaping it?</p>
               <p>As Helwyse gained the corner, his weary eyes took in the smiling hair-dresser, the
                  little room beyond cheerful with sunshine and colored paper-hangings, and the
                  padded chair for customers to recline in. Here might he rest awhile, and rise up a
                  new man,—a stranger to himself and to all who had known him. It was fitting that
                  the inward change should take effect without; not to mention that the wearing of
                  so conspicuous a mane was as unsafe as it was unsuitable.</p>
               <p>He entered the shop, therefore,—the proprietor backing and bowing before him,—and
                  sat down with a sigh in the padded chair. Immediately he was enveloped in a light
                  linen robe, a towel was tucked in round his neck by deft caressing fingers, the
                  soothing murmur of a voice was in his ear, and presently<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000066"/> sounded the click-click of shears. The descendant
                  of the Vikings closed his eyes and felt comfortable.</p>
               <p>The peculiar color and luxuriance of Balder's hair and beard were marked
                  attributes of the Helwyse line. In these days of ponderous genealogies, who would
                  be surprised to learn that the family sprang from that Balder, surnamed the
                  Beautiful, who was the sun-god of Scandinavian mythology? Certain of his
                  distinctive characteristics, both physical and mental, would appear to have been
                  perpetuated with marvellous distinctness throughout the descent; above all, the
                  golden locks, the blue eyes, and the sunny disposition.</p>
               <p>For the rest, so far as sober history can trace them back, they seem to have been
                  a noble and adventurous race of men, loving the sea, but often taking a high part
                  in the political affairs of the nation. The sons were uniformly fair, but the
                  daughters dark,—owing, it was said, to the first mother of the line having been a
                  dark-eyed woman. But the advent of a dark-eyed heir had been foretold from the
                  earliest times, not without ominous (albeit obscure) hints as to the part he would
                  play in the family history. The precise wording of none of these old prophecies
                  has come down to us; but they seem in general to have intimated that the dark-eyed
                  Helwyse would bring the race to a ruinous and disgraceful end, saving on the
                  accomplishment of conditions too improbable to deserve serve recording. The dead
                  must return to life, the living forsake their identity, love unite the blood of
                  the victim to that of the destroyer,—and other yet stranger things must happen
                  before the danger could be averted.</p>
               <p>The superstitious reverence paid to enigmatical utterances of this kind has long
                  ago passed away; and, if any meaning ever attaches to them, it is apt to be sadly
                  commonplace. Nevertheless, when Balder was born, and the hereditary blue eyes were
                  found wanting, the circumstance was doubtless the occasion of much half-serious
                  banter among those to whom the ominous prophecies were familiar. Certainly the
                  young man had already made one grave mistake; and he could hardly have followed it
                  up by a more disgraceful retreat than this to the hair-dresser's saloon. The
                  ghosts of his heroic forefathers in Valhalla would disown his shorn head with
                  indignant scorn; for their golden locks had ever been sacred to them as their
                  honor. When the Roman Empire was invaded by the Goths and Vandals, a Helwyse—so
                  runs the tale—was taken prisoner and brought before the Roman General. The latter
                  summoned a barber and a headsman, and informed the captive that he might choose
                  between forfeiting his head, and that which grew upon it. As to the precise words
                  in which the Northern warrior couched his reply, historians vary; but they<pb
                     n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6660-00000067"/> are agreed on the important point that
                  his head was chopped off without delay!</p>
               <p>Did the memory of these things bring no blush to Balder's cheeks? There he sat, as
                  indifferent, to all outward seeming, as though he were asleep. But this may have
                  been the apathy consequent on the abandonment of lofty pretensions and sublime
                  ambitions; betraying proud sensitiveness rather than base lack of feeling. Balder
                  Helwyse was not the first man of parts to appear in an undignified and unheroic
                  light. The foremost man of all this world once whined like a sick girl for his
                  physic, and preposterously overestimated his swimming powers; yet his greatness
                  found him out!</p>
               <p>In sober earnest, however, what real importance attaches to Helwyse's doings at
                  this juncture? Physically and mentally weary, he may have acted from the most
                  ordinary motives. As to his entertaining any superstitious crotchets about having
                  his hair cut,—the spirit of the age forbid it!</p>

               <head type="sub">THROUGH A GLASS.</head>
               <p>THE hair-dresser had the quality—now rare among his class—of unlimited and
                  self-enjoying loquacity; soothing, because its little waves lapsed in objectless
                  prattle on the beach of the apprehension, to be attended to or not at pleasure.
                  The sentences were without regular head or tail, and were connected by a friendly
                  arrangement between themselves, rather than by any logical sequence; while the
                  recurring pauses at interesting epochs of work wrought a recognition of how
                  caressing had been the easy voice, and accumulated a lazy disposition to hear it
                  continue.</p>
               <p>After decking Helwyse for the sacrifice, he had murmured confidentially in his
                  ear, "Hair, sir?—or beard, sir?—or both?—little of both, sir? Just so. Hair first,
                  please, sir. Love-ly morning!"</p>
               <p>And thereupon began to clip and coo and whisk softly about, in the highest state
                  of barberic joy. As he worked, inspired by the curly, flowing glossy locks which,
                  to his eye, called inarticulately for the<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6660-00000068"
                  /> tools of his trade, his undulating monologue welled forth until Coleridge might
                  have envied him. Helwyse heard the sound, but let the words go by to that unknown
                  limbo whither all sounds, good or bad, have been flying since time began.</p>
               <p>By and by the hair was done; there ensued a plying of brushes, a blowing down the
                  neck, and a shaking out of the linen apron.</p>
               <p>"Will you cast your eyes on the mirror now, sir, please?"</p>
               <p>"No,—go on and finish, first," replied Helwyse; and forthwith a cushion was
                  insinuated beneath his head, and his feet were elevated upon a rest. He heard the
                  preparation of the warm lather, and anon the knowing strapping of a razor. He put
                  up his hand and stroked his beard for the last time, wondering how he would look
                  without it.</p>
               <p>"Never saw the like before, sir; must have annoyed you dreadful!" remarked the
                  commiserating barber, as he passed the preparatory scissors round his customer's
                  jaw, mowing the great golden sheaf at one sweep. He spoke of it as though it were
                  a cancer or other painful excrescence, the removal of which would be to the
                  sufferer a boon unspeakable.</p>
               <p>Helwyse's face expressed neither anguish nor relief; he presently lost himself in
                  thoughts of his own, only returning to the perception of outside things when the
                  barber asked him whether he, also, had ever attended camp-meeting; the subject
                  being evidently one which had been held forth upon for some time past.</p>
               <p>"No?" continued the little man, who by long practice had acquired a wonderful
                  power of interpreting silence. "Well, it's a great thing, sir; and a right curious
                  thing is experiencing religion, too! A great blessing I've found it, sir; there's
                  a peace dwells with me, as the minister says, right along all the time now. Does
                  the razor please you, sir? Ah! I was a wild and godless being once, although
                  always reckoned a smart hand with the razor;—Satan never took my cunning hand, as
                  the poet says, away from me. Yes, there was a time when I was how-d' y'-do with
                  all the bloods around the place, and a good business I used to do out of them,
                  too, sir; but religion is a peace there's no understanding, as the Good Book says;
                  and if I don't make all I used to, I save twice as much,—and that's the good of
                  it, sir. Beau-ti-ful chin is yours, sir, I declare!"</p>
               <p>"Do you believe in the orthodox faith?" demanded Helwyse; "in miracles, and the
                  Trinity, and so forth?"</p>
               <p>"Everything we're told to believe in I believe, I hope, sir; and as quick as I
                  hear anything more, why, I'm ready to believe that also, provided only it comes
                  through orthodox channels, as the saying is.<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000069"/> Ah, sir, it's the unquestioning belief that brings
                  the happiness. I wouldn't have anything explained to me, not if I could! and my
                  faith is such, that what goes against it I never would believe, not if you proved
                  it to me black and white, sir! Love-ly skin you 've got, sir,—it's just like a
                  woman's. The intellect is a snare, that's what it is,—ah, yes! You think with me,
                  sir, don't you?"</p>
               <p>But Helwyse had relapsed into silence. The little hair-dresser was happy, was
                  he?—happy, and hopeful, and conscious of spiritual progress?—had no misgivings and
                  feared no danger,—because he had eliminated reason from his scheme of religion!
                  Divine reason,—could man live without it? A snare?—Well, had not Balder found it
                  so?</p>
               <p>True, that was not reason's fault, but his who misused reason. True, also, that he
                  who believed on others' authority believed not ideas but men, and was destitute of
                  self-reliance or dignity. Yet the hair-dresser seemed to find in that very
                  dependence his best happiness, and to have built up a factitious self-respect from
                  the very ruin of true dignity. His position was the antipodes of Balder's, yet, if
                  results were evidence, it was tenable and more successful.</p>
               <p>This plump, superficial, smiling little hair-dresser was a person of no
                  importance, yet it happened to him to modify not only Helwyse's external aspect,
                  but the aspect of his mind as well,—by the presentation of a new idea; for,
                  strange to say, Helwyse had never chanced to doubt that seraphim were higher than
                  cherubim, or that independence was the only ladder to heaven. To be taught by one
                  avowedly without intellect is humiliating; but the experience of many will furnish
                  examples of a singular disregard of this kind of proprieties.</p>
               <p>When the shaving was done to the artist's satisfaction, he held the mirror before
                  his customer's face. Helwyse looked narrowly at his reflection, as was natural in
                  making the acquaintance of one who was to be his near and intimate companion. He
                  beheld a set of features strongly yet gracefully built, but shorn of a certain
                  warm, manly attractiveness. The immediate visibility of mouth and chin—index of so
                  large a part of man's nature—startled him. He was dismayed at the ease wherewith
                  the working of emotion might now be traced. Man wholly unveiled to himself is
                  indeed an awful spectacle, be the dissection-room that of the surgeon or of the
                  psychologist. Hardly might angels themselves endure it. A measure of ignorance of
                  ourselves is wise, because consciousness of a weakness may lead us to give it
                  rein. Perfect strength can coexist only with perfect knowledge, but neither is
                  attainable by man. Man should pray to be screened from himself, lest his sword<pb
                     n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6660-00000070"/> fail,—lest the Gorgon's head on his
                  breast change him to stone.</p>
               <p>The gracious, outflowering veil of Balder Helwyse's life had vanished, leaving
                  nakedness. Henceforth he must depend on fence, feint and guard, not on the
                  downright sword-stroke. With Adam, the fig-leaf succeeded innocence as a garment;
                  for Helwyse, artificial address must do duty as a fig-leaf. The day of guiltless
                  sincerity was past; gone likewise the day of open acknowledgment of guilt. Now
                  dawned the day of counterfeiting,—not always the shortest of our mortal year.</p>
               <p>On the whole, Helwyse's new face pleased him not. He felt self-estranged and
                  self-distrustful. Standing on the borders of a darker land, the thoughts and deeds
                  of his past life swarmed in review before his eyes. Many a seeming trifling event
                  now showed as the forewarning of harm to come. The day's journey once over, we see
                  its issue prophesied in each trumpery raven and cloud that we have met since
                  morning. However, the omens would have read as well another way; for nature, like
                  man, is twofold, and can be as glibly quoted to Satan's advantage as to God's.</p>
               <p>"Very well done!" said Helwyse to the barber, passing a hand over the
                  close-cropped head and polished chin. "The only trouble is, it cannot be done once
                  for all."</p>
               <p>As the little man smilingly remarked, however, the charge was but ten cents. His
                  customer paid it and went out, and was seen by the hair-dresser to walk listlessly
                  up the street. The improvement in his personal appearance had not mended his
                  spirits. Indeed, it cannot be disguised that his trouble was more serious than lay
                  within a barber's skill altogether to set right.</p>
               <p>Were man potentially omniscient, then might Balder's late deed be no crime, but a
                  simple exercise of prerogative. But is knowledge of evil real knowledge? God is
                  goodness and man is evil. God knows both good and evil. Man knows evil—knows
                  himself—only; knows God only in so far as he ceases to be man and admits God. But
                  this simple truth becomes confused if we fancy a possible God in man.</p>
               <p>This was Balder's difficulty. Possessed of a strong, comprehensive mind, he had
                  made a providence of himself; confounded intelligence with integrity; used the
                  moral principle not as a law of action but as a means of insight. The temptation
                  so to do is strong in proportion as the mind is greatly gifted. But experience
                  shows no good results from yielding to it. Blind moral instinct, if not safer, is
                  more comfortable!</p>
               <p>Not the deed alone, but the revelation it brought, preyed on the young man's
                  peace. If he were a criminal to-day, then was the whole argument of his past<pb
                     n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6660-00000071"/> life criminal likewise. Yesterday's
                  deed was the logical outcome of a course of thought extending over many
                  yesterdays. Why, then, had not his present gloom impended also, and warned him
                  beforehand? Because, while parleying with the Devil, he looks angelic; but having
                  given our soft-spoken interlocutor house-room, he makes up for lost time by
                  becoming direfully sincere!</p>
               <p>On first facing the world in his new guise, Helwyse felt an embarrassment which he
                  fancied everybody must remark. But, in fact (as he was not long discovering), he
                  was no longer remarkable; the barber had wiped out his individuality. It was what
                  he had wished, and yet his insignificance annoyed him. The stare of the world had
                  put him out of countenance; yet when it stopped staring he was still unsatisfied.
                  What can be the solution of this paradox?</p>
               <p>It perhaps was the occasion of his seeking the upper part of the city, where
                  houses were more scarce and there were fewer people to be unconcerned! In country
                  solitudes he could still be the chief figure. He entered Broadway at the point
                  where Grace Church stands, and passed on through the sparsely inhabited region now
                  known as Union Square. The streets hereabouts were but roughly marked out, and
                  were left in many places to the imagination. On the corner of Twenty-third Street
                  was a low white washed inn, whose spreading roof overshadowed the girdling
                  balcony. Farmers' wagons were housed beneath the adjoining shed, and one was drawn
                  up before the door, its driver conversing with a personage in shirt-sleeves and
                  straw hat, answering to the name of Corporal Thompson.</p>
               <p>Helwyse perhaps stopped at the Corporal's hospitable little establishment to rest
                  himself and get some breakfast; but whether or not, his walk did not end here, but
                  continued up Broadway, and after passing a large kitchen-garden (whose owner, a
                  stout Dutchman, was pacing its central path, smoking a long clay pipe which he
                  took from his lips only to growl guttural orders to the gardeners who were
                  stooping here and there over the beds), emerged into open country, where only an
                  occasional Irish shanty broke the solitude.</p>
               <p>How long the young man walked he never knew; but at length, from the summit of a
                  low hill, he looked northwest and saw the gleam of Hudson River. Leaving the road
                  he struck across rocky fields which finally brought him to the river-bank. A stony
                  promontory jutted into the water, and on this (having clambered to its outer
                  extremity) Helwyse sat down, his feet overhanging the swirling current. The tide
                  was just past the flood.</p>
               <p>About two hundred yards up stream, to the northward, stood a small wooden house,
                  on the beach in front of which a shabby old mariner was bailing out<pb n="142-143"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000072"/> his boat. Southwards, some miles away, curved the
                  shadowed edge of the city, a spire mounting here and there, a pencilled mist of
                  smoke from chimneys, a fringe of thready masts around the farthest point. In front
                  slid ceaselessly away the vast sweep of levelled water, and still it came
                  undiminished on. The opposing shore was a mile distant, its rocky front gradually
                  gaining abruptness and height until lost round the northern curve. But directly
                  opposite Helwyse's promontory, the stony wall was for some way especially
                  precipitous and high, its lofty brink serried with a thick phalanx of trees.</p>
               <p>This spot finally monopolized the adventurer's attention; had he been in Germany,
                  he would have looked for gray castle-towers rising behind the foliage. The place
                  looked inaccessible and romantic, and was undeniably picturesque. New York was far
                  enough away to be mistaken for—say—Alexandria; while the broad river certainly
                  took its rise in as prehistoric an age as the Nile itself. Perhaps in the early
                  morning of the world some chieftain built his stronghold there, and fought notable
                  battles and gave mighty feasts; and later married, and begat stalwart sons, or a
                  daughter beautiful as earth and sky! Where to-day were her youth and beauty, her
                  loving noble heart, her warm melodious voice, her eyes full of dark light? Why
                  were there no such women now?—not warped, imperfect fect, only half alive in body
                  and spirit; but charged from the heart outwards with pure divine vitality,—natures
                  vivid as fire, yet by strength serene!</p>
               <p>"Why did not I live when she lived, to marry her?" muttered Helwyse in a dream. "A
                  woman whose infinite variety age could not alter nor custom stale! A true wife
                  would have kept me from error. What man can comprehend the world, if he puts half
                  the world away? Now it is too late; she might have helped me rise to greatness,
                  but not to bear disgrace. Ah, Balder Helwyse, poor fool! you babble as if she
                  stood before you to take or leave. <emph>You</emph> rise to greatness? You never
                  had the germs of greatness in you! You are so little that not the goddess Freya
                  herself could have made you tall! Through what delusion did you fancy yourself
                  better than any other worm?"</p>
               <p>There was an interval, not more than a rod or two in width, in the tree-hedge
                  which lined the opposite cliff. Through this one might get a narrow glimpse of
                  what lay beyond. A strip of grassy lawn extended in front of what seemed to be the
                  stone corner of a house. The distance obscured detail, but it looked massively
                  built, though not after the modern style. As Helwyse gazed, sharpening his eyes to
                  discern more clearly, he saw a figure moving across the lawn directly towards him.
                  Advancing to the brink of the cliff, it there paused and<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000073"/> seemed to return his glance. Helwyse could not tell
                  whether it were man or woman. Had the river only been narrower!</p>
               <p>The next moment he remembered his telescope, and, taking it from its case, he was
                  at a bound within one hundred yards of the western shore. Man or woman? he
                  steadied the glass on his knee and looked again. A woman, surely,—but how
                  strangely dressed! Such a costume had not been in vogue since Damascus was a new
                  name in men's mouths. Balder gazed and gazed. Accurately to distinguish the
                  features was impossible,—tantalizingly so; for the gazer was convinced that she
                  was both young and beautiful. Her motions, her bearing, the graceful peculiarity
                  of her garb,—a hundred nameless evidences made it sure. How delightful to watch
                  her in her unconsciousness! yet Helwyse felt a delicacy in thus stealing on her
                  without her knowledge or consent. But the misgiving was not strong enough to shut
                  up his telescope; perhaps it added a zest to the enjoyment.</p>
               <p>"The very princess you were just now dreaming of! the most beautiful and complete
                  woman! Would I were the prince to win thee!"</p>
               <p>This aspiration was whispered, as though its object were within conversable
                  distance. Balder could be imaginative enough when the humor took him.</p>
               <p>Hardly had the whisper passed his lips when he saw the princess majestically turn
                  her lovely head, slowly and heedfully, until her glance seemed directly to meet
                  his own. His cheeks burned; it was as if she had actually overheard him. Was she
                  gracious or offended? He saw her stretch towards him her arms, and then, with a
                  gesture of beautiful power, clasp her hands and draw them in to her bosom.</p>
               <p>Prince Balder's hand trembled, the telescope slipped; the quick effort to regain
                  it lent it an impetus that shot it far into the water. It had done its work and
                  was gone forever. The beautiful princess was once more a vague speck across a mile
                  of rapid river; now, even the speck had moved beyond the trees and was out of
                  sight!</p>
               <p>The episode had come so unexpectedly, and so quickly passed, that now it seemed
                  never to have been at all! But Helwyse had yielded himself unreservedly to the
                  influence of the moment. Following so aptly the fanciful creation of his thought,
                  the apparition had acquired peculiar significance. The abrupt disappearance
                  afflicted him like a positive loss.</p>
               <p>Did he, then, soberly believe himself and the princess to have exchanged glances
                  (not to speak of thoughts) across a river a mile wide? Perhaps he merely courted a
                  fancy from which the test of reason was deliberately withheld. Spirits not being
                  amenable to material laws, what was the odds (so far as exchange<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000074"/> change of spiritual sentiment was concerned)
                  whether the prince and princess were separated by miles or inches?</p>
               <p>But however plausible the fancy, it was over. Helwyse leaned back on the rock,
                  drew his hat over his eyes, folded his hands beneath his head, and appeared to
                  sleep.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE TOWER OF BABEL.</head>
               <p>IN a perfect state of society, where people will think and act in harmony with
                  only the purest æsthetic laws, a knowledge of stenography and photography will
                  suffice for the creation of perfect works of art. But until that epoch comes, the
                  artist must be content to do the grouping, toning, and proportioning of his
                  picture for himself, under penalty of redundancy and confusion. People nowadays
                  seldom do or think the right thing at the fitting moment; insomuch that the
                  biographer, if he would be intelligible, must use his own discretion in arranging
                  his materials.</p>
               <p>Now, in view of the rough shaking which late events had given Balder and his
                  opinions, it is doing no violence to probability to fancy him taking an early
                  opportunity to pass these opinions in review. It would be easy, by a glance at the
                  magic ring, to reproduce his meditations just as they passed through his brain.
                  Brevity and pertinence, however, counsel us to recall a dialogue which had taken
                  place about three years before.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6660-00000075"/>
               <p>Balder and his father were then in the North of England; and the latter (who never
                  concerned himself with any save the plainest and most practical philosophy) was
                  not a little startled at an analogy drawn by his son between the cloud-cap on
                  Helvellyn's head and the Almighty! Premising that the cloud-cap though apparently
                  stable, was really created by the continuous passage of warmer air through a cold
                  region around the summit of the mountain, whereby it was for a moment condensed
                  into visibility and then swept on,—having postulated this fact, and disregarding
                  the elder's remark that he believed not a word of it,—Balder went on to say that
                  God was only a set of attributes,—in a word, the perfection of all human
                  attributes,—and not at all an individual!</p>
               <p>"And what has that to do with your cloud-making theory?" demanded Thor, with
                  scorn.</p>
               <p>"The perfect human attributes," replied Balder, unruffled, "correspond to the
                  region of condensation,—the cold place, you understand."</p>
               <p>"Do they? Well?"</p>
               <p>"The constant condensation of the warm current from below corresponds to the
                  taking on of these attributes by a ceaseless succession of human souls. Filling
                  out the Divine character, they lose identity, and so make room for others."</p>
               <p>"What are these attributes?"</p>
               <p>"They are ineffable,—they are omniscience,—the comprehension of the whole creative
                  idea."</p>
               <p>"You expect me to believe that,—eh?" growled Thor.</p>
               <p>"If I could believe you understood it, dear old sceptic!" returned Balder, with
                  affectionate irreverence, throwing his arm across his father's broad shoulders. "I
                  say that every soul of right capacity, living for culture, and not afraid of
                  itself, will at last reach that highest point. It is the sublime goal of man, and
                  no human life is complete unless in gaining it. Many fail, but not all. I will
                  not! No, I am not blasphemous; I think life without definite aim not worth having;
                  and that aim, the highest conceivable."</p>
               <p>Thor, having stared in silence at his descendant, came out with a stentorian
                  Viking laugh, which Balder sustained with perfect good-humor.</p>
               <p>"Ho, ho!—the devil is in you, son!—in those black eyes of yours,—ho, ho! No other
                  Helwyse ever had such eyes,—or such ideas either! Well, but supposing you passed
                  the condensation point, what then?"</p>
               <p>Balder, who was entirely in earnest about the matter, answered gravely,—</p>
               <p>"I cease to be; but what was I becomes the pure, life-giving, spiritual substance,
                  and enters into fresh personalities, and so passes up again in endless
                  circulation."</p>

               <p>"Hum! and how with the evil ones, boy?"</p>
               <p>"As with all waste matter; they are cast aside, and, as distinct souls, are
                  gradually annihilated. But they may still manure the soil, and involuntarily help
                  the growth of others. Sooner or later, in one or another form, all come into
                  use."</p>
               <p>"For all I see, then," quoth Thor, "your devils come to the same end as your
                  gods!"</p>
               <p>"There is the same kind of difference," returned the philosopher, "as between
                  light and earth,—both of which help the growth of flowers; but light gives color
                  and beauty, earth only the insipid matter. I would rather be the light."</p>
               <p>"Another thing," proceeded Thor, ignoring this distinction; "admitting all else,
                  how do you account for your region of condensation?"</p>
               <p>"By the necessity of perfection," answered Balder, after some consideration.
                  "There would be no meaning in existence unless it tended towards perfection. But
                  you have hit on the unanswerable question."</p>
               <p>Thor shook his head and huge grizzled beard. "German University humbug!" growled
                  he. "Get you into a scrape some day. The cloud's not made in that way, I tell you!
                  Come, let's go back to the inn."</p>
               <p>"Take my arm," said Balder; and as together they descended the spur of the
                  mountain, he added lovingly, "I'll bring no clouds across your sky, my dear old
                  man!" So the hospitable inn received them.</p>
               <p>The discussion between the two was never renewed; but Balder held to his creed. He
                  elaborated and fortified what had been mere outline before. No dogma can be
                  conceived which many circumstances will not seem to confirm and justify. But we
                  cannot attempt to keep abreast of Balder's deductions. There are as many
                  theological systems as individual souls; and no system can be wholly apprehended
                  by any one save its author.</p>
               <p>Mastery of men and things,—supreme knowledge to the end of supreme power,—such
                  seems to have been his ambition,—an ambition too abstract and lofty for much
                  rivalry. Nature and human nature were at once his laboratory and his instruments.
                  His senses were to him outlets of divinity. The good and evil of such a scheme
                  scarce need pointing out. It was the apotheosis of self-respect; but self-respect
                  raised to such a height becomes self-worship; human vision dazzles at the
                  sublimity of the prospect; at the moment of greatest weakness the soul arrogates
                  invincible power, and falls! For, the mightier man is, the more absolutely does he
                  need the support of a mightier Man than he can ever be.</p>
               <p>No doubt Balder had often been assailed by doubts and weariness; the path had
                  seemed too long and<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6660-00000077"/> arduous, and he had
                  secretly pined for some swift issue from perplexity and delay. In such a moment
                  was it that the voice of darkness gained his ear, and, like a will-o'-the-wisp,
                  lured him to calamity. Verily, it is not easy to be God. Only builders of the
                  Tower of Babel know the awfulness of its overthrow.</p>
               <p>Balder's spirit lay prostrate among the ruins, too stunned and bewildered to see
                  the reason or justice of his fall. Such a state is dangerous, for, the better part
                  of the mind being either occupied with its disaster or stupefied by it, the
                  superficial part is readily moved to folly or extravagance,—to deeds and thoughts
                  which a saner moment would scout and ridicule. Well is it, then, if the blind
                  steps are guided to better foothold than they know how to choose. Angels are said
                  to be particularly watchful over those who sleep; perhaps, also, during the
                  darkness which follows on moral perversion.</p>

               <head type="sub">CHARON'S FERRY.</head>
               <p>AFTER lying motionless for half an hour, Balder suddenly sat upright and settled
                  his hat on his head. A new purpose had come to him which, arriving later than it
                  might have done, made him wish to act upon it without delay.</p>
               <p>The old mariner had by this time bailed out his boat, and, having shipped a mast
                  in the forward thwart, was dropping down stream. As he neared the promontory
                  Balder hailed him:—</p>
               <p>"Hullo! skipper, take me across?"</p>
               <p>The skipper, without replying, steered shorewards, the other clambering down the
                  rock to meet him. After a brief parley, during which the old fellow closely
                  scrutinized his intending passenger from head to foot, a bargain was struck, and
                  they put forth, tacking diagonally across stream. For Balder, having charged his
                  imagination with castles, warlike chieftains, and beautiful princesses, had
                  finally arrived at the conclusion that the stone house was an enchanter's castle;
                  the figure he had seen, an imprisoned lady;<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000078"/> himself, a knight-errant bound to rescue her and
                  give the wicked enchanter his deserts. This idea possessed his brain for the
                  moment more vividly than do realities most men. The plumed helmet was on his head,
                  he glittered with shining arms and sword, his heart warmed and throbbed with
                  visions of conflict and bold emprise. The commonplace assumed an aspect of
                  grandeur and magnificence in harmony with his chivalric mania. The leaky craft in
                  which he sat became a majestic barge; the skipper, some wrinkled Charon who
                  doubtless had ferried many a brave knight to his death beneath yonder castle's
                  walls. That seeming birch-stump on the farther shore was the castle champion,
                  armed cap-a-pie in silver harness and ready with drawn sword to do battle against
                  all comers. Trim the sail, ferryman, and steer thy skilfullest!</p>
               <p>The kind of insanity which sees in outward manifestation the fantasies of the mind
                  is an affection incident at times to every one. An artist sees beauties in a
                  landscape, an artisan in pulleys and levers, and either may be so far insane in
                  the eyes of the other. Nature discovers grandeur, beauty, or truth according as
                  the quality abides in the seer. In this view Balder or Don Quixote was no more
                  insane than other people. Their eyes bore true witness to what was in their minds,
                  and the sanest eyes can do no more. Their minds were, perhaps, out of focus; but
                  who can cast the first stone?</p>
               <p>The skipper, when not masquerading as Charon, was a lean, brown, and wrinkled old
                  salt, neither complete nor clean of garb, and bulging as to one lank cheek with a
                  quid of tobacco. At first he sat silent, dividing his attention between the
                  conduct of his boat and his passenger.</p>
               <p>"Whereabouts will yer land, Captain?" he asked when they were fairly under
                  way.</p>
               <p>"Wherever there is a path upwards. Who is the owner of the castle?"</p>
               <p>"The castle? Well, there ain't many rightly knows just what his name is," answered
                  Charon, cocking his gray eye rather quizzically. "Some says one thing, some
                  another. I have heard tell he was Davy Jones himself!"</p>
               <p>"Have you ever seen him?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know; I've seen something that might have been him; but there's no
                  telling! he can fix himself up to look like pretty much anything, they say. There
                  ain't many calls up to the castle, anyway."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Well, there's a big wall all around the place, for one thing, and never a gate in
                  it; so without yer dives under ground and up again, there don't seem no easy way
                  of getting in."</p>
               <p>"Does the owner never come out, then?"</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6660-00000079"/>
               <p>"Well, he can get out, I expect, when he wants to," replied the wrinkled humorist,
                  with a weather-beaten grin. "They do say he whips off on a broomstick about once a
                  month and steers for Bos-ton!" His fashion of utterance was a leisurely sing-song,
                  like the roll of a vessel anchored in a ground-swell.</p>
               <p>"Why does he go there?" demanded Prince Balder, with the air of finding nothing
                  extravagant or improbable in the sailor's yarn. The latter (a little doubting
                  whether his interlocutor were a simpleton or a "deep one") answered, after a
                  moment's pause,—to replenish his imagination perhaps,—</p>
               <p>"Well, in course, I knows nothing what he does; but they do say he coasts around
                  to all the hotels and overhauls the log. He's been laying for some one this twenty
                  year. My idea, it's about time he hailed him!"</p>
               <p>"What does he want with him?"</p>
               <p>"Well, yer see, what folks say is, this chap had played some game or other off on
                  Davy; so Davy he puts a rod in pickle and vows he'd be even with the chap,
                  yet.</p>
               <p>"Yer see,—I'll tell yer," continued Charon, leaning forward on his knee and
                  speaking confidentially; "just as this chap was putting off,—with some of Davy's
                  belongings, likely,—Davy up and cuts a slice of flesh and blood off him. Well, he
                  takes this slice and fixes it up one way or another, and makes a witch out of
                  it,—handsome as she can be,—enough to draw a chap's heart right out through his
                  jacket. Now, being as she's his own flesh and blood, d'yer see, this chap I'm
                  telling yer on's bound to come back after her afore he dies. Well, soon as Davy
                  gets hold on him, he ups with him to the place yonder and outs with the witch.
                  'Here yer are, my dear friend!' says he (as civil as may be), 'here's yer own
                  flesh and blood a-waiting for yer!' Well, the chap grabs for her, and once he
                  touches her there ain't no letting go no more. Off she starts on her broomstick,
                  he along behind, till they gets over Hell gate—" Charon checked himself, made an
                  ominous downward gesture with his right forefinger, and emphasized it by spitting
                  solemnly to leeward.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever meet him,—this man?" asked Helwyse, rousing himself from a brown
                  study and looking Charon in the eyes.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, I couldn't tell for certain as I ever met him," replied the other,
                  returning the look with an odd wrinkling of the features. "But it's nigh on twenty
                  year that I fetched a man across this very spot, and back again in the evening,
                  that might have been him. Leastways, he was the last caller ever I took over to
                  that house."</p>
               <p>"I am the first since he—eh?"</p>
               <p>"Well, yer are; and, Captain,—no offence to you,—<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000080"/> but allowing for a lot of hair he had, he was like
                  enough to you to be yer twin brother!"</p>
               <p>"Or even myself! So Davy Jones goes by the name of Doctor Glyphic in these parts,
                  does he?" said Balder, with a sudden, incisive smile, which almost cut through the
                  old ferryman's self-possession. The boat at the same moment glided into a little
                  cove, and the passenger jumped ashore. Charon stood deferentially touching his
                  weather-stained hat, too much mystified to speak. But the fare which Helwyse
                  handed him restored his voice.</p>
               <p>"Thank yer, Captain,—thank yer kindly!—hope no offence, Captain,—a chap picks up a
                  deal of gossip in twenty year, and—"</p>
               <p>"No offence in the world!" cried Helwyse; "I take you for a powerful enchanter,
                  who seems to steer one way, when he is in fact taking his passenger in another.
                  Where are you bound?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I was dropping down a bit to see if the schooner ain't around yet. She'd
                  ought to be in by now, if nothing ain't runned into her in the fog."</p>
               <p>Helwyse paused a moment, eying Charon sharply. "The schooner 'Resurrection,'" he
                  began, and, seeing he had hit the mark, continued, "was run into last night on
                  Long Island Sound, and had her bowsprit carried away. But no serious damage was
                  done, and she'll be in by night, if the wind holds."</p>
               <p>With this he bade the awe-stricken old yarn-spinner farewell, and, with secret
                  laughter at his bewilderment, turned to the narrow zigzag path that climbed the
                  bank, passing the birch-stump champion without a glance of recognition. A few
                  vigorous minutes brought him to the summit, whence, facing round, he saw the broad
                  river crawl beneath him; the little boat, with Charon in the stern, drift
                  downwards; and beyond, the whole rough length of Manhattan Island.</p>
               <p>A few days before Thor Helwyse's departure for Europe (some four years after his
                  wife's death) he had left a certain little boy and girl in charge of the nurse,—a
                  woman in whose faithfulness he placed the utmost confidence,—and had crossed from
                  Brooklyn to New Jersey, to say good by to Brother Hiero. Returning at night he
                  found one of the children—his son Balder—locked up in the nursery; the nurse and
                  the little girl had disappeared, nor did Thor again set eyes on either of
                  them.</p>
               <p>Balder, as he grew up, often questioned his father concerning various events which
                  had happened beyond the reach of his childish memory; and among other stories, no
                  doubt this of the farewell visit to Uncle Glyphic had been often told with all the
                  details. By no miracle, therefore, but simply by an acute mental process,
                  associating together time, place, and description, was Balder enabled so to
                  dumfounder old Charon.</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6660-00000081"/>
               <p>Embarking on a phantom quest, his brain full of whimsical visions, Balder had thus
                  unexpectedly stepped into the path of his legitimate affair. The accident (for no
                  better reason than that it was such) inspired him with a superficial cheerfulness.
                  He had landed some distance below his uncle Glyphic's house,—for such indeed it
                  was,—and he now took his way towards it through trees and underbrush. It was so
                  situated, and so thickly surrounded with foliage, as to be visible from no point
                  in the vicinity. Had the site been chosen with a view to concealment, the builder
                  could not have succeeded better. Remembering the eccentricity of his uncle's
                  character, as portrayed in many an anecdote, Balder would not have been surprised
                  to find him living under ground, or in a pyramid.</p>
               <p>On arriving at the wall whereof the ferryman had told him, he found it a truly
                  formidable affair, some twelve feet high and built of brick. To scale it without a
                  ladder was impossible; but Balder, never doubting that there was a gate somewhere,
                  set out in search of it.</p>
               <p>It was tiresome walking over the uneven ground and through obstructing bushes,
                  branches, and stumps. The tall brick barrier seemed as interminable as unbroken.
                  How many houses, thought Balder, might have been built from the material thus
                  wasted! If ever he came into possession of the place, he resolved to present the
                  brick to his friend Charon, that he might replace his wooden shanty with something
                  more durable and convenient, and perhaps build a dock for the schooner
                  "Resurrection" to lie in. It must have taken a fortune to put up such a wall; were
                  the enclosure proportionally valuable, it was worth while crossing the ocean to
                  see it. Still more wall! fully a mile of it already, and yet further it rambled on
                  through leafy thickets. But no signs of a gate!</p>
               <p>"I believe the Devil really does live here!" exclaimed Balder, in impatient heat;
                  "and the only way in or out is on a broomstick,—or by diving under ground, as
                  Charon said!"</p>
               <p>Stumbling onwards a while farther, he suddenly came again upon the river-bank,
                  having skirted the whole length of the wall. There was actually no getting in! The
                  castle was impregnable.</p>
               <p>Helwyse sat down at the foot of a birch-tree which grew a few yards from the
                  wall.</p>
               <p>"How does my uncle manage about his butcher and baker, I wonder! He might at least
                  have provided a derrick for victualling his stronghold. Perhaps he hauls up
                  provisions by ropes over the face of the cliff. No doubt, Charon knew about it.
                  Shall I go down and look?"</p>
               <p>It was provoking—having come so far to call on a relative—to be put off with a
                  mile or two of brick<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6660-00000082"/> wall. The gate
                  must have been walled up since his father's time, for Thor had never mentioned any
                  deficiency in that respect. But Balder's determination was piqued,—not to mention
                  his curiosity. Had the path from Mr. MacGentle's office to Doctor Glyphic's door
                  been straight and unobstructed, the young man might have wandered aside and never
                  reached the end. As it was, he was goaded into the resolution to see his uncle at
                  all hazards. An additional spur was the thought of the gracious apparition which
                  he had seen—or dreamt he saw—from the farther bank. Was she indeed but an
                  apparition?—or the single reality amidst the throng of fantasies evoked by his
                  overwrought mind?—beaconing him through misty errors to a fate better than he
                  knew!. In all seriousness, who could she be? Had Doctor Glyphic crowned his
                  eccentricities by marrying, and begetting a daughter?</p>
               <p>These speculations were interrupted by the clear, joyous note of a bird, just
                  above Balder's head. It was such a note as might have been uttered by a
                  paradisical cuckoo with the breath of a brighter world in his throat. Looking up,
                  he saw a beautiful little fowl perched on the topmost twig of the birch-tree. It
                  had a slender bill, and on its head a crest of splendid feathers, which it set up
                  at Balder in a most coquettish manner. The next moment it flew over the wall, and
                  from the farther side warbled an invitation to follow.</p>
               <p>Although he could not fly, Balder reflected that he could climb, and that the top
                  of the tree would show him more than he could see now. The birch looked tolerably
                  climbable and was amply high; as to toughness, he thought not about it. Beneath
                  what frivolous disguises does destiny mask her approach! Discretion is a virtue;
                  yet, had Balder been discreet enough to examine the tree before getting into it,
                  the ultimate consequences are incalculable!</p>
               <p>As it was (and marvelling why he had not thought of doing it before) he set
                  stoutly to work, and, despite his jack-boots, was soon among the upper branches.
                  The birch trembled and groaned unheeded. The bird (an Egyptian bird,—a
                  hoopoe,—descendant of a pair brought by Doctor Glyphic from the Nile a quarter of
                  a century ago),—the hoopoe was fluttering and warbling and setting its brilliant
                  cap at the young man more captivatingly than ever. A glance over the enclosure
                  showed a beautifully fertile and luxurious expanse, damasked with soft green grass
                  and studded with flowers and trees. A few hundred yards away billowed the white
                  tops of an apple-orchard in full bloom. Southward, half seen through boughs and
                  leaves, rose an anomalous structure of brick, glass, and stone, which could only
                  be the famous house on whose design and decoration old Hiero Glyphic had spent
                  years and fortunes.</p>
               <p>The tract was like an oasis in a forbidding land.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6660-00000083"/>
               <p>The soil had none of the sandy and clayey consistency peculiar to New Jersey, but
                  was deep and rich as an English valley. The sunshine rested more warmly and
                  mellowly here than elsewhere. The southern breeze acquired a tropical flavor in
                  loitering across it. The hoopoe had seemed out of place on the hither side the
                  wall, but now looked as much at home as though the Hudson had been the Nile
                  indeed.</p>
               <p>"My uncle," said Balder to himself, as he swayed among the branches of his
                  birch-tree, "has really succeeded very well in transporting a piece of Egypt to
                  America. Were I on the other side of the wall, no doubt I might appreciate it
                  also!"</p>
               <p>The hoopoe responded encouragingly, the tree cracked, and Balder felt with dismay
                  that it was tottering beneath him. There was no time to climb down again. With a
                  dismal croak, the faithless birch leaned slowly through the air. There was nothing
                  to be done but to go with it; and Balder, even as he descended, was able to
                  imagine how absurd he must appear. The tree fell, but was intercepted at half its
                  height by the top of the wall. The upper half of the stem, with its human fruit
                  still attached to it, bent bow-like towards the earth, the trunk not being quite
                  separated from the root.</p>
               <p>Helwyse had thus far managed to keep his presence of mind, and now, glancing
                  downwards, he saw the ground not eight feet below. He loosed his hold, and the
                  next instant stood in the soft grass. The birch had been his broomstick. Meanwhile
                  the hoopoe, with a triumphant note, flew off towards the house to tell the
                  news.</p>

               <head type="sub">LEGEND AND CHRONICLE.</head>
               <p>HIERO GLYPHIC'S house came not into the world complete at a birth, but was the
                  result of an irregular growth, progressing through many years. Originally a
                  single-gabled edifice, its only peculiarity had been that it was brick instead of
                  wooden. Here, red and unornamented as the house itself, the future Egyptologist
                  was born. The parallel between him and his dwelling was maintained more or less
                  closely to the end.</p>
               <p>He was the first pledge of affection between his mother and father, and the last
                  also; for shortly after his advent the latter parent, a retired undertaker by
                  profession, failed from this world. The widow was much younger than her husband,
                  and handsome to boot. Nevertheless, several years passed before she married again.
                  Her second lord was likewise elderly, but differed from the first in being
                  enormously wealthy. The issue of this union was a daughter, the Helen of our
                  story, a pretty, dark-eyed little thing, petted and indulged by all the family,
                  and reigning undisputed over all.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the old brick house had been deserted, Mrs. Glyphic having accompanied
                  her second husband to his sumptuous residence in Brooklyn. But in process of time
                  Hiero (or, as he was then called, Henry) took it into his head to return to the
                  original family mansion and live there. No objection was made; in truth, Henry's
                  oddities, awkwardnesses, and propensity to dabble in queer branches of research
                  and experiment may have allayed the parting pangs. Back he blundered, therefore,
                  to the banks of the Hudson, and established himself in his birthplace. What he did
                  there during the next few years will never be known. Grisly stories about the man
                  in the brick house were current among the country people. A devil was said to be
                  his familiar friend; nay, it was whispered that he himself was the arch-fiend! But
                  nothing positively supernatural, or even unholy, was ever proved to have taken
                  place. The recluse had the command of as much money as he could spend, and no
                  doubt he wrought with it miracles beyond the vulgar comprehension. His mind had no
                  more real depth than a looking-glass with a crack in it, and its images were
                  disjointed and confused. There are many such men, but few possess unlimited means
                  of carrying their crack-brained fancies into fact.</p>
               <p>During this—which may be called the second—period of Glyphic's career, he made
                  several anomalous<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6660-00000085"/> additions to the
                  brick house, all after designs of his own. He moreover furnished it anew
                  throughout, in a manner that made the upholsterers stare. Each room—so reads the
                  legend—was fitted up in the style of a different country, according to Glyphic's
                  notion of it! He was said to live in one apartment or another according as it was
                  his whim to be Spaniard, Turk, Russian, Hindoo, or Chinaman. He also applied
                  himself to gardening, and enclosed seven hundred acres of ground adjoining the
                  house with a picket-fence, forerunner of the famous brick wall. The whole tract
                  was dug out and manured to the depth of many feet, till it was by far the most
                  fertile spot in the State. The larger trees were not disturbed, but the lesser
                  were forced to give place to new and rare importations from foreign countries.
                  Gorgeous were the hosts of flowers, like banks of sunset clouds; the lawns showed
                  the finest turf out of England; there was a kitchen-garden rich and big enough to
                  feed an army of epicures all their lives. In short, the place was a concentrated
                  extract of the world at large, where one might at the same moment be a recluse and
                  a cosmopolitan. Here might one live independent of the world, yet sipping the
                  cream thereof; and might persuade himself that all beyond these seven hundred
                  enchanted acres was but a diffused reflection of the concrete existence between
                  the cliff and the fence.</p>
               <p>But to this second period succeeded finally the third,—that which witnessed the
                  birth and growth of the Egyptian mania. Its natal moment has not been precisely
                  determined; perhaps it was a gradual accretion. Mr. Glyphic's relatives in
                  Brooklyn were one day electrified by the news that the quondam Henry—now
                  Hiero—purposed instant departure for Europe and Egypt. Before starting, however,
                  he built the brick wall round his estate, shutting it out forever from human eyes.
                  Then he vanished, and for nine years was seen no more.</p>
               <p>His return was heralded by the arrival at the port of New York of a mountain of
                  freight, described in the invoice as the property of Doctor Hiero Glyphic of New
                  Jersey. The boxes, as they stood piled together on the wharf, might have furnished
                  timber sufficient to build a town. They contained the fruits of Doctor Glyphic's
                  antiquarian researches.</p>
               <p>The Doctor himself—where he picked up his learned title is unknown—was accompanied
                  by a slender, swarthy young factotum who answered to the name of Manetho. He was
                  introduced to the Brooklyn relatives as the pupil, assistant, and adopted son of
                  Hiero Glyphic. The latter, physically broadened, browned, and thickened by his
                  travels, was intellectually the same good-natured, fussy, flighty original as
                  ever; shallow, enthusiastic, incoherent, energetic.</p>
               <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6660-00000086"/>
               <p>He and his adopted son shut themselves up behind the brick wall; but it soon
                  transpired that extensive additions were making to the old house. Beyond this
                  elementary fact conjecture had the field to itself. Both architects and builders
                  were imported from another State and sworn to secrecy, while the high wall and the
                  hedge of trees baffled prying eyes. Quantities of red granite and many blocks of
                  precious marbles were understood to be using in the work. The opinion gained that
                  such an Oriental palace was building as never had been seen outside an Arabian
                  fairy-tale.</p>
               <p>By and by the work was done, the workmen disappeared. But whoever hoped that now
                  the mystery would be revealed, and the Oriental palace be made the scene of a
                  gorgeous house-warming, was disappointed. The dwellers behind the wall emerged not
                  from their seclusion, nor were others invited to relieve it. In due course of time
                  Doctor Glyphic's worthy step-father died The widow and her daughter continued to
                  live in Brooklyn until the former's death, which took place a few years
                  afterwards. Then Helen came to her brother, and the Brooklyn house was put under
                  lock and key, and so remained till Helen's marriage, when it was set in order for
                  the bridal pair. But Thor's wife died as they were on the point of moving thither,
                  and he sold it four years later and left America forever.</p>
               <p>After his departure less was known than before of how things went on behind the
                  brick wall. The gate way was filled in with masonry. No one was ever seen entering
                  the enclosure or leaving it; though it was supposed that, somehow or other,
                  communication was occasionally had with the outside world. As knowledge dwindled,
                  legend grew, and wild were the tales told of the invisible Doctor and his
                  foster-son. In his youth, the former had been suspected of simple witch-craft, but
                  he was not let off so easily now. Manetho was first dubbed a genie whom the Doctor
                  had brought out of Egypt. Afterwards it was hinted that these two worthies were in
                  fact one and the same demon, who by some infernal jugglery was able to appear
                  twain during the daytime, but resumed his proper shape at night, and cut up all
                  manner of unholy capers.</p>
               <p>By another version, Doctor Glyphic died in Egypt, not before bargaining with the
                  Prince of Darkness that his body should return home in charge of a condemned soul
                  under the guise of Manetho. During the day, affirmed these theorists, the body was
                  inspired by the soul with phantom life; but became a mummy at night, when the
                  condemned soul suffered torments till morning. With sunrise the ghastly drama
                  began anew. This state of things must continue until the sun shone all night long
                  within the brick wall enclosure.</p>
               <p>A third, more moderate account is that to which we have already listened from
                  Charon's lips. And he perhaps<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6660-00000087"/> haps
                  built on a broader basis of truth than did the other yarn-spinners. But under
                  whatever form the legend appeared, there was always mingled with it a vaguely
                  mysterious whisper relating to the alleged presence in the Doctor's Den (so the
                  enclosure was nicknamed) of an apparition in female form. What or whence she was
                  no one pretended soberly to conjecture. Even her personal aspect was the subject
                  of vehement dispute; some maintaining her to be of more than human beauty, while
                  others swore by their heads that she was so hideous fire would not burn her! These
                  damned her for a malignant witch; those upheld her as a heavenly angel, urged by
                  love divine to expiate, through voluntary suffering, the nameless crimes of the
                  demoniac Doctor. But unless the redemption were effected within a certain time,
                  she must be swallowed up with him in common destruction. Were the how and
                  wherefore of these alternatives called in question, the answer was a wise shake of
                  the head!</p>
               <p>The gentle reader will believe no one of the fantastic legends here recorded;
                  possibly they were not believed by their very fabricators. They are useful only as
                  tending to show the moral atmosphere of the house and its occupants. There is
                  sometimes a subtile symbolic element inwoven with such tales, which—though not the
                  truth—helps us to apprehend the truth when we come to know it. Moreover, the
                  fanciful parts of history are to the facts as clouds to a landscape; a picture is
                  incomplete without them; they aid in bringing out the distances, and cast lights
                  and shadows over tracts else harsh and bare.</p>
               <p>Beyond what he had gathered from the ancient mariner, Balder Helwyse knew nothing
                  of these fearful fables. This perhaps accounted for the boldness wherewith he
                  pursued his way towards the mysterious house, following in the airy wake of the
                  clear-throated little hoopoe.</p>

               <head>XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">FACE TO FACE.</head>
               <p>THE ground-plan of the house was like a capital H placed endwise towards the
                  river. The northern side consisted of the original brick building and the
                  additions of the second period; the southern was that stone edifice which so few
                  persons had been lucky enough to see. The centre or cross-piece comprised the
                  grand entrance-hall and staircase, heavily panelled with dark oak, and the floor
                  flagged with squares of black and white marbles.</p>
               <p>This entrance-hall opened eastward into a generous conservatory, filling the whole
                  square court between the wings at that end. The corresponding western court was
                  devoted to the roomy portico. Two or three broad steps mounted to a balcony twenty
                  feet deep and nearly twice as wide, protected by a lofty roof supported on slender
                  Moorish columns. Crossing this, one came to the hall-door, likewise Moorish in
                  arch and ornamentation. Considered room by room and part by part, the house was
                  good and often beautiful; taken as a whole, it was the craziest amalgamation
                  mation of incongruities ever conceived by human brain.</p>
               <p>Balder, approaching from the north, trod enjoyingly the silken grass. No misgiving
                  had he; his uncle would hardly be from home, nor would he be apt to discredit his
                  nephew's identity. His face had already been evidence to more than one former
                  knower of his father, and why not also to his uncle?</p>
               <p>The house was more than half a mile in a direct line from the birch-tree, and
                  presented an imposing appearance; but on drawing near, the odd architectural
                  discrepancies became noticeable. Side by side with the prosy Americanism of the
                  northern wing, sprang gracefully the Moorish columns of the portico; beyond,
                  uprose in massive granite, quaintly inscribed and carved, and strengthened by
                  heavy pilasters, the ponderous Egyptian features of the southern portion. The
                  latter was neither storied nor windowed, and, as Balder conjectured, probably
                  contained but a single vast room, lighted from within.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile there were no signs of an inhabitant, either in the house or out of it.
                  It wore in parts an air of emptiness and neglect, not exactly as though gone to
                  seed, but as if little human love and care had been expended there. The deep-set
                  windows of the brick wing, like the sunken eyes of an old woman, peered at the
                  visitor with dusky forlornness. Lonely<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6660-00000089"/>
                  and stern on the other side stood the Egyptian pilasters, as though unused to the
                  eye of man; the hieroglyphics along the cornice intensified the impression of
                  desertion. As the young man set foot beneath the portico, he laid a hand on one of
                  the slender pillars, to assure himself that it was real, and not a vision. Cool,
                  solid marble met his grasp; the building did not vanish in a peal of thunder, with
                  an echo of demoniac laughter. Yes, all was real!</p>
               <p>But the stillness was impressive, and Balder struck the pillar sharply with his
                  palm, merely for the sake of hearing a noise. There was no answering sound, so,
                  after a moment's hesitation, he walked to the door,—which stood ajar,—purposing to
                  call in the aid of bell and knocker. Neither of these civilized appliances was to
                  be found. While debating whether to use his voice or to enter and use his eyes,
                  the note of the hoopoe fell on his ear. An instant after came an answering note,
                  deeper, sweeter, and stronger,—it thrilled to Balder's heart, bringing to his
                  mind, by some subtile process, the goddess of the cliff.</p>
               <p>He crossed the oak-panelled hall (where the essence of mediæval England lingered)
                  and came to the threshold of the conservatory. It was a scene confusedly
                  beautiful. The air, as it touched his face, was tropically warm and indolent with
                  voluptuous fragrance of flowers and plants. Luxuriant shrubs, with broad-drooping
                  drooping leaves, stood motionless in the heat. Two palm-trees uplifted their heavy
                  plumes forty feet aloft, on slender stalks, brushing the high glass roof. In the
                  midst of the conservatory a pool slumbered between rocky margins, overgrown with a
                  profusion of reeds, grasses, and water-plants. There floated the giant leaves and
                  blossoms of the tropic water-lily; and on a fragment of rock rising above the
                  surface dozed a small crocodile, not more than four feet long, but looking as old,
                  dried up, and coldly cruel as sin itself!</p>
               <p>The place looked like an Indian jungle, and Balder half expected to see the
                  glancing spots of a tiger crouching beneath the overarching leaves; or a naked
                  savage with bow and arrows. But amid all this vegetable luxuriance appeared no
                  human being,—no animal save the evil crocodile. Whence, then, that melodious
                  voice,—clear essence of nature's sweetest utterances?</p>
               <p>At the left of the conservatory was a door, the entrance to the Egyptian temple.
                  It was square and heavy-browed, flanked by short thick columns rising from a base
                  of sculptured papyrus-leaves, and flowering in lotus capitals. Three marble steps
                  led to the threshold, while on either side reclined a sphinx in polished granite,
                  softened, however, by a delicate flowering vine, which had been trained to cling
                  round their<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6660-00000090"/> necks. On the deep panels
                  of the door were mystic emblems carved in relief. A line of hieroglyphics
                  inscribed the lintel in deep blue, red, and black,—to what purport Balder could
                  not divine.</p>
               <p>At the opposite side of the conservatory was a corresponding door, veiled by an
                  ample fold of silken tapestry, cunningly hand-worked in representation of a moon
                  half veiled in clouds, shining athwart a stormy sea. By her light a laboring ship
                  was warned off the rocks to leeward. The room (one of the later additions) by its
                  external promise might have been the bower of some fashionable beauty thousands of
                  years ago.</p>
               <p>Balder looked from one of these doors to the other, doubting at which to apply.
                  The tapestry curtain was swept aside at the base, leaving a small passage clear to
                  the room beyond. In this opening now appeared the bright-crested head and eyes of
                  the hoopoe, peeping mischievously at the intruder, who forthwith stepped down into
                  the conservatory, holding forth to the little bird a friendly finger. The bird
                  eyed him critically, then launched itself on the air, and, alighting on a spray
                  above his head, warbled out a brilliant call.</p>
               <p>Hereupon was heard within a quick rustling movement; the curtain was thrust aside,
                  and a youthful woman issued forth amongst the warm plants. She was within a few
                  feet of Balder Helwyse before seem ing to realize his presence. She caught herself
                  motionless in an instant. The sparkle of laughter in her eyes sank in a black
                  depth of wonder. Her eyes filled themselves with Balder as a lake is filled with
                  sun-shine; and he, the man of the world and philosopher, could only return her
                  gaze in voiceless admiration.</p>
               <p>Were a face and form of primal perfection to appear among men, might not its
                  divine originality repel an ordinary observer, used to consider beautiful such
                  abortions of the Creator's design as sin and degeneration have produced? Not
                  easily can one imagine what a real man or woman would look like. Painting nor
                  sculpture can teach us; we must learn, if at all, from living, electric flesh and
                  blood.</p>
               <p>This young woman was tall and erect with youthful majesty. She stood like the
                  rejoicing upgush of a living fountain. Her contour was subtile with womanly
                  power,—suggesting the spring of the panther, the glide of the serpent. Warm she
                  seemed from the bosom of nature. One felt from her the influence of trees, the
                  calm of meadows, the high freedom of the blue air, the happiness of hills. She
                  might have been the sister of the sun.</p>
               <p>The moulding finger of God seemed freshly to have touched her face. It was simple
                  and harmonious as a chord of music, yet inexhaustible in its variety. It recalled
                  no other face, yet might be seen in it the<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000091"/> germs of a mighty nation, that should begin from
                  her, and among a myriad resemblances evolve no perfect duplicate. No angel's
                  countenance, but warmest human clay, which must undergo some change before
                  reaching heaven. The sphinx, before the gloom of her riddle had dimmed her primal
                  joy,—before men vexed themselves to unravel God's webs from without instead of
                  from within,—might have looked thus; or such perhaps was Isis in the first flush
                  of her divinity,—fresh from Him who made her immortally young and fair.</p>
               <p>Her black hair was crowned with a low, compact turban,—a purple and white twist of
                  some fine cottony substance, striped with gold. Round her wide, low brow fitted a
                  band of jewelled gold, three fingers' breadth, from which at each temple depended
                  a broad, flat chain of woven coral, following the margin of the cheeks and falling
                  loose on the shoulders. A golden serpent coiled round her smooth throat and
                  drooped its head low down in her bosom. Her elastic feet, arched like a dolphin's
                  back, were sandalled; the bright-colored straps, crossing one another half-way to
                  the knee, set dazzlingly off the clear, dusky whiteness of the skin.</p>
               <p>From her shoulders fell a long full robe of purple byssus, over an underdress of
                  white which reached the knee. This tunic was confined at the waist by a
                  hundred-fold girdle, embroidered with rainbow flowers and fastened in a broad knot
                  below the bosom, the low-hanging hanging ends heavy with fringe. The outer robe,
                  with its long drooping sleeves falling open at the elbow, was ample enough wholly
                  to envelop the figure, but was now girded up and one fold brought round and thrust
                  beneath the girdle in front, to give freedom of motion. A rare perfume emanated
                  from her, like the evening breath of orange-blossoms.</p>
               <p>Balder was no unworthy balance to this picture, though his else stately features
                  showed too much the stimulus of modern thought. He was eminent by culture; she by
                  nature only. But Balder's culture had not greatened him. Greatness is not of the
                  brain, save as allied to the deep, pure chords which thrill at the base of the
                  human symphony. He might have stood for our age; she, for that more primitive but
                  profounder era which is at once man's beginning and his goal.</p>
               <p>Balder's eyes could not frankly hold their own against her gaze of awful
                  simplicity. All he had ever done amiss arose and put him to the blush.
                  Nevertheless, he would not admit his inferiority; instead of dropping his eyes he
                  closed the soul behind them, and sharpened them with a shallow, out-striking
                  light. Without understanding the change, she felt it and was troubled. Loftily
                  majestic as were her form and features, she was feminine to the core,—tender and
                  finely perceptive. The incisive masculine gaze abashed her.<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000092"/> She raised one hand deprecatingly, and her lips
                  moved, though without sound.</p>
               <p>He relented at this, and straightway her expression again shifted, and she smiled
                  so radiantly that Balder almost looked to see whence came the light! The wondrous
                  lines of her face curved and softened; all that was grave vanished. A tree
                  standing in the sober beauty of shadow, when suddenly lit by the sun, changes as
                  she changed; for sunshine is the laughter of the world.</p>
               <p>The smile refreshed her courage, for she came nearer and made a sideways movement
                  with her arm, apparently with the expectation that it would pass through the
                  stalwart young man as readily as through the air. On encountering solid substance,
                  she drew startled back, half in alarm and wholly in surprise. Balder had felt her
                  touch, first as a benediction; then it chilled him, through remembrance of a deed
                  forever debarring him from aught so pure and innocent as she. The subtleties of
                  his philosophy might have cajoled him anywhere save in her presence. There, he
                  felt unmistakably guilty; yet from irrational dread that she, whose intuitions
                  seemed so swift and deep, might grasp the cause of his discomposure, he strove to
                  hide it. Last of all the world should she know his crime!</p>
               <p>Scarce two minutes since their meeting, yet perhaps a large proportion of their
                  lives had meanwhile been charmed away. No word had been spoken,—eyes had
                  superseded tongues. Nay, was ordinary conversation possible with a young goddess
                  such as this? So perfect seemed her mastery over those profounder elements of
                  intercourse underlying speech, which are higher and more direct than the mechanism
                  of articulate words, that perhaps the latter method was unknown to her.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, one must say something. But what?—with what sentence of supreme
                  significance should he begin? Moreover, what language should he use? for she,
                  whose look and bearing were so alien to the land and age, might likewise be a
                  stranger to modern dialects. But Aryan or Semitic was not precisely at the tip of
                  Balder's tongue!</p>
               <p>In the midst of his embarrassment, the startling note of the hoopoe pierced his
                  ear, and precipitated him into asking that great elemental question which all
                  created things are forever putting to one another,—</p>
               <p>"What is your name?"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HOOPOE AND THE CROCODILE.</head>
               <p>"GNULEMAH!" she answered, laying a finger on the head of her golden serpent, and
                  uttering the name as though it were of the only woman in the world.</p>
               <p>But the next moment she found time to realize that something unprecedented had
                  occurred, and her wonder trembled on the brink of dismay.</p>
               <p>"Speaks in my language!" she exclaimed below her breath; "but is not Hiero!"</p>
               <p>Until Balder's arrival, then, Hiero would seem to have been the only talking
                  animal she had known. The singularity of this did not at first strike the young
                  man. Gnulemah was the arch-wonder; yet she so fully justified herself as to seem
                  very nature; and by dint of her magic reality, what else had been wonderful seemed
                  natural. Balder was in fairy-land.</p>
               <p>He fell easily into the fairy-land humor.</p>
               <p>"I am a being like yourself," said he, with a smile; "and not dumb like your
                  plants and animals."</p>
               <p>"Understood!—answered!" exclaimed Gnulemah again, in a tremor. As morning spreads
                  up the sky, did the sweet blood flow outward to warm her face and neck. As the
                  blush deepened, her eyelids fell, and she shielded her beautiful embarrassment
                  with her raised hands. A pathos in the simple grace of this action drew tears
                  unawares to Balder's eyes.</p>
               <p>What was in her mind? what might she be? Had she lived always in this enchanted
                  spot, companionless (for poor old Hiero could scarcely serve her turn) and
                  ignorant perhaps that the world held other beings endowed like herself with human
                  gifts? Had she vainly sought throughout nature for some kinship more intimate than
                  nature could yield her, and thus at length fancied herself a unique, independently
                  created soul, imperial over all things? Since her whole world was comprised
                  between the wall and the river, no doubt she believed the reality of things
                  extended no further.</p>
               <p>In Balder she had found a creature like, yet pleasingly unlike herself, palpable
                  to feeling as to sight, and gifted with that articulate utterance which till now
                  she had accounted her almost peculiar faculty. Delightful might be the discovery,
                  but awesome too, frightening her back by its very tendency to draw her
                  forward.</p>
               <p>Whether or not this were the solution of Gnulemah's mystery, Balder recognized
                  quiet to be his cue towards her. Probably he could not do better than to get the
                  ear of Doctor Hiero, and establish himself upon a<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000094"/> footing more conventional than the present one. His
                  next step accordingly was to ask after him by name.</p>
               <p>She peeped at the questioner between her fingers, but ventured not quite to emerge
                  from behind them, as she answered,—her primary attempt at description,—</p>
               <p>"Hiero is—Hiero!"</p>
               <p>"And how long have you been here?" inquired Balder with a smile.</p>
               <p>Gnulemah forgot her embarrassment in wondering how so remarkable a creature
                  happened to ask questions whose answers her whole world knew!</p>
               <p>"We are always here!" she exclaimed; and added, after a moment's doubtful
                  scrutiny, "Are you a spirit?"</p>
               <p>"An embodied spirit,—yes!" answered he, smiling again.</p>
               <p>"One of those I see beyond,"—she pointed towards the cliff,—"that move and seem to
                  live, but are only shadows in the great picture? No! for I cannot touch them nor
                  speak with them; they never answer me; they are shadows." She paused and seemed to
                  struggle with her bewilderment.</p>
               <p>"They are shadows!" repeated Helwyse to himself.</p>
               <p>Though no Hermetic philosopher, he was aware of a symbolic truth in the fanciful
                  dogma. Outside his immediate circle, the world is a shadow to every man; his
                  fellow-beings are no more than apparitions, till he grasps them by the hand. So to
                  Gnulemah the cliff and the garden wall were her limits of real existence. The
                  great picture outside could be true for her only after she had gone forth and felt
                  as well as seen it.</p>
               <p>Fancy aside, however, was not hers a condition morally and mentally deplorable?
                  Exquisitely developed in body, must not her mind have grown rank with
                  weeds,—beautiful perhaps, but poisonous? Herein Balder fancied he could trace the
                  one-sided influence of his crack-brained uncle. Whether his daughter or not,
                  Gnulemah was evidently a victim of his experimental mania. What particular
                  crotchet could he have been humoring in this case? Was it an attempt to get back
                  to the early sense of the human race?</p>
               <p>The materials for such an evolution were certainly of tempting excellence. In
                  point of beauty and apparent natural capacity, Gnulemah might claim equality with
                  the noblest daughter of the Pharaohs. The grand primary problem of how to isolate
                  her from all contact with the outside world was, under the existing circumstances,
                  easy of solution. Beyond this there needed little positive treatment. Her creed
                  must arise from her own instinctive and intuitive impressions. Of all beyond the
                  reach of her hands, she must trust to her eyes alone for information; no marvel<pb
                     n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6660-00000095"/> vel, therefore, if her conclusions
                  concerning the great intangible phenomena of the universe were fantastic as the
                  veriest heathen myths. The self-evolved feelings and impulses of a black-eyed
                  nymph like Gnulemah were not likely to be orthodox. She was probably no better
                  than a worshipper of vain delusions and idols of the imagination.</p>
               <p>Her attire—a style of costume such as might have been the fashion in the days of
                  Cheops or Tuthmosis—showed a carrying out of the Doctor's whim,—a matching of the
                  external to the internal conditions of the age he aimed to reproduce. The project
                  seemed, on the whole, to have been well conceived and consistently prosecuted. It
                  was seldom that Uncle Hiero achieved so harmonious a piece of work; but the idea
                  showed greater moral obliquity than Balder would have looked for in the old
                  gentleman.</p>
               <p>But there was no deep sincerity in the young man's strictures. There before him
                  stood the woman Gnulemah,—purple, white, and gold; a vivid, breathing, warm-hued
                  life; a soul and body rich with Oriental splendor. There she stood, her hair
                  flowing dark and silky from beneath her twisted turban, her eyes,—black melted
                  loadstones; the broad Egyptian pendants gleaming and glowing from temple to
                  shoulder. The golden serpent seemed to writhe on her bosom, informed from its
                  wearer with a subtile vitality. Through all dominated nated a grand repose, like
                  the calm of nature, which storms may prove but not disthrone!</p>
               <p>There she stood,—enchanted princess, witch, goddess,—woman at all events, palpable
                  and undeniable. She must be accepted for what she was, civilized or uncivilized,
                  heathen or Christian. She was a perfected achievement,—vain to argue how she might
                  have been made better. Who says that an evening cloud, gorgeous in purple and
                  heavenly gold, were more usefully employed fertilizing a garden-patch?</p>
               <p>Balder Helwyse, moreover, was not a simple utilitarian; he was almost ready to
                  make a religion of beauty. If he blamed his uncle for shutting up this superb
                  creature within herself, he failed not to admire the result of the imprisonment.
                  He knew he was beholding as rare a spectacle as ever man's eyes were blessed
                  withal; nor was he slow to perceive the psychological interest of the situation.
                  To a student of mankind, if to no one else, Gnulemah was beyond estimation
                  precious. But had Balder forgotten what fruit his tree of philosophy had already
                  yielded him?</p>
               <p>At all events, he forbore to press his question as to the whereabouts of Uncle
                  Hiero, who would turn up sooner or later. It was enough for the present to know
                  that he still existed. Meanwhile he would sound the depths of this fresh nature,
                  undisturbed.</p>
               <p>The hoopoe (who had played an important part in<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000096"/> promoting the acquaintance thus far) forsook his
                  perch above Balder's head, and after hovering for a moment in mid-air, as if to
                  select the best spot, he alighted on the mossy cushion at the foot of the twin
                  palm-trees. Such a couch might Adam and Eve have rejoiced to find in Paradise.
                  Balder took the hint, and without more ado threw himself down there, while
                  Gnulemah half knelt, half sat beside him, propped on her arm, her warm fingers
                  buried in the cool moss. The little master-of-ceremonies remained, with a fine
                  sense of propriety, between the two, preening and fluttering his brilliant
                  feathers and casting diamond glances sidelong.</p>
               <p>"You remember nothing before coming to this place, Gnulemah?"</p>
               <p>"Only dream-memories, that grow dimmer. Before this, I was a spirit in the great
                  picture, and when my lamp goes out I shall return thither."</p>
               <p>"Your lamp, Gnulemah?—what lamp?"</p>
               <p>"How can you understand me and yet not know what I know? My lamp is the light of
                  my life; it burns always in the temple yonder; when it goes out my life will
                  become a darkness, for I am Gnulemah, the daughter of fire!"</p>
               <p>"I knew not that my uncle was a poet," muttered Balder to himself. "A daughter of
                  fire,—yes, there is lightning in her eyes!" Aloud he said, secretly alluding to
                  the manner of his descent into the garden,—</p>
               <p>"I dropped from the sky into your world, Gnulemah. Though we can talk together,
                  whatever we tell each other will be new."</p>
               <p>She caught the idea of a lifetime spent instructing this delightful being, and
                  receiving in return instruction from him. She entered at once the charming
                  vista.</p>
               <p>"Tell me," she began, bending towards him in her earnestness, "are there others
                  like you?—are they bright and beautiful as you are?—or do they look like
                  Hiero?"</p>
               <p>Balder laughed, and flushed, and his heart warmed pleasurably. Here was a
                  compliment from the very soul of nature. And albeit the lovely flatterer's
                  experience of men was avowedly most limited, yet her taste was unvitiated as her
                  sincerity, and her judgment may therefore have been more valuable than that of the
                  most practised belle of fashion. But he answered modestly,—</p>
               <p>"Hiero and I are both men, and there are as many men as stars in heaven, and as
                  many women as men,—myriads of men and women, Gnulemah!"</p>
               <p>She lifted her face and hand in eloquent astonishment.</p>
               <p>"O, what a world!" she exclaimed in her low-toned way. "But are the women all like
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"There is not one like you," answered Balder, with<pb n="192-193"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000097"/> the quiet emphasis of conviction. How refreshing
                  was it thus to set aside conventionalism! Her ingenuousness brought forth the like
                  from him.</p>
               <p>"Have you never wished to go beyond the wall?" he asked her.</p>
               <p>"Yes, often!" she said, fingering the golden serpent thoughtfully. "But that could
                  not be unless I put out the lamp. Sometimes I get tired of this world,—it has
                  changed since I first came to it."</p>
               <p>"Is it less beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"It is smaller than it used to be," said Gnulemah, pensively. "Once the house was
                  so high, it seemed to touch heaven;—see how it has dwindled since then! And so
                  with other things that are on earth. The stars and the sun and clouds, they have
                  not changed!"</p>
               <p>"That is a consolation, is it not?" observed Balder, between a smile and a sigh.
                  Gnulemah was not the first to charge upon the world the alterations in the
                  individual; nor the first, either, to find comfort in the constancy of Heaven.</p>
               <p>She went on, won to further confidence by her listener's sympathy,—</p>
               <p>"I used to hope the wall would one day become so low that I might pass over it.
                  But it has ceased to change, and is still too high. Shall I ever see the other
                  side?"</p>
               <p>"It can be broken down if need be. But you might go far before finding a world so
                  fair as this. Perhaps it would be better to stand on the cliff, and only look
                  forth across the river."</p>
               <p>"I cannot stay always here," returned Gnulemah, shaking her turbaned head, with
                  its gleaming bandeau and rattling pendants. "But no wall is between me and the
                  sky; the flame of my lamp goes upward, and why should not Gnulemah?"</p>
               <p>"A friend is the only world one does not tire of," he replied after a pause. "You
                  have lacked companions."</p>
               <p>Gnulemah glanced down at the hoopoe, who forth-with warbled aloud and fluttered up
                  to her shoulder. The bird was her companion, and so, likewise, were the plants and
                  flowers. Gnulemah could converse with them in their own language. Nature was her
                  friend and confidant, and intimately communed with her.</p>
               <p>All this was conveyed to Balder's apprehension, not by words, but by some subtile
                  expressiveness of eye and gesture. Gnulemah could give voiceless utterances in a
                  manner pregnant and felicitous almost beyond belief.</p>
               <p>"I meet also a beautiful maiden in the looking-glass," she added; "her face and
                  motion are always the same as my own. But though she seems to speak, her voice
                  never reaches me; and she smiles, but only when I smile; and mourns only when I
                  mourn. We<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6660-00000098"/> can never reach each other;
                  but there is more in her than in my birds and flowers."</p>
               <p>"She is the shadow of yourself; no reality, Gnulemah."</p>
               <p>"Are we shadows of each other, then? is she weary of her world, as I of mine?
                  shall we both escape to some other,—or only pass each into the other's, and be
                  separated as before?"</p>
               <p>Balder, like wise men before him, was at some loss how to bring his wisdom to bear
                  here. He could not in one sentence explain the complicated phenomena in question.
                  Fortunately, however, Gnulemah (who had apparently not yet learned to appeal from
                  her own to another's judgment) seemed hardly to expect a solution to problems upon
                  which she had expended much private thought.</p>
               <p>"I have come to look on her as though she were myself, and she tells me secrets
                  which no one else can know. Some things she tells me that I do not care to hear,
                  but they are always true. I can see changes in her face that I feel in my own
                  heart."</p>
               <p>"Does she teach you that you grow every day more beautiful?" He was willing to
                  prove whether Gnulemah could thus be disconcerted. Many a woman had he known,
                  surprisingly innocent until a chance word or glance betrayed profoundest
                  depths.</p>
               <p>"Our beauty is like the garden, which is beautiful every day, though no day is
                  just like another. But the changes I mean are in the spirit that looks back at me
                  from her eyes, when I enter deeply into them."</p>
               <p>What connection could, after all, subsist between beauty and vanity in one who
                  neither had rivals nor aught to rival for? Doubtless she enjoyed her beauty,—the
                  more, as her taste was pure of conventional falsities. How much of worldly
                  experience would it take to vitiate that integrity in her? Would it not be better
                  to leave her to end her life, restricted to the same innocent and lovely
                  companionship which had been hers thus far? Here the hoopoe, startled at some
                  movement that Balder made, abandoned his perch on his mistress's shoulder, and
                  flew to the top of the palm-tree. Had the day when such friends would suffice her
                  needs gone by?</p>
               <p>Yes, it was now too late. No one who has beheld the sun can thenceforth dispense
                  with it. Balder had shone across the beautiful recluse's path, and linked her to
                  outside realities by a chain which, whether he went or stayed, would never break.
                  Flowers, birds, shadows in the mirror,—less than nothing would these things be to
                  her from this hour on.</p>
               <p>Heretofore the intercourse between the two had been tentative and incoherent,—a
                  doubtful, aimless grappling with strange conditions which seemed delightful, but
                  might mask unknown dangers. No solid basis of<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000099"/> mutual acquaintanceship had been even approached.
                  Balder, accustomed though he was to woman's society, knew not how to apply his
                  experience here; while Gnulemah had not yet perhaps decided whether her visitor
                  were natural or supernatural. The man was probably the less at ease of the two,
                  finding himself in a pass through which tradition nor culture could pilot him.
                  Gnulemah, being used to daily communion with things mysterious to her
                  understanding, would scarcely have altered her demeanor had Balder turned out to
                  be a genie!</p>
               <p>But the first step towards fixing the relations between them was already taken.
                  The young man's abrupt movement of his hand to his face (probably with purpose to
                  stroke the beard no longer growing there) had not only scared away the hoopoe, but
                  had flashed on Gnulemah a ray from the diamond ring.</p>
               <p>She rose to her feet suddenly, yet easily as a startled serpent rears erect its
                  body. Vivid emotion lightened in her face. Balder knew not what to make of the
                  look she gleamed at him.</p>
               <p>"What are you?" she asked, her voice sunk to almost a whisper. "Hiero?—are you
                  Hiero?"</p>
               <p>Balder stared confounded,—partly inclined to smile!</p>
               <p>"Come back,—transfigured!" she went on, her eyes deepening with awe. What did it
                  mean? some what disturbed, Balder got also on his feet. As he did so, Gnulemah
                  crouched before him, holding out her hands like a suppliant. An on-looker might
                  have fancied that the would-be God had found his worshipper at last!</p>
               <p>"My name is Balder," his Deityship managed to say. As he spoke, the sun rounded
                  the corner of the house, and the light fell brightly on him, Gnulemah kneeling in
                  shadow. The glory of his splendid youth seemed to have shone out from within him
                  in sudden effulgence.</p>
               <p>"Balder!" she slowly repeated, still gazing up at him.</p>
               <p>"There is a relationship between us," said he, a vague uneasiness urging him to
                  take refuge behind the quaint fantasy. "You are the daughter of fire, and I the
                  descendant of the sun!"</p>
               <p>He spoke the unpremeditated notion which the sunburst had created in his
                  brain,—spoke not seriously nor yet lightly. He had as much right to his genealogy
                  as she to hers.</p>
               <p>But what a strange effect his words wrought on her! She clasped her hands together
                  quickly in a kind of ecstasy.</p>
               <p>"The sun,—Balder! I have prayed to him,—he has come to me,—Balder, my God!" With
                  how divine an accent did her full low voice give him the<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000100"/> name to which he had dared aspire! He was God,—and
                  her God!</p>
               <p>He perhaps divined one part of the process through which her mind must have gone;
                  but he could not find a word to answer, whether of acceptance or disclaimer. He
                  turned pale,—his heart sick. Had the recognition of his Godhood been too tardy?
                  Gnulemah fancied he repulsed her, and her passion kindled,—only religious passion,
                  but it seared him!</p>
               <p>"Do not be cold to me, Balder!"—his name as she uttered it moved him as a
                  blasphemy. "In my lonely kneelings I have felt you! my eyes close, my hands grow
                  together, my breath flutters, every breath is joy and fear! I think 'He is with
                  me,—the Being I adore!' but when I opened my eyes, He was gone,—Balder!"</p>
               <p>Still motionless and seeming-deaf stood the Divinity, bathed in mocking sunlight.
                  He was powerless to stop her from unveiling to him, as to a visible God, the
                  sacred places of her maiden heart. That sublime office whose reversion he had
                  boldly courted, in the possession shrivelled his soul to nothing and left him
                  dead. It was not easy to be God,—even over one human being!</p>
               <p>But Gnulemah, in her mighty earnestness, knelt nearer, so that the edge of
                  Balder's sunlight smote the golden ornaments that clung round her outstretched
                  stretched arms. She almost touched him, but though his spirit recoiled, the
                  doltish flesh would not be moved.</p>
               <p>"It was not to be always so," she continued, an appealing vehemence quivering
                  through her tones. "Some day I was to see Him and know Him more clearly. Shine on
                  me, Balder! am not I your priestess? in the morning do not I worship you, and at
                  noon, and in the evening? At night do not I kneel at your altar and pray you to
                  care for me while I sleep? Hear me, Balder! I see you in all things,—they are your
                  thoughts and meet again in you! The sun himself is but your shadow! Do not I know
                  you, my Balder? Be not clouded from your servant! Leave me not,—take me with you
                  where you go!"</p>
               <p>It was at this moment that the young man's mind, stumbling stupidly hither and
                  thither, chanced to encounter that picture of the courtesan, leaning from the open
                  window in the city street, beckoning him to come. She took Gnulemah's place,
                  beckoning, making a hateful parody of Gnulemah's expression and gestures. Could a
                  devil take the consecrated place of angels? or was the angel a worse devil in
                  disguise? In the same day, to him the same man, could two such voices speak,—such
                  faces look? And could the germ of Godhead abide in a soul liable to the irony of
                  such vicarious solicitation?</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6660-00000101"/>
               <p>Speech or motion was still denied him. His priestess, strengthened by religious
                  passion, was bold to touch with hers his divine hand, on the finger of which
                  demoniacally glittered the murder-token. The hand was so cold and lax that even
                  the smooth warmth of her soft fingers failed to put life in it.</p>
               <p>"You have taken Hiero to yourself,—take me also! be my God as well as his, for I
                  shall be alone now he is gone. This ring which he always wore—"</p>
               <p>Balder roughly snatched back his hand.</p>
               <p>"Hiero's ring?"</p>
               <p>"Why do you look so?—is it not a sign to me from him?"</p>
               <p>"Hiero's ring?—tell me, Gnulemah, is this Hiero's ring?—Stop—stand up! No—call me
                  Satan!—Hiero's ring!"</p>
               <p>"Where is Hiero, then?" demanded Gnulemah, rising and dilating. "You wear his
                  ring,—what have you done with him?—Is there no God?"</p>
               <p>The words came riding on the waves of deep-drawn breaths, for her soul was in a
                  tumult. Her life had thus far been like a quiet sequestered pool, reflecting only
                  the sky, and the ferns and flowers that bent above its margin; ignorant, moreover,
                  of its own depth and nature. Now, invaded by storm, God and nature seemed swept
                  away and lost, and a terror of loneliness darkened over it.</p>
               <p>"Is there no Balder?" reiterated Gnulemah. But all at once the fierceness in her
                  eyes melted, as lightning is followed by summer rain. She came so near,—he
                  standing dulled with horror of his discovery,—came so near that her breath touched
                  him, and he could hear the faint rustling of the white byssus on her bosom, and
                  the soft tinkle of the broad pendants that glowed against her black hair; and
                  could see how profoundly real her beauty was. Mighty and beneficent must be the
                  force or the law which could combine the rude elements into such a form of life as
                  this!</p>
               <p>"Let me live for you and serve you! Though the world has no Balder, may not I have
                  mine? You shall be everything to me! Without you I cannot be; but I want no other
                  God if I have my Balder!"</p>
               <p>This was another matter! Nevertheless,—so subtile is the boundary between love
                  human and divine,—Gnulemah in these first passionate moments may easily have
                  deemed the one no less sublime than the other.</p>
               <p>But there was no danger of Balder's falling into such an error. The distinction
                  was clear to him. Yet with remorse and abasement strove the defiant impulse to
                  pluck and eat—forgetful of this world and the next—the royal fruit so fairly held
                  to his lips!</p>
               <p>For herein fails the divinity of nature,—she can minister as well to man's
                  depravity as to his exaltation<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6660-00000102"/> tion;
                  which could not happen were she one with God. Nay, man had need be strong with
                  Divine inspiration, before communing unharmed with nature's dangerous
                  loveliness.</p>
               <p>His hand in Gnulemah's was now neither cold nor lax. She raised it in impetuous
                  homage to her forehead. The diamond left a mark there; first white, then red. For
                  a breath or two, their eyes saw depths in each other beyond words'
                  fathoming....</p>
               <p>A door was closed above; and the echo stole down stairs and crept with a hollow
                  whisper into the conservatory. The little lord chamberlain fluttered down from his
                  lofty perch and hovered between the two faces, his penetrating note sounding like
                  a warning. Gnulemah drew back, and a swift blush let fall its rosy veil from the
                  golden gleam of her jewelled forehead-band to below the head of the serpent which
                  twisted round her neck.</p>
               <p>One parting look she gave Balder, pregnant of new wonder, fear, and joy. Then she
                  turned and glided with quick ophidian grace to the doorway from which she had
                  first appeared, and was eclipsed by the curtain. The inner door shut; she was
                  gone. Dull, dull and colorless was the conservatory. The hoopoe had flown out
                  through the hall to the open air. Only the crocodile continued to keep Balder
                  company.</p>
               <p>After standing a few moments, he once more threw himself down on the moss couch
                  beneath the palm-trees. There he reclined as before, supported on his elbow, and
                  turned the diamond ring this way and that on his finger in moody
                  preoccupation.</p>
               <p>Was the crocodile asleep, or stealthily watching him?</p>

               <head>XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">BEFORE SUNDOWN.</head>
               <p>IF Balder Helwyse had been in a vein for self-criticism at this juncture, the
                  review might probably have dissatisfied him. He possessed qualities which make men
                  great. He could have discharged august offices, for he saw things in large
                  relations and yet minutely. His mind and courage could rise to any enterprise, and
                  carry it with ease and cheerfully. His nature was even more receptive than active.
                  He had force of thought to electrify nations.</p>
               <p>But his was the old story of the star-gazer walking into the well, who might have
                  studied the stars in the well, but could not be warned of the well by the stars.
                  He had whistled grand chances down the wind, reaching after what was superhuman.
                  His hunger had been vast, but the food wherewith he had filled himself nourished
                  him not, and suddenly he had collapsed. His first actual step towards realizing
                  his lofty aspirations had landed him low amongst earth's common criminals,—nor had
                  the harm stopped there. That defiant impulse to which he had just now been on the
                  point of yielding had not dared so much as to have shown its face before his
                  unvitiated will. He was disorganized and at the mercy of events, because without
                  law sufficient to keep and guide himself.</p>
               <p>Though fallen, there was in him somewhat giant-like, perhaps easier to see now
                  than before,—as the ruin seems vaster than the perfect building. The travail of a
                  soul like Balder's must issue greatly, whether for good or ill. He could not
                  remain long inchoate, but the elements would combine to make something either
                  darker or fairer than had been before. Meanwhile, in the uncrystallized solution
                  the curious analyst might detect traits bright or sinister, ordinarily invisible.
                  Here were softness, impetuosity, romantic imagination, and tender fire, enough to
                  set up half a dozen poets. Again, there was a fund of malignity, coldness, and
                  subtlety adequate to the making an Iago. Here, too, were the clear sceptical
                  intellect, the fertility and versatile power of brain, which only the loftier
                  minds of the world have shown.</p>
               <p>Such seemingly incongruous qualities are, in the human crucible, so mingled,
                  proportioned, and refined, as to form a seeming simple and transparent whole. We
                  may feel the presence of a spirit weighty, strong, and deep, without understanding
                  the how and why of the impression. Only at critical moments, such as<pb
                     n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6660-00000104"/> this in Balder's life, can we point out
                  the joining lines.</p>
               <p>Balder's present attitude, viewed from whatever side, was no less irksome than
                  ignoble. One misfortune was with diabolic ingenuity dovetailed into another. It
                  was bad enough to have killed a man; but the victim was his own uncle, and the
                  father—at least the foster-father—of Gnulemah. And she, forsooth, must idolize the
                  murderer; and, finally, his heart must leap forth in passionate response to hers
                  at the moment—partly perhaps for the reason—that every honest motive forbade it.
                  That look and touch, at the molten point of various emotions, had welded their
                  spirits together at once and lastingly.</p>
               <p>What next? For Gnulemah and for himself what course was least disastrous?—the
                  heroic line,—to leave her without a word?—or, concealing what he was, should he
                  stay and be happy in her arms? Was there a third alternative?</p>
               <p>"To part would be yet worse for her than for me. She would think I had deceived
                  her. And, love apart, how can I leave her whose only protector I have killed? That
                  deed puts me in his place; so love and duty are at one for once. Her Balder,—her
                  God,—she calls me. She is my universe; the depth and limit of my knowledge and
                  power are gauged by her. Such is the issue of my aspirations!"</p>
               <p>He breathed out a half-laugh, ending in a sigh. "But loving her is sweeter than to
                  inform creation!" he added, aloud.</p>
               <p>The crocodile made no reply. Balder went on, fingering the telltale ring and
                  talking with himself; the earth, meanwhile, slowly turning her warm shoulder to
                  the western sun. A still half-light filled the conservatory as with a clear mellow
                  liquor, and the rich leaves and blossoms stood breathless with delight. The
                  painfully rigid contraction of Balder's features was softening away; he was coming
                  into harmony with the sensuous beauty of the scene, or its refined
                  voluptuousness—serene, unambitious, content with time and careless of
                  eternity—interpreted his altered temper.</p>
               <p>Be happy in the sunlight, O men and women! Love and kiss,—bow down and worship
                  each the other! Who can tell of another joy like this? Everlasting knows it not,
                  for only the flavor of death can give it perfection! Save for the foreshadow of
                  midnight, noonday were not beautiful. But when night comes, sink ye in one
                  another's arms, and sleep! Heaven on earth is a richer, stronger draught than
                  Heaven; but pray that in vouchsafing death, it cheat ye not of annihilation!</p>
               <p>He had forgotten that there was anything ugly in the world, or that the blindest
                  cannot always escape the Gorgon. He recked not the risk of bringing a being<pb
                     n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6660-00000105"/> such as Gnulemah face to face with
                  modern life, nor bethought him that the secret in his heart would still be nearer
                  it than love could come. Neither, during this fortunate moment, did fear of
                  discovery harass him.</p>
               <p>Oddly, too, it was not to domestic comforts,—the love of wife, children, and
                  friends,—nor yet to the absorbing duties of a profession, that Balder looked for a
                  shield against inward trouble. Hope held him no more than fear; his happiness must
                  consist in freedom from both. He thought only of the Gnulemah of today,—unique,
                  beautiful, untamed, divinely ignorant; but whose heart walked before, leading the
                  giddy mind by paths the wisest dared not tempt. The sounds of her voice, the
                  shiftings of her expression, her look, her touch,—he recalled them all. He centred
                  time and space in her. Change, new conditions, succession of events,—these came
                  not near her. Their life should know neither past nor future, but abide a constant
                  Now,—until the end!</p>
               <p>His lips followed his thought with soundless movement. Handsome lips they
                  were,—the under, full, but sharply defined from the bulwark-chin; the upper,
                  slender, boldly curved, firm, yet sensitive;—the mouth was a compendium of the
                  man's physical nature. His eyes, large and almost as dark as Gnulemah's, albeit
                  far different in effect,—were now in-looking; the pupils, always extraordinarily
                  large and brilliant, almost filled the space between the eyelids. His hair clung
                  round his head in yellow curls; the dark dense eyebrows arched at ease. With
                  velvet doublet and well-moulded limbs, in the enchanted evening-glow, he looked
                  the ideal fairy prince,—noble, wise, and valiant; conquering fate for love's sake.
                  They were brave princes,—they of old time. But one wonders whether the giants and
                  enchanters, nowadays, are not stronger and subtler than they used to be!</p>

               <head>XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">BETWEEN WAKING AND SLEEPING.</head>
               <p>THERE was an old woman in the house who went by the name of Nurse; her duties
                  being to cook the meals and preserve a sort of order in such of the rooms as were
                  occupied by the family. Since the greater part of the house was uninhabited, and
                  there were only two mouths to feed beside her own, Nurse was not without leisure
                  moments. How were they employed?</p>
               <p>Not in gossiping, for she had no cronies. Not in millinery and dressmaking, for
                  there were no admiring eyes to reward such labors. Not in gadding, for she might
                  not pass the imprisoning wall. Not even in reading, perhaps because she was not
                  much of a proficient in that art.</p>
               <p>The truth is that—to the outward eye at least—she was uniformly idle. For years
                  past she had spent many hours of each night in the corner of the kitchen
                  fireplace, which was as large, roomy, and smoke-seasoned as any in story-books or
                  mediæval halls. Here sat she, winter and summer, her body bent forward over her
                  knees, her disfigured face supported on one hand, while the other lay across her
                  breast. This was her common position, and she seldom moved to change it. She
                  hummed tunes to herself sometimes,—not hymn tunes,—but never was heard to utter an
                  articulate word. Often you might have thought her asleep,—but no! when you least
                  expected it a shining black eye was fixed on you; an eye which, two hundred years
                  ago, would have convicted its owner of witch-craft. It was the only bright thing
                  about the poor woman.</p>
               <p>Whenever the master of the house came to the kitchen, Nurse's witch-eye followed
                  him animal-like; no movement of his, no expression, seemed to escape it. A curious
                  observer might sometimes have remarked in her, during the few moments after the
                  man's entrance, a muffled agitation, an irregularity of the breath, an obscure
                  anxiety and suspense. This, however, would soon subside, and rarely recur during
                  his stay. The phenomenon had been observable daily for nearly a score of years,
                  yet nothing had meantime happened to explain or justify it. Had an original
                  dread—groundless or not—prolonged its phantom existence precisely because it had
                  never met with justification?</p>
               <p>Often for weeks at a time, complete silence would obtain between master and Nurse.
                  He would enter<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6660-00000107"/> and ramble hither and
                  thither the ample kitchen; eat what had been prepared for him, and be off again
                  without a word or glance of acknowledgment. Or, again, pacing irregularly to and
                  fro before the fireplace, he would pour forth long disjointed rhapsodies, wild
                  speculations, hopes, and misgivings; his mood changing from solemn to gay, and
                  round through gusty passion to morbid gloom. But never did he address his words to
                  Nurse so much as to himself or to some imaginary interlocutor; and she for her
                  part never answered him a syllable, but sat in silence through it all. Yet was she
                  ever alert to listen, and sometimes the subdued trembling would come on and the
                  obstruction of breath. But when the talker, in mid-excitement of speech, snatched
                  his violin and drew from it melodies weirdly exquisite, soothing his diseased
                  thoughts and harmonizing them, Nurse would become once more composed; the phantom
                  danger was again put off, and the violinist would presently fall into
                  silence,—sometimes into sleep. But still, while he slept, the witch-eye watched
                  him; though with an expression of yearning, uncouth intensity which seldom
                  ventured forth while he was awake.</p>
               <p>With Gnulemah, Nurse's intercourse became yearly more and more infrequent. As the
                  child arose to womanhood, she grew apart from the voiceless creature who had cared
                  for her infancy. It was not Gnulemah's fault, whose heart was never barren of
                  loving impulses. But mother, father, were words whose meaning she had never been
                  taught; and had Nurse comprehended the unconscious thirst and hunger of the girl's
                  soul,—unconscious, but not therefore harmless,—she might have tried, by dint of
                  affectionate observances and companionship, to represent the motherly office which
                  she had filled in the beginning. But this was not to be. Some hidden agency had
                  forced the two ever farther asunder. Moreover, Gnulemah developed rapidly, while
                  Nurse underwent a process of gradual congealment,—her wits and emotions became
                  torpid. Besides this, she was the victim of disfigurement, physical as well as
                  spiritual; while Gnulemah, both naturally and by training, was sensitive to beauty
                  and ugliness. Other surface causes no doubt there were, in addition to the hidden
                  one, which was perhaps the most potent of all.</p>
               <p>A considerable time had passed since Gnulemah's departure, when Balder became
                  aware that he was not alone in the conservatory. His thoughts were all of
                  Gnulemah, and he looked quickly round in expectation of seeing her. The apparition
                  of a widely different object startled him to his feet.</p>
               <p>A female figure stood before him, wrapped in sad-colored garments of anomalous
                  description, her head tied up in dark turban-like folds of cloth. A lock of rusty
                  black hair escaped from beneath this head-dress<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000108"/> and hung down beside her face. She might once have
                  been tall and erect, but her form now sagged to the left, losing both height and
                  dignity. Her visage, seamed and furrowed by the scar of some terrible calamity,
                  had lost its natural contour. The left eye was extinguished, but the right
                  remained,—the only feature in its original state. It was dark and bright, and
                  possessed, by very virtue of its disfigured environment, a repulsive kind of
                  beauty. Its influence was peculiar. In itself, it postulated an owner in the prime
                  of life, handsome and graceful. But, one's attention wandering, the woman's actual
                  ugliness impressed itself with an intensity enhanced by the imaginary
                  contrast.</p>
               <p>A grotesque analogy was thus brought to light. The woman was dual. Her right side
                  lived; the left—blind, inert, and soulless—was dragged about a dead weight. It was
                  an unnatural emphasizing of the spiritual-material composition of mankind.
                  Observable, moreover, was her strange method of disguising emotion. There was no
                  muscular constraint; she simply turned her blank left side to the spectator, with
                  an effect like the interposition of a dead wall!</p>
               <p>Such, on Balder's perhaps abnormally excited apprehension, was the impression the
                  nurse produced. She, on her part, was perhaps more disconcerted than he. Her
                  single eye settled upon him in a panic of surprise. The dressing of the scene gave
                  Balder a grisly reminder of the first moments of Gnulemah's eloquent astonishment.
                  There was as great an apparent difference between the superb Egyptian and this
                  poor creature, as between good and evil; but there was also the disagreeable
                  suggestion of a similar kind of relationship. Gnulemah, withered, stifled, and
                  degraded by some unmentionable curse, might have become a thing not unlike this
                  woman.</p>
               <p>"Have we met before, madam?" asked Helwyse, impelled to the question by what he
                  took for a bewildered recognition in her eye.</p>
               <p>She moved her lips, but made no audible answer.</p>
               <p>"I am Balder Helwyse," he added; for he had made up his mind that all concealments
                  (save one) were unnecessary.</p>
               <p>A grotesque quake of emotion travelled through the woman's body, and she gave
                  utterance to a harsh inarticulate sound. She came confusedly forwards, groping
                  with hands outstretched. Balder, though not wont to fail in courtesy to the
                  sorriest hag, could scarce forbear recoiling; especially because he fancied that
                  an expression of affectionate interest was struggling to get through the scarred
                  incrustation of the woman's nature.</p>
               <p>Perhaps she marked his inward shrinking, for she checked herself, and, slowly
                  turning her lifeless screen, hid behind it. It was impotent deprecation translated
                  into flesh,—at once ludicrous and painful. The young<pb n="216-217"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000109"/> man found so much difficulty in restraining the
                  manifestation of his distaste, that he blushed in the twilight at his own
                  rudeness. He would do his best to redeem himself.</p>
               <p>"Doctor Hiero Glyphic is my uncle," said he, moving to get on Nurse's right side,
                  and speaking in his pleasantest tone. "Is he at home? I have come a long way to
                  see him."</p>
               <p>Preoccupied by his amiable purpose to reassure the woman, Helwyse had got to the
                  end of this speech before realizing the ghastly mockery involved in it.
                  Nevertheless, it was well. Even thus falsely and boldly must he henceforth speak
                  and act. By a happy accident he had opened the path, and must see to it that his
                  further steps did not retrograde.</p>
               <p>Still Nurse answered not a word, which was the less surprising, inasmuch as she
                  had been dumb for a quarter of a century past. But Balder, supposing her silence
                  to proceed from stupidity or deafness, repeated more loudly and peremptorily,—</p>
               <p>"Doctor Glyphic,—is he here? is he alive?"</p>
               <p>He felt a morbid curiosity to hear what reply would be made to the question whose
                  answer only he could know. But he was puzzled to observe that it appeared to throw
                  Nurse into a state of agitation as great as though she had herself been the
                  perpetrator of Balder's crime! She stood quaking and irresolute, now peeping for a
                  moment from behind her screen, then dodging back with an increase of panic.</p>
               <p>This display—rendered more uncouth by its voicelessness—revolted the aesthetic
                  sensibilities of Helwyse. Besides, what was the meaning of it? Had it actually
                  been Davy Jones with whom he had striven on the midnight sea? and had his
                  adversary, instead of drowning, spread his bat-wings for home, and left his
                  supposititious murderer to disquiet himself in vain? Verily, a practical joke
                  worthy its author!</p>
               <p>This conceit revealed others, as a lightning-flash the midnight landscape. Balder
                  was encircled by witchcraft,—had been ferried by a real Charon to no imaginary
                  Hades. The quaint secluded beauty of circumstance was an illusion, soon to be
                  dispelled. Gnulemah herself—miserable thought!—was perhaps a thing of evil; what
                  if this very hag were she in another form? Glancing round in the deepening
                  twilight, Balder fancied the dark, still plants and tropic shrubs assumed demoniac
                  forms, bending and crowding about him. The old witch yonder was muttering some
                  infernal spell; already he felt numbness in his limbs, dizziness in his brain.</p>
               <p>The devils are gathering nearer. A heavy, heated atmosphere quivers before his
                  eyes, or else the witch and her unholy crew are uniting in a reeling dance. In
                  vain does Balder try to shut his eyes and escape<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000110"/> the giddy spectacle; they stare widely open and see
                  things supernatural. Nor can he ward off these with his hands, which are rigid
                  before him, and defy his will. The devilish jig becomes wilder, and careers
                  through the air, Balder sweeping with it. In mid-whirl, he sees the
                  crocodile,—cold, motionless, waiting with long, dry jaws—for what?</p>
               <p>A cry breaks from him. With a wrench that strains his heart he bursts loose from
                  the devil's bonds that confine his limbs. The witch has vanished, and Helwyse
                  seems to himself to fall headlong from a vast height, striking the earth at last
                  helpless and broken.</p>
               <p>"Gnulemah!"</p>
               <p>Gasping out that name, he becomes insensible.</p>
               <p>Beneath an outside of respectable composure have turmoiled the tides of such
                  remorse and pain as only a man at once largely and finely made can feel. Added to
                  the mental excitement carried through many phases to the point of distraction,
                  have been bodily exertion and want of food and sleep. The apparition of unnatural
                  ugliness, of behavior strange as her looks, coming upon him in this untoward
                  condition, needed not the heat of the conservatory and stupefying perfume of the
                  flowers to bring on the brief delirium and final unconsciousness. As he lies there
                  let us remember that his last word threw back the unworthy, dark misgiving, that
                  beauty and deformity, good and bad, could by any jugglery become convertible.</p>
               <p>As a mere matter of fact, Nurse was no witch, nor had she, of her own will and
                  knowledge, done Balder any harm. On the contrary, she was already at work, with
                  trembling hands and painfully thumping heart, to relieve his sad case. She was
                  touched and agitated to a singular degree. It was not the first time in the
                  patient's life that she had tended him. The reader has guessed her secret,—that
                  she had known Balder before he knew himself, and cared for him when his only cares
                  had been to eat and sleep. She knew her baby through his manly stature and mature
                  features, less from his likeness to his father than from certain uneffaced traces
                  of infantine form and expression. She was of gypsy blood, and had looked on few
                  human faces since last seeing his. He did not recognize her until some time
                  afterwards. All things considered, it was hardly possible he should do so.</p>
               <p>It was curious to observe how awkwardly she now managed emotions that had once
                  flowed but too readily. She was moved by impulses which she had long forgotten how
                  to interpret. Her only outlet for tenderness was her solitary eye, which might
                  well have given way under the strain thus put upon it.</p>
               <p>But by and by the inward heat began to thaw the stiff outward crust, which had
                  been hardening for so many years. Glimpses there were of the handy, affectionate,
                  sympathizing woman, emerging from fossilization<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000111"/> ization. Her withered heart once more hungered and
                  thirsted, and the strange duality tended to melt back again into unity.</p>
               <p>Balder's attack at length yielded, and a drowsy consciousness returned, memory and
                  reason being still partly in abeyance. His heavy, half-closed eyes rested on
                  darkness. A crooning sound was in his ear,—a nursery lullaby, wordless but
                  soothing. Where was he? Had he been ill? Was he in his cradle at home? Was Salome
                  sitting by to watch him and give him his medicine? Yes, very ill he was, but would
                  be better in the morning; and meanwhile he would be a good boy, and not cry and
                  make a fuss and trouble Salome.</p>
               <p>"Nurse,—Sal!—I say, Sal!"</p>
               <p>Salome bent over him as of old.</p>
               <p>"Had such a funny dream, Sal! dreamt I was grown up, and—killed a man! What makes
                  you shake so, Sal? it was n't true, you know! And I'm going to be a good boy and
                  go to sleep. Good night! give a kiss from me—to—my—little—"</p>
               <p>So sinks he into slumber, profound as ever wooed his childhood; his head pillowed
                  in Salome's lap, his funny dream forgotten.</p>

               <head type="sub">WE PICK UP ANOTHER THREAD.</head>
               <p>DARKNESS and silence reigned in the conservatory; the group of the sleeping man
                  and attendant woman was lost in the warm gloom, and scarcely a motion—the low
                  drawing of a breath—told of their presence.</p>
               <p>A great gray owl, which had passed the daylight in some obscure corner, launched
                  darkling forth on the air, and winged hither and thither,—once or twice fanning
                  the sleeper's face with silent pinions. The crocodile lazily edged off the stone,
                  plumped quietly into the water, and clambered up the hither margin of the pool,
                  there coming to another long pause. A snail, making a night-journey across the
                  floor, found in its path a diamond, sparkling with a light of its own. The snail
                  extended a cool cautious tentacle,—recoiled it fastidiously and shaped a new
                  course. A broad petal from a tall flowering-shrub dropped wavering down, and
                  seemed about to light on Balder's forehead; but, swerving at the last moment, came
                  to rest on the scaly head of the crocodile. The night waited and listened,<pb
                     n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6660-00000112"/> as though for something to happen,—for
                  some one to appear! Salome, too, was waiting for some one;—was it for the
                  dead?</p>
               <p>Meantime, pictures from the past glimmered through her memory. When, in our magic
                  mirror, we saw her struck down by the hand of her lover, she was far from being
                  the repulsive object she is now. Indeed, but for that chance word let fall
                  yesterday, about her having been badly burnt, we might be at a loss to justify our
                  recognition of her.</p>
               <p>After Manetho's rude dismissal of her, she fled—not knowing whither better—to Thor
                  Helwyse, who was living widowed in his Brooklyn house, with his infant son and
                  daughter. Because she had been Helen's attendant, she besought Helen's husband to
                  give her a home. She was in sore trouble, but said no more than this; and Thor,
                  suspecting nothing of her connection with Manetho, gladly received her as nurse to
                  his children.</p>
               <p>But past sins and imprudences would find out Salome no less than others. At the
                  critical moment for herself and her fortunes, the house took fire. She risked her
                  life to save Thor's daughter, was herself burned past recognition, and (one
                  misfortune treading on another's heels) balanced on death's verge for a month or
                  two. She got well, in part; but the faculty of speech had left her, and beauty of
                  face and figure was forever gone.</p>
               <p>In her manifold wretchedness, and after such devotion shown, it was not in Thor's
                  warm heart to part with her; so, losing much, she gained something. She remained
                  with her benefactor, whose manly courtesy ever forbore to probe the secret of her
                  woman's heart, over which as over her face she always wore a veil. The world saw
                  Salome no more. She sat in the nursery, watching year by year the dark-eyed little
                  maiden playing with the fair-haired boy. Broad-shouldered Thor would come in, with
                  his grand, kindly face and royal beard; would kiss the little girl and tussle with
                  the boy, mightily laughing the while at the former's solicitude for her playmate;
                  would throw himself on the groaning sofa, and exclaim in his deep voice,—</p>
               <p>"God bless their dear little souls! Why, Nurse! when did a brother and sister ever
                  love each other like that,—eh?"</p>
               <p>Salome probably was not unhappy then; indeed,—whether she knew it or not,—she was
                  at her happiest. But new events were at hand. Thor, growing yearly more restless,
                  at length resolved to sell his house and go to Europe, taking with him Salome and
                  both the children. Everything was ready, down to the packing of Salome's box. A
                  day or two before the sailing, Thor went to New Jersey, to bid farewell to his
                  eccentric brother-in-law. It was a warm summer day, and the children played from
                  morning till night in the<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6660-00000113"/> front yard,
                  while Nurse sat in the window and kept her eye on them. Her thoughts, perhaps,
                  travelled elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Since her misfortune she had, no doubt, had more opportunity than most women for
                  reflection: silence breeds thought. What she thought about, no one knew; but she
                  could hardly have forgotten Manetho. On this last evening, when at the point of
                  leaving America forever, it would have been strange had no memory of him passed
                  through her mind.</p>
               <p>She had not heard his name in the last four years, and she knew that he suspected
                  nothing of her where-abouts. Had he ever wished to see her? she wondered; and
                  thought, "He would not know me if he did see me!" With that came a tumultuous
                  longing once more to look upon him. Too late! Why had she not thought of this
                  before? Now must her last memory of him be still as when, disfigured by sudden
                  rage, he turned upon her and struck her on the bosom. There was the scar yet; the
                  fire had spared it! It was a keepsake which, as time passed, Salome strangely
                  learned to love!</p>
               <p>It was growing dusk,—time for the children to come in. They were sitting deep in
                  the abundant grass, weaving necklaces out of dandelion-stems. Nurse leaned out of
                  window and beckoned to attract their attention. But either they were too much
                  absorbed to notice her, or they were wilfully blind; so Nurse rose to go out and
                  fetch them.</p>
               <p>Before reaching the open front door, she stopped short and her heart seemed to
                  turn over. A tall dark man was leaning over the fence, talking with the little
                  girl. Nurse shrank within the shadow of the door, and thence peeped and
                  listened,—as well as her beating pulses would let her.</p>
               <p>"I know where fairy-land is," says the man, in the soft, engaging tone that the
                  listener so well remembers.</p>
               <p>"Come! shall we go together and visit it?"</p>
               <p>"He come too?" asks the little maiden, nodding towards the boy, who is
                  portentously busy over his dandelions.</p>
               <p>"He may if he likes," the man answers with a smile. "But we must make haste, or
                  fairy-land will be shut up!"</p>
               <p>It flashes into Salome's head what this portends. She had heard this man vow
                  revenge on Thor Long ago, and she now sees how he means to keep his oath. He has
                  shrewdly improved the opportunity of Thor's absence, and has come intending to
                  carry off either his son or his daughter. Fortune, it seems, has chosen for him
                  the dark-eyed little girl. See! he stoops and lifts her gently over the wall, and
                  they are off for fairy-land!</p>
               <p>Rush out, Salome! alarm the neighborhood and force<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000114"/> the kidnapper to give up his booty! After Thor's
                  kindness to you, will you be false to him? Besides, what motive have you for
                  unfaithfulness? Grant that you love Manetho,—what harm, save to his revengeful
                  passion, could result from thwarting him?</p>
               <p>Salome acted oddly on this occasion,—it would seem, irrationally. But that which
                  appears to the spectator but a trivial modification may have vital weight with the
                  actor. Had Manetho taken Balder, for example, Salome might have pursued another
                  and more intelligible course than the one she actually took. She hurried out of
                  the door and caught Manetho by the arm before he was twenty paces on his way. He
                  turned, savage but frightened, setting down the little girl but not letting go her
                  hand. She was in her happiest humor, and informed Nurse that she was to be queen
                  of fairy-land!</p>
               <p>Nurse lifted the veil from her face and looked steadfastly at Manetho with her one
                  eye. It was enough,— he saw in her but a hideous object,—would never know her for
                  the bright girl he had once professed to love. Salome gave one sob, containing
                  more of womanly emotion than could be written down in many words, and then was
                  quiet and self-possessed. Manetho did not offer to escape, but stood on his guard;
                  half prepared, however,—from something in the woman's manner,—to find her a
                  confederate.</p>
               <p>"S"e come too?" chirped the unconscious little maiden.</p>
               <p>But Manetho's attention was turned to some words that Salome was writing in a
                  little blank-book which she always carried in her pocket. She offered to help him
                  carry off the child, on condition of being herself one of the party!</p>
               <p>He looked narrowly at the woman, but could make nothing by his scrutiny. Was it
                  love for the child that prompted her behavior? No; for she could easily have
                  raised the neighborhood against him. She completely puzzled him, and she would
                  give no explanations. What if he should accept her offer? She would be an
                  advantage as well as an inconvenience. The child would have the care to which it
                  had been accustomed, and Manetho would thus be spared much embarrassment. When the
                  woman's help became superfluous, it would not be difficult to give her the
                  slip.</p>
               <p>There was small leisure for reflection. An agreement was made,—on Salome's part,
                  with a secret sense of intense triumph, not unmixed with fear and pain. She caught
                  up Master Balder and his dandelions, kissed and hugged him violently, and locked
                  him into the nursery; where he was found some hours afterwards by his father, in a
                  state of great hunger and indignation. But the little dark-haired maiden was seen
                  no more. She was gone to her kingdom of fairyland<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000115"/> land, and Nurse with her. Long mourned Balder for
                  his vanished playmate!</p>
               <p>Salome has kept her secret well. And now, there she sits, her long-lost baby's
                  head in her lap, thinking of old times; and the longer she thinks, the more she
                  softens and expands. Has she done a great wrong in her life? Surely she has
                  suffered greatly, and in a manner that might well wither her to the core. But
                  there must still have been a germ of life in the shrivelled seed, which this
                  night—memorable in her existence—has begun to quicken.</p>
               <p>By and by come a few tears, with a struggle at first, then more easily. Kind
                  darkness lets us think of Salome bright and comely as in the old days, with the
                  added grace of inward beauty wrought by sad experience. But, in truth, she is
                  marred past earthly recovery. Nothing removes a soul so far from human sympathy as
                  self-repression,—especially for any merely human end!</p>
               <p>The night creeps reluctantly westward; the gray owl wings back to his shady
                  corner; the adventurous snail, half-way up the palm-tree, glues himself to the
                  bark and turns in for a nap. The crocodile has resumed his old position on the
                  rock in the pool, and the flower petal floats on the water. Here comes the
                  brilliant hoopoe with his smart crest and clear chirrup, impatient to bid Gnulemah
                  good morning! All is as before, save that the group beneath the palm-trees has
                  disappeared!</p>
               <p>Balder slept late, yet, on awakening, he thought he must be dreaming still. He
                  could not distinguish imagination from reality. His mind had temporarily lost its
                  grasp, his will its authority. Where was he? Was it years or hours since he had
                  entered Boston harbor?</p>
               <p>Suddenly rose before him the vision of the deadly struggle on the midnight sea.
                  Round this central point the rest crystallized in order. His heart sank, and he
                  sighed most heavily. But presently he rose to his elbow and stared about in
                  bewilderment. Had he ever seen this room before? How came he here?</p>
               <p>He was lying on a carved bedstead, furnished with sheets of fine linen and a
                  counterpane of blue embroidered satin; but all bearing an appearance of great age.
                  The room was oval, like a bird's-egg halved lengthwise; the smoothly vaulted
                  ceiling being frescoed with a crowd of figures. The rich and costly furniture
                  harmonized with the bedstead, and bore the same marks of age. The chairs and
                  lounge were satin-covered; the sumptuous toilet-table was fitted with a mirror of
                  true crystal; the arched window was curtained with azure satin and lace. It was a
                  chamber fit for a princess of the old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">régime</foreign>,
                  unaltered since its fair occupant last abode in it.</p>
               <p>Balder now examined the frescos which covered<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000116"/> wall and ceiling. The subject seemed at the first
                  glance to be a Last Judgment, or something of that nature. A mingled rush of forms
                  mounted on one side to the bright zenith, and thence lapsed confusedly down the
                  opposite descent. The dark end of the room presented a cloud of gloomily fantastic
                  shapes, swerved from the main stream, and becoming darker and more formless the
                  farther they receded, till at the last they were lost in a murky shadow. Not
                  entirely lost, however; for as Balder gazed awfully thitherward, the shadow seemed
                  to resolve itself into a mass of intertwined and struggling beings, neither animal
                  nor human, but combining the more unholy traits of both.</p>
               <p>But from the centre of the upward stream shone forms and faces of angelic beauty;
                  yet, on looking more narrowly, Balder discerned in each one some ghastly
                  peculiarity, revealing itself just when enjoyment of the beauty was on the point
                  of becoming complete. Such was the effect that the most angelic forms were
                  translated into mocking demons, and where the light seemed brightest there was the
                  spiritual darkness most profound.</p>
               <p>In the zenith was a white lustre which obliterated distinction of form as much as
                  did the cloudy obscurity at the end of the room. Now the design seemed about to
                  unfold itself; then again it eluded the gazer's grasp. Suddenly at length it stood
                  revealed. A gigantic face, with wide-floating hair and beard, looked down into
                  Balder's own. Its expression was of infinite malignity and despair. The
                  impersonation of all that is wicked and miserable, its place was at the top of
                  Heaven; it was moulded of those aspiring forms of light, and was the goal which
                  the brightest attained. Moreover, either by some ugly coincidence or how otherwise
                  he could not conceive, this countenance of supreme evil was the very reflex of
                  Balder's,—a portrait minutely true, and, despite its satanic expression, growing
                  every moment more unmistakable.</p>
               <p>Was this accident, or the contrivance of an unknown and unfathomable malice?
                  Balder, Lord of Heaven, instinct with the essence of Hell! A grim satire on his
                  religious speculations! But what satirist had been bitter enough so to forestall
                  the years?—for the painting must have been designed while Balder was still an
                  infant.</p>
               <p>He threw himself off the bed and stepped to the window, and saw the blue sky and
                  the river rhyming it. The breath of the orchard visited him, and he was greeted by
                  the green grass and trees. He sighed with relief. There had been three mornings
                  since his return to America. For the first he had blessed his own senses; the
                  second had looked him out of countenance; but the third came with a benediction,
                  serene and mighty, such as Balder's soul had not hitherto been open to.</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6660-00000117"/>
               <p>"This is more than a plaster heaven," said he, looking up; "but I fear, Balder
                  Helwyse, your only heaven, thus far, has been of plaster. You have seen this
                  morning how the God of such a heaven looks. How about the God of this larger
                  Heaven, think you?"</p>
               <p>Presently he turned away from the window; but he had quaffed so deeply of the
                  morning glory, that the sinister frescos no longer depressed him. They were
                  ridiculously unimportant,— nothing more than stains on the wall, in fact. Balder
                  could not tell why he felt light-hearted. It was solemn light-heartedness,—not the
                  gayety of sensuous spirits, such as he had experienced heretofore. It had little
                  to do with physical well-being, for the young man was still faint and dizzy, and
                  weak from hunger. Behold, then, at the foot of the bed, a carved table covered
                  with a damask cloth and crowned with an abundant breakfast; not an ordinary
                  breakfast of coffee, rolls, omelette, and beefsteak, but a pastoral
                  breakfast,—fresh milk, bread and honey and fruit and mellow cheese,—such food as
                  Adam might have begun the day with.</p>
               <p>In face of the yet unsolved mystery of his own presence in the room, this new
                  surprise caused Balder no special wonder. Beyond the apparition of the ugly dumb
                  woman, he recollected nothing of the previous evening's experience. Could she have
                  transported him hither? Well, he would not let himself be disturbed by apparent
                  miracles. "No doubt the explanation is simple," thought he; and with that he began
                  his toilet.</p>
               <p>The dressing-table displayed a variety of dainty articles such as a lady might be
                  supposed to use,—pearl-handled brushes, enamelled powder-boxes, slender vases of
                  Meissen porcelain, a fanciful ring-stand; from the half-open drawer a rich glimpse
                  of an Indian fan; a pair of delicate kid gloves, which only a woman's hands could
                  have worn, were thrown carelessly on the table. There were still the little
                  wrinkles in the fingers, but time had changed the pristine white to dingy
                  yellow.</p>
               <p>"Whose hands could have worn them? whose chamber was this?" mused Balder. "Not
                  Gnulemah's; she knows nothing of kid gloves and powder! and these things were in
                  use before she was born. Whose face was reflected in this glass, when those gloves
                  were thrown down here? Was that her marriage-bed? Were children born in it?"</p>
               <p>His seizure of the night before must have dulled the edge of his wit, else he had
                  scarce asked questions which chance now answered for him. A scratch on one corner
                  of the polished mirror-surface showed, on closer inspection, a name and a date
                  written with a diamond. Shading off the light with his hand, Balder read, "Helen,
                  1831."</p>
               <p>"My mother's name; the year I was born. My<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000118"/> mother!" he repeated softly, taking up the old
                  yellow gloves. "And this room was my birthplace,— and my little sister's! My
                  mother's things, as she left them; for father once told me that he never entered
                  her room after she was buried. She died here; and here my little sister and I
                  began to live. And here I am, again,—really the same little helpless innocent baby
                  who cried on that bed so long ago. Only not innocent now! Perhaps, not helpless,
                  either!</p>
               <p>"How happy that barber was yesterday! prattled about being born again. Cannot I be
                  born again—to-day,—in this room? Here I first began, and have come round the world
                  to my starting-point. I will begin afresh this morning."</p>
               <p>And heavily as he was weighted in the new race, he would not be disheartened.
                  Unuttered resolves brightened his eyes and made his courage high.</p>
               <p>Before beginning breakfast, he returned to the window and drank again of the
                  divine blue and green. From the branch of a near tree the hoopoe startled him and
                  made him color. Was the bird an emissary from Gnulemah? Balder's mouth drew back,
                  and his chin and eyes strengthened, as though some part of his unuttered resolves
                  were recalled by the thought of her.</p>
               <p>When he was ready to go, he turned at the door, and threw a parting glance round
                  the dainty old-fashioned chamber, trying to gather into one all the thoughts,
                  memories, and resolves connected with it. He had nearly forgotten the frescos; the
                  victorious sunshine had reduced the figures, satanic or beautiful, to a
                  meaningless agglomeration of wandering lines and faded colors. As for his own
                  portrait, it was no longer distinguishable!</p>

               <head type="sub">HEART AND HEAD.</head>
               <p>BALDER easily found his way to the conservatory, but it was empty,—Gnulemah, at
                  least, was not there! The tapestry curtain in her doorway was pushed aside, the
                  door itself open. Where should he seek her?</p>
               <p>As he stood in doubt, he saw lying at his feet a violet. Picking it up, he saw
                  another some distance beyond it, and still another on the threshold which he had
                  just crossed. They were Gnulemah's footsteps,—the scent of this sweet quarry,
                  teaching him how to follow her. So he followed, nor let one fragrant trace escape
                  him; and presently he had a nosegay of them.</p>
               <p>She was out of doors, then. Truly, on such a day as this, where else should she
                  be? What walls could presume to hold her? Her loveliness was at one with nature's,
                  and they attracted each other. To the solitary nymph, her mighty playmate had been
                  all-sufficient; for she saw not the earth and sky as they appear nowadays to
                  mankind, but the divine meaning which they clothe. Thus she could converse with
                  animals, and could read plants and stones more profoundly than botanist or
                  geologist. She followed inward to her own fresh and beautiful soul the sympathies
                  which allied her to outward things, and found there their true prototypes.</p>
               <p>But when the strong magnetism of a new human spirit began to act upon her, these
                  fine communings with nature suffered disturbance. In such thunderstorms as the
                  meeting of the electric forces must engender, there was need of a trustworthier
                  safeguard than simple perception of a divine purpose underlying creation. Only the
                  personal God is strong enough to govern the relations of soul with soul. Barren of
                  Eve, Adam would not have fallen; but with her, he will one day not only retrieve
                  his fall, but climb to a sublimer height than any to which he could have aspired
                  alone.</p>
               <p>Balder strolled out on the wide lawn. Southwestward wound an avenue of great
                  trees, overshadowing the narrow footpath that stole beneath them. To the right,
                  round the northern corner of the house, he could see far off the white tops of the
                  blossoming apple-trees; and beyond, the river. The orchard perfume came riding on
                  the untamed breeze, and whispered a fragrant secret in the young man's ear.
                  Orchardward he pursued his search.</p>
               <p>As he went on, Gnulemah grew every moment nearer. At length he caught the flutter
                  of her mantle<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6660-00000120"/> amidst the foliage, and
                  presently saw her on the brink of the precipice, looking out across the broad blue
                  river. Thus had he, through his glass, darkly, seen her stand the day before. Were
                  the crossing a river and the flight of a day all that divided his past life from
                  what he thought awaited him now!</p>
               <p>While yet at a distance, he called to her,—not from impatience, but because he
                  stood in awe of the meeting, and wanted the first moments over. His voice touched
                  Gnulemah like a beloved hand, and turned her towards him. Her face, which had not
                  learned to be the mask of emotion, but was instead the full and immediate index
                  thereof, brightened with joy; and as he came near, the joy increased. Yet a
                  seriousness, deep down in her eyes, marked the shadow of a night and the dawn of
                  another day. A spiritual chemistry had been working in her.</p>
               <p>She did not move forward to meet him, but stood delighting in the sense of his
                  ever-growing nearness. When at length he stood close before her, she drew a long,
                  pleasant breath and said,—</p>
               <p>"A beautiful morning!"</p>
               <p>This was no commonplace greeting, for it was not made in a commonplace manner. It
                  said that his coming had consummated the else imperfect beauty of nature, and won
                  its expression from Gnulemah's lips. The commonplace wondered to find itself
                  transmuted into a compliment of fine gold!</p>
               <p>Gnulemah's attire to-day was more Diana-like than yesterday's, and looked as
                  appropriate to her as leaves to trees or clouds to the sky. Her dress, indeed, was
                  not so much a conventional appendage as a living, sensitive part of her, which
                  might be supposed to change its color and style in sympathy with her shifting
                  moods and surroundings, yet never losing certain distinctive traits which had
                  their foundation in her individual nature.</p>
               <p>"A beautiful morning!" returned Balder, taking her hand. "Were you expecting
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"I feared you might not show yourself to me again," she answered, with sudden
                  tears twinkling on her eyelashes. She seemed more tenderly human and approachable
                  to-day than heretofore. Had she found her mountain-height of unmated solitude
                  untenable?—found in herself a yielding woman, and in Balder the strength that is a
                  man? This descent, which was a sweet ascent, made her endlessly more lovable.</p>
               <p>"I come here always when I feel lonely," continued she. "If it had not been for
                  this place, with its great outlook, I should often have been too lonely to stay in
                  the world."</p>
               <p>"We all need an outlook to a larger world, Gnulemah."</p>
               <p>"Besides, you came to me from the other side!" said she, glancing in his face.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6660-00000121"/>
               <p>"Did you see me there?" Balder was on the point of asking; but he was wise enough
                  to refrain. If he could believe it true, let him not tempt his happiness; if faith
                  were weak, why build a barrier against it? So he kept silence.</p>
               <p>"You found my violets!" whispered Gnulemah, with a shy smile. "You understand all
                  I do and am; it is happiness to be with you."</p>
               <p>They sat down by mutual consent beneath a crooked old apple-tree, which yet
                  blossomed as pure and fresh as did the youngest in the orchard. From beneath this
                  white and perfumed tent was a view of the distant city.</p>
               <p>Gnulemah could not be called talkative, yet in giving her thoughts expression she
                  outdid vocabularies. Many fine muscles there were around her eyes, at the corners
                  of her mouth, and especially in the upper lip,—whose subtile curvings and
                  contractions spoke volumes of question, appeal, observation. Her form by its
                  endless shiftings uttered delicate phrases of pleasure, surprise, or love; her
                  hands and fingers were orators, and eloquent were the curlings and tappings of her
                  Arab feet.</p>
               <p>This kind of language would be blank to one used rather to hear words than to feel
                  them; but Balder, in his present exalted mood, delighted in it. Was there any
                  enjoyment more refined than to see his thought, before he had given it breath,
                  lighten in the eyes of this daughter of fire? and with his own eyes to catch the
                  first pure glimmer of her yet unborn fancies? A language genial of intimacy, for
                  the talkers must feel in order to utterance,—must meet each other, from the heart
                  outward, at every point. The human form is made of meanings. It is the full
                  thought of its Creator, comprising all other thoughts. Is it blind chance or
                  lifeless expediency that moulds the curves of woman's bosom, builds up man's
                  forehead like a citadel, and sets his head on his shoulders? Is beauty beautiful,
                  or are we cozened by congenial ugliness? But Balder's philosophic scepticism
                  should never have braved a test like Gnulemah!</p>
               <p>Except music, painting, sculpture,—all the arts and the inspiration of
                  them,—waited on the nib of the pen, such talk as passed between these two could
                  not be written. Some things—and those not the least profound and admirable of
                  life—transcend the cunning of man to interpret them, unless to an apprehension as
                  fine as they! We are fain to content ourselves with the husks.</p>
               <p>"It must be happy there!" said Gnulemah, looking cityward. "So many Balders and
                  Gnulemahs!"</p>
               <p>"Why happy?" asked the man of the world, with a faint smile.</p>
               <p>"We are only two, and have known each other to-day<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000122"/> day and yesterday. But they, you said, are as many
                  as the stars, and have been together many yesterdays."</p>
               <p>Such was the woman's unclinched argument, leaving her listener to draw the
                  inference. He would not forestall her enlightenment from the grim page of his own
                  experience. But do not many pure and loving souls pass through the world without
                  once noticing how bad most of the roads are, and how vexed the climates? So might
                  not the earthly heaven of Gnulemah's imagination tenderly blind her to the
                  unheavenly earth of Balder's knowledge?</p>
               <p>Through his abstraction Balder felt on his hand a touch soft as the flowing of a
                  breath, yet pregnant of indefinite apprehension. When two clouds meet, there is a
                  hush and calm; but the first seeming-trifling lightning-flash brings on the storm
                  whereby earth's face is altered. So Balder, full-charged as the thunder-cloud,
                  awaited fearfully the first vivid word which should light the way for those he had
                  resolved to speak.</p>
               <p>"I see you with my open eyes, Balder, and touch you and hear you. Is this the end
                  I thought would come? Balder, are you greatest?" With full trust she appealed to
                  him to testify concerning himself. This was the seriousness he had marked beneath
                  the smile.</p>
               <p>"Are you content it should be so?"</p>
               <p>She plucked a blade of grass and tied it in a knot, and began, drawing a trembling
                  breath between each few words,—</p>
               <p>"O Balder,—if I must kneel to you as to the last and greatest of all,—if there is
                  nothing too holy to be seen and touched,—if there is no Presence too sublime for
                  me to comprehend—"</p>
               <p>"What then?" asked he, meeting her troubled look with a strong, cheerful
                  glance.</p>
               <p>"Then the world is less beautiful than I thought it; the sun is less bright, and I
                  am no more pleasing to myself." Tears began to flow down her noble cheeks; but
                  Balder's eyes grew brighter, seeing which, Gnulemah was encouraged to
                  continue.</p>
               <p>"How could I be happy? for either must I draw myself apart from you—O Balder!—or
                  else live as your equal, and so degrade you; for I am not a goddess!"</p>
               <p>"Then there are no goddesses on earth,—nor gods! Gnulemah, you need not shrink
                  from me for that."</p>
               <p>The beautiful woman smiled through her sparkling eyelashes. She could love and
                  reverence the man who, as a deity, bewildered and disappointed her. But was the
                  intuition therefore false which had revealed to her the grand conception of a
                  supreme, eternal God?</p>
               <p>They sat silent for a while, and neither looked in the other's face. They had
                  struck a sacred chord, and the sweet, powerful sound thrilled Balder no less
                     than<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6660-00000123"/> Gnulemah. But presently he
                  looked up; his cheeks warmed, and his heart swelled out. He was about to put in
                  jeopardy his most immediate jewel, and the very greatness of the risk gave him
                  courage. Not to the world, that could not judge him righteously, would he confess
                  his crime,—but to the woman he loved and who loved him. Her verdict could not fail
                  to be just and true.</p>
               <p>Could a woman's judgment of her lover be impartial? Yes, if her instincts be pure
                  and harmonious, and her worldly knowledge that of a child. Her discrimination
                  between right and wrong would be at once accurate and involuntary, like the test
                  of poison. Love for the criminal would but sharpen her intuition. The sentence
                  would not be spoken, but would be readable in eyes untainted alike by prejudice or
                  sophistry.</p>
               <p>Gnulemah was thus made the touchstone of Balder's morality. He stood ready to
                  abide by her decision. Her understanding of the case should first be made full;
                  then, if condemned by her look, he would publish his crime to the world, and
                  suffer its penalty. But should her eyes absolve him, then was crime an illusion,
                  evil but undeveloped good, the stain of blood a prejudice, and Cain no outcast,
                  but the venerable forefather of true freedom.</p>
               <p>Unsearchable is the heart of man. Balder had looked forward to condemnation with a
                  wholesome solemnity which cheered while it chastened him. But the thought of
                  acquittal, and at Gnulemah's hands, appalled him. The implicit consequences to
                  humanity seemed more formidable than the worst which condemnation could bring upon
                  himself. So much had he lately changed his point of view, that only the fear of
                  seeing his former creed confirmed could have now availed to stifle his
                  confession.</p>
               <p>But that fear did not much disquiet him; he trusted too deeply in his judge to
                  believe that she would justify it. In short, Gnulemah was in his opinion
                  right-minded, exactly in proportion as she should convict him of being in the
                  wrong. Balder resigned the helm of his vessel, laden as she was with the fruits of
                  years of thought and speculation, at the critical moment of her voyage,—resigned
                  her to the guidance of a woman's unreasoning intuition. He might almost as well
                  have averred that the highest reach of intellect is to a perception of the better
                  worth and wisdom of an unlearned heart.</p>

               <head type="sub">BALDER TELLS AN UNTRUTH.</head>
               <p>BY way of enheartening himself for what he was to do, Balder kissed the posy of
                  Gnulemah's fragrant footsteps. He kept his eyes down, lest she should see
                  something in them to distract her attention from his story. He must go artfully to
                  work,—gain her assent to the abstract principles before marshalling them against
                  himself.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Gnulemah had picked up a gold beetle, and was examining it with a
                  certain grave interest.</p>
               <p>"I never told you how I came by this ring of Hiero's. It was the night before I
                  first saw you, Gnulemah."</p>
               <p>"The ring guided you to me!" said she, glancing at his downcast visage.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it did!" he muttered, struck by the ingenious superstition; and he eyed
                  the keen diamond half suspiciously. How fiercely the little serpents were
                  struggling for it! "But Hiero—he has lost it, and you will see him no more!"</p>
               <p>"You are with me!" returns she, shining out at him from beneath her level brows.
                  What should she know of death and parting?</p>
               <p>Balder still forbore to raise his face. Gnulemah was in a frolicsome humor, the
                  reaction of her foregoing solemnity. But Balder, who deemed this hour the gravest
                  of his life, was taken aback by her unseasonable gayety. Casting about for means
                  to sober her,—an ungracious thing for a lover to do!—he hit upon the gold
                  beetle.</p>
               <p>"Dead; the poor little beetle! Do you know what death is, Gnulemah?"</p>
               <p>"It is what makes life. The sun dies every night, to get life for the morning. And
                  trees die when cold comes, so as to smile out in green leaves again,—greener than
                  if there had been no death. So it is with all things."</p>
               <p>"Not with everything," said Balder, taking her light-heartedness very gravely.
                  "That gold beetle in your hand is dead, and will never live or move again."</p>
               <p>But at that Gnulemah smiled; and bringing her hand, with the beetle in it, near
                  her perfect lips, she lent it a full warm breath,—enough to have enlivened an
                  Egyptian scarabæus,—and behold! the beetle spread its wings and whizzed away.
                  Before Balder could recover from this unexpected refutation, the lovely witch
                  followed up her advantage.</p>
               <p>"You thought, perhaps, that Hiero was as dead as<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000125"/> the little beetle; but he lives more beautifully in
                  you!"</p>
               <p>He looked startled up, his large eyes glittering blackly in the paleness of his
                  face. Gnulemah, with the serenity of a victorious disputant willing to make
                  allowances, continued,—</p>
               <p>"It may be different in the outside world from which you come; but here death ends
                  nothing, but makes life new and strong."</p>
               <p>After a silence of some duration, poor Balder renewed his attack from another
                  quarter.</p>
               <p>"What would you think of one who put to death a creature you loved?"</p>
               <p>She smiled, and shook her glowing pendants.</p>
               <p>"Only God puts to death; and no one would hurt a thing I love!"</p>
               <p>"What should you think of one who put to death a man?"</p>
               <p>Gnulemah looked for a moment perplexed and indignant. Then, to Balder's great
                  discomfiture, she laughed like a bird-chorus.</p>
               <p>"Why do you imagine what cannot be? Would you and Hiero kill each other? The gray
                  owl kills little mice, but that is to eat them. Would you eat Hiero—"</p>
               <p>"Don't laugh, Gnulemah!" besought he. "I should kill him, not as animals kill one
                  another, but from rage and hatred."</p>
               <p>"Hatred!" repeated Gnulemah, dislikingly; "hatred,—what is it?"</p>
               <p>"A passion of men's hearts,—the wish that evil may befall others. When the hatred
                  is bitter enough, and the opportunity fair, they kill!"</p>
               <p>Gnulemah shuddered slightly and looked sad. Then she leaned towards Balder and
                  touched his shoulder persuasively.</p>
               <p>"Never think of such things, or talk of them! Could you hate any one, Balder? or
                  kill him if you did?"</p>
               <p>With that glorious presence so near him,—her voice so close to his ear,—how could
                  he answer her? His heart awoke, and beat and drove the tingling blood tumultuously
                  forth to the remotest veins. She saw the flush, and caught the passionate
                  brilliancy of his eyes. Happy and afraid, she drew back, saying in haste,—</p>
               <p>"You have not told me yet about the ring!"</p>
               <p>That was not wisely said! Balder checked himself with a sudden, strong hand, and
                  held still,—his brows lowered down and his lips settled together,—until his pulses
                  were quiet and his cheeks once more pale.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," he said; "but to understand, you must first hear some other
                  things." He hesitated, face to face with an analysis of murder. The position was
                  at once stimulating and appalling. To dissect and reduce to its elements that
                  grisly murder-devil which had once possessed his own soul, and whose writhings<pb
                     n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6660-00000126"/> beneath the scalpel he would therefore
                  feel as his own,—here loomed a prospect large and terrible! Nevertheless, Balder
                  took up the knife.</p>
               <p>The white petal of an apple-blossom, parting from its calyx, came floating
                  earthwards; but a breeze caught it and wafted it aloft. It sank again, and was
                  again arrested and borne skywards. Finally it disappeared over the cliff-edge.</p>
               <p>"The weight that made it fall is of the earth," said Balder (both he and Gnulemah
                  had been watching the petal's course). "The breeze that buoyed it up was from
                  heaven, and so it is with man. Were there no heavenly support, he would fall at
                  once, but whether or not, he always tends to fall."</p>
               <p>Gnulemah objected, "It loves the air better than the earth!"</p>
               <p>"When man begins to fall, he becomes mad, and thinks he is not falling, but that
                  earth is heaven, to which he is rising. But since earth is not like heaven,
                  infinite, he does not wish others to enjoy it, lest his own pleasure be
                  marred."</p>
               <p>"How can that be?" said the unwilling Gnulemah.</p>
               <p>"What can make men so happy on earth as other men?"</p>
               <p>"Each wants all power for himself," rejoined Balder, his voice growing stern as he
                  pursued his theme.</p>
               <p>"They want to hurl their fellows out of the world, even to annihilation. Every
                  moment this hatred is let grow in the heart's garden, it spreads and strengthens,
                  till it gains dominion and makes men slaves, and madder than before. Each will be
                  above his rival,—his enemy! he will be absolute master over him. And from that
                  resolve is born murder!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you tell Gnulemah this?" she asked, lifting her head like a majestic
                  serpent. But she could not stop him now. His voice, measured at first, was now
                  driven by emotion.</p>
               <p>"Murder comes next; and many a man, had fear or impotence not withheld him, would
                  have done a thousand times. But sometimes the demon leaps up and masters impotence
                  and fear. The man is drunk with immeasurable selfishness,—greater than the
                  universe can satisfy; which would fain make one victim after another, till all the
                  human race should be destroyed; and then would it turn against Heaven and God.
                  Save for man's mortal frailty, the population of the world would ever and anon be
                  swept away by some giant murderer.</p>
               <p>"Wickedness grows faster, the wickeder it is; he who has been wicked once will
                  easily be so again,—the more easily as his crime was great. Even though through
                  all his mortal life he sin no more, yet his drift is thitherward! Only the air of
                  Heaven breathing through his soul after death can make him pure."</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6660-00000127"/>
               <p>Balder was speaking out all the gloom and terror which had been silently gathering
                  within him since his fatal night. As he spoke, his mind expanded, and perceived
                  things before unknown. As the reasons for condemnation multiplied, he did but push
                  on the harder, striking at each tender spot in his own armor. And as the day
                  turned fatally against him, his face looked great and heroic, and his voice
                  sounded almost triumphant.</p>
               <p>Thus far, he had only generalized; now, he was come to his own plight. On several
                  points he had been painfully in doubt: whether he had done the deed in
                  self-defence; whether he had meant to do it; whether it had not been a blind, mad
                  accident, since swollen by fevered imagination into the likeness of wilful crime.
                  But against such doubts arrayed itself the ineffaceable memory of that wild joy
                  which had filled his soul, when he had felt his enemy in his power! Had the man
                  survived, Balder might still have doubted; being dead, doubts were but cowardly
                  sophistry.</p>
               <p>But during the brief pause he made, came a backward recoil of that impulse which
                  had swept him on. All at once he was cold, and wavered. Gnulemah was sitting with
                  her elbow on her knee, her strange eyes fixed upon him. Had he duly considered
                  what effect all this might have on her? In aiming at his own life, might not the
                  sword pass also through hers? Abruptly to behold sin,—to find in the first man she
                  had learnt to know, the sinner,—to be left with this burden on her untried
                  soul,—might this not ruin more than her earthly happiness? Did she still love him,
                  such love could end only in misery; should she hate him who of all men was bound
                  to protect her defencelessness,—that were misery indeed!</p>
               <p>This misgiving, arresting his hand at the instant of delivering the final blow,
                  almost discouraged the much-tried man. He glanced sullenly toward the edge of the
                  cliff, only a few yards off. A new thought jarred through his nerves! He got up
                  and walked to the brink. Full sixty feet to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Gnulemah also rose slowly, and stretched herself like a tired child, sending a
                  lazy tension through every noble limb and polished muscle. She sighed with a deep
                  breathing in and out, and pressed her hands against her temples.</p>
               <p>"I was not made to understand such things. Tell me of what you have done or
                  seen,—I shall understand that. The things my love does not enter only trouble me
                  and make me sad."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she turned away towards the house. She saw, or thought she saw, a
                  man's figure stealing cautiously behind a clump of bushes near the northeastern<pb
                     n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6660-00000128"/> eastern corner. Her listlessness fell
                  from her like a mantle, and she watched, motionless!</p>
               <p>Her last words had goaded Balder past bearing. As she turned away, his face looked
                  grim and forlorn. He balanced with half-raised arms on the cliff's brink. The
                  river slumbered bluely on below, peace was loft in the sky, and joy in the trees
                  and grass. But in the man were darkness and despair and loathing of his God-given
                  life!</p>
               <p>The thing he meditated was not to be, however. Close in shore a little boat glided
                  into view, beating up against stream. In the stern, the sheet in one hand and the
                  tiller in the other, sat Balder's old friend Charon. He nodded up at the young man
                  with a recognizing grin. Then he laid his tiller-hand aside his brown cheek and
                  sang out,—</p>
               <p>"Look out there, Capt'n! Davy Jones's got back,—run foul of you!"</p>
               <p>The next moment he put down the helm and ran out.</p>
               <p>Meantime Balder, coloring from shame, had stepped back from his dangerous
                  position; and the peril was past. But the paltering irresolution which he had at
                  all points displayed urged him to redeem himself,—else was he lower than a
                  criminal. He went towards Gnulemah,—knelt down,—caught her dress,—he knew not what
                  he did! In a blind dance of sentences he told her that he was a murderer, that all
                  he had said pointed at himself, that with his own hands he had killed Hiero, whose
                  body now lay at the bottom of the sea; many frantic words he spoke. Thus, without
                  art or rhetoric, roughly dragged forth by head and ears, came his momentous
                  confession into the world. Gnulemah had more than once striven to check it, but in
                  vain. When he had come to an end, and stood tense and quivering as a bowstring
                  whose arrow has just flown, these words reached him:—</p>
               <p>"Hiero is not dead; he is there behind the trees."</p>
               <p>Stiffly he turned and stared bewildered. Landscape, sky, Gnulemah, swam before his
                  eyes in fragments, like images in troubled water. She put out her arm and tenderly
                  supported him.</p>
               <p>"Where?" said he at length.</p>
               <p>"Near the house,—there!" she pointed.</p>
               <p>Balder began to walk forward doubtfully. But, suddenly realizing what lay before
                  him, clearness and vigor ebbed back. He saw a figure turn the corner of the house.
                  Then he leapt out and ran like a stag-hound!</p>

               <head>XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">UNCLE HIERO AT LAST.</head>
               <p>IN a couple of minutes Balder was at the house, breathless: the figure was nowhere
                  to be seen. He sprang across the broad portico, and hurried with sounding feet
                  through the oaken hall. Should he go up stairs, or on to the conservatory? The
                  sound of a softly shutting door from the latter direction decided him. The place
                  looked as when he left it a half-hour before. Gnulemah's curtain had not been
                  moved. The other door was closed; he ran up the steps between the granite
                  sphinxes, and found it locked. Butting his shoulder against the panel with
                  impatient force, the hinges broke from their rotten fastenings, and the door gave
                  inwards. Balder stepped past it, and found himself in the sombre lamp-lit interior
                  of the granite temple.</p>
               <p>He could discern but little; the place seemed vast; the corners were veiled in
                  profound shadow. At the farther end a huge lamp was suspended, by a chain from the
                  roof, over a triangular altar of black marble. The architecture of the room was
                  strange and massive, as of Egyptian temples. Strong, dark colors met the eye on
                  all sides; in the panels of the walls and distant ceiling fantastic devices showed
                  obscurely forth. Nine mighty columns, of design like those in the doorway, were
                  ranged along the walls, their capitals buried in the upward gloom.</p>
               <p>Becoming used to the dusk, Balder now marked an array of colossal upright forms,
                  alternating between the pillars. Their rough resemblance to human figures drew him
                  towards one of them: it was an Egyptian sarcophagus covered with hieroglyphic
                  inscriptions, and probably holding an immemorial mass of spiced flesh and rags.
                  These silent relics of a prehistoric past seemed to be the only company present.
                  In view of his uncle's well-known tastes, the nephew was not unprepared to meet
                  these gentry.</p>
               <p>But he was come to seek the living, not the dead. The figure that he had seen
                  outside must be within these four walls, there being no other visible outlet
                  besides the door through which Balder had entered. Was old Hiero Glyphic lurking
                  in one of these darksome corners, or behind some thick-set column? The young man
                  looked about him as sharply as he could, but nothing moved except the shadows
                  thrown by the lamp, which was vibrating pendulum-like on its long chain.</p>
               <p>He approached this lamp, his steps echoing on the<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000130"/> floor of polished granite. What had set the thing
                  swinging? It had a leisurely elliptical motion, as from a moderate push sideways.
                  The lamp was wrought in bronze, antique of fashion and ornament. It had capacity
                  for gallons of oil, and would burn for weeks without refilling. The altar beneath
                  was a plain black marble prism, highly polished, resting upon a round base of
                  alabaster. A handful of ashes crowned its top. Between the altar and the wall
                  intervened a space of about seven feet.</p>
               <p>The glare of the lamp had blinded Balder to what was beyond it; but, on stepping
                  round it, he was confronted by an old-fashioned upright clock, such as were in
                  vogue upon staircase-landings and in entrance-halls a hundred years ago. With its
                  broad, white dial-plate, high shoulders, and dark mahogany case, it looked not
                  unlike a tall, flat-featured man, holding himself stiffly erect. But whether man
                  or clock, it was lifeless; the hands were motionless,—there was no sound of human
                  or mechanical heart-beat within, though Balder held his yet panting breath to
                  listen! Was it Time's coffin, wherein his corpse had lain for many a silent
                  year,—only that years must stand still without Time to drive them on! But this
                  still hall had no part in the moving world,—knew naught of life and change, day
                  and night. Here dwelt a moveless present,—a present at once past and to come, yet
                  never here! No wonder the mummies felt at home! though even they could only
                  partially appreciate the situation.</p>
               <p>The clock was fastened against the wall. The longer Balder gazed at it, the more
                  human-like did it appear. Its face was ornamented with colored pictures of
                  astronomical processes, sufficiently resembling a set of shadowy features, of a
                  depressed and insignificant type. The mahogany case served for a close-fitting
                  brown surtout, buttoned to the chin. The slow vibration of the lamp produced on
                  the countenance the similitude of a periodically recurring grimace.</p>
               <p>Not only did the clock look human, but—or so Balder fancied—it bore a grotesque
                  and extravagant likeness to a certain elderly relative of his, whose portrait he
                  had carried in an inner pocket of his haversack,—now in Long Island Sound. It
                  reminded him, in a word, of poor old Uncle Hiero, whom he had—no, no!—who was
                  alive and well, and was perhaps even now observing his dear nephew's perplexity,
                  and maliciously chuckling over it!</p>
               <p>The young man glanced uneasily over his shoulder, but all beyond the lamp was a
                  gloomy blank. The same moment he trod upon some tough, thick substance, which
                  yielded beneath his foot! Thoroughly startled, he jumped back. It lay near the
                  foot of the clock. He stooped, picked it up, and<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000131"/> held in his hands the well-known haversack, from
                  which he had parted on board the "Empire State." How his heart beat as he examined
                  it! It was stained and whitened with salt water, and the strap was broken in two.
                  Opening it, there were his toilet articles and all his other treasures,—even the
                  cherished miniature,—not much the worse for their wetting. So there could no
                  longer be any doubt that his uncle had come back. Where was he?</p>
               <p>That queer fancy about the clock stuck in Balder's head! Somehow or other it must
                  be connected with Doctor Glyphic. The haversack, dropped at its foot, was direct
                  evidence. Yet, did ever wise man harbor notion so irrational! Its manifest
                  absurdity was the only excuse for thinking it.</p>
               <p>With no declared object in view, Balder grasped the clock by its high shoulders
                  and shook it, but with no result. He next struck the mahogany smartly with
                  clenched fist: the blow sounded,—not hollow, but close and muffled! The case must
                  be either solid, or filled with something that deadened the echo. Filled with
                  what? who would think of putting anything in a clock? It was big enough, to be
                  sure, to hold a man, if he could find a way to get in!</p>
               <p>The sequence of thoughts is often obscure, but Balder's next idea, wild as it was,
                  could hardly be called incoherent. A man might be conceived to be in the clock;
                  perhaps a man was in it; but if so, the man could be none other than Doctor Hiero
                  Glyphic!</p>
               <p>This conclusion once imagined, suspense was unendurable. The logician tried to
                  open the front of the case, but it was riveted fast. With impetuous fingers he
                  then wrenched at the disc. With a sound like a rusty screech, it came off in his
                  hands. The lamp so flickered that Balder feared it was going out, and even at this
                  epoch had to look round to reassure himself. Meanwhile, a pungent, but not
                  unpleasant odor saluted his nostrils: he turned back to the clock,—a clock no
                  longer!—and beheld the unmistakable lineaments of his worthy uncle peeping forth
                  with half-shut eyes from the place where the dial-plate had been.</p>
               <p>The nephew dropped the dial-plate, and it was shattered on the granite floor. He
                  was badly frightened. There was no delusion about the face,—it was a sufficiently
                  peculiar one; and the miniature portrait, though doing the Doctor's beauty at
                  least justice, was accurate enough to identify him by. This was no unsubstantial
                  apparition,—no brain phantom, to waver and vanish, leaving only an uncomfortable
                  doubt whether it had been at all. Stolid, undeniable matter it was, peering
                  phlegmatically between its wrinkled eyelids.</p>
               <p>But admitting that now, at last, we have lighted<pb n="262-263"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000132"/> upon the genuine and authentic Doctor Glyphic, why
                  should the sight of him so oddly affect Balder Helwyse, whose avowed object in
                  pulling off the dial-plate had been to justify a suspicion that Uncle Hiero was
                  behind it? Why, moreover, did the young man not address his relative,
                  congratulating himself upon their meeting, and rallying the old gentleman on his
                  attempt to escape his nephew's affectionate solicitude? There had, indeed, been a
                  misunderstanding at their last encounter, and Balder had so far forgotten himself
                  as to throw Hiero into the sea; but it was the part of good-breeding, as well as
                  of Christianity, to forget such errors, and heal the bruise with an extra
                  application of balsamic verbiage.</p>
               <p>Why so speechless, Balder? Do you wait for your host to speak first? Nay, never
                  stand on ceremony. He is an eccentric recluse, unused to the ways of society,
                  while a man of the world like you has at his tongue's tip a score of phrases just
                  suited to the occasion. Speak up, therefore, in your most genial tone, and tell
                  the Doctor how glad you are to find him in such wonderful preservation! Put him at
                  his ease by feigning that his position appears to you the most natural in the
                  world,—just what befits a gentleman of his years and honors! Flatter him, if only
                  from self-interest, for he has a deep pocket, and may be induced to let you put a
                  hand in it.</p>
               <p>Not a word in response to all this eloquence, Balder? Positively your behavior
                  appears rather curmudgeonly than heroic! You stand gazing at your relative with
                  almost as much fixedness as he returns your stare withal. There is something odd
                  about this.</p>
               <p>What is that pungent odor? Is the Doctor a dandy, that he should use perfumes? And
                  where did he get so peculiar a scent as this? It is commonly in vogue only at that
                  particular toilet which no man ever performed for himself, but which never needs
                  to be done twice,—a kind of toilet, by the way, especially prevalent amongst the
                  ancient Egyptians. Since, then, Doctor Glyphic is so ardent an Egyptologist,
                  perhaps we have hit upon the secret of his remarkable odoriferousness. But to shut
                  one's self up in a box that looks so uncommonly like a coffin,—is not that
                  carrying the antiquarian whim a trifle too far?</p>
               <p>This face of his,—one fancies there is a curiously dry look about it! The
                  unnaturally yellow skin resembles a piece of good-for-nothing wrinkled parchment.
                  The lips partake of the prevailing sallow tint, and the mouth hangs a little awry.
                  From the cloth in which the head is so elaborately bandaged up strays forth, here
                  and there, an arid lock of hair. The lack of united expression in his features
                  produces an effect seldom observable in a living face. The eyes are lustreless,
                  and densely black; or possibly (the suspicion<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000133"/> picion is a startling one) we are looking into
                  empty eye-sockets! No eyes, no expression, parchment skin, swathed head, odor of
                  myrrh and cassia, and, dominating all, this ghastly immobility! Has Doctor Glyphic
                  even now escaped, leaving us to waste time and sentiment over some worn-out
                  disguise of his? Nay, if he be not here, we need not seek him further. Having
                  forsaken this, he can attain no other earthly hiding-place. We must pause here,
                  and believe either that this dry time-husk is the very last of poor Hiero, or that
                  a living being which once bore his name has vanished inward from our reach, and
                  now treads a more real earth than any that time and space are sovereign over.</p>
               <p>Balder (whose perceptions were unlimited by artistic requirements) probably needed
                  no second glance to assure him that his uncle was a mummy of many years' standing.
                  But no effort of mental gymnastics could explain him the fact. Were this real,
                  then was his steamboat adventure a dream, the revelation of the ring a delusion,
                  and his water-stained haversack a phantom. He wandered clewless in a maze of
                  mystery. Nor was this the first paradox he had encountered since overleaping the
                  brick wall. He began to question whether supernaturalism had not been too hastily
                  dismissed by lovers of wisdom!</p>
               <p>Thus do the actors in the play of life plod from one to another scene, nor once
                  rise to a height whence a glance might survey past and future. Memory and prophecy
                  are twin sisters,—nay, they are essentially one muse, whom mankind worships on
                  this side and slights on that. This is well, for had she but one aspect, the world
                  would be either too confident or too helpless. But in reviewing a life, one is apt
                  to make less than due allowance for the helplessness. Thus it is no prejudice to
                  Balder's intellectual acumen that he failed for a moment to penetrate the thin
                  disguises of events, and to perceive relations obvious to the comprehensive view
                  of history. We will take advantage of his bewildered pause to draw attention to
                  some matters heretofore neglected.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HAPPINESS OF MAN.</head>
               <p>WHEN Manetho,—who shall no longer perplex us with his theft of a worthier man's
                  name,—when Manetho felt himself worsted in the brief strenuous struggle, he tried
                  to drag his antagonist overboard with him. But his convulsive fingers seized only
                  the leathern strap of the haversack. Balder—his Berserker fury at white heat—flung
                  the man with such terrible strength as drove him headlong over the taff-rail like
                  a billet of wood, the stout strap snapping like thread!</p>
               <p>Manetho struck the water in sorry plight, breathless, bruised, half strangled. He
                  sank to a chilly depth, but carried his wits down with him, and these brought him
                  up again alive, however exhausted. Too weak to swim, he yet had strength left to
                  keep afloat. But for the collision, he had drowned, after all!</p>
               <p>The cool salt bath presently helped him to a little energy, and by the time the
                  steamer was under way, he could think of striking out. It was with no small relief
                  that he heard near voices sounding through the black fog. Partly by dint of feeble
                  struggles, partly shouldered on by waves,—ready to save as to drown him,—he
                  managed to accomplish the short distance to the schooner. With all his might he
                  shouted for a rope, and amidst much yo-heave-ho-ing, cursing, and astonishment,
                  was at length hauled aboard, the haversack in his grasp.</p>
               <p>The skipper and his crew were kind to him; for men still have compassion upon one
                  another, and give succor according to the need of the moment,—not to the balance
                  of good and evil in the sufferer. The wind freshened, an impromptu bowsprit was
                  rigged, and the "Resurrection" limped towards New York. Manetho's partial stupor
                  was relieved by hot grog and the cook's stove. He gave no further account of
                  himself than that he had fallen overboard at the moment of collision; adding a
                  request to be landed in New York, since he had left some valuable luggage on the
                  steamer.</p>
               <p>The skipper gave the stranger his own bunk, the off-watch turned in, and Manetho
                  was left to himself. He lay for a long while thinking over what had happened.
                  Bewitched by the spell of night, he had spoken to Helwyse things never before
                  distinctly stated even to his own mind. The subtle, perverse devil who had
                  discoursed so freely to his unknown hearer had scarcely been so unreserved to
                     Manetho's<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6660-00000135"/> private ear; and the
                  devilish utterances had stirred up the latter not much less than the former.</p>
               <p>Both men had been wrought, according to their diverse natures, to the pitch of
                  frenzy. But similar crazy seizures had been incident to the Egyptian from boyhood.
                  He had anxiously watched against them, and contrived various means to their
                  mitigation,—the most successful being the music of his violin, which he seldom let
                  beyond his reach. Yet, again and again would the fit steal a march on him. Hence,
                  in part, his retired way of life, varied only by the brief journeys demanded by
                  the twofold craving—for gambling and for news of Thor, who figured in his morbid
                  imagination as the enemy of his soul!</p>
               <p>The news never came, but all the more brooded Manetho over his hatred and his
                  fancied wrongs. His mind had never been entirely sound, and years tinged it more
                  and more deeply with insanity. His philosophy of life—obscure indeed if tried by
                  sane standards—emits a dusky glimmer when read by this. He would creep through
                  miles of subterranean passages to achieve an end which one glance above ground
                  would have argued vain!</p>
               <p>Lying on the bunk in the close cabin, lighted by a dirty lantern pendent from the
                  roof, the Reverend Manetho began to fear that not his worst misfortune was the
                  having been thrown overboard. At the moment when madness was smouldering to a
                  blaze within him, the lantern flash had revealed to him the face which, for twenty
                  years, he had seen in visions. Often had he rehearsed this meeting, varying his
                  imaginary behavior to suit all conceivable moods and attitudes of his enemy, but
                  never thinking to provide for perversity in himself! So far from veiling his
                  designs with the soft-voiced cunning of his Oriental nature, he had been a wild
                  beast! A misgiving haunted him, moreover, that he had babbled something in the
                  false security of darkness, which might give Helwyse a clew to his secret.</p>
               <p>But here Manetho asked himself a question that might have suggested itself before.
                  Was it really his enemy, Thor Helwyse, whose face he had seen? or only some
                  likeness of him?</p>
               <p>Thor must be threescore years old by this,—the senior by ten years of Manetho
                  himself; while his late antagonist had the strength and aspect of half that age.
                  Yet how could he be mistaken in the face which had haunted him during more than
                  the third part of his lifetime? He had recognized it on the instant!</p>
               <p>"I will ask the haversack!" said he. He sat up, and, bracing himself against the
                  roll of the vessel, he opened the bag and carefully examined its contents<pb
                     n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6660-00000136"/> tents. In an inner pocket he found an
                  old letter of Doctor Glyphic's to Thor; another from Thor to his son, dated three
                  years back; and finally a diary kept by Balder Helwyse, which gave Manetho all the
                  information he wanted.</p>
               <p>He had so arranged matters that at Glyphic's death he had got the control of the
                  money into his own hands, and had made such diligent use of it that enough was not
                  now left to pay for his prosecution as a thief and forger. In fact, had Balder
                  delayed his return another year, he would have found the enchanted castle in
                  possession of the auctioneer; and as to the fate of its inhabitants, one does not
                  like to speculate!</p>
               <p>Having read the papers, Manetho replaced them, and next pulled out the miniature
                  of Doctor Glyphic. He studied this for a long time. It was the portrait of a man
                  to whom—so long as their earthly relations had continued—the Egyptian renegade had
                  been faithful. Perhaps there was some secret germ of excellence in poor Hiero,
                  unsuspected by the rest of the world, but revealed to Manetho, from whom in turn
                  it had drawn the best virtues that his life had to show. Doctor Glyphic had never
                  been a comfortable companion; but Manetho was always patient and honest with him.
                  This integrity and forbearance were the more remarkable, since the Doctor seldom
                  acknowledged edged a kindness, and knew so little of business that he might have
                  been robbed of his fortune at any moment with impunity.</p>
               <p>Either from physical exhaustion or for some worthier reason, the Egyptian cried
                  over this miniature, as an affectionate girl might have cried over the portrait of
                  her dead lover. For a time he was all tears and softness. His emotion had not the
                  convulsiveness which, with men of his age, is apt to accompany the exhibition of
                  much feeling. He wept with feminine fluency, nor did his tearfulness seem out of
                  character. There was a great deal of the woman in him.</p>
               <p>Having wept his fill, he tenderly wiped his eyes, and returned the picture to its
                  receptacle; and first assuring himself that nothing else was concealed in the
                  haversack, he shut it up and resumed his meditations.</p>
               <p>It was the son, then, whom he had met,—and Thor was dead. Dead!—that was a hard
                  fact for Manetho to swallow. His enemy had escaped him,—was dead! Through all the
                  years of waiting, Manetho had not anticipated this. How should Thor die before
                  revenge had been wreaked upon him?—But he was dead!</p>
               <p>By degrees, however, his mind began to adjust itself to the situation. The son, at
                  all events, was left him. He cuddled the thought, whispering to himself and slyly
                  smiling. Did not the father live again in the son? he would lose nothing;
                  therefore,—not lose, but<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6660-00000137"/> gain! The
                  seeming loss was a blessing in disguise. The son,—young, handsome, hot of blood!
                  Already new schemes began to take shape in the Egyptian's brain. His dear
                  revenge!—it should not starve, but feed on the fat of the land,—yea, be drunk with
                  strong wine.</p>
               <p>He lay hugging himself, his long narrow eyes gleaming, his full lips working
                  together. He was revolving a devilish project,—the flintiest criminal might have
                  shuddered at it. But there was nothing flinty nor unfeeling about Manetho. His
                  emotions were alert and moist, his smile came and went, his heart beat full; he
                  was now the girl listening to her lover's first passionate declaration!</p>
               <p>He had gathered from Balder's diary that the young man was in search of his uncle,
                  and had been on his way to the house at the time of their encounter. There was a
                  chance that this unlucky episode might frighten him away. He no doubt supposed
                  himself guilty of manslaughter at least; how gladly would the clergyman have
                  reassured him! And indeed there was no resentment in Manetho's heart because of
                  his rough usage at Balder's hands. His purposes lay too deep to influence
                  shallower moods. He presented a curious mixture of easy forgiveness and
                  unmitigable malice.</p>
               <p>The only other anxiety besetting him arose from the loss of the ring. He looked
                  upon it as a talisman of excellent virtue, and moreover perceived that in case
                  Balder should pick it up, it might become the means of identifying its owner and
                  obstructing his plans. But these were mere contingencies. The probability was that
                  young Helwyse would ultimately appear at his uncle's house, and would there be
                  ensnared in the seductive meshes of Manetho's web. The ring was most likely at the
                  bottom of the Sound. So, smiling his subtle feminine smile, the Egyptian fell
                  asleep, to dream of the cordial welcome he would give his expected guest.</p>
               <p>Towards midnight of the same day he approaches the house by way of the winding
                  avenue, his violin-case safe in hand. He steps out joyfully beneath the widespread
                  minuet of twinkling stars. On his way he comes to a moss-grown bench at the foot
                  of a mighty elm,—the bench on which he sat with Helen during the stirring moments
                  of their last interview. Manetho's soul overflows to-night with flattering hopes,
                  and he has spare emotion for any demand. He drops on his knees beside this decayed
                  old bench, and kisses it twice or thrice with tender vehemence; stretches out his
                  arms to embrace the air, and ripples forth a half-dozen sentences,—pleading,
                  insinuating, passionate. He can love her again as much as ever, now that the wrong
                  done him is on the eve of requital.</p>
               <p>But his mood is no less fickle than melting. Already<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000138"/> ready he is up and away, almost dancing along the
                  shadowed, romantic tree-aisle, his eyes glistening black in the starlight,—no
                  longer with a lover's luxurious sorrow, but with the happy anticipation of an
                  artless child, promised a holiday and playthings. So lightsome and expansive is
                  Manetho's heart, the hollow hemisphere of heaven seems none too roomy for it!</p>
               <p>Evil as well as good knows its moments of bliss,—its hours! Hell is the heaven of
                  devils, and they want no better. Often do the wages of sin come laden with a
                  seeming blessing that those of virtue lack. The sinner looks upon Satan's face,
                  and it is to him as the face of God!</p>
               <p>But from the womb of this grim truth is born a noble consolation. Were hell mere
                  torment, and joy in heaven only, where were the good man's merit? Only when the
                  choice lies between two heavens—the selfish and the unselfish—is the battle worthy
                  the fighting! No human soul dies from earth that attains not heaven,—that heaven
                  which the heart chiefly sought while in this world; and herefrom is the genesis of
                  virtue. Sin brings its self-inflicted penalties there as here; but hell is still
                  the happiness of man, heaven of God!</p>
               <p>Reaching the house, Manetho passed through the open door, crossed the hall with
                  his customary noiselessness, and entered the conservatory. Despite the darkness,
                  he was at once aware of the motionless group beneath the palm-trees. A stranger in
                  the house was something so unprecedented that he could not repress a throb of
                  alarm. Nurse looked up and beckoned him. Drawing near, he heard the long, deep
                  breathing of the sleeper. With a sudden fore-glimpse of the truth, he knelt down,
                  and bent over the upturned countenance.</p>
               <p>Though the beard was close-shaven and the hair cropped short, there could be no
                  doubt about the face. His guest had come before him, and was lying defenceless at
                  his feet; but Manetho harbored no thought of violence. He pressed his slender
                  hands together with an impulse of sympathy. "Poor fellow!" he whispered, "how he
                  has suffered! How the horror of blood-guiltiness must have tortured him! The noble
                  Helwyse hair,—all gone! Too dear a price to pay for the mere sacrifice of a human
                  life! And pain and all might have been spared him,—poor fellow! poor fellow!"
                  Manetho lacked but little of shedding true tears over the evidence of his dearest
                  foe's useless dread and anguish. Did he wish Balder to bring undulled nerves to
                  his own torture-chamber?</p>
               <p>His lament over, Manetho turned to Nurse for such information regarding the
                  guest's arrival and behavior as she might have to communicate. Of his own affair
                  with Balder he made no mention. The conversation<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000139"/> was carried on by signs, according to a code long
                  since grown up between the two. When the tale was told, Nurse was despatched to
                  make ready Helen's room for the new-comer, and thither did the two laboriously
                  bear him, and laid him, still sleeping, on his mother's bed.</p>

               <head>XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">MUSIC AND MADNESS.</head>
               <p>BEFORE leaving Balder to his repose, Manetho paused to regain his breath, and to
                  throw a glance round the room. It was a place he seldom visited. He had seen
                  Helen's dead body lie on that bed, and the sight had bred in him an animosity
                  against the chamber and everything it contained. After Doctor Glyphic's death he
                  had gratified this feeling in a characteristic manner. Possessing a genius for
                  drawing second only to that for music, he had exercised it on the walls of the
                  room, originally modelled and tinted to represent a robin's egg. He mixed his
                  colors with the bitter distillations of his heart, and created the beautiful but
                  ill-omened vision which long afterwards so disquieted Balder.—</p>
               <p>From the chamber he now repaired to the kitchen, which was in some respects the
                  most attractive place in the house. The smoky ceiling; the cavernous cupboards
                  opening into the walls; the stanch dressers, polished by use and mottled with many
                  an ancient stain; the great black range, which would have cooked a meal for a<pb
                     n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6660-00000140"/> troop of men-at-arms,—all spoke of
                  homely human comfort. Nurse had Manetho's meal ready for him, and, having set it
                  out on the table, she retired to her position in the chimney-corner. The
                  Egyptian's spare body was ordinarily nourished with little more than goes to the
                  support of an Arab, and Nurse's monotonous life must have been unfavorable to
                  large appetite. As for Gnulemah,—although young women are said to thrive and grow
                  beautiful on a diet of morning dew, noonday sunshine, and evening mist,—it seems
                  quite likely that she ate no less than the health and activity of a Diana might
                  naturally require.</p>
               <p>Manetho made a gleeful repast, and Nurse looked on from her corner, externally as
                  unattractive-looking a woman as one would wish to see. Nevertheless, had she been
                  made as some clocks are, with a plate of glass over her inner movements, she would
                  have monopolized the clergyman's attention and impaired his appetite. He did not
                  sit down to the table, but took up one viand after another, and ate as he walked
                  to and fro the floor. Supper over, he crowned it with an unheard-of excess,—for
                  Manetho was commonly a very temperate man. He brought from a cupboard a dusty
                  bottle of priceless wine, which had once enriched the cellar of a king of Spain.
                  Drawing the cork, he poured some of the golden liquor into a slender glass, while
                  the spiritual aroma flowed invisible along the air, visiting every darksome nook,
                  and even saluting Nurse, who had long been a stranger to any such delicate
                  attention.</p>
               <p>Manetho filled two glasses, and then beckoned Nurse to come from her corner, and
                  drink with him. Forth she hobbled accordingly, looking more than usually ugly by
                  reason of her surprise and embarrassment at the unexpected summons. Manetho, on
                  the other hand, seemed to have cast aside his years, and to be once more the
                  graceful, sinuous, courteous youth, whose long black eyes had, long ago, seen
                  Salome's heart. With an elegant gesture he handed her the brimming wineglass,
                  accompanying it with a smile which wellnigh shook it from between her fingers. He
                  took up his own glass, and said,—</p>
               <p>"I seldom drink wine, Nurse,—never, unless a lady joins me! Once I drank with her
                  whose chamber our guest now occupies; and once with another—" Manetho paused. "I
                  never speak her name, Nurse; but we loved each other. I did not treat her well!"
                  he murmured with a sigh, tears in his eyes. "Were she here to-night, at her feet
                  would I sue for pardon,—the renewal of our love. By my soul!" he cried, suddenly,
                  "I had thought to drink a far different toast; but let this glass be drained to
                  the memory of the sweet moments she and I have known together! Drink!"</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6660-00000141"/>
               <p>He tossed off the wine. But poor Nurse, strangely agitated, dropped hers on the
                  floor; the precious liquor was spilled, and the glass shivered. She gazed
                  beseechingly at Manetho. Could he not penetrate that mask to the face behind it?
                  Is flesh so miserably opaque that no spark of the inwardly burning soul can make
                  itself felt or seen without? Manetho saw only the broken glass and its wasted
                  contents!</p>
               <p>"You are as clumsy as you are ugly!" said he. "Go back to your corner. I must
                  converse with my violin."</p>
               <p>She returned heavily to her place, feeling the darker and colder because that wine
                  had been spilled before she could raise it to her lips. One taste, she fancied,
                  might have begun a transformation in her life! But we know not the weight of the
                  chains we lay upon our limbs.</p>
               <p>The Egyptian's buoyant humor had dismissed the whole matter in another moment. He
                  opened his violin-case, lovingly caressing the instrument as he took it out. Then
                  he tucked it fondly under his chin, and resumed his walking. The delicately potent
                  wine warbled through his nerves, and tinted memory with imagination.</p>
               <p>The bow, traversing the strings, drew forth from them a sweet and plaintive note,
                  like the tender remonstrance of a neglected friend. No language says so much in so
                  short space as music, nor will, till we banish those dead bones, consonants, and
                  adopt the pure vowel speech of infants and angels.</p>
               <p>"Ay, long have we been apart, my beloved one, and much have I needed thee!"
                  murmured Manetho. "I yearned for thy soothing and refreshing voice; yea, death
                  walked near me, because thou, my preserver, wast not by to guard me. But, rejoice!
                  all is again well with us,—the hour of our triumph is near!"</p>
               <p>The fine instrument responded, carolling forth an exquisite paean,—an ascending
                  scale, mounting to a breathless ecstasy, and falling in slower melody along
                  gliding waves of fortunate sound. The player drank each perfect note, till his
                  pulses beat in unison with the rhythm. His violin and he were wedded lovers since
                  his youth, nor had discord ever come between them.</p>
               <p>"Two little children weaving flower-chains for each other in the grass. I said,
                  'The one that first comes to me shall be mine!' And the little maiden arose,
                  leaving her brother among the flowers. So one was taken and the other left. But,
                  behold! the brother has come to play with his sister once more!"</p>
               <p>Again the music—a divine philosopher's stone—touched the theme into fine-spun
                  golden harmony. The dusky kitchen, with its one dull lamp glimmering on the table,
                  broadened with marble floors, and sprang<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6660-00000142"
                  /> aloft in airy arches! Twinkling stars hung between the columns, burning with a
                  fragrance like flowers. It was a summer morning, just before sunrise. The clear
                  faces of children peeped from violet-strewn recesses where they had passed the
                  night; and, as their sweet eyes met, they shouted for joy, and ran to embrace one
                  another.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my beloved," softly burst forth the Egyptian, "how blessed are we to-night!"
                  He touched the strings to a measured tune, following with a minuet-step up and
                  down the floor. A fantastic spectacle! for as he passed and repassed the lamp, an
                  elastic shadow crept noiselessly behind him, dodged beneath his feet, and anon
                  outstretched itself like a sudden pit yawning before him. "This night repays the
                  dreary years that lie behind. How have I outlasted them! What had I fallen on the
                  very threshold of requital?—all I had hoped and labored for, a failure!"</p>
               <p>Here paused the tune and the dance, and arose a weird dirge of compassion over
                  what might have been! So moving was it, the player himself was melted. His dark
                  nature showed its fairest side,—sensitive refinement, grace of expression, flowing
                  ease of manner. Quick was he in fancy, emotional, soft and strong, gentle and
                  fiery. In this hour he bloomed, like some night-flowering plant, of perfume sweet
                  but poisonous. This was Manetho's apogee!</p>
               <p>Again his humor changed, and he became playful and frivolous. Had old Nurse in the
                  corner been a little more personable, he might have caught her round the waist,
                  and forced her to tread a wild measure with him. But this unfolding of his
                  faculties in the shower of good fortune had refined his aesthetic susceptibility.
                  The withered, disfigured woman was no partner for him!</p>
               <p>She sat, following, with the intentness of her single eye, his every motion, her
                  head swaying in unconscious sympathy. Although her body sat so stiff and awkward
                  in the chimney-seat, her spirit, inspired with the grace of love, was dancing with
                  Manetho's. But the body kept its place, knowing that erelong he too must come to
                  rest. In the light of a vivid recollection, the long tract between fades and
                  foreshortens, till only the Then and the Now are notable. However, the light will
                  pale, the dusty miles outstretch their length once more, and the pilgrim find
                  himself wearier than ever.</p>
               <p>But meanwhile the clergyman floats hither and thither like a wreath of black smoke
                  blown about by a draught of air. One might have expected to see him all at once
                  vanish up the wide-mouthed chimney. The music seems to emanate less from the
                  instrument than from the player; it interprets and colors every motion and
                  expression. His chanting and his<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6660-00000143"/>
                  playing answer and supplement each other, like strophe and antistrophe.</p>
               <p>"Let me tell thee why I rejoice, that thy sympathy may increase my joy!</p>
               <p>"A beautiful woman, young, a fountain of fresh life, an ivory vase filled with
                  earthly flowers. The eye that gazes on her form is taken captive; yea, her face
                  intoxicates the senses. But she is poisonous, a queen of death, and her feet walk
                  towards destruction!</p>
               <p>"Supple and strong is she as the serpent, quick and graceful as the panther. Food
                  has she for nourishment, for the warming of the blood; exercises for the body, to
                  keep her healthful and fair. Her triumph is in the flesh,—she finds it perfect.
                  The flesh she deems divine,—the earth, a heaven!</p>
               <p>"Books, the world of men,—she knows not: sees in herself Creation's cause and
                  centre; in God, but the myriad reflex of her beauty. Self is her God, whom she
                  worships in thunder and lightning, in sun and stars, in fire and water. Dreaming
                  and waking are alike real to her: she knows not to divide truth from
                  falsehood.</p>
               <p>"Whom should she thank for health, for life and birth? She is born of the fire
                  that burns in her own bosom. To her is nothing lawful nor unlawful. No tie binds
                  her soul to salvation. A fair ship is she, but rudderless, and the wind blows on
                  the rocks. Let God save her if He will—and can!"</p>
               <p>The inspiration of the Arab improvisatore would have seemed tame beside Manetho's
                  nervous exaltation. Save for the tingling satire of the violin-strings, his
                  rhapsody might easily have lapsed to madness. From this point, however, his
                  rapture somewhat abated, and he began to descend towards prose, his music clothing
                  him downwards.</p>
               <p>"As for me, I have bowed down before her, pampering her insolent majesty,
                  preserving her poison to rancor first in her father's heart. Of him, death robbed
                  me; but the son,—the brother is left. Even death spared brother and sister to each
                  other!</p>
               <p>"A handsome man! worthy to stand by her. Never fairer couple sprang from one stem.
                  They love each other,—and shall love!—more than ever brother and sister loved
                  before. But they shall be bound by a tie so close that the mere tie of blood hangs
                  loose beside it! Then shall night come down on them,—a night no rising sun shall
                  ever chase away. In that darkness will I speak—"</p>
               <p>This devilish monologue ended abruptly here. The faithful instrument, whose
                  responsive sympathy had never failed him, jarringly snapped a string! A sting of
                  anguish pricked through Manetho's every nerve. His fictitious buoyancy evaporated
                  like steam,—he<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6660-00000144"/> barely made shift to
                  totter to a chair. Laying the violin with <choice>
                     <sic>tremling</sic>
                     <corr>trembling</corr>
                  </choice> hands on the table, his head dropped on his arms beside it; and there
                  was a long feverish silence.</p>
               <p>At length he raised his haggard face, and, supporting it upon his hands, he gazed
                  at the figure in the chimney-corner; and began, in a tone sullen and devoid of
                  animation as November rain,—</p>
               <p>"Why did you force yourself upon me?—not for Gnulemah's sake, I think. Not for
                  money,—you have had none. Not for love of me either, I fancy,—grisly harpy!</p>
               <p>"Once I suspected you of being a spy. You walked among pitfalls then! But what spy
                  would sit for eighteen years without speech or movement? You have been useful too.
                  No one could have filled your place,—with your one eye and dumb mouth!</p>
               <p>"Did you hate Thor? were you my secret ally against him? But how could you fathom
                  my purposes enough even to help me? And what wrong has he done you terrible enough
                  for such revenge as mine? What human being, except Manetho, could hold an
                  unwavering purpose so many years? Have you never pitied or relented? Sometimes I
                  have almost wavered myself!</p>
               <p>"What name and history have you buried, and never shown me? Why have you spent
                  your dumb life in this seclusion? You are a mystery,—yet a mystery of my own
                  making! I might as wisely dissect my violin to find where lurks the music. A mass
                  of wood and strings,—the music is from me!</p>
               <p>"Have you a thought of preventing the scheme I spoke of to-night?" The Egyptian
                  leaned far across the table, the better to scrutinize the unanswering woman's
                  face. Her eye met his with a steady intelligence that disconcerted him.</p>
               <p>"Are you a woman?" he muttered, drawing back, "and have you no pity on the
                  children whom you nursed in their infancy?—not any pity! as implacable—almost more
                  implacable than I? But think of her beauty and innocence,—for is she not innocent
                  as yet? Would you see her forever ruined,—and stretch forth no saving hand?" Nurse
                  moved her head up and down, as in slow, deliberate assent. Manetho, beholding the
                  reflection in her of his own moral deformity, was filled with abhorrence!</p>
               <p>"More hideous within than without,—you demon! come to haunt me and make me wicked
                  as yourself. It was you snapped the chord of my music,—that better spirit which
                  had till then saved me from your spells! My evil genius! I know you now, though
                  never until this moment."</p>
               <p>This madman was not the first sinner who, happening to catch an outside glimpse of
                  his interior grime,<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6660-00000145"/> has tried to cheat
                  his scared conscience by an outcry of "Devil!—devil!" Is there not a touch of
                  pathos in the vanity of the situation? For the cry is in part sincere; no man can
                  be so wholly evil, while in this world, as quite to divorce the better angel from
                  his soul. But alas! for the poor righteous indignation.</p>

               <p>BALDER HELWYSE, dumfounded before the revelation of the clock, might have stared
                  himself into imbecility, had not he heard his name spoken in sweet human music,
                  and, turning, beheld Gnulemah peeping through the doorway down the hall.</p>
               <p>There was no great distance between them, yet she seemed immeasurable spaces away.
                  Against the bright background of the conservatory her form stood dark, the
                  outlines softened by semi-transparent edges of drapery. But the dull red lamplight
                  lit duskily up the folds of her robe, her golden ornaments, and the black tarns,
                  her eyes. She appeared to waver between the light of heaven and the lurid gloom of
                  heaven's opposite.</p>
               <p>Balder came hastily towards her, waving her back. He was superstitiously anxious
                  that she should return unshadowed to the clear outer sunshine, instead of joining
                  him in this tomb of dead bones and darkness. Darkness might indeed befriend his
                  own imperfections; but should Gnulemah be dimmed to soothe his vanity?</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6660-00000146"/>
               <p>Such emblematic fancies are common to lovers, whose ideal passion tends always to
                  symbolism. But to those who have never loved, it will be enough to say that the
                  young man felt an instinctive desire to spare Gnulemah the ugly spectacle in the
                  clock, and was perhaps not unwilling to escape from it himself!</p>
               <p>She awaited him, in the bright doorway, like an angel come to lead him to a better
                  world. "Do not leave me any more!" she said, putting her hand in his. "You did not
                  do the thing you thought. Let us be together, and dream no more such sadness!"</p>
               <p>"Is her innocence strong enough to protect her against that sinful deluge of
                  confession I poured out upon her?" thought Helwyse, glancing at her face. "Has it
                  fallen from her harmless, like water from a bird's breast? And am I after all no
                  murderer?"</p>
               <p>Doubt nor accusation was in her eyes, but soft feminine faith. Her eyes,—rather
                  than have lost the deep intelligence of their dark light, Balder would have
                  consented to blotting from heaven its host of stars! Through them shone on
                  him,—not justice, but the divine injustice of woman's love! That wondrous bond,
                  more subtile than light, and more enduring than adamant, had leagued her to him.
                  Consecrated by the blessing of her trust, he must not dare distrust himself. If
                  the past were blindly wrong, she was the God-given clew to guide him right.</p>
               <p>An unspeakable tenderness melted them both,—him for what he received, her for what
                  she gave. The rich bud of their love bloomed at once in full, fragrant
                  stateliness. Their hearts, left unprotected by their out-opened arms, demanded
                  shelter, and found it in nestling on each other. Heaven touched earth in the
                  tremulous, fiery calm of their meeting lips,—magnets whose currents flowed from
                  the mysterious poles of humanity.</p>
               <p>At such moments—the happiest life counts but few—angels draw near, but veil their
                  happy eyes. Spirits of evil grind their teeth and frown; and, for one awful
                  instant, perceive their own deformity!</p>
               <p>Before yet that dear embrace had lasted an eternity, the man felt the woman shiver
                  in his arms. The celestial heights and spaces dwindled, the angelic music fainted.
                  Heaven rolled back and left them alone on earth. Manetho stood on the threshold
                  between the sphinxes, wearing such a smile as God has never doomed us to see on a
                  child's face!</p>
               <p>To few men comes the opportunity of facing in this life those whom they believed
                  they had put out of it. One might expect the palpable assurance of the victim's
                  survival would electrify the fancied murderer. But to Balder's mind, his personal
                  responsibility could not be thus lightened; and any emotion of selfish relief was
                  therefore denied him. On the<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6660-00000147"/> other
                  hand, such inferences as he had been able to draw from things seen and heard were
                  not to Manetho's advantage. While he could not but rejoice to have been spared
                  actually hurrying a soul from the life of free will to an unchangeable eternity,
                  yet his dominant instinct was to man himself for the hostile issues still to
                  arise. He looked at the being through whom his own life had received so dark a
                  stain with stern, keen eyes.</p>
               <p>Gnulemah remained within the circle of her lover's arm. She seemed but little
                  interested in Manetho's appearance, save in so far as he invaded the sanctity of
                  her new immortal privilege. She had never known anxiety on his account; he had
                  never appealed to her feeling for himself. If she loved him, it was with an
                  affection unconscious because untried. She had shivered in Balder's embrace at the
                  moment of the Egyptian's presence, but before having set eyes on him. Had the
                  nearness of his discordant spirit—his familiar face unseen—made her conscious of
                  an evil emanation from him, else unperceived?</p>
               <p>Manetho, to do him justice, assumed anything but a hostile attitude. His pleasure
                  at seeing the pair so well affected towards each other was plainly manifested. He
                  clasped his hands together, then extended them with a gesture of benediction and
                  greeting, and came forward. His swarthy face, narrowing from brow to chin, if it
                  could not be frank and hearty, at least expressed a friendliness which it had been
                  ungracious to mistrust.</p>
               <p>"Yes, son of Thor, I live! God has been merciful to both of us. Let one who knew
                  your father take your hand. Believe that whatever I have felt for him, I now feel
                  for you,—and more!"</p>
               <p>The speaker had cast aside the fashionable clothes which he was in the habit of
                  wearing during his journeys abroad, probably with a view to guard against being
                  conspicuous, and was clad in antique priestly costume. A curiously figured and
                  embroidered robe fell to his feet, and was confined at the waist by a long girdle,
                  which also passed round his shoulders, after the manner of a Jewish ephod. It
                  invested him with a dignity of presence such as ordinary garments would not have
                  suggested. This, combined with the unexpectedly pacific tone of his address (its
                  somewhat fantastic formality suiting well with that of his appearance), was not
                  without effect on Balder. He gave his hand with some cordiality.</p>
               <p>"Yours, also?" continued the other, addressing Gnulemah with an involuntary
                  deference that surprised her lover. She complied, as a princess to her subject.
                  This incident seemed to indicate their position relatively to each other. Had the
                  wily Egyptian played the slave so well, as finally in good earnest to have become
                  one?</p>
               <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6660-00000148"/>
               <p>The three stood for a moment joined in a circle, through which what incongruous
                  passions were circulating! But Gnulemah soon withdrew the hand held by Manetho,
                  and sent it to seek the one clasped by Balder. The priest turned cold, and stepped
                  back; and, after an appearance of mental struggle, said huskily,—</p>
               <p>"Hiero is forgotten; you are all for the stranger!"</p>
               <p>"You never told me who lived beyond the wall," returned Gnulemah, with simple
                  dignity; and added, "You are no less to me than before, but Balder is—my love!"
                  The last words came shyly from her lips, and she swayed gently, like a noble tree,
                  towards him she named.</p>
               <p>Manetho's lips worked against each other, and his body twitched. He was learning
                  the difference between theory and practice,—dream and fact. His subtle schemes had
                  been dramas enacted by variations of himself. No allowance had been made for the
                  working of spirit on spirit; even his special part had been designed too narrowly,
                  with but a single governing emotion, whereas he already found himself assailed by
                  an anarchic host of them.</p>
               <p>"Gnulemah!" he cried at length, "my study,—my thought,—my purpose,—body of my
                  hopes and prayers!" He knelt and bowed himself at her feet, in the Oriental
                  posture of worship, and went on with rising passion:—"My secrets have bloomed in
                  thy beauty,—been music in thy voice,—darkened in thine eyes! O my
                  flower—fascinating, terrible!—the time is ripe for the gathering, for the smelling
                  of the perfume, for the kissing of the petals! I must yield thee up, O my idol!
                  but in thy hand are my life and my reason,—yea, Gnulemah, thou art all I am!"</p>
               <p>The tears, gestures, voice, with which Manetho thus delivered himself, shocked the
                  Northern taste of Helwyse. Through the semi-scriptural, symbolic language, he
                  fancied he could discern a basis of materialism so revolting that the man of the
                  world—the lover now!—listened with shame and anger. Here was a professed
                  worshipper of Gnulemah, who ascribed to her no nobler worth than to be the
                  incarnation of his own desires and passions! It was abject self-idolatry, thought
                  Balder, masquerading as a lofty form of idealization.</p>
               <p>The priest's mind was in a more complex condition than Balder imagined. His
                  absorption in Gnulemah, if only as she was the instrument of his dominant purpose,
                  must have been complete; the success (as he deemed it) of his life was staked on
                  her. But, in addition to this, the unhappy man had, unwittingly, and with the
                  vehemence of his ill-ordered nature, grown to love the poison-draught brewed for
                  his enemy! When the enemy's lips touched the cup, did Manetho first<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000149"/> become aware that it brimmed with the brewer's own
                  life-blood!</p>
               <p>Yet it might have been foreseen. He loved her, not because she was identified with
                  his aims, nor even because she was beautiful, but (and not inconsistently with his
                  theoretical belief in her devilishness) because she was pure and true. Under the
                  persuasion that he was influencing her nature in a manner only possible, if at
                  all, to a moral and physical despot, he had himself been ruled by her stronger and
                  loftier spirit. The transcendent cunning on which he had prided himself, as
                  regarded his plan of educating Gnulemah, had amounted to little more than imbecile
                  inaction.</p>
               <p>As Manetho prostrated himself, and even touched the hem of Gnulemah's robe to his
                  forehead, Balder looked to see her recoil; but she maintained a composure which
                  argued her not unused to such homage. So much evil (albeit unintentionally) had
                  the Egyptian done her, that she could suffer, while she slighted, his worship.
                  Yet, in the height of her proud superiority to him, she turned with sweet
                  submission to her lover, and, obedient to his whisper, gathered up her purple
                  mantle and passed through the green conservatory to her own door, through which,
                  with a backward parting glance at her master, she superbly vanished. Balder had
                  disliked the scene throughout, yet his love was greater than before. An awe of the
                  woman whose innate force could command a nature like this priest's seemed to give
                  his passion for her a more vigorous fibre.</p>
               <p>The two men were now left alone to come to what understanding they might. Manetho
                  rose to his feet, obliquely eying Helwyse, and spoke with the manner and tone of
                  true humility,—</p>
               <p>"You have seen me in my weakness. I am but a broken man, Balder Helwyse."</p>
               <p>"We had better speak the plain truth to each other," said Balder, after a pause.
                  "You can have no cause to be friendly to me. I cannot extenuate what I did. I
                  think I meant to kill you."</p>
               <p>"You were not to blame!" exclaimed the other, vehemently, holding up his hands.
                  "You had to deal with a madman!"</p>
               <p>"It is a strange train of chances has brought us together again; it ought to be
                  for some good end. I came here unawares, and, but for this ring, should not have
                  known that we had met before."</p>
               <p>"I lie under your suspicion on more accounts than one," observed Manetho, glancing
                  in the other's face. "I have assumed your uncle's name, and the disposal of his
                  property; and I have concealed his death; but you shall be satisfied on all
                  points. The child, too, Gnulemah!—I have kept her from sight and knowledge of the
                  world, but not without reason and purpose<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6660-00000150"
                  /> pose, as you shall hear. Ah! I am but a poor broken man, liable, as you have
                  seen, to fits of madness and extravagance. You shall hear everything. And
                  listen,—as a witness that I shall speak truth, I will say my say before the face
                  of Hiero Glyphic yonder, and upon the steps of his altar! See, I desire neither to
                  palliate nor falsify. Shall we go in?"</p>
               <p>With some repugnance Helwyse followed the priestly figure through the low-browed
                  door. He had seen too much of men to allow any instinctive aversion to influence
                  him, in the absence of logical evidence. And this man's words sounded fair; his
                  frank admission of occasional insanity accounted for many anomalies. Nevertheless,
                  and apart from any question of personal danger, Balder felt ill at ease, like
                  animals before a thunder-storm. As he sat down beside his companion on the steps
                  of the black altar, and glanced up at the yellow visage that presided over it, he
                  tried to quiet his mind in vain; even the thought of Gnulemah yielded a vague
                  anxiety!</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">BETROTHAL.</head>
               <p>THE ring, which Balder had taken off with the intention of returning it to its
                  owner, still remained between his thumb and finger; and as he sat under the gloom
                  of the altar, its excellent brilliancy caught his eye. He had never examined it
                  minutely. It was pure as virtue, and possessed similar power to charm the dusky
                  air into seven-hued beauty. A fountain of lustre continually welled up from its
                  interior, like an exhaustless spring of wisdom. From amidst the strife of the
                  little serpents it shone serenely forth, with divine assurance of good,—eternal
                  before the battle began, and immortal after it should cease. The light refreshed
                  the somewhat jaded Helwyse, and during the ensuing interview he ever and anon
                  renewed the draught.</p>
               <p>But the Egyptian seemed to address a silent invocation to the mummy. The
                  anti-spiritual kind of immortality belonging to mummies may have been congenial to
                  Manetho's soul. Awful is that loneliness which even the prospect of death has
                  deserted, and<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6660-00000151"/> which must prolong itself
                  throughout a lifeless and hopeless Forever! If Manetho could imagine any bond of
                  relationship between this perennial death's-head and himself, no marvel that he
                  cherished it jealously.</p>
               <p>"You shall hear first about myself," said the priest; "yet, truly, I know not how
                  to begin! No mind can know another, nor even its own essential secrets. My time
                  has been full of visions and unrealities. I am the victim of a thing which, for
                  lack of a better name, I call myself!"</p>
               <p>"Not a rare sickness," remarked Balder.</p>
               <p>"A ghost no spell can lay! It grasps the rudder, and steers towards gulfs the will
                  abhors. A crew of unholy, mutinous impulses fling abroad words and thoughts
                  unrecognizable. Not Manetho talked in the blackness of that night; but a devil, to
                  whom I listened shuddering, unable to control him!"</p>
               <p>"The Reverend Manetho Glyphic, my cousin by adoption,—and sometimes a devil!"
                  muttered Balder, musingly. "I had forgotten him."</p>
               <p>People are more prone to err in fancying themselves righteous, than the reverse;
                  nevertheless, the course and limits of self-deception are indefinite. It is within
                  possibility for a man to believe himself wicked, while his actual conduct is
                  ridiculously blameless, even praiseworthy! Although intending to mislead Balder,
                  Manetho's utterances were true to a degree unsuspected by himself. He was more
                  true than had he tried to be so, because truth lay too profound for his
                  recognition!</p>
               <p>"A shallower man," he resumed, "would bear a grudge against the hand that clutched
                  his throat; but I own no relationship to the madman you chastised. And there are
                  deep reasons why I must set your father's son above all other men in my
                  regard."</p>
               <p>"My father seldom spoke of you, and never as of an especial friend," interposed
                  the ingenuous Balder.</p>
               <p>"He knew not my feeling towards him, nor would he have comprehended it. It is a
                  thing I myself can scarce understand. To the outward eye there is juster cause for
                  hatred than for love.</p>
               <p>"I will speak openly to you what has hitherto lain between my heart and God.
                  Before Thor saw your mother, I had loved her. My life's hope was to marry her.
                  Thor came,—and my hope lingered and died. For it, was no resurrection." Here
                  Manetho broke all at once into sobs, covering his face with his hands; and when he
                  continued, his voice was softened with tears.</p>
               <p>"Thor called her to him, and she gladly went. He stormed and carried with ease the
                  fortress which, at best, I could hope only slowly to undermine. She loved him as
                  women love a conqueror; she might have yielded me, at most, the grace of a
                     condescending<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6660-00000152"/> queen. I kept silence:
                  to whom could I speak? I had felt great ambitions,—to become honored and
                  famous,—to preach the gospel as it had not yet been preached,—all ambitions that a
                  lover may feel. But the tree died for lack of nourishment. See what is left!"</p>
               <p>He opened out his arms with a gesture wanting neither in pathos nor dignity.
                  Balder could not but sympathize with what he felt to be a genuine emotion.</p>
               <p>"Amidst the ruins of my Memphis, I kept silence. I hated—myself! for my
                  powerlessness to keep her. In my hours of madness I hated her too, and him; but
                  that was madness indeed! Deeper down was a sanity that loved him. Since he had
                  made my love his, I must love him. So only might I still love her. The only beauty
                  left my ruins was that!</p>
               <p>"She died; and with her would have died all sanity,—all love, but that her
                  children kept me back from worse ruin than was mine already. They were a link to
                  bind me to the good. Now Thor is dead, but still his son—her son—survives. Hence
                  is it that you are more to me than other men."</p>
               <p>"Did Doctor Glyphic know nothing of this?"</p>
               <p>"I never told him of either my hope or my despair. My beloved master! he lived and
                  died without suspicion that I had striven to be a brother as well as son to
                  him."</p>
               <p>"When did he die?"</p>
               <p>"Eighteen years ago," said Manetho, solemnly. "You are the first to whom his death
                  has been revealed. Beloved master! have I not obeyed thy will?" And he looked up
                  to his master's parchment visage.</p>
               <p>"I discovered his death for myself, you know," observed Helwyse. "But it could not
                  have been more than eighteen years since my father, then on the point of departure
                  for Europe, saw Hiero Glyphic alive!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Did he ever tell you what passed in that interview?" demanded Manetho,
                  eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Little more than a farewell, I think. There was some talk about the estate. At my
                  uncle's death, the house was to come to you, the property to my father or his
                  heirs. But neither expected at that time that it was to be their last
                  meeting."</p>
               <p>"Was no one mentioned beside Thor's children and myself?" asked the priest,
                  looking askant at Balder as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"No; my uncle neither had nor expected children, as far as I know!"</p>
               <p>"Thor did not see her,—Gnulemah?"</p>
               <p>"Gnulemah?—how should he have seen her?" exclaimed Balder, in surprise.</p>
               <p>"Then her mystery remains!" said Manetho, looking up.</p>
               <p>He had perhaps doubted whether any suspicion of<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000153"/> who Gnulemah really was had found its way to the
                  young man's mind. The latter's reception of his question reassured him. There
                  could be no risk in catering to his aroused curiosity. The account Mane-tho now
                  gave was true, though falsehood lurked in the pauses.</p>
               <p>"That day Thor came, I left the house early in the morning. It was night when I
                  returned; and Thor was gone. The house was dark, and at first there was no sound.
                  But presently I heard the voice of a child, murmuring and babbling baby words. I
                  passed through the outer hall and the conservatory, and came to where we now are.
                  The lamp was burning, as it has burned ever since.</p>
               <p>"I saw him lying on the altar steps,—lying so!" Marrying act to word, the Egyptian
                  slid down and lay prostrate at the altar's foot. "He was dead and cold!" he added;
                  and gave way to a shuddering outburst of grief.</p>
               <p>Balder's nerves were a little staggered at this tale, with its heightening of
                  dramatic action and morbid circumstance; and he was silent until the actor (if
                  such he were) was in some degree repossessed of himself. Then he asked,—</p>
               <p>"What of the child?"</p>
               <p>"I have named her Gnulemah. She played about the dead body, bright and careless as
                  the flame of the lamp. Whence she came she could not tell, nor had I seen her
                  before that day. It seemed that, at the moment my master's life burned out, hers
                  flamed up; and since that day it has lighted and warmed my solitude."</p>
               <p>"And Doctor Glyphic—"</p>
               <p>"I embalmed him!" cried Manetho, clasping his hands in grotesque enthusiasm. "It
                  was my privilege and my consolation to render his body immortal. In my grief I
                  rejoiced at the opportunity of manifesting my devotion. Not the proudest of the
                  Pharaohs was more sumptuously preserved than he! In that labor of love there was
                  no cunning secret of the art that I did not employ. Night and day I worked alone;
                  and while he lay in the long nitre bath, I watched or slept beside him. Then I
                  enwound him thousand-fold in finest linen smeared with fragrant gum, and hid his
                  beloved form in the coffin he had chosen long before."</p>
               <p>"Did my uncle choose this form of burial?"</p>
               <p>"He lived in hopes of it! It was his wish that his body might be disposed as
                  became his name, and the passion that had ruled his life. Me only did he deem
                  worthy of the task, and equal to it. Had I died before him, his fairest hope would
                  have been blighted, his life a failure!"</p>
               <p>"A dead failure, truly!" muttered Balder, impelled<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000154"/> by the very grewsomeness of the subject to jest
                  about it. "Was his loftiest aspiration to mummy and be mummied?—But yours was a
                  dangerous office to fulfil, Cousin Manetho. Had the death got abroad, you might
                  have been suspected of foul play!"</p>
               <p>"The cause was worth the risk," replied the other, sententiously.</p>
               <p>Helwyse shot a keen look at his companion, but could discern in him none of the
                  common symptoms of guilt. The priest, however, was a mine of sunless riddles, one
                  lode connecting with another; it was idle attempting to explore them all at once.
                  So the young man recurred to that vein which was of most immediate interest to
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"Have you no knowledge concerning Gnulemah's origin?" he inquired.</p>
               <p>Manetho laid his long brown hand on Balder's arm.</p>
               <p>"If she be not Gnulemah, daughter of fire, it must rest with you to give her
                  another name," said he.</p>
               <p>"I care not who was her father or her mother," rejoined the lover, after a short
                  silence; "Gnulemah is herself!"</p>
               <p>The lithe fingers on his arm clutched it hard for a moment, and Manetho averted
                  his face. When he turned again, his features seemed to express exultation, mingled
                  with a sinister flavor of some darker emotion.</p>
               <p>"Son of Thor, you have your father's frankness. Do you love her?"</p>
               <p>"You saw that I loved her," returned Balder, his black eyes kindling somewhat
                  intolerantly.</p>
               <p>"If I can hasten by one hour the consummation of that love, my life will have been
                  worth the living!"</p>
               <p>"That's kindly spoken!" exclaimed Helwyse, heartily; and, opening his strong white
                  hand, he took the narrow brown one into its grasp. He had not been prepared for so
                  friendly a profession.</p>
               <p>"When I have seen your soul tied to hers in a knot that even death may not
                  loosen,—and if it be permitted me to tie the knot, I shall have drained the cup of
                  earthly happiness!" He spoke with a deliberate intensity not altogether pleasant
                  to the ear. He would not relinquish Balder's hand, as he continued in his
                  high-strung vein,—</p>
               <p>"I know at last for whom my flower has bloomed. Through the world, across seas, by
                  strange accidents has Providence brought you safe to this spot; and has made you
                  what you are, and her incomparable among women.—You love her with heart and soul,
                  Balder Helwyse?"</p>
               <p>"So that the world seems frail, and I—except for my love—insignificant!"</p>
               <p>In the sudden emphasis of his question, Manetho<pb n="308-309"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000155"/> had risen to his feet; and Balder likewise had
                  started up, before giving his reply. As he spoke the words strongly forth, his
                  swarthy companion seemed to catch them in the air, and breathe them in. Slowly an
                  expression of joy, that could hardly be called a smile, welled forth from his long
                  eyes, and forced its way, with dark persistency of glee, through all his face.</p>
               <p>"By you only in the world would I have her loved!" he said; and repeated it more
                  than once.</p>
               <p>He remained a full minute leaning with one arm on the altar, his eyes abstracted.
                  Then he said abruptly,—</p>
               <p>"Why not be married soon?"</p>
               <p>The lover looked up questioningly, a deep throb in his heart.</p>
               <p>"Soon—soon!" reiterated Manetho. "Love is a thing of moments more than of years. I
                  know it! Do you stand idle while Gnulemah awaits you? We may die to-morrow!"</p>
               <p>"I have no right to hurry her," said Helwyse in a low voice. "She knows nothing of
                  the world. I would marry her to-morrow—"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow! why not to-day? Why wait? that she may learn the falsehoods of
                  society,—to flirt, dress, gossip, crave flattery? Why do you hesitate? Speak out,
                  son of Thor!"</p>
               <p>"I have spoken. Do you doubt me? Were it possible, she should be my wife this
                  hour!"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" murmured Manetho, the incisiveness of his manner melting away as suddenly as
                  it came; "now have you proved your love. You shall be made one,—one!—to-day.
                  Four-and-twenty years ago this day, I married your parents on this very spot. The
                  anniversary shall become a double one!"</p>
               <p>The black eye-sockets of the mummy stared Balder in the face. But at a touch from
                  Manetho, he turned, and saw Gnulemah, bright with beautiful enchantment, in the
                  doorway.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-day!" he said impetuously.</p>
               <p>"You shall wed her with that ring!" whispered the victorious tempter in his ear.
                  "Go to her; tell her what marriage is! I will call you soon."</p>
               <p>The lover went, and the woman, coming forward, sweetly met him half-way. But
                  glancing back again before passing out, Balder saw that the priest had vanished;
                  and the lamp, flickering above the mummy's dry features, wrought them into a
                  shadowy semblance of emotion.</p>

               <head>XXIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A CHAMBER OF THE HEART.</head>
               <p>MANETHO neither sank through the granite floor, nor ascended in the smoke of the
                  lamp. He unlocked a door (to the panels of which the clock was affixed, and which
                  it concealed) and let himself into his private study, a room scarce seven feet
                  wide, though corresponding in length and height with the dimensions of the outer
                  temple. Books and papers were kept here, and such other things of a private or
                  valuable nature as Manetho wished should be inaccessible to outsiders. Against the
                  wall opposite the door stood a heavy mahogany table; beside it, a deep-bottomed
                  chair, in which the priest now sat down.</p>
               <p>The room was destitute of windows, properly so called. The walls were full twenty
                  feet high; and at a distance of some sixteen feet from the floor, a series of low
                  horizontal apertures pierced the masonry, allowing the light of heaven to
                  penetrate in an embarrassed manner, and hesitatingly to reveal the interior.
                  Viewed from without, these narrow slits would be mistaken for mere architectural
                  indentations. To the inhabitant they were of more importance, contracted though
                  they were; and albeit one could not look out of them, they served as ventilators,
                  and to distinguish between fine and cloudy weather.</p>
               <p>In his earlier and more active days, Manetho had lived and worked throughout the
                  whole extent of this study, and it had been kept clean and orderly to its remotest
                  corner. But as years passed, and the range of his sympathies and activities
                  narrowed, the ends of the room had gradually fallen into dusty neglect, till at
                  length only the small space about the chair and table was left clear and
                  available. The rest was impeded by books, instruments of science, and endless
                  chaotic rubbish; while spiders had handed down their ever-broadening estates from
                  father to child, through innumerable Araneidæan generations. A gray uniformity had
                  thus come to overspread everything; and with the exceptions of a cracked celestial
                  globe, and the end of a worm-eaten old ladder, there was nothing to catch the
                  attention.</p>
               <p>Here might the Egyptian indulge himself in whatever extravagances of word or act
                  he chose, secure from sight or hearing; and here had he spent many an hour in such
                  solitary exercises as no sane mind can conceive. To him the room was thick with
                  associations. Here had he pursued his studies, or helped the Doctor in his erratic
                  experiments and research; here,<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6660-00000157"/> with
                  Helen in his thoughts, he had shaped out a career,—not all of Christian humility
                  and charity, perhaps, but at least unstained by positive sin, and not unmindful of
                  domestic happiness. Here, again, had Salome visited him, bringing discord and
                  delight in equal parts; for at times, with the strong heat of youth, he had vowed
                  to love only her and to forsake ambition; and anon the bloodless counsels of
                  worldly power and welfare banished her with a curse for having crossed his path.
                  Head and heart were always at war in Manetho. The talismanic diamond flashed or
                  waned, and fiercely wriggled the little fighting serpents.</p>
               <p>At length Thor Helwyse's gauntlet was thrown into the ring; and peace—if still
                  present to outward seeming—abode not in the feverish soul of the Egyptian. But it
                  was his nature to dissemble. In this room he had often outwatched the night,
                  chewing the cud of his wrongs, invoking vengeance upon the thwarter of his hopes,
                  and swearing through his teeth to even the balance between them. The black serpent
                  held the golden one helpless in his coils. The obtuse Doctor, blundering in at
                  morning, would find his adopted son with pallid cheeks and glittering eyes, but
                  ever ready with a smile and pleasant greeting, obedience and help. Hiero Glyphic,
                  however wayward and cross-grained, never had cause to censure this creature of
                  his,—to remind him that he might have been food for crocodiles.</p>
               <p>Manetho's dissimulation was almost without flaw. Even Helen, whose fancy had
                  played with him at first, but who in time had indolently yielded to the
                  fascination exerted over her, and even gone so far as to permit his adulation, and
                  accept in the ring the mystic pledge thereof (during all the countless ages of its
                  experience it had never touched woman's hand before),—even she, when her lazy
                  heart and overbearing spirit were at length aroused and quelled by the voice
                  rather of a master than suitor, was deceived by forsaken Manetho's unruffled face,
                  gentle voice, and downcast eyes. She told herself that his love had never dared be
                  warmer than a kind of worship, like that of a pagan for his idol, apart from human
                  passion; such, at all events, had been her understanding of his attentions. As to
                  the ring, it had been tendered as an offering at the shrine of abstract womanhood;
                  to return it too soon would imply a supposition of more personal sentiment.
                  Neither must Thor see it, however; his rough sense would fail to appreciate her
                  fine-drawn distinction. So she concealed it in her bosom, and Manetho's serpents
                  were ever between Thor and his wife's heart. She was false both to husband and
                  lover.</p>
               <p>Great Thor, meanwhile, pitied the slender Egyptian, and in a kindly way despised
                  him, with his supple manners, quiet words, and religious studies. To the young
                  priest's timid yet earnest request for permission<pb n="314-315"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000158"/> to pronounce the marriage-service of him and his
                  bride, Thor assented with gruff heartiness.</p>
               <p>"Marry us? Of course! marry us as fast as you can, if it gives you any pleasure,
                  my friend of the crocodile. A good beginning for your ministerial career,—marrying
                  a couple who love each other as much as Nell and I do. Eh, Nellie?"</p>
               <p>The ceremony over, Manetho had retired to his study, and there passed the
                  night,—their marriage-night! What words and tones, what twistings of face and
                  body, did those passionless walls see and hear? How the smooth, studious,
                  submissive priest yearned for power to work his will for one day! And as the cool,
                  still morning sheared the lustre from his lamp-flame, how desolate he felt, with
                  his hatred and despair and blaspheming rage! Evil passions are but poor company,
                  in the early morning.</p>
               <p>But was not Salome left him? The only sincerely tender words he had ever spoken to
                  woman had been said to her: his humblest and happiest thoughts had been born of
                  their early acquaintance,—before he had raised his eyes to the proud and languid
                  mistress. Yet on her only did the evil passions of Manetho wreak themselves in
                  harm and wrong; her only, on a later day, did he dastardly strike down. Poor
                  Salome had given him her heart. These walls had seen their meetings.</p>
               <p>Years afterwards, Manetho had here embalmed his foster-father: through long hours
                  had he labored at his hateful task, with curious zest and conscientiousness. As
                  regarded the strange place of sepulture, the Egyptian had perhaps imagined a
                  symbolic fitness in enclosing his human immortal in the empty shell of time. Over
                  this matter of Hiero Glyphic's death and burial, however, must ever brood a cloud
                  of mystery. Undoubtedly Manetho loved the man,—but death was not always the worst
                  of ills in Manetho's philosophy.</p>
               <p>The clock had been affixed to the study door both as an additional concealment,
                  and possibly as a congenial sentry over the interior associations. Since then the
                  place had become the clergyman's almost daily resort. Pacing the contracted floor,
                  sitting moodily in the chair,—many a brooding hour had gone over his barrenly busy
                  head, and written its darkening record in his book of life. Here had been schemed
                  that plan of revenge, whose insanity the insane schemer could not perceive. Nor
                  could he understand that mightier powers than he could master worked against him,
                  and even used his efforts to bring forth contrary results.</p>
               <p>But not all hours had passed so. Spaces there had been wherein evil counsels had
                  retired to a cloudy background, athwart which had brightened a rainbow,
                  intangible, whose source was hidden, but whose colors were true before his eyes.
                  The grace and aerial beauty<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6660-00000159"/> of sunshine
                  lightened through the rain,—the pleasing loveliness of essential life was
                  projected on the gloom of evil imaginations. For Manetho's actual deeds were apt
                  to be prompted by far gentler influences than governed his theories. The man was
                  better than his mind: and goodness, perhaps, bears an absolute blessing; insomuch
                  that the sinner, doing ignorant good, yet feels the benefit thereof; just as the
                  rain, however dismal, cannot prevent the sun from making rainbows out of it.</p>
               <p>On this particular morning Manetho sank into his deep-seated chair, and was quite
                  still. A great part of what had hitherto made his daily life ended here. The
                  activity of existence was over for him. Thought, feeling, hope, could live
                  hereafter only as phantoms of memory. But to look back on evil done is not so
                  pleasant as to plan it; the dead body of a foe moves us in another way than his
                  living hostile person.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, Manetho should have hurled to its mark the long-poised spear, he
                  would have little to look forward to. That one moment of triumph must repay, both
                  for what had been and was to come. To-day of all his days, then, must each sense
                  and faculty be in exquisite condition. Unseasonably enough, however, he found
                  himself in a perversely dull and callous state. Could Providence so cajole him as
                  to mar the only joyful hour of his life! Then better off than he were savages, who
                  could destroy their recusant idols. But nothing short of spiritual suicide would
                  have destroyed the idol of Manetho!</p>
               <p>He was wearing to-day the same priestly robe which he had put on when, for the
                  first and last time, he performed a ministerial duty. In this robe had he married
                  Helen to Thor. Itself a precious relic of antiquity, it had once dignified the
                  shoulders of a contemporary of Manetho's remotest ancestors. Old Hiero Glyphic had
                  counted it amongst his chiefest treasures; and on his sister's wedding-day had
                  produced it from its repository, insisting that the minister should wear it
                  instead of the orthodox sacerdotal costume. Since then it had lain untouched till
                  to-day.</p>
               <p>Manetho brooded over the dim magnificence of its folds, sitting amidst the
                  cobwebbed rubbish, a narrow glint of sunshine creeping slope-downwards from the
                  crevice above his head. He smoothed the fabric abstractedly with his hand,
                  recalling the thoughts and scenes of four-and-twenty years ago.</p>
               <p>"I joined them in the holy bonds of matrimony,—read over them that service, those
                  sacred words heavy with solemn benediction. Rich, smooth, softly modulated was my
                  voice, missing not one just emphasis or melodious intonation. Ah! had they seen my
                  soul. But my eyes were half closed like the crocodile's, yet never losing sight of
                  the two I was uniting in sight of<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6660-00000160"/> God
                  and man. The Devil too was there. He turned the blessings my lips uttered into
                  blighting curses, that fell on the happy couple like pestilential rain!</p>
               <p>"Laughable! Covered head to foot with curses, and felt them not! All was smiles,
                  blushes, happiness, forward-looking to a long, joyful future. They knelt before
                  me; I uplifted my hands and invoked the last blessing,—the final curse! My heart
                  burned, and the smoke of its fire enveloped bride and groom, fouling his yellow
                  beard, and smirching her silvery veil; shutting out heaven from their prayers, and
                  blackening their path before them. They neither felt nor knew. They kissed,—I saw
                  their lips meet,—as Balder and Gnulemah to-day. Then I covered my face and seemed
                  to be in prayer!</p>
               <p>"Gnulemah,—I hate her!—yes, but hatred sometimes touches the heart like love. I
                  love her!—to marry her? Woe to him who becomes her husband! As a daughter?—no
                  daughter is she of mine!—I hate her, then.</p>
               <p>"Why am I childless?—how would I have loved a child! I would have left all else to
                  love my child! I would have been the one father in the world! My life should have
                  been full of love as it has been of hate. Why did not God send me a wife and a
                  daughter?"</p>
               <p>Men's ears have grown deaf to any save the most commonplace oracles. But there is
                  ever a warning voice for who will listen. One may object that its language is
                  unknown, or its whisper inaudible; but to the question, "Whence your ignorance and
                  deafness?" what shall be the answer?</p>
               <p>In Manetho's case it appears to have been the venerable robe that took on itself
                  the task of remonstrance.</p>
               <p>"You are unreasonable, friend," it interposed with a gentle rustle. "Gnulemah, if
                  not your daughter, might, however, have stood you in place of one; and she would
                  have done you just as much good, in the way of softening and elevating your
                  nature, as though she had been the issue of your own loins. You have turned the
                  milk and honey of your life into gall and wormwood; and I wish I could feel sure
                  that only you would get the benefit of it!"</p>
               <p>The reproof had as well been spared; it is doubtful whether the culprit heard so
                  much as a word of it. His reverie rambled on.</p>
               <p>"Keen,—that Balder! he half suspects me. Had I not so hurried him to a conclusion,
                  he would have questioned me too closely. He shall know all presently, even as I
                  promised him!—shall hear a sounder guess at Gnulemah's genealogy than was made
                  to-day.</p>
               <p>"Do I love her?—only as the means to my end! The end once gained, I shall hate her
                  as I do him. But not yet,—and therefore must I love him as well as her. They shall
                  be, to-day, my beloved children!<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6660-00000161"/>
                  To-morrow,—how shall I endure till to-morrow,—all the night through? O
                  Gnulemah!—</p>
               <p>"They love each other well,—seem made to make each other happy; yet have they come
                  together from the ends of the earth to be each other's curse! Only if I keep
                  silence might it be otherwise, for love might tame the devil that I have bred in
                  Gnulemah. Even now she seems more angel than devil!—Am I mad?"</p>
               <p>He straightened himself in his chair, and glanced up towards the crevice whence
                  slanted the dusty sunshine. The old robe took the opportunity to deliver its final
                  warning.</p>
               <p>"Not yet mad beyond remedy, Manetho; but you look up too seldom at the sunshine,
                  and brood too often over your own dusty depths. You have had no consciously
                  unselfish thought during the last quarter of a century. You eat, drink, and
                  breathe only Manetho! This room is yours, because it is fullest of rubbish, and
                  least looks out upon the glorious universe. Break down your walls! take broom in
                  hand without delay! Proclaim at once the crime you meditate. Go! there is still
                  sunshine in this dust-hole of yours, and more of heaven in every man than he
                  himself dreams of. The sun is passing to the other side. Go while it shines!"</p>
               <p>But Manetho's dull ears heard not; and the aged garment of truth spoke no
                  more.</p>

               <p>IT seems a pity that, with all imagination at our service, we should have to
                  confine our excursions within so narrow a domain as this of Hiero Glyphic's. One
                  tires of the best society, uncondimented with an occasional foreign relish, even
                  of doubtful digestibility. Barring this, it only remains to relieve somewhat the
                  monotony of our food, by variety in the modes of dishing it up.</p>
               <p>Balder had been no whit disconcerted at the priest's abrupt evanishment. The
                  divine sphere of Gnulemah had touched him with its sweet magnetism, and he was
                  sensible of little beyond it. Their hands greeted like life-long friends. Drawing
                  hers within his arm, he still kept hold of it, and her rounded shoulder softly
                  pressed his, as they loitered out between the impenetrable sphinxes. The
                  conservatory, however beautiful in itself and by association, was too small to
                  hold their hearts at this moment. They passed on, and through the columns of the
                  Moorish portico, into the fervent noon sunshine.</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6660-00000162"/>
               <p>Grasshoppers chirped; fine buzzing flies darted in swift circles and lit again;
                  birds giggled and gossiped, bobbing and swinging among swaying boughs. Battalions
                  of vast green trees stood grand in shadow-lakes of cooler green, their myriad
                  leaves twinkling light and dark. Tender gleams of river topped the enamelled
                  bank,—the further shore a slumbering El Dorado. The trees in the distant orchard
                  wore bridal veils, and even Gnulemah's breath was not much sweeter than
                  theirs!</p>
               <p>Emerging arm in arm on the enchanted lawn, the lovers turned southwards up the
                  winding avenue. The fragrance, the light and warmth, the bird and insect voices,
                  imperfectly expressed their own heart-happiness. The living turf softly pressed up
                  their feet. This was the fortunate hour that comes not twice. Happy those to whom
                  it comes at all! To live was such full bliss, every new movement overflowed the
                  cup. Joy was it to look on earth and sky; but to behold each other was heaven!
                  More life in a moment such as this, than in twenty years of scheming more
                  successful than Manetho's.</p>
               <p>They followed the same path Helen had walked the eve of her death; and presently
                  arrived at the old bench. Shadow and sunshine wrestled playfully over it, while
                  the green blood of the leaves overhead glowed vividly against the blue. Around the
                  bench the grass grew taller, as on a grave; and crisp lichens, gray and brown,
                  overspread its surface. Man had neglected it so long that Nature, overcoming her
                  diffidence towards his handiwork, had at length claimed it for her own.</p>
               <p>The glade was full of great golden dandelions, whose soft yellow crowns were
                  almost too heavy for the slender necks. The prince and princess of the fairy-tale
                  paused here, recognizing the spot as the most beautiful on earth,—albeit only
                  since their love's arrival. They seated themselves not on the bench, but on the
                  yet more primitive grass beside it. They had not spoken as yet. Balder plucked
                  some dandelions, and proceeded to twist them into a chain; and Gnulemah, after
                  watching him for a while, followed his example.</p>
               <p>"You and I have sat on the grass and woven such chains before," asserted she at
                  length. "When was it?"</p>
               <p>"I haven't done such a thing since I was a child not much taller than a
                  dandelion," returned Balder. He was not ethereal enough to follow Gnulemah in her
                  apparently fanciful flight, else might he have lighted on a discovery to which all
                  the good sense and logic in the world would not have brought him.</p>
               <p>"Yes; we have made these chains before!" reiterated Gnulemah, looking at her
                  companion in a<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6660-00000163"/> preoccupied manner.
                  "They were to have chained us together forever."</p>
               <p>"We should have made them of stronger stuff, then. But which of us broke the
                  chain?"</p>
               <p>"They took us away from each other, and it was never finished. Do you remember
                  nothing?"</p>
               <p>"The present is enough for me," said her lover; and he finished his necklace with
                  a handsome clasp of blossoms, and threw it over her neck. She gave a low sigh of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"I have been waiting for it ever since that old time! And here is mine for
                  you."</p>
               <p>Thus adorned by each other's hands, their love seemed greater than before, and
                  they laughed from pure delight. Their bonds looked fragile; yet it would need a
                  stronger wrench to part them than had they been cables of iron or gold,
                  unsustained by the subtile might of love.</p>
               <p>"Let us link them together," proposed Balder; and, loosening a link of his chain,
                  he reunited it inside Gnulemah's. "We must keep together," he continued with a
                  smile, "or the marriage-bonds will break."</p>
               <p>"Is this marriage, Balder? to be tied together with flowers?"</p>
               <p>"One part of marriage. It shows the world that we belong only to each other."</p>
               <p>"How could they help knowing that,—for to whom else could we belong? besides, why
                  should they know?"</p>
               <p>"Because," answered Balder after some consideration, "the world is made in such a
                  way, that unless we record all we do by some visible symbol, everything would get
                  into confusion."</p>
               <p>"No, no," protested Gnulemah, earnestly. "Only God should know how we love. Must
                  the world know our words and thoughts, and how we have sat beneath these
                  trees?—Then let us not be married!"</p>
               <p>They were leaning side to side against the bench, along whose edge Balder had
                  stretched an arm to cushion Gnulemah's head. As he turned to look at her, a dash
                  of sunlight was quivering on her clear smooth cheek, and another ventured to
                  nestle warmly below the head of the guardian serpent on her bosom, for Gnulemah
                  and the sun had been lovers long before Balder's appearance. Where breathed such
                  another woman? From the low turban that pressed her hair to the bright sandals on
                  her fine bronze feet, there was no fault, save her very uniqueness. She belonged
                  not to this era, but to the Golden Age, past or to come. Could she ever be
                  conformed to the world of to-day? Dared her lover assume the responsibility of
                  revealing to this noble soul all the meanness, sophistries, little pleasures, and
                  low aims of this imperfect age? Could<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6660-00000164"/>
                  he change the world to suit her needs? or endure to see her change to suit the
                  world? Moreover, changing so much, might she not change towards him? The Balder
                  she loved was a grander man than any Balder knew. Might she not learn to abhor the
                  hand which should unveil to her the Gorgon features of fallen humanity?—Much has
                  man lost in losing Paradise!</p>
               <p>Contemplating Gnulemah's entrance into the outer world, Manetho had anticipated
                  her ruin from the flowering of the evil seed which he believed himself to have
                  planted in her. Might not the same result issue from a precisely opposite cause?
                  The Arcadian fashion in which the lovers' passion had ripened must soon change
                  forever. It was perilous to advance, but to retreat was impossible. Balder was at
                  bay; had he loved Gnulemah less, he would have regretted Charon's ferry-boat. But
                  his love was greater for the danger and difficulty wherewith it was fraught. He
                  could not summon the millennium; well, he might improve himself.</p>
               <p>"If I could but shut her glorious eyes to all the shabby littleness they will have
                  to see, we might hazard the rest," he sighed to himself. "If the pure visions of
                  her maiden years might veil from her those gross realities of every-day life! With
                  what face shall I meet her glance after it has suffered the first shock?"</p>
               <p>Meanwhile her last objection remained unanswered, and Balder, distrustful of his
                  capacity, was inspired to seek inspiration from her he would instruct.</p>
               <p>"Tell me how you love me, Gnulemah," said he.</p>
               <p>She roused herself, and bending her face to his, breathlessly kissed his lips.
                  Then she drooped her warm cheek on his shoulder, and whispered the rest:—</p>
               <p>"My love is to be near you, and to breathe when you breathe; it is love to become
                  you, as water becomes wave. And love would make me sweet to you, as honey and
                  music and flowers. I love to be needed by you, as you need food and drink and
                  sleep; and my love will be loved, as God loves the world."</p>
               <p>To the lover these sentences were tender and sublime poetry. The tears came to his
                  eyes, hearing her speak out her loving soul so simply. He had travelled through
                  the world, while she had lived her life between a wall and a precipice. But not
                  the noisy, gaudy, gloomy crust which is fresh to-day, and to-morrow hardens, and
                  the next day crumbles, is the world; but the fire-globe within: and Gnulemah was
                  nearer that fire than Balder. There was puissance in her simplicity,—in her
                  ignorance of that crust which he had so widely studied. Her knowledge was more
                  profound than his, for she had never learned to stultify it with reasons.</p>
               <p>"It is true,—God only can know our love," said<pb n="328-329"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000165"/> Balder, and, having said it, he felt his mind clear
                  and strengthen. For it is the acknowledgment of God that lends the deepest seeing
                  to the eye, and tunes the universe to man; and Balder, at this moment of mingled
                  love, humility, and fear, made and confessed that supreme discovery.—"Only He
                  knows what our love is, but the marriage-rite informs the world that He knows
                  it."</p>
               <p>"But why must the world know?" persisted Gnulemah, still seeming to shrink at the
                  idea.</p>
               <p>"Because it is wholesome for all men to know that we have made God party to our
                  union. That our love may be pure and immortal, we must look through each other to
                  Him; the acknowledgment will keep others as well as ourselves from misusing love's
                  happiness."</p>
               <p>"Then, after we have knelt together before Him, we shall be no longer two, but
                  one!" Gnulemah spoke, after some pause, in a full tone of joy; yet her voice
                  shrank at the last, from the feeling that she had penetrated all at once to a holy
                  place. A delicious fear seized her, and she clung to her lover so that he could
                  perceive the tremor that agitated her.</p>
               <p>No more was said. Their confidence was in each other; with Balder at her side,
                  Gnulemah was fearful of the world no longer. But her visions were all spiritual;
                  even the kisses on her lips were to her a sacred miracle! Love makes children of
                  men and women,—shows them the wisdom of unreason and the value of soap-bubbles.
                  These lovers must meet the world, but the light and freshness of the Golden Age
                  should accompany them. The man held the maiden's hand, and so faced the future
                  with a smile.</p>
               <p>Few as were the hours since they first had seen each other, it seemed as though
                  they could hardly know each other better; then why put off the consummation a
                  single hour? Manetho had been right, and Balder marvelled at having required the
                  spur. He knew of no material hindrances; unlimited resources would be his, and
                  these would render easier Gnulemah's introduction to society. Perhaps (for
                  doubtless Manetho would desire it) they might begin housekeeping in this very
                  house, and thus, by gradual approaches, make their way to life's
                  realities,—vulgarly so called!</p>
               <p>At this moment, Balder's respect for wealth was many fold greater than ever it had
                  been before. It should be the sword and shield wherewith he would protect the
                  woman of his heart. Gnulemah was not of the kind who need the discipline of
                  poverty; her beauty and goodness would be best nurtured beneath an affluent sun.
                  Wants and inconveniences would rather pain and mystify than educate her. How good
                  was that God who had vouchsafed not only the blessing, but the means of enjoying
                  it!</p>
               <p>God gave Balder Helwyse opportunity to prove the<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000166"/> soundness of his faith. Labor and poverty awaited
                  him; what else and worse let time show. In anguish, fear, and humiliation had his
                  love been born, but the birth-pangs had been as brief as they were intense. A
                  brave soul's metal is more severely tried by crawling years of monotonous effort,
                  discord of must with wish, and secret self-suppression and misgiving. Happily life
                  is so ordered that no blow can crush unless dealt from within, nor is any sunshine
                  worth having that shines only from without.</p>
               <p>Balder's eyes were softer than their wont, and there was a tender and sweet
                  expression about his mouth. Never had life been so inestimable a blessing,—never
                  had nature looked so divinely alive. He could imagine nothing gloomy or
                  forbidding; in darkness's self he would have found germs of light. His love was a
                  panoply against ill of mind or body. He thought he perceived, once for all, the
                  insanity of selfishness and sin.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he was conscious through Gnulemah of the same shiver that had visited her
                  in the conservatory that morning. Looking round, he was startled to see, beyond
                  the near benison of her sumptuous face, the tall form of the Egyptian priest. He
                  was not a dozen yards away, advancing slowly towards them. Balder sprang up.</p>
               <p>"Our chain,—you have broken it!" exclaimed Gnulemah. It was only a flower chain,
                  but flowers are the bloom and luxury of life.</p>
               <p>Manetho came up with a smile.</p>
               <p>"Come, my children!" said he. "This chain would soon have faded and fallen apart
                  of itself, but the chain I will forge you is stronger than time and weightier than
                  dandelions. Come!"</p>
               <p>Gnulemah picked up the broken links, and they followed him to the house.</p>

               <head>XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">MARRIED.</head>
               <p>THE significant part of most life histories is the record of a few detached hours,
                  the rest being consequence and preparation. Helwyse had lived in constant mental
                  and physical activity from childhood up; but though he had speculated much, and
                  ever sought to prove the truth by practice, yet he had failed to create adequate
                  emergencies, and was like an untried sword, polished and keen, but lacking still
                  the one stern proof of use.</p>
               <p>Thus, although a man of the world, in a deeper sense he was untouched by it. He
                  had been the sentimental spectator of a drama wherein some shadow of himself
                  seemed to act. The mimic scenes had sometimes moved him to laughter or to tears,
                  but he had never quite lost the suspicion of an unreality under all. The best end
                  had been—in a large sense—beauty. Beauty of love, of goodness, of strength, of
                  wisdom,—beauty of every kind and degree, but nothing better! Beauty was the end
                  rather than the trait of all desirable things. To have power was beautiful, and
                  beautiful tiful was the death that opened the way to freer and wider power. Most
                  beautiful was Almightiness; yet, lapsing thence, it was beautiful to begin the
                  round again in fresh, new forms.</p>
               <p>This kind of spider-webs cannot outlast the suns and snows. Personal passion
                  disgusts one with brain-spun systems of the universe, and may even lead to a
                  mistrust of mathematics! One feels the overwhelming power of other than
                  intellectual interests; and discovers in himself a hitherto unsuspected universe,
                  profound as the mystery of God, where the cockle-shell of mental attainments is
                  lost like an asteroid in the abyss of space.</p>
               <p>What is the mind?—A little window, through which to gaze out upon the vast
                  heart-world: a window whose crooked and clouded pane we may diligently clean and
                  enlarge day by day; but, too often, the deep view beyond is mistaken for a picture
                  painted on the glass and limited by its sash! Let the window by all means expand
                  till the darksome house be transformed to a crystal palace! but shall homage be
                  paid the crystal? Of what value were its transparency, had God not built the
                  heavens and the earth?—</p>
               <p>Though Helwyse had failed to touch the core of life, and to recognize the awful
                  truth of its mysteries, he had not been conscious of failure. On the contrary he
                  had become disposed to the belief that he was a<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000168"/> being apart from the mass of men and above them:
                  one who could see round and through human plans and passions; could even be
                  separate from himself, and yield to folly with one hand, while the other jotted
                  down the moral of the spectacle. He was calm in the conviction that he could
                  measure and calculate the universe, and draw its plan in his commonplace book. God
                  was his elder brother,—himself in some distant but attainable condition. He
                  matched finity against the Infinite, and thereby cast away man's dearest
                  hope,—that of eternal progress towards the image of Divine perfection.</p>
               <p>Once, however, the bow had smitten his heart-strings with a new result of sound,
                  awakening fresh ideas of harmony. When Thor was swept to death by that Baltic
                  wave, Balder leapt after him, hopeless to save, but without demur! The sea hurled
                  him back alone. For many a month thereafter, strange lights and shadows flashed or
                  gloomed across his sky, and sounds from unknown abysses disquieted him. But all
                  was not quite enough; perhaps he was hewn from too stanch materials lightly to
                  change. Yet the sudden shock of his loss left its mark: the props of
                  self-confidence were a little unsettled; and the events whose course we have
                  traced were therefore able to shake them down.</p>
               <p>For Destiny rained her sharpest blows on Balder Helwyse all at once, and the
                  attack marks the turning-point of his life. She chose her weapons wisely. He was
                  beaten by tactics which a coarser and shallower nature would have slighted. He
                  sustained the onslaught for the most part with outward composure,—but bleeding
                  inwardly.</p>
               <p>His had been a vast egoism, rooted in his nature and trained by his philosophy. It
                  must die, if at all, violently, painfully, and—in silence. The truer and more
                  constant the soul, the more complete the destruction of its idol. Character is not
                  always the slow growth of years: often do the elements mingle long in formless
                  solution; some sudden jar causes them to spring at once to the definite crystal.
                  There had, hitherto, been a kind of impersonality about Balder, having its
                  ultimate ground in his blindness to the immutable unity of God. But so soon as his
                  eye became single, he stood pronounced in his individuality, less broadly
                  indifferent than of yore, but organized and firm.</p>
               <p>In this inert world the body pursues but imperfectly the processes of the soul.
                  These three days had made small change in Helwyse's face. His expression was less
                  serene than of yore, but pithier as well as more joyful. The humorous indifference
                  had given place to a kindlier humanity. Gone was the glance half satiric, half
                  sympathetic; but in its stead was something<pb n="336-337"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000169"/> thing warmer and more earnest. For the charity of
                  scepticism was substituted a sentiment less broad, but deeper and truer. It would
                  need an insight supernaturally keen to detect thus early these alterations in the
                  page of Balder's countenance; but their germs are there, to develop
                  afterwards.</p>
               <p>During this pause in our narrative, Helwyse was sitting at his chamber window,
                  awaiting the summons to the ceremony. The afternoon was far advanced, and the
                  landscape lay breathless beneath the golden burden of the lavish sun. The
                  bridegroom rose to his feet; surely the bride must be ready! Was that strange old
                  Nurse delaying her? Did she herself procrastinate? Balder was waxing
                  impatient!</p>
               <p>The clear outcry of the hoopoe startled the calm air, and that good little
                  messenger came fluttering in haste to the window. Round its neck was twined a
                  golden dandelion,—Gnulemah's love-token! With a knowing upturn of its bright
                  little eye, the bird submitted to being robbed of its decoration; then warbled a
                  keen good-by, and flew away.</p>
               <p>The lover behaved as foolishly towards the dandelion as a lover should. At last he
                  drew the stem through the button-hole of his velveteen jacket, and was ready to
                  answer in person the shy invitation it conveyed. The bride waited!</p>
               <p>His hand was on the latch, when some one knocked. He threw open the door,—and had
                  to look twice before recognizing Nurse. Her dingy anomalous drapery had been
                  exchanged for another sort of costume. Her scars strove to be hidden beneath the
                  yellow lace and crumpled feathers of an antique head-dress. She wore a satin gown
                  of an old fashion, whose pristine whiteness was much impaired by time. An aged
                  fan, ragged, but of tasteful pattern, dangled at her wrist. She resembled some
                  forgotten Ginevra, reappearing after an age's seclusion in the oaken chest. Her
                  aspect was painfully repellent, the more for this pathetic attempt at good looks.
                  The former unlovely garb had a sort of fitness to the blasted features; but so
                  soon as she forsook that uncanny harmony and tried to be like other women, she
                  became undesirably conspicuous.</p>
               <p>"The bridesmaid!" came to Balder's lips,—but did not pass them. He would not hurt
                  the poor creature's feelings by the betrayal of surprise or amusement. She was a
                  woman,—and Gnulemah was no more. According to his love for his wife, must he be
                  tender and gentle towards her sex.</p>
               <p>When, therefore, Nurse gave him to understand that she was to marshal him to the
                  altar, Balder, never more heroic than at that moment, offered her his arm, which
                  she accepted with an air of scarecrow gentility. Either the change of costume had
                  struck in, or it was<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6660-00000170"/> the symbol of
                  inward change. She seemed struggling against her torpor, her dimness and deadness.
                  She tried, perhaps, to recall the day when that dress was first put on,—the day of
                  Helen's marriage, when Salome had attended her mistress to the altar,—when she
                  hoped before many weeks to stand at an altar on her own account.—Not yet, Salome,
                  nor in this world. Perchance not in another; for they who maim their earthly lives
                  may not enjoy in heaven the happiness whose seed was not planted here. The injury
                  is justly irreparable; else had angels been immediately created.</p>
               <p>But Salome was practising deception on herself. Airs and graces which might have
                  suited a coquettish lady's-maid, but were in her a ghastly absurdity, did she
                  revive and perpetrate. Struggling to repress the ugly truth, she was in continual
                  dread of exposure. Fain would she dream for an hour of youth and beauty, knowing,
                  yet veiling the knowledge, that it was a dream. Divining her desire, Balder helped
                  out the masquerade as best he might. She was thankfully aware of his kindness, yet
                  shunned acknowledgment, as a too bare betrayal of the cause of thanks.</p>
               <p>As they passed a cracked cheval-glass in an intervening room, the bridesmaid stole
                  a glance at her reflection, flirting her fan and giving an imposing whisk to the
                  train of her gown. Helwyse, whom, three days before, this behavior would simply
                  have amused, felt only pitying sympathy to-day. Gnulemah was always before him,
                  and charmed his eyes and thoughts even to the hag on his arm. He brought himself
                  to address courteous and pleasant remarks to his companion, and to meet
                  unwincingly her one-eyed glance; and was as gallant as though her pretence had
                  been truth.</p>
               <p>On entering the conservatory, Nurse seemed as much agitated as though she, instead
                  of Gnulemah, were to be chief actress in the coming ceremony. At the Sphinx door
                  she relinquished Balder's arm, and, hurrying across the conservatory, vanished
                  behind Gnulemah's curtain. As she passed out of sight she threw a parting glance
                  over her shoulder. The action recalled Gnulemah's backward look of the day
                  previous, when she had fled at the sound of the closing door. What ugly fatality
                  suggested so fantastic a parallel between this creature and Balder's future
                  wife!</p>
               <p>He entered the temple, which glowed and sparkled like a sombre gem. Many-colored
                  lamps were hung on wires passing round the hall from pillar to massive pillar.
                  Their glare defined the strange character of the Egyptian architecture and
                  ornament; nevertheless, the place looked less real and substantial than in the
                  morning. It seemed the impalpable creation of an enchanter, which his wand would
                  anon dissolve into air once more!</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6660-00000171"/>
               <p>On each side the door sat a statue of polished red granite, with calm regular face
                  and hands on knees. Helwyse, who had not observed them before, fancied them
                  summoned as witnesses to the compact then to be solemnized. Doubtless they had
                  witnessed ceremonies not less solemn or imposing.</p>
               <p>On the black marble altar at the further end of the hall was burning some rich
                  incense, whose perfumed smoke, clambering heavily upwards, mingled with that of
                  the lamps beneath the ceiling. On the polished floor, in front, lay a rug of dark
                  blue cloth, heavily bordered with gold; upon it were represented in conscientious
                  profile a number of lank-limbed Egyptians performing some mystic rite. To the
                  right of the altar stood the priest Manetho, apparently engaged in prayer. Balder
                  spoke to him.</p>
               <p>"This is more like a tomb than a wedding hall. Would not the conservatory have
                  been more fitting?"</p>
               <p>"Better make a tomb the starting-point of marriage than its goal!" smiled the holy
                  man. "And is it not well that your posterity should begin from the spot which saw
                  the union that gave you being? and beneath the eyes of him but for whom neither
                  this hall nor we who here assemble would to-day have existed!" He pointed to the
                  mummy of old Hiero Glyphic, the aspect of which might have left a bad taste in the
                  mouth of Joy herself. Balder shrugged his shoulders.</p>
               <p>"It matters little, perhaps, where the seed is sown, so that the flower reach the
                  sunshine at last. But your mummy is an ill-favored wedding-guest, whatever honor
                  we may owe the man who once lived in it. I would not have Gnulemah—"</p>
               <p>"Behold her!" interrupted Manetho, speaking as though a handful of dust had
                  suddenly got in his throat.</p>
               <p>Yes, there she came, the old Nurse following her like a misshapen shadow. Daughter
                  of sun and moon,—a modern Pandora endowed with the strength of a loftier nature!
                  She was robed in creamy white; her pendants were woven pearls. Fine lines of
                  virgin gold gleamed in her turban, and through her long veil, and along the folds
                  of her girdle. But the serpent necklace had been replaced by the dandelion chain
                  that Balder had made her. Her lips and cheeks were daintily aflame, and a tender
                  fire flickered in her eyes, which saw only Balder. She was a bridal song such as
                  had not been sung since Solomon.</p>
               <p>As the two reached the altar, Salome stepped to one side, and Manetho's eye fell
                  upon her; for a moment his gaze fixed, while a slight movement undulated through
                  his body, as the wave travels along the cord. The old white dress, unseen for
                  five-and-twenty years; some intangible trick of motion or attitude in the wearer;
                  the occasion and circumstance recurring with<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000172"/> such near similarity,—these and perhaps other
                  trifles combined to recall long-vanished Salome. She had stood at that other
                  wedding, just where Nurse was now,—bright, shapely, sparkling-eyed, full of love
                  for him. What a grisly contrast was this!—Why had he thrown away that ardent,
                  loving heart? How sweet and comfortable might life have been to-day, with Salome
                  his wife, and sons and daughters at her side,—daughters beautiful as Gnulemah,
                  sons tall as Balder! But Hatred had been his chosen mistress, and dismal was the
                  progeny begotten on her! The pregnant existence that might have been his, and the
                  scars and barrenness which had actually redounded to him, were symbolized in the
                  remembered Salome and her of to-day.</p>
               <p>The brief reminiscence passed, leaving Manetho face to face with his sacred duty.
                  With the warning of the past in his ears and that of the future before his eyes,
                  did he step unrelenting across the threshold of his crime? At all events he
                  neither hesitated nor turned back. But there was no triumph in his eyes, and his
                  tones and manner were heavy and mechanical; as though the Devil (having brought
                  him thus far with his own consent and knowledge) had now to compel a frozen soul
                  in a senseless body!</p>
               <p>The service began, none the less hallowed for the lovers, because for Manetho it
                  was the solemn perversion sion of a sacred ceremony. His voice labored through the
                  perfumed air, and recoiled in broken echoes from gloomy corners and deep-tinted
                  walls. The encircling lamps glowed in serried lines of various light; the
                  fantastic incense-flame rustled softly on the altar. The four figures seemed a
                  group of phantoms,—a momentary rich illusion of the eye. And save for their
                  viewless souls, what were they more? Earth is a phantom; but what we cannot grasp
                  is real and remains!—</p>
               <p>The rite was over, the diamond gleamed from Gnulemah's finger, and the priest with
                  uplifted hands had bade man not part whom God had united. Husband and wife gazed
                  at each other with freshness and wonder in their eyes; as having expected to see
                  some change, and anew delighted at finding more of themselves than ever!</p>
               <p>Male and female pervades the universe, and marriage is the end and fulfilment of
                  creation. God has builded the world of love and wisdom, woman and man; truly to
                  live they must unite, she yielding herself to his form, he moulding himself of her
                  substance. As love unquickened by wisdom is barren, and knowledge impotent
                  unkindled by affection, so are the unmarried lifeless.</p>
               <p>Ill and bitter was it, therefore, for Manetho and Salome, after the married ones
                  had departed, taking their happiness with them. The priest's eyes were<pb
                     n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6660-00000173"/> dry and dull, as he leaned wearily
                  against the smoking altar.</p>
               <p>"You did not speak!" he said to the woman; "you saw her betrayed to ruin and
                  pollution, and spoke not to save her!—Dumb? the dead might have moved their
                  tongues in such need as this! She will abhor and curse me forever! may you share
                  her curse weighted with mine!—O Gnulemah!"—</p>
               <p>Salome cowered and trembled in her satin dress, beneath the burden of that heavy
                  anathema. She had risen that day determined to reveal the secret of her life
                  before night. She had been awaiting a favorable moment, but opportunity or
                  decision still had failed her. Nevertheless, another morning should not find her
                  the same nameless, forsaken creature that she was now.—Manetho had bowed his face
                  upon the altar, and so remained without movement. With one hand fumbling at the
                  bosom of her dress—(the scar of her lover's blow should be the talisman to recall
                  his allegiance),—Salome made bold to approach him and timidly touch his arm.</p>
               <p>"Unhand me! whatever you are,—devil! my time is not yet come!"</p>
               <p>He raised a threatening arm, with a gleam of mad ferocity beneath his brows. But
                  the woman did not shrink; the man was her god, and she preferred death at his
                  hands to life without him. Ignorant of the cause of her firmness, it seemed to cow
                  him. He slunk behind the altar, hurriedly unlocked the secret door, and let
                  himself into the study. His haste had left the key in the lock outside. The door
                  slammed together, the spring-bolt caught, and the swathed head of old Hiero
                  Glyphic shook as though the cold of twenty winters had come on him at once.</p>

               <head>XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">SHUT IN.</head>
               <p>LEFT alone, Salome was taken with a panic; she fancied herself deserted in a giant
                  tomb, with dead men gathering about her. She herself was in truth the grisliest
                  spectre there, in her white satin gown and feathers, and the horror of her hideous
                  face. But she took to flight, and the key remained unnoticed in the lock.</p>
               <p>We, however, must spend an hour with Manetho in his narrow and prison-like
                  retreat. There is less day and more night between these high-shouldered walls than
                  elsewhere; for though the sun is scarce below the horizon, cobwebs seem to pervade
                  the air, making the evening gray before its time. Yonder seated figure is the
                  nucleus of the gloom. The room were less dark and oppressive, but for him!</p>
               <p>Does he mean to spend the night here? He sits at ease, as one who, having labored
                  the day long hard and honestly, finds repose at sundown grateful. Such calm of
                  mind and body argues inward peace—or paralysis!</p>
               <p>But Manetho has food for meditation, for his work is still incomplete. Ah, it has
                  been but a sour and anxious work after all! when it is finished, let death come,
                  since Death-in-life will be the sole alternative. Yet will death bring rest to
                  your weariness, think you? Would not Death's eyes look kindlier on you, if you had
                  used more worthily Death's brother,—Life? What would you give, Manetho, to see all
                  that you have done undone? if to undo it were possible!</p>
               <p>One picture is ever before you,—you see it wherever you look, and whether your
                  eyes be shut or open,—two loving souls, standing hand in hand before you to be
                  married. How happy they look! how nobly confident is their affection! with what
                  clear freedom their eyes sound one another's depths! Neither cares to have a
                  thought or feeling unshared by the other.—What have you done, Manetho?—shall the
                  deed stand? O dark and distorted soul! the minutes are slipping fast away, and you
                  are slipping with them to a black eternity. Will you stir hand nor foot to save
                  yourself, to break your fall? not raise your voice, for once to speak the truth?
                  Even yet the truth may save!—</p>
               <p>The night of your life will this be, Manetho. Will you dream of those whose few
                  hours of bliss will stamp Forever on the seal of your damnation? Think,—through
                  what interminable æons the weight of their just curse will pile itself higher and
                  heavier on your<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6660-00000175"/> miserable soul! Fain
                  would you doubt the truth of immortality: but the power of unbelief is gone;
                  devil-like, you believe and tremble. And where is the reward which should
                  recompense you for this large outlay? Does the honey of your long-awaited triumph
                  offend your lips like gall?—Then woe for him whose morning dreams of vengeance
                  become realities in the evening!—</p>
               <p>How stands it between you and Gnulemah, Manetho? She has never loved you ardently,
                  perhaps; but how will you face her hatred? It is late to be asking such
                  questions,—but has not her temperate affection been your most precious possession?
                  have you not yearned and labored for it? have you not loved her with more than a
                  father's tenderness? Under mask of planning her ruin, have not all the softer and
                  better impulses of your nature found exercise and sustenance? Conceiving a devil,
                  have you brought forth an angel, and unawares tasted angelic joy?—If this be true,
                  Manetho, your guilty purpose towards her is not excused, but how much more awful
                  becomes the contemplation of her fate! Rouse up! sluggard, rush forth! you may
                  save her yet. Up! would you risk the salvation of three souls to glut a
                  meaningless spite? You have been fighting shadows with a shadow. Up!—it is the
                  last appeal.—</p>
               <p>You stir,—get stiffly to your feet,—put hand to forehead,—stare around. The
                  twilight has deepened apace; only by glancing upwards can you distinguish a
                  definite light. You are uncertain and lethargic in your movements, as though the
                  dawning in you of a worthy resolution had impaired the evil principle of your
                  vitality. You are as a man nourished on poison, who suddenly tastes an
                  antidote,—and finds it fatal!</p>
               <p>You halt towards the door and put forth a hand to open it. You will save Gnulemah;
                  her innocence will save her from the knowledge of her loss. As for Balder,—his
                  suffering will satisfy a reasonable enemy. No wife, no fortune, the cup dashed
                  from his lips just as the aroma was ravishing his nostrils!—O, enough! Open the
                  door, therefore, and go forth.</p>
               <p>In your magnanimity you feel for the key, but it is not in its accustomed place.
                  Try your pockets; still in vain! Startled, you turn to the table, and feel
                  carefully over it from end to end. You raise the heavy chair like a feather, and
                  shake it bottom downwards. Nothing falls. You are down on your knees groping
                  affrighted amongst the dust and rubbish of the floor. The key is lost! You spring
                  up,—briskly enough now,—and stand with your long fingers working against one
                  another, trying to think. That key,—where had you it last?—</p>
               <p>A blank whirl is your memory,—nothing stands clearly out. How came you here? With
                  whom did<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6660-00000176"/> you speak just now? What was
                  said?—Two persons there seemed to be, oddly combined in one,—most unfamiliar in
                  their familiarity. Or was it your evil genius, Manetho? who by devilish artifice
                  has at this last hour shut the door against your first good impulse; locked the
                  door against soul and body; shut you in and carried off the key of your
                  salvation.</p>
               <p>Do not give way yet; review your situation carefully.—Your voice would be
                  inaudible through these massive walls, were the listener but a yard away.—Be quick
                  with your thinking, for the unmitigable minutes are dying fast and forever.—Were
                  it known that you were here, could you be got out? No, for the secret of the door
                  is known only to yourself. Those who once shared the knowledge with you are dead,
                  or many years gone! Your evil genius no doubt knows it, and all your secrets; but
                  dream not that she will liberate you. She has been awaiting this opportunity. You
                  shall remain here to-night and many nights. Your bones shall lie gaunt on this
                  cobwebbed floor. Only the daily sunbeam shall know of your tomb. And
                  Gnulemah?...</p>
               <p>Your knees falter beneath you, and you sink in wretched tears to the floor,—tears
                  that bring no drop of comfort. To be shut up alone with a soul like yours, at the
                  moment when the sin so long tampered with has escaped your control, and is
                  pitilessly doing its devilish work on the other side your prison-walls, near, yet <choice>
                     <sic>inacessible</sic>
                     <corr>inaccessible</corr>
                  </choice>,—who can measure the horror of it? Till now you have made your will the
                  law of right and wrong, and read your life by no higher light than your own. You
                  read it otherwise to-night, lying here helpless and alone. That lost key has
                  unlocked the fair front of your complacency and revealed the wizened deformity
                  behind it. You have been insane; but the anguish that would craze a sane man
                  clears the mist from your reason. You behold the truth at last; but as the
                  drowning man sees the ship pass on and leave him.</p>
               <p>But we care not to watch too curiously the writhings of your imprisoned soul,
                  Manetho; the less, because we doubt whether the agony will be of benefit to you.
                  Forgiveness of enemies is perhaps beyond your scope; even your rage to save
                  Gnulemah was kindled chiefly by your impotence to do so. God forbid we do you less
                  than justice! but hope seems dim for such as you; nor will a death-bed repentance,
                  however sincere, avail to wipe away the sins of a lifetime. Jealousy of Balder,
                  rather than desire for Gnuelmah's eternal weal, awoke your conscience. For the
                  thought of their spending life in happy ignorance of their true relationship
                  inflames—does not allay—your agony!</p>
               <p>Your womanish outburst of despairing tears over, a<pb n="352-353"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000177"/> hot fever of restlessness besets you. The space is
                  narrow for disquiet such as yours,—you hunt up and down the strip of floor like a
                  caged beast. No way out,—no way out!—Face to face with lingering death, why not
                  hasten it? No moral scruple withholds you. Yet will you not die by your own hand.
                  Through all your suffering you will cling to life and worship it. Never will you
                  open your arms to death,—which seems to you no grave, compassionate angel, but a
                  malignant fiend lying in ambush for your soul. And such a fiend will your death
                  be; for to all men death is the reflection of their life in the mind's
                  mirror.—Still to and fro you fare, a moving shadow through a narrow gloom, walled
                  in with stone.</p>
               <p>Awful is this unnatural sanity of intellect: it is like the calm in the
                  whirlwind's centre, where the waves run higher though the air is deadly still, and
                  the surly mariner wishes the mad wind back again.—To and fro you flit, goaded on
                  and strengthened by untiring anguish. You are but the body of a man; your thought
                  and emotion are abroad, haunting the unconscious, happy lovers!—</p>
               <p>Suddenly you stop short in your blind walk, throw up your arms, and break into an
                  irrepressible chuckle. Has your brain given way at last?—No, your laugh is the
                  outcome of a genuine revulsion of feeling, intense but legitimate. What is the
                  cause of it?—You plunge into the rubbish-heap at one end of the room, and grasp
                  and draw forth the rickety old ladder which has been lying there these twenty
                  years. You have seen it almost daily, poking out amidst the cobwebs, and probably
                  for that very reason have so long failed to perceive that it was susceptible of a
                  better use than to be food for worms. You set it upright against the wall; its top
                  round falls three feet below the horizontal aperture. Enough, if you tread with
                  care. Narrow, steep, and rickety is the path to deliverance; but up! for your time
                  is short.</p>
               <p>Upward, with cautious eagerness! The ladder is warped and rests unevenly, and once
                  or twice a round cracks beneath the down-pressing foot; the thing is all unsound
                  and might fall to pieces at any moment. However, the top is gained, and your
                  nervous hands are on the sill at last. Raising yourself a little higher, you look
                  forth on the world once more.</p>
               <p>Not so late after all! Red still lingers along the western horizon, but against it
                  is mounting and expanding a black cloud, glancing ever and anon with dangerous
                  lightning. In a clear sky-lake above the cloud, steadily burns a planet. The
                  gentle twilight rests lovingly on earth's warm bosom—</p>
               <p>Hark! look! what moves yonder beneath the trees?—</p>
               <p>Your parched, eager face strained forwards, your hungry<pb n="354-355"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000178"/> gry eyes eating through the gloom,—see emerge from
                  the avenue two figures, sauntering lover-like side to side! How forgetful of the
                  world they seem! Little think they of you, of the rack on which you have been
                  outstretched. But their hour has come. This moment shall be their last of
                  peace,—their last of happy love.</p>
               <p>—What sound was that?—Was it a yell of triumph,—a shout for help,—a scream of
                  terror?—It does not come again; but the silence is more terrible than the cry.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE BLACK CLOUD.</head>
               <p>"HIERO,—it was his voice!" said Gnulemah. She looked in her lover's face, trusting
                  to his wisdom and strength. She rested her courage on his, but her eyes stirred
                  him like a trumpet-call. The burden of that cry had been calamity. Love is
                  protean,—makes but a step from dalliance to grandeur. Balder, no longer a
                  sentimental bridegroom, stood forth ready, brief, energetic,—but more a lover than
                  before!</p>
               <p>The voice had at the first moment sounded startlingly clear, then it had seemed
                  distant and muffled. As Helwyse swiftly skirted the granite wall of the temple,
                  his mind was busy with conjecture; but he failed to hit upon any reasonable
                  explanation. The cry had come from the direction of the temple, and had he known
                  of the existence of the apertures through the masonry, he might partly have solved
                  the mystery. As it was, he thought only of getting inside, feeling sure that,
                  explainably or not, Manetho must be there.</p>
               <p>In the oaken hall he met Nurse, who had also heard the cry, but knew not whence it
                  proceeded.</p>
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6660-00000179"/>
               <p>"In the temple, I think," said Helwyse, answering her agitated gesture.</p>
               <p>The clew was sufficient; she sped along towards the door whence she had so lately
                  fled panic-stricken, Helwyse following. Beneath the solemn excitement and
                  perplexity, lay warm and secure in his heart the thought of Gnulemah,—his wife.
                  Blessed thought! which the whips and scorns of time should make but more tenderly
                  dear and precious.</p>
               <p>As he breathed the incense-laden air of the temple, Balder's face grew stern. At
                  each step he thought to see death in some ghastly form. In the joy of this his
                  marriage night he had wished all the world might have rejoiced with him; but
                  already was calamity abroad. Birth and death, love and hate, happiness and woe,
                  are borne on every human breath, and mingled with daily meat and drink. So be
                  it!—They were parodies of humanity who should live on a purer diet or inhale a
                  rarer atmosphere.</p>
               <p>All the lights in the great hall, except the altar-lamp, were burnt out, and the
                  place was very dusky. Nurse went straight towards the secret door, looking neither
                  to the right nor left; while Helwyse, who did not suspect its existence, was
                  prying into each dark nook and corner. An inarticulate exclamation from the woman
                  arrested him. She was standing behind the altar, close to the clock. As he
                  approached she pointed to the wall. She had found the key in the lock, but dared
                  not be first to brave the sight of what might be within. She appealed to the
                  strength of the man, yet with a morbid jealousy of his precedence.</p>
               <p>Helywse saw the key, and, turning it, the seeming-solid wall disclosed a door,
                  opening outwards, a single slab of massive granite. Within all was dark, and there
                  was no sound. Was anything there?</p>
               <p>He looked round to address Nurse, but her appearance checked him. She was staring
                  into the darkness; he could feel her one-eyed glance pass him, fastening on
                  something beyond. He moved to let the lamplight enter the doorway; and then in the
                  illuminated square that fell on the floor he saw Manetho's upturned face. The
                  fallen priest lay with one arm doubled under him, the other thrown across his
                  breast. Nurse stared at her broken idol, motionless, with stertorous
                  breathing.</p>
               <p>But was Manetho dead? Helwyse, the physician, stepped across the threshold, and
                  stooped to examine the body. The dumb creature followed and lay down, animal-like,
                  close beside the deity of her worship. Presently the physician said,—</p>
               <p>"There's life in him, but he's hurt internally. We must find a way to move him
                  from here."</p>
               <p>"Life!"—the woman heard, nor cared for more. Her dry fixedness gave way with a
                  gasp, and she<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6660-00000180"/> broke into hysteric
                  tears, rocking herself backwards and forwards, crooning over the insensible body,
                  or stooping to kiss it. She had no sense nor heed save for the lover of her
                  youth.</p>
               <p>"Could such a creature have been his wife? or even his mistress?" questioned
                  Helwyse of himself. But he spoke out sharply:—</p>
               <p>"You must stop this. He must be revived at once. Go and make ready a bed, and I
                  will carry him to it."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, a silent shadow fell across the body, and Gnulemah stood in the
                  doorway. Balder's first impulse was to motion her away from a spectacle so
                  unsuited to her eyes. But though the shadow made her face inscrutable, the lines
                  of her figure spoke,—and not of weak timidity or effeminate consternation. Womanly
                  she was,—instinct with that tender, sensitive power, the marvellous gift of God to
                  woman only, which almost moves the sick man to bless his sickness. A holy
                  gift,—surely the immediate influx of Christ's spirit. Man knows it not, albeit
                  when he and woman have become more closely united than now, he may attain to share
                  the Divine prerogative. Study nor skill can counterfeit it; but in the true woman
                  it is perfect at the first appeal as at the last.</p>
               <p>"He shall have my bed," said this young goddess Isis; "it is ready, and my lamp is
                  burning."</p>
               <p>Balder stooped to uplift his insensible burden.</p>
               <p>"O, not so!—more tenderly than that," she interposed, softly. A moment's
                  hesitation, and then she unfastened the golden shoulder-clasp, and shook off her
                  ample mantle. This was Manetho's litter.</p>
               <p>"I will help you carry him.—Why do you weep, Nurse? he will awake, or Balder would
                  have told us."</p>
               <p>Never, since Diana stooped to earth to love Endymion, was seen a nobler sight than
                  Gnulemah in her simple, clinging tunic, whose heavy golden hem kissed her polished
                  knee, while her round and clear-cut arms were left bare. After the first glance,
                  her lover lowered his eyes, lest he should forget all else in gazing at her. But
                  the blood mounted silently to his cheeks and burned there. As for her,—she trusted
                  Balder more freely than herself.</p>
               <p>Manetho was laid gently on the broad robe, and so upraised and borne forwards;
                  Balder at the head, Gnulemah at the foot. Heavy, heavy is a lifeless body; but the
                  man had cause to wonder at the woman's fresh and easy strength. What a contrast
                  was she to the disfigured creature who hobbled moaning beside the litter, the
                  relaxed hand clutched in both hers, kissing it again and again with grotesque
                  passion! Yet both were women, and loved as women love.</p>
               <p>The granite statues sitting serene at the doorway maintained the stony calm which,
                  only, deserves the name of supernatural. These passed, the flowery heat<pb
                     n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6660-00000181"/> of the dim conservatory brought them to
                  Gnulemah's room. The curtain was looped up and the passage clear. Thus first did
                  the wedded pair enter what should have been their bridal chamber, and laid the
                  lifeless body on the nuptial bed.</p>
               <p>A fair, pure room; the clear walls frescoed with graceful wreaths of floating
                  figures. In the eastern window, through which the earliest sunbeams loved to fall,
                  stood an alabaster altar; on it a chain of faded dandelions. The bed was a lovely
                  nest, the lines flowing in long curves,—a barge of Venus for lovers to voyage to
                  heaven in. On a table near at hand lay some embroidered work at which Gnulemah's
                  magic needle had been busy of late. Balder glanced at these things with a
                  reverence almost timid; and, turning back to what lay so inert and doltish on the
                  sacred bed, he could not but sigh.</p>
               <p>Every means was employed to rally the Egyptian from his swoon. He bore no external
                  marks of injury, but there could be no doubt that he had sustained a terrible
                  shock, and possibly concussion of the brain; the amount of the internal damages
                  could not yet be estimated.—Meanwhile the black cloud from the west was muttering
                  drowsily overhead, and an occasional lightning-flash dulled the mild radiance of
                  the lamp. As consciousness ebbed back to the patient, the storm increased, and the
                  trembling roll of heavy thunder drowned the first gasps of returning life. Had
                  that vast cloud come to shut out his soul from heaven, and was its mighty voice
                  uttering the sentence of his condemnation? The air was thick with the inconsolable
                  weeping of the rain, and gusty sighs of wind drove its cold tear-drops against the
                  window.</p>
               <p>How was it with Manetho?—During the instant after the ladder had given way and he
                  was rushing through the air and clutching vainly at the dark void, every faculty
                  had violently expanded, so that he seemed to see and think at every pore. The next
                  instant his rudely battered body refused to bear the soul's messages; light and
                  knowledge sank into bottomless darkness.</p>
               <p>By and by—for aught he knew it might have been an eternity—a brief gleam divided
                  the night; then another, and others; he seemed to be moving through air, upborne
                  on a cloud. He strove to open his eyes, and caught a glimpse of reeling walls,—of
                  a figure,—figures. A deep rumbling sound was in his ears, as of the rolling
                  together of chaotic rocks, gradually subsiding into stillness.</p>
               <p>He felt no pain, only dreamy ease. He was resting softly on a bank of flowers, in
                  the heart of a summer's day. He was filled with peace and love, and peace and love
                  were around him. Some one was nestling beside him; was it not the woman,—the
                  bright-eyed, smiling<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6660-00000182"/> ing gypsy with
                  whom he had plighted troth?—surely it was she.</p>
               <p>"Salome,—Salome, are you here? Touch me,—lay your cheek by mine. So,—give me your
                  hand. I love you, my pretty pet,—your Manetho loves you!"</p>
               <p>The slow sentences ended. Nurse had laid her unsightly head beside his on the
                  pillow, and the two were happy in each other. O piteous, revolting, solemn sight!
                  Those faces, grief-smitten, old; long ago, in passionate and lawless youth, they
                  had perchance lain thus and murmured loving words. And now for a moment they met
                  and loved again,—while death knocked at their chamber door!</p>
               <p>But Balder had perceived a startling significance in Manetho's words. He took
                  Gnulemah by the hand and led her to the eastern window. A flash greeted them,
                  creating a momentary world, which started from the womb of night, and vanished
                  again before one could say "It is there!" Then followed a long-drawn, intermittent
                  rumble, as if the fragments of the spectre world were tumbling avalanche-wise into
                  chaos.</p>
               <p>"I remember now about the dandelions," Balder said. "Was not Nurse with us
                  then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Gnulemah; "and it was she and Hiero who took me from you. But why
                  does he call her Salome? and who is Manetho?"</p>
               <p>Balder did not reply. He leant against the window-frame frame and gazed out into
                  the black storm. Knowing what he now did, it required no great stretch of
                  ingenuity to unravel Manetho's secret.—He turned to Gnulemah, and, taking her in
                  his arms, kissed her with a defiant kind of ardor.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" she whispered, clinging to him with a reflex of his own unspoken
                  emotion.</p>
               <p>"We are safe!—But that man shall not die without hearing the truth," he added,
                  sternly.</p>
               <p>Again there was a dazzling lightning-flash, and the thunder seemed to break at
                  their very ears. By a quick, sinuous movement, Gnulemah freed herself from his arm
                  and looked at him with her grand eyes,—night-black, lit each with a sparkling
                  star. Her feminine intuition perceived a change in him, though she could not
                  fathom its cause. It jarred the fineness of their mutual harmony.</p>
               <p>"Our happiness should make others' greater," said she.</p>
               <p>He looked into her eyes with a gaze so ardent that their lids drooped; and the
                  tone of his answer, though lover-like, had more of masculine authority in it than
                  she had yet heard from him.</p>
               <p>"My darling, you do not know what wrong he has done you—and others. It is only
                  justice that he should learn how God punishes such as he!"</p>
               <p>"Will not God teach him?" said Gnulemah, trembling<pb n="364-365"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000183"/> bling to oppose the man she loved, yet by love
                  compelled to do so.</p>
               <p>Balder paused, and looked towards the bed. There was a flickering smile on
                  Manetho's face; he seemed to be reviving. His injuries were perhaps not fatal
                  after all. Should he recover, he must sooner or later receive his so-called
                  punishment; meanwhile, Balder was inclined to regard himself as the chosen
                  minister of Divine justice. Why not speak now?</p>
               <p>This was the second occasion that he had held Manetho in his power, at a time when
                  the Egyptian had been attempting his destruction. In the previous encounter he had
                  retaliated in kind. Would the bitter issue of that self-indulgence not make him
                  wary now? Here was again the murderous lust of power, albeit disguised as love of
                  justice. Had Balder's penitent suffering failed to teach him the truth of human
                  brotherhood, and equality before God? Love, typified by Gnulemah, would fain
                  dissuade him from his purpose: but love (as often happens when it stands in the
                  way of harsh and ignoble impulses) appeared foolishly merciful.</p>
               <p>Once again his glance met Gnulemah's,—lingered a moment,—and then turned away. It
                  was for the last time. At that moment he was less noble than ever before. But the
                  expression of her eyes he never forgot; the love, the entreaty, the grandeur,—the
                  sorrow!—</p>
               <p>He turned away and approached the bedside, while Gnulemah went to kneel at her
                  maiden altar. Manetho's eyes were closed; his features wore a singularly childlike
                  expression. In truth, he was but half himself; the shock he had sustained had
                  paralyzed one part of his nature. The subtle, evil-plotting Egyptian was dormant;
                  his brain interpreted nothing save the messages of the heart; only the
                  affectionate, emotional Manetho was awake. The evil he had done and the misery of
                  it were forgotten.—All this Balder divined; yet his assumption of godlike
                  censorship would not permit him to relent. It is when man deems himself most
                  secure that he falls, in a worse way than ever.</p>
               <p>"Do you know me, Manetho?" demanded the young man.</p>
               <p>The priest opened his eyes dreamily, and smiled, but made no further answer.</p>
               <p>"I am Balder Helwyse,—the son of Thor," continued the other, speaking with
                  incisive deliberation, the better to touch the stunned man's apprehension. "I once
                  had a twin sister. You believe that Gnulemah is she."</p>
               <p>The priest's features were getting a bewildered, plaintive expression. Either he
                  was beginning to comprehend the purport of Balder's words, or else the sternness
                  of the latter's tone and glance agitated him.</p>
               <p>Balder concentrated all his force into the utterance<pb n="366-367"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000184"/> of the final sentences, vowing to himself that his
                  fallen enemy should understand! Did he think of Gnulemah then? or of Salome—partly
                  for whose sake, as he feigned, he had assumed the scourge?</p>
               <p>"My sister died,—was burned to death before she was a year old. In trying to save
                  her, the nurse almost lost her own life. On that same night, this nurse gave birth
                  to a daughter,—whose name you have called Gnulemah. Salome is her mother. Who her
                  father is, Manetho, you best know!"</p>
               <p>The words were spoken,—but had the culprit heard them? Salome (who from the first
                  had shrunk back to the head of the bed, beyond the possible range of Manetho's
                  vision) burst into confused hysteric cries. Gnulemah had risen from her altar and
                  was looking at Balder: he felt her glance,—but though he told himself that he had
                  done but justice, he dared not meet it!—He kept his eyes fastened on the pallid
                  countenance of the Egyptian. The latter's breath came feebly and irregularly, but
                  the anxious expression was gone, and there was again the flickering smile. All at
                  once there was an odd, solemn change.—</p>
               <p>The man was dying. Balder saw it,—saw that his enemy was escaping him unpunished!
                  There yet remained one stimulant that might rouse him, and in the passion of the
                  moment this self-appointed lieutenant of the Almighty applied it.</p>
               <p>"Come forward here, Salome!" cried he; "let him look on the face that his sins
                  have given you. As there is a God in Heaven, your wrongs shall be set right!"</p>
               <p>Salome moved to obey; but Gnulemah glided swiftly up and held her back. Balder
                  stepped imperiously forward to enforce his will. Had he but answered his wife's
                  eyes even then!—He came forward one step.</p>
               <p>Then burst a thunder-clap like the crashing together of heaven and earth! At the
                  same instant a blinding, hot glare shut out all sight. Balder was hurled back
                  against the wall, a shock like the touch of death in every nerve.</p>
               <p>He staggered up, all unstrung, his teeth chattering. He saw,—not the lamp,
                  flickering in the draught from the broken window,—not Manetho, lying motionless
                  with the smile frozen on his lips,—not Salome, prostrate across the body of him
                  she had worshipped.</p>
               <p>He saw Gnulemah—his wife whom he loved—rise from the altar's step against which
                  she had been thrown; stand with outstretched arms and blank, wide-open eyes; grope
                  forwards with outstretched arms and uncertain feet; grope blindly this way and
                  that, moaning,—</p>
               <p>"Balder,—Balder,—where are you?"</p>
               <p>Shivering and desperate,—not yet daring for his life<pb n="368-369"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000185"/> to understand,—he came and stood before her, almost
                  within reach of those groping hands.</p>
               <p>"I am here,—look at me, Gnulemah!—I am here,—your husband!"</p>
               <p>There was a pause. The storm, having spent itself in that last burst, was rolling
                  heavily away. There was silence in the nuptial chamber, infringed only by the
                  breathing of the newly married lovers.</p>
               <p>"I hear you, Balder," said Gnulemah at length, tremulously, while her blank eyes
                  rested on his face, "but I cannot see you. My lamp must have gone out. Will not
                  you light it for me?"—</p>
               <p>Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord: I will repay!</p>
               <p>* * * * *</p>
               <p>The storm-cloud moved eastward and was dispersed. Black though had been its
                  shadow, it endured but for a moment; the echo of its fury passed away, and its
                  deadly thunderbolt left behind a purer atmosphere. So sweeps and rages over men's
                  heads the storm of calamity; and so dissolves, though seeming for the time
                  indissoluble.</p>
               <p>But the distant planet comes forth serene from its brief eclipse, and as night
                  deepens, bears its steady fire yet more aloft. Like God's love, its radiance
                  embraces the world, yet forgets not the smallest flower nor grain of sand. From
                  its high station it beholds the infinite day surround the night, and knows the
                  good before and beyond the ill. Great is its hope, for causes are not hidden from
                  its quiet eternal eye.</p>
               <p>No journal of a life has been our tale; rather a glimpse of a beginning! We have
                  traversed an alpine pass between the illimitable lands of Past and Future. We have
                  felt the rock rugged beneath our feet; have seen the avalanche and mused beside
                  the precipice, and have taken what relief we might in the scanty greensward, the
                  few flowers, and the brief sunshine. Now, standing on the farewell promontory, let
                  us question the magic mirror concerning the further road,—as, before, of that from
                  the backward horizon hitherwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. MacGentle's quiet little office: himself—more venerable by a year than when we
                  saw him last—in his chair: opposite him, Dr. Balder Helwyse. The latter wears a
                  thick yellow beard about six inches in length, is subdued in dress and manner, and
                  his smile, though genial, has something of the sadness of autumn sunshine. The two
                  have been conversing earnestly, and now there is a short silence.</p>
               <p>"We must give up hoping it, then," says Mr. MacGentle at last, in a more than
                  usually plaintive murmur. "It is hard,—very hard, dear Balder."</p>
               <p>"Now that I know there is no hope, I can acknowledge the good even while I feel
                  the hardship. Her dreams have been of a world such as no real existence<pb
                     n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6660-00000186"/> could show; to have been awakened would
                  permanently have saddened her, if no worse. But she is great enough to believe
                  without seeing; and in the deepest sense, her belief is true. She still remains in
                  that ideal fairy-land in which I found her; and no doubt, as time goes on, her
                  visions grow more beautiful!"</p>
               <p>Thus Balder Helwyse, in tones agreeably vigorous, though grave and low.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes; and perhaps, dear Balder, the denial of this one great boon may save her
                  from much indefinite disquiet; and certainly, as you say, from the great danger of
                  disappointment and its consequences. Yes,—and you may still keep her lamp alight,
                  with a more lasting than Promethean fire!— But how is it with you, dear boy?"</p>
               <p>"Let none who love me pray for my temporal prosperity," returns Helwyse, turning
                  his strong, dark gaze on the other's aged eyes. "I have met with many worshippers
                  of false gods, but none the germs of whose sin I found not in myself. The
                     <emph>I</emph> to whom was confided this excellent instrument of faculties and
                  senses is a poor, weak, selfish creature, who fancied his gifts argued the
                  possession of the very merits whose lack they prove. God, in His infinite mercy,
                  deals sternly with me; and I know how to thank Him!"—</p>
               <p>Mr. MacGentle does not reply in words; but a grave smile glimmers in his faded
                  eyes, and, smiling, he slowly shakes his venerable head.</p>
               <p>One more brief glimpse, and then we are done.—</p>
               <p>A pleasant parlor of southern aspect, looking through a deep bay-window over a
                  spacious garden. Here sits a stalwart gentleman of middle age, with a little boy
                  and girl on either knee, who play bo-peep with his wide-spreading yellow beard.
                  How they all laugh! and what a pleasant laugh has the stalwart, dark-eyed
                  gentleman,—so deep-toned and yet so boyish! But presently all three pause to take
                  breath.</p>
               <p>"Thor," then says the gentleman, "whose portrait did I tell you that was?" And he
                  points to an oil-painting hanging over the piano.</p>
               <p>"Grandpapa MacGentle, papa!"</p>
               <p>"What did he do for all of us?"</p>
               <p>As Master Thor hesitates a moment, the little golden-haired lady breaks
                     in,—"<emph>I</emph> know, papa! He made uth rich, and gave uth our houthe, and
                  he thaw me when I wath a wee, wee baby, and then he—he—"</p>
               <p>"He went to Heaven, papa!" says Thor, recovering himself.</p>
               <p>Hereupon there was a silence, because the two children, glancing up in their
                  father's face, saw that it was grave and thoughtful.</p>
               <p>But suddenly the little girl pricks up her small<pb n="372"
                     xml:id="VAC6660-00000187"/> ears, and scrambles to the carpet, and sets off for
                  the door at full speed, without a word. Thor is close behind, but just too late to
                  be first in opening the door.</p>
               <p>"Mamma! mamma!"</p>
               <p>And Balder Helwyse springs up, and as she enters with the rejoicing children at
                  each hand, he meets her with the thrilling smile which, in this world, she will
                  never see!</p>
