            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE style and finish of the following sketches may make it sufficiently obvious to
               the reader, without further statement, that they are written with no higher ambition
               than that of filling the ephemeral pages of a weekly paper. But their publication in
               that form, has been the means of giving them a popularity which their author trusts
               justifies him in reproducing them in a collected and more permanent shape. The
               "Condensed Novels," to which this more particularly refers, claim no other
               originality in their general conception, than that shown by their title—a humorous
                  <emph>condensation</emph> of the salient characteristics of certain writers,
               selected without reference to their standing or prominence in literature. In one or
               two instances the parody has been based upon some individual work—but in most cases
               the author has endeavored to show the general idiosyncrasies of each author.</p>
            <p>For the other sketches, though comprising the greater part of the volume, their
               introduction here must rest solely upon the assumed popularity of the "Condensed
               Novels." They were selected from writings, scattered through the California press
               during a period of five or six years. Though based upon local scenery and local
               subjects, no one is better aware than their author, of their deficiency in local
               coloring, a deficiency which he nevertheless believes is made up by such general
               interest and abstract fidelity, as may make them applicable to any locality.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                     <p>IT was toward the close of a bright October day. The last rays of the
                        setting sun were reflected from one of those sylvan lakes peculiar to the
                        Sierras of California. On the right the curling smoke of an Indian village
                        rose between the columns of the lofty pines, while to the left the log
                        cottage of Judge Tompkins, embowered in buckeyes, completed the enchanting
                        picture.</p>
                     <p>Although the exterior of the cottage was humble and unpretentious, and in
                        keeping with the wildness of the landscape, its interior gave evidence of
                        the cultivation and refinement of its inmates. An aquarium, containing
                        goldfishes, stood on a marble centre table at one end of the apartment,
                        while a magnificent grand piano occupied the other. The<pb n="12-13"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000007"/> floor was covered with a yielding tapestry
                        carpet, and the walls were adorned with paintings from the pencils of Van
                        Dyke, Rubens, Tintoretto, Michael Angelo, and the productions of the more
                        modern Turner, Kensett, Church and Bierstadt. Although Judge Tompkins had
                        chosen the frontiers of civilization as his home, it was impossible for him
                        to entirely forego the habits and tastes of his former life. He was seated
                        in a luxurious arm-chair, writing at a mahogany <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >écritoire,</foreign> while his daughter, a lovely young girl of
                        seventeen summers, plied her crochet needle on an ottoman beside him. A
                        bright fire of pine logs flickered and flamed on the ample hearth.</p>
                     <p>Genevra Octavia Tompkins was Judge Tompkins's only child. Her mother had
                        long since died on the Plains. Reared in affluence, no pains had been spared
                        with the daughter's education. She was a graduate of one of the principal
                        seminaries, and spoke French with a perfect Benicia accent. Peerlessly
                        beautiful, she was dressed in a white <foreign xml:lang="FRA">moire
                           antique</foreign> robe trimmed with <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >tulle.</foreign> That simple rosebud, with which most heroines
                        exclusively decorate their hair, was all she wore in her raven locks.</p>
                     <p>The Judge was the first to break the silence:</p>
                     <p>"Genevra, the logs which compose yonder fire seem to have been incautiously
                        chosen. The sibilation produced by the sap, which exudes copiously
                        therefrom, is not conducive to composition."</p>
                     <p>"True, father, but I thought it would be <choice>

                        </choice> to the constant crepitation which is apt to attend tend the
                        combustion of more seasoned ligneous fragments.</p>
                     <p>The Judge looked admiringly at the intellectual features of the graceful
                        girl, and half forgot the slight annoyances of the green wood in the musical
                        accents of his daughter. He was smoothing her hair tenderly, when the shadow
                        of a tall figure, which suddenly darkened the doorway, caused him to look
                        up.</p>

                     <p>IT needed but a glance at the new comer to detect at once the form and
                        features of the haughty aborigine—the untaught and untrammeled son of the
                        forest. Over one shoulder a blanket, negligently but gracefully thrown,
                        disclosed a bare and powerful breast, decorated with a quantity of three
                        cent postage stamps which he had despoiled from an Overland Mail stage a few
                        weeks previous. A cast-off beaver of Judge Tompkins's, adorned by a simple
                        feather, covered his erect head, from beneath which his straight locks
                        descended. His right hand hung lightly by his side, while his left was
                        engaged in holding on a pair of pantaloons, which the lawless grace and
                        freedom of his lower limbs evidently could not brook.</p>
                     <p>"Why," said the Indian, in a low sweet tone, "why does the Pale Face still
                        follow the track of the Red Man? Why does he pursue him, even as,<pb

                        repeated, quietly but firmly, abstracting a silver spoon from the table,
                        "why do you seek to drive him from the wigwams of his fathers? His brothers
                        are already gone to the happy hunting grounds. Will the Pale Face seek him
                        there?" And, averting his face from the Judge, he hastily slipped a silver
                        cake-basket beneath his blanket, to conceal his emotion.</p>
                     <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Muck-a-Muck has spoken," said Genevra softly. "Let him now
                        listen. Are the acorns of the mountain sweeter than the esculent and
                        nutritious bean of the Pale Face miner? Does my brother prize the edible
                        qualities of the snail above that of the crisp and oleaginous bacon?
                        Delicious are the grasshoppers that sport on the hillside—are they better
                        than the dried apples of the Pale Faces? Pleasant is the gurgle of the
                        torrent, <hi rend="i"/>Kish-Kish, but is it better than the cluck-cluck of
                        old Bourbon from the old stone bottle?"</p>
                     <p>"Ugh!" said the Indian, "Ugh! good. The White Rabbit is wise. Her words fall
                        as the snow on Tootoonolo, and the rocky heart of Muck-a-Muck is hidden.
                        What says my brother the Gray Gopher of Dutch Flat?'</p>
                     <p>"She has spoken, Muck-a-Muck," said the Judge, gazing fondly on his
                        daughter. It is well. Our treaty is concluded. No, thank you—you need
                           <emph>not</emph> dance the Dance of Snow Shoes, or the Moccasin Dance,
                        the Dance of Green Corn, or the Treaty Dance. I would be alone. A strange
                        sadness overpowers me."</p>
                     <p>"I go," said the Indian. "Tell your great chief in Washington, the Sachem
                        Andy, that the Red Man is retiring before the footsteps of the adventurous
                        Pioneer. Inform him, if you please, that westward the star of empire takes
                        its way, that the chiefs of the Pi-Ute nation are for Reconstruction to a
                        man, and that Klamath will poll a heavy Republican vote in the fall.</p>
                     <p>And folding his blanket more tightly around him, Muck-a Muck withdrew.</p>

                        retreating Overland Mail stage which conveyed her father to Virginia City.
                        "He may never return again," sighed the young girl as she glanced at the

                        with an accident! I mind me now a fearful legend, familiar to my childhood.

                        all passengers maimed by accident, to prevent tedious litigation? No, no.
                        But why this weight upon my heart?"</p>
                     <p>She seated herself at the piano and lightly passed<pb n="16-17"

                        mezzo-soprano voice, she sang the first verse of one of the most popular

                        sank listlessly to her side. Music could not chase away the mysterious
                        shadow from her heart. Again she rose. Putting on a white crape bonnet, and
                        carefully drawing a pair of lemon-colored gloves over her taper fingers, she
                        seized her parasol and plunged into the depths of the pine forest.</p>

                     <p>GENEVRA had not proceeded many miles before a weariness seized upon her
                        fragile limbs, and she would fain seat herself upon the trunk of a prostrate
                        pine, which she previously dusted with her handkerchief. The sun was just
                        sinking below the horizon, and the scene was one of gorgeous and sylvan
                        beauty. "How beautiful is Nature," murmured the innocent girl, as, reclining
                        gracefully against the root of the tree, she gathered up her skirts and tied
                        the handkerchief around her throat. But a low growl interrupted her
                        meditation. Starting to her feet, her eyes met a sight which froze her blood
                        with terror.</p>
                     <p>The only outlet to the forest was the narrow path, barely wide enough for a
                        single person, hemmed in by trees and rocks, which she had just traversed.
                        Down this path, in Indian file, came a monstrous grizzly, closely followed
                        by a California lion, a wild cat, and a buffalo, the rear being brought up
                        by a wild Spanish bull. The mouths of the three first animals were distended
                        with frightful significance; the horns of the last were lowered as
                        ominously. As Genevra was preparing to faint, she heard a low voice behind
                        her.</p>
                     <p>"Eternally dog-gone my skin ef this ain't the puttiest chance yet."</p>
                     <p>At the same moment, a long, shining barrel dropped lightly from behind her,
                        and rested over her shoulder.</p>
                     <p>Genevra shuddered.</p>
                     <p>"Dern ye—don't move!"</p>
                     <p>Genevra became motionless.</p>
                     <p>The crack of a rifle rang through the woods. Three frightful yells were
                        heard, and two sullen roars. Five animals bounded into the air and five
                        lifeless bodies lay upon the plain. The well-aimed bullet had done its work.
                        Entering the open throat of the grizzly, it had traversed his body, only to
                        enter the throat of the California lion, and in like manner the catamount,
                        until it passed through into the respective foreheads of the bull and the
                        buffalo, and finally fell flattened from the rocky hillside.</p>

                     <p>Genevra turned quickly. "My preserver!" she shrieked, and fell into the arms
                        of Natty Bumpo—the celebrated Pike Ranger of Donner Lake.</p>

                     <p>THE moon rose cheerfully above Donner Lake. On its placid bosom a dug-out
                        canoe glided rapidly, containing Natty Bumpo and Genevra Tompkins.</p>
                     <p>Both were silent. The same thought possessed each, and perhaps there was
                        sweet companionship even in the unbroken quiet. Genevra bit the handle of
                        her parasol and blushed. Natty Bumpo took a fresh chew of tobacco. At length
                        Genevra said, as if in half-spoken reverie:</p>
                     <p>"The soft shining of the moon and the peaceful ripple of the waves, seem to
                        say to us various things of an instructive and moral tendency."</p>
                     <p>"You may bet yer pile on that, Miss," said her companion gravely. "It's all
                        the preachin' and psalm-singin' I've heern since I was a boy."</p>
                     <p>"Noble being!" said Miss Tompkins to herself, glancing at the stately Pike
                        as he bent over his paddle to conceal his emotion. "Reared in this wild
                        seclusion, yet he has become penetrated with visible consciousness of a
                        Great First Cause." Then, collecting herself, she said aloud: "Methinks
                        'twere pleasant to glide ever thus down the stream of life, hand in hand
                        with the one being whom the soul claims as its affinity. But what am I
                        saying?"—and the delicate-minded girl hid her face in her hands.</p>
                     <p>A long silence ensued, which was at length broken by her companion.</p>
                     <p>"Ef you mean you're on the marry," he said, thoughtfully, I ain't in no wise
                        partikler!"</p>
                     <p>"My husband," faltered the blushing girl; and she fell into his arms.</p>
                     <p>In ten minutes more the loving couple had landed at Judge Tompkins's.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                     <p>A YEAR has passed away. Natty Bumpo was returning from Gold Hill, where he
                        had been to purchase provisions. On his way to Donner Lake, rumors of an
                        Indian uprising met his ears. "Dern their pesky skins, ef they dare to touch
                        my Jenny," he muttered between his clenched teeth.</p>
                     <p>It was dark when he reached the borders of the lake. Around a glittering
                        fire he dimly discerned dusky figures dancing. They were in war paint.
                        Conspicuous among them was the renowned Muck-a-Muck. But why did the fingers
                        of Natty Bumpo tighten convulsively around his rifle?</p>
                     <p>The chief held in his hand long tufts of raven hair. The heart of the
                        pioneer sickened as he recognized the clustering curls of Genevra. In a
                        moment his rifle was at his shoulder, and with a sharp "ping,"<pb n="20-21"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000011"/> Muck-a-Muck leaped into the air a corpse. To
                        dash out the brains of the remaining savages, tear the tresses from the
                        stiffening hand of Muck-a-Muck, and dash rapidly forward to the cottage of
                        Judge Tompkins, was the work a moment.</p>
                     <p>He burst open the door. Why did he stand transfixed with open mouth and
                        distended eye-balls? Was the sight too horrible to be borne? On the
                        contrary, before him, in her peerless beauty, stood Genevra Tompkins,
                        learning on her father's arm.</p>
                     <p>"Ye'r not scalped, then!" gasped her lover.</p>
                     <p>"No. I have no hesitation in saying that I am not; but why this abruptness?"
                        responded Genevra.</p>
                     <p>Bumpo could not speak, but frantically produced the silken tresses. Genevra
                        turned her face aside.</p>
                     <p>"Why, that's her waterfall," said the Judge.</p>
                     <p>Bumpo sank fainting to the floor.</p>
                     <p>The famous Pike chieftain never recovered from the deceit, and refused to
                        marry Genevra, who died, twenty years afterwards, of a broken heart. Judge
                        Tompkins lost his fortune in Wild Cat. The stage passes twice a week the
                        deserted cottage at Donner Lake. Thus was the death of Muck-a-Muck

                        on the western coast of Ireland. On a lofty crag, overlooking the hoarse
                        Atlantic, stands "Deuville's Shot Tower"—a corruption by the peasantry of
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">D'Eauville's Château,</foreign> so called from my
                        great grandfather, Phelim St. Remy D'Euville, who assumed the name and title
                        of a French heiress with whom he ran away. To this fact my familiar
                        knowledge and excellent pronunciation of the French language may be
                        attributed, as well as many of the events which covered my after life.</p>
                     <p>The Deuvilles were always passionately fond of field sports. At the age of
                        four, I was already the boldest rider and the best shot in the country. When
                        only eight, I won the St. Remy Cup at the Pilwiddle races—riding my favorite
                        bloodmare <hi rend="i"/>Hell-<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6642-00000012"/>
                        <hi rend="i"/>fire. As I approached the stand amidst the plaudits of the
                        assembled multitude, and cries of "Thrue for ye, Masther Terence," and "Oh,
                        but it's a Diuville!" there was a slight stir among the gentry, who
                        surrounded the Lord Lieutenant, and other titled personages whom the race
                        had attracted thither. "How young he is—a mere child; and yet how noble
                        looking," said a sweet, low voice, which thrilled my soul.</p>
                     <p>I looked up and met the full liquid orbs of the Hon. Blanche Fitzroy
                        Sackville, youngest daughter of the Lord Lieutenant. She blushed deeply. I
                        turned pale and almost fainted. But the cold, sneering tones of a masculine
                        voice sent the blood back again into my youthful cheek.</p>
                     <p>"Very likely the ragged scion of one of these banditti Irish gentry, who has
                        taken naturally to 'the road.' He should be at school—though I warrant me
                        his knowledge of Terence will not extend beyond his own name," said Lord
                        Henry Somerset, aid-decamp to the Lord Lieutenant.</p>
                     <p>A moment and I was perfectly calm, though cold as ice. Dismounting, and
                        stepping to the side of the speaker, I said in a low, firm voice:</p>
                     <p>"Had your Lordship read Terence more carefully, you would have learned that
                        banditti are sometimes proficient in other arts beside horsemanship," and I
                        touched his holster significantly with my hand. I had not read Terence
                        myself, but with the skillful audacity of my race I calculated that a vague
                        allusion, coupled with a threat, would embarrass him. It did.</p>
                     <p>"Ah—what mean you?" he said, white with rage.</p>
                     <p>"Enough, we are observed," I replied; "Father Tom will wait on you this
                        evening: and to-morrow morning, my lord, in the glen below Pilwiddle we will
                        meet again."</p>
                     <p>"Father Tom—glen!" ejaculated the Englishman, with genuine surprise. "What?
                        do priests carry challenges and act as seconds in your infernal
                        country?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes!" I answered scornfully, "why should they not? Their services are more
                        often necessary than those of a surgeon," I added significantly, turning
                        away.</p>
                     <p>The party slowly rode off, with the exception of the Hon. Blanche Sackville,
                        who lingered for a moment behind. In an instant I was at her side. Bending
                        her blushing face over the neck of her white filly, she said hurriedly:</p>
                     <p>"Words have passed between Lord Somerset and yourself. You are about to
                        fight. Don't deny it—but hear me. You will meet him—I know your skill of
                        weapons. He will be at your mercy. I entreat you to spare his life!"</p>
                     <p>I hesitated. "Never!" I cried passionately; "he has insulted a
                        Deuville!"</p>
                     <p>"Terence," she whispered, "Terence—<emph>for my sake?"</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>The blood rushed to my cheeks at the loving epithets, and her eyes sought
                        the ground in bashful confusion.</p>
                     <p>"You love him then?" I cried, bitterly.</p>
                     <pb n="24" xml:id="VAC6642-00000013"/>
                     <p>"No, no," she said, agitatedly, "no, you do me wrong. I—I—cannot explain
                        myself. My father!—the Lady Dowager Sackville—the estate of Sackville—the
                        borough—my uncle, Fitzroy Somerset. Ah! what am I saying? Forgive me. Oh,
                        Terence," she said, as her beautiful head sank on my shoulder, "you know not
                        what I suffer!"</p>
                     <p>I seized her hand and covered it with passionate kisses. But the high-bred
                        English girl, recovering something of her former <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >hauteur,</foreign> said hastily, "Leave me, leave me, but promise!"</p>
                     <p>"I promise," I replied, enthusiastically: "I <emph>will</emph> spare his
                        life!"</p>
                     <p>"Thanks, Terence—thanks!" and disengaging her hand from my lips she rode
                        rapidly away.</p>
                     <p>The next morning, the Hon. Capt. Henry Somerset and myself exchanged
                        nineteen shots in the glen, and at each fire I shot away a button from his
                        uniform. As my last bullet shot off the last button from his sleeve, I
                        remarked quietly, "You seem now, my lord, to be almost as ragged as the
                        gentry you sneered at," and rode haughtily away.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I was nineteen years old my father sold the <foreign xml:lang="FRA"

                        joined, "you'll represent the estate in the Army, if you won't in the
                        House." Poor fellow, he paid for his meaningless joke with his life, for I
                        shot him through the heart the next morning. You're a good fellow,
                        Deuville," said the poor boy faintly, as I knelt beside him: "good bye!" For
                        the first time since my grandfather's death I wept. I could not help
                        thinking that I would have been a better man if Blanche—but why proceed? Was
                        she not now in Florence—the belle of the English Embassy.</p>
                     <p>But Napoleon had returned from Elba. Europe was in a blaze of excitement.
                        The Allies were preparing to resist the Man of Destiny. We were ordered from
                        Gibraltar home, and were soon again <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en
                           route</foreign> for Brussels. I did not regret that I was to be placed in
                        active service. I was ambitious, and longed for an opportunity to
                        distinguish myself. My garrison life in Gibraltar had been monotonous and
                        dull. I had killed five men in duel, and had an affair with the colonel of
                        my regiment, who handsomely apologized before the matter assumed a serious
                        aspect. I had been twice in love. Yet these were but boyish freaks and
                        follies. I wished to be a man.</p>
                     <p>The time soon came—the morning of Waterloo. But why describe that momentous
                        battle, on which the fate of the entire world was hanging? Twice were the
                        Fifty-sixth surrounded by French cuirassiers, and twice did we mow them down
                        by our fire.<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6642-00000015"/> I had seven horses
                        shot under me, and was mounting the eighth, when an orderly rode up hastily,
                        touched his cap, and handing me a despatch, galloped rapidly away.</p>
                     <p>I opened it hurriedly and read:</p>
                     <p>"LET PICTON ADVANCE IMMEDIATELY ON THE RIGHT."</p>
                     <p>I saw it all at a glance. I had been mistaken for a general officer. But
                        what was to be done? Picton's division was two miles away, only accessible
                        through a heavy cross fire of artillery and musketry. But my mind was made
                        up.</p>
                     <p>In an instant I was engaged with an entire squadron of cavalry, who
                        endeavored to surround me. Cutting my way through them, I advanced boldly
                        upon a battery and sabred the gunners before they could bring their pieces
                        to bear. Looking around, I saw that I had in fact penetrated the French
                        centre. Before I was well aware of the locality, I was hailed by a sharp
                        voice in French:</p>
                     <p>"Come here, sir!"</p>
                     <p>I obeyed, and advanced to the side of a little man in a cocked hat.</p>
                     <p>"Has Grouchy come?"</p>
                     <p>"Not yet, sire," I replied—for it was the Emperor.</p>
                     <p>"Ha!" he said suddenly, bending his piercing eyes on my uniform; "a
                        prisoner?"</p>
                     <p>"No, sire," I said, proudly.</p>
                     <p>"A spy?"</p>
                     <p>I placed my hand upon my sword, but a gesture from the Emperor bade me
                        forbear.</p>
                     <p>"You are a brave man," he said.</p>
                     <p>I took my snuff-box from my pocket, and taking a pinch, replied by handing
                        it, with a bow, to the Emperor.</p>
                     <p>His quick eye caught the cipher on the lid.</p>
                     <p>"What! a D'Euville? Ha! this accounts for the purity of your accent. Any
                        relation to Roderick d'Euville.</p>
                     <p>"My father, sire."</p>
                     <p>"He was my schoolfellow at the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Ecole
                           Politechnique.</foreign> Embrace me!" and the Emperor fell upon my neck
                        in the presence of his entire staff. Then recovering himself, he gently
                        placed in my hand his own magnificent snuff-box, in exchange for mine, and
                        hanging upon my breast the cross of the Legion of Honor which he took from
                        his own, he bade one of his Marshals conduct me back to my regiment.</p>
                     <p>I was so intoxicated with the honor of which I had been the recipient, that
                        on reaching our lines I uttered a shout of joy and put spurs to my horse.
                        The intelligent animal seemed to sympathize with my feelings, and fairly
                        flew over the ground. On a rising eminence a few yards before me stood a
                        gray-haired officer, surrounded by his staff. I don't know what possessed
                        me, but putting spurs to my horse, I rode at him boldly, and with one bound
                        cleared him, horse and all. A shout of indignation arose from the assembled
                        staff. I wheeled suddenly, with the intention of apologizing, but my mare
                        misunderstood me, and again dashing forward, once more vaulted over the head
                        of the officer, this time unfortunately<pb n="28-29"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000016"/> tunately uncovering him by a vicious kick of
                        her hoof. "Seize him!" roared the entire army. I was seized. As the soldiers
                        led me away, I asked the name of the gray-haired officer. "That—why that's
                        the DUKE OF WELLINGTON!"</p>
                     <p>I fainted.</p>

                     <p>For six months I had brain fever. During my illness the grapeshot were
                        extracted from my body which I had unconsciously received during the battle.
                        When I opened my eyes I met the sweet glance of a Sister of Charity.</p>
                     <p>"Blanche!" I stammered feebly.</p>
                     <p>"The same," she replied.</p>
                     <p>"You here?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, dear; but hush! It's a long story. You see, dear Terence, your

                     <p>"Of course not," said Blanche, with her old sweet smile; "you've had brain
                        fever; so go to sleep."</p>

                     <p>THE sun was setting over Sloperton Grange, and reddened the window of the
                        lonely chamber in the western tower, supposed to be haunted by Sir Edward
                        Sedilia, the founder of the Grange. In the dreamy distance arose the gilded
                        mausoleum of Lady Felicia Sedilia, who haunted that portion of Sedilia
                        Manor, know as "Stiff-uns Acre." A little to the left of the Grange might
                        have been seen a mouldering ruin, known as "Guy's Keep," haunted by the
                        spirit of Sir Guy Sedilia, who was found, one morning, crushed by one of the
                        fallen battlements. Yet, as the setting sun gilded these objects, a
                        beautiful and almost holy calm seemed diffused about the Grange.</p>
                     <p>The Lady Selina sat by an oriel window, overlooking the park. The sun sank
                        gently in the bosom of the German Ocean, and yet the lady did<pb n="30-31"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000017"/> not lift her beautiful head from the finely
                        curved arm and diminutive hand which supported it. When darkness finally
                        shrouded the landscape, she started, for the sound of horse-hoofs clattered
                        over the stones of the avenue. She had scarcely risen before an aristocratic
                        young man fell on his knees before her.</p>
                     <p>"My Selina!"</p>
                     <p>"Edgardo! You here?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, dearest."</p>
                     <p>"And—you—you—have—seen nothing?" said the lady in an agitated voice and
                        nervous manner, turning her face aside to conceal her emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing—that is nothing of any account," said Edgardo. "I passed the ghost
                        of your aunt in the park, noticed the spectre of your uncle in the ruined
                        keep, and observed the familiar features of the spirit of your
                        great-grandfather at his post. But nothing beyond these trifles, my Selina.
                        Nothing more, love, absolutely nothing."</p>
                     <p>The young man turned his dark liquid orbs fondly upon the ingenuous face of
                        his betrothed.</p>
                     <p>"My own Edgardo!—and you still love me? You still would marry me in spite of
                        this dark mystery which surrounds me? In spite of the fatal history of my
                        race? In spite of the ominous predictions of my aged nurse?"</p>
                     <p>"I would, Selina;" and the young man passed his arm around her yielding
                        waist. The two lovers gazed at each other's faces in unspeakable bliss.
                        Suddenly Selina started.</p>
                     <p>"Leave me, Edgardo! leave me! A mysterious something—a fatal misgiving—a
                        dark ambiguity—an equivocal mistrust oppresses me. I would be alone!"</p>
                     <p>The young man arose, and cast a loving glance on the lady. "Then we will be
                        married on the seventeenth."</p>
                     <p>"The seventeenth," repeated Selina, with a mysterious shudder.</p>
                     <p>They embraced and parted. As the clatter of hoofs in the court-yard died
                        away, the Lady Selina sank into the chair she had just quitted.</p>
                     <p>"The seventeenth," she repeated slowly, with the same fatal shudder.
                        "Ah!—what if he should know that I have another husband living? Dare I
                        reveal to him that I have two legitimate and three natural children? Dare I
                        repeat to him the history of my youth? Dare I confess that at the age of
                        seven I poisoned my sister, by putting verdigris in her cream-tarts—that I
                        threw my cousin from a swing at the age of twelve? That the lady's maid who
                        incurred the displeasure of my girlhood now lies at the bottom of the
                        horse-pond? No! no! he is too pure—too good—too innocent, to hear such
                        improper conversation!" and her whole body writhed as she rocked to and fro
                        in a paroxysm of grief.</p>
                     <p>But she was soon calm. Rising to her feet, she opened a secret panel in the
                        wall, and revealed a slow-match ready for lighting.</p>
                     <p>"This match," said the Lady Selina, "is connected with a mine beneath the
                        western tower, where my three children are confined; another branch of it<pb
                           n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6642-00000018"/> lies under the parish church, where
                        the record of my first marriage is kept. I have only to light this match and
                        the whole of my past life is swept away!" She approached the match with a
                        lighted candle.</p>
                     <p>But a hand was laid upon her arm, and with a shriek the Lady Selina fell on
                        her knees before the spectre of Sir Guy.</p>

                     <p>"FORBEAR, Selina, said the phantom in a hollow voice.</p>
                     <p>"Why should I forbear?" responded Selina haughtily, as she recovered her
                        courage. "You know the secret of our race?"</p>
                     <p>"I do. Understand me—I do not object to the eccentricities of your youth. I
                        know the fearful fate which, pursuing you, led you to poison your sister and
                        drown your lady's maid. I know the awful doom which I have brought upon this
                        house! But if you make way with these children——"</p>
                     <p>"Well," said the Lady Selina, hastily.</p>
                     <p>"They will haunt you!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, I fear them not," said Selina, drawing her superb figure to its full
                        height.</p>
                     <p>"But what place are they to haunt? The ruin is sacred to your uncle's
                        spirit. Your aunt monopolizes the park, and, I must be allowed to state, not
                        unfrequently trespasses upon the grounds of others. The horsepond is
                        requented by the spirit of your maid, and your murdered sister walks these
                        corridors dors. To be plain, there is no room at Sloperton Grange for
                        another ghost. I cannot have them in my room—for you know I don't like
                        children. Think of this, rash girl, and forbear! Would you, Selina," said
                        the phantom mournfully, "would you force your great-grandfather's spirit to
                        take lodgings elsewhere?"</p>
                     <p>Lady Selina's hand trembled; the lighted candle fell from her nerveless
                        fingers.</p>
                     <p>"No," she cried passionately; "Never!" and fell fainting to the floor.</p>

                     <p>EDGARDO galloped rapidly towards Sloperton. When the outline of the Grange
                        had faded away in the darkness, he reined his magnificent steed beside the
                        ruins of Guy's Keep.</p>
                     <p>"It wants but a few minutes of the hour," he said, consulting his watch by
                        the light of the moon. "He dare not break his word. He will come." He
                        paused, and peered anxiously into the darkness. "But come what may, she is
                        mine," he continued, as his thoughts reverted fondly to the fair lady he had
                        quitted. "Yet, if she knew all. If she knew that I were a disgraced and
                        ruined man—a felon and an outcast. If she knew that at the age of fourteen I
                        murdered my Latin tutor and forged my uncle's will. If she knew that I had
                        three wives already, and that the fourth victim of misplaced confidence<pb

                     <p>"Ha! here he is! Well?"</p>
                     <p>These words were addressed to a ruffian in a slouched hat, who suddenly
                        appeared from Guy's Keep.</p>
                     <p>"I be's here, measter," said the villain, with a disgracefully low accent
                        and complete disregard of grammatical rules.</p>
                     <p>"It is well. Listen: I'm in possession of facts that will send you to the
                        gallows. I know of the murder of Bill Smithers, the robbery of the toll-gate
                        keeper, and the making away of the youngest daughter of Sir Reginald de
                        Walton. A word from me, and the officers of justice are on your track."</p>
                     <p>Burke the Slogger trembled.</p>

                     <p>The villain's eyes sparkled as he nodded at Edgardo.</p>

                     <p>ABOUT half a mile from Sloperton Station the South Clapham and Medway line
                        crossed a bridge over Sloperton-on-Trent. As the shades of evening were
                        closing, a man in a slouched hat might have been seen carrying a saw and axe
                        under his arm, hanging about the bridge. From time to time he disappeared in
                        the shadow of its abutments, but the sound of a saw and axe still betrayed
                        his vicinity. At exactly nine o'clock he re-appeared, and crossing to the
                        Sloperton side, rested his shoulder against the abutment and gave a shove.
                        The bridge swayed a moment, and then fell with a splash into the water,
                        leaving a space of one hundred feet between the two banks. This done, Burke
                        the Slogger—for it was he—with a fiendish chuckle seated himself on the
                        divided railway track and awaited the coming of the train.</p>
                     <p>A shriek from the woods announced its approach. For an instant Burke the
                        Slogger saw the glaring of a red lamp. The ground trembled. The train was
                        going with fearful rapidity. Another second and it had reached the bank.
                        Burke the Slogger uttered a fiendish laugh. But the next moment the train
                        leaped across the chasm, striking the rails exactly even, and, dashing out
                        the life of Burke the Slogger, sped away to Sloperton.</p>
                     <p>The first object that greeted Edgardo as he rode up to the station on the
                        arrival of the train, was the body of Burke the Slogger hanging on the
                        cow-catcher; the second was the face of his deserted wife looking from the
                        windows of a second-class carriage.</p>

                     <p>A NAMELESS terror seemed to have taken possession of Clarissa, Lady Selina's
                        maid, as she rushed into the presence of her mistress.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, my lady, such news!"</p>
                     <p>"Explain yourself," said her mistress, rising.</p>
                     <p>"An accident has happened on the railway, and a man has been killed."</p>
                     <p>"What—not Edgardo!" almost screamed Selina.</p>

                     <p>"My first husband!" said Lady Selina, sinking on her knees. "Just heaven, I

                     <p>THE morning of the seventeenth dawned brightly over Sloperton. "A fine day
                        for the wedding," said the sexton to Swipes, the butler of Sloperton Grange.
                        The aged retainer shook his head sadly. "Alas! there's no trusting in
                        signs!" he continued. "Seventy-five years ago, on a day like this, my young
                        mistress—" but he was cut short by the appearance of a stranger.</p>
                     <p>"I would see Sir Edgardo," said the new-comer, impatiently.</p>
                     <p>The bridegroom, who, with the rest of the wedding-train, was about stepping
                        into the carriage to proceed to the parish church, drew the stranger
                        aside.</p>
                     <p>"It's done!" said the stranger, in a hoarse whisper.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! and you buried her?"</p>
                     <p>"With the others!"</p>
                     <p>"Enough. No more at present. Meet me after the ceremony, and you shall have
                        your reward.</p>
                     <p>The stranger shuffled away, and Edgardo returned to his bride. "A trifling
                        matter of business I had forgotten, my dear Selina; let us proceed," and the
                        young man pressed the timid hand of his blushing bride as he handed her into
                        the carriage. The cavalcade rode out of the courtyard. At the same moment,
                        the deep bell on Guy's Keep tolled ominously.</p>

                     <p>SCARCELY had the wedding-train left the Grange, than Alice Sedilia, youngest
                        daughter of Lady Selina, made her escape from the western tower, owing to a
                        lack of watchfulness on the part of Clarissa. The innocent Child, freed from
                        restraint, rambled through the lonely corridors, and finally, opening a
                        door, found herself in her mother's boudoir. For some time she amused
                        herself by examining the various ornaments and elegant trifles with which it
                        was filled. Then, in pursuance of a childish freak, she dressed herself in
                        her mother's laces and ribbons. In this occupation she chanced to touch a
                        peg which proved to be a spring that opened a secret panel in the wall.

                        slow-match of a fire-work. Taking a lucifer match in her hand she approached
                        the fuse. She hesitated a moment. What would her mother and her nurse
                        say?</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the ringing of the chimes of Sloperton parish church met her ear.
                        Alice knew that the sound signified that the marriage party had entered the
                        church, and that she was secure from interruption. With a childish smile
                        upon her lips, Alice Sedilia touched off the slow-match.</p>

                     <p>AT exactly two o'clock on the seventeenth, Rupert Sedilia, who had just
                        returned from India, was thoughtfully descending the hill toward Sloperton
                        manor. "If I can prove that my aunt Lady Selina was married before my father
                        died, I can establish my claim to Sloperton Grange," he uttered, half aloud.
                        He paused, for a sudden trembling of the earth beneath his feet, and a
                        terrific explosion, as of a park of artillery, arrested his progress. At the
                        same moment he beheld a dense cloud of smoke envelope the churchyard of
                        Sloperton, and the western tower of the Grange seemed to be lifted bodily
                        from its foundation. The air seemed filled with falling fragments, and two
                        dark objects struck the earth close at his feet. Rupert picked them up. One
                        seemed to be a heavy volume bound in brass.</p>
                     <p>A cry burst from his lips.</p>
                     <p>"The Parish Records." He opened the volume hastily. It contained the
                        marriage of Lady Selina to "Burke the Slogger."</p>
                     <p>The second object proved to be a piece of parchment. He tore it open with
                        trembling fingers. It was the missing will of Sir James Sedilia!</p>

                     <head type="sub">SHOWING THE QUALITY OF THE CUSTOMERS OF THE INNKEEPER OF
                        PROVINS.</head>
                     <p>TWENTY years after, the gigantic innkeeper of Provins stood looking at a
                        cloud of dust on the highway.</p>
                     <p>This cloud of dust betokened the approach of a traveler. Travelers had been
                        rare that season on the highway between Paris and Provins.</p>
                     <p>The heart of the innkeeper rejoiced. Turning to Dame Perigord, his wife, he
                        said, stroking his white apron:</p>
                     <p>St. Denis! make haste and spread the cloth. Add a bottle of Charlevoix to
                        the table. This traveler, who rides so fast, by his pace must be a
                        Monseigneur.</p>
                     <p>Truly the traveler, clad in the uniform of a musketeer, as he drew up to the
                        door of the hostelry, did not seem to have spared his horse. Throwing his
                        reins to the landlord, he leaped lightly to the ground. He was a young man
                        of four and twenty, and spoke with a slight Gascon accent.</p>
                     <p>"I am hungry, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Morbleu!</foreign> I wish to
                        dine!"</p>
                     <p>The gigantic innkeeper bowed and led the way to a neat apartment, where a
                        table stood covered with tempting viands. The musketeer at once set to work.
                        Fowls, fish and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pâtés</foreign> disappeared before
                        him. Perigord sighed as she witnessed the devastations. Only once the
                        stranger paused.</p>
                     <p>"Wine!" Perigord brought wine. The stranger drank a dozen bottles. Finally
                        he rose to depart. Turning to the expectant landlord, he said:</p>
                     <p>"Charge it."</p>
                     <p>"To whom, your highness?" said Perigord, anxiously.</p>
                     <p>"To his Eminence!"</p>
                     <p>"Mazarin!" ejaculated the innkeeper.</p>
                     <p>"The same. Bring me my horse," and the musketeer, remounting his favorite
                        animal, rode away.</p>
                     <p>The innkeeper slowly turned back into the inn. Scarcely had he reached the
                        courtyard, before the clatter of hoofs again called him to the doorway. A
                        young musketeer of a light and graceful figure, rode up.</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Parbleu,</foreign> my dear Perigord, I am
                        famishing. What have you got for dinner?"</p>
                     <p>"Venison, capons, larks and pigeons, your excellency," replied the
                        obsequious landlord, bowing to the ground.</p>
                     <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6642-00000023"/>
                     <p>"Enough!" The young musketeer dismounted and entered the inn. Seating
                        himself at the table replenished by the careful Perigord, he speedily swept
                        it as clean as the first comer.</p>
                     <p>"Some wine, my brave Perigord," said the graceful young musketeer, as soon
                        as he could find utterance.</p>
                     <p>Perigord brought three dozen of Charlevoix. The young man emptied them
                        almost at a draught.</p>
                     <p>"By-by, Perigord," he said lightly, waving his hand, as, preceding the
                        astonished landlord, he slowly withdrew.</p>
                     <p>"But, your highness—the bill," said the astounded Perigord.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, the bill. Charge it!"</p>
                     <p>"To whom?"</p>
                     <p>"The Queen!"</p>
                     <p>"What, Madame?"</p>
                     <p>"The same. Adieu my good Perigord," and the graceful stranger rode away. An
                        interval of quiet succeeded, in which the innkeeper gazed woefully at his
                        wife. Suddenly he was startled by a clatter of hoofs, and an aristocratic
                        figure stood in the doorway.</p>
                     <p>"Ah," said the courtier good naturedly. "What, do my eyes deceive me? No, it
                        is the festive and luxurious Perigord. Perigord, listen. I famish. I
                        languish. I would dine."</p>
                     <p>The innkeeper again covered the table with viands. Again it was swept clean
                        as the fields of Egypt before the miraculous swarm of locusts. The stranger
                        looked up.</p>
                     <p>"Bring me another fowl, my Perigord."</p>
                     <p>"Impossible, your excellency, the larder is stripped clean."</p>
                     <p>"Another flitch of bacon, then."</p>
                     <p>"Impossible, your highness—there is no more."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then, wine!"</p>
                     <p>The landlord brought one hundred and forty-four bottles. The courtier drank
                        them all.</p>
                     <p>"One may drink if one cannot eat," said the aristocratic stranger,
                        good-humoredly.</p>
                     <p>The innkeeper shuddered.</p>
                     <p>The guest rose to depart. The innkeeper came slowly forward with his bill,
                        to which he had covertly added the losses which he had suffered from the
                        previous strangers.</p>
                     <p>"Ah! the bill—charge it."</p>
                     <p>"Charge it! to whom?"</p>
                     <p>"To the King," said the guest.</p>
                     <p>"What! his Majesty?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly. Farewell, Perigord."</p>
                     <p>The innkeeper groaned. Then he went out and took down his sign. Then
                        remarked to his wife:</p>
                     <p>"I am a plain man, and don't understand politics. It seems, however, that
                        the country is in a troubled state. Between his Eminence the Cardinal, his
                        Majesty the King, and her Majesty the Queen, I am a ruined man."</p>
                     <p>"Stay," said Dame Perigord, "I have an idea."</p>
                     <p>"And that is——"</p>
                     <p>"Become yourself a musketeer."</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE COMBAT.</head>
                     <p>ON leaving Provins the first musketeer proceeded to Nangis, where he was
                        reinforced by thirty-three followers. The second musketeer, arriving at
                        Nangis at the same moment, placed himself at the head of thirty-three more.
                        The third guest of the Landlord of Provins arrived at Nangis in time to
                        assemble together thirty-three other musketeers.</p>
                     <p>The first stranger led the troops of his Eminence.</p>
                     <p>The second led the troops of the Queen.</p>
                     <p>The third led the troops of the King.</p>
                     <p>The fight commenced. It raged terribly for seven hours. The first musketeer
                        killed thirty of the Queen's troops. The second musketeer killed thirty of
                        the King's troops. The third musketeer killed thirty of his Eminence's
                        troops.</p>
                     <p>By this time it will be perceived the number of musketeers had been narrowed
                        down to four on each side.</p>
                     <p>Naturally the three principal warriors approached each other.</p>
                     <p>They simultaneously uttered a cry:</p>
                     <p>"Aramis!"</p>
                     <p>"Athos!"</p>
                     <p>"D'Artagnan!"</p>
                     <p>They fell into each other's arms.</p>
                     <p>"And it seems that we are fighting against each other, my children," said
                        the Count de la Fere, mournfully.</p>
                     <p>"How singular!" exclaimed Aramis and D'Artagnan.</p>
                     <p>"Let us stop this fratricidal warfare," said Athos.</p>
                     <p>"We will!" they exclaimed together.</p>
                     <p>"But how to disband our followers?" queried D'Artagnan.</p>
                     <p>Aramis winked. They understood each other. "Let us cut 'em down!"</p>
                     <p>They cut 'em down. Aramis killed three. D'Artagnan three. Athos three.</p>
                     <p>The friends again embraced. "How like old times," said Aramis. "How
                        touching!" exclaimed the serious and philosophic Count de la Fere.</p>
                     <p>The galloping of hoofs caused them to withdraw from each other's embraces. A
                        gigantic figure rapidly approached.</p>
                     <p>"The innkeeper of Provins! they cried, drawing their swords.</p>
                     <p>"Perigord, down with him!" shouted D'Artagnan.</p>
                     <p>"Stay," said Athos.</p>
                     <p>The gigantic figure was beside them. He uttered a cry.</p>
                     <p>"Athos, Aramis, D'Artagnan!"</p>
                     <p>"Porthos!" exclaimed the astonished trio.</p>
                     <p>"The same." They all fell in each other's arms.</p>
                     <p>The Count de la Fere slowly raised his hands to Heaven. "Bless you! Bless
                        us, my children! However different our opinion may be in regard to politics,
                        we have but one opinions in regard to our<pb n="46-47"

                     <p>"Than Porthos?" said Aramis.</p>
                     <p>"Than D'Artagnan?" said Porthos.</p>
                     <p>"Than Athos?" said D'Artagnan.</p>

                     <head type="sub">SHOWING HOW THE KING OF FRANCE WENT UP A LADDER.</head>
                     <p>THE King descended into the garden. Proceeding cautiously along the terraced
                        walk, he came to the wall immediately below the windows of Madame. To the
                        left were two windows, concealed by vines. They opened into the apartments
                        of La Valliere.</p>
                     <p>The King sighed.</p>
                     <p>"It is about nineteen feet to that window," said the King. "If I had a
                        ladder about nineteen feet long, it would reach to that window. This is
                        logic."</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the King stumbled over something. "St. Denis!" he exclaimed,
                        looking down. It was a ladder, just nineteen feet long.</p>
                     <p>The King placed it against the wall. In so doing, he fixed the lower end
                        upon the abdomen of a man who lay concealed by the wall. The man did not
                        utter a cry or wince. The King suspected nothing. He ascended the
                        ladder.</p>
                     <p>The ladder was too short. Louis the Grand was not a tall man. He was still
                        two feet below the window.</p>
                     <p>"Dear me!" said the King.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the ladder was lifted two feet from below. This enabled the King to
                        leap in the window. At the further end of the apartment stood a young girl,
                        with red hair and a lame leg. She was trembling with emotion.</p>
                     <p>"Louise!"</p>
                     <p>"The King!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, my God, mademoiselle."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, my God, sire."</p>
                     <p>But a low knock at the door interrupted the lovers. The King uttered a cry
                        of rage; Louise one of despair.</p>
                     <p>The door opened and D'Artagnan entered.</p>
                     <p>"Good evening, sire," said the musketeer.</p>
                     <p>The King touched a bell. Porthos appeared in the doorway.</p>
                     <p>"Good evening, sire."</p>
                     <p>"Arrest M. D'Artagnan."</p>
                     <p>Porthos looked at D'Artagnan, and did not move.</p>
                     <p>The King almost turned purple with rage. He again touched the bell. Athos
                        entered.</p>
                     <p>"Count, arrest Porthos and D'Artagnan."</p>
                     <p>The Count de la Fere glanced at Porthos and D'Artagnan, and smiled
                        sweetly.</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Sacre!</foreign> Where is Aramis?" said the King,
                        violently.</p>
                     <p>"Here sire," and Aramis entered.</p>
                     <p>"Arrest Athos, Porthos and D'Artagnan.</p>
                     <p>Aramis bowed and folded his arms.</p>
                     <p>"Arrest yourself!"</p>
                     <pb n="48" xml:id="VAC6642-00000026"/>
                     <p>Aramis did not move.</p>
                     <p>The King shuddered and turned pale. "Am I not King of France?"</p>
                     <p>"Assuredly sire, but we are also severally, Porthos, Aramis, D'Artagnan, and
                        Athos."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" said the King.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sire."</p>
                     <p>"What does this mean?"</p>
                     <p>"It means, your majesty," said Aramis, stepping forward, "that your conduct
                        as a married man is highly improper. I am an Abbé, and I object to these
                        improprieties. My friends here, D'Artagnan, Athos and Porthos, pure-minded
                        young men, are also terribly shocked. Observe sire, how they blush!"</p>
                     <p>Athos, Porthos and D'Artagnan blushed.</p>
                     <p>"Ah," said the King, thoughtfully. "You teach me a lesson. You are devoted
                        and noble young gentlemen, but your only weakness is your excessive modesty.
                        From this moment I make you all Marshals and Dukes, with the exception of
                        Aramis.</p>
                     <p>"And me, sire?" said Aramis.</p>
                     <p>"You shall be an Archbishop!"</p>
                     <p>The four friends looked up and then rushed into each other's arms. The King
                        embraced Louise de la Valliere, by way of keeping them company. A pause
                        ensued. At last Athos spoke:</p>
                     <p>"Swear, my children, that next to yourselves, you will respect—the King of
                        France; and remember that 'Forty years after' we will meet again."</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE PROMPTINGS OF THE IDEAL.</head>
                     <p>IT was noon. Sir Edward had stepped from his brougham and was proceeding on
                        foot down the Strand. He was dressed with his usual faultless taste, but in
                        alighting from his vehicle his foot had slipped, and a small round disk of
                        conglomerated soil, which instantly appeared on his high arched instep,
                        marred the harmonious glitter of his boots. Sir Edward was fastidious.
                        Casting his eyes around, at a little distance he perceived the stand of a
                        youthful bootblack. Thither he sauntered, and carelessly placing his foot on
                        the low stool, he waited the application of the polisher's Art. "'Tis true,"
                        said Sir Edward to himself, yet half aloud, "the contact of the Foul and the
                        Disgusting mars the general effect of the Shiny and the Beautiful—and, yet,
                        why am I here? I repeat it, calmly and deliberately—why am I here? Ha!
                        Boy!"</p>
                     <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6642-00000028"/>
                     <p>The Boy looked up—his dark Italian eyes glanced intelligently at the
                        Philosopher, and, as with one hand he tossed back his glossy curls from his
                        marble brow, and with the other he spread the equally glossy Day &amp;
                        Martin over the Baronet's boot, he answered in deep rich tones: "The Ideal
                        is subjective to the Real. The exercise of apperception gives a
                        distinctiveness to idiocracy, which is, however, subject to the limits of
                        ME. You are an admirer of the Beautiful, sir. You wish your boots blacked.
                        The Beautiful is attainable by means of the Coin."</p>
                     <p>"Ah," said Sir Edward thoughtfully, gazing upon the almost supernal beauty
                        of the Child before him; "you speak well. You have read
                        <title>Kant.</title>"</p>
                     <p>The Boy blushed deeply. He drew a copy of <title>Kant</title> from his
                        blouse, but in his confusion several other volumes dropped from his bosom on
                        the ground. The Baronet picked them up.</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" said the Philosopher, "what's this? <title>Cicero's De
                           Senectute,</title> at your age, too? <title>Martial's Epigrams,</title>
                        <title>Cæsar's Commentaries.</title> What! a classical scholar?"</p>
                     <p>"E pluribus Unum. Nux vomica. Nil desperandum. Nihil fit!" said the Boy,
                        enthusiastically. The Philosopher gazed at the Child. A strange presence
                        seemed to transfuse and possess him. Over the brow of the Boy glittered the
                        pale nimbus of the Student.</p>
                     <p>"Ah, and Schiller's <title>Robbers,</title> too?" queried the
                        Philosopher.</p>
                     <p>"Das ist ausgespielt," said the Boy modestly.</p>
                     <p>"Then you have read my translation of <title>Schiller's</title>
                        <title>Ballad's</title>?" continued the Baronet, with some show of
                        interest.</p>
                     <p>"I have, and infinitely prefer them to the original," said the Boy, with
                        intellectual warmth. "You have shown how in Actual life we strive for a Goal
                        we cannot reach; how in the Ideal the Goal is attainable, and there effort
                        is victory. You have given us the Antithesis which is a key to the
                        Remainder, and constantly balances before us the conditions of the Actual
                        and the privileges of the Ideal."</p>
                     <p>"My very words," said the Baronet; "wonderful, wonderful!" and he gazed
                        fondly at the Italian boy, who again resumed his menial employment. Alas!
                        the wings of the Ideal were folded. The Student had been absorbed in the
                        Boy.</p>
                     <p>But Sir Edward's boots were blacked, and he turned to depart. Placing his
                        hand upon the clustering tendrils that surrounded the classic nob of the
                        infant Italian, he said softly, like a strain of distant music:</p>
                     <p>"Boy, you have done well. Love the Good. Protect the Innocent. Provide for
                        The Indigent. Respect the Philosopher."...."Stay! Can you tell me what
                           <emph>is</emph> The True, The Beautiful, The Innocent, The Virtuous?</p>
                     <p>"They are things that commence with a capital letter," said the Boy,
                        promptly.</p>
                     <p>"Enough! Respect everything that commences with a capital letter! Respect
                        ME!" and dropping a half-penny in the hand of the Boy, he departed.</p>
                     <p>The Boy gazed fixedly at the coin. A frightful<pb n="52-53"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000029"/> and instantaneous change overspread his
                        features. His noble brow was corrugated with baser lines of calculation. His
                        black eye, serpent-like, glittered with suppressed passion. Dropping upon
                        his hands and feet, he crawled to the curbstone and hissed after the
                        retreating form of the Baronet, the single word:</p>
                     <p>"Bilk!"</p>

                     <head type="sub">IN THE WORLD.</head>
                     <p>"ELEVEN years ago," said Sir Edward to himself, as his brougham slowly
                        rolled him toward the Committee Room; "just eleven years ago my natural son
                        disappeared mysteriously. I have no doubt in the world but that this little
                        bootblack is he. His mother died in Italy. He resembles his mother very
                        much. Perhaps I ought to provide for him. Shall I disclose myself? No! no!
                        Better he should taste the sweets of Labor. Penury ennobles the mind and
                        kindles the Love of the Beautiful. I will act to him, not like a Father, not
                        like a Guardian, not like a Friend—but like a Philosopher!"</p>
                     <p>With these words, Sir Edward entered the Committee Room. His Secretary
                        approached him. "Sir Edward, there are fears of a division in the House, and
                        the Prime Minister has sent for you."</p>
                     <p>"I will be there," said Sir Edward, as he placed his hand on his chest and
                        uttered a hollow cough!</p>
                     <p>No one who heard the Baronet that night, in his sarcastic and withering
                        speech on the Drainage and Sewerage Bill, would have recognized the lover of
                        the Ideal and the Philosopher of the Beautiful. No one who listened to his
                        eloquence would have dreamed of the Spartan resolution this iron man had
                        taken in regard to the Lost Boy—his own beloved Lionel. None!</p>
                     <p>"A fine speech from Sir Edward, to-night," said Lord Billingsgate, as,
                        arm-and-arm with the Premier, he entered his carriage.</p>
                     <p>"Yes! but how dreadfully he coughs!"</p>
                     <p>"Exactly. Dr. Bolus says his lungs are entirely gone; he breathes entirely
                        by an effort of will, and altogether independent of pulmonary
                        assistance."</p>
                     <p>"How strange!" and the carriage rolled awaw.</p>

                     <p>And as the Seer spoke, the awful Presence glided out of Nothingness, and
                        sat, sphinxlike, at the feet of the Alchemist.</p>

                     <p>"You should say, 'I have come'—it's better grammar," said the Boy-Neophyte,

                     <p>"Hush, rash Boy," said the Seer sternly. "Would you oppose your feeble

                     <p>The Boy breathed a silent prayer, and handing a sealed package to the Seer,
                        begged him to hand it to his father in case of his premature decease.</p>
                     <p>"You have sent for me," hissed the Presence. "Behold me, Apokatharticon—the

                        am the Unattainable, the Intangible, the Cause and the Effect. In me observe

                     <p>And the veiled Son of the Starbeam laid himself loosely about the room, and

                     <p>AFTER the events related in the last chapter, the reader will perceive that
                        nothing was easier than to reconcile Sir Edward to his son Lionel, nor to
                        resuscitate the beautiful Italian girl, who, it appears, was not dead, and
                        to cause Sir Edward to marry his first and boyish love whom he had deserted.
                        They were married in St. George's, Hanover Square. As the bridal party stood
                        before the altar, Sir Edward, with a sweet sad smile, said, in quite his old

                     <p>DON'T tell me that it wasn't a knocker. I had seen it often enough, and I
                        ought to know. So ought the three o'clock beer, in dirty high-lows, swinging
                        himself over the railing, or executing a demoniacal jig upon the doorstep;
                        so ought the butcher, although butchers as a general thing are scornful of
                        such trifles; so ought the postman, to whom knockers of the most extravagant
                        description were merely human weaknesses, that were to be pitied and used.
                        And so ought, for the matter of that, etc., etc., etc.</p>
                     <p>But then it was <emph>such</emph> a knocker. A wild, extravagant and utterly
                        incomprehensible knocker. A knocker so mysterious and suspicious that
                        Policeman man X 37, first coming upon it, felt inclined to take it instantly
                        in custody, but compromised with his professional instincts by sharply and
                        sternly noting it with an eye that admitted of no nonsense, but confidently
                        expected to detect its secret yet. An ugly knocker; a knocker with a hard,
                        human face, that was a type of the harder human face within. A human face
                        that held between its teeth a brazen rod. So hereafter, in the mysterious
                        future should be held, etc., etc.</p>
                     <p>But if the knocker had a fierce human aspect in the glare of day, you should
                        have seen it at night, when it peered out of the gathering shadows and
                        suggested an ambushed figure; when the light of the street lamps fell upon
                        it, and wrought a play of sinister expression in its hard outlines; when it
                        seemed to wink meaningly at a shrouded figure who, as the night fell darkly,
                        crept up the steps and passed into the mysterious house; when the swinging
                        door disclosed a black passage into which the figure seemed to lose itself
                        and become a part of the mysterious gloom; when the night grew boisterous
                        and the fierce wind made furious charges at the knocker, as if to wrench it
                        off and carry it away in triumph. Such a night as this.</p>
                     <p>It was a wild and pitiless wind. A wind that had commenced life as a gentle
                        country zephyr, but wandering through manufacturing towns had become de
                        moralized, and reaching the city had plunged into extravagant dissipation
                        and wild excesses. A roystering wind that indulged in Bacchanalian shouts
                           on<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6642-00000032"/> the street corners, that
                        knocked off the hats from the heads of helpless passengers, and then
                        fulfilled its duties by speeding away, like all young prodigals—to sea.</p>
                     <p>He sat alone in a gloomy library listening to the wind that roared in the
                        chimney. Around him novels and story-books were strewn thickly; in his lap
                        he held one with its pages freshly cut, and turned the leaves wearily until
                        his eyes rested upon a portrait in its frontispiece. And as the wind howled
                        the more fiercely, and the darkness without fell blacker, a strange and
                        fateful likeness to that portrait appeared above his chair and leaned upon
                        his shoulder. The Haunted Man gazed at the portrait and sighed. The figure
                        gazed at the portrait and sighed too.</p>
                     <p>"Here again?" said the Haunted Man.</p>
                     <p>"Here again," it repeated in a low voice.</p>
                     <p>"Another novel?"</p>
                     <p>"Another novel."</p>
                     <p>"The old story?"</p>
                     <p>"The old story."</p>
                     <p>"I see a child," said the Haunted Man, gazing from the pages of the book
                        into the fire—"a most unnatural child, a model infant. It is prematurely old
                        and philosophic. It dies in poverty to slow music. It dies surrounded by
                        luxury to slow music. It dies with an accompaniment of golden water and
                        rattling carts to slow music. Previous to its decease it makes a will; it
                        repeats the Lord's prayer, it kisses the 'boofer lady.' That child——"</p>
                     <p>"Is mine," said the phantom.</p>
                     <p>"I see a good woman, undersized. I see several charming women, but they are
                        all undersized. They are more or less imbecile and idiotic, but always
                        fascinating and undersized. They wear coquettish caps and aprons. I observe
                        that feminine virtue is invariably below the medium height, and that it is
                        always babyish and infantine. These women——"</p>
                     <p>"Are mine."</p>
                     <p>"I see a haughty, proud, and wicked lady. She is tall and queenly. I remark
                        that all proud and wicked women are tall and queenly. That woman——"</p>
                     <p>"Is mine," said the phantom, wringing his hands.</p>
                     <p>"I see several things continually impending. I observe that whenever an
                        accident, a murder, or death is about to happen, there is something in the
                        furniture, in the locality, in the atmosphere that foreshadows and suggests
                        it years in advance. I cannot say that in real life I have noticed it—the
                        perception of this surprising fact belongs——"</p>
                     <p>"To me!" said the phantom. The Haunted Man continued, in a despairing
                        tone:</p>
                     <p>"I see the influence of this in the magazines and daily papers: I see weak
                        imitators rise up and enfeeble the world with senseless formula. I am
                        getting tired of it. It won't do, Charles! it won't do!" and the Haunted Man
                        buried his head in his hands and groaned. The figure looked down upon him
                        sternly: the portrait in the frontispiece frowned as he gazed.</p>
                     <p>"Wretched man," said the phantom, "and how have these things affected
                        you?"</p>
                     <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6642-00000033"/>
                     <p>"Once I laughed and cried, but then I was younger. Now, I would forget them
                        if I could."</p>
                     <p>"Have then your wish. And take this with you, man whom I renounce. From this
                        day henceforth you shall live with those whom I displace. Without forgetting
                        me, 'twill be your lot to walk through life as if we had not met. But first
                        you shall survey these scenes that henceforth must be yours. At one
                        to-night, prepare to meet the phantom I have raised. Farewell!"</p>
                     <p>The sound of its voice seemed to fade away with the dying wind, and the
                        Haunted Man was alone. But the firelight flickered gayly, and the light
                        danced on the walls, making grotesque figures of the furniture.</p>
                     <p>"Ha, ha!" said the Haunted Man, rubbing his hands gleefully; "now for a
                        whiskey punch and a cigar."</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE SECOND PHANTOM.</head>
                     <p>ONE! The stroke of the far-off bell had hardly died before the front door
                        closed with a reverberating clang. Steps were heard along the passage; the
                        library door swung open of itself, and the Knocker—yes, the Knocker—slowly
                        strode into the room. The Haunted Man rubbed his eyes—no! there could be no
                        mistake about it—it was the Knocker's face, mounted on a misty, almost
                        imperceptible body The brazen rod was transferred from its mouth to its
                        right hand, where it was held like a ghostly truncheon.</p>
                     <p>"It's a cold evening," said the Haunted Man.</p>
                     <p>"It is," said the Goblin, in a hard, metallic voice.</p>
                     <p>"It must be pretty cold out there," said the Haunted Man, with vague
                        politeness. "Do you ever—will you—take some hot water and brandy?"</p>
                     <p>"No," said the Goblin.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps you'd like it cold, by way of change?" continued the Haunted Man,
                        correcting himself, as he remembered the peculiar temperature with which the
                        Goblin was probably familiar.</p>
                     <p>"Time flies," said the Goblin coldly. "We have no leisure for idle talk.
                        Come!" He moved his ghostly truncheon toward the window, and laid his hand
                        upon the other's arm. At his touch the body of the Haunted Man seemed to
                        become as thin and incorporeal as that of the Goblin himself, and together
                        they glided out of the window into the black and blowy night.</p>
                     <p>In the rapidity of their flight the senses of the Haunted Man seemed to
                        leave him. At length they stopped suddenly.</p>
                     <p>"What do you see?" asked the Goblin.</p>
                     <p>"I see a battlemented medieval castle. Gallant men in mail ride over the
                        drawbridge, and kiss their gauntleted fingers to fair ladies, who wave their
                        lily hands in return. I see fight and fray and tournament. I hear roaring
                        heralds bawling the charms of delicate women, and shamelessly proclaiming
                           their<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6642-00000034"/> lovers. Stay. I see a
                        Jewess about to leap from a battlement. I see knightly deeds, violence,
                        rapine, and a good deal of blood. I've seen pretty much the same at
                        Astley's."</p>
                     <p>"Look again."</p>
                     <p>"I see purple moors, glens, masculine women, barelegged men, priggish book
                        worms, more violence, physical excellence, and blood. Always blood—and the
                        superiority of physical attainments."</p>
                     <p>"And how do you feel now?" said the Goblin.</p>
                     <p>The Haunted Man shrugged his shoulders. "None the better for being carried
                        back and asked to sympathize with a barbarous age."</p>
                     <p>The Goblin smiled and clutched his arm; they again sped rapidly through the
                        black night, and again halted.</p>
                     <p>"What do you see?" said the Goblin.</p>
                     <p>"I see a barrack room, with a mess table, and a group of intoxicated Celtic
                        officers telling funny stories, and giving challenges to duel. I see a young
                        Irish gentleman capable of performing prodigies of valor. I learn
                        incidentally that the acme of all heroism is the cornetcy of a dragoon
                        regiment. I hear a good deal of French! No, thank you," said the Haunted Man
                        hurriedly, as he stayed the waving hand of the Goblin; "I would rather
                           <emph>not</emph> go to the Peninsula, and don't care to have a private
                        interview with Napoleon."</p>
                     <p>Again the Goblin flew away with the unfortunate man, and from a strange
                        roaring below them, he judged they were above the ocean. A ship hove in
                        sight, and the Goblin stayed its flight. "Look," he said, squeezing his
                        companion's arm.</p>
                     <p>The Haunted Man yawned. "Don't you think, Charles, you're rather running
                        this thing into the ground? Of course, it's very moral and instructive, and
                        all that. But ain't there a little too much pantomime about it? Come
                        now!"</p>
                     <p>"Look!" repeated the Goblin, pinching his arm malevolently. The Haunted Man
                        groaned.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, of course, I see Her Majesty's ship Arethusa. Of course I am familiar
                        with her stern First Lieutenant, her eccentric Captain, her one fascinating
                        and several mischievous midshipmen. Of course, I know it's a splendid thing
                        to see all this, and not to be sea-sick. Oh, there the young gentlemen are
                        going to play a trick on the purser. For God's sake, let us go," and the
                        unhappy man absolutely dragged the Goblin away with him.</p>
                     <p>When they next halted, it was at the edge of a broad and boundless prairie,
                        in the middle of an oak opening.</p>
                     <p>"I see," said the Haunted Man, without waiting for his cue, but
                        mechanically, and as if he were repeating a lesson which the Goblin had
                        taught him, "I see the Noble Savage. He is very fine to look at! But I
                        observe under his war paint, feathers and picturesque blanket—dirt, disease,
                        and an unsymmetrical contour. I observe beneath his inflated rhetoric deceit
                        and hypocrisy. Beneath his physical hardihood, cruelty, malice and revenge.
                        The Noble Savage is a humbug. I remarked the same to Mr. Catlin."</p>
                     <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6642-00000035"/>
                     <p>"Come," said the phantom.</p>
                     <p>The Haunted Man sighed, and took out his watch. "Couldn't we do the rest of
                        this another time?"</p>
                     <p>"My hour is almost spent, irreverent being, but there is yet a chance for
                        your reformation. Come!"</p>
                     <p>Again they sped through the night, and again halted. The sound of delicious
                        but melancholy music fell upon their ears.</p>
                     <p>"I see," said the Haunted Man, with something of interest in his manner, "I
                        see an old moss-covered manse beside a sluggish, flowing river. I see weird
                        shapes: witches, Puritans, clergymen, little children, judges, mesmerized
                        maidens, moving to the sound of melody that thrills me with its sweetness
                        and purity.</p>
                     <p>But, although carried along its calm and evenly-flowing current, the shapes
                        are strange and frightful: an eating lichen gnaws at the heart of each; not
                        only the clergymen, but witch, maiden, judge, and Puritan, all wear Scarlet
                        Letters of some kind burned upon their hearts. I am fascinated and thrilled,
                        but I feel a morbid sensitiveness creeping over me. I—I beg your pardon."
                        The Goblin was yawning frightfully. "Well, perhaps, we had better go."</p>
                     <p>"One more, and the last," said the Goblin. They were moving home. Streaks of
                        red were beginning to appear in the eastern sky. Along the banks of the
                        blackly flowing river by moorland and stagnant fens, by low houses,
                        clustering close to the water's edge, like strange mollusks, crawled upon
                        the beach to dry; by misty black barges, the more misty and indistinct seen
                        through its mysterious veil, the river fog was slowing rising. So rolled
                        away and rose from the heart of the Haunted Man, etc., etc.</p>
                     <p>They stopped before a quaint mansion of red brick. The Goblin waved his hand
                        without speaking.</p>
                     <p>"I see," said the Haunted Man, "a gay drawing-room. I see my old friends of
                        the club, of the college, of society, even as they lived and moved. I see
                        the gallant and unselfish men, whom I have loved, and the snobs whom I have
                        hated. I see strangely mingling with them, and now and then blending with
                        their forms, our old friends Dick Steele, Addison, and Congreve. I observe,
                        though, that these gentlemen have a habit of getting too much in the way.
                        The royal standard of Queen Anne, not in itself a beautiful ornament, is
                        rather too prominent in the picture. The long galleries of black oak, the
                        formal furniture, the old portraits, are picturesque, but depressing. The
                        house is damp. I enjoy myself better here on the lawn, where they are
                        getting up a Vanity Fair. See, the bell rings, the curtain is rising, the
                        puppets are brought out for a new play. Let me see."</p>
                     <p>The Haunted Man was pressing forward in his eagerness, but the hand of the
                        Goblin stayed him, and pointing to his feet, he saw between him and the
                        rising curtain, a new-made grave. And bending above the grave in passionate
                        grief, the Haunted Man beheld the phantom of the previous night.</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>The Haunted Man started, and—woke. The<pb n="66-67"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000036"/> bright sunshine streamed into the room. The
                        air was sparkling with frost. He ran joyously to the window and opened it. A
                        small boy saluted him with "Merry Christmas." The Haunted Man instantly gave
                        him a Bank of England note. "How much like Tiny Tim, Tom and Bobby that boy
                        looked—bless my soul, what a genius this Dickens has!"</p>
                     <p>A knock at the door, and Boots entered.</p>
                     <p>"Consider your salary doubled instantly. Have you read <title>David

                     <p>The man instantly burst into a torrent of tears, and then into a roar of
                        laughter.</p>
                     <p>"Enough! Here are five thousand pounds. Open a porter-house, and call it,
                        'Our Mutual Friend.' Huzza! I feel so happy!" And the Haunted Man danced
                        about the room.</p>
                     <p>And so, bathed in the light of that blessed sun, and yet glowing with the
                        warmth of a good action, the Haunted Man, haunted no longer, save by those
                        shapes which make the dreams of children beautiful, reseated himself in his
                        chair, and finished <title>Our Mutual Friend.</title>

                        drowned woman in the foreground. A few bracelets, coral necklaces, and other
                        articles of jewelry, scattered around loosely, complete this remarkable
                        picture.</p>
                     <p>It is one which, in some vague, unconscious way, symbolizes, to my fancy,
                        the character of a man. I have never been able to explain exactly why. I
                        think I must have seen the picture in some illustrated volume, when a baby,
                        or my mother may have dreamed it before I was born.</p>

                     <p>As a child I was not handsome. When I consulted the triangular bit of
                        looking-glass which I always carried with me, it showed a pale, sandy and
                        freckled face, shaded by locks like the color of seaweed when the sun
                        strikes it in deep water. My eyes were said to be indistinctive; they were a
                        faint, ashen gray; but above them rose—my only beauty—a high, massive,
                        domelike forehead, with polished temples, like door-knobs of the purest
                        porcelain.</p>
                     <p>Our family was a family of governesses. My mother had been one, and my
                        sisters had the same occupation. Consequently, when at the age of thirteen,
                        my eldest sister handed me the advertisement of Mr. Rawjester, clipped from
                        that day's <title>Times,</title> I accepted it as my destiny. Nevertheless,
                        a mysterious presentiment of an indefinite future haunted me in my dreams
                        that night, as I lay upon my little snow-white bed. The next morning, with
                        two band-boxes tied up in silk handkerchiefs, and a hair trunk, I turned my
                        back upon Minerva Cottage forever.</p>

                     <p>BLUNDERBORE HALL, the seat of James Rawjester, Esq., was encompassed by dark
                        pines and funereal hemlocks on all sides. The wind sang weirdly in the
                        turrets and moaned through the long-drawn avenues of the park. As I
                        approached the house I saw several mysterious figures flit before the
                        windows, and a yell of demoniac laughter answered my summons at the bell.
                        While I strove to repress my gloomy forebodings, the housekeeper, a timid,
                        scared looking old woman, showed me into the library.</p>
                     <p>I entered, overcome with conflicting emotions. I was dressed in a narrow
                        gown of dark serge, trimmed with black bugles. A thick green shawl was
                        pinned across my breast. My hands were encased with black half-mittens
                        worked with steel beads; on my feet were large pattens, originally the
                        property of my deceased grandmother. I carried a blue cotton umbrella. As I
                        passed before a mirror, I could not help glancing at it, nor could I
                        disguise from myself the fact that I was not handsome.</p>
                     <p>Drawing a chair into a recess, I sat down with folded hands, calmly awaiting
                        the arrival of my master. Once or twice a fearful yell rang through the
                        house, or the rattling of chains, and curses uttered in a deep, manly voice,
                        broke upon the oppressive stillness. I began to feel my soul rising with the
                        emergency of the moment.</p>
                     <p>"You look alarmed, miss. You don't hear anything, my dear, do you?" asked
                        the housekeeper nervously.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing whatever," I remarked calmly, as a terrific scream, followed by the
                        dragging of chairs and tables in the room above, drowned for a moment my
                        reply. "It is the silence, on the contrary, which has made me foolishly
                        nervous."</p>
                     <p>The housekeeper looked at me approvingly, and instantly made some tea for
                        me.</p>
                     <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6642-00000038"/>
                     <p>I drank seven cups; as I was beginning the eighth, I heard a crash, and the
                        next moment a man leaped into the room through the broken window.</p>

                  <div type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                     <p>THE crash startled me from my self-control. The housekeeper bent toward me
                        and whispered:</p>
                     <p>"Don't be excited. It's Mr. Rawjester—he prefers to come in sometimes in
                        this way. It's his playfulness, ha! ha! ha!"</p>
                     <p>"I perceive," I said calmly. "It's the unfettered impulse of a lofty soul
                        breaking the tyrannizing bonds of custom," and I turned toward him.</p>
                     <p>He had never once looked at me. He stood with his back to the fire, which
                        set off the herculean breadth of his shoulders. His face was dark and
                        expressive; his under jaw squarely formed, and remarkably heavy. I was
                        struck with his remarkable likeness to a Gorilla.</p>
                     <p>As he absently tied the poker into hard knots with his nervous fingers, I
                        watched him with some interest. Suddenly he turned toward me:</p>
                     <p>"Do you think I'm handsome, young woman?"</p>
                     <p>"Not classically beautiful," I returned calmly; "but you have, if I may so
                        express myself, an abstract manliness—a sincere and wholesome barbarity
                        which, involving as it does the naturalness"—but I stopped, for he yawned at
                        that moment—an action which singularly developed the immense breadth of his
                        lower jaw—and I saw he had forgotten me. Presently he turned to the
                        housekeeper:</p>
                     <p>"Leave us."</p>
                     <p>The old woman withdrew with a courtesy.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rawjester deliberately turned his back upon me and remained silent for
                        twenty minutes. I drew my shawl the more closely around my shoulders and
                        closed my eyes.</p>
                     <p>"You are the governess?" at length he said.</p>
                     <p>"I am, sir."</p>
                     <p>"A creature who teaches geography, arithmetic, and the use of the
                        globes—ha!—a wretched remnant of femininity—a skimp pattern of girlhood with
                        a premature flavor of tealeaves and morality. Ugh!"</p>
                     <p>I bowed my head silently.</p>
                     <p>"Listen to me, girl!" he said sternly; "this child you have come to teach—my
                        ward—is not legitimate. She is the offspring of my mistress—a common harlot.
                        Ah! Miss Mix, what do you think of me now?"</p>
                     <p>"I admire," I replied calmly, "your sincerity. A mawkish regard for delicacy
                        might have kept this disclosure to yourself. I only recognize in your
                        frankness that perfect community of thought and sentiment which should exist
                        between original natures."</p>
                     <p>I looked up; he had already forgotten my presence, and was engaged in
                        pulling off his boots and coat. This done, he sank down in an arm-chair
                        before the fire, and ran the poker wearily through his hair. I could not
                        help pitying him.</p>
                     <pb n="72" xml:id="VAC6642-00000039"/>
                     <p>The wind howled dismally without, and the rain beat furiously against the
                        windows. I crept toward him and seated myself on a low stool beside his
                        chair.</p>
                     <p>Presently he turned, without seeing me, and placed his foot absently in my
                        lap. I affected not to notice it. But he started and looked down.</p>
                     <p>"You here yet—Carrothead? Ah, I forgot. Do you speak French?"</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Oui, Monsieur.</foreign>"</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Taisez-vous!</foreign>" he said sharply, with
                        singular purity of accent. I complied. The wind moaned fearfully in the
                        chimney, and the light burned dim. I shuddered in spite of myself. "Ah, you
                        tremble, girl!"</p>
                     <p>"It is a fearful night."</p>
                     <p>"Fearful! Call you this fearful, ha! ha! ha! Look! you wretched little atom,
                        look!" and he dashed forward, and, leaping out of the window, stood like a
                        statue in the pelting storm, with folded arms. He did not stay long, but in
                        a few minutes returned by way of the hall chimney. I saw from the way that
                        he wiped his feet on my dress that he had again forgotten my presence.</p>
                     <p>"You are a governess. What can you teach?" he asked, suddenly and fiercely
                        thrusting his face in mine.</p>
                     <p>"Manners!" I replied calmly.</p>
                     <p>"Ha! teach <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"You mistake yourself," I said, adjusting my mittens. "Your manners require

                        ferociousness is simply the sincerity which is the basis of a proper

                     <p>He seized a heavy candlestick, and threw it at me. I dodged it submissively
                        but firmly.</p>
                     <p>"Excuse me," he remarked, as his under jaw slowly relaxed. "Excuse me, Miss

                     <p>I FOLLOWED the housekeeper as she led the way timidly to my room. As we
                        passed into a dark hall in the wing, I noticed that it was closed by an iron
                        gate with a grating. Three of the doors on the corridor were likewise
                        grated. A strange noise, as of shuffling feet, and the howling of infuriated
                        animals rang through the hall. Bidding the housekeeper good night, and
                        taking the candle, I entered my bedchamber.</p>
                     <p>I took off my dress, and, putting on a yellow flannel night-gown, which I
                        could not help feeling did not agree with my complexion, I composed myself
                        to rest by reading <title>Blair's Rhetoric</title> and <title>Paley's Moral
                           Philosophy.</title> I had just put out the light, when I heard voices in
                        the corridor. I listened attentively. I recognized Mr. Rawjester's stern
                        tones.</p>
                     <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6642-00000041"/>
                     <p>"Have you fed No. 1?" he asked.</p>
                     <p>"Yes sir," said a gruff voice, apparently belonging to a domestic.</p>
                     <p>"How's No. 2?"</p>
                     <p>"She's a little off her feed, just now, but will pick up in a day or
                        two!"</p>
                     <p>"And No. 3?"</p>
                     <p>"Perfectly furious, sir. Her tantrums are ungovernable."</p>
                     <p>"Hush!"</p>
                     <p>The voices died away, and I sank into a fitful slumber.</p>
                     <p>I dreamed that I was wandering through a tropical forest. Suddenly I saw the
                        figure of a gorilla approaching me. As it neared me, I recognized the
                        features of Mr. Rawjester. He held his hand to his side as if in pain. I saw
                        that he had been wounded. He recognized me and called me by name, but at the
                        same moment the vision changed to an Ashantee village, where, around the
                        fire, a group of negroes were dancing and participating in some wild <hi
                           rend="i"/>Obi festival. I awoke with the strain still surging in my
                        ears.</p>
                     <p>Hokee-pokee wokee fum!"</p>
                     <p>Good Heavens! could I be dreaming? I heard the voice distinctly on the floor
                        below, and smelt something burning. I arose, with an indistinct presentiment
                        of evil, and hastily putting some cotton in my ears and tying a towel about
                        my head, I wrapped myself in a shawl and rushed down stairs. The door of Mr.
                        Rawjester's room was open. I entered.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rawjester lay apparently in a deep slumber, from which even the clouds
                        of smoke that came from the burning curtains of his bed could not rouse him.
                        Around the room a large and powerful negress, scantily attired, with her
                        head adorned with feathers, was dancing wildly, accompanying herself with
                        bone castanets. It looked like some terrible <foreign>fetich.</foreign>
                     </p>
                     <p>I did not lose my calmness. After firmly emptying the pitcher, basin and
                        slop-jar on the burning bed, I proceeded cautiously to the garden, and,
                        returning with the garden-engine, I directed a small stream at Mr.
                        Rawjester.</p>
                     <p>At my entrance the gigantic negress fled. Mr. Rawjester yawned and woke. I
                        explained to him, as he rose dripping from the bed, the reason of my
                        presence. He did not seem to be excited, alarmed or discomposed. He gazed at
                        me curiously.</p>
                     <p>"So you risked your life to save mine, eh? you canary-colored teacher of
                        infants?"</p>
                     <p>I blushed modestly, and drew my shawl tightly over my yellow flannel
                        night-gown.</p>
                     <p>"You love me, Mary Jane—don't deny it! This trembling shows it!" He drew me
                        closely toward him, and said, with his deep voice tenderly modulated:</p>
                     <p>"How's her pooty tootens—did she get her 'ittle tootens wet—bess her?"</p>
                     <p>I understood his allusion to my feet. I glanced down and saw that in my
                        hurry I had put on a pair of his old India-rubbers. My feet were not small
                        or pretty, and the addition did not add to their beauty.</p>
                     <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6642-00000042"/>
                     <p>"Let me go, sir," I remarked quietly. "This is all improper; it sets a bad
                        example for your child;" and I firmly but gently extricated myself from his
                        grasp. I approached the door. He seemed for a moment buried in deep
                        thought.</p>
                     <p>"You say this was a negress?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Humph, No. 1, I suppose?"</p>
                     <p>"Who is Number One, sir?"</p>
                     <p>"My <emph>first,"</emph> he remarked, with a significant and sarcastic
                        smile. Then, relapsing into his old manner, he threw his boots at my head,
                        and bade me begone. I withdrew calmly.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                     <p>MY pupil was a bright little girl, who spoke French with a perfect accent.
                        Her mother had been a French ballet-dancer, which probably accounted for it.
                        Although she was only six years old, it was easy to perceive that she had
                        been several times in love. She once said to me:</p>
                     <p>"Miss Mix, did you ever have the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">grande</foreign>
                        passion? Did you ever feel a fluttering here?" and she placed her hand upon
                        her small chest, and sighed quaintly, "a kind of distaste for <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">bonbons</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >caromels,</foreign> when the world seemed as tasteless and hollow as a
                        broken cordial drop."</p>
                     <p>"Then you have felt it, Nina?" I said quietly.</p>
                     <p>"O dear, yes. There was Buttons—that was our page, you know—I loved him
                        dearly, but papa sent him away. Then there was Dick, the groom, but he
                        laughed at me, and I suffered misery!" and she struck a tragic French
                        attitude. "There is to be company here to-morrow," she added, rattling on
                        with childish <foreign xml:lang="FRA">naïveté,</foreign> "and papa's
                        sweetheart—Blanche Marabout—is to be here. You know they say she is to be my
                        mamma."</p>
                     <p>What thrill was this shot through me? But I rose calmly, and administering a
                        slight correction to the child, left the apartment.</p>
                     <p>Blunderbore House, for the next week, was the scene of gaiety and merriment.
                        That portion of the mansion closed with a grating was walled up, and the
                        midnight shrieks no longer troubled me.</p>
                     <p>But I felt more keenly the degradation of my situation. I was obliged to
                        help Lady Blanche at her toilette and help her to look beautiful. For what?
                        To captivate him? Oh—no, no—but why this sudden thrill and faintness? Did he
                        really love her? I had seen him pinch and swear at her. But I reflected that
                        he had thrown a candlestick at my head, and my foolish heart was
                        reassured.</p>
                     <p>It was a night of festivity, when a sudden message obliged Mr. Rawjester to
                        leave his guests for a few hours. "Make yourselves merry, idiots," he added,
                        under his breath, as he passed me. The door closed and he was gone.</p>
                     <p>An half hour passed. In the midst of the dancing a shriek was heard, and out
                        of the swaying crowd of fainting women and excited men, a wild figure strode
                        into the room. One glance showed it<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6642-00000043"/>
                        to be a highwayman, heavily armed, holding a pistol in each hand.</p>
                     <p>"Let no one pass out of this room!" he said, in a voice of thunder. "The
                        house is surrounded and you cannot escape. The first one who crosses yonder
                        threshold will be shot like a dog. Gentlemen, I'll trouble you to approach
                        in single file, and hand me your purses and watches."</p>
                     <p>Finding resistance useless, the order was ungraciously obeyed.</p>
                     <p>"Now, ladies, please to pass up your jewelry and trinkets."</p>
                     <p>This order was still more ungraciously complied with. As Blanche handed to
                        the bandit captain her bracelet, she endeavored to conceal a diamond
                        necklace, the gift of Mr. Rawjester, in her bosom. But, with a demoniac
                        grin, the powerful brute tore it from its concealment, and administering a
                        hearty box on the ear of the young girl, flung her aside.</p>
                     <p>It was now my turn. With a beating heart, I made my way to the robber
                        chieftain, and sank at his feet. "Oh, sir, I am nothing but a poor
                        governess, pray let me go."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, ho! A governess? Give me your last month's wages, then. Give me what
                        you have stolen from your master!" and he laughed fiendishly.</p>
                     <p>I gazed at him quietly, and said, in a low voice, "I have stolen nothing
                        from you, Mr. Rawjester!"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, discovered! Hush! listen, girl!" he hissed, in a fiercer whisper,
                        "utter a syllable to frustrate my plans and you die—aid me, and—" but he was
                        gone.</p>
                     <p>In a few moments the party, with the exception of myself, were gagged and
                        locked in the cellar. The next moment torches were applied to the rich
                        hangings, and the house was in flames. I felt a strong hand seize me, and
                        bear me out in the open air and place me upon the hillside, where I could
                        overlook the burning mansion. It was Mr. Rawjester.</p>
                     <p>"Burn!" he said, as he shook his fist at the flames. Then sinking on his
                        knees before me, he said hurriedly:</p>
                     <p>"Mary Jane, I love you; the obstacles to our union are or will be soon
                        removed. In yonder mansion were confined my three crazy wives. One of them,
                        as you know, attempted to kill me! Ha! this is vengeance! But will you be
                        mine?"</p>
                     <p>I fell, without a word, upon his neck.</p>

                     <p>A DINGY, swashy, splashy afternoon in October; a school-yard filled with a
                        mob of riotous boys. A lot of us standing outside.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous
                        interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:</p>
                     <p>"What's up, Smithums?"</p>
                     <p>"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form," he replied.</p>
                     <p>At the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from
                        whence the bright Norman man blood streamed redly. To him the plebeian
                        Smithsye laughingly:</p>
                     <p>"Cully! how's his nibs?"</p>
                     <p>I pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a
                        man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized
                        conflagration to the pious Æneas, and made an impression on him which he
                        carried away with the feeble Anchises.</p>
                     <p>In the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam
                        engine, stood Guy Heavy-stone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys
                        on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company.</p>
                     <p>I will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only
                        fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight
                        pastern showed him to be a thorough-bred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in
                        the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering
                        but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face—the old
                        Heavystone look—a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which,
                        in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional
                        ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square set and herculean frame.
                        A striped knit undershirt, close fitting striped tights, and a few spangles
                        set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was
                        displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >regardant</foreign> on a dunghill <emph>or,</emph> and the motto, "Devil
                        a better!"</p>
                     <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6642-00000045"/>
                     <p>I thought of Horatius on the bridge, of Hector before the walls. I always
                        make it a point to think of something classical at such times.</p>
                     <p>He saw me, and his sternness partly relaxed. Something like a smile
                        struggled through his grim lineaments. It was like looking on the Jungfrau
                        after having seen Mont Blanc—a trifle, only a trifle less sublime and awful.
                        Resting his hand lightly on the shoulder of the head-master, who shuddered
                        and collapsed under his touch, he strode toward me.</p>
                     <p>His walk was peculiar. You could not call it a stride. It was like the
                        "crest-tossing Bellerophon"—a kind of prancing gait. Guy Heavystone pranced
                        toward me.</p>

                     <p>IT was the winter of 186-, when I next met Guy Heavystone. He had left the
                        University and had entered the 76th "Heavies." "I have exchanged the gown
                        for the sword, you see," he said, grasping my hand, and fracturing the bones
                        of my little finger, as he shook it."</p>
                     <p>I gazed at him with unmixed admiration. He was squarer, sterner and in every
                        way smarter and more remarkable than ever. I began to feel toward this man
                        as Phalaster felt towards Phyrgino, as somebody must have felt toward
                        Archididasculus, as Boswell felt toward Johnson.</p>
                     <p>"Come into my den," he said, and lifting me gently by the seat of my
                        pantaloons, he carried me up stairs and deposited me, before I could
                        apologize, on the sofa. I looked around the room. It was a bachelor's
                        apartment, characteristically furnished in the taste of the proprietor. A
                        few claymores and battle-axes were ranged against the wall, and a culverin,
                        captured by Sir Ralph Heavystone, occupied the corner, the other end of the
                        room being taken up by a light battery. Foils, boxing-gloves, saddles and
                        fishing-poles lay around carelessly. A small pile of billets-doux lay upon a
                        silver salver. The man was not an anchorite, nor yet a Sir Galahad.</p>
                     <p>I never could tell what Guy thought of women. "Poor little beasts," he would
                        often say when the conversation turned on any of his fresh conquests. Then,
                        passing his hand over his marble brow, the old look of stern fixedness of
                        purpose and unflinching severity would straighten the lines of his mouth,
                        and he would mutter, half to himself, "S'death!"</p>
                     <p>"Come with me to Heavystone Grange. The Exmoor Hounds throw off to-morrow.
                        I'll give you a mount," he said, as he amused himself by rolling up a silver
                        candlestick between his fingers. "You shall have <hi rend="i"/>Cleopatra.
                        But stay," he added, thoughtfully; "now I remember, I ordered <hi rend="i"
                        />Cleopatra to be shot this morning."</p>
                     <p>"And why?" I queried.</p>
                     <p>"She threw her rider yesterday and fell on him—"</p>
                     <p>"And killed him?"</p>
                     <p>"No. That's the reason why I have ordered her<pb n="84-85"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000046"/> to be shot. I keep no animals that are not
                        dangerous—I should add—<emph>deadly!"</emph> He hissed the last sentence
                        between his teeth, and a gloomy frown descended over his calm brow.</p>
                     <p>I affected to turn over the tradesman's bills that lay on the table; for,
                        like all of the Heavystone race, Guy seldom paid cash, and said:</p>
                     <p>"You remind me of the time when Leonidas—"</p>
                     <p>"O, bother Leonidas and your classical allusions. Come!"</p>
                     <p>We descended to dinner.</p>

                        country," said my companion, Ralph Mortmain, as we stood upon Dingleby
                        Common before the meet.</p>
                     <p>I looked up and beheld Guy Heavystone bending haughtily over the saddle, as
                        he addressed a beautiful brunette. She was indeed a splendidly groomed and
                        high-spirited woman. We were near enough to overhear the following
                        conversation, which any high-toned reader will recognize as the common and
                        natural expression of the higher classes.</p>
                     <p>"When Diana takes the field the chase is not wholly confined to objects
                           <foreign xml:lang="LAT">feræ naturæ,</foreign>" said Guy, darting a
                        significant glance at his companion. Flora did not shrink either from the
                        glance or the meaning implied in the sarcasm.</p>
                     <p>"If I were looking for an Endymion, now—" she said archly, as she playfully
                        cantered over a few hounds and leaped a five-barred gate.</p>
                     <p>Guy whispered a few words, inaudible to the rest of the party, and
                        curvetting slightly, cleverly cleared two of the huntsmen in a flying leap,
                        galloped up the front steps of the mansion, and dashing at full speed
                        through the hall, leaped through the drawing-room window and rejoined me,
                        languidly, on the lawn.</p>
                     <p>"Be careful of Flora Billingsgate," he said to me, in low stern tones, while
                        his pitiless eye shot a baleful fire. "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Gardez
                           vous!</foreign>"</p>
                     <p>"<foreign xml:lang="GRC">Gnothi seauton,</foreign>" I replied calmly, not
                        wishing to appear to be behind him in perception or verbal felicity.</p>
                     <p>Guy started off in high spirits. He was well carried. He and the first whip,
                        a ten-stone man, were head and head at the last fence, while the hounds were
                        rolling over their fox, a hundred yards farther in the open.</p>
                     <p>But an unexpected circumstance occurred. Coming back, his chestnut mare
                        refused a ten-foot wall. She reared and fell backward. Again he led her up
                        to it lightly; again she refused, falling heavily from the coping. Guy
                        started to his feet. The old pitiless fire shone in his eyes; the old stern
                        look settled<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6642-00000047"/> around his mouth.
                        Seizing the mare by the tail and mane he threw her over the wall. She landed
                        twenty feet on the other side, erect and trembling. Lightly leaping the same
                        obstacle himself, he remounted her. She did not refuse the wall the next
                        time.</p>

                     <p>GUY was in the north of Ireland, cock-shooting. So Ralph Mortmain told me,
                        and also that the match between Mary Brandagee and Guy had been broken off
                        by Flora Billingsgate. "I don't like those Billingsgates," said Ralph,
                        "they're a bad stock. Her father, Smithfield de Billingsgate, had an
                        unpleasant way of turning up the knave from the bottom of the pack. But
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nous verrons;</foreign> let us go and see
                        Guy."</p>
                     <p>The next morning we started for Fin-ma-Coul's Crossing. When I reached the
                        shooting-box, where Guy was entertaining a select company of friends, Flora
                        Billingsgate greeted me with a saucy smile.</p>
                     <p>"Guy was even squarer and sterner than ever. His gusts of passion were more
                        frequent, and it was with difficulty that he could keep an able-bodied
                        servant in his family. His present retainers were more or less maimed from
                        exposure to the fury of their master. There was a strange cynicism, a
                        cutting sarcasm in his address piercing through his polished manner. I
                        thought of Timon, etc., etc.</p>
                     <p>One evening, we were sitting over our Chambertin, after a hard day's work,
                        and Guy was listlessly turning over some letters, when suddenly he uttered a
                        cry. Did you ever hear the trumpeting of a wounded elephant? It was like
                        that.</p>
                     <p>I looked at him with consternation. He was glancing at a letter which he
                        held at arm's length, and snorting, as it were, at it as he gazed. The lower
                        part of his face was stern, but not as rigid as usual. He was slowly
                        grinding between his teeth the fragments of the glass he had just been
                        drinking from. Suddenly, he seized one of his servants, and, forcing the
                        wretch upon his knees, exclaimed with the roar of a tiger:</p>
                     <p>"Dog! why was this kept from me?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, please, sir, Miss Flora said as how it was a reconciliation, from Miss
                        Brandagee, and it was to be kept from you where you would not be likely to
                        see it—and—and—"</p>
                     <p>"Speak, dog! and you—"</p>
                     <p>"I put it among your bills, sir!"</p>
                     <p>With a groan, like distant thunder, Guy fell swooning to the floor.</p>
                     <p>He soon recovered, for the next moment a servant came rushing into the room
                        with the information that a number of the ingenuous peasantry of the
                        neighborhood were about to indulge that evening in the national pastime of
                        burning a farmhouse and shooting a landlord. Guy smiled a fearful smile,
                        without, however, altering his stern and pitiless expression.</p>
                     <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6642-00000048"/>
                     <p>"Let them come," he said calmly; "I feel like entertaining company."</p>
                     <p>We barricaded the doors and windows, and then chose our arms from the
                        armory. Guy's choice was a singular one: it was a landing net with a long
                        handle, and a sharp cavalry sabre.</p>
                     <p>We were not destined to remain long in ignorance of its use. A howl was
                        heard from without, and a party of fifty or sixty armed men precipitated
                        themselves against the door.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the window opened. With the rapidity of lightning, Guy Heavystone
                        cast the net over the head of the ring-leader, ejaculated "<foreign
                           xml:lang="LAT">Habet!</foreign>" and with a back stroke of his cavalry
                        sabre, severed the member from its trunk, and drawing the net back again,
                        cast the gory head upon the floor, saying quietly:</p>
                     <p>"One."</p>
                     <p>Again the net was cast, the steel flashed, the net was withdrawn and an
                        ominous "Two!" accompanied the head as it rolled on the floor.</p>
                     <p>"Do you remember what Pliny says of the gladiator?" said Guy, calmly wiping
                        his sabre. "How graphic is that passage commencing: '<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >Inter nos, etc.</foreign>'" The sport continued until the heads of
                        twenty desperadoes had been gathered in. The rest seemed inclined to
                        disperse. Guy incautiously showed himself at the door; a ringing shot was
                        heard, and he staggered back pierced through the heart. Grasping the door
                        post in the last unconscious throes of his mighty frame, the whole side of
                        the house yielded to that earthquake tremor, and we had barely time to
                        escape before the whole building fell in ruins. I thought of Samson, the
                        Giant Judge, etc., etc.; but all was over.</p>
                     <p>Guy Heavystone had died as he had lived—<emph>hard.</emph>

                     <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                     <p>MY father was a north-country surgeon. He had retired, a widower, from her
                        Majesty's navy many years before, and had a small practice in his native
                        village. When I was seven years old he employed me to carry medicines to his
                        patients. Being of a lively disposition, I sometimes amused myself, during
                        my daily rounds, by mixing the contents of the different phials. Although I
                        had no reason to doubt that the general result of this practice was
                        beneficial, yet, as the death of a consumptive curate followed the addition
                        of a strong mercurial lotion to his expectorant, my father concluded to
                        withdraw me from the profession and send me to school.</p>
                     <p>Grubbins, the schoolmaster, was a tyrant, and it was not long before my
                        impetuous and self-willed nature rebelled against his authority. I soon
                        began to form plans of revenge. In this I was assisted by Tom Snaffle—a
                        schoolfellow. One day Tom suggested:</p>
                     <p>"Suppose we blow him up. I've got two pounds of powder!"</p>
                     <p>"No, that's too noisy," I replied.</p>
                     <p>Tom was silent for a minute, and again spoke:</p>
                     <p>"You remember how you flattened out the curate, Pills! Couldn't you give
                        Grubbins something—something to make him leathery sick—eh?"</p>
                     <p>A flash of inspiration crossed my mind. I went to the shop of the village
                        apothecary. He knew me; I had often purchased vitriol, which I poured into
                        Grubbins's inkstand to corrode his pens and burn up his coat-tail, on which
                        he was in the habit of wiping them. I boldly asked for an ounce of
                        chloroform. The young apothecary winked and handed me the bottle.</p>
                     <p>It was Grubbins's custom to throw his handkerchief over his head, recline in
                        his chair and take a short nap during recess. Watching my opportunity, as he
                        dozed, I managed to slip his handkerchief from his face and substitute my
                        own, moistened with chloroform. In a few minutes he was insensible. Tom and
                        I then quickly shaved his head, beard and eyebrows, blackened his face with
                        a mixture of vitriol and burnt cork, and fled. There was a row and scandal
                        the next day. My father always excused me by asserting that Grubbins had got
                        drunk—but somehow found it convenient to procure me an appointment in Her
                        Majesty's navy at an early day.</p>

                     <p>AN official letter, with the Admiralty seal, informed me that I was expected
                        to join H. M. ship Belcher, Captain Boltrope, at Portsmouth, without delay.
                        In a few days I presented myself to a tall, stern-visaged man, who was
                        slowly pacing the leeward side of the quarter-deck. As I touched my hat he
                        eyed me sternly:</p>
                     <p>"So ho! Another young suckling. The service is going to the devil. Nothing
                        but babes in the cockpit and grannies in the board. Boatswain's mate, pass
                        the word for Mr. Cheek!"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Cheek, the steward, appeared and touched his hat. "Introduce Mr. Breezy
                        to the young gentlemen. Stop! Where's Mr. Swizzle?"</p>
                     <p>"At the masthead, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Where's Mr. Lankey?"</p>
                     <p>"At the masthead, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Briggs?"</p>
                     <p>"Masthead, too, sir."</p>
                     <p>"And the rest of the young gentlemen?" roared the enraged officer.</p>
                     <p>"All masthead, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" said Captain Boltrope, as he smiled grimly, "under the circumstances,
                        Mr. Breezy, you had better go to the masthead too."</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                     <p>AT the masthead I made the acquaintance of two youngsters of about my own
                        age, one of whom informed me that he had been there 332 days out of the
                        year.</p>
                     <p>"In rough weather, when the old cock is out of sorts, you know, we never
                        come down," added a young gentleman of nine years, with a dirk nearly as
                        long as himself, who had been introduced to me as Mr. Briggs. "By the way,
                        Pills," he continued, "how did you come to omit giving the captain a naval
                        salute?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, I touched my hat," I said, innocently.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, but that isn't enough, you know. That will do very well at other
                        times. He expects <choice>
                           <sic>the the</sic>

                        </choice> naval salute when you first come on board—greeny!"</p>
                     <p>I began to feel alarmed, and begged him to explain.</p>
                     <p>"Why, you see, after touching your hat, you should have touched him lightly
                        with your forefinger in his waistcoat, so, and asked 'How's his nibs?'—you
                        see?"</p>
                     <p>"How's his nibs?" I repeated.</p>
                     <p>"Exactly. He would have drawn back a little, and then you should have
                        repeated the salute remarking 'How's his royal nibs?' asking cautiously
                        after his wife and family, and requesting to be introduced to the gunner's
                        daughter."</p>
                     <p>"The gunner's daughter?"</p>
                     <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6642-00000051"/>
                     <p>"The same; you know she takes care of us young gentlemen; now don't forget,
                        Pillsy!"</p>
                     <p>When we were called down to the deck I thought it a good chance to profit by
                        this instruction. I approached Captain Boltrope and repeated the salute
                        without conscientiously omitting a single detail. He remained for a moment,
                        livid and speechless. At length he gasped out:</p>
                     <p>"Boatswain's mate?"</p>
                     <p>"If you please, sir," I asked, tremulously, "I should like to be introduced
                        to the gunner's daughter!"</p>
                     <p>"O, very good, sir!" screamed Captain Boltrope, rubbing his hands and
                        absolutely capering about the deck with rage. "O d—n you! Of course you
                        shall! O ho! the gunner's daughter! O, h—ll! this is too much! Boatswain's
                        mate!" Before I well knew where I was, I was seized, borne to an
                        eightpounder, tied upon it and flogged!</p>

                     <p>AS we sat together in the cockpit, picking the weevils out of our biscuit,
                        Briggs consoled me for my late mishap, adding that the "naval salute," as a
                        custom, seemed just then to be honored more in the <emph>breach</emph> than
                        the observance. I joined in the hilarity occasioned by the witticism, and in
                        a few moments we were all friends. Presently Swizzle turned to me:</p>
                     <p>"We have been just planing how to confiscate a keg of claret, which Nips,
                        the purser, keeps under his bunk. The old nipcheese lies there drunk half
                        the day, and there's no getting at it."</p>
                     <p>"Let's get beneath the stateroom and bore through the deck, and so tap it,"
                        said Lankey.</p>
                     <p>The proposition was received with a shout of applause. A long half-inch
                        auger and bit was procured from Chips, the carpenter's mate, and Swizzle,
                        after a careful examination of the timbers beneath the wardroom, commenced
                        operations. The auger at last disappeared, when suddenly there was a slight
                        disturbance on the deck above. Swizzle withdrew the auger hurriedly; from
                        its point a few bright red drops trickled.</p>
                     <p>"Huzza! send her up again!" cried Lankey.</p>
                     <p>The auger was again applied. This time a shriek was heard from the purser's
                        cabin. Instantly the light was doused, and the party retreated hurriedly to
                        the cockpit. A sound of snoring was heard as the sentry stuck his head into
                        the door. "All right, sir," he replied in answer to the voice of the officer
                        of the deck.</p>
                     <p>The next morning we heard that Nips was in the surgeon's hands, with a bad
                        wound in the fleshy part of his leg, and that the auger had <emph>not</emph>
                        struck claret.</p>

                     <p>"NOW, Pills, you'll have a chance to smell powder," said Briggs as he
                        entered the cockpit and<pb n="96" xml:id="VAC6642-00000052"/> buckled around
                        his waist an enormous cutlass. "We have just sighted a French ship."</p>
                     <p>We went on deck. Captain Boltrope grinned as we touched our hats. He hated
                        the purser. "Come, young gentlemen, if you're boring for French claret,
                        yonder's a good quality. Mind your con, sir," he added, turning to the
                        quartermaster, who was grinning.</p>
                     <p>The ship was already cleared for action. The men, in their eagerness, had
                        started the coffee from <choice>
                           <sic>the the</sic>
                           <corr>the</corr>
                        </choice> tubs and filled them with shot. Presently the Frenchman yawed, and
                        a shot from a long thirty-two came skipping over the water. It killed the
                        quartermaster and took off both of Lankey's legs. "Tell the purser our
                        account is squared," said the dying boy, with a feeble smile.</p>
                     <p>The fight raged fiercely for two hours. I remember killing the French
                        Admiral, as we boarded, but on looking around for Briggs, after the smoke
                        had cleared away, I was intensly amused at witnessing the following novel
                        sight:</p>
                     <p>Briggs had pinned the French captain against the mast with his cutlass, and
                        was now engaged, with all the hilarity of youth, in pulling the captain's
                        coat-tails between his legs, in imitation of a dancing-jack. As the
                        Frenchman lifted his legs and arms, at each jerk of Briggs's, I could not
                        help participating in the general mirth.</p>
                     <p>"You young devil, what are you doing?" said a stifled voice behind me. I
                        looked up and beheld Captain Boltrope, endeavoring to calm his stern
                           features<pb n="(Illustration) -97" xml:id="VAC6642-00000053"/>

                        enjoyment of the scene. "Go to the masthead—up with you, sir!" he repeated
                        sternly to Briggs.</p>
                     <p>"Very good, sir," said the boy, coolly preparing to mount the shrouds.
                        "Good-bye, Johnny Crapaud. Humph!" he added, in a tone intended for my ear,
                        "A pretty way to treat a hero—the service is going to the devil!"</p>
                     <p>I thought so too.</p>

                     <p>WE were ordered to the West Indies. Although Captain Boltrope's manner
                        toward me was still severe and even harsh, I understood that my name had
                        been favorably mentioned in the dispatches.</p>
                     <p>Reader were you ever at Jamaica. If so, you remember the negresses, the
                        oranges, Port Royal Tom—the yellow fever. After being two weeks at the
                        station, I was taken sick of the fever. In a month I was delirious. During
                        my paroxysms, I had a wild distempered dream of a stern face bending
                        anxiously over my pillow, a rough hand smoothing my hair, and a kind voice
                        saying:</p>
                     <p>"Bess his 'ittle heart! Did he have the naughty fever!" This face seemed
                        again changed to the well-known stern features of Captain Boltrope.</p>
                     <p>When I was convalescent, a packet edged in black was put in my hand. It
                        contained the news of my<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6642-00000054"/> father's
                        death, and a sealed letter which he had requested to be given to me on his
                        decease. I opened it tremblingly. It read thus:</p>

                                    <hi rend="i"/>"My Dear Boy:—I regret to inform you that in all
                                    probability you are not my son. Your mother, I am grieved to
                                    say, was a highly improper person. Who your father may be, I
                                    really cannot say, but perhaps the Honorable Henry Boltrope,
                                    Captain R. N., may be able to inform you. Circumstances over
                                    which I have no control, have deferred this important
                                    disclosure.</p>

                     <p>And so Captain Boltrope was my father. Heavens! Was it a dream? I recalled
                        his stern manner, his observant eye; his ill-concealed uneasiness when in my
                        presence. I longed to embrace him. Staggering to my feet I rushed in my
                        scanty apparel to the deck where Captain Boltrope was just then engaged in
                        receiving the Governor's wife and daughter. The ladies shrieked; the
                        youngest, a beautiful girl, blushed deeply. Heeding them not, I sank at his
                        feet and embracing them cried:</p>
                     <p>"My Father!"</p>
                     <p>"Chuck him overboard!" roared Captain Boltrope.</p>
                     <p>"Stay," pleaded the soft voice of Clara Maitland, the Governor's
                        daughter.</p>
                     <p>"Shave his head! he's a wretched lunatic!" continued Captain Boltrope, while
                        his voice trembled with excitement.</p>
                     <p>"No, let me nurse and take care of him," said the lovely girl, blushing as
                        she spoke. "Mamma, can't we take him home."</p>
                     <p>The daughter's pleading was not without effect. In the meantime I had
                        fainted. When I recovered my senses I found myself in Governor Maitland's
                        mansion.</p>

                  <div type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                     <p>THE reader will guess what followed. I fell deeply in love with Clara
                        Maitland, to whom I confided the secret of my birth. The generous girl
                        asserted that she had detected the superiority of my manner at once. We
                        plighted our troth, and resolved to wait upon events.</p>
                     <p>Briggs called to see me a few days afterward. He said that the purser had
                        insulted the whole cockpit, and all the midshipmen had called him out. But
                        he added thoughtfully: "I don't see how we can arrange the duel. You see
                        there are six of us to fight him."</p>
                     <p>"Very easily," I replied. "Let your fellows all stand in a row, and take his
                        fire; that, you see, gives him six chances to one, and he must be a bad shot
                        if he can't hit one of you; while, on the other hand, you see, he gets a
                        volley from you six, and one of you'll be certain to fetch him."</p>
                     <p>"Exactly;" and away Briggs went, but soon returned to say that the purser
                        had declined—"like a d—d coward," he added.</p>
                     <p>But the news of the sudden and serious illness of Captain Boltrope put off
                        the duel. I hastened to his<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6642-00000055"/>
                        bedside, but too late—an hour previous he had given up the ghost.</p>
                     <p>I resolved to return to England. I made known the secret of my birth, and
                        exhibited my adopted father's letter to Lady Maitland, who at once suggested
                        my marriage with her daughter, before I returned to claim the property. We
                        were married, and took our departure next day.</p>
                     <p>I made no delay in posting at once, in company with my wife and my friend
                        Briggs, to my native village. Judge of my horror and surprise when my late
                        adopted father came out of his shop to welcome me.</p>
                     <p>"Then you are not dead!" I gasped.</p>
                     <p>"No, my dear boy."</p>
                     <p>"And this letter?"</p>
                     <p>My father—as I must still call him—glanced on the paper, and pronounced it a
                        forgery. Briggs roared with laughter. I turned to him and demanded an
                        explanation.</p>
                     <p>"Why, don't you see, Greeny, it's all a joke—a midshipman's joke!"</p>
                     <p>"But——" I asked.</p>
                     <p>"Don't be a fool. You've got a good wife—be satisfied."</p>
                     <p>I turned to Clara, and was satisfied. Although Mrs. Maitland never forgave
                        me, the jolly old Governor laughed heartily over the joke, and so well used
                        his influence that I soon became, dear reader, Admiral Breezy, K. C. B.</p>

                     <p>"ONE cigar a day!" said Judge Boompointer.</p>
                     <p>"One cigar a day!" repeated John Jenkins, as with trepidation he dropped his
                        half-consumed cigar under his work-bench.</p>
                     <p>"One cigar a day is three cents a day," remarked Judge Boompointer, gravely,
                        "and do you know, sir, what one cigar a day, or three cents a day, amounts
                        to in the course of four years?"</p>
                     <p>John Jenkins, in his boyhood, had attended the village school, and possessed
                        considerable arithmetical ability. Taking up a shingle which lay upon his
                        work-bench, and producing a piece of chalk, with a feeling of conscious
                        pride he made an exhaustive calculation:</p>
                     <p>"Exactly forty three dollars and eighty cents," he replied, wiping the
                        perspiration from his heated<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6642-00000056"/>
                        brow, while his face flushed with honest enthusiasm.</p>
                     <p>"Well, sir, if you saved three cents a day, instead of wasting it, you would
                        now be the possessor of a new suit of clothes, an illustrated Family Bible,
                        a pew in the church, a complete set of Patent Office Reports, a hymn-book,
                        and a paid subscription to <title>Arthur's Home Magazine,</title> which
                        could be purchased for exactly forty-three dollars and eighty cents—and,"
                        added the Judge, with increasing sternness, "if you calculate leap-year,
                        which you seem to have strangely omitted—you have three cents more, sir;
                           <emph>three cents more!</emph>" What would that buy you, sir?"</p>
                     <p>"A cigar," suggested John Jenkins; but, coloring again deeply, he hid his
                        face.</p>
                     <p>"No, sir," said the Judge, with a sweet smile of benevolence stealing over
                        his stern features; "properly invested, it would buy you that which passeth
                        all price. Dropped into the missionary box, who can tell what heathen, now
                        idly and joyously wantoning in nakedness and sin, might be brought to a
                        sense of his miserable condition, and made, through that three cents, to
                        feel the torments of the wicked?"</p>
                     <p>With these words the Judge retired, leaving John Jenkins buried in profound
                        thought. "Three cents a day," he muttered. "In forty years I might be worth
                        four hundred and thirty-eight dollars and ten cents—and then I might marry
                        Mary. Ah, Mary!" The young carpenter sighed, and drawing a twenty-five five
                        cent daguerreotype from his vest pocket, gazed long and fervidly upon the
                        features of a young girl in book muslin and a coral necklace. Then, with a
                        resolute expression, he carefully locked the door of his workshop and
                        departed.</p>
                     <p>Alas! his good resolutions were too late. We trifle with the tide of fortune
                        which too often nips us in the bud and casts the dark shadow of misfortune
                        over the bright lexicon of youth! That night the half-consumed fragment of
                        John Jenkins's cigar set fire to his work-shop and burned it up, together
                        with all his tools and materials. There was no insurance.</p>

                     <p>"THEN you still persist in marrying John Jenkins?" queried Judge
                        Boompointer, as he playfully, with paternal familiarity, lifted the golden
                        curls of the village belle, Mary Jones.</p>
                     <p>"I do," replied the fair young girl, in a low voice, that resembled rock
                        candy in its saccharine firmness; "I do. He has promised to reform. Since he
                        lost all his property by fire——"</p>
                     <p>"The result of his pernicious habit, though he illogically persists in
                        charging it to me," interrupted the Judge.</p>
                     <p>"Since then," continued the young girl, "he has<pb n="104-105"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000057"/> endeavored to break himself of the habit. He
                        tells me that he has substituted the stalks of the Indian ratan the outer
                        part of a leguminous plant called the smoking-bean, and the fragmentary and
                        unconsumed remainder of cigars which occur at rare and uncertain intervals
                        along the road, which, as he informs me, though deficient in quality and
                        strength, are comparatively inexpensive." And, blushing at her own
                        eloquence, the young girl hid her curls on the Judge's arm.</p>
                     <p>"Poor thing," muttered Judge Boompointer. "Dare I tell her all? Yet I
                        must."</p>
                     <p>"I shall cling to him," continued the young girl, rising with her theme, "as
                        the young vine clings to some hoary ruin. Nay, nay, chide me not, Judge
                        Boompointer. I will marry John Jenkins!"</p>
                     <p>The Judge was evidently affected. Seating himself at the table, he wrote a
                        few lines hurriedly upon a piece of paper, which he folded and placed in the
                        fingers of the destined bride of John Jenkins.</p>
                     <p>"Mary Jones," said the Judge, with impressive earnestness, "take this trifle
                        as a wedding gift from one who respects your fidelity and truthfulness. At
                        the altar let it be a reminder of me." And covering his face hastily with a
                        handkerchief, the stern and iron-willed man left the room. As the door
                        closed, Mary unfolded the paper. It was an order on the corner grocery for
                        three yards of flannel, a paper of needles, four pounds of soap, one pound
                        of starch, and two boxes of matches!</p>
                     <p>"Noble and thoughtful man!" was all Mary Jones could exclaim, as she hid her
                        face in her hands and burst into a flood of tears.</p>
                     <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
                     <p>The bells of Cloverdale are ringing merrily. It is a wedding. "How beautiful
                        they look!" is the exclamation that passes from lip to lip, as Mary Jones,
                        leaning timidly on the arm of John Jenkins, enters the church. But the bride
                        is agitated, and the bridegroom betrays a feverish nervousness. As they
                        stand in the vestibule, John Jenkins fumbles earnestly in his vest pocket.
                        Can it be the ring he is anxious about? No. He draws a small brown substance
                        from his pocket, and biting off a piece, hastily replaces the fragment and
                        gazes furtively around. Surely no one saw him? Alas! the eyes of two of that
                        wedding party saw the fatal act. Judge Boompointer shook his head sternly.
                        Mary Jones sighed and breathed a silent prayer. Her husband chewed!</p>

                     <p>"WHAT! more bread?" said John Jenkins, gruffly. "You're always asking for
                        money for bread. D—nation! Do you want to ruin me by your extravagance?" and
                        as he uttered these words he drew from his pocket a bottle of whisky, a pipe
                        and a paper of tobacco. Emptying the first at a draught, he threw the empty
                        bottle at the head of his eldest boy, a youth of twelve summers. The missile
                        struck the child<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6642-00000058"/> full in the
                        temple, and stretched him a lifeless corpse. Mrs. Jenkins, whom the reader

                        her son in her arms, and, carefully placing the unfortunate youth beside the
                        pump in the back-yard, returned with saddened step to the house. At another
                        time, and in brighter days, she might have wept at the occurrence. She was
                        past tears now.</p>
                     <p>"Father, your conduct is reprehensible!" said little Harrison Jenkins, the
                        youngest boy. "Where do you expect to go when you die?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" said John Jenkins, fiercely; "this comes of giving children a liberal
                        education; this is the result of Sabbath schools. Down, viper!"</p>
                     <p>A tumbler thrown from the same parental fist laid out the youthful Harrison
                        cold. The four other children had, in the meantime, gathered around the
                        table with anxious expectancy. With a chuckle, the now changed and brutal
                        John Jenkins produced four pipes, and, filling them with tobacco, handed one
                        to each of his offspring and bade them smoke. "It's better than bread!"
                        laughed the wretch hoarsely.</p>
                     <p>Mary Jenkins, though of a patient nature, felt it her duty now to speak. "I
                        have borne much, John Jenkins," she said. "But I prefer that the children
                        should not smoke. It is an unclean habit, and soils their clothes. I ask
                        this as a special favor!</p>
                     <p>John Jenkins hesitated—the pangs of remorse began to seize him.</p>
                     <p>"Promise me this, John!" urged Mary upon her knees.</p>
                     <p>"I promise!" reluctantly answered John.</p>
                     <p>"And you will put the money in a savings bank?"</p>
                     <p>"I will," repeated her husband; "and <emph>I'll</emph> give up smoking,
                        too."</p>
                     <p>"Tis well, John Jenkins!" said Judge Boompointer, appearing suddenly from
                        behind the door, where he had been concealed during this interview. "Nobly
                        said! my man. Cheer up! I will see that the children are decently buried."
                        The husband and wife fell into each other's arms. And Judge Boompointer,
                        gazing upon the affecting spectacle, burst into tears.</p>
                     <p>From that day John Jenkins was an altered man.</p>

                     <p>I AM upper housemaid to the family that live at No. 27 Limehouse Road,
                        Pultneyville. I have been requested by Mr. Wilkey Collings, which I takes
                        the liberty of here stating is a gentleman born and bred, and has some
                        consideration for the feelings of servants, and is not above rewarding them
                        for their trouble, which is more than you can say for some who ask questions
                        and gets short answers enough, gracious knows, to tell what I know about
                        them. I have been requested to tell my story in my own langwidge, though,
                        being no schollard, mind cannot conceive. I think my master is a brute. Do
                        not know that he has ever attempted to poison my missus—which is too good
                        for him, and how she ever came to marry him, heart only can tell—but believe
                        him to be capable of any such hatrosity. Have heard him swear dreadful
                        because of not having his shaving<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6642-00000060"/>
                        water at 9 o'clock precisely. Do not know whether he ever forged a will or
                        tried to get my missus' property although, not having confidence in the man,
                        should not be surprised if he had done so. Believe that there was always
                        something mysterious in his conduct. Remember distinctly how the family left
                        home to go abroad. Was putting up my back hair, last Saturday morning, when
                        I heard a ring. Says cook, "That's missus' bell, and mind you hurry or the
                        master 'ill know why." Says I, "Humbly thanking you mem, but taking advice
                        of them as is competent to give it, I'll take my time." Found missus
                        dressing herself and master growling as usual. Says missus, quite calm and
                        easy like, "Mary, we begin to pack to-day." "What for, mem," says I, taken
                        aback. "What's that hussy asking?" says master from the bedclothes quite
                        savage like. "For the Continent—Italy," says missus—"Can you go Mary?" Her
                        voice was quite gentle and saintlike, but I knew the struggle it cost, and
                        says I, "With <emph>you</emph> mem, to India's torrid clime, if required,
                        but with African Gorillas," says I, looking toward the bed, "never." "Leave
                        the room," says master, starting up and catching of his bootjack. "Why
                        Charles!" says missus, "how you talk!" affecting surprise. "Do go Mary,"
                        says she, slipping a half-crown into my hand. I left the room scorning to
                        take notice of the odious wretch's conduct.</p>
                     <p>Cannot say whether my master and missus were ever legally married. What with
                        the dreadful state of morals now-a-days and them stories in the circulating
                        ing libraries, innocent girls don't know into what society they might be
                        obliged to take situations. Never saw missus' marriage certificate, though I
                        have quite accidental-like looked in her desk when open, and would have seen
                        it. Do not know of any lovers missus might have had. Believe she had a
                        liking for John Thomas, footman, for she was always spiteful-like—poor
                        lady—when we were together—though there was nothing between us, as Cook well
                        knows, and dare not deny, and missus needn't have been jealous. Have never
                        seen arsenic or Prussian acid in any of the private drawers—but have seen
                        paregoric and camphor. One of my master's friends was a Count Moscow, a
                        Russian papist—which I detested.</p>

                     <head type="sub">THE SLIM YOUNG MAN'S STORY.</head>
                     <p>I AM by profession a reporter, and writer for the press. I live at
                        Pultneyville. I have always had a passion for the marvelous, and have been
                        distinguished for my facility in tracing out mysteries, and solving
                        enigmatical occurrences. On the night of the 17th June, 1845, I left my
                        office and walked homeward. The night was bright and starlight. I was
                        revolving in my mind the words of a singular item I had just read in the
                           <title>Times.</title> I had reached the darkest portion of the road, and
                        found myself mechanically repeating: "An elderly gentleman a week ago<pb
                           n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6642-00000061"/> left his lodgings on the Kent
                        Road," when suddenly I heard a step behind me.</p>
                     <p>I turned quickly, with an expression of horror in my face, and by the light
                        of the newly risen moon beheld an elderly gentleman, with green cotton
                        umbrella, approaching me. His hair, which was snow-white, was parted over a
                        broad, open forehead. The expression of his face, which was slightly
                        flushed, was that of amiability verging almost upon imbecility. There was a
                        strange, inquiring look about the widely-opened mild blue eye—a look that
                        might have been intensified to insanity, or modified to idiocy. As he passed
                        me, he paused and partly turned his face, with a gesture of inquiry. I see
                        him still, his white locks blowing in the evening breeze, his hat a little
                        on the back of his head, and his figure painted in relief against the dark
                        blue sky.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly he turned his mild eye full upon me. A weak smile played about his
                        thin lips. In a voice which had something of the tremulousness of age and
                        the self-satisfied chuckle of imbecility in it, he asked, pointing to the
                        rising moon, "Why?—Hush!"</p>
                     <p>He had dodged behind me, and appeared to be looking anxiously down the road.
                        I could feel his aged frame shaking with terror as he laid his thin hands
                        upon my shoulders and faced me in the direction of the supposed danger.</p>
                     <p>"Hush! did you not hear them coming?"</p>
                     <p>I listened; there was no sound but the soughing of the roadside trees in the
                        evening wind. I endeavored to reassure him, with such success that in a few
                        moments the old weak smile appeared on his benevolent face.</p>
                     <p>"Why?—" But the look of interrogation was succeeded by a hopeless
                        blankness.</p>
                     <p>"Why!" I repeated with assuring accents:</p>
                     <p>"Why," he said, a gleam of intelligence flickering over his face, "is yonder
                        moon, as she sails in the blue empyrean, casting a flood of light o'er hill
                        and dale, like—Why," he repeated, with a feeble smile, "is yonder moon, as
                        she sails in the blue empyrean—" He hesitated—stammered—and gazed at me
                        hopelessly, with the tears dripping from his moist and widely-opened
                        eyes.</p>
                     <p>I took his hand kindly in my own. "Casting a shadow o'er hill and dale," I
                        repeated quietly, leading him up the subject, "like—Come, now."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" he said, pressing my hand tremulously, "you know it?"</p>
                     <p>"I do. Why is it like—the—eh—the commodious mansion on the Limehouse
                        Road?"</p>
                     <p>A blank stare only followed. He shook his head sadly. "Like the young men
                        wanted for a light, genteel employment?"</p>
                     <p>He wagged his feeble old head cunningly.</p>
                     <p>"Or, Mr. Ward," I said with bold confidence, "like the mysterious
                        disappearance from the Kent Road."</p>
                     <p>The moment was full of suspense. He did not seem to hear me. Suddenly he
                        turned.</p>
                     <p>"Ha!"</p>
                     <p>I darted forward. But he had vanished in the darkness.</p>

                     <p>IT was a hot midsummer evening. Limehouse Road was deserted save by dust and
                        a few rattling butchers' carts, and the bell of the muffin and crumpet man.
                        A commodious mansion which stood on the right of the road as you enter
                        Pultneyville surrounded by stately poplars and a high fence surmounted by a
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">chevaux de frise</foreign> of broken glass,
                        looked to the passing and footsore pedestrian like the genius of seclusion
                        and solitude. A bill announcing in the usual terms that the house was to
                        let, hung from the bell at the servants' entrance.</p>
                     <p>As the shades of evening closed, and the long shadows of the poplars
                        stretched across the road, a man carrying a small kettle stopped and gazed,
                        first at the bill and then at the house. When he had reached the corner of
                        the fence, he again stopped and looked cautiously up and down the road.
                        Apparently satisfied with the result of his scrutiny, he deliberately sat
                        himself down in the dark shadow of the fence, and at once busied himself in
                        some employment, so well concealed as to be invisible to the gaze of
                        passers-by. At the end of an hour he retired cautiously.</p>
                     <p>But not altogether unseen. A slim young man, with spectacles and note-book,
                        stepped from behind a tree as the retreating figure of the intruder was lost
                        in the twilight, and transferred from the fence to his note-book the freshly
                        stenciled inscription—"S—T—1860—X."</p>

                     <p>I AM a foreigner. Observe! To be a foreigner in England is to be mysterious,
                        suspicious, intriguing. M. Collins has requested the history of my
                        complicity with certain occurrences. It is nothing—bah—absolutely
                        nothing.</p>
                     <p>I write with ease and fluency. Why should I not write? Tra la la! I am what
                        you English call corpulent. Ha, ha! I am a pupil of Macchiavelli. I find it
                        much better to disbelieve everything, and to approach my subject and wishes
                        circuitously, than in a direct manner. You have observed that playful
                        animal, the cat. Call it, and it does not come to you directly, but rubs
                        itself against all the furniture in the room, and reaches you finally—and
                        scratches. Ah, ha, scratches! I am of the feline species. People call me a
                        villain—bah!</p>
                     <p>I know the family, living No. 27 Limehouse Road, I respect the gentleman—a
                        fine, burly specimen of your Englishman—and Madame, charming, ravishing,
                        delightful. When it became known to me that they designed to let their
                        delightful residence, and visit foreign shores, I at once called upon them.
                        I kissed the hand of madame. I embraced the great Englishman. Madame blushed
                        slightly. The great Englishman shook my hand like a mastiff.</p>
                     <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6642-00000063"/>
                     <p>I began in that dexterous, insinuating manner, of which I am truly proud. I
                        thought madame was ill. Ah—no. A change, then, was all that was required. I
                        sat down at the piano and sang. In a few minutes madame retired. I was alone
                        with my friend.</p>
                     <p>Seizing his hand, I began with every demonstration of courteous sympathy. I
                        do not repeat my words, for my intention was conveyed more in accent,
                        emphasis, and manner, than speech. I hinted to him that he had another wife
                        living. I suggested that this was balanced—ha!—by his wife's lover. That,
                        possibly, he wished to fly—hence the letting of his delightful mansion. That
                        he regularly and systematically beat his wife in the English manner, and
                        that she repeatedly deceived me. I talked of hope, of consolation, of
                        remedy. I carelessly produced a bottle of strychnine and a small vial of
                        stramonium from my pocket, and enlarged on the efficiency of drugs. His
                        face, which had gradually become convulsed, suddenly became fixed with a
                        frightful expression. He started to his feet, and roared: "You d—d
                        Frenchman!"</p>
                     <p>I instantly changed my tactics, and endeavored to embrace him. He kicked me
                        twice, violently. I begged permission to kiss madame's hand. He replied by
                        throwing me down stairs.</p>
                     <p>I am in bed with my head bound up, and beefsteaks upon my eyes, but still
                        confident and buoyant. I have not lost faith in Macchiavelli. Tra la la! as
                        they sing in the opera. I kiss everybody's hands.</p>

                     <p>MY name is David Diggs. I am a surgeon living at No. 9 Tottenham Court. On
                        the 15th of June, 1854, I was called to see an elderly gentleman lodging on
                        the Kent Road. Found him highly excited, with strong febrile symptoms, pulse
                        120, increasing. Repeated incoherently what I judged to be the popular form
                        of a conundrum. On closer examination found acute hydrocephalus and both
                        lobes of the brain rapidly filling with water. In consultation with an
                        eminent phrenologist, it was further discovered that all the organs were
                        more or less obliterated except that of Comparison. Hence the patient was
                        enabled to only distinguish the most common points of resemblance between
                        objects, without drawing upon other faculties, such as Ideality or Language,
                        for assistance. Later in the day found him sinking—being evidently unable to
                        carry the most ordinary conundrum to a successful issue. Exhibited Tinct.
                        Val., Ext. Opii, and Camphor, and prescribed quiet and emollients. On the
                        17th the patient was missing.</p>

                     <p>ON the 18th of June, Mr. Wilkie Collins left a roll of manuscript with us
                        for publication, without title<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6642-00000064"/> or
                        direction, since which time he has not been heard from. In spite of the care
                        of the proof-readers, and valuable literary assistance, it is feared that
                        the continuity of the story has been destroyed by some accidental misplacing
                        of chapters during its progress. How and what chapters are so misplaced, the
                        publisher leaves to an indulgent public to discover.</p>

                  <p>THE world is divided into two great divisions:<pb n="120"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000065"/> Paris and the provinces. There is but one Paris.
                     There are several provinces, among which may be numbered England, America,
                     Russia, and Italy.</p>
                  <p>N N. was a Parisian.</p>
                  <p>But N N. did not live in Paris. Drop a Parisian in the provinces, and you drop
                     a part of Paris with him. Drop him in Senegambia, and in three days he will
                     give you an <foreign xml:lang="FRA">omelette soufflée</foreign> or a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">pâté de foie gras,</foreign> served by the neatest of
                     Senegambian <foreign xml:lang="FRA">filles,</foreign> whom he will call
                     Mademoiselle. In three weeks he will give you an opera.</p>
                  <p>N N. was not dropped in Senegambia, but in San Francisco—quite as awkward.</p>
                  <p>They find gold in San Francisco, but they don't understand gilding.</p>
                  <p>N N. existed three years in this place. He became bald on the top of his head,
                     as all Parisians do. Look down from your box at the Opera Comique,
                     Mademoiselle, and count the bald crowns of the fast young men in the pit.
                     Ah—you tremble! They show where the arrows of love have struck and glanced
                     off.</p>
                  <p>N N. was also near-sighted, as all Parisians finally become. This is a gallant
                     provision of Nature to spare them the mortification of observing that their
                     lady friends grow old. After a certain age every woman is handsome to a
                     Parisian.</p>
                  <p>One day, N N. was walking down Washington street. Suddenly he stopped.</p>
                  <p>He was standing before the door of a mantua-maker. Beside the counter, at the

                     turned from N N. He entered, With a plausible excuse, and seeming indifference,
                     he gracefully opened conversation with the mantua-maker as only a Parisian can.
                     But he had to deal with a Parisian. His attempts to view the features of the
                     fair stranger by the counter were deftly combated by the shop-woman. He was
                     obliged to retire.</p>
                  <p>N N. went home and lost his appetite. He was haunted by the elegant basque and
                     graceful shoulders of the fair unknown, during the whole night.</p>
                  <p>The next day he sauntered by the mantua-maker. Ah! Heavens! A thrill ran
                     through his frame, and his fingers tingled with a delicious electricity. The
                     fair <foreign xml:lang="FRA">inconnu</foreign> was there! He raised his hat
                     gracefully. He was not certain, but he thought that a slight motion of her
                     faultless bonnet betrayed recognition. He would have wildly darted into the
                     shop, but just then the figure of the mantua-maker appeared in the doorway.</p>
                  <p>—Did Monsieur wish anything?</p>
                  <p>Misfortune! Desperation. N N. purchased a bottle of Prussic acid, a sack of
                     charcoal, and a quire of pink note paper, and returned home. He wrote a letter
                     of farewell to the closely fitting basque, and opened the bottle of Prussic
                     acid.</p>
                  <p>Some one knocked at his door. It was a Chinaman, with his weekly linen.</p>
                  <p>These Chinese are docile, but not intelligent. They are ingenious, but not
                     creative. They are cunning<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6642-00000067"/> in
                     expedients, but deficient in tact. In love they are simply barbarous. They
                     purchase their wives openly, and not constructively by attorney. By offering
                     small sums for their sweethearts, they degrade the value of the sex.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, N N. felt he was saved. He explained all to the faithful
                     Mongolian, and exhibited the letter he had written. He implored him to deliver
                     it.</p>
                  <p>The Mongolian assented. The race are not cleanly or sweet savored, but N N.
                     fell upon his neck. He embraced him with one hand, and closed his nostrils with
                     the other. Through him, he felt he clasped the close-fitting basque.</p>
                  <p>The next day was one of agony and suspense. Evening came, but no Mercy. N N.
                     lit the charcoal. But, to compose his nerves, he closed his door and first
                     walked mildly up and down Montgomery Street. When he returned, he found the
                     faithful Mongolian on the steps.</p>
                  <p>—All lity!</p>
                  <p>These Chinese are not accurate in their pronunciation. They avoid the <hi

                  <p>N N. gasped for breath. He leaned heavily against the Chinaman.</p>
                  <p>—Then you have seen her, Ching Long?</p>
                  <p>—Yes. All lity. She cum. Top side of house.</p>
                  <p>The docile barbarian pointed up the stairs, and chuckled.</p>
                  <p>—She here—impossible! Ah, Heaven! do I dream?</p>
                  <p>—Yes. All lity—top side of house. Good bye John.</p>
                  <p>This is the familiar parting epithet of the Mongolian. It is equivalent to our

                  <p>"N N. gazed with a stupefied air on the departing servant.</p>
                  <p>He placed his hand on his throbbing heart. She here—alone beneath this roof.
                     Oh, Heavens—what happiness!</p>
                  <p>But how? Torn from her home. Ruthlessly dragged, perhaps, from her evening
                     devotions, by the hands of a relentless barbarian. Could she forgive him?</p>
                  <p>He dashed frantically up the stairs. He opened the door. She was standing
                     beside his couch with averted face.</p>
                  <p>A strange giddiness overtook him. He sank upon his knees at the threshold.</p>
                  <p>—Pardon, pardon. My angel, can you forgive me?</p>
                  <p>A terrible nausea now seemed added to the fearful giddiness. His utterance grew
                     thick and sluggish.</p>
                  <p>—Speak, speak, enchantress. Forgiveness is all I ask. My Love, my Life!</p>
                  <p>She did not answer. He staggered to his feet. As he rose, his eyes fell on the
                     pan of burning charcoal. A terrible suspicion flashed across his mind. This
                     giddiness—this nausea. The ignorance of the barbarian. This silence. O merciful
                     heavens! she was dying!</p>

                  <p>He crawled toward her. He touched her. She fell forward with a lifeless sound
                     upon the floor. He uttered a piercing shriek, and threw himself beside her.</p>

                     brutally—these cruel minions of the law—and disengaged his arm from the waist
                     of the wooden dummy which they had come to reclaim for the mantua maker.</p>
                  <p>Emptying a few bucketfuls of water over his form, they finally succeeded in

                     <p>TO be good is to be queer. What is a good man? Bishop Myriel.</p>
                     <p>My friend, you will possibly object to this. You will say you know what a
                        good man is. Perhaps you will say your clergyman is a good man, for
                        instance.</p>
                     <p>Bah! you are mistaken; you are an Englishman, and an Englishman is a
                        beast.</p>
                     <p>Englishmen think they are moral when they are<pb n="126-127"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000069"/> only serious. These Englishmen also wear
                        ill-shaped hats, and dress horribly!</p>
                     <p>Bah! they are <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canaille.</foreign>
                     </p>
                     <p>Still, Bishop Myriel was a good man—quite as good as you. Better than you,
                        in fact.</p>
                     <p>One day M. Myriel was in Paris. This angel used to walk about the streets
                        like any other man. He was not proud, though fine-looking. Well, three
                           <foreign xml:lang="FRA">gamins de Paris</foreign> called him bad names.
                        Says one:</p>
                     <p>"Ah, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mon Dieu!</foreign> there goes a priest; look
                        out for your eggs and chickens!"</p>
                     <p>What did this good man do? He called to them kindly:</p>
                     <p>"My children," said he, "this is clearly not your fault. I recognize in this
                        insult and irreverence only the fault of your immediate progenitors. Let us
                        pray for your immediate progenitors."</p>
                     <p>They knelt down and prayed for their immediate progenitors.</p>
                     <p>The effect was touching.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop looked calmly around:</p>
                     <p>"On reflection," said he, <choice>

                        pray for Society.</p>
                     <p>They knelt down and prayed for Society.</p>
                     <p>The effect was sublimer yet. What do you think of that? You, I mean.</p>
                     <p>Everybody remembers the story of the Bishop and Mother Nez Retroussé. Old
                        Mother Nez Retroussé sold asparagus. She was poor; there's a great deal of
                        meaning in that word, my friend. Some people say "poor but honest;" I say,
                        Bah!</p>
                     <p>Bishop Myriel bought six bunches of asparagus. This good man had one
                        charming failing; he was fond of asparagus. He gave her a <foreign

                     <p>The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sous</foreign> were bad—counterfeit. What did
                        this good Bishop do? He said: "I should not have taken change from a poor
                        woman."</p>
                     <p>Then afterwards, to his housekeeper: "Never take change from a poor
                        woman."</p>
                     <p>Then he added to himself: "For the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sous</foreign>
                        will probably be bad."</p>

                     <p>WHEN a man commits a crime society claps him in prison. A prison is one of
                        the worst hotels imaginable. The people there are low and vulgar. The butter
                        is bad, the coffee is green. Ah, it is horrible!</p>
                     <p>In prison, as in a bad hotel, a man soon loses, not only his morals, but
                        what is much worse to a Frenchman, his sense of refinement and delicacy.</p>
                     <p>Jean Valjean came from prison with confused notions of society. He forgot
                        the modern peculiarities of hospitality. So he walked off with the Bishop's
                        candlesticks.</p>
                     <p>Let us consider: candlesticks were stolen; that was evident. Society put
                        Jean Valjean in prison; that was evident, too. In prison, Society took away
                        his refinement; that is evident, likewise.</p>
                     <p>Who is Society?</p>
                     <p>You and I are Society.</p>
                     <p>My friend, you and I stole those candlesticks!</p>

                     <p>The Bishop thought so, too. He meditated profoundly for six days. On the
                        morning of the seventh he went to the Prefecture of Police.</p>
                     <p>He said: "Monsieur, have me arrested. I have stolen candlesticks."</p>
                     <p>The official was governed by the law of Society, and refused.</p>
                     <p>What did this Bishop do?</p>
                     <p>He had a charming ball and chain made, affixed to his leg, and wore it the
                        rest of his life.</p>

                     <p>LOVE is a mystery.</p>
                     <p>A little friend of mine down in the country, at Auvergne, said to me one
                        day: "Victor, Love is the world—it contains everything."</p>
                     <p>She was only sixteen, this sharp-witted little girl, and a beautiful blonde.
                        She thought everything of me.</p>
                     <p>Fantine was one of those women who do wrong in the most virtuous and
                        touching manner. This is a peculiarity of French grisettes.</p>
                     <p>You are an Englishman, and you don't understand. Learn, my friend, learn.
                        Come to Paris and improve your morals.</p>
                     <p>Fantine was the soul of modesty. She always wore high-neck dresses.
                        High-neck dresses are a sign of modesty.</p>
                     <p>Fantine loved Thomolyes. Why? My God! What are you to do? It was the fault
                        of her parents, and she hadn't any. How shall you teach her? You must teach
                        the parent if you wish to educate the child. How would you become
                        virtuous?</p>

                        gentlemanly manner—Fantine became convinced that a rigid sense of propriety
                        might look upon her conduct as immoral. She was a creature of
                        sensitiveness—and her eyes were opened.</p>
                     <p>She was virtuous still, and resolved to break off the <foreign

                        is the remark of a cautious and discreet writer. He was also sagacious and
                        intelligent.</p>
                     <p>Woman! Look upon her and admire her. Gaze upon her and love her. If she
                        wishes to embrace you, permit her. Remember she is weak and you are
                        strong.</p>
                     <p>But don't treat her unkindly. Don't make love to another woman before her
                        face, even if she be your wife. Don't do it. Always be polite, even should
                        she fancy somebody better than you.</p>
                     <p>If your mother, my dear Amadis, had not fancied your father better than
                        somebody, you might have been that somebody's son. Consider this. Always be
                        a philosopher, even about women.</p>
                     <p>Few men understand women. Frenchmen perhaps better than any one else. I am a

                     <p>She has a mother and father. Let us suppose, for example, they are married.
                        Let us be moral if we cannot be happy and free—they are married—perhaps—they

                     <p>She is not lovely at first. It is cruel, perhaps—but she is red—and
                        positively ugly. She feels this keenly, and cries. She weeps. Ah, my God!
                        how she weeps! Her cries and lamentations now are really distressing.</p>
                     <p>Tears stream from her in floods. She feels deeply and copiously like M.

                        misunderstand her.</p>
                     <p>Yet she has charming natural impulses. See how she tosses her dimpled arms.
                        She looks longingly at her mother. She has a language of her own. She says,
                        "goo goo," and "ga ga."</p>

                     <p>It is a charming and elegant affair. It has pink cheeks and purple-black
                        hair. She prefers brunettes, for she has already, with the quick knowledge
                        of a French infant, perceived she is a blonde and that her doll cannot rival
                        her. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Mon Dieu,</foreign> how touching! Happy child!
                        She spends hours in preparing its toilette. She begins to show her taste in
                        the exquisite details of its dress. She loves it madly, devotedly. She will

                     <p>This is the time the anxious parent will guide these first outpourings. She

                     <p>She had stolen away from her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bonne</foreign> and was

                     <p>They had seated themselves around a pool in the road, and were fashioning
                        fantastic shapes in the clayey soil with their hands. Her throat swelled and
                        her eyes sparkled with delight as, for the first time, her soft palms
                        touched the plastic mud. She made a graceful and lovely pie. She stuffed it
                        with stones for almonds and plums. She forgot everything. It was being baked
                        in the solar rays, when madame came and took her away.</p>

                     <p>She offers to run away with him. He is transported, but magnanimous. He is
                        wearied, perhaps. She sees him the next day offering flowers to the daughter

                     <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p>"WILL you write me up?"</p>
                     <p>The scene was near Temple Bar. The speaker was the famous rebel Mary
                        McGillup—a young girl of fragile frame, and long, lustrous black hair. I
                        must confess that the question was a peculiar one, and under the
                        circumstances, somewhat puzzling. It was true I had been kindly treated by
                        the Northerners, and, though prejudiced against them, was to some extent
                        under obligations to them. It was true that I knew little or nothing of
                        American politics, history, or geography. But when did an English writer
                        ever weigh such trifles? Turning to the speaker, I inquired with some
                        caution the amount of pecuniary compensation offered for the work.</p>
                     <p>"Sir!" she said, drawing her fragile form to its full height, "You insult
                        me—you insult the South."</p>
                     <p>"But look ye here, d'ye see—the tin—the blunt—the ready—the stiff, you know.
                        Don't ye see, we can't do without that, you know!"</p>
                     <p>"It shall be contingent on the success of the story," she answered swered
                        haughtily. "In the meantime take this precious gem." And drawing a diamond
                        ring from her finger, she placed it with a roll of MSS. in my hands and
                        vanished.</p>
                     <p>Although unable to procure more than ¥1 2s. 6d. from an intelligent
                        pawnbroker to whom I stated the circumstances and with whom I pledged the
                        ring, my sympathies with the cause of a down-trodden and chivalrous people
                        were at once enlisted. I could not help wondering that in rich England, the
                        home of the oppressed and the free, a young and lovely woman like the fair
                        author of those pages should be obliged to thus pawn her jewels—her marriage
                        gift—for the means to procure her bread! With the exception of the English
                        aristocracy—who much resemble them—I do not know of a class of people that I
                        so much admire as the Southern planters. May I become better acquainted with
                        both.</p>
                     <p>Since writing the above, the news of Mr. Lincoln's assassination has reached
                        me. It is enough for me to say that I am dissatisfied with the result. I do
                        not attempt to excuse the assassin. Yet there will be men who will charge
                        this act upon the chivalrous South. This leads me to repeat a remark once
                        before made by me in this connection, which has become justly celebrated. It
                        is this:</p>
                     <p>"It is usual, in cases of murder, to look for the criminal among those who
                        expect to be benefited by the crime. In the death of Lincoln, his immediate
                        successor in office alone receives the benefit of his dying.'"</p>
                     <p>If Her Majesty Queen Victoria were assassinated, which Heaven forbid, the
                        one most benefited by her decease would, of course, be His Royal Highness
                        the Prince of Wales, her immediate successor. It would be unnecessary to
                        state that suspicion would at once point to the real culprit, which would of
                        course be His Royal Highness. This is logic.</p>
                     <p>But I have done. After having thus stated my opinion in favor of the South,
                        I would merely remark that there is One who judgeth all things—who weigheth
                        the cause between brother and brother—and awardeth the perfect retribution;
                        and whose ultimate decision, I, as a British subject, have only
                        anticipated.</p>

                     <p>EVERY reader of Belle Boyd's narrative will remember an allusion to a
                        "lovely, fragile looking girl of nineteen," who rivaled Belle Boyd in
                        devotion to the Southern cause, and who, like her, earned the enviable
                        distinction of being a "rebel spy."</p>
                     <p>I am that "fragile" young creature. Although on friendly terms with the late
                        Miss Boyd, now Mrs. Harding, candor compels me to state that nothing but our
                        common politics prevents me from exposing the ungenerous spirit she has
                        displayed in this allusion. To be dismissed in a single paragraph after
                        years of—but I anticipate. To put up with this feeble and forced
                        acknowledgment of services rendered would be a confession of a craven
                        spirit, which, thank God, though "<hi rend="i"/>fragile" and only "<hi

                        myself by naming, claim to have, but I have yet to learn that the race of
                        McGillup ever yet brooked slight or insult. I shall not say that attention
                        in certain quarters seems to have turned <emph>some people's</emph> heads;
                        nor that it would have been more delicate if certain folks had kept quiet on
                        the subject of their courtship, and the rejection of certain offers, when it
                        is known that their forward conduct was all that procured them a husband!

                        own adventures upon record. If they are not equal to those of another
                        individual, it is because though "fragile," my education has taught me to
                        have some consideration for the truth. I am done.</p>

                     <p>I WAS born in Missouri. My dislike for the Northern scum was inherent. This
                        was shown, at an early age, in the extreme distaste I exhibited for
                        Webster's spelling-book—the work of a well-known Eastern Abolitionist. I
                        cannot be too grateful for the consideration shown by my chivalrous father—a
                        gentleman of the old school—who resisted to the last an attempt to introduce
                        Mitchell's Astronomy and Geography into the public school of our district.
                        When I state that this same Mitchell became afterward a hireling helot in
                        the Yankee Army, every intelligent reader will appreciate the prophetic
                        discrimination of this true son of the South.</p>
                     <p>I was eight years old when I struck the first blow for Southern freedom
                        against the Northern Tyrant. It is hardly necessary to state that in this
                        instance the oppressor was a pale, over-worked New England "school-marm."
                        The principle for which I was contending, I felt, however, to be the same.

                         As the English people may like to know what was really the origin of
                        the rebellion, I have no hesitation in giving them the true and only cause.
                        Slavery had nothing to do with it, although the violation of the Declaration
                        of Independence, in the disregard by the North of the Fugitive Slave
                           Law,<ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">†</ref>
                         might have provoked a less fiery people than the Southrons. At the
                        inception of the struggle a large amount of Southern indebtedness was held
                        by the people of the North. To force payment from the generous but insolvent
                        debtor—to obtain liquidation from the Southern planter—was really the
                        soulless and mercenary object of the craven Northerners. Let the common
                        people of England look to this. Let the improvident literary hack; the
                        starved impecunious nious Grub Street debtor; the newspaper frequenter of
                        sponging-houses, remember this in their criticisms of the vile and slavish
                        Yankee.</p>

                     <p>THE roasting of an Abolitionist, by a greatly infuriated community, was my
                        first taste of the horrors of civil war. Heavens! Why will the North persist
                        in this fratricidal warfare? The expulsion of several Union refugees, which
                        soon followed, now fairly plunged my beloved State in the seething
                        vortex.</p>
                     <p>I was sitting at the piano one afternoon, singing that stirring refrain, so
                        justly celebrated, but which a craven spirit, unworthy of England, has
                        excluded from some of her principal restaurants, and was dwelling with some
                        enthusiasm on the following line: <q>
                           <l>"Huzza! she spurns the Northern scum!"</l>
                        </q> when a fragment of that scum, clothed in that detestable blue uniform
                        which is the symbol of oppression, entered the apartment. "I have the honor
                        of addressing the celebrated rebel spy, Miss McGillup," said the Vandal
                        officer.</p>
                     <p>In a moment I was perfectly calm. With the exception of slightly
                        expectorating twice in the face of the minion, I did not betray my
                        agitation. Haughtily, yet firmly, I replied:</p>
                     <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6642-00000078"/>
                     <p>"I am."</p>
                     <p>"You looked as if you might be," the brute replied, as he turned on his heel
                        to leave the apartment.</p>
                     <p>In an instant I threw myself before him. "You shall not leave here thus," I
                        shrieked, grappling him with an energy which no one, seeing my frail figure,
                        would have believed. "I know the reputation of your hireling crew. I read
                        your dreadful purpose in your eye. Tell me not that your designs are not
                        sinister. You came here to insult me—to kiss me, perhaps. You shan't—you
                        naughty man. Go away!"</p>
                     <p>The blush of conscious degradation rose to the cheek of the Lincoln hireling
                        as he turned his face away from mine.</p>
                     <p>In an instant I drew my pistol from my belt, which, in anticipation of some
                        such outrage, I always carried, and shot him.</p>

                        to the camp of Generals Price and Mosby to put them in possession of

                     <p>RELEASED at last from durance vile and placed on board of an Erie canal
                        boat, on my way to Canada, I for a moment breathed the sweets of liberty.
                        Perhaps the interval gave me opportunity to indulge in certain reveries
                        which I had hitherto sternly dismissed. Henry Breckinridge Folair, a
                        consistent copperhead, captain of the canal-boat, again and again pressed
                        that suit I had so often rejected.</p>
                     <p>It was a lovely moonlight night. We sat on the deck of the gliding craft.
                        The moonbeam and the lash of the driver fell softly on the flanks of the
                        off-horse, and only the surging of the tow-rope broke the silence. Folair's
                        arm clasped my waist. I suffered it to remain. Placing in my lap a small but
                        not ungrateful roll of checkerberry lozenges, he took the occasion to repeat
                        softly in my ear the words of a motto he had just unwrapped—with its
                        graceful covering of the tissue paper—from a sugar almond. The heart of the
                        wicked little rebel, Mary McGillup, was won!</p>
                     <p>The story of Mary McGillup is done. I might have added the journal of my
                        husband, Henry Breckinridge Folair, but as it refers chiefly to his
                        freights, and a schedule of his passengers, I have been obliged,
                        reluctantly, to suppress it.</p>
                     <p>It is due to my friends to say that I have been requested not to write this
                        book. Expressions have reached my ears, the reverse of complimentary. I have
                        been told that its publication will probably ensure my banishment for life.
                        Be it so. If the cause for which I labored have been subserved, I am
                        content.</p>

                  <p>AS I glance across my table, I am somewhat distracted by the spectacle of a
                     venerable head whose crown occasionally appears beyond, at about its level. The
                     apparition of a very small hand—whose fingers are bunchy and have the
                     appearance of being slightly webbed—which is frequently lifted above the table
                     in a vain and impotent attempt to reach the inkstand, always affects me as a
                     novelty at each recurrence of the phenomenon. Yet both the venerable head and
                     bunchy fingers belonged to an individual with whom I am familiar, and to whom,
                     for certain reasons hereafter described, I choose to apply the epithet written
                     above this article.</p>
                  <p>His advent in the family was attended with peculiar circumstances. He was
                     received with some concern—the number of retainers having been increased by one
                     in honor of his arrival. He appeared to be weary—his pretence was that he had
                     come from a long journey—so that for days, weeks, and even months, he did not
                     leave his bed except when he was carried. But it was remarkable that his
                     appetite was invariably regular and healthy, and that his meals, which he
                     required should be brought to him, were<pb n="152-153"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000082"/> seldom rejected. During this time he had little
                     conversation with the family, his knowledge of our vernacular being limited,
                     but occasionally spoke to himself in his own language—a foreign tongue. The
                     difficulties attending this eccentricity were obviated by the young woman who
                     had from the first taken him under her protection—being, like the rest of her
                     sex, peculiarly open to impositions—and who at once disorganized her own tongue
                     to suit his. This was effected by the contraction of the syllables of some
                     words, the addition of syllables to others, and an ingenious disregard for
                     tenses and the governing powers of the verb. The same singular law which impels
                     people in conversation with foreigners to imitate their broken English,
                     governed the family in their communications with him. He received these
                     evidences of his power with an indifference not wholly free from scorn. The
                     expression of his eye would occasionally denote that his higher nature revolted
                     from them. I have no doubt myself that his wants were frequently
                     misinterpreted; that the stretching forth of his hands toward the moon and
                     stars might have been the performance of some religious rite peculiar to his
                     own country, which was in ours misconstrued into a desire for physical
                     nourishment. His repetition of the word "goo-goo"—which was subject to a
                     variety of opposite interpretations—when taken in conjunction with his size, in
                     my mind seemed to indicate his aboriginal or Aztec origin.</p>
                  <p>I incline to this belief, as it sustains the impression I have already hinted
                     at, that his extreme youth is a simulation and deceit; that he is really older
                     and has lived before at some remote period, and that his conduct fully
                     justifies his title as A Venerable Impostor. A variety of circumstances
                     corroborate this impression: His tottering walk, which is a senile as well as a
                     juvenile condition; his venerable head, thatched with such imperceptible hair
                     that, at a distance, it looks like a mild aureola, and his imperfect dental
                     exhibition. But beside these physical peculiarities may be observed certain
                     moral symptoms, which go to disprove his assumed youth. He is in the habit of
                     falling into reveries, caused, I have no doubt, by some circumstance which
                     suggests a comparison with his experience in his remoter boyhood, or by some
                     serious retrospection of the past years. He has been detected lying awake, at
                     times when he should have been asleep, engaged in curiously comparing the
                     bed-clothes, walls and furniture with some recollection of his youth. At such
                     moments he has been heard to sing softly to himself fragments of some
                     unintelligible composition, which probably still linger in his memory as the
                     echoes of a music he has long outgrown. He has the habit of receiving strangers
                     with the familiarity of one who had met them before, and to whom their
                     antecedents and peculiarities were matters of old acquaintance, and so unerring
                     is his judgment of their previous character that when he withholds his
                     confidence I am apt to withhold mine. It is somewhat remarkable that while the
                     maturity of his years and the respect due to them is denied by man, his
                     superiority and venerable<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6642-00000083"/> able age
                     is never questioned by the brute creation. The dog treats him with a respect
                     and consideration accorded to none others, and the cat permits a familiarity
                     which I should shudder to attempt. It may be considered an evidence of some
                     Pantheistic quality in his previous education, that he seems to recognize a
                     fellowship even in inarticulate objects; he has been known to verbally address
                     plants, flowers and fruit, and to extend his confidence to such inanimate
                     objects as chairs and tables. There can be little doubt that, in the remote
                     period of his youth, these objects were endowed with not only sentient natures
                     but moral capabilities, and he is still in the habit of beating them when they
                     collide with him, and of pardoning them with a kiss.</p>
                  <p>As he has grown older—rather let me say, as we have approximated to his
                     years—he has, in spite of the apparent paradox, lost much of his senile
                     gravity. It must be confessed that some of his actions of late appear to our
                     imperfect comprehension inconsistent with his extreme age. A habit of marching
                     up and down with a string tied to a soda-water bottle, a disposition to ride
                     anything that could by any exercise of the liveliest fancy be made to assume
                     equine proportions, a propensity to blacken his venerable white hair with ink
                     and coal dust, and an omnivorous appetite which did not stop at chalk, clay, or
                     cinders, were peculiarities not calculated to excite respect. In fact, he would
                     seem to have become demoralized, and when, after a prolonged absence the other
                     day, he was finally discovered standing upon the front steps addressing a group
                     of delighted children out of his limited vocabulary, the circumstance could
                     only be accounted for as the garrulity of age.</p>
                  <p>But I lay aside my pen amidst an ominous silence and the disappearance of the
                     venerable head from my plane of vision. As I step to the other side of the
                     table, I find that sleep has overtaken him in an overt act of hoary wickedness.
                     The very pages I have devoted to an exposition of his deceit he has quietly
                     abstracted, and I find them covered with cabalistic figures and wild-looking
                     hieroglyphs traced with his forefinger dipped in ink, which doubtless in his
                     own language conveys a scathing commentary on my composition. But he sleeps
                     peacefully, and there is something in his face which tells me that he has
                     already wandered away to that dim reign of his youth where I cannot follow him.
                     And as there comes a strange stirring at my heart when I contemplate the
                     immeasurable gulf which lies between us, and how slight and feeble as yet is
                     his grasp on this world and its strange realities, I find too late that I also
                     am a willing victim of the Venerable Impostor.</p>

                  <head>FROM A BALCONY.</head>
                  <p>THE little stone balcony, which, by a popular fallacy, is supposed to be a
                     necessary appurtenance of my window, has long been to me a source of curious
                     interest. The fact that the asperities of our summer weather will not permit me
                     to use it but once or twice in six months, does not alter my concern for this
                     incongruous ornament. It affects me as I suppose the conscious possession of a
                     linen coat or a nankeen trousers might affect a sojourner here who has not
                     entirely outgrown his memory of Eastern summer heat and its glorious
                     compensations—a luxurious providence against a possible but by no means
                     probable contingency. I do no longer wonder at the persistency with which San
                     Franciscans adhere to this architectural superfluity in the face of climatical
                     impossibilities. The balconies in which no one sits, the piazzas on which no
                     one lounges, are timid advances made to a climate whose churlishness we are
                     trying to temper by an ostentation of confidence. Ridiculous as this spectacle
                     is at all seasons, it is never more so than in that bleak interval between
                     sunset and dark, when the shrill scream of the factory whistle seems to have
                     concentrated all the hard unsympathetic quality of the climate into one vocal
                     expression. Add to this the appearance of one or two pedestrians, manifestly
                     too late for their dinners, and tasting in the shrewish air a bitter
                     premonition of the welcome that awaits them at home, and you have one of those
                     ordinary views from my balcony, which makes the balcony itself ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>But as I lean over its balustrade to-night—a night rare in its kindness and
                     beauty—and watch the fiery ashes of my cigar drop into the abysmal darkness
                     below, I am inclined to take back the whole of that preceding paragraph,
                     although it cost me some labor to elaborate its polite malevolence. I can even
                     recognize some melody in the music which comes irregularly and fitfully from
                     the balcony of the Museum on Market Street, although it may be broadly stated
                     that, as a general thing, the music of all museums, menageries, and circuses,
                     becomes greatly demoralized—possibly through associations with the beasts. So
                     soft and courteous is this atmosphere that I have detected the flutter of one
                     or two light dresses on the adjacent balconies and piazzas, and the front
                     parlor windows of a certain aristocratic mansion in the vicinity which have
                     always maintained a studious reserve in regard to the interior, to-night are
                     suddenly thrown into the attitude of familiar disclosure. A few young people
                     are strolling up the street with a lounging step which is quite a relief to
                     that usual brisk, business-like pace which the chilly nights impose<pb
                        n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6642-00000085"/> pose upon even the most sentimental
                     lovers. The genial influences of the air are not restricted to the opening of
                     shutters and front doors; other and more gentle disclosures are made, no doubt,
                     beneath this moonlight. The bonnet and hat which passed beneath my balcony a
                     few moments ago, were suspiciously close together. I argued from this that my
                     friend the editor will probably receive any quantity of verses for his next
                     issue, containing allusions to "Luna," in which the original epithet of
                     "silver," will be applied to this planet, and that a "boon" will be asked for
                     the evident purpose of rhyming with "moon," and for no other. Should neither of
                     the parties be equal to this expression, the pent-up feelings of the heart will
                     probably find vent later in the evening over the piano, in "I wandered by the
                     brookside," or "When the moon on the lake is beaming." But it has been
                     permitted me to hear the fulfillment of my prophecy even as it was uttered.
                     From the window of number Twelve hundred and Seven, gushes upon the slumbrous
                     misty air, the maddening ballad, "Ever of Thee," while at Twelve Hundred and
                     Eleven, the "Star of the Evening" rises with a chorus. I am inclined to think
                     that there is something is the utter vacuity of the refrain in this song, which
                     especially commends itself to the young. The simple statement, "Star of the
                     Evening," is again and again repeated with an imbecile relish; while the
                     adjective "beautiful" recurs with a steady persistency, too exasperating to
                     dwell upon here. At occasional intervals, a bass voice enunciates "Star-r!
                     Star-r!" as a solitary and independent effort. Sitting here in my balcony, I
                     picture the possessor of that voice as a small, stout young man, standing a
                     little apart from the other singers, with his hands behind him. under his
                     coat-tail, and a severe expression of countenance. He sometimes leans forward,
                     with a futile attempt to read the music over somebody else's shoulder, but
                     always resumes his old severity of attitude before singing his part. Meanwhile,
                     the celestial subjects of this choral adoration look down upon the scene with a
                     tranquillity and patience which can only result from the security with which
                     their immeasurable remoteness invests them. I would remark that the stars are
                     not the only topics subject to this "damnable iteration." A certain popular
                     song, which contains the statement, "I will not forget you, mother," apparently
                     reposes all its popularity on the constant and dreary repetition of this
                     unimportant information, which at least produces the desired result among the
                     audience. If the best operatic choruses are not above this weakness, the
                     unfamiliar language in which they are sung offer less violation to common
                     sense.</p>
                  <p>It may be parenthetically stated here that the songs alluded to above may be
                     found in sheet music on the top of the piano of any young lady who has just
                     come from boarding-school. "The Old Arm Chair," or "Woodman, Spare that Tree,"
                     will be also found in easy juxtaposition. The latter songs are usually brought
                     into service at the instance of an uncle or bachelor brother, whose request is
                        generally<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6642-00000086"/> prefaced by a remark
                     deprecatory of the opera, and the gratuitous observation that "we are
                     retrograding, sir—retrograding;" and that "there is no music like the old
                     songs." He sometimes condescends to accompany "Marie" in a tremulous baritone,
                     and is particularly forcible in those passages where the word "repeat" is
                     written, for reasons stated above. When the song is over, to the success of
                     which he feels he has materially contributed, he will inform you that you may
                     talk of your "arias," and your "romanzas," "but for music, sir—music—" at which
                     point he becomes incoherent and unintelligible. It is this gentleman who
                     suggests "China," or "Brattle Street," as a suitable and cheerful exercise for
                     the social circle. There are certain amatory songs, of an arch and coquettish
                     character, familiar to these localities, which the young lady being called upon
                     to sing, declines with a bashful and tantalizing hesitation. Prominent among
                     these may be mentioned an erotic effusion entitled "I'm Talking in my Sleep,"
                     which, when sung by a young person vivaciously and with appropriate glances,
                     can be made to drive languishing swains to the verge of madness. Ballads of
                     this quality afford splendid opportunities for bold young men, who, by
                     ejaculating "Oh" and "Ah" at the affecting passages, frequently gain a
                     fascinating reputation for wildness and skepticism.</p>
                  <p>But the music which called up these parenthetical reflections has died away,
                     and with it the slight animosities it inspired. The last song has been sung,
                     the piano closed, the lights are withdrawn from the windows, and the white
                     skirts flutter away from stoops and balconies. The silence is broken only by
                     the rattle and rumble of carriages coming from theatre and opera. I fancy that
                     this sound—which, seeming to be more distinct at this hour than at any other
                     time, might be called one of the civic voices of the night—has certain urbane
                     suggestions, not unpleasant to those born and bred in large cities. The moon,
                     round and full, gradually usurps the twinkling lights of the city, that one by
                     one seem to fade away and be absorbed in her superior lustre. The distant
                     Mission hills are outlined against the sky, but through one gap the outlying
                     fog which has stealthily invested us, seems to have effected a breach, and only
                     waits the co-operation of the laggard sea breezes to sweep down and take the
                     beleaguered city by assault. An ineffable calm sinks over the landscape. In the
                     magical moonlight the shot-tower loses its angular outline and practical
                     relations, and becomes a minaret from whose balcony an invisible muezzin calls
                     the Faithful to prayer. "Prayer is better than Sleep." But what is this? a
                     shuffle of feet on the pavement, a low hum of voices, a twang of some
                     diabolical instrument, a preliminary hem and cough. Heavens! it cannot be! Ah,
                     yes—it is—it is—SERENADERS!</p>

                     fancies. Destruction and demoralization pursue these pitiable imitators of a
                     barbarous age, when ladies' names and charms were shouted through the land, and
                     modest maidens never lent presence to tilt or tourney without hearing a
                     chronicle of her virtues go round the lists, shouted by wheezy heralds and
                     taken up by roaring swashbucklers. Perdition overpower such ostentatious
                     wooers. Marry! shall I shoot the amorous feline who nightly iterates his love
                     songs on my roof, and yet withhold my trigger finger from yonder pranksome
                     gallant? Go to! Here is an orange left of last week's repast. Decay hath
                     overtaken it—it possesseth neither savor nor cleanliness. Ha! cleverly thrown!
                     A hit—a palpable hit! Peradventure I have still a boot that hath done me
                     service, and, baring a looseness of the heel, an ominous yawning at the side,
                     'tis in good case! Na'theless, 'twill serve. So! so! What! dispersed! Nay,
                     then, I too will retire.</p>

                  <head>MELONS.</head>
                  <p>AS I do not suppose the most gentle of readers will believe that anybody's
                     sponsors in baptism ever willfully assumed the responsibility of such a name, I
                     may as well state that I have reason to infer that Melons was simply the
                     nick-name of a small boy I once knew. If he had any other, I never knew it.</p>
                  <p>Various theories were often projected by me, to account for this strange
                     cognomen. His head, which was covered with a transparent down, like that which
                     clothes very small chickens, plainly permitting the scalp to show through, to
                     an imaginative mind might have suggested that succulent vegetable. That his
                     parents, recognizing some poetical significance in the fruits of the season,
                     might have given this name to an August child, was an Oriental explanation.
                     That from his infancy, he was fond of indulging in melons, seemed on the whole
                     the most likely, particularly as Fancy was not bred in McGinnis's Court. He
                     dawned upon me as melons. His proximity was indicated by shrill, youthful
                     voices, as "Ah, Melons!"—or playfully, "Hi, Melons!" or authoritatively, "You,
                     Melons!"</p>
                  <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6642-00000088"/>
                  <p>McGinnis's Court was a democratic expression of some obstinate and radical
                     property-holder. Occupying a limited space between two fashionable
                     thorough-fares, it refused to conform to circumstances, but sturdily paraded
                     its umkempt glories, and frequently asserted itself in ungrammatical language.
                     My window—a rear room on the ground floor—in this way derived blended light and
                     shadow from the Court. So low was the window-sill, that had I been the least
                     predisposed to somnambulism, it would have broken out under such favorable
                     auspices, and I should have haunted McGinnis's Court. My speculations as to the
                     origin of the Court were not altogether gratuitous, for by means of this window
                     I once saw the Past, as through a glass darkly. It was a Celtic shadow that
                     early one morning obstructed my ancient lights. It seemed to belong to an
                     individual with a pea-coat, a stubby pipe and bristling beard. He was gazing
                     intently at the Court, resting on a heavy cane, somewhat in the way that heroes
                     dramatically visit the scenes of their boyhood. As there was little of
                     architectural beauty in the Court, I came to the conclusion that it was
                     McGinnis looking after his property. The fact that he carefully kicked a broken
                     bottle out of the road, somewhat strengthened me in the opinion. But he
                     presently walked away, and the Court knew him no more. He probably collected
                     his rents by proxy—if he collected them at all.</p>
                  <p>Beyond Melons, of whom all this is purely introductory, there was little to
                     interest the most sanguine and hopeful nature. In common with all such
                     localities, a great deal of washing was done, in comparison with the visible
                     results.—There was always something whisking on the line, and always something
                     whisking through the Court, that looked as if it ought to be there. A fish
                     geranium—of all plants kept for the recreation of mankind, certainly the
                     greatest allusion—straggled under the window. Through its dusty leaves I caught
                     the first glance of Melons.</p>
                  <p>His age was about seven. He looked older, from the venerable whiteness of his
                     head, and it was impossible to conjecture his size, as he always wore clothes
                     apparently belonging to some shapely youth of nineteen. A pair of pantaloons,
                     that, when sustained by a single suspender, completely equipped him—formed his
                     every-day suit. How, with this lavish superfluity of clothing, he managed to
                     perform the surprising gymnastic feats it has been my privilege to witness, I
                     have never been able to tell. His "turning the crab," and other minor
                     dislocations, were always attended with success. It was not an unusual sight at
                     any hour of the day to find Melons suspended on a line, or to see his venerable
                     head appearing above the roofs of the outhouses. Melons knew the exact height
                     of every fence in the vicinity, its facilities for scaling, and the possibility
                     of seizure on the other side. His more peaceful and quieter amusments consisted
                     in dragging a disused boiler by a large string, with hideous outcries, to
                     imaginary fires.</p>
                  <p>Melons was not gregarious in his habits. A few<pb n="166-167"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000089"/> youth of his own age sometimes called upon him,
                     but they eventually became abusive, and their visits were more strictly
                     predatory incursions for old bottles and junk which formed the staple of
                     McGinnis's Court. Overcome by loneliness one day, Melons inveigled a blind
                     harper into the Court. For two hours did that wretched man prosecute his
                     unhallowed calling, unrecompensed, and going round and round the Court,
                     apparently under the impression that it was some other place, while Melons
                     surveyed him <choice>
                        <sic>fron</sic>
                        <corr>from</corr>
                     </choice> an adjoining fence with calm satisfaction. It was this absence of
                     conscientious motives that brought Melons into disrepute with his aristocratic
                     neighbors. Orders were issued that no child of wealthy and pious parentage
                     should play with him. This mandate, as a matter of course, invested Melons with
                     a fascinating interest to them. Admiring glances were cast at Melons from
                     nursery windows. Baby fingers beckoned to him. Invitations to tea (on wood and
                     pewter) were lisped to him from aristocratic back-yards. It was evident he was
                     looked upon as a pure and noble being, untrammeled by the conventionalities of
                     parentage, and physically as well as mentally exalted above them. One afternoon
                     an unusual commotion prevailed in the vicinity of McGinnis's Court. Looking
                     from my window I saw Melons perched on the roof of a stable, pulling up a rope
                     by which one "Tommy," an infant scion of an adjacent and wealthy house, was
                     suspended in mid-air. In vain the female relatives of Tommy, congregated in the
                     back-yard, expostulated with Melons; in vain the unhappy father shook his fist
                     at him. Secure in his position, Melons redoubled his exertions and at last
                     landed Tommy on the roof. Then it was that the humiliating fact was disclosed
                     that Tommy had been acting in collusion with Melons. He grinned delightedly
                     back at his parents, as if "by merit raised to that bad eminence." Long before
                     the ladder arrived that was to succor him, he became the sworn ally of Melons,
                     and I regret to say, incited by the same audacious boy, "chaffed" his own flesh
                     and blood below him. He was eventually taken, though—of course—Melons escaped.
                     But Tommy was restricted to the window after that, and the companionship was
                     limited to "Hi, Melons!" and "You Tommy!" and Melons, to all practical
                     purposes, lost him forever. I looked afterward to see some signs of sorrow on
                     Melon's part, but in vain; he buried his grief, if he had any, somewhere in his
                     one voluminous garment.</p>
                  <p>At about this time my opportunities of knowing Melons became more extended. I
                     was engaged in filling a void in the Literature of the Pacific Coast. As this
                     void was a pretty large one, and as I was informed that the Pacific Coast
                     languished under it, I set apart two hours each day to this work of filling in.
                     It was necessary that I should adopt a methodical system, so I retired from the
                     world and locked myself in my room at a certain hour each day, after coming
                     from my office. I then carefully drew out my portfolio and read what I had
                     written the day before. This would suggest some alteration, and I would
                     carefully re-write it. During this operation I would<pb n="168-169"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000090"/> turn to consult a book of reference, which
                     invariably proved extremely interesting and attractive. It would generally
                     suggest another and better method of "filling in." Turning this method over
                     reflectively in my mind, I would finally commence the new method which I
                     eventually abandoned for the original plan. At this time I would become
                     convinced that my exhausted faculties demanded a cigar. The operation of
                     lighting a cigar usually suggested that a little quiet reflection and
                     meditation would be of service to me, and I always allowed myself to be guided
                     by prudential instincts. Eventually, seated by my window, as before stated,
                     Melons asserted himself. Though our conversation rarely went further than
                     "Hello, Mister!" and "Ah, Melons!" a vagabond instinct we felt in common
                     implied a communion deeper than words. In this spiritual commingling the time
                     passed, often beguiled by gymnastics on the fence or line (always with an eye
                     to my window) until dinner was announced, and I found a more practical void
                     required my attention. An unlooked for incident drew us in closer relation.</p>
                  <p>A sea-faring friend just from a tropical voyage had presented me with a bunch
                     of bananas. They were not quite ripe, and I hung them before my window to
                     mature in the sun of McGinnis's Court, whose forcing qualities were remarkable.
                     In the mysteriously mingled odors of ship and shore which they diffused
                     throughout my room, there was a lingering reminiscence of low latitudes. But
                     even that joy was fleeting and evanescent: they never reached maturity.</p>
                  <p>Coming home one day as I turned the corner of that fashionable thoroughfare
                     before alluded to, I met a small boy eating a banana. There was nothing
                     remarkable in that, but as I neared McGinnis's Court I presently met another
                     small boy, also eating a banana. A third small boy engaged in a like occupation
                     obtruded a painful coincidence upon my mind. I leave the psychological reader
                     to determine the exact co-relation between this circumstance and the sickening
                     sense of loss that overcame me on witnessing it. I reached my room—and found
                     the bunch of bananas were gone.</p>
                  <p>There was but one who knew of their existence, but one who frequented my
                     window, but one capable of the gymnastic effort to procure them, and that was—I
                     blush to say it—Melons. Melons the depredator—Melons, despoiled by larger boys
                     of his ill-gotten booty, or reckless and indiscreetly liberal; Melons—now a
                     fugitive on some neighboring housetop. I lit a cigar and drawing my chair to
                     the window sought <choice>
                        <sic>surcrease</sic>
                        <corr>surcease</corr>
                     </choice> of sorrow in the contemplation of the fish geranium. In a few moments
                     something white passed my window at about the level of the edge. There was no
                     mistaking that hoary head, which now represented to me only aged iniquity. It
                     was Melons, that venerable, juvenile hypocrite.</p>
                  <p>He affected not to observe me, and would have withdrawn quietly, but that
                     horrible fascination which causes the murderer to revisit the scene of his
                     crime, impelled him toward my window. I smoked calmly and gazed at him without
                     speaking. He walked<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6642-00000091"/> several times up
                     and down the Court with a half rigid, half belligerent expression of eye and
                     shoulder, intended to represent the carelessness of innocence.</p>
                  <p>Once or twice he stopped, and putting his arms their whole length into his
                     capacious trowsers, gazed with some interest at the additional width they thus
                     acquired. Then he whistled. The singular conflicting conditions of John Brown's
                     body and soul were at that time beginning to attract the attention of youth,
                     and Melons's performance of that melody was always remarkable. But to-day he
                     whistled falsely and shrilly between his teeth. At last he met my eye. He
                     winced slightly, but recovered himself, and going to the fence, stood for a few
                     moments on his hands, with his bare feet quivering in the air. Then he turned
                     toward me and threw out a conversational preliminary.</p>
                  <p>"They is a cirkis"—said Melons gravely, hanging with his back to the fence and
                     his arms twisted around the palings—"a cirkis over yonder!"—indicating the
                     locality with his foot—" with hosses, and hossback riders. They is a man wot
                     rides six hosses to onct—six hosses to onct—and nary saddle"—and he paused in
                     expectation.</p>
                  <p>Even this equestrian novelty did not affect me. I still kept a fixed gaze on
                     Melons's eye, and he began to tremble and visibly shrink in his capacious
                     garment. Some other desperate means—conversation with Melons was always a
                     desperate means—must be resorted to. He recommenced more artfully.</p>
                  <p>"Do you know Carrots?"</p>
                  <p>I had a faint remembrance of a boy of that euphonious name, with scarlet hair,
                     who was a playmate and persecuter of Melons. But I said nothing.</p>
                  <p>"Carrots is a bad boy. Killed a policeman onct. Wears a dirk knife in his
                     boots, saw him to-day looking in your windy."</p>
                  <p>I felt that this must end here. I rose sternly and addressed Melons.</p>
                  <p>"Melons, this is all irrelevant and impertinent to the case. <emph>You</emph>
                     took those bananas. Your proposition regarding Carrots, even if I were inclined
                     to accept it as credible information, does not alter the material issue. You
                     took those bananas. The offence under the statutes of California is felony. How
                     far Carrots may have been accessory to the fact either before or after, is not
                     my intention at present to discuss. The act is complete. Your present conduct
                     shows the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">animo furandi</foreign> to have been equally
                     clear."</p>
                  <p>By the time I had finished this exordium, Melons had disappeared, as I fully
                     expected.</p>
                  <p>He never re-appeared. The remorse that I have experienced for the part I had
                     taken in what I fear may have resulted in his utter and complete extermination,
                     alas, he may not know, except through these pages. For I have never seen him
                     since. Whether he ran away and went to sea to re-appear at some future day as
                     the most ancient of mariners, or whether he buried himself completely in his
                     trousers, I never shall know. I have read the papers anxiously for<pb
                        n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6642-00000092"/> accounts of him. I have gone to the
                     Police Office in the vain attempt of identifying him as a lost child. But I
                     never saw or heard of him since. Strange fears have sometimes crossed my mind
                     that his venerable appearance may have been actually the result of senility,
                     and that he may have been gathered peacefully to his fathers in a green old
                     age. I have even had doubts of his existence, and have sometimes thought that
                     he was providentially and mysteriously offered to fill the void I have before

                  <head>SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF MASTER CHARLES SUMMERTON.</head>
                  <p>AT exactly half-past nine o'clock on the morning of Saturday, August 26th,
                     1865, Master Charles Summerton, aged five years, disappeared mysteriously from
                     his paternal residence on Folsom Street, San Francisco. At twenty-five minutes
                     past nine he had been observed, by the butcher, amusing himself by going
                     through that popular youthful exercise known as "turning the crab," a feat in
                     which he was singularly proficient. At a court of inquiry summarily held in the
                     back parlor at 10.15, Bridget, cook, deposed to have detected him at twenty
                     minutes past nine, in the felonious abstraction of sugar from the pantry,
                     which, by the same token, had she known what was a-comin', she'd have never
                     previnted. Patsey, a shrill-voiced youth from a neighboring alley, testified to
                     having seen "Chowley," at half past nine, in front of the butcher's shop round
                     the corner, but as this young gentleman chose to throw<pb n="174-175"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000093"/> out the gratuitous belief that the missing child
                     had been converted into sausages by the butcher, his testimony was received
                     with some caution by the female portion of the court, and with downright scorn
                     and contumely by its masculine members. But whatever might have been the hour
                     of his departure, it was certain that from half-past ten A. M. until nine P.
                     M., when he was brought home by a policeman, Charles Summerton was missing.
                     Being naturally of a reticent disposition, he has since resisted, with but one
                     exception, any attempt to wrest from him a statement of his whereabouts during
                     that period. That exception has been myself. He has related to me the following
                     in the strictest confidence:</p>
                  <p>His intention on leaving the door-steps of his dwelling was to proceed without
                     delay to Van Die-man's Land, by way of Second and Market streets. This project
                     was subsequently modified so far as to permit a visit to Otaheite, where Capt.
                     Cook was killed. The outfit for his voyage consisted of two car tickets, five
                     cents in silver, a fishing line, the brass capping of a spool of cotton, which,
                     in his eyes, bore some resemblance to metallic currency, and a Sunday school
                     library ticket. His garments, admirably adapted to the exigencies of any
                     climate, were severally, a straw hat with a pink ribbon, a striped shirt, over
                     which a pair of trousers, uncommonly wide in comparison to their length, were
                     buttoned, striped balmoral stockings, which gave his youthful legs something of
                     the appearance of wintergreen candy, and copper-toed shoes with iron heels,
                     capable ble of striking fire from any flag-stone. This latter quality, Master
                     Charley could not help feeling, would be of infinite service to him in the
                     wilds of Van Die-man's Land, which, as pictorially represented in his
                     geography, seemed to be deficient in corner groceries and matches.</p>
                  <p>Exactly as the clock struck the half hour, the short legs and straw hat of
                     Master Charles Summerton disappeared around the corner. He ran rapidly, partly
                     by way of inuring himself to the fatigues of the journey before him, and partly
                     by way of testing his speed with that of a North Beach car which was proceeding
                     in his direction. The conductor not being aware of this generous and lofty
                     emulation, and being somewhat concerned at the spectacle of a pair of very
                     short, twinkling legs so far in the rear, stopped his car and generally
                     assisted the youthful Summerton upon the platform. From this point a hiatus of
                     several hours' duration occurs in Master Charles's narrative. He is under the
                     impression that he "rode out" not only his two tickets, but that he became
                     subsequently indebted to the company for several trips to and from the opposite
                     termini, and that at last, resolutely refusing to give any explanation of his
                     conduct, he was finally ejected, much to his relief, on a street corner.
                     Although, as he informs us, he felt perfectly satisfied with this arrangement,
                     he was impelled under the circumstances to hurl after the conductor an
                     opprobrious appellation which he had ascertained from Patsey was the correct
                     thing in such emergencies, and possessed peculiarly exasperating
                     properties.</p>
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6642-00000094"/>
                  <p>We now approach a thrilling part of the narrative, before which most of the
                     adventures of the "Boys' Own Book" pale into insignificance. There are times
                     when the recollection of this adventure causes Master Charles to break out in a
                     cold sweat, and he has several times since its occurrence been awakened by
                     lamentations and outcries in the night season by merely dreaming of it. On the
                     corner of the street lay several large empty sugar hogsheads. A few young
                     gentlemen disported themselves therein, armed with sticks, with which they
                     removed the sugar which still adhered to the joints of the staves, and conveyed
                     it to their mouths. Finding a cask not yet pre-empted, Master Charles set to
                     work, and for a few moments reveled in a wild saccharine dream, whence he was
                     finally roused by an angry voice and the rapidly retreating footsteps of his
                     comrades. An ominous sound smote his ear, and the next moment he felt the cask
                     wherein he lay uplifted and set up-right against the wall. He was a prisoner,
                     but as yet undiscovered. Being satisfied in his mind that hanging was the
                     systematic and legalized penalty for the outrage he had committed, he kept down
                     manfully the cry that rose to his lips.</p>
                  <p>In a few moments he felt the cask again lifted by a powerful hand, which
                     appeared above him at the edge of his prison, and which he concluded belonged
                     to the ferocious giant Blunderbore, whose features and limbs he had frequently
                     met in colored pictures. Before he could recover from his astonishment, his
                     cask was placed with several others on a cart, and rapidly driven away. The
                     ride which ensued, he describes as being fearful in the extreme. Rolled around
                     like a pill in a box, the agonies which he suffered may be hinted at not
                     spoken. Evidences of that protracted struggle were visible in his garments,
                     which were of the consistency of syrup, and his hair, which for several hours,
                     under the treatment of hot water, yielded a thin treacle. At length the cart
                     stopped on one of the wharves, and the cartman began to unload. As he tilted
                     over the cask in which Charles lay, an exclamation broke from his lips, and the
                     edge of the cask fell from his hands, sliding its late occupant upon the wharf.
                     To regain his short legs, and to put the greatest possible distance between
                     himself and the cartman, were his first movements on regaining his liberty. He
                     did not stop until he had reached the corner of Front street.</p>
                  <p>Another blank succeeds in this veracious history. He cannot remember how or
                     when he found himself in front of the circus tent. He has an indistinct
                     recollection of having passed through a long street of stores which were all
                     closed, and which made him fear that it was Sunday, and that he had spent a
                     miserable night in the sugar cask. But he remembers hearing the sound of music
                     within the tent, and of creeping on his hands and knees, when no one was
                     looking, until he passed under the canvas. His description of the wonders
                     contained within that circle; of the terrific feats which were performed by a
                     man on a pole, since practised by him in the back yard; of the horses, one of
                     which was spotted and<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6642-00000095"/> resembled an
                     animal in his Noah's Ark, hitherto unrecognized and undefined, of the female
                     equestrians, whose dresses could only be equaled in magnificence to the frocks
                     of his sister's doll, of the painted clown, whose jokes excited a merriment,
                     somewhat tinged by an undefined fear, was an effort of language which this pen
                     could but weakly transcribe, and which no quantity of exclamation points could
                     sufficiently illustrate. He is not quite certain what followed. He remembers
                     that almost immediately on leaving the circus it became dark, and that he fell
                     asleep, waking up at intervals on the corners of the streets, on front steps,
                     in somebody's arms, and finally in his own bed. He was not aware of
                     experiencing any regret for his conduct, he does not recall feeling at any time
                     a disposition to go home—he remembers distinctly that he felt hungry.</p>
                  <p>He has made this disclosure in confidence. He wishes it to be respected. He
                     wants to know if you have five cents about you.</p>

                  <head>SIDEWALKINGS.</head>
                  <p>THE time occupied in walking to and from my business I have always found to
                     yield me a certain mental enjoyment which no other part of the twenty-four
                     hours could give. Perhaps the physical exercise may have acted as a gentle
                     stimulant of the brain, but more probably the comfortable consciousness that I
                     could not reasonably be expected to be doing anything else—to be studying or
                     improving my mind, for instance—always gave a joyous liberty to my fancy. I
                     once thought it necessary to employ this interval in doing sums in
                     arithmetic—in which useful study I was and still am lamentably deficient—but
                     after one or two attempts at peripatetic computation, I gave it up. I am
                     satisfied that much enjoyment is lost to the world by this nervous anxiety to
                     improve our leisure moments, which, like the "shining hours" of Dr. Watts,
                     unfortunately offer the greatest facilities for idle pleasure. I feel a
                     profound pity for those misguided beings who are still impelled to carry
                     text-books with them in cars, omnibuses and ferry-boats, and who generally
                     manage to defraud<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6642-00000096"/> themselves of
                     those intervals of rest they most require. Nature must must have her fallow
                     moments, when she covers her exhausted fields with flowers instead of grain.
                     Deny her this, and the next crop suffers for it. I offer this axiom as some
                     apology for obtruding upon the reader a few of the speculations which have
                     engaged my mind during these daily perambulations.</p>
                  <p>Few Californians know how to lounge gracefully. Business habits and a deference
                     to the custom, even with those who have no business, give an air of restless
                     anxiety to every pedestrian. The exceptions to this rule are apt to go to the
                     other extreme, and wear a defiant, obtrusive kind of indolence which suggests
                     quite as much inward disquiet and unrest. The shiftless lassitude of a gambler
                     can never be mistaken for the lounge of a gentleman. Even the brokers who
                     loiter upon Montgomery Street at high noon are not loungers. Look at them
                     closely and you will see a feverishness and anxiety under the mask of
                     listlessness. They do not lounge—they lie in wait. No surer sign, I imagine, of
                     our peculiar civilization can be found than this lack of repose in its
                     constituent elements. You cannot keep Californians quiet even in their
                     amusements. They dodge in and out of the theatre, opera and lecture-room; they
                     prefer the street cars to walking because they think they get along faster. The
                     difference of locomotion between Broadway, New York, and Montgomery Street, San
                     Francisco, is a comparative view of eastern and western civilization.</p>
                  <p>There is a habit peculiar to many walkers, which <title>Punch,</title> some
                     years ago, touched upon satirically, but which seems to have survived the
                     jester's ridicule. It is that custom of stopping friends in the street, to whom
                     we have nothing whatever to communicate, but whom we embarrass, for no other
                     purpose than simply to show our friendship. Jones meets his friend Smith, whom
                     he has met in nearly the same locality but a few hours before. During that
                     interval, it is highly probable that no event of any importance to Smith, nor
                     indeed to Jones, which by a friendly construction Jones could imagine Smith to
                     be interested in, has occurred, or is likely to occur. Yet both gentlemen stop
                     and shake hands earnestly. "Well, how goes it?" remarks Smith with a vague hope
                     that something may have happened. "So so," replies the eloquent Jones, feeling
                     intuitively the deep vacuity of his friend answering to his own. A pause
                     ensues, in which both gentlemen regard each other with an imbecile smile and a
                     fervent pressure of the hand. Smith draws a long breath and looks up the
                     street; Jones sighs heavily and gazes down the street. Another pause, in which
                     both gentlemen disengage their respective hands and glance anxiously around for
                     some conventional avenue of escape. Finally, Smith (with a sudden assumption of
                     having forgotten an important engagement,) ejaculates, "Well, I must be off,"—a
                     remark instantly echoed by the voluble Jones, and these gentlemen separate,
                     only to repeat their miserable formula the next day. In the above example I
                     have compassionately<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6642-00000097"/> sionately
                     shortened the usual leave-taking, which in skillful hands may be protracted to
                     a length which I shudder to recall. I have sometimes, when an active
                     participant in these atrocious transactions, lingered in the hope of saying
                     something natural to my friend, (feeling that he too was groping in the mazy
                     labyrinths of his mind for a like expression,) until I have felt that we ought
                     to have been separated by a policeman. It is astonishing how far the most
                     wretched joke will go in these emergencies, and how it will, as it were,
                     convulsively detach the two cohering particles. I have laughed (albeit
                     hysterically) at some witticism under cover of which I escaped, that five
                     minutes afterward I could not perceive possessed a grain of humor. I would
                     advise any person who may fall into this pitiable strait, that, next to getting
                     in the way of a passing dray and being forcibly disconnected, a joke is the
                     most efficacious. A foreign phrase often may be tried with success; I have
                     sometimes known <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir</foreign> pronounced
                     "O-reveer," to have the effect (as it ought) of severing friends.</p>
                  <p>But this is a harmless habit compared to a certain reprehensible practice in
                     which sundry feeble-minded young men indulge. I have been stopped in the street
                     and enthusiastically accosted by some fashionable young man who has engaged me
                     in animated conversation, until (quite accidentally) a certain young belle
                     would pass, whom my friend, of course, saluted. As, by a strange coincidence,
                     this occurred several times in the course of the week, and as my young friend's
                     conversational powers invariably flagged after the lady had passed, I am forced
                     to believe that the deceitful young wretch actually used me as a conventional
                     background to display the graces of his figure to the passing fair. When I
                     detected the trick, of course I made a point of keeping my friend, by strategic
                     movements, with his back toward the young lady, while I bowed to her myself.
                     Since then, I understand that it is a regular custom of these callow youths, to
                     encounter each other, with simulated cordiality, some paces in front of the
                     young lady they wish to recognize, so that she cannot possibly cut them. The
                     corner of California and Montgomery Streets is their favorite haunt. They may
                     be easily detected by their furtive expression of eye, which betrays them even
                     in the height of their apparent enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>Speaking of eyes, you can generally settle the average gentility and good
                     breeding of the people you meet in the street by the manner in which they
                     return or evade your glance. "A gentleman," as the Autocrat has wisely said, is
                     always "calm-eyed." There is just enough abstraction in his look to denote his
                     individual power and the capacity for self-contemplation, while he is,
                     nevertheless, quietly and unobtrusively observant. He does not seek, neither
                     does he evade, your observation. Snobs and prigs do the first; bashful and mean
                     people do the second. There are some men who, on meeting your eye, immediately
                     assume an expression quite different from the one which they previously wore,
                     which, whether an improvement<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6642-00000098"/>
                     provement or not, suggests a disagreeable self-consciousness. Perhaps they
                     fancy they are betraying something. There are others who return your look with
                     unnecessary defiance, which suggests a like concealment. The symptoms of the
                     eye are generally borne out in the figure. A man is very apt to betray his
                     character by the manner in which he appropriates his part of the sidewalk. The
                     man who resolutely keeps the middle of the pavement, and deliberately brushes
                     against you, you may be certain would take the last piece of pie at the hotel
                     table, and empty the cream jug on its way to your cup. The man who sidles by
                     you, keeping close to the houses, and selecting the easiest planks, manages to
                     slip through life in some such way, and to evade its sternest duties. The
                     awkward man, who gets in your way, and throws you back upon the man behind you,
                     and so manages to derange the harmonious procession of an entire block, is very
                     apt to do the same thing in political and social economy. The inquisitive man,
                     who deliberately shortens his pace, so that he may participate in the
                     confidence you impart to your companion, has an eye not unfamiliar to keyholes,
                     and probably opens his wife's letters. The loud man, who talks with the
                     intention of being overheard, is the same egotist elsewhere. If there was any
                     justice in Iago's sneer, that there were some "so weak of soul that in their
                     sleep they mutter their affairs," what shall be said of the walking
                     reverie-babblers? I have met men who were evidently rolling over, "like a sweet
                     morsel under the tongue," some speech they were about to make, and others who
                     were framing curses. I remember once that, while walking behind an apparently
                     respectable old gentleman, he suddenly uttered the exclamation, "Well, I'm
                     d—d!" and then quietly resumed his usual manner. Whether he had at that moment
                     become impressed with a truly orthodox disbelief in his ultimate salvation, or
                     whether he was simply indignant, I never could tell.</p>
                  <p>I have been hesitating for some time to speak—or if indeed to speak at all—of
                     that lovely and critic-defying sex, whose bright eyes and voluble prattle have
                     not been without effect in tempering the austerities of my peripatetic musing.
                     I have been humbly thankful that I have been permitted to view their bright
                     dresses and those charming bonnets which seem to have brought the birds and
                     flowers of spring within the dreary limits of the town, and—I trust I shall not
                     be deemed unkind in saying it—my pleasure was not lessened by the reflection
                     that the display, to me at least, was inexpensive. I have walked in—and I fear
                     occasionally on—the train of the loveliest of her sex who has preceded me. If I
                     have sometimes wondered why two young ladies always began to talk vivaciously
                     on the approach of any good-looking fellow; if I have wondered whether the
                     mirror-like qualities of all large show-windows at all influenced their
                     curiosity regarding silks and calicoes; if I have ever entertained the same
                     ungentlemanly thought concerning daguerreotype show cases;<pb n="186-187"

                     has passed between two pretty women—more searching, exhaustive and sincere than
                     any of our feeble ogles; if I have ever committed these or any other
                     impertinences, it was only to retire beaten and discomfitted, and to confess
                     that masculine philosophy, while it soars beyond Sirius and the ring of Saturn,
                     stops short at the steel periphery which encompasses the simplest
                     school-girl.</p>

                  <head>A BOYS' DOG.</head>
                  <p>AS I lift my eyes from the paper, I observe a dog lying on the steps of the
                     opposite house. His attitude might induce passers-by and casual observers to
                     believe him to belong to the people who live there, and to accord to him a
                     certain standing position. I have seen visitors pat him, under the impression
                     that they were doing an act of courtesy to his master—he lending himself to the
                     fraud by hypocritical contortions of the body. But his attitude is one of
                     deceit and simulation. He has neither master nor habitation. He is a very
                     Pariah and outcast; in brief "A Boys' Dog."</p>
                  <p>There is a degree of hopeless and irreclaimable vagabondage expressed in this
                     epithet, which may not be generally understood. Only those who are familiar
                     with the roving nature and predatory instincts of boys in large cities will
                     appreciate its strength. It is the lowest step in the social scale to which a
                     respectable canine can descend. A blind man's dog, or the companion of a
                     knife-grinder, is comparatively elevated. He at least owes allegiance to but
                     one master. But the Boys' Dog is the thrall of an entire<pb n="188-189"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000100"/> juvenile community, obedient to the beck and
                     call of the smallest imp in the neighborhood, attached to and serving not the
                     individual boy so much as the boy element and principle. In their active
                     sports—in small thefts, raids into back-yards, window-breaking and other minor
                     juvenile recreations—he is a full participant. In this way he is the reflection
                     of the wickedness of many masters, without possessing the virtues or
                     peculiarities of any particular one.</p>
                  <p>If leading a "dog's life" be considered a peculiar phase of human misery, the
                     life of a Boys' dog is still more infelicitous. He is associated in all schemes
                     of wrong-doing, and unless he be a dog of experience, is always the scape-goat.
                     He never shares the booty of his associates. In absence of legitimate
                     amusement, he is considered fair game for his companions; and I have seen him
                     reduced to the ignominy of having a tin kettle tied to his tail. His ears and
                     tail have generally been docked to suit the caprice of the unholy band of which
                     he is a member; and if he has any spunk, he is invariably pitted against larger
                     dogs in mortal combat. He is poorly fed and hourly abused; the reputation of
                     his associates debars him from outside sympathies; and once a Boys' dog, he
                     cannot change his condition. He is not unfrequently sold into slavery by his <choice>
                        <sic>inhumam</sic>
                        <corr>inhuman</corr>
                     </choice> companions. I remember once to have been accosted on my own doorsteps
                     by a couple of precocious youths, who offered to sell me a dog which they were
                     then leading by a rope. The price was extremely moderate, being, if I remember
                     rightly, but fifty cents. Imagining the unfortunate animal to have lately
                     fallen into their wicked hands, and anxious to reclaim him from the degradation
                     of becoming a Boys' dog, I was about to conclude the bargain, when I saw a look
                     of intelligence pass between the dog and his two masters. I promptly stopped
                     all negotiation, and drove the youthful swindlers and their four-footed
                     accomplice from my presence. The whole thing was perfectly plain. The dog was
                     an old, experienced, and hardened Boys' dog, and I was perfectly satisfied that
                     he would run away and rejoin his old companions at the first opportunity. This
                     I afterwards learned he did, on the occasion of a kind-hearted but
                     unsophisticated neighbor buying him: and a few days ago I saw him exposed for
                     sale by those two Arcadians, in another neighborhood, having been bought and
                     paid for half-a-dozen times in this.</p>
                  <p>But, it will be asked, if the life of a Boys' dog is so unhappy, why do they
                     enter upon such an unenviable situation, and why do they not dissolve the
                     partnership when it becomes unpleasant? I will confess that I have been often
                     puzzled by this question. For some time I could not make up my mind whether
                     their unholy alliance was the result of the influence of the dog on the boy, or
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vice versa,</foreign> and which was the weakest and
                     most impressible nature. I am satisfied now that, at first, the dog is
                     undoubtedly influenced by the boy, and, as it were, is led, while yet a puppy,
                     from the paths of canine rectitude by artful and designing boys. As he grows
                     older and more<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6642-00000101"/> experienced in the
                     ways of his Bohemian friends, he becomes a willing decoy, and takes delight in
                     leading boyish innocence astray—in beguiling children to play truant, and thus
                     revenges his own degradation on the boy nature generally. It is in this
                     relation, and in regard to certain unhallowed practices I have detected him in,
                     that I deem it proper to expose to parents and guardians the danger to which
                     their offspring are exposed by the Boys' dog.</p>
                  <p>The Boys' dog lays his plans artfully. He begins to influence the youthful mind
                     by suggestions of unrestrained freedom and frolic which he offers in his own
                     person. He will lie in wait at the garden gate for a very small boy, and
                     endeavor to lure him outside its sacred precincts, by gambolling and jumping a
                     little beyond the inclosure. He will set off on an imaginary chase and run
                     around the block in a perfectly frantic manner, and then return, breathless, to
                     his former position, with a look as of one who would say, "There, you see how
                     perfectly easy it's done!" Should the unhappy infant find it difficult to
                     resist the effect which this glimpse of the area of freedom produces, and step
                     beyond the gate, from that moment he is utterly demoralized. The Boys' dog owns
                     him body and soul. Straightway he is led by the deceitful brute into the
                     unhallowed circle of his Bohemian masters. Sometimes the unfortunate boy, if he
                     be very small, turns up eventually at the station-house as a lost child.
                     Whenever I meet a stray boy in the street looking utterly bewildered and
                     astonished, I generally find a Boys' dog lurking on the corner. When I read the
                     advertisments of lost children, I always add mentally to the description, "was
                     last seen in company with a Boys' dog." Nor is his influence wholly confined to
                     small boys. I have seen him waiting patiently for larger boys on the way to
                     school, and by artful and sophistical practices inducing them to play truant. I
                     have seen him lying at the school-house door, with the intention of enticing
                     the children on their way home to distant and remote localities. He has led
                     many an unsuspecting boy to the wharves and quays by assuming the character of
                     a water-dog, which he was not, and again has induced others to go with him on a
                     gunning excursion by pretending to be a sporting dog, in which quality he was
                     knowingly deficient. Unscrupulous, hypocritical and deceitful, he has won many
                     children's hearts by answering to any name they might call him, attaching
                     himself to their persons until they got into trouble, and deserting them at the
                     very moment they most needed his assistance. I have seen him rob small
                     school-boys of their dinners by pretending to knock them down by accident; and
                     have seen larger boys in turn dispossess him of his ill-gotten booty, for their
                     own private gratification. From being a tool, he has grown to be an
                     accomplice—through much imposition he has learned to impose on others—in his
                     best character he is simply a vagabond's vagabond.</p>
                  <p>I could find it in my heart to pity him, as he lies there through the long
                     summer afternoon, enjoying brief intervals of tranquillity and rest which he<pb
                        n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6642-00000102"/> surreptitiously snatches from a
                     stranger's doorstep. For a shrill whistle is heard in the streets, the boys are
                     coming home from school, and he is startled from his dreams by a deftly-thrown
                     potato which hits him on the head, and awakens him to the stern reality that he
                     is now and forever—a Boys' dog.</p>

                  <p>As the new Benevolent Association has had the effect of withdrawing beggars
                     from the streets, and as Professional Mendicancy bids fair to be presently
                     ranked with the Lost Arts, to preserve some records of this noble branch of
                     industry. I have endeavored to recall certain traits and peculiarities of
                     individual members of the order whom I have known, and whose forms I now miss
                     from their accustomed haunts. In so doing, I confess to feeling a certain
                     regret at this decay of Professional Begging, for I hold the theory that
                     mankind are bettered by the occasional spectacle of misery, whether simulated
                     or not, on the same principle that our sympathies are enlarged by the
                     fictitious woes of the Drama, though we know that the actors are insincere.
                     Perhaps I am indiscreet in saying that I have rewarded the artfully dressed and
                     well acted performance of the begging impostor through the same impulse that
                     impelled me to expend a dollar in witnessing the counterfeited sorrows of poor
                     "Triplet," as represented by Charles Wheatleigh. I did not quarrel with deceit
                     in either case.<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6642-00000103"/> My coin was given in
                     recognition of the sentiment; the moral responsibility rested with the
                     performer.</p>
                  <p>The principal figure that I now mourn over as lost forever is one that may have
                     been familiar to many of my readers. It was that of a dark-complexioned,
                     black-eyed, foreign-looking woman, who supported in her arms a sickly baby. As
                     a pathological phenomen on the baby was especially interesting, having
                     presented the Hippocratic face and other symptoms of immediate dissolution,
                     without change for the past three years. The woman never verbally solicited
                     arms. Her appearance was always mute, mysterious and sudden. She made no other
                     appeal than that which the dramatic tableau of herself and baby suggested, with
                     an outstretched hand and deprecating eye sometimes superadded. She usually
                     stood in my doorway, silent and patient, intimating her presence, if my
                     attention were preoccupied, by a slight cough from her baby, whom I shall
                     always believe had its part to play in this little pantomime, and generally
                     obeyed a secret signal from the maternal hand. It was useless for me to refuse
                     alms, to plead business or affect inattention. She never moved; her position
                     was always taken with an appearance of latent capabilities of endurance and
                     experience in waiting which never failed to impress me with awe and the
                     futility of any hope of escape. There was also something in the reproachful
                     expression of her eye, which plainly said to me, as I bent over my paper, "Go
                     on with your mock sentimentalities and simulated pathos; portray the imaginary
                     sufferings of your bodiless creations, spread your thin web of philosophy, but
                     look you, sir, here is real misery! Here is genuine suffering!" I confess that
                     this artful suggestion usually brought me down. In three minutes after she had
                     thus invested the citadel, I usually surrendered at discretion without a gun
                     having been fired on either side. She received my offering and retired as
                     mutely and mysteriously as she had appeared. Perhaps it was well for me that
                     she did not know her strength. I might have been forced, had this terrible
                     woman been conscious of her real power, to have borrowed money which I could
                     not pay, or have forged a check to purchase immunity from her awful presence. I
                     hardly know if I make myself understood, and yet I am unable to define my
                     meaning more clearly when I say that there was something in her glance which
                     suggested to the person appealed to, when in the presence of others, a certain
                     idea of some individual responsibility for her sufferings, which, while it
                     never failed to affect him with a mingled sense of ludicrousness and terror,
                     always made an impression of unqualified gravity on the minds of the
                     bystanders. As she has disappeared within the last month, I imagine that she
                     has found a home at the San Francisco Benevolent Association—at least, I cannot
                     conceive of any charity, however guarded by wholesome checks or sharp-eyed
                     almoners, that could resist that mute apparition. I should like to go there and

                     that it would end in the Association instantly transferring her to my
                     hands.</p>
                  <p>My next familiar mendicant was a vendor of printed ballads. These effusions
                     were so stale, atrocious, and unsalable in their character, that it was easy to
                     detect that hypocrisy, which—in imitation of more ambitious beggary—veiled the
                     real eleemosynary appeal, under the thin pretext of offering an equivalent.
                     This beggar—an aged female in a rusty bonnet—I unconsciously precipitated upon
                     myself in an evil moment. On our first meeting, while distractedly turning over
                     the ballads, I came upon a certain production entitled, I think, "The Fire
                     Zouave," and was struck with the truly patriotic and American manner in which
                     "Zouave" was made to rhyme in different stanzas with "grave, brave, save and
                     glaive." As I purchased it at once, with a gratified expression of countenance,
                     it soon became evident that the act was misconstrued by my poor friend, who,
                     from that moment, never ceased to haunt me. Perhaps, in the whole course of her
                     precarious existence, she had never before sold a ballad. My solitary purchase
                     evidently made me, in her eyes, a customer, and in a measure exalted her
                     vocation; so, thereafter, she regularly used to look in at my door, with a
                     chirping confident air, and the question, "Any more songs to-day?" as though it
                     were some necessary article of daily consumption. I never took any more of her
                     songs, although that circumstance did not shake her faith in my literary taste;
                     my abstinence from this exciting mental pabulum being probably ascribed to
                     charitable motives. She was finally absorbed by the S. F. B. A., who have
                     probably made a proper disposition of her effects. She was a little old woman,
                     of Celtic origin, predisposed to melancholy, and looking as if she had read
                     most of her ballads.</p>
                  <p>My next reminiscence takes the shape of a very seedy individual, who had, for
                     three or four years, been vainly attempting to get back to his relatives in
                     Illinois, where sympathizing friends and a comfortable alms-house awaited him.
                     Only a few dollars, he informed me—the uncontributed remainder of the amount
                     necessary to purchase a steerage ticket—stood in his way. These last few
                     dollars seem to have been most difficult to get—and he had wandered about, a
                     sort of antithetical Flying Dutchman, fore-ever putting to sea, yet never
                     getting away from shore. He was a "49-er," and had recently been blown up in a
                     tunnel, or had fallen down a shaft, I forget which. This sad accident obliged
                     him to use large quantities of whisky as a liniment, which, he informed me,
                     occasioned the mild fragrance which his garments exhaled. Though belonging to
                     the same class, he was not to be confounded with the unfortunate miner who
                     could not get back to his claim without pecuniary assistance, or the desolate
                     Italian, who hopelessly handed you a document in a foreign language, very much
                     bethumbed and illegible—which, in your ignorance of the tongue, you couldn't
                     help suspiciously feeling might have been a price current—but which you could
                     see was proffered as an excuse<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6642-00000105"/> cuse
                     for alms. Indeed, whenever any stranger handed me, without speaking, an open
                     document, which bore the marks of having been carried in the greasy lining of a
                     hat, I always felt safe in giving him a quarter and dismissing him without
                     further questioning. I always noticed that these circular letters, when written
                     in the vernacular, were remarkable for their beautiful caligraphy and
                     grammatical inaccuracy, and that they all seemed to have been written by the
                     same hand. Perhaps indigence exercises a peculiar and equal effect upon the
                     handwriting.</p>
                  <p>I recall a few occasional mendicants whose faces were less familiar. One
                     afternoon a most extraordinary Irishman, with a black eye, a bruised hat, and
                     other traces of past enjoyment, waited upon me with a pitiful story of
                     destitution and want, and concluded by requesting the usual trifle. I replied,
                     with some severity, that if I gave him a dime he would probably spend it for
                     drink. "Be Gorra! but you're roight—I wad that!" he answered promptly. I was so
                     much taken aback by this unexpected exhibition of frankness that I instantly
                     handed over the dime. It seems that Truth had survived the wreck of his other
                     virtues; he did get drunk, and, impelled by a like conscientious sense of duty,
                     exhibited himself to me in that state, a few hours after, to show that my
                     bounty had not been misapplied.</p>
                  <p>In spite of the peculiar characters of these reminiscences, I cannot help
                     feeling a certain regret at the decay of Professional Mendicancy. Perhaps it
                     may be owing to a lingering trace of that youthful superstition stition which
                     saw in all beggars a possible prince or fairy, and invested their calling with
                     a mysterious awe. Perhaps it may be from a belief that there is something in
                     the old-fashioned alms-givings and actual contact with misery, that is
                     wholesome for both donor and recipient, and that any system which interposes a
                     third party between them is only putting on a thick glove, which, while it
                     preserves us from contagion, absorbs and deadens the kindly pressure of our
                     hand. It is a very pleasant thing to purchase relief from annoyance and trouble
                     of having to weigh the claims of an afflicted neighbor. As I turn over these
                     printed tickets, which the courtesy of San Francisco Benevolent Association
                     has—by a slight stretch of the imagination in supposing that any sane
                     unfortunate might rashly seek relief from a newspaper office—conveyed to these
                     editorial hands, I cannot help wondering whether, when in our last extremity we
                     come to draw upon the Immeasurable Bounty, it will be necessary to present a
                     ticket.</p>

                  <head>"SEEING THE STEAMER OFF."</head>
                  <p>I HAVE sometimes thought, while watching the departure of an Eastern steamer,
                     that the act of parting from friends—so generally one of bitterness and
                     despondency—is made by an ingenious Californian custom to yield a pleasurable
                     excitement. This luxury of leave-taking in which most Californians indulge, is
                     often protracted to the hauling in of the gang-plank. Those last words,
                     injunctions, promises, and embraces, which are mournful and depressing perhaps,
                     in that privacy demanded on other occasions, are here, by reason of their very
                     publicity, of an edifying and exhilarating character. A parting kiss blown from
                     the deck of a steamer into a miscellaneous crowd, of course loses much of that
                     sacred solemnity with which foolish superstition is apt to invest it. A
                     broadside of endearing epithets, even when properly aimed and apparently raking
                     the whole wharf, is apt to be impotent and harmless. A husband who prefers to
                     embrace his wife for the last time at the door of her stateroom, and finds
                     himself the centre of an admiring group of unconcerned spectators, of course
                     feels himself lifted above any feeling save that of ludicrousness which the
                     situation suggests. The mother, parting from her offspring, should become a
                     Roman matron under the like influences; the lover who takes leave of his
                     sweetheart, is not apt to mar the general hilarity by any emotional folly. In
                     fact, this system of delaying our parting sentiments until the last moment—this
                     removal of domestic scenery and incident to a public theatre—may be said to be
                     worthy of a stoical and democratic people, and is an event in our lives which
                     may be shared with the humblest coal-passer, or itinerant vendor of oranges. It
                     is a return to that classic out-of-door experience and mingling of public and
                     domestic economy which so ennobled the straight-nosed Athenian.</p>
                  <p>So universal is this desire to be present at the departure of any steamer that,
                     aside from the regular crowd of loungers who make their appearance confessedly
                     only to look on, there are others who take advantage of the slightest intimacy
                     to go through the leave-taking formula. People whom you have quite forgotten,
                     people to whom you have been lately introduced, suddenly and unexpectedly make
                     their appearance and wring your hands with fervor. The friend, long estranged,
                     forgives you nobly at the last moment, to take advantage of this glorious
                     opportunity of "seeing you off." Your bootmaker, tailor, and hatter—haply with
                     no ulterior motives and unaccompanied by official friends—visit you with
                     enthusiasm. You find great difficulty in detaching<pb n="202-203"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000107"/> your relatives and intimates from the trunks on
                     which they resolutely seat themselves, up to the moment when the paddles are
                     moving, and you are haunted continually by an ill-defined idea that they may be
                     carried off, and foisted on you—with the payment of their passage, which, under
                     the circumstances, you could not refuse—for the rest of the voyage.
                     Acquaintances will make their appearance at the most inopportune moments, and
                     from the most unexpected places—dangling from hawsers, climbing up
                     paddle-boxes, and crawling through cabin windows at the imminent peril of their
                     lives. You are nervous and crushed by this added weight of responsibility.
                     Should you be a stranger, you will find any number of people on board, who will
                     cheerfully and at a venture take leave of you on the slightest advances made on
                     your part. A friend of mine assures me that he once parted, with great
                     enthusiasm and cordiality, from a party of gentlemen, to him personally
                     unknown, who had apparently mistaken his state-room. This party—evidently
                     connected with some fire company—on comparing notes on the wharf, being
                     somewhat dissatisfied with the result of their performances, afterward rendered
                     my friend's position on the hurricane deck one of extreme peril and
                     inconvenience, by reason of skillfully projected oranges and apples, not
                     unaccompanied with invective.</p>
                  <p>Yet there is certainly something to interest us in the examination of that
                     cheerless damp closet, whose painted wooden walls no furniture or company can
                     make habitable, wherein our friend is to spend so many vapid days and restless
                     nights. The sight of these apartments, yclept <emph>state-rooms</emph>—Heaven
                     knows why, except it be from their want of coziness—is full of keen
                     reminiscences to most Californians who have not outgrown the memories of that
                     dreary interval when, in obedience to Nature's wise compensations, homesickness
                     was blotted out by seasickness, and both at last resolved into a chaotic and
                     distempered dream, whose details we now recognize. The steamer chair that we
                     used to drag out upon the narrow strip of deck and doze in, over the pages of a
                     well-thumbed novel; the deck itself—of afternoons, redolent with the skins of
                     oranges and bananas—of mornings, damp with salt-water and mopping; the netted
                     bulwark, smelling of tar in the tropics, and fretted on the windward side with
                     little saline crystals: the villainously compounded odors of victuals from the
                     pantry, and oil from the machinery; the young lady that we used to flirt with,
                     and with whom we shared our last novel, adorned with marginal annotation; our
                     own chum; our own bore; the man who was never sea-sick; the two events of the
                     day, breakfast and dinner, and the dreary interval between; the tremendous
                     importance given to trifling events and trifling people; the young lady who
                     kept a journal; the newspaper, published on board, filled with mild
                     pleasantries and impertinences, elsewhere unendurable; the young lady who sang;
                     the wealthy passenger; the popular passenger; the—</p>

                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000108"/> ness, which such associations and some
                     infectious quality of the atmosphere seems to produce, has passed away. What
                     becomes of our steamer friends? Why are we now so apathetic about them? Why is
                     it that we drift away from them so unconcernedly, forgetting even their names
                     and faces? Why, when we do remember them, do we look at them so suspiciously,
                     with an undefined idea that, in the unrestrained freedom of the voyage, they
                     become possessed of some confidence and knowledge of our weaknesses that we
                     never should have imparted? Did we make any such confessions? Perish the
                     thought. The popular man, however, is not now so popular. We have heard finer
                     voices than that of the young lady who sang so sweetly. Our chum's fascinating
                     qualities, somehow, have deteriorated on land; so have those of the fair young
                     novel-reader, now the wife of an honest miner in Virginia City.]</p>
                  <p>—The passenger who made so many trips, and exhibited a reckless familiarity
                     with the officers; the officers themselves, now so modest and undemonstrative,
                     a few hours later so all-powerful and important—these are among the
                     reminiscences of most Californians, and these are to be remembered among the
                     experiences of our friend. Yet he feels as we all do, that his past experience
                     will be of profit to him, and has already the confident air of an old
                     voyager.</p>
                  <p>As you stand on the wharf again, and listen to the cries of itinerant fruit
                     vendors, you wonder why it is that grief at parting and the unpleasant
                     novelties ties of travel are supposed to be assuaged by orange and apples, even
                     at ruinously low prices. Perhaps it may be, figuratively, the last offering of
                     the fruitful earth, as the passenger commits himself to the bosom of the
                     sterile and unproductive ocean. Even while the wheels are moving and the lines
                     are cast off, some hardy apple merchant, mounted on the top of a pile,
                     concludes a trade with a steerage passenger—twenty feet interposing between
                     buyer and seller—and achieves, under these difficulties, the delivery of his
                     wares. Handkerchiefs wave, hurried orders mingle with parting blessings, and
                     the steamer is "off." As you turn your face cityward, and glance hurriedly
                     around at the retreating crowd, you will see a reflection of your own wistful
                     face in theirs, and read the solution of one of the problems which perplex the
                     California enthusiast. Before you lies San Francisco, with her hard angular
                     outlines, her brisk, invigorating breezes, her bright, but unsympathetic
                     sunshine, her restless and energetic population; behind you fades the
                     recollection of changeful but honest skies; of extremes of heat and cold,
                     modified and made enjoyable through social and physical laws, of pastoral
                     landscapes, of accessible Nature in her kindliest forms, of inherited virtues,
                     of long-tested customs and habits, of old friends and old faces—of HOME!</p>

                     <p>A BAY WINDOW once settled the choice of my house and compensated for many of
                        its inconveniences. When the chimney smoked, or the doors alternately shrunk
                        and swelled, resisting any forcible attempt to open them, or opening of
                        themselves with ghostly deliberation, or when suspicious blotches appeared
                        on the ceiling in rainy weather, there was always the bay window to turn to
                        for comfort. And the view was a fine one. Alcatraz, Lime Point, Fort Point
                        and Saucelito were plainly visible over a restless expanse of water that
                        changed continually, glittering in the sunlight, darkening in rocky shadow,
                        or sweeping in mimic waves on a miniature beach below.</p>
                     <p>Although at first the bay window was supposed to be sacred to myself and my
                        writing materials, in obedience to some organic law, it by-and-bye became a
                        general lounging-place. A rocking-chair and crochet-basket one day found
                        their way there. Then the baby invaded its recesses, fortifying himself
                        behind intrenchments of colored worsteds and spools of cotton, from which he
                        was only dislodged by concerted assault, and carried lamenting into
                        captivity. A subtle glamour crept over all who came within its influence. To
                        apply oneself to serious work there was an absurdity. An incoming ship, a
                        gleam on the water, a cloud lingering about Tamaulipas, were enough to
                        distract the attention. Reading or writing, the bay window was always
                        showing something to be looked at. Unfortunately, these views were not
                        always pleasant, but the window gave equal prominence and importance to all,
                        without respect to quality.</p>
                     <p>The landscape in the vicinity was unimproved, but not rural. The adjacent
                        lots had apparently just given up bearing scrub-oaks, but had not seriously
                        taken to bricks and mortar. In one direction the vista was closed by the
                        Home of the Inebriates, not in itself a cheerful-looking, building, and, as
                        the apparent terminus of a ramble in a certain direction, having all the
                        effect of a moral lesson. To a certain extent, however, this building was an
                        imposition. The enthusiastic members of my family, who confidently expected
                        to see its inmates hilariously disporting themselves at its windows in the
                        different stages of inebriation portrayed by the late W. E. Burton were much
                        disappointed. The Home was reticent of its secrets. The County Hospital,
                        also in range of the bay window, showed much more animation. At certain
                        hours of the day convalescents passed in review<pb n="208-209"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000110"/> view before the window on their way to an
                        airing. This spectacle was the still more depressing from a singular lack of
                        sociability that appeared to prevail among them. Each man was encompassed by
                        the impenetrable atmosphere of his own peculiar suffering. They did not talk
                        or walk together. From the window I have seen half a dozen sunning
                        themselves against a wall within a few feet of each other, to all appearance
                        utterly oblivious of the fact. Had they but quarreled or fought—anything
                        would have been better than this horrible apathy.</p>
                     <p>The lower end of the street on which the bay window was situate, opened
                        invitingly from a popular thoroughfare; and after beckoning the unwary
                        stranger into its recesses, ended unexpectedly at a frightful precipice. On
                        Sundays, when the travel North-Beachwards was considerable, the bay window
                        delighted in the spectacle afforded by unhappy pedestrians who were seduced
                        into taking this street as a short cut somewhere else. It was amusing to
                        notice how these people invariably, on coming to the precipice, glanced
                        upward to the bay window and endeavored to assume a careless air before they
                        retraced their steps, whistling ostentatiously, as if they had previously
                        known all about it. One high-spirited young man in particular, being incited
                        thereto by a pair of mischievous bright eyes in an opposite window, actually
                        descended this fearful precipice rather than return, to the great peril of
                        life and limb, and manifest injury to his Sunday clothes.</p>
                     <p>Dogs, goats and horses constituted the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >fauna</foreign> of our neighborhood. Possessing the lawless freedom of
                        their normal condition, they still evinced a tender attachment to man and
                        his habitations. Spirited steeds got up <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                           >extempore</foreign> races on the sidewalks, turning the street into a
                        miniature <hi rend="i"/>Corso; dogs wrangled in the areas; while from the
                        hill beside the house a goat browsed peacefully upon my wife's geraniums in
                        the flower-pots of the second-story window. "We had a fine hail-storm last
                        night," remarked a newly-arrived neighbor, who had just moved into the
                        adjoining house. It would have been a pity to set him right, as he was quite
                        enthusiastic about the view and the general sanitary qualifications of the
                        locality. So I didn't tell him anything about the goats who were in the
                        habit of using his house as a stepping stone to the adjoining hill.</p>
                     <p>But the locality was remarkably healthy. People who fell down the
                        embankments found their wounds heal rapidly in the steady sea breeze.
                        Ventilation was complete and thorough. The opening of the bay window
                        produced a current of wholesome air which effectually removed all noxious
                        exhalations, together with the curtains, the hinges of the back door, and
                        the window shutters. Owing to this peculiarity, some of my writings acquired
                        an extensive circulation and publicity in the neighborhood, which years in
                        another locality might not have produced. Several articles of wearing
                        apparel, which were mysteriously transposed from our clothes-line to that of
                        an humble though honest neighbor, was undoubtedly the result of these
                        sanitary winds. Yet in spite of these advantages I found it convenient in a
                           few<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6642-00000111"/> months to move. And the
                        result whereof I shall communicate in other papers.</p>

                     <p>"A HOUSE with a fine garden and extensive shrubbery, in a genteel
                        neighborhood," were, if I remember rightly, the general terms of an
                        advertisement which once decided my choice of a dwelling. I should add that
                        this occurred at an early stage of my household experience, when I placed a
                        trustful reliance in advertisements. I have since learned that the most
                        truthful people are apt to indulge a slight vein of exaggeration in
                        describing their own possessions, as though the mere circumstance of going
                        into print were an excuse for a certain kind of mendacity. But I did not
                        fully awaken to this fact until a much later period, when, in answering an
                        advertisement which described a highly advantageous tenement, I was referred
                        to the house I then occupied, and from which a thousand inconveniences were
                        impelling me to move.</p>
                     <p>The "fine garden" alluded to was not large, but contained several
                        peculiarly-shaped flower beds. I was at first struck with the singular
                        resemblance which they bore to the mutton-chops that are usually brought on
                        the table at hotels and restaurants—a resemblance the more striking from the
                        sprigs of parsley which they produced freely. One plat in particular
                        reminded me, not unpleasantly, of a peculiar cake, known to my boyhood as a
                        bolivar. The owner of the property, however, who seemed to be a man of
                        original æsthetic ideas, had banked up one of these beds with bright-colored
                        sea-shells, so that in rainy weather it suggested an aquarium, and offered
                        the elements of botanical and conchological study in pleasing juxtaposition.
                        I have since thought that the fish geraniums, which it also bore to a
                        surprising extent, were introduced originally from some such idea of
                        consistency. But it was very pleasant, after dinner, to ramble up and down
                        the gravelly paths, (whose occasional boulders reminded me of the dry bed of
                        a somewhat circuitous mining stream,) smoking a cigar, or inhaling the rich
                        aroma of fennel, or occasionally stopping to pluck one of the hollyhocks
                        with which the garden abounded. The prolific qualities of this plant alarmed
                        us greatly, for although, in the first transport of enthusiasm, my wife
                        planted several different kinds of flower seeds, nothing ever came up but
                        hollyhocks; and although, impelled by the same laudable impulse. I procured
                        a copy of <title>Downing's Landscape Gardening</title>, and a few gardening
                        tools, and worked for several hours in the garden, my efforts were equally
                        futile.</p>
                     <p>The extensive shrubbery consisted of several dwarfed trees. One was very
                        weak young weeping willow, so very limp and maudlin, and so evidently bent
                        on establishing its reputation, that it had to be tied up against the house
                        for support. The dampness of that portion of the house was usually
                        attributed to the presence of this lachrymose shrub. And to these a couple
                        of highly objectionable trees, known, I think, by the name of <hi rend="i"
                        />Malva, which made an inordinate<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6642-00000112"/>
                        dinate show of cheap blossoms that they were continually shedding, and one
                        or two dwarf oaks, with scaly leaves and a generally spiteful exterior, and
                        you have what was not inaptly termed by one Milesian handmaid "the
                        scrubbery."</p>
                     <p>The gentility of our neighbor suffered a blight from the unwholesome
                        vicinity of McGinnis Court. This court was a kind of <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                           >cul de sac</foreign> that, on being penetrated, discovered a primitive
                        people living in a state of barbarous freedom, and apparently spending the
                        greater portion of their lives on their own door-steps. Many of those
                        details of the toilette which a popular prejudice restricts to the
                        dressing-room in other localities, were here performed in the open court
                        without fear and without reproach. Early in the week the court was hid in a
                        choking, soapy mist, which arose from innumerable wash-tubs. This was
                        followed in a day or two later by an extraordinary exhibition of wearing
                        apparel of divers colors, fluttering on lines like a display of bunting on
                        ship-board, and whose flapping in the breeze was like irregular discharges
                        of musketry. It was evident also that the court exercised a demoralizing
                        influence over the whole neighborhood. A sanguine property-owner once put up
                        a handsome dwelling on the corner of our street, and lived therein; but
                        although he appeared frequently an his balcony, clad in a bright crimson
                        dressing-gown, which made him look like a tropical bird of some rare and
                        gorgeous species, he failed to woo any kindred dressing-gown to the
                        vicinity, and only provoked opprobrious epithets from the <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">gamins</foreign> of the court. He moved away shortly
                        after, and on going by the house one day, I noticed a bill of "Rooms to let,
                        with board," posted conspicuously on the Corinthian columns of the porch.
                        McGinnis Court had triumphed. An interchange of civilities at once took
                        place between the court and the servants' area of the palatial mansion, and
                        some of the young men boarders exchange playful slang with the adolescent
                        members of the court. From that moment we felt that our claims to gentility
                        were forever abandoned.</p>
                     <p>Yet, we enjoyed intervals of unalloyed contentment. When the twilight toned
                        down the hard outlines of the oaks, and made shadowy clumps and formless
                        masses of other bushes, it was quite romantic to sit by the window and
                        inhale the faint, sad odor of the fennel in the walks below. Perhaps this
                        economical pleasure was much enhanced by a picture in my memory, whose faded
                        colors the odor of this humble plant never failed to restore. So I often sat
                        there of evenings and closed my eyes until the forms and benches of a
                        country school-room came back to me, redolent with the incense of fennel
                        covertly stowed away in my desk, and gazed again in silent rapture on the
                        round, red cheeks and long black braids of that peerless creature whose
                        glance had often caused my cheeks to glow over the preternatural collar,
                        which at that period of my boyhood it was my pride and privilege to wear. As
                        I fear I may be often thought hypercritical and censorious in these
                        articles, I am willing to record this as one of the advantages<pb
                           n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6642-00000113"/> vantages of our new house, not
                        mentioned in the advertisement nor chargeable in the rent. May the present
                        tenant, who is a stock-broker, and who impresses me with the idea of having
                        always been called "Mr." from his cradle up, enjoy this advantage, and try
                        sometimes to remember he was a boy!</p>

                     <p>SOON after I moved into Happy Valley I was struck with the remarkable
                        infelicity of its title. Generous as Californians are in the use of
                        adjectives, this passed into the domain of irony. But I was inclined to
                        think it sincere—the production of a weak but gushing mind, just as the
                        feminine nomenclature of streets in the vicinity was evidently bestowed by
                        one in habitual communion with "Friendship's Gifts" and "Affection's
                        Offerings."</p>
                     <p>Our house on Laura Matilda Street looked somewhat like a toy Swiss Cottage—a
                        style of architecture so prevalent, that in walking down the block it was
                        quite difficult to resist an impression of fresh glue and pine shavings. The
                        few shade trees might have belonged originally to those oval Christmas boxes
                        which contain toy villages; and even the people who sat by the windows had a
                        stiffness that made them appear surprisingly unreal and artificial. A little
                        dog belonging to a neighbor was known to the members of my household by the
                        name of "Glass," from the general suggestion he gave of having been spun of
                        that article. Perhaps I have somewhat exaggerated these illustrations of the
                        dapper nicety of our neighborhood—a neatness and conciseness which I think
                        has a general tendency to belittle, dwarf and contract their objects. For we
                        gradually fell into small ways and narrow ideas, and to some extent squared
                        the round world outside to the correct angles of Laura Matilda Street.</p>
                     <p>One reason for this insincere quality may have been the fact that the very
                        foundations of our neighborhood were artificial. Laura Matilda Street was
                        "made ground." The land, not yet quite reclaimed, was continually struggling
                        with its old enemy. We had not been long in our new home before we found an
                        older tenant, not yet wholly divested of his rights, who sometimes showed
                        himself in clammy perspiration on the basement walls, whose damp breath
                        chilled our dining-room, and in the night struck a mortal chilliness through
                        the house. There were no patent fastenings that could keep him out—no writ
                        of unlawful detainer that could eject him. In the winter his presence was
                        quite palpable; he sapped the roots of the trees, he gurgled under the
                        kitchen floor, he wrought an unwholesome greenness on the side of the
                        verandah. In summer he became invisible, but still exercised a familiar
                        influence over the locality. He planted little stitches in the small of the
                        back, sought out old aches and weak joints, and sportively punched the
                        tenants of the Swiss Cottage under the ribs. He inveigled little children to
                        play with him, but his plays generally ended in<pb n="216-217"
                           xml:id="VAC6642-00000114"/> scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough,
                        and measles. He sometimes followed strong men about until they sickened
                        suddenly and took to their beds. But he kept the green-plants in good order,
                        and was very fond of verdure, bestowing it even upon lath and plaster and
                        soulless stone. He was generally invisible, as I have said; but some time
                        after I had moved, I saw him one morning from the hill, stretching his grey
                        wings over the valley, like some fabulous vampire, who had spent the night
                        sucking the wholesome juices of the sleepers below, and was sluggish from
                        the effects of his repast. It was then that I recognized him as Malaria, and
                        knew his abode to be the dread Valley of the shadow of Miasma—miscalled the
                        Happy Valley!</p>
                     <p>On week days there was a pleasant melody of boiler-making from the
                        foundries, and the gas works in the vicinity sometimes lent a mild perfume
                        to the breeze. Our street was usually quiet, however—a foot-ball being
                        sufficient to draw the inhabitants to their front windows, and to oblige an
                        incautious trespasser to run the gauntlet of batteries of blue and black
                        eyes on either side of the way. A carriage passing through it communicated a
                        singular thrill to the floors, and caused the china on the dining-table to
                        rattle. Although we were comparatively free from the prevailing winds,
                        wandering gusts sometimes got bewildered and strayed unconsciously into our
                        street, and finding an unencumbered field, incontinently set up a shriek of
                        joy and went gleefully to work on the clothes-lines and chimney-pots, and
                        had a good time generally until they were quite exhausted. I have a very
                        vivid picture in my memory of an organ-grinder who was at one time blown
                        into the end of our street, and actually blown through it in spite of
                        several ineffectual efforts to come to a stand before the different
                        dwellings, but who was finally whirled out of the other extremity, still
                        playing and vainly endeavoring to pursue his unhallowed calling. But these
                        were noteworthy exceptions to the calm and even tenor of our life.</p>
                     <p>There was contiguity but not much sociability in our neighborhood. From my
                        bed-room window I could plainly distinguish the peculiar kind of victuals
                        spread on my neighbor's dining table; while, on the other hand, he obtained
                        an equally uninterrupted view of the mysteries of my toilette. Still that
                        "low vice, curiosity," was regulated by certain laws, and a kind of rude
                        chivalry invested our observations. A pretty girl, whose bed-room window was
                        the cynosure of neighboring eyes, was once brought under the focus of an
                        opera glass in the hands of one of our ingenious youth; but this act met
                        such prompt and universal condemnation as an unmanly advantage, from the
                        lips of married men and bachelors who didn't own opera glasses, that it was
                        never repeated.</p>
                     <p>With this brief sketch I conclude my record of the neighborhoods I have
                        moved from. I have moved from many others since then, but they have
                        generally presented features not dissimilar to the three I have endeavored
                        to describe in these pages.<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6642-00000115"/> I
                        offer them as types containing the salient pecularities of all. Let no
                        inconsiderate reader rashly move on account of them. My experience has not
                        been cheaply bought. From the nettle Change I have tried to pluck the flower
                        Security. Draymen have grown rich at my expense. House-agents have known me
                        and were glad, and landlords have risen up to meet me from afar. The force
                        of habit impels me still to consult all the bills I see in the streets, nor
                        can the war telegrams divert my first attention from the advertising columns
                        of the daily papers. I repeat, let no man think I have disclosed the
                        weaknesses of the neighborhood, nor rashly open that closet which contains
                        the secret skeleton of his dwelling. My carpets have been altered to fit all
                        sized odd shaped apartments from parallelopiped to hexagons. Much of my
                        furniture has been distributed among my former dwellings. These limbs have
                        stretched upon uncarpeted floors, or have been let down suddenly from
                        imperfectly-established bedsteads. I have dined in the parlor and slept in
                        the back kitchen. Yet the result of these sacrifices and trials may be
                        briefly summed up in the statement that I am now on the eve of removal from
                        my PRESENT NEIGHBORHOOD.</p>

                  <head>MY SUBURBAN RESIDENCE.</head>
                  <p>I LIVE in the suburbs. My residence, to quote the pleasing fiction of the
                     advertisement, "is within fifteen minutes' walk of the City Hall." Why the City
                     Hall should be considered as an eligible terminus of anybody's walk, under any
                     circumstances, I have not been able to determine. Never having walked from my
                     residence to that place, I am unable to verify the assertion, though I may
                     state as a purely abstract and separate proposition, that it takes me the
                     better part of an hour to reach Montgomery street.</p>
                  <p>My selection of locality was a compromise between my wife's desire to go into
                     the country, and my own predilections for civic habitation. Like most
                     compromises, it ended in retaining the objectionable features of both
                     propositions—I procured the inconveniences of the country without losing the
                     discomforts of the city. I increased my distance from the butcher and
                     green-grocer, without approximating to herds and kitchen-gardens. But I
                     anticipate.</p>
                  <p>Fresh air was to be the principal thing sought for.<pb n="220-221"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000116"/> That there might be too much of this did not
                     enter into my calculations. The first day I entered my residence, it blew. The
                     second day was windy. The third, fresh, with a strong breeze stirring. On the
                     fourth, it blew; on the fifth, there was a gale, which has continued to the
                     present writing.</p>
                  <p>That the air is fresh, the above statement sufficiently establishes. That it is
                     bracing, I argue from the fact that I find it impossible to open the shutters
                     on the windward side of the house. That it is healthy, I am also convinced,
                     believing that there is no other force in Nature that could so buffet and
                     ill-use a person without serious injury to him. Let me offer an instance. The
                     path to my door crosses a slight eminence. The unconscious visitor, a little
                     exhausted by the ascent and the general effects of the gentle gales which he
                     has faced in approaching my hospitable mansion, relaxes his efforts, smoothes
                     his brow, and approaches with a fascinating smile. Rash and too confident man!
                     The wind delivers a succession of rapid blows, and he is thrown back. He
                     staggers up again—in the language of the P. R., "smiling and confident." The
                     wind now makes for a vulnerable point, and gets his hat in chancery. All
                     ceremony is now thrown away—the luckless wretch seizes his hat with both hands,
                     and charges madly at the front door. Inch by inch, the wind contests the
                     ground; another struggle, and he stands upon the verandah. On such occasions I
                     make it a point to open the door myself, with a calmness and serenity that
                     shall offer a marked contrast to his feverish, and excited air—that shall throw
                     suspicion of inebriety upon him. If he be inclined to timidity and bashfulness,
                     during the best of the evening he is all too-conscious of the disarrangement of
                     his hair and cravat. If he is less sensitive, the result is often more
                     distressing. A valued elderly friend once called upon me after undergoing a
                     two-fold struggle with the wind and a large Newfoundland dog, (which I keep for
                     reasons hereinafter stated,) and not only his hat, but his wig, had suffered.
                     He spent the evening with me, totally unconscious of the fact that his hair
                     presented the singular spectacle of having been parted diagonally from the
                     right temple to the left ear. When ladies called, my wife preferred to receive
                     them. They were generally hysterical, and often in tears. I remember, one
                     Sunday, to have been startled by what appeared to be the balloon from Hayes
                     Valley drifting rapidly past my conservatory, closely followed by the
                     Newfoundland dog. I rushed to the front door, but was anticipated by my wife. A
                     strange lady appeared at lunch, but the phenomenon remained otherwise
                     unaccounted for. Egress from my residence is much more easy. My guests seldom
                     "stand upon the order of their going, but go at once;" the Newfoundland dog
                     playfully harrassing their rear. I was standing one day, with my hand on the
                     open hall door, in serious conversation with the minister of the parish, when
                     the back door was cautiously opened. The watchful breeze seized the
                     opportunity, and charged through the defenceless passage. The front door closed
                     violently in the middle<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6642-00000117"/> dle of a
                     sentence, precipitating the reverend gentleman into the garden. The
                     Newfoundland dog, with that sagacity for which his race is so distinguished, at
                     once concluded that a personal collision had taken place between myself and
                     visitor, and flew to my defence. The reverend gentleman never called again.</p>
                  <p>The Newfoundland dog above alluded to was part of a system of protection which
                     my suburban home once required. Robberies were frequent in the neighborhood,
                     and my only fowl fell a victim to the spoiler's art. One night I awoke, and
                     found a man in my room. With singular delicacy and respect for the feelings of
                     others, he had been careful not to awaken any of the sleepers, and retired upon
                     my rising, without waiting for any suggestion. Touched by his delicacy, I
                     forebore giving the alarm until after he had made good his retreat. I then
                     wanted to go after a policeman, but my wife remonstrated, as this would leave
                     the house exposed. Remembering the gentlemanly conduct of the burglar, I
                     suggested the plan of following him and requesting him to give the alarm as he
                     went in town. But this proposition was received with equal disfavor. The next
                     day I procured a dog and a revolver. The former went off—but the latter
                     wouldn't. I then got a new dog and chained him, and a duelling pistol, with a
                     hair-trigger. The result was so far satisfactory that neither could be
                     approached with safety, and for some time I left them out, indifferently,
                     during the night. But the chain one day gave way, and the dog, evidently having
                     no other attachment to the house, took the opportunity to leave. His place was
                     soon filled by the Newfoundland, whose fidelity and sagacity I have just
                     recorded.</p>
                  <p>Space is one of the desirable features of my suburban residence. I do not know
                     the number of acres the grounds contain except from the inordinate quantity of
                     hose required for irrigating. I perform daily, like some gentle shepherd, upon
                     a quarter-inch pipe without any visible result, and have had serious thoughts
                     of contracting with some disbanded fire company for their hose and equipments.
                     It is quite a walk to the wood-house. Every day some new feature of the grounds
                     is discovered. My youngest boy was one day missing for several hours. His
                     head—a peculiarly venerable and striking object—was at last discovered just
                     above the grass, at some distance from the house. On examination he was found
                     comfortably seated in a disused drain, in company with a silver spoon and a
                     dead rat. On being removed from this locality he howled dismally and refused to
                     be comforted.</p>
                  <p>The view from my suburban residence is fine. Lone Mountain, with its white
                     obelisks, is a suggestive if not cheering termination of the vista in one
                     direction, while the old receiving vault of Yerba Buena Cemetery limits the
                     view in another. Most of the funerals which take place pass my house. My
                     children, with the charming imitativeness that belongs to youth, have caught
                     the spirit of these passing corteges, and reproduce in the back yard, with
                     creditable skill, the salient features of the lugubrious<pb n="224-225"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000118"/> procession. A doll, from whose features all
                     traces of vitality and expression have been removed, represents the deceased.
                     Yet unfortunately I have been obliged to promise them more active participation
                     in this ceremony at some future time, and I fear that they look anxiously
                     forward with the glowing impatience of youth to the <choice>

                        <corr>speedy</corr>
                     </choice> removal of some of my circle of friends. I am told that the eldest,
                     with the unsophisticated frankness that belongs to his age, made a personal
                     request to that effect to one of my acquaintances. One singular result of the
                     frequency of these funerals is the development of a critical and fastidious
                     taste in such matters on the part of myself and family. If I may so express
                     myself, without irreverence, we seldom turn out for anything less than six
                     carriages. Any number over this is usually breathlessly announced by Bridget
                     as, "Here's another, mum—and a good long one."</p>
                  <p>With these slight drawbacks my suburban residence is charming. To the serious
                     poet, and writer of elegiac verses, the aspect of Nature, viewed from my
                     veranda, is suggestive. I myself have experienced moments when the "sad
                     mechanic exercise" of verse would have been of infinite relief. The following
                     stanzas, by a young friend who has been stopping with me for the benefit of his
                     health, addressed to a duck that frequented a small pond in the vicinity of my
                     mansion, may be worthy of perusal, as showing the debilitated condition of his
                     system. I think I have met the idea conveyed in the first verse in some of
                     Hood's prose, but as my friend assures me that Hood was too conscientious to
                     appropriate anything, I conclude I am mistaken:</p>

                  <head>ON A VULGAR LITTLE BOY.</head>
                  <p>THE subject of this article is at present leaning against a tree directly
                     opposite to my window. He wears his cap with the wrong side before, apparently
                     for no other object than that which seems the most obvious—of showing more than
                     the average quantity of very dirty face. His clothes, which are worn with a
                     certain buttonless ease and freedom, display, in the different quality of their
                     fruit-stains, a pleasing indication of the progress of the seasons. The nose of
                     this vulgar little boy turns up at the end. I have noticed this in several
                     other vulgar little boys, although it is by no means improbable that youthful
                     vulgarity may be present without this facial peculiarity. Indeed, I am inclined
                     to the belief that it is rather the result of early inquisitiveness—of furtive
                     pressures against window panes, and of looking over fences, or of the habit of
                     biting large apples hastily—than an indication of scorn or juvenile
                     superciliousness. The vulgar little boy is more remarkable for his obtrusive
                     familiarity. It is my experience of his predisposition to this quality which
                     has induced me to write this article.</p>
                  <p>My acquaintance with him began in a moment of weakness. I have an unfortunate
                     predilection to cultivate originality in people, even when accompanied by
                     objectionable character. But, as I lack the firmness and skillfulness which
                     usually accompanies this taste in others, and enables them to drop
                     acquaintances when troublesome, I have surrounded myself with divers
                     unprofitable friends, among whom I count the vulgar little boy. The manner in
                     which he first attracted my attention was purely accidental. He was playing in
                     the street, and the driver of a passing vehicle cut at him, sportively, with
                     his whip. The vulgar little boy rose to his feet and hurled after his tormentor
                     a single sentence of invective. I refrain from repeating it, for I feel that I
                     could not do justice to it here. If I remember rightly, it conveyed, in a very
                     few words, a reflection on the legitimacy of the driver's birth; it hinted a
                     suspicion of his father's integrity, and impugned the fair fame of his mother;
                     it suggested incompetency in his present position, personal uncleanliness, and
                     evinced a skeptical doubt of his future salvation. As his youthful lips closed
                     over the last syllable, the eyes of the vulgar little boy met mine. Something
                     in my look emboldened him to wink. I did not repel the action nor the
                     complicity it implied. From that moment I fell into the power of the vulgar
                     little boy, and he has never left me since.</p>
                  <p>He haunts me in the streets and by-ways. He accosts me, when in the company of
                     friends, with repulsive freedom. He lingers about the gate of my<pb n="228-229"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000120"/> dwelling to waylay me as I issue forth to
                     business. Distance he overcomes by main strength of lungs, and he hails me from
                     the next street. He met me at the theatre the other evening, and demanded my
                     check with the air of a young footpad. I foolishly gave it to him, but
                     re-entering some time after, and comfortably seating myself in the parquet, I
                     was electrified by hearing my name called from the gallery with the addition of
                     a playful adjective. It was the vulgar little boy. During the performance he
                     projected spirally-twisted playbills in my direction, and indulged in a running
                     commentary on the supernumeraries as they entered.</p>
                  <p>To-day has evidently been a dull one with him. I observe he whistles the
                     popular airs of the period with less shrillness and intensity. Providence,
                     however, looks not unkindly on him, and delivers into his hands as it were two
                     nice little boys who have at this moment innocently strayed into our street.
                     They are pink and white children, and are dressed alike, and exhibit a certain
                     air of neatness and refinment which is alone sufficient to awaken the
                     antagonism of the vulgar little boy. A sigh of satisfaction breaks from his
                     breast. What does he do? Any other boy would content himself with simply
                     knocking the hats off their respective heads, and so vent his superfluous
                     vitality in a single act, besides precipitating the flight of the enemy. But
                     there are æsthetic considerations not to be overlooked; insult is to be added
                     to the injury inflicted, and in the struggles of the victim some justification
                     is to be sought for extreme measures. The two nice little boys perceive their
                     danger and draw closer to each other. The vulgar little boy begins by irony. He
                     affects to be overpowered by the magnificence of their costume. He addresses
                     me, (across the street and through the closed window,) and requests information
                     if there haply be a circus in the vicinity. He makes affectionate inquiries
                     after the health of their parents. He expresses a fear of maternal anxiety <choice>

                     </choice> regard to their welfare. He offers to conduct them home. One nice
                     little boy feebly retorts; but alas! his correct pronunciation, his grammatical
                     exactitude and his moderate epithets only provoke a scream of derision from the
                     vulgar little boy, who now rapidly changes his tactics. Staggering under the
                     weight of his vituperation, they fall easy victims to his dexter mawley. A wail
                     of lamentation goes up from our street. But as the subject of this article
                     seems to require a more vigorous handling than I had purposed to give it, I
                     find it necessary to abandon my present dignified position, seize my hat, open
                     the front door, and try a stronger method.</p>

                  <head>WAITING FOR THE SHIP.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A FORT POINT IDYL.</head>
                  <p>ABOUT an hour's ride from the Plaza there is a high bluff with the ocean
                     breaking uninterruptedly along its rocky beach. There are several cottages on
                     the sands, which look as if they had recently been cast up by a heavy sea. The
                     cultivated patch behind each tenement is fenced in by bamboos, broken spars and
                     drift-wood. With its few green cabbages and turnip-tops, each garden looks
                     something like an aquarium with the water turned off. In fact you would not be
                     surprised to meet a merman digging among the potatoes, or a mermaid milking a
                     sea cow hard by.</p>
                  <p>Near this place formerly arose a great semaphoric telegraph with its gaunt arms
                     tossed up against the horizon. It has been replaced by an observatory,
                     connected with an electric nerve to the heart of the great commercial city.
                     From this point the incoming ships are signaled, and again checked off at the
                     City Exchange. And while we are here looking for the expected steamer, let me
                     tell you a story.</p>
                  <p>Not long ago, a simple, hard-working mechanic, had amassed sufficient by
                     diligent labor in the mines to send home for his wife and two children. He
                     arrived in San Francisco a month before the time the ship was due, for he was a
                     western man and had made the overland journey and knew little of ships or seas
                     or gales. He procured work in the city, but as the time approached he would go
                     to the shipping office regularly every day. The month passed, but the ship came
                     not; then a month and a week, two weeks, three weeks, two months, and then a
                     year.</p>
                  <p>The rough, patient face, with soft lines overlying its hard features, which had
                     become a daily apparition at the shipping agent's, then disappeared. It turned
                     up one afternoon at the observatory as the setting sun relieved the operator
                     from his duties. There was something so childlike and simple in the few
                     questions asked by this stranger, touching his business, that the operator
                     spent some time to explain. When the mystery of signals and telegraphs was
                     unfolded, the stranger had one more question to ask. "How long might a vessel
                     be absent before they would give up expecting her?" The operator couldn't tell;
                     it would depend on circumstances. Would it be a year? Yes, it might be a year,
                     and vessels had been given up for lost after two years and had come home. The
                     stranger put his rough hand on the operator's, and thanked him for his
                     "troubil" and went away.</p>
                  <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6642-00000122"/>
                  <p>Still the ship came not. Stately clippers swept into the Gate, and merchantmen
                     went by with colors flying, and the welcoming gun of the steamer often
                     reverberated among the hills. Then the patient face, with the old resigned
                     expression, but a brighter, wistful look in the eye, was regularly met on the
                     crowded decks of the steamer as she disembarked her living freight. He may have
                     had a dimly-defined hope that the missing ones might yet come this way, as only
                     another road over that strange unknown expanse. But he talked with ship
                     captains and sailors and even this last hope seemed to fail. When the careworn
                     face and bright eyes were presented again at the observatory, the operator,
                     busily engaged, could not spare time to answer foolish interrogatories, so he
                     went away. But as night fell, he was seen sitting on the rocks with his face
                     turned seaward, and was seated there all that night.</p>
                  <p>When he became hopelessly insane, for that was what the physicians said made
                     his eyes so bright, and wistful, he was cared for by a fellow-craftsman who had
                     known his troubles. He was allowed to indulge his fancy of going out to watch
                     for the ship, in which she "and the children" were, at night when no one else
                     was watching. He had made up his mind that the ship would come in at night.
                     This, and the idea that he would relieve the operator, who would be tired with
                     watching all day, seemed to please him. So he went out and relieved the
                     operator every night!</p>
                  <p>For two years the ships came and went. He was there to see the outward-bound
                     clipper, and greet her on her return. He was known only by a few who frequented
                     the place. When he was missed at last from his accustomed spot, a day or two
                     elapsed before any alarm was felt. One Sunday, a party of pleasure-seekers
                     clambering over the rocks were attracted by the barking of a dog that had run
                     on before them. When they came up they found a plainly dressed man lying there
                     dead. There were a few papers in his pocket—chiefly slips cut from different
                     journals of old marine memoranda—and his face was turned towards the distant
                     sea.</p>

                  <head>THE LEGEND OF MONTE DEL DIABLO.</head>
                  <p>THE cautious reader will detect a lack of authenticity in the following pages.
                     I am not a cautious reader myself, yet I confess with some concern to the
                     absence of much documentary evidence in support of the singular incident I am
                     about to relate. Disjointed memoranda, the proceedings of <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">ayuntamientos</foreign> and early departmental <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">juntas,</foreign> with other records of a primitive and
                     superstitious people, have been my inadequate authorities. It is but just to
                     state, however, that, though this particular story lacks corroboration, in
                     ransacking the Spanish archives of Upper California I have met with many more
                     surprising and incredible stories, attested and supported to a degree that
                     would have placed this legend beyond a cavil or doubt. I have, also, never lost
                     faith in the legend myself, and in so doing have profited much from the
                     examples of divers grant-claimants, who have often jostled me in their more
                     practical researches, and who have my sincere sympathy at the skepticism of a
                     modern hard-headed and practical world.</p>
                  <p>For many years after Father Junipero Serro first<pb n="238-239"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000125"/> rang his bell in the wilderness of Upper
                     California, the spirit which animated that adventurous priest did not wane. The
                     conversion of the heathen went on rapidly in the establishment of Missions
                     throughout the land. So sedulously did the good Fathers set about their work,
                     that around their isolated chapels there presently arose <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">adobe</foreign> huts, whose mud-plastered and savage tenants
                     partook regularly of the provisions, and <choice>
                        <sic>ocoasionally</sic>
                        <corr>occasionally</corr>
                     </choice> of the Sacrament, of their pious hosts. Nay, so great was their
                     progress, that one zealous Padre is reported to have administered the Lord's
                     Supper one Sabbath morning to "over three hundred heathen Salvages." It was not
                     to be wondered that the Enemy of Souls, being greatly incensed thereat, and
                     alarmed at his decreasing popularity, should have grievously tempted and
                     embarrassed these Holy Fathers, as we shall presently see.</p>
                  <p>Yet they were happy, peaceful days for California. The vagrant keels of prying
                     Commerce had not as you, ruffled the lordly gravity of her bays. No torn and
                     ragged gulch betrayed the suspicion of golden treasure. The wild oats drooped
                     idly in the morning heat, or wrestled with the afternoon breezes. Deer and
                     antelope dotted the plain. The watercourses brawled in their familiar channels,
                     nor dreamed of ever shifting their regular tide. The wonders of the Yo-Semite
                     and Calaveras were as yet unrecorded. The Holy Fathers noted little of the
                     landscape beyond the barbaric prodigality with which the quick soil repaid the
                     sowing. A new conversion, the advent of a Saint's day, or the baptism of an
                     Indian baby, was at once the chronicle and marvel of their day.</p>
                  <p>At this blissful epoch, there lived, at the Mission of San Pablo, Father José
                     Antonio Haro, a worthy brother of the Society of Jesus. He was of tall and
                     cadaverous aspect. A somewhat romantic history had given a poetic interest to
                     his lugubrious visage. While a youth, pursuing his studies at famous Salamanca,
                     he had become enamored of the charms of Doña Cármen de Torrencevara, as that
                     lady passed to her matutinal devotions. Untoward circumstances, hastened,
                     perhaps, by a wealthier suitor, brought this amour to a disastrous issue; and
                     Father José entered a monastery, taking upon himself the vows of celibacy. It
                     was as here that his natural fervor and poetic enthusiasm conceived expression
                     as a missionary. A longing to convert the uncivilized heathen succeeded his
                     frivolous earthly passion, and a desire to explore and develop unknown
                     fastnesses continually possessed him. In his flashing eye and sombre exterior
                     was detected a singular commingling of the discreet Las Casas and the impetuous
                     Balboa.</p>
                  <p>Fired by this pious zeal, Father José went forward in the van of Christian
                     pioneers. On reaching Mexico, he obtained authority to establish the Mission of
                     San Pablo. Like the good Junipero, accompanied only by an acolyth and muleteer,
                     he unsaddled his mules in a dusky <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon,</foreign> and
                     rang his bell in the wilderness. The savages—a peaceful, inoffensive, and
                     inferior race—presently flocked around him.<pb n="240-241"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000126"/> The nearest military post was far away, which
                     contributed much to the security of these pious pilgrims, who found their open
                     trustfulness and amiability better fitted to repress hostility than the
                     presence of an armed, suspicious and brawling soldiery. So the good Father José
                     said matins and prime, mass and vespers, in the heart of Sin and Heathenism,
                     taking no heed to himself, but looking only to the welfare of the Holy Church.
                     Conversions soon followed, and, on the 7th of July, 1760, the first Indian baby
                     was baptized—an event which, as Father José piously records, "exceeds the
                     richnesse of gold or precious jewels or the chancing upon the Ophir of
                     Solomon." I quote this incident as best suited to show the ingenuous blending
                     of poetry and piety which distinguished Father José's record.</p>
                  <p>The Mission of San Pablo progressed and prospered until the pious founder
                     thereof, like the infidel Alexander, might have wept that there were no more
                     heathen worlds to conquer. But his ardent and enthusiastic spirit could not
                     long brook an idleness that seemed begotten of sin; and one pleasant August
                     morning, in the year of grace 1770, Father José issued from the outer court of
                     the Mission building, equipped to explore the field for new missionary
                     labors.</p>
                  <p>Nothing could exceed the quiet gravity and unpretentiousness of the little
                     cavalcade. First rode a stout muleteer, leading a pack-mule laden with the
                     provisions of the party, together with a few cheap crucifixes and hawks' bells.
                     After him came the devout vout Padre José, bearing his breviary and cross,
                     with, a black <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serapa</foreign> thrown around his
                     shoulders; while on either side trotted a dusky convert, anxious to show a
                     proper sense of their regeneration by acting as guides into the wilds of their
                     heathen brethren. Their new condition was agreeably shown by the absence of the
                     usual mud-plaster, which in their unconverted state they assumed to keep away
                     vermin and cold. The morning was bright and propitious. Before their departure,
                     mass had been said in the chapel, and the protection of St. Ignatius invoked
                     against all contingent evils, but especially against bears, which, like the
                     fiery dragons of old, seemed to cherish unconquerable hostility to the Holy
                     Church.</p>
                  <p>As they wound through the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon,</foreign> charming
                     birds disported upon boughs and sprays, and sober quails piped from the alders;
                     the willowy water-courses gave a musical utterance, and the long grass
                     whispered on the hillside. On entering the deeper defiles, above them towered
                     dark green masses of pine, and occasionally the <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >madroño</foreign> shook its bright scarlet berries. As they toiled up many
                     a steep ascent, Father José sometimes picked up fragments of scoria, which
                     spake to his imagination of direful volcanoes and impending earthquakes. To the
                     less scientific mind of the muleteer Ignacio they had even a more terrifying
                     significance; and he once or twice snuffed the air suspiciously, and declared
                     that it smelt of sulphur. So the first day of their journey wore away, and at
                     night they encamped without having met a single heathen face.</p>
                  <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6642-00000127"/>
                  <p>It was on this night that the Enemy of Souls appeared to Ignacio in an
                     appalling form. He had retired to a secluded part of the camp, and had sunk
                     upon his knees in prayerful meditation, when he looked up and perceived the
                     Arch-Fiend in the likeness of a monstrous bear. The Evil One was seated on his
                     hind legs immediately before him, with his fore paws joined together just below
                     his black muzzle. Wisely conceiving this remarkable attitude to be in mockery
                     and derision of his devotions, the worthy muleteer was transported with fury.
                     Seizing an arquebuse, he instantly closed his eyes and fired. When he had
                     recovered from the effects of the terrific discharge, the apparition had
                     disappeared. Father José, awakened by the report, reached the spot only in time
                     to chide the muleteer for wasting powder and ball in a contest with one whom a
                     single <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ave</foreign> would have been sufficient to
                     utterly discomfit. What further reliance he placed on Ignacio's story is not
                     known; but, in commemoration of a worthy Californian custom, the place was
                     called <foreign xml:lang="SPA">La Cañada de la Tentacion del Pio
                        Muletero,</foreign> or "The Glen of the Temptation of the Pious Muleteer," a
                     name which it retains to this day.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, the party, issuing from a narrow gorge, came upon a long
                     valley, sear and burnt with the shadeless heat. Its lower extremity was lost in
                     a fading line of low hills, which, gathering might and volume toward the upper
                     end of the valley, upheaved a stupendous bulwark against the breezy North. The
                     peak of this awful spur was just touched by a fleecy cloud that shifted to and
                     fro like a banneret. Father José gazed with mingled awe and admiration. By a
                     singular coincidence, the muleteer Ignacio uttered the simple ejaculation
                        "<foreign xml:lang="SPA">Diablo!</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>As they penetrated the valley, they soon began to miss the agreeable life and
                     companionable echoes of the <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> they had
                     quitted. Huge fissures in the parched soil seemed to gape as with thirsty
                     mouths. A few squirrels darted from the earth, and disappeared as mysteriously
                     before the jingling mules. A gray wolf trotted leisurely along just ahead. But
                     whichever way Father José turned, the mountain always asserted itself and
                     arrested his wandering eye. Out of the dry and arid valley, it seemed to spring
                     into cooler and bracing life. Deep cavernous shadows dwelt along its base;
                     rocky fastnesses appeared midway of its elevation; and on either side huge
                     black hills diverged like massy roots from a central trunk. His lively fancy
                     pictured these hills peopled with a majestic and intelligent race of savages;
                     and looking into futurity, he already saw a monstrous cross crowning the
                     dome-like summit. Far different were the sensations of the muleteer, who saw in
                     those awful solitudes only fiery dragons, colossal bears, and break-neck
                     trails. The <choice>

                     </choice>, Concepcion and Incarnacion, trotting modestly beside the Padre,
                     recognized, perhaps, some manifestation of their former weird mythology.</p>
                  <p>At nightfall they reached the base of the mountain. Here Father José unpacked
                     his mules, said vespers, and, formally ringing his bell, called upon<pb
                        n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6642-00000128"/> the Gentiles within hearing to come
                     and accept the Holy Faith. The echoes of the black frowning hills around him
                     caught up the pious invitation, and repeated it at intervals; but no Gentiles
                     appeared that night. Nor were the devotions of the muleteer again disturbed,
                     although he afterward asserted, that, when the Father's exhortation was ended,
                     a mocking peal of laughter came from the mountain. Nothing daunted by these
                     intimations of the near hostility of the Evil One, Father José declared his
                     intention to ascend the mountain at early dawn; and before the sun rose the
                     next morning he was leading the way.</p>
                  <p>The ascent was in many places difficult and dangerous. Huge fragments of rock
                     often lay across the trail, and after a few hours' climbing they were forced to
                     leave their mules in a little gully, and continue the ascent afoot.
                     Unaccustomed to such exertion, Father José often stopped to wipe the
                     perspiration from his thin cheeks. As the day wore on, a strange silence
                     oppressed them. Except the occasional pattering of a squirrel, or a rustling in
                     the <hi rend="i"/>chimisal bushes, there were no signs of life. The half-human
                     print of a bear's foot sometimes appeared before them, at which Ignacio always
                     crossed himself piously. The eye was sometimes cheated by a dripping from the
                     rocks, which on closer inspection proved to be a resinous oily liquid with an
                     abominable sulphurous smell. When they were within a short distance of the
                     summit, the discreet Ignacio, selecting a sheltered nook for the camp, slipped
                     aside and busied himself in preparations for the evening, leaving the Holy
                     Father to continue the ascent alone. Never was there a more thoughtless act of
                     prudence, never a more imprudent piece of caution. Without noticing the
                     desertion, buried in pious reflection, Father José pushed mechanically on, and,
                     reaching the summit, cast himself down and gazed upon the prospect.</p>
                  <p>Below him lay a succession of valleys opening into each other like gentle
                     lakes, until they were lost to the southward. Westerly the distant range hid
                     the bosky <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañada</foreign> which sheltered the mission
                     of San Pablo. In the farther distance the Pacific Ocean stretched away, bearing
                     a cloud of fog upon its bosom, which crept through the entrance of the bay, and
                     rolled thickly between him and the Northeastward; the same fog hid the base of
                     mountain and the view beyond. Still, from time to time the fleecy veil parted,
                     and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers, mountain-defiles, and
                     rolling plains, sear with ripened oats, and bathed in the glow of the setting
                     sun. As Father José gazed, he was penetrated with a pious longing. Already his
                     imagination, filled with enthusiastic conceptions, beheld all that vast expanse
                     gathered under the mild sway of the Holy Faith, and peopled with zealous
                     converts. Each little knoll in fancy becomes crowned with a chapel; from each
                     dark <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> gleamed the white walls of a
                     mission building. Growing bolder in his enthusiasm, and looking farther into
                     futurity, he beheld a new Spain rising on these savage shores. He already saw
                     the spires of stately cathedrals, the domes of palaces, vineyards, gardens, and
                        groves.<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6642-00000129"/> Convents, half hid among
                     the hills, peeping from plantations of branching limes; and long processions of
                     chanting nuns wound through the defiles. So completely was the good Father's
                     conception of the future confounded with the past, that even in their choral
                     strain the well-remembered accents of Cármen struck his ear. He was busied in
                     these fanciful imaginings, when suddenly over that extended prospect the faint,
                     distant tolling of a bell rang sadly out and died. It was the <foreign
                        xml:lang="LAT">Angelus.</foreign> Father José listened with superstitious
                     exaltation. The mission of San Pablo was far away, and the sound must have been
                     some miraculous omen. But never before, to his enthusiastic sense, did the
                     sweet seriousness of this angelic symbol come with such strange significance.
                     With the last faint peal, his glowing fancy seemed to cool; the fog closed in
                     below him, and the good Father remembered he had not had his supper. He had
                     risen and was wrapping his <foreign xml:lang="SPA">serapa</foreign> around him,
                     when he perceived for the first time that he was not alone.</p>
                  <p>Nearly opposite, and where should have been the faithless Ignacio, a grave and
                     decorous figure was seated. His appearance was that of an elderly <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">hidalgo,</foreign> dressed in mourning, with moustaches of
                     iron-gray carefully waxed and twisted around a pair of lantern-jaws. The
                     monstrous hat and prodigious feather, the enormous ruff and exaggerated
                     trunk-hose, contrasted with a frame shriveled and wizened, all belonged to a
                     century previous. Yet Father José was not astonished. His adventurous life and
                     poetic imagination, continually on the look-out for the marvelous velous, gave
                     him a certain advantage over the practical and material minded. He instantly
                     detected the diabolical quality of his visitant, and was prepared. With equal
                     coolness and courtesy he met the cavalier's obeisance.</p>
                  <p>"I ask your pardon, Sir Priest," said the stranger, "for disturbing your
                     meditations. Pleasant they must have been, and right fanciful, I imagine, when
                     occasioned by so fair a prospect."</p>
                  <p>"Worldly, perhaps, Sir Devil,—for such I take you to be," said the Holy Father,
                     as the stranger bowed his black plumes to the ground; "worldly, perhaps; for it
                     hath pleased Heaven to retain even in our regenerated state much that
                     pertaineth to the flesh, yet still, I trust, not without some speculation for
                     the welfare of the Holy Church. In dwelling upon yon fair expanse, mine eyes
                     have been graciously opened with prophetic inspiration, and the promise of the
                     heathen as an inheritance hath marvelously recurred to me. For there can be
                     none lack such diligence in the True Faith, but may see that even the
                     conversion of these <choice>

                        <corr>pitiful</corr>
                     </choice> salvages hath a meaning. As the blessed St. Ignatius discreetly
                     observes," continued Father José, clearing his throat and slightly elevating
                     his voice, "'the heathen is given to the warriors of Christ, even as the pearls
                     of rare discovery which gladden the hearts of shipmen.' Nay, I might say"——</p>
                  <p>But here the stranger, who had been wrinkling his brows and twisting his
                     moustaches with well-bred patience, took advantage of an oratorical pause to<pb
                        n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6642-00000130"/> "It grieves me, Sir Priest, to
                     interrupt the current of your eloquence as discourteously as I have already
                     broken your meditations; but the day already waneth to night. I have a matter
                     of serious import to make with you, could I entreat your cautious consideration
                     a few moments."</p>
                  <p>Father José hesitated. The temptation was great, and the prospect of acquiring
                     some knowledge of the Great Enemy's plans not the least trifling object. And if
                     the truth must be told, there was a certain decorum about the stranger that
                     interested the Padre. Though well aware of the Protean shapes the Arch-Fiend
                     could assume, and though free from the weaknesses of the flesh, Father José was
                     not above the temptations of the spirit. Had the Devil appeared, as in the case
                     of the pious St. Anthony, in the likeness of a comely damsel, the good Father,
                     with his certain experience of the deceitful sex, would have whisked her away
                     in the saying of a paternoster. But there was, added to the security of age, a
                     grave sadness about the stranger,—a thoughtful consciousness as of being at a
                     great moral disadvantage,—which at once decided him on a magnanimous course of
                     conduct.</p>
                  <p>The stranger then proceeded to inform him, that he had been diligently
                     observing the Holy Father's triumphs in the valley. That, far from being
                     greatly exercised thereat, he had been only grieved to see so enthusiastic and
                     chivalrous an antagonist wasting his zeal in a hopeless work. For, he observed,
                     the issue of the great battle of Good and Evil had been otherwise settled, as
                     he would presently show him. "It wants but a few moments of night," he
                     continued, "and over this interval of twilight, as you know, I have been given
                     complete control. Look to the West."</p>
                  <p>As the Padre turned, the stranger took his enormous hat from his head, and
                     waved it three times before him. At each sweep of the prodigious feather, the
                     fog grew thinner, until it melted impalpably away, and the former landscape
                     returned, yet warm with the glowing sun. As Father José gazed, a strain of
                     martial music arose from the valley, and issued from a deep <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">cañon,</foreign> the good Father beheld a long cavalcade of
                     gallant cavaliers, habited like his companion. As they swept down the plain,
                     they were joined by like processions, that slowly defiled from every ravine and
                        <foreign xml:lang="SPA">cañon</foreign> of the mysterious mountain. From
                     time to time the peal of a trumpet swelled fitfully upon the breeze; the cross
                     of Santiago glittered, and the royal banners of Castile and Aragon waved over
                     the moving column. So they moved on solemnly toward the sea, where, in the
                     distance, Father José saw stately caravels, bearing the same familiar banner,
                     awaiting them. The good Padre gazed with conflicting emotions, and the serious
                     voice of the stranger broke the silence.</p>
                  <p>"Thou hast beheld, Sir Priest, the fading footprints of adventurous Castile.
                     Thou hast seen the declining glory of old Spain,—declining as yonder brilliant
                     sun. The spectre she hath wrested from the heathen is fast dropping from her
                     decrepit and fleshless<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6642-00000131"/> less grasp.
                     The children she hath fostered shall know her no longer. The soil she hath
                     acquired shall be lost to her as irrevocably as she herself hath thrust the
                     Moor from her own Granada."</p>
                  <p>The stranger paused, and his voice seemed broken by emotion; at the same time,
                     Father José, whose sympathizing heart yearned toward the departing banners,
                     cried in poignant accents—</p>
                  <p>"Farewell ye gallant cavaliers and Christian soldiers! Farewell, thou, Nuñes de
                     Balboa! thou, Alonzo de Ojeda! and thou, most venerable Las Casas! Farewell,
                     and may Heaven prosper still the seed ye left behind!"</p>
                  <p>Then turning to the stranger, Father José beheld him gravely draw his
                     pocket-handkerchief from the basket-hilt of his rapier, and apply it decorously
                     to his eyes.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon this weakness, Sir Priest," said the cavalier, apologetically; "but
                     these worthy gentlemen were ancient friends of mine, and have done me many a
                     delicate service,—much more, perchance, than these poor sables may signify," he
                     added, with a grim gesture toward the mourning suit he wore.</p>
                  <p>Father José was too much preoccupied in reflection to notice the equivocal
                     nature of this tribute, and, after a few moments' silence, said, as if
                     continuing his thought—</p>
                  <p>"But the seed they have planted shall thrive and prosper on this fruitful
                     soil?"</p>
                  <p>As if answering the interrogatory, the stranger turned to the opposite
                     direction, and, again waving his hat, said, in the same serious tone—</p>
                  <p>"Look to the East!"</p>
                  <p>The Father turned, and, as the fog broke away before the waving plume, he saw
                     that the sun was rising. Issuing with its bright beams through the passes of
                     the snowy mountains beyond, appeared a strange and motley crew. Instead of the
                     dark and romantic visages of his last phantom train, the Father beheld with
                     strange concern the blue eyes and flaxen hair of a Saxon race. In place of
                     martial airs and musical utterance, there rose upon the ear a strange din of
                     harsh gutturals and singular sibilation. Instead of the decorous tread and
                     stately mien of the cavaliers of the former vision, they came pushing,
                     bustling, panting, and swaggering. And as they passed, the good Father noticed
                     that giant trees were prostrated as with the breath of a tornado, and the
                     bowels of the earth were torn and rent as with a convulsion. And Father José
                     looked in vain for holy cross or Christian symbol; there was but one that
                     seemed an ensign, and he crossed himself with holy horror as he perceived it
                     bore the effigy of a bear!</p>
                  <p>"Who are these swaggering Ishmaelites?" he asked, with something of asperity in
                     his tone.</p>
                  <p>The stranger was gravely silent.</p>
                  <p>"What do they here, with neither cross nor holy symbol?" he again demanded.</p>
                  <p>"Have you the courage to see, Sir Priest?" responded the stranger, quietly.</p>
                  <p>Father José felt his crucifix, as a lonely traveler might his rapier, and
                     assented.</p>
                  <p>"Step under the shadow of my plume," said the stranger.</p>
                  <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6642-00000132"/>
                  <p>Father José stepped beside him, and they instantly sank through the earth.</p>
                  <p>When he opened his eyes, which had remained closed in prayerful meditation
                     during his rapid descent, he found himself in a vast vault, bespangled
                     over-head with luminous points like the starred firmament. It was also lighted
                     by a yellow glow that seemed to proceed from a mighty sea or lake that occupied
                     the centre of the chamber. Around this subterranean sea dusky figures flitted,
                     bearing ladles filled with the yellow fluid, which they had replenished from
                     its depths. From this lake diverging streams of the same mysterious flood
                     penetrated like mighty rivers the cavernous distance. As they walked by the
                     banks of this glittering Styx, Father José perceived how the liquid stream at
                     certain places became solid. The ground was strewn with glittering flakes. One
                     of these the Padre picked up and curiously examined. It was virgin gold.</p>
                  <p>An expression of discomfiture overcast the good Father's face at this
                     discovery; but there was trace neither of malice nor satisfaction in the
                     stranger's air, which was still of serious and fateful contemplation. When
                     Father José recovered his equanimity, he said, bitterly—</p>
                  <p>"This, then, Sir Devil, is your work! This is your deceitful lure for the weak
                     souls of sinful nations! So would you replace the Christian grace of holy
                     Spain!"</p>
                  <p>"This is what must be," returned the stranger, gloomily. "But listen, Sir
                     Priest. It lies with you to avert the issue for a time. Leave me here in peace.
                     Go back to Castile, and take with you your bells, your images, and your
                     missions. Continue here, and you only precipitate results. Stay! promise me you
                     will do this, and you shall not lack that which will render your old age an
                     ornament and a blessing;" and the stranger motioned significantly to the
                     lake.</p>
                  <p>It was here, the legend discreetly relates, that the Devil showed—as he always
                     shows sooner or later—his cloven hoof. The worthy Padre, sorely perplexed by
                     his threefold vision, and, if the truth must be told, a little nettled at this
                     wresting away of the glory of holy Spanish discovery, had shown some
                     hesitation. But the unlucky bribe of the Enemy of Souls touched his Castilian
                     spirit. Starting back in deep disgust, he brandished his crucifix in the face
                     of the unmasked Fiend, and, in a voice that made the dusky vault resound,
                     cried—</p>
                  <p>"Avaunt thee, Sathanas! Diabolus, I defy thee! What! wouldst thou bribe me,—me,
                     a brother of the Sacred Society of the Holy Jesus, Licentiate of Cordova and
                     Inquisitor of Guadalaxara? Thinkest thou to buy me with thy sordid treasure?
                     Avaunt!"</p>
                  <p>What might have been the issue of this rupture, and how complete might have
                     been the triumph of the Holy Father over the Arch-Fiend, who was recoiling
                     aghast at these sacred titles and the flourishing symbol, we can never know,
                     for at that moment the crucifix slipped through his fingers.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had it touched the ground before Devil and Holy Father simultaneously
                     cast themselves to<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6642-00000133"/> ward it. In the
                     struggle they clinched, and the pious José, who was as much the superior of his
                     antagonist in bodily as in spiritual strength, was about to treat the Great
                     Adversary to a back somersault, when he suddenly felt the long nails of the
                     stranger piercing his flesh. A new fear seized his heart, a numbing chillness
                     crept through his body, and he struggled to free himself, but in vain. A
                     strange roaring was in his ears; the lake and cavern danced before his eyes and
                     vanished; and with a loud cry he sank senseless to the ground.</p>
                  <p>When he recovered his consciousness he was aware of a gentle swaying motion of
                     his body. He opened his eyes, and saw it was high noon, and that he was being
                     carried in a litter through the valley. He felt stiff, and, looking down,
                     perceived that his arm was tightly bandaged to his side.</p>
                  <p>He closed his eyes, and after a few words of thankful prayer, thought how
                     miraculously he had been preserved, and made a vow of candlesticks to the
                     blessed Saint José. He then called in a faint voice, and presently the penitent
                     Ignacio stood beside him.</p>
                  <p>The joy the poor fellow felt at his patron's returning consciousness for some
                     time choked his utterance. He could only ejaculate. "A miracle! Blessed Saint
                     José, he lives!" and kiss the Padre's bandaged hand. Father José, more intent
                     on his last night's experience, waited for his emotion to subside, and asked
                     where he had been found.</p>
                  <p>"On the mountain, your Reverence, but a few <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >varas</foreign> from where he attacked you."</p>
                  <p>"How?—you saw him, then?" asked the Padre, in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"Saw him, your Reverence! Mother of God, I should think I did! And your
                     Reverence shall see him too, if he ever comes again within range of Ignacio's
                     arquebuse."</p>
                  <p>"What mean you, Ignacio?" said the Padre, sitting bolt-upright in his
                     litter.</p>
                  <p>"Why, the bear, your Reverence,—the bear, Holy Father, who attacked your
                     worshipful person while you were meditating on the top of yonder mountain."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said the Holy Father, lying down again. "Chut, child! I would be at
                     peace."</p>
                  <p>When he reached the Mission, he was tenderly cared for, and in a few weeks was
                     enabled to resume those duties from which, as will be seen, not even the
                     machinations of the Evil One could divert him. The news of his physical
                     disaster spread over the country; and a letter to the Bishop of Guadalaxara
                     contained a confidential and detailed account of the good Father's spiritual
                     temptation. But in some way the story leaked out; and long after José was
                     gathered to his fathers, his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling
                     and whispered narrative. The mountain was generally shunned. It is true that
                     Señor Joaquin Pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain;
                     but as Señora Pedrillo was known to be a termagant half-breed, the Señor was
                     not supposed to be over-fastidious.</p>
                  <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6642-00000134"/>
                  <p>Such is the Legend of Monte del Diablo. As I said before, it may seem to lack
                     essential corroboration. The discrepancy between the Father's narrative and the
                     actual climax has given rise to some skepticism on the part of ingenious
                     quibblers. All such I would simply refer to that part of the report of Señor
                     Julio Serro, Sub-Prefect of San Pablo, before whom attest of the above was
                     made. Touching this matter the worthy Prefect observes,—"That although the body
                     of Father Jose doth show evidence of grievous conflict in the flesh, yet that
                     is no proof that the enemy of Souls, who could assume the figure of a decorous,
                     elderly <foreign xml:lang="SPA">caballero,</foreign> could not at the same time
                     transform himself into a bear for his own vile purposes."</p>

                  <head>THE ADVENTURE OF PADRE VICENTIO.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A LEGEND OF SAN FRANCISCO.</head>
                  <p>ONE pleasant New Year's Eve, about forty years ago, Padre Vicentio was slowly
                     picking his way across the sand-hills from the Mission Dolores. As he climbed
                     the crest of the ridge beside Mission Creek, his broad, shining face might have
                     been easily mistaken for the beneficent image of the rising moon, so bland was
                     its smile and so indefinite its features. For the padre was a man of notable
                     reputation and character; his ministration at the Mission of San José had been
                     marked with cordiality and unction; he was adored by the simple-minded savages,
                     and had succeeded in impressing his individuality so strongly upon them that
                     the very children were said to have miraculously resembled him in feature.</p>
                  <p>As the holy man reached the loneliest portion of the road, he naturally put
                     spurs to his mule as if to quicken that decorous pace which the obedient animal
                     had acquired through long experience of its<pb n="258-259"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000135"/> master's habits. The locality had an unfavorable
                     reputation. Sailors—deserters from whaleships—had been seen lurking about the
                     outskirts of the town, and low scrub oaks which everywhere beset the trail
                     might have easily concealed some desperate runaway. Besides these material
                     obstructions, the devil, whose hostility to the church was well known, was said
                     to sometimes haunt the vicinity in the likeness of a spectral whaler, who had
                     met his death in a drunken bout, from a harpoon in the hands of a companion.
                     The ghost of this unfortunate mariner was frequently observed sitting on the
                     hill toward the dusk of evening, armed with his favorite weapon and a tub
                     containing a coil of line, looking out for some belated traveler on whom to
                     exercise his professional skill. It is related that the good father José Maria
                     of the Mision Dolores had been twice attacked by this phantom sportsman; that
                     once, on returning from San Francisco, and panting with exertion from climbing
                     the hill, he was startled by a stentorian cry of "There she blows!" quickly
                     followed by a hurtling harpoon, which buried itself in the sand beside him;
                     that on another occasion he narrowly escaped destruction, his serapa having
                     been transfixed by the diabolical harpoon and dragged away in triumph. Popular
                     opinion seems to have been divided as to the reason for the devil's particular
                     attention to Father José, some asserting that the extreme piety of the padre
                     excited the Evil One's animosity, and others that his adipose tendency simply
                     rendered him, from a professional view-point, a profitable capture.</p>
                  <p>Had Father Vicentio been inclined to scoff at this apparition as a heretical
                     innovation, there was still the story of Concepcion, the Demon Vaquero, whose
                     terrible riata was fully as potent as the whaler's harpoon. Concepcion, when in
                     the flesh, had been a celebrated herder of cattle and wild horses, and was
                     reported to have chased the devil in the shape of a fleet <foreign
                        xml:lang="SPA">pinto</foreign> colt all the way from San Luis Obispo to San
                     Francisco, vowing not to give up the chase until he had overtaken the disguised
                     Arch-Enemy. This the devil prevented by resuming his own shape, but kept the
                     unfortunate vaquero to the fulfillment of his rash vow; and Concepcion still
                     scoured the coast on a phantom steed, beguiling the monotony of his eternal
                     pursuit by lassoing travelers, dragging them at the heels of his unbroken
                     mustang until they were eventually picked up, half-strangled, by the road-side.
                     The padre listened attentively for the tramp of this terrible rider. But no
                     footfall broke the stillness of the night; even the hoofs of his own mule sank
                     noiselessly in the shifting sand. Now and then a rabbit bounded lightly by him,
                     or a quail ran into the brush. The melancholy call of plover from the adjoining
                     marshes of Mission Creek came to him so faintly and fitfully that it seemed
                     almost a recollection of the past rather than a reality of the present.</p>
                  <p>To add to his discomposure one of those heavy sea fogs peculiar to the locality
                     began to drift across the hills and presently encompassed him. While
                     endeavoring to evade its cold embraces, Padre Vicentio<pb n="260-261"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000136"/> incautiously drove his heavy spurs into the
                     flanks of his mule as that puzzled animal was hesitating on the brink of a
                     steep declivity. Whether the poor beast was indignant at this novel outrage, or
                     had been for some time reflecting on the evils of being priest-ridden, has not
                     transpired; enough that he suddenly threw up his heels, pitching the reverend
                     man over his head, and, having accomplished this feat, coolly dropped on his
                     knees and tumbled after his rider.</p>
                  <p>Over and over went the padre, closely followed by his faithless mule. Luckily
                     the little hollow which received the pair was of sand that yielded to the
                     superincumbent weight, half burying them without further injury. For some
                     moments the poor man lay motionless, vainly endeavoring to collect his
                     scattered senses. A hand irreverently laid upon his collar, and a rough shake,
                     assisted to recall his consciousness. As the padre staggered to his feet he
                     found himself confronted by a stranger.</p>
                  <p>Seen dimly through the fog, and under circumstances that to say the least were
                     not prepossessing, the new comer had an inexpressibly mysterious and
                     brigand-like aspect. A long boat-cloak concealed his figure, and a slouched hat
                     hid his features, permitting only his eyes to glisten in the depths. With a
                     deep groan the padre slipped from the stranger's grasp and subsided into the
                     soft sand again.</p>
                  <p>"Gad's life!" said the stranger, pettishly, "hast no more bones in thy fat
                     carcass than a jelly-fish? Lend a hand, here! Yo, heave ho!" and he dragged the
                     padre into an upright position. "Now, then, who and what art thou?"</p>
                  <p>The padre could not help thinking that the question might have more properly
                     been asked by himself; but with an odd mixture of dignity and trepidation he
                     began enumerating his different titles, which were by no means brief, and would
                     have been alone sufficient to strike awe in the bosom of an ordinary adversary.
                     The stranger irreverently broke in upon his formal phrases, and assuring him
                     that a priest was the very person he was looking for, coolly replaced the old
                     man's hat, which had tumbled off, and bade him accompany him at once on an
                     errand of spiritual counsel to one who was even then lying in extremity. "To
                     think," said the stranger, "that I should stumble upon the very man I was
                     seeking! Body of Bacchus! but this is lucky! Follow me quickly, for there is no
                     time to lose."</p>
                  <p>Like most easy natures the positive assertion of the stranger, and withal a
                     certain authoritative air of command, overcame what slight objections the padre
                     might have feebly nurtured during this remarkable interview. The spiritual
                     invitation was one, also, that he dared not refuse; not only that; but it
                     tended somewhat to remove the superstitious dread with which he had begun to
                     regard the mysterious stranger. Following at a respectful distance, the padre
                     could not help observing with a thrill of horror that the stranger's footsteps
                     made no impression on the sand, and his figure seemed at times to blend and
                     incorporate itself with the fog, until the holy man was<pb n="262-263"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000137"/> obliged to wait for its reappearance. In one of
                     these intervals of embarrassment he heard the ringing of the far-off Mission
                     bell, proclaiming the hour of midnight. Scarcely had the last stroke died away
                     before the announcement was taken up and repeated by a multitude of bells of
                     all sizes, and the air was filled with the sound of striking clocks and the
                     pealing of steeple chimes. The old man uttered a cry of alarm. The stranger
                     sharply demanded the cause. "The bells! did you not hear them?" gasped Padre
                     Vicentio. "Tush! tush!" answered the stranger, "thy fall hath set triple
                     bob-majors ringing in thine ears. Come on!"</p>
                  <p>The padre was only too glad to accept the explanation conveyed in this
                     discourteous answer. But he was destined for another singular experience. When
                     they had reached the summit of the eminence now known as Russian Hill, an
                     exclamation again burst from the padre. The stranger turned to his companion
                     with an impatient gesture; but the padre heeded him not. The view that burst
                     upon his sight was such as might well have engrossed the attention of a more
                     enthusiastic nature. The fog had not yet reached the hill, and the long valleys
                     and hillsides of the embarcadero below were glittering with the light of a
                     populous city. "Look!" said the padre, stretching his hand over the spreading
                     landscape. "Look, dost thou not see the stately squares and brilliantly-lighted
                     avenues of a mighty metropolis. Dost thou not see, as it were, another
                     firmament below?"</p>
                  <p>"Avast heaving, reverend man, and quit this folly," said the stranger, dragging
                     the bewildered padre after him. "Behold rather the stars knocked out of thy
                     hollow noddle by the fall thou hast had. Prithee, get over thy visions and
                     rhapsodies, for the time is nearing apace."</p>
                  <p>The padre humbly followed without another word. Descending the hill toward the
                     north, the stranger leading the way, in a few moments the padre detected the
                     wash of waves, and presently his feet struck the firmer sand of the beach. Here
                     the stranger paused, and the padre perceived a boat lying in readiness hard by.
                     As he stepped into the stern-sheets, in obedience to the command of his
                     companion, he noticed that the rowers seemed to partake of the misty
                     incorporeal texture of his companion, a similarity that became the more
                     distressing when he also perceived that their oars in pulling together made no
                     noise. The stranger, assuming the helm, guided the boat on quietly, while the
                     fog, settling over the face of the water and closing around them, seemed to
                     interpose a muffled wall between themselves and the rude jarring of the outer
                     world. As they pushed further into this penetralia, the padre listened
                     anxiously for the sound of creaking blocks and the rattling of cordage, but no
                     vibration broke the veiled stillness or disturbed the warm breath of the fleecy
                     fog. Only one incident occurred to break the monotony of their mysterious
                     journey. A one-eyed rower, who sat in front of the padre, catching the devout
                     father's eye, immediately grinned such a ghastly<pb n="264-265"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000138"/> smile, and winked his remaining eye with such
                     diabolical intensity of meaning that the padre was constrained to utter a pious
                     ejaculation, which had the disastrous effect of causing the marine Cocles to
                     "catch a crab," throwing his heels in the air and his head into the bottom of
                     the boat. But even this accident did not disturb the gravity of the rest of the
                     ghastly boat's crew.</p>
                  <p>When, as it seemed to the padre, ten minutes had elapsed, the outline of a
                     large ship loomed up directly across their bow. Before he could utter the cry
                     of warning that rose to his lips, or brace himself against the expected shock,
                     the boat passed gently and noiselessly through the sides of the vessel, and the
                     holy man found himself standing on the berth deck of what seemed to be an
                     ancient caravel. The boat and boat's crew had vanished. Only his mysterious
                     friend, the stranger, remained. By the light of a swinging lamp the padre
                     beheld him standing beside a hammock, whereon, apparently, lay the dying man to
                     whom he had been so mysteriously summoned. As the padre, in obedience to a sign
                     from his companion, stepped to the side of the sufferer, he feebly opened his
                     eyes and thus addressed him:</p>
                  <p>"Thou seest before thee, reverend father, a helpless mortal, struggling not
                     only with the last agonies of the flesh, but beaten down and tossed with sore
                     anguish of the spirit. It matters little when or how I became what thou now
                     seest me. Enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful, and that my only
                     hope of thy absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast
                     importance to the holy Church, and affects greatly her power, wealth and
                     dominion on these shores. But the terms of this secret and the conditions of my
                     absolution are peculiar. I have but five minutes to live. In that time I must
                     receive the extreme unction of the Church."</p>
                  <p>"And thy secret?" said the holy father.</p>
                  <p>"Shall be told afterwards," answered the dying man. "Come, my time is short.
                     Shrive me quickly."</p>
                  <p>The padre hesitated. "Couldst thou not tell this secret first?"</p>
                  <p>"Impossible!" said the dying man, with what seemed to the padre a momentary
                     gleam of triumph. Then as his breath grew feebler he called impatiently,
                     "shrive me! shrive me!"</p>
                  <p>"Let me know at least what this secret concerns?" suggested the padre,
                     insinuatingly.</p>
                  <p>"Shrive me first," said the dying man.</p>
                  <p>But the priest still hesitated, parleying with the sufferer until the ship's
                     bell struck, when, with a triumphant, mocking laugh from the stranger, the
                     vessel suddenly fell to pieces, amid the rushing of waters which at once
                     involved the dying man, the priest, and the mysterious stranger.</p>
                  <p>The padre did not recover his consciousness until high noon the next day, when
                     he found himself lying in a little hollow between the Mission Hills, and his
                     faithful mule a few paces from him, cropping the sparse herbage. The padre made
                     the best of his way home, but wisely abstained from narrating the facts<pb
                        n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6642-00000139"/> mentioned above, until after the
                     discovery of gold, when the whole of this veracious incident was related, with
                     the assertion of the padre that the secret which was thus mysteriously snatched
                     from his possession was nothing more than the discovery of gold, years since,
                     by the runaway sailors from the expedition of Sir Francis Drake.</p>

                  <head>THE LEGEND OF DEVIL'S POINT.</head>
                  <p>ON the northerly shore of San Francisco Bay, at a point where the Golden Gate
                     broadens into the Pacific stands a bluff promontory. It affords shelter from
                     the prevailing winds to a semicircular bay on the East. Around this bay the
                     hillside is bleak and barren, but there are traces of former habitation in a
                     weather-beaten cabin and deserted corral. It is said that these were originally
                     built by an enterprising squatter, who for some unaccountable reason abandoned
                     them shortly after. The "Jumper" who succeeded him disappeared one day, quite
                     mysteriously. The third tenant, who seemed to be a man of sanguine, hopeful
                     temperament, divided the property into building lots, staked off the hill-side,
                     and projected the map of a new metropolis. Failing, however, to convince the
                     citizens of San Francisco that they had mistaken the site of their city, he
                     presently fell into dissipation and despondency. He was frequently<pb
                        n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6642-00000140"/> quently observed haunting the narrow
                     strip of beach at low tide, or perched upon the cliff at highwater. In the
                     latter position a sheep-tender one day found him, cold and pulseless, with a
                     map of his property in his hand, and his face turned toward the distant
                     sea.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps these circumstances gave the locality its infelicitous reputation.
                     Vague rumors were bruited of a supernatural influence that had been exercised
                     on the tenants. Strange stories were circulated of the origin of the diabolical
                     title by which the promontory was known. By some it was believed to be haunted
                     by the spirit of one of Sir Francis Drake's sailors who had deserted his ship
                     in consequence of stories told by the Indians of gold discoveries, but who had
                     perished by starvation on the rocks. A <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >vaquero</foreign> who had once passed a night in the ruined cabin, related
                     how a strangely-dressed and emaciated figure had knocked at the door at
                     midnight and demanded food. Other story-tellers, of more historical accuracy,
                     roundly asserted that Sir Francis himself had been little better than a pirate,
                     and had chosen this spot to conceal quantities of ill-gotten booty, taken from
                     neutral bottoms, and had protected his hiding-place by the orthodox means of
                     hellish incantation and diabolic agencies. On moonlight nights a shadowy ship
                     was sometimes seen standing off-and-on, or when fogs encompassed sea and shore,
                     the noise of oars rising and falling in their row-locks could be heard muffled
                     and indistinctly during the night. Whatever foundation there might have been
                     for these stories, it was certain that a more weird and desolate-looking spot
                     could not have been selected for their theatre. High hills, verdureless and
                     enfiladed with dark cañadas, cast their gaunt shadows on the tide. During a
                     greater portion of the day the wind, which blew furiously and incessantly,
                     seemed possessed with a spirit of fierce disquiet and unrest. Toward nightfall
                     the sea-fog crept with soft step through the portals of the Golden Gate, or
                     stole in noiseless marches down the hillside, tenderly soothing the
                     wind-buffeted face of the cliff, until sea and sky were hid together. At such
                     times the populous city beyond and the nearer settlement seemed removed to an
                     infinite distance. An immeasurable loneliness settled upon the cliff. The
                     creaking of a windlass, or the monotonous chant of sailors on some unseen,
                     outlying ship, came faint and far, and full of mystic suggestion.</p>
                  <p>About a year ago, a well-to-do middle-aged broker of San Francisco found
                     himself at night-fall the sole occupant of a "plunger," encompassed in a dense
                     fog, and drifting toward the Golden Gate. This unexpected termination of an
                     afternoon's sail was partly attributable to his want of nautical skill, and
                     partly to the effect of his usually sanguine nature. Having given up the
                     guidance of his boat to the wind and tide, he had trusted too implicitly for
                     that reaction which his business experience assured him was certain to occur in
                     all affairs, aquatic as well as terrestrial. "The tide will turn soon," said
                     the broker, confidently, "or something will happen." He had<pb n="270-271"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000141"/> scarcely settled himself back again in the
                     stern-sheets, before the bow of the plunger, obeying some mysterious impulse,
                     veered slowly around and a dark object loomed up before him. A gentle eddy
                     carried the boat further in-shore, until at last it was completely embayed
                     under the lee of a rocky point now faintly discernible through the fog. He
                     looked around him in the vain hope of recognizing some familiar headland. The
                     tops of the high hills which rose on either side were hidden in the fog. As the
                     boat swung around, he succeeded in fastening a line to the rocks, and sat down
                     again with a feeling of renewed confidence and security.</p>
                  <p>It was very cold. The insidious fog penetrated his tightly-buttoned coat, and
                     set his teeth to chattering in spite of the aid he sometimes drew from a
                     pocket-flask. His clothes were wet and the stern-sheets were covered with
                     spray. The comforts of fire and shelter continually rose before his fancy as he
                     gazed wistfully on the rocks. In sheer despair he finally drew the boat toward
                     the most accessible part of the cliff and essayed to ascend. This was less
                     difficult than it appeared, and in a few moments he had gained the hill above.
                     A dark object at a little distance attracted his attention, and on approaching
                     it proved to be a deserted cabin. The story goes on to say, that having built a
                     roaring fire of stakes pulled from the adjoining <foreign xml:lang="SPA"
                        >corral,</foreign> with the aid of a flask of excellent brandy, he managed
                     to pass the early part of the evening with comparative comfort.</p>
                  <p>There was no door in the cabin, and the windows were simply square openings,
                     which freely admitted the searching fog. But in spite of these
                     discomforts—being a man of cheerful, sanguine temperament—he amused himself by
                     poking the fire, and watching the ruddy glow which the flames threw on the fog
                     from the open door. In this innocent occupation a great weariness overcame him
                     and he fell asleep.</p>
                  <p>He was awakened at midnight by a loud "halloo," which seemed to proceed
                     directly from the sea. Thinking it might be the cry of some boatman lost in the
                     fog, he walked to the edge of the cliff, but the thick veil that covered sea
                     and land rendered all objects at the distance of a few feet indistinguishable.
                     He heard, however, the regular strokes of oars rising and falling on the water.
                     The halloo was repeated. He was clearing his throat to reply, when to his
                     surprise an answer came apparently from the very cabin he had quitted. Hastily
                     retracing his steps, he was the more amazed, on reaching the open door, to find
                     a stranger warming himself by the fire. Stepping back far enough to conceal his
                     own person, he took a good look at the intruder.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of about forty, with a cadaverous face. But the oddity of his
                     dress attracted the broker's attention more than his lugubrious physiognomy.
                     His legs were hid in enormously wide trowsers descending to his knee, where
                     they met long boots of sealskin. A pea jacket with exaggerated cuffs, almost as
                     large as the breeches, covered his chest, and around his waist a monstrous
                     belt, with a buckle like a dentist's sign, supported two trumpet-mouthed
                        pistols<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6642-00000142"/> tols and a curved hanger.
                     He wore a long queue which depended half way down his back. As the fire-light
                     fell on his ingenuous countenance the broker observed with some concern that
                     this queue was formed entirely of a kind of tobacco, known as pigtail or twist.
                     Its effect, the broker remarked, was much heightened when in a moment of
                     thoughtful abstraction the apparition bit off a portion of it, and rolled it as
                     a quid into the cavernous recesses of his jaws.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the nearer splash of oars indicated the approach of the unseen boat.
                     The broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a number
                     of uncouth-looking figures clambered up the hill towards the ruined rendezvous.
                     They were dressed like the previous comer, who, as they passed through the open
                     door, exchanged greetings with each in antique phraseology, bestowing at the
                     same time some familiar nickname. Flash-in-the-Pan, Spitter-of-Frogs, Malmsey
                     Butt, Latheyard-Will, and Mark-the-Pinker, were the few <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >sobriquets</foreign> the broker remembered. Whether these titles were given
                     to express some peculiarity of their owner he could not tell, for a silence
                     followed as they slowly ranged themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a
                     semi-circle around their cadaverous host.</p>
                  <p>At length Malmsey Butt, a spherical-bodied man-of-war's-man with a rubicund
                     nose, got on his legs somewhat unsteadily, and addressed himself to the
                     company. They had met that evening, said the speaker, in accordance with a
                     time-honored custom. This was simply to relieve that one of their number who
                     for fifty years had kept watch and ward over the locality where certain
                     treasures had been buried. At this point the broker pricked up his ears. "If so
                     be, camarados and brothers all," he continued, "ye are ready to receive the
                     report of our excellent and well-beloved brother, Master Slit-the-Weazand,
                     touching his search for this treasure, why, marry, to't and begin.'</p>
                  <p>A murmur of assent went around the circle as the speaker resumed his seat.
                     Master Slit-the-Weazand slowly opened his lantern jaws, then began. He had
                     spent much of his time in determining the exact location of the treasure. He
                     believed—nay, he could state positively—that its position was now settled. It
                     was true he had done some trifling little business outside. Modesty forbade his
                     mentioning the particulars, but he would simply state that of the three tenants
                     who had occupied the cabin during the past ten years, none were now alive.
                     [Applause, and cries of "Go to! thou wast always a tall fellow!" and the
                     like.]</p>
                  <p>Mark-the-Pinker next arose. Before proceeding to business, he had a duty to
                     perform in the sacred name of Friendship. It ill became him to pass an eulogy
                     upon the qualities of the speaker who had preceded him, for he had known him
                     from "boyhood's hour." Side by side they had wrought together in the Spanish
                     war. For a neat hand with a toledo he challenged his equal, while how nobly and
                     beautifully he had won his present title of Slit-the-Weazand, all could
                     testify. The speaker, with some<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6642-00000143"/> show
                     of emotion, asked to be pardoned if he dwelt too freely on passages of their
                     early companionship; he then detailed, with a fine touch of humor, his
                     comrade's peculiar manner of slitting the ears and lips of a refractory Jew,
                     who had been captured in one of their previous voyages. He would not weary the
                     patience of his hearers, but would briefly propose that the report of
                     Slit-the-Weazand be accepted, and that the thanks of the company be tendered
                     him.</p>
                  <p>A breaker of strong spirits was then rolled into the hut, and cans of grog were
                     circulated freely from hand to hand. The health of Slit-the-Weazand was
                     proposed in a neat speech by Mark-the-Pinker, and responded to by the former
                     gentleman in a manner that drew tears to the eyes of all present. To the
                     broker, in his concealment, this momentary diversion from the real business of
                     the meeting, occasioned much anxiety. As yet nothing had been said to indicate
                     the exact locality of the treasure to which they had mysteriously alluded. Fear
                     restrained him from open inquiry, and curiosity kept him from making good his
                     escape during the orgies which followed.</p>
                  <p>But his situation was beginning to become critical. Flash-in-the-Pan, who
                     seemed to have been a man of choleric humor, taking fire during some
                     hotly-contested argument, discharged both his pistols at the breast of his
                     opponent. The balls passed through on each side immediately below his arm-pits,
                     making a clean hole, through which the horrified broker could see the
                     fire-light behind him. The wounded man, without betraying any concern, excited
                     the laughter of the company, by jocosely putting his arms akimbo, and inserting
                     his thumbs into the orifices of the wounds, as if they had been arm-holes. This
                     having in a measure restored good humor, the party joined hands and formed a
                     circle preparatory to dancing. The dance was commenced by some monotonous
                     stanzas hummed in a very high key by one of the party, the rest joining in the
                     following chorus, which seemed to present a familiar sound to the broker's ear. <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Her Majestie is very sicke,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>At the regular recurrence of the last line, the party discharged their loaded
                     pistols in all directions, rendering the position of the unhappy broker one of

                  <p>When the tumult had partially subsided, Flash-in-the-Pan called the meeting to
                     order, and most of the revelers returned to their places, Malmsey Butt,
                     however, insisting upon another chorus, and singing at the top of his voice: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"I am ycleped J. Keyser—I was born at Spring, hys Garden,</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Flash-in-the-Pan drew a pistol from his belt, and bidding some one gag Malmsey
                     Butt with the stock of it, proceeded to read from a portentous roll of
                     parchment that he held in his hand. It was a semi-legal<pb n="276-277"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000144"/> legal document, clothed in the quaint
                     phraseology of a by-gone period. After a long preamble, asserting their loyalty
                     as lieges of Her most bountiful Majesty and Sovereign Lady the Queen, the
                     document declared that they then and there took possession of the promontory,
                     and all the treasure trove therein contained, formerly buried by Her Majesty's
                     most faithful and devoted Admiral, Sir Francis Drake, with the right to search,
                     discover and appropriate the same; and for the purpose thereof they did then
                     and there form a guild or corporation to so discover, search for and disclose
                     said treasures, and by virtue thereof they solemnly subscribed their names. But
                     at this moment the reading of the parchment was arrested by an exclamation from
                     the assembly, and the broker was seen frantically struggling at the door in the
                     strong arms of Mark-the-Pinker.</p>
                  <p>"Let me go!" he cried as he made a desperate attempt to reach the side of
                     Master Flash-in-the-Pan. "Let me go! I tell you, gentlemen, that document is
                     not worth the parchment it is written on. The laws of the State—the customs of
                     the country—the mining ordinances—are all against it. Don't, by all that's
                     sacred, throw away such a capital investment through ignorance and informality.
                     Let me go! I assure you, gentlemen, professionally, that you have a big thing—a
                     remarkably big thing, and even if I ain't in it, I'm not going to see it fall
                     through. Don't, for God's sake, gentlemen, I implore you, put your names to
                     such a ridiculous paper. There isn't a notary——"</p>
                  <p>He ceased. The figures around him, which were beginning to grow fainter and
                     more indistinct, as he went on, swam before his eyes, flickered, re-appeared
                     again, and finally went out. He rubbed his eyes and gazed around him. The cabin
                     was deserted. On the hearth the red embers of his fire were fading away in the
                     bright beams of the morning sun, that looked aslant through the open window. He
                     ran out to the cliff. The sturdy sea-breeze fanned his feverish cheeks, and
                     tossed the white caps of waves that beat in pleasant music on the beach below.
                     A stately merchantman with snowy canvas was entering the Gate. The voices of
                     sailors came cheerfully from a bark at anchor below the point. The muskets of
                     the sentries gleamed brightly on Alcatraz, and the rolling of drums swelled on
                     the breeze. Farther on, the hills of San Francisco, cottage-crowned and
                     bordered with wharves and warehouses, met his longing eye.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Legend of Devil's Point. Any objections to its reliability may be
                     met with the statement that the broker who tells the story has since
                     incorporated a company under the title of "Flash-in-the Pan Gold and Silver
                     Treasure Mining Company," and that its shares are already held at a stiff
                     figure. A copy of the original document is said to be on record in the office
                     of the company, and on any clear day, the locality of the claim may be
                     distinctly seen from the hills of San Francisco.</p>

                  <head>THE DEVIL AND THE BROKER.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A MEDIÆVAL LEGEND.</head>
                  <p>THE church clocks in San Francisco were striking ten. The Devil, who had been
                     flying over the city that evening, just then alighted on the roof of a church
                     near the corner of Bush and Montgomery streets. It will be perceived that the
                     popular belief that the Devil avoids holy edifices, and vanishes at the sound
                     of a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Credo</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >Paternoster,</foreign> is long since exploded. Indeed, modern skepticism
                     asserts that he is not averse to these orthodox discourses, which particularly
                     bear reference to himself, and in a measure recognize his power and
                     importance.</p>
                  <p>I am inclined to think, however, that his choice of a resting-place was a good
                     deal influenced by its contiguity to a populous thoroughfare. When he was
                     comfortably seated he began pulling out the joints of a small rod which he held
                     in his hand, and which presently proved to be an extraordinary fishing-pole,
                     with a telescopic adjustment that permitted its protraction to a marvelous
                     extent. Affixing a line thereto, he selected a fly of a particular pattern from
                     a small box which he carried with him, and, making a skillful cast, threw his
                     line into the very centre of that living stream which ebbed and flowed through
                     Montgomery Street.</p>
                  <p>Either the people were very virtuous that evening or the bait was not a taking
                     one. In vain the Devil whipped the stream at an eddy in front of the
                     Occidental, or trolled his line into the shadows of the Cosmopolitan; five
                     minutes passed without even a nibble. "Dear me!" quoth the Devil, "that's very
                     singular; one of my most popular flies, too! Why, they'd have risen by shoals
                     in Broadway or Beacon street, for that. Well, here goes another," and, fitting
                     a new fly from his well filled box, he gracefully recast his line.</p>
                  <p>For a few moments there was every prospect of sport. The line was continually
                     bobbing and the nibbles were distinct and gratifying. Once or twice the bait
                     was apparently gorged and carried off in the upper stories of the hotels to be
                     digested at leisure. At such times the professional manner in which the Devil
                     played out his line would have thrilled the heart of Izaak Walton. But his
                     efforts were unsuccessful; the bait was invariably carried off without hooking
                     the victim, and the Devil finally lost his temper. "I've heard of these San
                     Franciscans before," he muttered; "wait till I get hold of one—that's all!" he
                     added malevolently, as he re-baited his hook. A sharp tug and a wriggle folled
                     his next trial, and finally, with considerable effort, he landed a portly
                     200-lb. broker upon the church roof.</p>

                  <p>As the victim lay there gasping, it was evident that the Devil was in no hurry
                     to remove the hook from his gills; nor did he exhibit in this delicate
                     operation that courtesy of manner and graceful manipulation which usually
                     distinguished him.</p>
                  <p>"Come," he said gruffly, as he grasped the broker by the waistband, "quit that
                     whining and grunting. Don't flatter yourself that you're a prize, either. I was
                     certain to have had you. It was only a question of time."</p>
                  <p>"It is not that, my lord, which troubles me," whined the unfortunate wretch, as
                     he painfully wriggled his head, "but that I should have been fooled by such a
                     paltry bait. What will they say of me down there? To have let 'bigger things'
                     go by, and to be taken in by this cheap trick," he added, as he groaned and
                     glanced at the fly which the Devil was carefully re-arranging, "is what—pardon
                     me, my lord—is what gets me!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the Devil, philosophically, "I never caught anybody yet who didn't
                     say that; but tell me, ain't you getting somewhat fastidious down there? Here
                     is one of my most popular flies, the greenback," he continued, exhibiting an
                     emerald looking insect, which he drew from his box. "This, so generally
                     considered excellent in election season, has not even been nibbled at. Perhaps
                     your sagacity, which, in spite of this unfortunate <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >contretemps,</foreign> no one can doubt," added the Devil, with a graceful
                     return to his usual courtesy, "may explain the reason or suggest a
                     substitute."</p>
                  <p>The broker glanced at the contents of the box with a supercilious smile. "Too
                     old-fashioned, my lord—long ago played out." "Yet," he added, with a gleam of
                     interest, "for a consideration I might offer something—ahem!—that would make a
                     taking substitute for these trifles. Give me," he continued, in a brisk,
                     business-like way, "a slight percentage and a bonus down, and I'm your
                     man."</p>
                  <p>"Name your terms," said the Devil earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"My liberty and a percentage on all you take, and the thing's done."</p>
                  <p>The Devil caressed his tail thoughtfully, for a few moments. He was certain of
                     the broker any way—and the risk was slight. "Done!" he said.</p>
                  <p>"Stay a moment," said the artful broker. "There are certain contingencies. Give
                     me your fishing rod and let me apply the bait myself. It requires a skillful
                     hand, my lord; even your well-known experience might fail. Leave me alone for
                     half an hour, and if you have reason to complain of my success I will forfeit
                     my deposit—I mean my liberty."</p>
                  <p>The Devil acceded to his request, bowed and withdrew. Alighting gracefully in
                     Montgomery Street, he dropped into Meade &amp; Co.'s clothing store, where,
                     having completely equipped himself à <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la mode,</foreign>
                     he sallied forth intent on his personal enjoyment. Determining to sink his
                     professional character, he mingled with the current of human life, and enjoyed,
                     with that immense capacity for excitement peculiar to his nature, the whirl,
                     bustle and feverishness of the people, as a<pb n="282-283"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000147"/> purely æsthetic gratification unalloyed by the
                     cares of business. What he did that evening does not belong to our story. We
                     return to the broker, whom we left on the roof.</p>
                  <p>When he made sure that the Devil had retired, he carefully drew from his
                     pocket-book a slip of paper and affixed it on the hook. The line had scarcely
                     reached the current before he felt a bite. The hook was swallowed. To bring up
                     his victim rapidly, disengage him from the hook and re-set his line was the
                     work of a moment. Another bite and the same result. Another, and another. In a
                     very few minutes the roof was covered with his panting spoil. The broker could
                     himself distinguish that many of them were personal friends—nay, some of them
                     were familiar frequenters of the building on which they were now miserably
                     stranded. That the broker felt a certain satisfaction in being instrumental in
                     thus misleading his fellow-brokers no one acquainted with human nature will for
                     a moment doubt. But a stronger pull on his line caused him to put forth all his
                     strength and skill. The magic pole bent like a coach-whip. The broker held
                     firm, assisted by the battlements of the church. Again and again it was almost
                     wrested from his hand, and again again he slowly reeled in a portion of the
                     tightening line. At last, with one mighty effort, he lifted to the level of the
                     roof a struggling object. A howl like Pandemonium rang through the air as the
                     broker successfully landed at his feet—the Devil himself!</p>
                  <p>The two glared fiercely at each other. The broker, perhaps mindful of his
                     former treatment, evinced no haste to remove the hook from his antagonist's
                     jaw. When it was finally accomplished, he asked quietly if the Devil was
                     satisfied. That gentleman seemed absorbed in the contemplation of the bait
                     which he had just taken from his mouth. "I am," he said, finally, "and forgive
                     you—but what do you call this?"</p>
                  <p>"Bend low," replied the Broker, as he <choice>

                     </choice> up his coat ready to depart. The Devil inclined his ear. "I call it

                  <head>THE OGRESS OF SILVER LAND;</head>
                  <head type="sub">OR, THE DIVERTING HISTORY OF PRINCE BADFELLAH AND PRINCE
                     BULLEBOYE.</head>
                  <p>IN the second year of the reign of the renowned Caliph Lo there dwelt in SILVER
                     LAND, adjoining his territory, a certain terrible ogress. She lived in the
                     bowels of a dismal mountain, where she was in the habit of confining such
                     unfortunate travelers as ventured within her domain. The country for miles
                     around was sterile and barren. In some places it was covered with a white
                     powder, which was called in the language of the country AL KA LI, and was
                     supposed to be the pulverized bones of those who had perished miserably in her
                     service.</p>
                  <p>In spite of this, every year, great numbers of young men devoted themselves to
                     the service of the ogress, hoping to become her godsons, and to enjoy the good
                     fortune which belonged to that privileged class. For these godsons had no work
                     to perform, neither at the mountain nor elsewhere, but roamed about the world
                     with credentials of their relationship in their pockets, which they called
                     STOKH, which was stamped with the stamp and sealed with the seal of ogress, and
                     which enabled them at the end of each moon to draw large quantities of gold and
                     silver from her treasury. And the wisest and most favored of those godsons were
                     the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE. They knew all the secrets of the ogress,
                     and how to wheedle and coax her. They were also the favorites of SOOPAH
                     INTENDENT, who was her Lord High Chamberlain and Prime Minister, and who dwelt
                     in SILVER LAND.</p>
                  <p>One day, SOOPAH INTENDENT said to his servants, "What is that which travels the
                     most surely, the most secretly, and the most swiftly?"</p>
                  <p>And they all answered as one man, "LIGHTNING, my Lord, travels the most surely,
                     the most swiftly and the most secretly!"</p>
                  <p>Then said SOOPAH INTENDENT, "Let lightning carry this message secretly, swiftly
                     and surely to my beloved friends the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE, and tell
                     them that their godmother is dying, and bid them seek some other godmother or
                     sell their STOKH ere it becomes <hi rend="i"/>badjee—worthless."</p>
                  <p>"Bekhesm! On our heads be it!" answered the servants; and they ran to Lightning
                     with the message, who flew with it to the City by the Sea, and delivered it,
                     even at that moment, into the hands of the Princes BADFELLAH and BULLEBOYE.</p>
                  <p>Now the Prince BADFELLAH was a wicked young man, and when he had received this
                     message he tore his beard and rent his garment and reviled his godmother, and
                     his friend SOOPAH INTENDENT. But<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6642-00000149"/>
                     presently he arose, and dressed himself in his finest stuffs, and went forth
                     into the Bazaars and among the merchants, capering and dancing as he walked,
                     and crying in a loud voice, "Oh, happy day—oh, day worthy to be marked with a
                     white stone!"</p>
                  <p>This he said cunningly, thinking the merchants and men of the bazaars would
                     gather about him, which they presently did, and began to question him: "What
                     news, O most worthy and serene Highness? Tell us, that we make merry, too!"</p>
                  <p>Then replied the cunning prince, "Good news, O my brothers, for I have heard
                     this day that my godmother in SILVER LAND is well." The merchants who were not
                     aware of the substance of the real message, envied him greatly, and said one to
                     another: "Surely our brother the Prince BADFELLAH is favored by Allah above all
                     men;" and they were about to retire, when the prince checked them, saying:
                     "Tarry for a moment. Here are my credentials or STOKH. The same I will sell you
                     for fifty thousand sequins, for I have to give a feast to-day, and need much
                     gold. Who will give fifty thousand?" And he again fell to capering and dancing.
                     But this time the merchants drew a little apart, and some of the oldest and
                     wisest said: "What dirt is this which the prince would have us swallow. If his
                     godmother were well, why should he sell his STOKH. Bismillah! The olives are
                     old and the jar is broken!" When Prince BADFELLAH perceived them whispering,
                     his countenance fell, and his knees smote against each other through fear; but
                     dissembling again, he said: "Well, so be it! Lo, I have much more than shall
                     abide with me, for my days are many and my wants are few. Say forty thousand
                     sequins for my STOKH and let me depart in Allah's name. Who will give forty
                     thousand sequins to become the godson of such a healthy mother?" And he again
                     fell to capering and dancing, but not as gaily as before, for his heart was
                     troubled. The merchants, however, only moved farther away. "Thirty thousand
                     sequins," cried Prince BADFELLAH; but even as he spoke they fled before his
                     face crying: "His godmother is dead. Lo, the jackals are defiling her grave.
                     Mashalla! he has no godmother." And they sought out PANIK, the swift-footed
                     messenger, and bade him shout through the bazaars that the godmother of PRINCE
                     BADFELLAH was dead. When he heard this, the prince fell upon his face, and rent
                     his garments, and covered himself with the dust of the market place. As he was
                     sitting thus, a porter passed him with jars of wine on his shoulders, and the
                     prince begged him to give him a jar, for he was exceeding thirsty and faint.
                     But the porter said, "What will my lord give me first?" And the prince, in very
                     bitterness of spirit, said, "Take this," and handed him his STOKH and so
                     exchanged it for a jar of wine.</p>
                  <p>Now the Prince BULLEBOYE was of a very different disposition. When he <choice>
                        <sic>recieved</sic>
                        <corr>received</corr>
                     </choice> the message of SOOPAH INTENDENT he bowed his head, and said, "It is
                     the will of God." Then he rose, and without speaking a word entered the gates
                     of his palace. But his wife, the peerless MAREE JAHANN, perceiving the<pb
                        n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6642-00000150"/> gravity of his countenance, said,
                     "Why is my lord cast down and silent? Why are those rare and priceless pearls,
                     his words, shut up so tightly between those gorgeous oyster shells, his lips?"
                     But to this he made no reply. Thinking further to divert him, she brought her
                     lute into the chamber and stood before him, and sang the song and danced the
                     dance of BEN KOTTON, which is called IBRAHIM'S DAUGHTER, but she could not lift
                     the veil of sadness from his brow.</p>
                  <p>When she had ceased, the Prince BULLEBOYE arose and said, "Allah is great, and
                     what am I, his servant, but the dust of the earth! Lo, this day has my
                     godmother sickened unto death, and my STOKH become as a withered palm leaf.
                     Call hither my servants and camel drivers, and the merchants that have
                     furnished me with stuffs, and the beggars who have feasted at my table, and bid
                     them take all that is here, for it is mine no longer!' With these words he
                     buried his face in his mantle and wept aloud.</p>
                  <p>But MAREE JAHANN, his wife, plucked him by the sleeve: "Prithee, my lord," said
                     she, "bethink thee of the BROKAH or scrivener, who besought thee but yesterday
                     to share thy STOKH with him and gave thee his bond for fifty thousand sequins?"
                     But the noble Prince BULLEBOYE, raising his head, said: "Shall I sell to him
                     for fifty thousand sequins that which I know is not worth a SOO MARKEE. For is
                     not all the BROKAH'S wealth—even his wife and children, pledged on that bond?
                     Shall I ruin him to save myself? Allah forbid! Rather let me eat the salt fish
                     of honest penury, than the kibobs of dishonorable affluence: rather let me
                     wallow in the mire of virtuous oblivion, than repose on the divan of luxurious
                     wickedness."</p>
                  <p>When the prince had given utterance to this beautiful and edifying sentiment a
                     strain of gentle music was heard, and the rear wall of the apartment, which had
                     been ingeniously constructed like a flat, opened and discovered the Ogress of
                     SILVER LAND in the glare of blue fire, seated on a triumphal car attached to
                     two ropes which were connected with the flies, in the very act of blessing the
                     unconscious prince. When the walls closed again without attracting his
                     attention, Prince BULLEBOYE arose, dressed himself in his coarsest and cheapest
                     stuffs, and sprinkled ashes on his head, and in this guise, having embraced his
                     wife, went forth into the bazaars. In this it will be perceived how differently
                     the good Prince BULLEBOYE acted from the wicked Prince BADFELLAH, who put on
                     his gayest garments to simulate and deceive.</p>
                  <p>Now when Prince BULLEBOYE entered the chief bazaar, where the merchants of the
                     city were gathered in council, he stood up in his accustomed place, and all
                     that were there held their breath, for the noble Prince BULLEBOYE was much
                     respected. "Let the BROKAH, whose bond I hold for fifty thousand sequins, stand
                     forth!" said the prince. And the BROKAH stood forth from among the merchants.
                     Then said the prince: "Here is thy bond for fifty thousand sequins, for which I
                     was to deliver unto thee one-half of my STOKH. Know, then, O my<pb n="290-291"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000151"/> brother—and thou, too, O Aga of the BROKAHS—that
                     this my STOKH which I pledged to thee is worthless. For my godmother, the
                     Ogress of SILVER LAND, is dying. Thus do I release thee from thy bond, and from
                     the poverty which might overtake thee as it has even me, thy brother, the
                     Prince BULLEBOYE." And with that the noble Prince BULLEBOYE tore the bond of
                     the BROKAH into pieces and scattered it to the four winds.</p>
                  <p>Now when the prince tore up the bond there was a great commotion, and some
                     said: "Surely the Prince BULLEBOYE is drunken with wine;" and others: "He is
                     possessed of an evil spirit;" and his friends expostulated with him, saying:
                     "What thou hast done is not the custom of the bazaars—behold, it is not BIZ!"
                     But to all the prince answered gravely: "It is right—on my own head be it!"</p>
                  <p>But the oldest and wisest of the merchants, they who had talked with Prince
                     BADFELLAH the same morning, whispered together, and gathered around the BROKAH
                     whose bond the Prince BULLEBOYE had torn up. "Hark ye," said they, "our brother
                     the Prince BULLEBOYE is cunning as a jackal. What bosh is this about ruining
                     himself to save thee? Such a thing was never heard before in the bazaars. It is
                     a trick, O thou mooncalf of a BROKAH! Dost thou not see that he has heard good
                     news from his godmother, the same that was even now told us by the Prince
                     BADFELLAH, his confederate, and that he would destroy thy bond for fifty
                     thousand sequins because his STOKH is worth a hundred thousand! Be not
                     deceived, O too credulous BROKAH! for this what our brother the prince doeth is
                     not in the name of ALLAH, but of BIZ, the only god known in the bazaars of the
                     city."</p>
                  <p>When the foolish BROKAH heard these things he cried: "Justice, O Aga of the
                     BROKAHS—justice and the fulfillment of my bond! Let the prince deliver unto me
                     the STOKH. Here are my fifty thousand sequins." But the prince said: "Have I
                     not told that my godmother is dying, and that my STOKH is valueless?" At this
                     the BROKAH only clamored the more for justice and the fulfillment of his bond.
                     Then the Aga of the BROKAHS said. "Since the bond is destroyed, behold thou
                     hast no claim. Go thy ways!" But the BROKAH again cried: "Justice, my lord Aga!
                     Behold, I offer the prince seventy thousand sequins for his STOKH!" But the
                     prince said: "It is not worth one sequin!" Then the Aga said: "Bismillah! I
                     cannot understand this. Whether thy godmother be dead, or dying, or immortal,
                     does not seem to signify. Therefore, O prince, by the laws of BIZ and of ALLAH,
                     thou art released. Give the BROKAH thy STOKH for seventy thousand sequins and
                     bid him depart in peace. On his own head be it!" When the prince heard this
                     command, he handed his STOKH to the BROKAH, who counted out to him seventy
                     thousand sequins. But the heart of the virtuous prince did not rejoice, nor did
                     the BROKAH, when he found his STOKH was valueless<pb n="292-293"
                        xml:id="VAC6642-00000152"/> but the merchants lifted their hands in wonder
                     at the sagacity and wisdom of the famous Prince BULLEBOYE. For none would
                     believe that it was the law of ALLAH that the prince followed, and not the
                     rules of BIZ.</p>

                  <head>THE RUINS OF SAN FRANCISCO.</head>
                  <p>TOWARDS the close of the 19th century the city of San Francisco was totally
                     engulfed by an earthquake. Although the whole coast line must have been much
                     shaken, the accident seems to have been purely local and even the city of
                     Oakland escaped. Schwappelfurt, the celebrated German geologist, has endeavored
                     to explain this singular fact by suggesting that there are some things the
                     earth cannot swallow—a statement that should be received with some caution, as
                     exceeding the latitude of ordinary geological speculation.</p>
                  <p>Historians disagree in the exact date of the calamity. Tulu Krish, the
                     well-known New Zealander, whose admirable speculations on the ruins of St. Paul
                     as seen from London Bridge have won for him the attentive consideration of the
                     scientific world, fixes the occurrence in A. D. 1880. This, supposing the city
                     to have been actually founded in 1850, as asserted, would give but thirty years
                     for it to have assumed the size and proportions it had evidently attained at
                     the time of its destruction. It is not our purpose, however, to question the
                     conclusions of the justly<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6642-00000153"/> famed
                     Maorian philosopher. Our present business lies with the excavations that are
                     now being prosecuted by order of the Hawaiian Government upon the site of the
                     lost city.</p>
                  <p>Every one is familiar with the story of its discovery. For many years the bay
                     of San Francisco had been famed for the luscious quality of its oysters. It is
                     stated that a dredger one day raked up a large bell, which prove to belong to
                     the City Hall, and led to the discovery of the cupola of that building. The
                     attention of the Government was at once directed to the spot. The bay of San
                     Francisco was speedily drained by a system of patent syphons, and the city,
                     deeply imbedded in mud, brought to light after a burial of many centuries. The
                     City Hall, Post Office, Mint and Custom House were readily recognized by the
                     large full-fed barnacles which adhered to their walls. Shortly afterwards the
                     first skeleton was discovered, that of a broker, whose position in the upper
                     strata of mud nearer the surface, was supposed to be owing to the exceeding
                     buoyancy or inflation of scrip which he had secured about his person while
                     endeavoring to escape. Many skeletons, supposed to be those of females,
                     encompassed in that peculiar steel coop or cage, which seems to have been worn
                     by the women of that period, were also found in the upper stratum. Alexis von
                     Puffer, in his admirable work on San Francisco, accounts for the position of
                     these unfortunate creatures, by asserting that the steel cage was originally
                     the frame of a parachute like garment which distended the skirt, and in the
                     submersion of the city prevented them from sinking. "If anything," says Von
                     Puffer, "could have been wanting to add intensity to the horrible catastrophe
                     which took place as the waters first entered the city, it would have been
                     furnished in the forcible separation of the sexes at this trying moment. Buoyed
                     up by their peculiar garments, the female population instantly ascended <choice>
                        <sic>to to</sic>
                        <corr>to</corr>
                     </choice> the surface. As the drowning husband turned his eyes above, what must
                     have been his agony as he saw his wife shooting upward, and knew that he was
                     debarred the privilege of perishing with her? To the lasting honor of the male
                     inhabitants, be it said that but few seem to have availed themselves of their
                     wives' superior levity. Only one skeleton was found still grasping the ankles
                     of another in their upward journey to the surface."</p>
                  <p>For many years California had been subject to slight earthquakes, more or less
                     generally felt, but not of sufficient importance to awaken anxiety or fear.
                     Perhaps the absorbing nature of the San Franciscans' pursuits of gold getting,
                     which metal seems to have been valuable in those days, and actually used as a
                     medium of currency, rendered the inhabitants reckless of all other matters.
                     Everything tends to show that the calamity was totally unlooked for. We quote
                     the graphic language of Schwappelfurt:</p>
                  <p>"The morning of the tremendous catastrophe probably dawned upon the usual
                     restless crowd of gold getters intent upon their several avocations. The
                     streets were filled with the expanded figures of gaily-dressed women,
                     acknowledging with coy glances the<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6642-00000154"/>
                     respectful salutations of beaux as they gracefully raised their remarkable
                     cylindrical head-coverings, a model of which is still preserved in the Honolulu
                     Museum. The brokers had gathered at their respective temples. The shopmen were
                     exhibiting their goods. The idlers, or 'Bummers'—a term applied to designate an
                     aristocratic, privileged class who enjoyed immunities from labor and from whom
                     a majority of the rulers are chosen—were listlessly regarding the promenaders
                     from the street corners or the doors of their bibulous temples. A slight
                     premonitory thrill runs through the city. The busy life of this restless
                     microcosm is arrested. The shopkeeper pauses as he elevates the goods to bring
                     them into a favorable light, and the glib professional recommendation sticks on
                     his tongue. In the drinking saloon the glass is checked half way to the lips;
                     on the streets the promenaders pause. Another thrill and the city begins to go
                     down a few of the more persistent topers tossing off their liquor at the same
                     moment. Beyond a terrible sensation of nausea, the crowds who now throng the
                     streets do not realize the extent of the catastrophe. The waters of the bay
                     recede at first from the centre of depression, assuming a concave shape, the
                     outer edge of the circle towering many thousand feet above the city. Another
                     convulsion, and the water instantly resumes its level. The city is smoothly
                     engulfed nine thousand feet below, and the regular swell of the Pacific calmly
                     rolls over it. Terrible," says Schwappelfurt, in conclusion, "as the calamity
                     must have been, in direct relation to the individuals immediately concerned
                     therein, we cannot but admire its artistic management; the division of the
                     catastrophe into three periods, the completeness of the cataclysms and the rare
                     combination of sincerity of intention with felicity of execution."</p>

                  <head>A NIGHT AT WINGDAM.</head>
                  <p>I HAD been stage-ridden and bewildered all day, and when we swept down with the
                     darkness into the Arcadian hamlet of "Wingdam," I resolved to go no further,
                     and rolled out in a gloomy and dyspeptic state. The effects of a mysterious
                     pie, and some sweetened carbonic acid known to the proprietor of the "Half Way
                     House" as "lemming sody," still oppressed me. Even the facetiæ of the gallant
                     expressman who knew everybody's christian name along the route, who rained
                     letters, newspapers and bundles from the top of the stage, whose legs
                     frequently appeared in frightful proximity to the wheels, who got on and off
                     while we were going at full speed, whose gallantry, energy and superior
                     knowledge of travel crushed all us other passengers to envious silence, and who
                     just then was talking with several persons and manifestly doing something else
                     at the same time—even this had failed to interest me. So I stood gloomily,
                     clutching my shawl and carpet bag, and watched the stage roll away, taking a
                     parting look at the gallant expressman as he hung on the top rail with one leg,
                     and lit his cigar from the pipe of a running footman. I then turned toward the
                     Wingdam Temperance Hotel.</p>
                  <p>It may have been the weather, or it may have been the pie, but I was not
                     impressed favorably with the house. Perhaps it was the name extending the whole
                     length of the building, with a letter under each window, making the people who
                     looked out dreadfully conspicuous. Perhaps it was that "Temperance" always
                     suggested to my mind, rusks and weak tea. It was uninviting. It might have been
                     called the "Total Abstinence" Hotel, from the lack of anything to intoxicate or
                     enthrall the senses. It was designed with an eye to artistic dreariness. It was
                     so much too large for the settlement, that it appeared to be a very slight
                     improvement on out-doors. It was unpleasantly new. There was the forest flavor
                     of dampness about it, and a slight spicing of pine. Nature outraged, but not
                     entirely subdued, sometimes broke out afresh in little round, sticky, resinous
                     tears on the doors and windows. It seemed to me that boarding there must seem
                     like a perpetual picnic. As I entered the door, a number of the regular
                     boarders rushed out of a long room, and set about trying to get the taste of
                     something out of their mouths, by the application of tobacco in various forms.
                     A few immediately ranged themselves around the fire-place, with their legs over
                     each other's chairs, and in that position silently resigned themselves to
                     indigestion. Remembering the pie, I waived the invitation of the landlord to
                     supper, but suffered myself to be conducted into the sitting-room. "Mine<pb
                        n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6642-00000156"/> host" was a magnificent looking,
                     heavily bearded specimen of the animal man. He reminded me of somebody or
                     something connected with the drama. I was sitting beside the fire, mutely
                     wondering what it could be, and trying to follow the particular chord of memory
                     thus touched, into the intricate past, when a little delicate-looking woman
                     appeared at the door, and leaning heavily against the casing, said in an
                     exhausted tone. "Husband!" As the landlord turned toward her, that particular
                     remembrance flashed before me, in a single line of blank verse. It was this:
                     "Two souls with but one single thought, two hearts that beat as one."</p>
                  <p>It was Ingomar and Parthenia his wife. I imagined a different denouement from
                     the play. Ingomar had taken Parthenia back to the mountains, and kept a hotel
                     for the benefit of the Alemanni, who resorted there in large numbers. Poor
                     Parthenia was pretty well fagged out, and did all the work without "help." She
                     had two "young barbarians," a boy and a girl. She was faded—but still good
                     looking.</p>
                  <p>I sat and talked with Ingomar, who seemed perfectly at home and told me several
                     stories of the Alemanni, all bearing a strong flavor of the wilderness, and
                     being perfectly in keeping with the house. How he, Ingomar, had killed a
                     certain dreadful "bar," whose skin was just up "yar," over his bed. How he,
                     Ingomar, had killed several "bucks," whose skins had been prettily fringed and
                     embroidered by Parthenia, and even now clothed him. How he, Ingomar, had killed
                     several "Injins," and was once nearly scalped himself. All this with that
                     ingenious candor which is perfectly justifiable in a barbarian, but which a
                     Greek might feel inclined to look upon as "blowing." Thinking of the wearied
                     Parthenia, I began to consider for the first time that perhaps she had better
                     married the old Greek. Then she would at least have always looked neat. Then
                     she would not have worn a woolen dress flavored with all the dinners of the
                     past year. Then she would not have been obliged to wait on the table with her
                     hair half down. Then the two children would not have hung about her skirts with
                     dirty fingers, palpably dragging her down day by day. I suppose it was the pie
                     which put such heartless and improper ideas in my head, and so I rose up and
                     told Ingomar I believed I'd go to bed. Preceded by that redoutable barbarian
                     and a flaring tallow candle, I followed him up stairs to my room. It was the
                     only single room he had, he told me; he had built it for the convenience of
                     married parties who might stop here, but that event not happening yet, he had
                     left it half furnished. It had cloth on one side, and large cracks on the
                     other. The wind, which always swept over Wingdam at night time, puffed through
                     the apartment from different apertures. The window was too small for the hole
                     in the side of the house where it hung, and rattled noisily. Everything looked
                     cheerless and dispiriting. Before Ingomar left me, he brought that "bar-skin,"
                     and throwing it over the solemn bier which stood in one corner, told me he
                     reckoned that<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6642-00000157"/> would keep me warm,
                     and then bade me good night. I undressed myself, the light blowing out in the
                     middle of that ceremony, crawled under the "bar-skin," and tried to compose
                     myself to sleep.</p>
                  <p>But I was staringly wide awake. I heard the wind sweep down the mountain side,
                     and toss the branches of the melancholy pine, and then enter the house, and try
                     all the doors along the passage. Sometimes strong currents of air blew my hair
                     all over the pillow, as with strange whispering breaths. The green timber along
                     the walls seemed to be sprouting, and sent a dampness even through the
                     bar-skin." I felt like Robinson Crusoe in his tree, with the ladder pulled
                     up—or like the rocked baby of the nursery song. After lying awake half an hour,
                     I regretted having stopped at "Wingdam;" at the end of the third quarter, I
                     wished I had not gone to bed, and when a restless hour passed, I got up and
                     dressed myself. There had been a fire down in the big room. Perhaps it was
                     still burning. I opened the door and groped my way along a passage, vocal with
                     the snores of the Alemanni and the whistling of the night wind; I partly fell
                     down stairs, and at last entering the big room, saw the fire still burning. I
                     drew a chair toward it, poked it with my foot, and was astonished to see, by
                     the up-springing flash, that Parthenia was sitting there also, holding a faded
                     looking baby.</p>
                  <p>I asked her why she was sitting up?</p>
                  <p>She did not go to bed on Wednesday night, before the mail arrived, and then she
                     awoke her husband, and there were passengers to 'tend to."</p>
                  <p>"Did she not get tired, sometimes?"</p>
                  <p>"A little, but Abner," (the Barbarian's Christian name,) "had promised to get
                     her more help next spring, if business was good."</p>
                  <p>"How many boarders had she?"</p>
                  <p>"She believed about forty came to regular meals, and there was transient
                     custom, which was as much as she and her husband could 'tend to. But
                        <emph>he</emph> did a great deal of work." "What work?" "Oh! bringing in the
                     wood, and looking after the traders' things." "How long had she been married?"
                     "About nine years. She had lost a little girl and boy. Three children living.
                        <emph>He</emph> was from Illinois. She from Boston. Had an education,
                     (Boston Female High School—Geometry, Algebra, a little Latin and Greek.) Mother
                     and father died. Came to Illinois alone, to teach school. Saw
                     <emph>him</emph>—yes—a love match, ('Two souls,' etc., etc.) Married and
                     emigrated to Kansas. Thence across the Plains to California. Always on the
                     outskirts of civilization. <emph>He</emph> liked it."</p>
                  <p>"She might sometimes have wished to go home. Would like to, on account of her
                     children. Would like to give them an education. Had taught them a little
                     herself, but couldn't do much on account of other work. Hoped that the boy
                     would be like his father—strong and hearty. Was fearful the girl would be more
                     like her. Had often thought she was not fit for a pioneer's wife."</p>
                  <p>"Why?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh she was not strong enough, and had seen some of his friends' wives in
                     Kansas who could do more<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6642-00000158"/> work. But
                     he never complained—he was so kind"—("Two souls," etc.)</p>
                  <p>Sitting there with her head leaning pensively on one hand, holding the poor,
                     wearied and limp-looking baby wearily on the other arm—dirty, drabbled and
                     forlorn, with the firelight playing upon her features no longer fresh or young,
                     but still refined and delicate, and even in her grotesque slovenliness, still
                     bearing a faint reminiscence of birth and breeding, it was not to be wondered
                     that I did not fall into excessive raptures over the barbarian's kindness.
                     Emboldened by my sympathy, she told me how she had given up, little by little,
                     what she imagined to be the weakness of her early education, until she found
                     that she acquired but little strength in her new experience. How, translated to
                     a backwoods society, she was hated by the women and called proud and "fine,"
                     and how her dear husband lost popularity on that account with his fellows. How,
                     led partly by his roving instincts, and partly from other circumstances, he
                     started with her to California. An account of that tedious journey. How it was
                     a dreary, dreary waste in her memory, only a blank plain marked by a little
                     cairn of stones—a child's grave. How she had noticed that little Willie failed.
                     How she had called Abner's attention to it, but, man like, he knew nothing
                     about children, and pooh-poohed it, and was worried by the stock. How it
                     happened that after they had passed Sweetwater, she was walking beside the
                     wagon one night, and looking at the western sky, and she heard a little voice
                     say "mother." How she looked into the wagon and saw that little Willie was
                     sleeping comfortably and did not wish to wake him. How that in a few moments
                     more she heard the same voice saying "mother." How she came back to the wagon
                     and leaned down over him, and felt his breath upon her face, and again covered
                     him up tenderly, and once more resumed her weary journey beside him, praying to
                     God for his recovery. How with her face turned to the sky she heard the same
                     voice saying "mother," and directly a great bright star shot away from its
                     brethren and expired. And how she knew what had happened, and ran to the wagon
                     again only to pillow a little pinched and cold white face upon her weary bosom.
                     The thin, red hands went up to her eyes here, and for a few moments she sat
                     still. The wind tore round the house and made a frantic rush at the front door,
                     and from his coach of skins in the inner room—Ingomar, the barbarian, snored
                     peacefully.</p>
                  <p>Of course she always found a protector from insult and outrage in the great
                     courage and strength of her husband?</p>
                  <p>Oh yes; when Ingomar was with her she feared nothing. But she was nervous and
                     had been frightened once!</p>
                  <p>How?</p>
                  <p>They had just arrived in California. They kept house then, and had to sell
                     liquor to traders. Ingomar was hospitable, and drank with everybody, for the
                     sake of popularity and business, and Ingomar got to like liquor, and was easily
                     affected by it. And how one night there was a boisterous crowd in the<pb
                        n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6642-00000159"/> bar-room; she went in and tried to
                     get him away, but only succeeded in awakening the coarse gallantry of the half
                     crazed revelers. And how, when she had at last got him in the room with her
                     frightened children, he sank down on the bed in a stupor, which made her think
                     the liquor was drugged. And how she sat beside him all night, and near morning
                     heard a step in the passage, and looking toward the door, saw the latch slowly
                     moving up and down, as if somebody were trying it. And how she shook her
                     husband, and tried to waken him, but without effect. And how at last the door
                     yielded slowly at the top, (it was bolted below,) as if by a gradual pressure
                     without; and how a hand protruded through the opening. And how as quick as
                     lightning she nailed that hand to the wall with her scissors, (her only
                     weapon,) but the point broke, and somebody got away with a fearful oath. How
                     she never told her husband of it, for fear he would kill that somebody; but how
                     on one day a stranger called here, and as she was handing him his coffee, she
                     saw a queer triangular scar on the back of his hand.</p>
                  <p>She was still talking, and the wind was still blowing, and Ingomar was still
                     snoring from his couch of skins, when there was a shout high up the straggling
                     street, and a clattering of hoofs, and rattling of wheels. The mail had
                     arrived. Parthenia ran with the faded baby to awaken Ingomar, and almost
                     simultaneously the gallant expressman stood again before me addressing me by my
                     Christian name, and inviting me to drink out of a mysterious black bottle. The
                     horses were speedily watered, and the business of the gallant expressman
                     concluded, and bidding Parthenia good-bye, I got on the stage, and immediately
                     fell asleep, and dreamt of calling on Parthenia and Ingomar, and being treated
                     with pie to an unlimited extent until I woke up the next morning in Sacramento.
                     I have some doubts as to whether all this was not a dyspeptic dream, but I
                     never witness the drama, and hear that noble sentiment concerning "Two souls,"
                     etc., without thinking of Wingdam and poor Parthenia.</p>
