            <head>PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE career of Nina Gordon, as developed in the following pages, is founded on facts known to many persons now living; but all who could have been wounded by the use of the materials at the Author's command have passed away.</p>
            <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
            <p>If "THE CANCELLED WILL" had claimed its origin in England, it would at once achieve a wide popularity, for it is certainly entitled to rank with the productions of Wilkie Collins, and the <emph>best</emph> of Miss Braddon's. It is quite as well written as the stories of either of these authors, and has an interest for Americans which should be superior to that felt for any foreign book, for it is a picture of American life in one of its marked phases: that of a young and ambitious girl left to follow the devious windings of life, with no guide but a strong will, and the determination to follow out her own ideal of the pursuit of prosperity and happiness.</p>
            <p>The story is vividly and powerfully told. The scene in which the father reveals himself to the child he believes to be dying, is intensely dramatic. The subsequent recovery of Nina, and the use she makes of the revelation to bring retribution upon the unhappy Hastings, is an awful lesson to those who have not yet learned that the "way of the transgressor is hard."</p>
            <p>In striking contrast with this fair Nemesis is the lovely Opal, her half-sister, who is indeed a charming creation.</p>
            <p>There are many characters, all well sustained, and many scenes of dramatic interest. If this book is sensational, it is of the highest order of that school, for it is pure in all its teachings.</p>
            <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
            <p>"THE CANCELLED WILL" is a story of American life, tracing the career of a young girl, who is left in ignorance of her family,<pb n="20-21 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6338-00000003"/> though carefully prepared to fight the battle of life, when the time comes in which she comprehends that on her own efforts must depend the future, she pants to make a brilliant success.</p>
            <p>The story shows what means are used to this end, what experiences she passes through: how strangely her parentage is revealed to her, and the use she makes of that revelation.</p>
            <p>There are many characters, all well sustained, who are thrown into relations toward each other of the most thrilling character; and few readers will be found willing to skip a page of this charming delineation of home life.</p>
            <p>There is sensation enough to keep the attention of the reader enchained; but the pictures of life are true, and pure, and probability is never sacrificed for effect. No mother need hesitate to place any of Miss Dupuy's novels in the hands of her daughters, for there is not a line, or a sentiment to be found in any story of hers that can lower the ideal of true womanhood, or soil the purity of a young girl's mind.</p>
            <p>The career of Nina Gordon may be a warning to many who, like her, rank <emph>success</emph> as the first good in life; but the sequel shows how rarely it is attained through the means used by this fair embodiment of self-will. The saintly Inez, the sweet and womanly Opal Hastings, are charming contrasts to the girl who works such woe to both of them; followed, however, by peace to one, and the sunshine of happiness to the other.</p>
            <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
            <p>Sydney Smith says a novel "is only meant to please; it must do that, or it does nothing." Judged by that test, "THE CANCELLED WILL" deserves a high place, for it absorbs the interest of the reader from the first page to the last. In imaginative power, management of plot, and delineation of the various passions and interests which move its characters, this novel will prove to be a brilliant success.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHO AM I?</head>
               <p>THE fag end of the Newport season had nearly come, and the brilliant summer campaign was almost ended.</p>
               <p>A few who came thither more for the benefit of sea bathing than to figure in the mixed crowds collected from all parts of the Union, still lingered, and among them was an old lady and her companion, a young girl of twenty who, in spite of her dependent position, had managed surreptitiously to enjoy many of the gayeties of the season.</p>
               <p>Nina Gordon attracted much attention from a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">clique</foreign> of fashionable young men, for she was one of those women who always fascinate the opposite sex, though very few of her own would admit that she was more than passably good-looking.</p>
               <p>She was not critically beautiful, but she possessed what the French call "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">le beauté de diable.</foreign>" That is the freshness of youth, and that soft charm of manner which led each admirer in turn to think himself the most favored of her satellites.</p>
               <p>I will sketch her portrait, that the reader may judge of her title to be called <foreign xml:lang="FRA">La Belle</foreign> Nina since her advent at<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6338-00000005"/> Newport. She was of medium height, with a beautifully rounded figure, hands and feet in perfect proportion with her person; the former singularly expressive, for the hands often possess as distinctive a character as the features of the face. Miss Gordon used hers as much as a French-woman, though in other respects her manner was undemonstrative.</p>
               <p>The head that crowned this graceful figure was well set, and at times there was a proud curve in the slender neck which betrayed something of the haughty and defiant spirit that lay beneath the soft womanly graces she knew so well how to assume.</p>
               <p>The features were delicately and clearly moulded, though not perfectly regular, for her nose was slightly retroussé, and her mouth a trifle too wide, but her rosy lips, and the glittering teeth her smile disclosed, made ample amends for the last defect.</p>
               <p>But it was in her singular eyes that the power of her face dwelt. They were long, large and well-set, of the palest shade of gray flecked with amber-colored spots, that seemed to darken or brighten as different shades of light fell on them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes these remarkable eyes were of a soft hazel tint; at others they took the hue of shaded waters, clear and lucent to their very depths. Those expressive orbs could melt, languish, flash with anger, or brighten with merriment, as suited the mood of their capricious owner, and during the few past months more than one had felt their power to fascinate and enthral.</p>
               <p>A mass of light silky hair was wound around her head after a model of her own, which she never varied in compliance with the fashion of the hour. Miss Gordon had studied her own style, and knowing what was most becoming to herself, she wisely adhered to her artistic coiffure. Her complexion was brilliantly fair, with a faint but clear rose tint glowing on her rounded cheeks, and it was not strange after all, that this attractive looking creature, with a power of brain not often bestowed on her sex and years, should have made a sensation in spite of the disadvantages under which she made her début in the gay society assembled at the Ocean House.</p>
               <p>Miss Gordon came to Newport as the paid companion of a fretful and exacting invalid, who monopolized her entire attention from eleven in the morning till ten at night. At that hour, Mrs. Hawks punctually retired, leaving her young attendant, as she supposed, to do the same. But no sooner had the night draught which the old lady regularly took produced its legitimate effect, than the Cinderella of the day transformed herself into the Princess of the night, and <emph>her</emph> fairy godmother was one of the chambermaids, who was liberally paid by the young lady to assist at her toilette, and afford her egress through a linen closet opening from her own apartment, which communicated with one of the main corridors.</p>
               <p>The girl, after dismissing her through this outlet, retired to her own part of the house, but came back punctually at two o'clock, and awaited her return. This was often made at a much later hour, and the fair Nina did not always come to the door alone. Sometimes a gentleman would be with her, and occasionally a young lady, of whom she spoke to Betty as a schoolmate with whom she had long been intimate.</p>
               <p>It was true enough that Kitty Bates had been at the select school in New Haven in which Miss Gordon had received her education, and that sort of intimacy which springs up between an artful and clever girl, and a gay, careless one, gifted with a small modicum of brains, had been cemented between them.</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6338-00000006"/>
               <p>Nina had been good-natured enough to polish off the compositions of Miss Bates, and slily to prompt that giddy young lady in her recitations, for which service Kitty was duly grateful, and they became fast friends.</p>
               <p>Why Nina sought this companionship the other girls were at a loss to divine, for she held herself aloof from intimate association with the rest of her schoolmates, being a year or two in advance of them, both in age and attainments.</p>
               <p>Miss Gordon was the star scholar of the institution; she excelled in her studies, spoke and wrote French and German fluently, was a fine performer on both harp and piano, and drew passable sketches from nature. Yet with all the accomplishments that had been bestowed upon her, she could not tell who she was, or what her position in life was to be.</p>
               <p>When she was but five years of age, a grave, respectable looking man had placed her under the care of Mrs. Lyme, who, at that time, kept a small, insignificant school, which had since expanded into a collegiate institute for young ladies. At so early an age, Nina could remember very little of her past life, and Mr. Somers curtly stated that she was the orphan child of a friend, who had left her jointly to his care, and that of the uncle who defrayed the expenses of her education.</p>
               <p>In after years, Nina often tried to recall the days that had preceded her entrance in the academy, but with very indifferent success. She was intensely anxious to learn something of her own antecedents, but as time passed on, the probability of this seemed to grow fainter and fainter.</p>
               <p>Since the day Mr. Somers placed her with Mrs. Lyme, she had never been visited by her guardian, though she regularly received from him at the close of the year a brief letter, in which he congratulated her in a stiff way on the progress she was making, recommended increased diligence in her studies, and invariably ended by stating that her annual bills were settled, and she was at liberty to draw on Mrs. Lyme for fifty dollars each month, with which to defray the expenses of her wardrobe, and keep her in pocket money.</p>
               <p>This state of things continued till Nina attained her eighteenth year, and she began to look impatiently for some intimation that she was to be removed from the seclusion of the school, and introduced into that world she so ardently desired to enter.</p>
               <p>Finding that nothing of the kind came, Miss Gordon wrote to her guardian and peremptorily demanded some account of herself, and what her future was to be. She had several times before asked the same questions, a reply to which had been diplomatically evaded; but to the imperious one she at last sent him he wrote the following answer:</p>

                              <dateline>"EASTON, May 30, 18—.</dateline>
                           </opener>
                           <p>"MISS GORDON:—Your last letter is before me, and I find it rather dictatorial in its tone. I think you must be a young person who is quite capable of taking care of herself in the future, for your language strikes me as that of an energetic, though rather wilful young woman.</p>
                           <p>"You insist on knowing why a mystery has been kept up with reference to yourself. My dear girl, I am not conscious that such a thing has been attempted. You are an orphan child confided to my care by your uncle, who lives in the South. You are dependent on Mr. Fairlie, and he has educated you in such a manner as to enable you to maintain a respectable position in life through your own exertions.</p>
                           <p>"You are now an accomplished linguist and musician, and Mrs. Lyme has assured me that she will gladly give<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6338-00000007"/> you employment in her school as a teacher in either or both of these branches of education. She offers a handsome salary, which I strenuously advise you to accept, as your uncle will be pleased to hear that you are willing to use the means of independence he has so liberally placed in your power.</p>
                           <p>"With this letter <emph>my</emph> connection with you ceases, as I have thus far only acted as the agent of Mr. Fairlie. I do not think that he intends to give you entirely up himself; but in his last communication with me on this subject, he distinctly stated that it was his intention to leave you to make your own way for the next two years, that he may judge of what kind of metal you are made. Should you stand the ordeal as he hopes and believes you will, he may do something for you in the future. By Mr. Fairlie's express desire I withhold from you the place of his residence.</p>
                           <p>It will be useless for you to write to me again, as I am on the eve of embarking for Europe, where I shall remain several years. The enclosed draft for three hundred dollars is the last of the money placed in my hands for your use.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <salute>Respectfully,</salute>
                              <signed>JOHN SOMERS.</signed>

               </q>
               <p>Nina read this effusion with many conflicting feelings, the predominant one of which was rage. She regarded the draft with dilating eyes and scornful lips, while the bitter and humiliating conviction came to her ambitious heart that all the brilliant accomplishments lavished on her had been given only to fit her to become a school drudge during the brightest and best years of her life.</p>
               <p>How resentfully she recoiled from such a fate words may never tell; for she was self-indulgent and indolent by nature, and she would never have exerted herself to attain the proficiency in her studies she now almost regretted but for the hope that she would thus fit herself for the high position she believed she was designed to fill.</p>
               <p>Yet learning had been no effort to her; her keen intellect and ready memory had made her tasks but pastime; but now that she was required to bend her protean nature to the weary routine of the school-room to win her bread, she regretted that she had not been dull and common-place as the less gifted of her companions.</p>
               <p>It was a bitter blow—how bitter few could understand; for she coveted life's high places with a degree of ardor seldom felt by one so young and so little experienced in the ways of the world. But nature had endowed her with a far-seeing and acute intellect, and she soon made up her mind to accept the position offered her till she could look around and define her future.</p>
               <p>That it should not long be that of a teacher she was quite resolved, for she had a deep-seated aversion to exerting herself in that direction.</p>
               <p>So Nina wiped away the few tears that anger and keen disappointment had wrung from her eyes, and, taking the letter of Mr. Somers with her, sought the private room of Mrs. Lyme.</p>
               <p>That lady—a gray-haired, benevolent-looking woman of fifty—was reclining in a large chair, resting after the toils of the day. When her young visitor drew a low ottoman to her feet, and sunk down on it in an attitude of deep dejection, the kind-hearted preceptress passed her hand caressingly over her hair, and said:</p>
               <p>"You have read your letter, my dear, and you know what you have to depend on in the future. I also have had one from Mr. Somers, and from this time forth he surrenders you entirely to my care. I hope, Nina, that you know I will be true to the trust reposed in me, and do my best to render you happy in your new sphere."</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6338-00000008"/>
               <p>In faltering tones, Nina replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear Madam, I know all that, and I am sure that I am grateful to you for your kindness; but—but this comes on me so suddenly, that—that I am overwhelmed by it. Oh, Mrs. Lyme! was it not cruel—cruel to leave me so long to believe that I was fitting myself for a brilliant position in life, and then to cast me so suddenly upon the world, with only the paltry sum of three hundred dollars as a provision for the future. Oh! it is very, very hard!"</p>
               <p>Tears of anger and mortification were now rolling over her cheeks, and Mrs. Lyme hastened to say:</p>
               <p>"Do not forget, my child, that everything has been done to fit you for the position your guardian has sought for you. I must say for your friends that they have spared no expense, and your bills have been settled as soon as they fell due. Besides, as I understand the arrangement Mr. Somers has made with me, you are only to pass through a probation of two years. At the end of that time, your uncle doubtless intends to remove you to his Southern home, and afford you such advantages as a daughter would enjoy under his roof. In fact, Mr. Somers has intimated as much to me."</p>
               <p>Nina wiped away the tears, and with sudden animation, asked:</p>
               <p>"Who is this uncle? Where does he live, and how am I to communicate with him? I would write to him at once, but Mr. Somers withholds his address at the command of Mr. Fairlie himself, he says. I can't understand why I am to be left in the dark in this way. If I knew where to find him I would write to Mr. Fairlie at once, and show him how useless is the ordeal to which he wishes to expose me. It will only spoil my temper to force on me an occupation so distasteful as teaching. I am not fitted for it; I am too impatient, too impulsive, to attempt to guide others. Dear Madam, if you know the address of my uncle pray give it to me, that I may communicate with him and tell him what I think and feel on this subject."</p>
               <p>"I am unable to give it to you," replied Mrs. Lyme, calmly. "I beg that you will not excite yourself, Nina, for it can do no good. I am quite willing to do all that I can for you, but you must show a willingness to do your part. I only know that a Mr. Fairlie, living somewhere in the South, paid the expenses of your education, but I am not aware either of his first name, nor of the State he resides in. The name is not an uncommon one, and I think it will be quite useless for you to make any efforts to discover what such evident pains have been taken to conceal from you. Accept your position, dear child, and try to do your best in it. I have no doubt as to your ability to perform all the duties I shall require from you. I am ready to transfer to you a music class, for instructing which I will pay you a fair salary."</p>
               <p>Nina started up and paced the floor, wringing her hands, and weeping violently, though her strange eyes flashed with fiery lustre through the whole of the storm. Mrs. Lyme remained passive. She understood in some degree the nature she had to deal with, and she also felt some pity for the creature on whom so heavy a yoke was about to be placed, for the old lady knew it to be no trifle to spend ten hours out of the twenty-four in hearing inexperienced fingers thrum on the piano, producing such sounds as can only torture a sensitive musical ear, such as she knew Nina to possess.</p>
               <p>So far as she herself was concerned, she thought that she was doing a kind action in affording her employment at all, though the girl seemed scarcely to regard it in that light.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Nina sat down again, and abruptly asked:</p>
               <p>"How much do you propose to pay me for my services, Madam?"</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6338-00000009"/>
               <p>"I will give you a home; allow you to retain the room you have so long occupied, and pay you four hundred dollars a year. Is not that a liberal offer, Nina?"</p>
               <p>The lip of the listener curled, and she bitterly said:</p>
               <p>"It is scarcely half as much as Signor Benoni received for the same services from you, Mrs. Lyme. If I am a young girl I am as capable of giving musical instruction as he is; and I cannot see why so great a reduction should be made in the salary offered to me."</p>
               <p>The satisfied smile on the lips of Mrs. Lyme faded away, and she coldly replied:</p>
               <p>"You are free to accept or reject what I offer you, Miss Gordon. There are not many girls of your age who have such an opportunity afforded them to win independence. I feel an interest in you, and when the Signor resigned his position I made up my mind that it should be yours. You forget that you have no experience in teaching, and have yet to prove what you are capable of doing. I admit that you are a brilliant performer, but that is not all that is necessary. If I find that you succeed in your new vocation of course I shall be willing to advance your salary; but you must show your ability to fulfil my requirements before I can think of such a thing."</p>
               <p>With a deep sigh, Nina said:</p>
               <p>"I believe that you are very good, Madam, to try and serve me even in this humble way; for it does seem humble to me after the dreams of grandeur in which I have been so long permitted to revel. I must accept your offer, I suppose, for no other course is open to me at present. I promise to do my best to deserve your kindness, though I am afraid that I shall scarcely make an efficient instructress. I was not intended for that sort of thing, and setting me to make myself useful seems like harnessing a butterfly and bidding it perform such labor as is inconsistent with its very nature."</p>
               <p>"My dear Nina," replied Mrs. Lyme, gravely, "I am sorry to hear you class yourself with the inefficient ones of earth. Every human being has the ability to do <emph>something</emph> in the great struggle of life, and you have had many talents committed to your keeping, for the use of which you must hereafter render an account. As a pupil, you have been the pride of my school, and I am persuaded that in your new position you will prove an efficient assistant."</p>
               <p>Nina was not insensible to this flattery; she raised the hand of her old friend to her lips, and presently said:</p>
               <p>"It is settled then, dear Madam, and next week I suppose I must begin to preside over the eternal tum-tum of the piano. Heavens! what a fate for one who has indulged such dreams as mine have been!" And she again burst into wild sobs and tears.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme scarcely knew how to deal with so versatile a nature as this; so, after a painful pause she said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, Nina, it is settled that you are to remain with me through the two years of probation allotted to you. I have pledged my word to Mr. Somers to that effect, for you are not to be left to follow your own devices. I consider myself as a sort of guardian to you till your mysterious uncle emerges from the obscurity in which he at present chooses to conceal himself. Prove to him that you possess the power as well as the will to sustain yourself under this trial, for I am certain that it will be to your advantage in the future."</p>
               <p>Nina's sobs suddenly ceased, and she eagerly inquired—</p>
               <p>"Why do you say that, Mrs. Lyme? Has Mr. Somers confided to you anything as to my uncle's ultimate intentions with regard to myself? I am afraid that he is a cruel and capricious man, or he would never have educated and supported me as if I were a young princess, to cast me down into this slough of mortification and uncertainty.<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6338-00000010"/> Oh! Mrs. Lyme, if you can throw any light on my actual position, I entreat—I implore that you will do so."</p>
               <p>To this outburst the good lady calmly replied:</p>
               <p>"I know nothing more than has been told you, Nina. I have never held any correspondence with your uncle, and Mr. Somers has carefully concealed from me his place of residence. When he placed you under my charge, he informed me that Mr. Fairlie was a wealthy Southern planter, and no expense would be spared in fitting you for the position you were hereafter to fill. I am impressed with the belief that some change in your uncle's circumstances has dictated his late course toward you, but he evidently hopes that in a couple of years he will be able to reinstate himself and do by you the part he has always intended."</p>
               <p>"But why this mystery? That is what galls me most deeply. <emph>Who</emph> am I? From what place was I brought when I came here? I was too young to remember anything clearly, though I have made every effort to recall my early impressions? What reason can there be for keeping me in the dark as to my own origin and the place I am eventually to occupy in the world? Oh! it is shameful—shameful to treat any creature in so unjustifiable a manner as that."</p>
               <p>There was a pause of some length, and Mrs. Lyme seemed to be debating in her own mind the propriety of the disclosure she was about to make, but she finally said:</p>
               <p>"I learned from Mr. Somers that your uncle is a married man; that his wife is a woman of peculiar temper; that she is very exacting, though devoted to him in her own way. She brought him a large fortune, bestowed on him the position she occupies, and he feels bound to do all that lies in his power to promote her happiness. She would not listen to the introduction of a strange child beneath her roof, and you were brought hither to remain till your education cation was completed. Your mother was Mr. Fairlie's twin sister, and therefore you feel very near to him. He was extremely solicitous that you should have every advantage this institution afforded, and he has always promptly paid every charge. Now, my child, you know all that I can tell you; I expected that you would be removed to Mr. Fairlie's Southern home about this time, and I can account for this abrupt change in but one way. He has become involved, but hopes soon to recover from his embarrassments, and then you will be received beneath his own roof and treated as his daughter."</p>
               <p>"Has my uncle any children?" asked Nina, abruptly, after thinking over this explanation a few moments.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Somers spoke of one, a daughter."</p>
               <p>"How old is she?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know; your guardian was very reserved on the subject of Mr. Fairlie's affairs, and what I have told you I gathered from his replies to the letters I have at intervals written to him concerning yourself. There seems nothing left for you, my dear, but to accept the situation I offer you, and do your best in it. Mr. Fairlie distinctly intimated that on your perseverance in filling the position of music teacher with me depends his future favor.</p>
               <p>"Did he say that to <emph>you,</emph> Mrs. Lyme? I thought you said just now that he had never communicated directly with you."</p>
               <p>"So I did, Miss Gordon, and it is quite correct; but I have a paragraph cut from a letter of Mr. Fairlie's addressed to your guardian. It contained a message to me in which your uncle distinctly says that for two years you must labor for your own support, and if you show that you possess the ability to sustain yourself the future will be bright before you."</p>
               <p>"May I see that fragment, Madam? Oh! pray, let me<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6338-00000011"/> see something that is really tangible from this mysterious kinsman of mine. It will serve to convince me that he is not a myth, as I begin almost to believe."</p>
               <p>"There can be no impropriety in showing you the scrap of writing to which I referred," said Mrs. Lyme; and she lifted the lid of her desk, and took from it the last letter of Mr. Somers to herself. From this she drew a narrow slip of paper on which a few lines were traced in a very peculiar hand. The letters were all turned backward, and as accurately formed as if done by an accomplished master of penmanship. The words were these:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"I wish it were possible to receive Nina beneath my own roof, but at present that is out of the question—you can imagine why. But in my experience I have found that patience accomplishes most things, and I shall slowly pave the way to her reception here.</p>
                  <p>"But she must prove what she is worth herself before I can venture on such a step; let her pass through the discipline of two years of self-dependence, and <emph>then</emph> I will do my part toward securing her future. I have given her the means of independence, and she is not of my blood if she is not willing to use them. For the present I can do no more, for my hands are tied. You must make the child understand what is required of her. I would to God that——"</p>
               </q>
               <p>The fragment ended there, though Nina felt as if she would have given half her life to know what followed the last words.</p>
               <p>She read the lines again and again, but could see nothing more in them than Mrs. Lyme had already told her. She wistfully asked:</p>
               <p>"May I keep this fragment, Madam? It is precious to me as something that actually came from the hand of my uncle."</p>
               <p>After some hesitation, Mrs. Lyme said:</p>
               <p>"It can do no harm to let you keep it, and as it concerns yourself, perhaps it is well for you to retain it by you that it may remind you of what is expected of you."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, thanks, my dear friend; this little scrap of writing may be of the greatest importance to me in the time to come."</p>
               <p>She folded the paper, and placed it carefully in the pocket of her dress. Mrs. Lyme watched her with a vague feeling of uneasiness, uncertain as to the propriety of allowing the fragment to pass from her own possession; but Nina allowed her no opportunity to change her mind. She threw her arms around her, and thanked her with such abandonment of feeling for the great kindness which afforded her a home, and remunerative employment, that the good old lady was completely overwhelmed.</p>
               <p>Nina ended by saying:</p>
               <p>"I will assume my duties on Monday, and I will prove to my uncle that I <emph>can</emph> do something for myself. Two years will soon pass away, and then I shall be free. I shall have some money earned by myself, for I intend to be very economical. I will thoroughly learn the hard lesson set for me, and <emph>then</emph>—Well, it will be time enough to talk about the future when I find out what my uncle really is, and know what he means to do for me."</p>
               <p>The fiery bitterness of her first feelings seemed to have passed away, leaving strength and endurance behind, and Nina left the room apparently reconciled to the sudden change in her destiny.</p>
               <p>As the door closed on her, Mrs. Lyme shook her head gravely and muttered:</p>
               <p>"Poor child! I only hope she will prove equal to what is required of her; but I have painful doubts. Heigh-ho! I shall lose nothing by the transaction at all events, for her<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6338-00000012"/> salary for the two years has already been paid over to me by this singular relative of hers. I wish I understood it all, but I can make nothing of it.</p>
               <p>She drew from the desk the last letter written to her by Mr. Somers, and slowly perused the following lines:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>

                           <p>"It is the wish of Mr. Fairlie that his niece shall remain under your care for two years more; and as it is not probable that she will consent to do so if any means of escape are left open to her, he desires you to give her employment as a teacher of music, or languages, for which services he will pay her <emph>himself,</emph> though, of course, that part of the transaction must be concealed from her.</p>
                           <p>"He earnestly wishes her to acquire the power of imparting her knowledge to others, as the means of forming her character, and fitting her for the position she may hereafter be called on to fill. You will understand his anxiety on this subject, madam, when you remember that she must be a dependent in the house of a woman who, with some good traits, has many eccentricities that may be annoying to those compelled to live beneath the same roof with her.</p>
                           <p>"The state of Mr. Fairlie's domestic affairs just now precludes the reception of this young lady as an inmate of his family, but he will in time be sure to claim her as his sister's child, and place her in a position that will enable her to settle well in life.</p>
                           <p>"From this time forth, I surrender her entirely to your guidance, for I shall be absent from my native land for several years, and in all that I have done for her, I have only sought to serve an early friend to whom I have been under many obligations.</p>

               <p>The letter was a long and closely written one; but only over these closing paragraphs did Mrs. Lyme linger. She read them over several times, and reflected deeply on them. She would have given much to pierce to the heart of the mystery they seemed to shroud, but the attempt was vain, and she wondered when and how it would ever be solved.</p>
               <p>She cherished the kindliest feelings towards the young girl so unpleasantly situated; yet with some complacency reflected that her services would at least be worth her board and lodging. This was well, for she expected little valuable assistance from her new employée. Nina had not been reared with a view toward making herself useful, and Mrs. Lyme had little faith in her power to come up to the standard she had hitherto required from her teachers.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">A FATAL BLOW.</head>
               <p>NINA GORDON was duly installed as teacher of music in the Institute. She had only the youngest pupils confided to her care, and these she disciplined with a high hand; though at intervals she relaxed in her efforts, and seemed ready to give up the task which daily became more distasteful to her.</p>
               <p>The intimacy between herself and Kitty Bates had grown with time, and at the close of Miss Bates' last school term they were close friends. Nina liked the simple-hearted girl well enough, but she chiefly valued her because she was the daughter of a wealthy merchant of New York, who owned a magnificent mansion on one of the fashionable squares, and a summer residence on the Hudson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates had but two children—a son eight years older<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6338-00000013"/> than Kitty, and this "sole daughter of his house and heart." Adolphus was described by his sister as a "perfect love," and the affectionate girl prophecied that when her darling Nina became known to him, he would follow the example of his sister in becoming her most devoted adorer.</p>
               <p>Nina listened complacently; but she privately thought if the irresistible Adolphus resembled his sister, he was a soft-headed ninny of whom it might at a future day be convenient to make a slave. Such a man as Kitty described her brother to be had few attractions for her; he was devoted to fashion, thought only of his own pleasures, and belonged to the school of young America; but, such as he was, Adolphus Bates might be made useful in the game of life she dreamed of playing.</p>
               <p>Nina impatiently awaited the removal of Miss Bates from school, for she felt confident that Kitty would invite her to spend the winter with her in New York; and she had determined in her own mind that she would captivate the young millionaire and probably marry him. This programme would doubtless have been carried out, had not a new actor arrived upon the scene.</p>
               <p>This was a member of the senior class at Yale, who was expected to bear off the highest honors when he graduated, as easily as he had won the suffrages of the young ladies in town by the unrivalled beauty of his person and the graceful ease of his manners.</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton was a Mississippian, reputed to be wealthy, and highly connected, and his command of money, and aristocratic graces seemed to bear witness to the truth of both statements. His college career was brilliant, his popularity both with professors and students great, and few young men ever left Alma Mater with a fairer record behind them.</p>
               <p>Fenton had one great fault; he was too general an admirer of the fairer part of creation, and one of the most dangerous of his class, too, for he had a low, seductive voice, and he excelled in saying those soft nothings which mean so little, yet seemed freighted with sentiment and feeling to their willing dupes. His pretty speeches bound him to nothing, yet he had no intention of deceiving the fair creatures who hung on his words as oracles.</p>
               <p>It was merely Fenton's way to flatter every pretty girl with whom he was thrown in contact, heedless of the results to her; and more than one of his fair friends believed that before he left New Haven for his Southern home, the important question would be asked which would settle her matrimonial destiny and his own.</p>
               <p>Among those who had accepted his graceful homage was Nina Gordon; and this triumphant, careless Adonis, who, like the honey-bee, sipped sweets from every opening flower, did not dream that for him it would have been safer to play with fire than to entangle himself in a flirtation with a creature of flame like the young music teacher.</p>
               <p>The passionate love of such a woman is often a blight and curse to him who is so unfortunate as to win it, as Fenton was yet to find that of Nina Gordon to himself. She believed that he returned the devotion she lavished on him, and for a few months lived in a palace of enchantment, through which airs of Heaven floated, folding her in an atmosphere of such divine sweetness, as melted all the hardness from her nature, and for the time, made her a gentle, true and loving woman.</p>
               <p>Fenton had good musical taste, and the brilliant execution of Nina first drew him to her side. She could not sing with much power, but her voice was sweet and well-trained, and it mingled with his own deep, full tones, in a way that charmed his fastidious ear.</p>
               <p>With her he passed through the same phases of flattery<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6338-00000014"/> and sentiment he had tried with so many others, expecting to escape in the same careless manner, without materially singeing his wings. But as the time for his departure drew near, and no sign came from him of defining his intentions, Nina began to awake to the conviction that to this man she had given the most passionate and devoted love, while she had only moved his fancy, and pleased his taste. She was overwhelmed with rage and humiliation, but all her anger did not uproot one fibre of the passion which had struck its roots into the deepest recesses of her heart.</p>
               <p>Fenton had robbed her of her buoyant trust in life; had blackened its first page with the knowledge of his faithlessness, and she resented the wrong as bitterly as a woman can, but it was long before she ceased to regard him as the most adorable of men.</p>
               <p>Nina was young, and of course foolish, but she suffered deeply enough at this time to have made her a better woman, had hers been one of those natures that suffering improves and purifies; but unfortunately it was not. When the conviction came to her that she was nothing to him, she grew harder and colder; she believed herself victimized at every turn, and for a season, she loathed the very sight of human faces.</p>
               <p>But that phase of misanthropy passed away, and she began to regard life as a battle-field, on which she was to strike her foe without compunction, and practice every <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign> to win the day.</p>
               <p>It was the misfortune of Fenton's life that he was thrown with this fire-spirit at this era of his life. Fate had interwoven the threads of their destinies in a most complicated manner, and it had been far better for him to have met with her in a different scene, and under fairer auspices for both.</p>
               <p>The delusion in which Nina had lived for so many months, lasted to the very eve of his departure for his Southern home. He had graduated, carrying off the first honors; had delivered the most eloquent valedictory that had ever been heard within the college walls, and received the congratulations of his host of friends and admirers.</p>
               <p>On the last evening of his stay he came to bid Nina farewell, and she fully believed that before the parting words were said, he would ask her to become the companion of his future life—would vow to fly on the wings of love to prepare his home for her reception.</p>
               <p>It was a lovely summer night, and they strolled together through the elm-shaded walks surrounding the academy, with no witness to this parting interview save the silent stars that looked down upon them from the blue concave above.</p>
               <p>How her heart thrilled, and her ear thirsted for the words she hoped to hear; but they came not. Even his usual flatteries were not uttered that night, for he had become aware that they were edged tools it was no longer safe to play with. Suddenly it occurred to him that by giving her his confidence, he might place himself in a truer position toward her, and show her how groudless her hopes were without risking an explosion on her part. He gently said:</p>
               <p>"You have been very kind to me, Miss Gordon, and I will prove to you how highly I appreciate your goodness by telling you something of myself—of my future prospects. Will you listen to my egotism with patience?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I will. I shall be glad to hear whatever you may be willing to confide to me."</p>
               <p>She looked up in his face. The moon had risen, and its white light glanced athwart her glowing features; with an inward shiver he read the perfect trust—the tender joy that revealed how different was the communication she anticipated from that he had actually to make.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6338-00000015"/>
               <p>For a moment Fenton faltered, but his natural audacity came to his aid, and he said:</p>
               <p>"I have been highly favored by the good graces of many of my young lady friends, and I feel duly grateful. But I wonder how much was due to my own claims, or to the wealth with which it was presumed I am endowed? If the truth were known that I have very little of my own, that I am dependent on my mother, who draws her income from property bequeathed to her by a second husband, I hardly think that I should have been so feted and caressed. Do you think, in that case, the dear creatures would have listened so complacently to my flatteries as many of them have done? Eh, Miss Nina?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot answer for others," she steadily replied. "I can only speak for myself, and I do not hesitate to say that your worldly position is of little moment to me—yourself, everything. You have given me the right to say this, Mr. Fenton, and I wish to be perfectly frank with you."</p>
               <p>"The devil!" thought the young man. "What are we coming to next, I wonder? A regular declaration, I suppose, if I hang back. Phew! what a girl it is! and what shall I do to get out of such an infernal scrape as this threatens to be?"</p>
               <p>She saw his hesitation and confusion, and a sudden shiver ran through her blood—the first bitter premonition of the truth. She grasped his arm with a convulsive clutch, and spoke in tones she vainly tried to steady.</p>
               <p>"Tell me about yourself, Godfrey. Give me the confidence you volunteered just now. I must understand your true position."</p>
               <p>"It is not a very agreeable one, Nina; for as I told you, I am almost entirely dependent on my mother. She is a woman of strong will and relentless purpose. I am attached to her, of course, but she rules me with a rod of iron. She supplies me liberally with funds, but I dare not disobey her wishes or I should speedily come to grief."</p>
               <p>"I—I begin to understand. You cannot entangle yourself in a marriage engagement without your mother's consent. I see now why you have not before spoken to the point. Oh! Godfrey, must we yield our happiness to the caprices of another? A happiness that has been so pure, so perfect."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens, Nina, what can you mean by such language as that!" exclaimed the young man in a tone of such astonishment—almost of horror—that every vibration of his voice struck as a sharp-edged dagger to the heart of the girl who clung to him as if he were her only hope in life. Nina suddenly withdrew herself from his side, looked into his face with a searching, fiery glance, and imperiously demanded:</p>
               <p>"Godfrey Fenton, what are we to be to each other in the future? Answer me truly as you hope for peace on earth or happiness in heaven! In this hour have the manhood to play a straightforward part, if you never have done so before."</p>
               <p>He quailed before the passion of her voice, and deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"Nina, what can you mean? I—I do not understand you. We have been the best of friends to each other—nothing more."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nothing more!</emph> ha! ha!" and her wild laugh fairly curdled his blood, as it echoed shrilly on the silent air.</p>
               <p>"Man—demon, rather!—have you not wooed me for months as if I were the one desire of your heart? Have you not made me believe that you existed alone for me; and now, when you <emph>know</emph> that you have won a return to the love you proffered, you dared to say to me that we are but the best of friends. But you shall not trifle with me<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6338-00000016"/> with impunity, if you do so with others. If they suffer in silence, I will not. I will <emph>compel</emph> you to act the part of a man and a gentleman."</p>
               <p>She spoke so rapidly and defiantly that for a moment he was unable to find words in which to reply; but his temper was by this time aroused, and he insolently asked:</p>
               <p>"In what way will you accomplish that? Will you sue me for breach of a marriage promise that was never made? for I defy you to prove that I have ever gone further with you than to utter the unmeaning gallantries which are hourly bandied between young men and women. I have sincerely admired you, Miss Gordon, but I would never have asked you to become my wife, for my hand is already plighted to another."</p>
               <p>The anger and contempt aroused by his first words were merged in dismay and despair by the announcement last made. She faintly gasped:</p>
               <p>"Betrothed! Then you are a doubly-dyed traitor! How dared you, an engaged man, approach me as you have done? for you have wooed me in every way but asking the final question as to whether I would consent to become your wife. You do not love this girl to whom you assert yourself to be bound. Who is she? What is she?"</p>
               <p>Fenton shrugged his shoulders, and coolly replied:</p>
               <p>"Really, Miss Gordon, this scene passes my comprehension. I am willing to gratify your curiosity, though it is not expressed in the most courteous manner. My betrothed bride is a lady living in my native state. She is yet very young, but our union is to take place in three years from this time. She is lovely both in person and mind, and from childhood we have both known that our parents designed us for each other. If I had suspected that my unfortunate habit of saying tender things to every pretty woman I meet would produce such a result as this, I should have proclaimed the fact of my engagement so loudly that none could fail to hear of it. It is most unfortunate that you should so have mistaken my attentions to you, for I am not free to do what you would consider the right thing. I am as poor as a church mouse, and Opal Hastings is the heiress to immense wealth. If I were mad enough to refuse to marry her, my mother would cut me off with a shilling. That is the whole case in a nut-shell. But I must not forget that I have a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tendresse</foreign> for the fair Opal herself. She must develop into a charming woman."</p>
               <p>The passion of rage and contempt that surged in the heart of the listener rendered her speechless for a few moments. She bitterly felt that this insolent trifler had robbed her of her most priceless treasure,—her great love, her perfect trust in his honor and truth, and at the moment she hated and scorned him as he stood there before her, arrayed in all his god-like beauty. His stately figure, formed both for grace and vigor; his clear complexion, and finely-cut features, his expressive hazel eyes, and clustering curls of blonde hair shading a high and haughty brow, were all unrivalled, and Nina asked herself if God had made so fair a piece of handiwork, yet forgotten to place a heart within his bosom.</p>
               <p>She knew him now, and she despised him; but the passion with which he had inspired her did not die out with the conviction that it had never been returned. That would live through bitter struggles before it was strangled and coffined, and she felt that the sods that would be stamped down upon its grave would bury deep beneath themselves hope, joy, happpiness; perhaps more than that—she did not know—she could not tell, for all was chaos within her brain now; and if the solid earth beneath her feet had receded, and the heavens rolled themselves together in a scroll of fire, she could scarcely have been more bewildered<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6338-00000017"/> dered and trembling than she felt herself in this moment of supreme suffering.</p>
               <p>She presently repeated in a vague tone:</p>
               <p>"Opal! it is a strange name—an ominous one, to my fancy. How did Miss Hastings come by it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, that is only a pet name. She was christened Laura, but in her babyhood she took so great a fancy to an opal ring her mother wore, that the stone was taken out and set in the clasp of her coral necklace. Her father playfully called her his little opal, and the name gradually clung to her. I like it, for it suits her style amazingly."</p>
               <p>"What is her style?" asked Nina, in the same dull tone.</p>
               <p>"Somewhat similar to your own; and, if you will pardon me for telling you, I will say that the resemblance between yourself and my betrothed first induced me to seek your, acquaintance. Opal is different from you, too, in some respects. She has large, soft, blue eyes, of the true violet hue, with that faint purple tint that is so rare and so enchanting; and her hair is not pale amber like yours, but a rich, chestnut brown—the genuine <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tan d'or.</foreign> Her complexion is as pure as the milky surface of the gem whose name she bears, and the flitting color in her cheeks flames up and dies as suddenly away as the fire imprisoned in the heart of the opal flashes or fades out as the light shifts over its surface. Her face is one to study a life-time, and never understand. Young as my betrothed is, she is as inexplicable to me as a sphinx or—a <emph>woman!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Nina listened eagerly. Was a clue to her uncle's family at last afforded? This resemblance might lead to something; and, passing over the half scornful emphasis with with which Fenton uttered the last word, she rapidly asked:</p>
               <p>"Had—had the father of this young girl a sister who died in her youth leaving a daughter? Can you tell me that? If you can I will almost forgive what has passed between us this evening."</p>
               <p>"Really I do not know. Mr. Hastings came to Mississippi from one of the Northern States. He was a struggling young lawyer, when he met with a wealthy widow and married her. Opal is their only child; but of the family or antecedents of her father I know nothing."</p>
               <p>"And I really resemble Miss Hastings? I would give a great deal to see her, not because she is my rival, Mr. Fenton, as your vanity may lead you to imagine, but because I have a vital interest in discovering if this young lady is related to me."</p>
               <p>"God forbid!" was the ejaculation that rose to Fenton's lips, so quickly that it was with some effort repressed; but he managed to reply without undue eagerness:</p>
               <p>"A connection between you is scarcely possible. There is that vague resemblance which is often found between utter strangers, but nothing to indicate the tie of blood. I am at a loss to understand why you should wish to claim Miss Hastings as a relative."</p>
               <p>"If you care to listen to my story, I am willing to relate it. I intended to explain my position to you to-night, and although our relations are so materially changed, I may as well keep to my purpose."</p>
               <p>Fenton bowed courteously, and Nina gave him a rapid outline of the little that was known to her of her antecedents. He listened with more interest than he had believed possible, for a sudden dread had seized him that Nina's suspicions might be true, and if so, what a dilemma he might yet find himself placed in. This girl, much as she had lately attracted him, had suddenly become almost an object of terror to him; and he shivered at the thought of what mischief she might hereafter plot against him should they<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6338-00000018"/> be thrown together by the chances of fate. What evil influence might she not gain over those in whose hands lay his future destiny? A warning glimpse of the future seemed to open before him, and strong man as he was, he almost trembled before the possibilities his imagination evoked.</p>
               <p>When Nina ceased speaking, he controlled himself sufficiently to say with perfect coolness:</p>
               <p>"I am quite certain that Mr. Hastings was not the uncle who placed you in your present asylum. Besides, the name is different."</p>
               <p>"What does that signify? Of course he would not suffer his real name to be used in a transaction as mysterious as my removal hither."</p>
               <p>"That may be true, but I am sure that I have heard Mr. Hastings say that he was an only child, so it is impossible that your mother should have been his sister. Besides, if you are his niece, there is no reason why he should not receive you beneath his own roof. I am sure that his wife would not object, for she is liberal as she is wealthy."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hastings cannot then be the person Mr. Somers spoke of as my uncle's wife, for I clearly understood from him that my aunt's singular temper was the cause of my being educated so far away from my connections. I feel that I have been unfairly treated, though money has not been spared on my education; and this stupid fancy to turn me into a teacher for the sake of the discipline it would give me, is a mistake. The drudgery I have borne has tarnished the brightness of my youth, embittered my proud spirit, and made me rebellious against him who forced it on me. The crowning anguish has come to me to-night, and I begin to think that I shall do well to take my destiny in my own hands for the future, and make what I can of it. If it is marred, it will be the fault of those who drove me into the vortex—not mine."</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton noted the suppressed passion in the cynical tone she attempted to assume, and for several moments he was at a loss what reply to make. His light nature was hardly touched with compunction for the evil he had wrought her, and his vanity was flattered by the passion she had avowed for him. He had little faith in the constancy of women, and he believed that Nina Gordon would prove no exception to the rest of the sex. Now that she knew him to be poor, and dependent on his mother, she would withdraw her affections, and bestow them upon some one more capable of appreciating them than he had shown himself. Vain as he was, he knew that much of his social success was due to his presumed position as a man of fortune, and he did not believe that his hand and heart would alone suffice to content even the impassioned girl beside him.</p>
               <p>Assuming his softest tone, he presently said:</p>
               <p>"If my destiny had not been settled for me long ago, Nina, I would lift you from your equivocal position, place you by my side, and let this mysterious uncle of yours forever remain in the darkness in which he has seen fit to envelop himself. I admire you greatly; I could love you devotedly, if my allegiance were not already claimed by another. But I am bound to Opal by ties I cannot break, and——"</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir!" cried the girl, with an imperious stamp of her foot. "How dare you speak thus to me after what has so lately passed between us? Know, Mr. Fenton, that if you were free to-morrow, if you could endow me with unbounded wealth, I would refuse the hand which a few hours since I foolishly and fondly thought could bestow such perfect happiness upon me as no child of earth has a right to expect. You have trifled with me—deceived me as no other will ever have power to do; but you shall not further insult me by uttering professions as hollow as your own<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6338-00000019"/> nature is false. Adieu, sir; go back to your southern home; claim the bride who there awaits you; but remember through all your prosperity that, if I can find the means of striking you, of wounding you to the heart in my turn, I shall surely avail myself of them."</p>
               <p>Before Fenton could recover himself sufficiently to reply she was gone, and he stared after her receding figure with a feeling of mingled anger and surprise. Recovering himself, he shrugged his shoulders in a nonchalant way and muttered:</p>
               <p>"What a tiger cat it is! I wonder, now, what she thinks she can do against me, even if fate should be malicious enough to throw her in my path again. I am glad to be rid of her now at all events, and I shall most devoutly pray that we may never chance to meet in the future."</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton slowly strolled down the shaded avenue in which he had been so abruptly left standing alone, made his exit through a side gate, and sought his own quarters.</p>
               <p>He slept as well that night as though this strange interview had never taken place; but the deserted girl on whose heart he had so carelessly trampled spent its long hours in alternate bursts of passionate weeping, and defiant struggles to put aside the weight of anguish that was crushing her to the earth.</p>
               <p>After that night came the change of which I have spoken, and the harder elements of Nina Gordon's nature gained the ascendancy from that night of humiliation and despair.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Fenton left New Haven, and for many weary months afterward Nina heard nothing from him. She never mentioned his name, and he seemed to have dropped as completely out of her life as if he had been no more to her than the merest stranger.</p>
               <p>But this apparent forgetfulness was only on the surface; in the silence of her own heart she brooded over the past, recalled every scene in which they had mutually borne a part, and meditated almost to madness on the means of finding him again—of striking at him in her turn a blow that should wound him more deeply than he had stricken her.</p>
               <p>Should that opportunity ever arrive, and some secret instinct told her that it surely would, then the gay trifler might indeed grow pale and tremble before the retribution that should be dealt by the hand he had rejected—planned and carried out by the heart he had won only to throw back.</p>

               <head type="sub">ON THE WING.</head>
               <p>THE autumn with its golden splendor and regal days, faded into dimness, and winter crowned with its pearly mantle and glittering ice-gems passed away, and again the vernal season smiled over the earth.</p>
               <p>Nina Gordon had looked forward to the month of April with a depth of solicitude which can be understood when it is stated that her probation of two years ended with its last day, and she began to look for some communication from her uncle with a feverish restlessness that was intensely painful.</p>
               <p>Day after day passed by; May blossomed into June, and still no intimation that her existence was even remembered, came from her unknown relative.</p>
               <p>She gradually came to the conclusion that at twenty she was considered capable of taking care of herself, and after two years of self-dependence, she would be willing to do so, therefore her fate was left at her own disposal.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6338-00000020"/>
               <p>When another month had passed away, and no letter came from Mr. Fairlie, she felt free to act as she pleased, and her irrevocable determination was to relinquish the situation of music teacher in the institute. The labor required of her was too great, and the employment became daily more odious to her. It seemed to her that she had given two of the best years of her life to this uncongenial drudgery, and she had thus earned the right to enjoy herself in some way more suited to her tastes than the horrible humdrum monotony of the school in which nearly all her days had been spent.</p>
               <p>Nina did not shrink from the thought of venturing forth into the untried world that lay beyond the walls of her present home. On the contrary, like the imprisoned eagle that beats his wings against the bars that confine him, she chafed hourly against the restraints her position as teacher laid upon her.</p>
               <p>She had been very economical, and her two years' salary, with two hundred dollars she had saved from the last remittance sent her by her guardian, was deposited in bank to her credit.</p>
               <p>What she could accomplish with that hard earned money was her constant thought. It must launch her in life, afford her the power to win the brilliant destiny she was resolved to achieve, and she pondered on the first step it would be necessary to take to give her a chance of success.</p>
               <p>She had hoped ere this to receive an invitation from Kitty Bates to visit her, for that young lady had graduated in the previous year, and returned to her father's magnificent home in New York.</p>
               <p>Kitty kept up a very active correspondence with her friend, but made no demonstrations toward securing her as a companion, and Nina was shrewd enough to understand that her changed position had become known to the parents, and the poor music teacher was no longer considered a desirable friend for their daughter.</p>
               <p>She might possibly aspire to the honor of becoming the wife of their only son, and of course such a mis-alliance was carefully to be guarded against. Their precious Adolphus must marry in his own set, and it would not be wise to expose him to the dangerous fascinations which Kitty so eloquently described.</p>
               <p>So the poor girl had been snubbed, and her friend proscribed.</p>
               <p>As Nina imagined, so it had actually happened, for neither Mr. nor Mrs. Bates would listen to the introduction of Miss Gordon beneath their roof with a prospect of her remaining any length of time to lay her snares for the young heir apparent.</p>
               <p>After reading one of Kitty's affectionate epistles, Nina sat pondering over it, half resentful that the hoped for invitation had not yet been received, but not materially discouraged she tossed her proud head, and defiantly muttered:</p>
               <p>"I will make Kitty serve my turn yet, and as to the absurd brother, I mean to wind him around my fingers as if he were a skein of the softest silk. These people have money, but they have little refinement, and less culture; yet, why should I care if they do not exactly come up to my own standard? My dream of love is ended, and the sentimental noodle Kitty described, will answer as well to endow me with place and fortune as any other of his tribe. Faugh! how I scorn the whole faithless sex after my one venture on the sea of love. I wonder where that traitor is now, and what he is dreaming of? Not me, I am very sure." And her thoughts wandered back to that evening beneath the elms, in which her air castles had fallen into ruins before her, and the clay feet of the idol she had shrined within them had shown themselves.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6338-00000021"/>
               <p>The bitterest phase of the struggle was over now. She believed that she had let the "dead past bury its dead," but she felt that she was disenchanted. Life had lost its glamour, and the most she hoped for now was to shine among the brilliant favorites of fortune, and in constant excitement find some compensation for the happiness she had lost.</p>
               <p>Just as Nina was hesitating as to the first move she would make in the brilliant role she aspired to play, another letter came from Kitty Bates, from which we make the following extract:</p>

                              <dateline>"NEW YORK, July 8, 18—.</dateline>
                           </opener>
                           <p>"DEAREST NINA:—It is settled that we are to go to Newport in a few weeks, to remain there the rest of the season. Mamma has not been well enough to leave home this summer, but now the physician orders sea-bathing for her, and we are to go as soon as we can get ready. I am having a beautiful wardrobe prepared, for I mean to be at least one of the best dressed girls there, if I cannot be one of the handsomest.</p>
                           <p>"I am enchanted with the prospect of spending the month of August at so fashionable a resort, and if I could only manage to have you with me there, my dearest girl, I should be the happiest of creatures.</p>
                           <p>"I have even been contriving how it can be accomplished, and I have a plan, but I must tell you first of something else that will make you laugh. I wanted Pa to let me ask you here, and take you along with us, but he shook his wise old head, and said:</p>
                           <p>"'That young friend of yours may prove too attractive to Dolly, and you know she has no fortune. Not that it is really of much consequence about that, but you see the boy is a great catch, and unless he gets a wife with money of her own, how is he to know that he is not accepted for his?'</p>
                           <p>"To this I replied:</p>
                           <p>"'Oh, nonsense, Pa; Nina is a fortune in herself, and she wouldn't think of Dolly unless she liked him for himself. If he were to fancy her, and she him, it would be the nicest thing for us all, for she has more fun in her than any one alive. If you could only see her take people off, you'd laugh till you were sick.'</p>
                           <p>"He opened his eyes very wide, and repeated:</p>
                           <p>"'Take people off! That is a singular way of making herself amusing. What can you mean, Kitty, by such nonsense?'</p>
                           <p>"'Oh, you dear old goose,' I dutifully said, 'don't you understand that Nina is an unrivalled mimic?'</p>
                           <p>"He shook his head; declared it to be a most dangerous and unpopular power, and refused to listen to any further entreaties from me in your behalf.</p>
                           <p>"I don't know why I tell you this, my dear, unless it is to excuse myself for not asking you to stay with me before this. After our long intimacy, it is a shame that I am not allowed to rescue you from the wretched life you lead with those everlasting music lessons, of which I know you are heartily tired. But I can't help myself, and I have half a mind to marry the first eligible that pops the question, that I may have a home of my own to receive you in.</p>
                           <p>"<emph>Then</emph> indeed we would have fine times together. But Pa will be by me as he is by Dolly—money must wed money, or he will not listen to a proposal for my hand, and the only beau I have that pleases me at all is not rich.</p>
                           <p>"With that hope shut out for the present, at least, I have thought of a way by which we can be brought together again, provided you will consent to make such a sacrifice of yourself.</p>
                           <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6338-00000022"/>
                           <p>"Your last letter informed me that you had heard nothing from your uncle; that you are wearied and dispirited with the monotonous round of your life, and I am sure I do not know how you have stood it so long; but you cannot leave Mrs. Lyme without something certain before you.</p>
                           <p>"The engagement I have in view for you I should never have presumed to suggest if it did not offer a chance of throwing us together at Newport. Once near us, my parents will have an opportunity of finding out how charming you are, and I may carry my point and have you with me next winter.</p>
                           <p>"But I must explain. There is a lady living in the same street with us who is a confirmed invalid, and I am afraid a very cross one; but you can stand that after your experience with a parcel of stupid children.</p>
                           <p>"Mrs. Hawks wants a companion, and she is also going to Newport in the hope that sea-bathing may benefit her health. You will be in attendance on her during the greater part of the day; but at night you will be free; and, with a little management, you will be able to enjoy some of the gayeties of the season without the knowledge of your Cerebus. Mamma shall chaperon you—on that I am resolved; so have no doubts as to our ability to carry out that part of the programme.</p>
                           <p>"Mrs. Hawks offers a liberal salary, for she is rich, and has no chick or child of her own to give her money to. Now, dear, what should prevent you from getting into her good graces, and taking a good slice out of her fortune at her death, even if she should not take such a fancy to you as to leave you the whole. You would not have long to wait either, for the old lady can't last much longer, the doctors say.</p>
                           <p>"Nina, darling, this is only a stepping stone, and I venture to hope that you will consent to place your dainty feet upon it. Who knows to what it may lead? As beautiful and clever as you are, you must soon have beaux enough at your feet to afford you as good a choice as all my pa's money bags will ever get for me.</p>
                           <p>"Think over all the chances even this humble start in life may procure you, and make up your mind to accept it, for the sake of being once more near your devoted Kitty, who is like a fish out of water without her dearest chum."</p>

               </q>
               <p>There was much more in the same strain, and, after reading over her friend's long letter several times, Nina thought deeply on its contents. Her resolution was soon taken, for she was far too practical to despise the "day of small things," and she thankfully availed herself of the opening thus made for her.</p>
               <p>She seized her pen, and wrote at once to Kitty to accept the offer and arrange the preliminaries of her removal; she declared that she was quite willing to render herself useful in any way to Mrs. Hawks, provided she could be in New York at the time her dear Kitty would be there.</p>
               <p>Nina dispatched this letter without consulting Mrs. Lyme on the change she contemplated making. When she knew positively what she had to depend on, she thought it would be time enough to warn her of her intended departure.</p>
               <p>After a brief correspondence, it was finally arranged that Miss Gordon should spend a few days in the Bates mansion before joining her new employer, as it would not be convenient for Mrs. Hawks to receive her till the eve of her departure for Newport. How Kitty had obtained this concession Nina neither knew nor cared; it was sufficient for her that the invitation was given, and she thought it would be her own fault if nothing came of it.</p>
               <p>Having settled this, Nina sought Mrs. Lyme and communicated<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6338-00000023"/> municated to her the change she contemplated making. That lady listened with displeased surprise, and coldly said:</p>
               <p>"I hardly thought you would be in so great a hurry to run away from your oldest friend, Nina; and I did hope that I should have been consulted before you entered into any positive engagement with another person."</p>
               <p>"To what purpose should I have done that, Mrs. Lyme? My determination to leave the dreary life I have led for the two past years is irrevocable, and I wisely placed it out of your power to influence me, by completing my arrangements before speaking with you about them."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme drily asked:</p>
               <p>"What do you expect to gain by the exchange you seem so anxious to make? If you think that constant attendance on an irritable invalid is less wearisome than giving musical instruction, you will soon discover your mistake. Our life here has an agreeable variety in it, though I admit there is very little excitement. I have done all that I could to render your stay with me pleasant, and I am sorry to find that you are so eager to escape from me."</p>
               <p>"It is not, I assure you, that I wish to go away from you, Mrs. Lyme, for I owe you many thanks for what you have done for me. But teaching is not my forte. I do not know that nursing will be, but I can at least try it. I must do something for a support, since it seems that I am to be left to fight my own battle with life."</p>
               <p>"My child, you have too hastily come to that conclusion; I feel certain that your uncle will yet seek you out, and remove you to his own home. He evidently believes you to be safe and happy here; therefore he waits till the summer is over before claiming you. At this season you could not go south, you know, without danger of being ill."</p>
               <p>Nina abruptly replied:</p>
               <p>"I have given up all hope of ever knowing anything of my family. I believe that all has been done for me that was originally intended, and I accept the plain hint given me that I must look out for myself in the future. If my uncle meant to acknowledge and provide for me, he would never have held himself aloof from me in the way that he has done, nor taken such pains to conceal from me the place of his residence."</p>
               <p>"You may be right, Nina, for his conduct seems very strange to me; but it is your duty to wait at least till autumn before you take any decisive step. <emph>Then,</emph> if you hear nothing from Mr. Fairlie, I shall no longer object to the change you wish to make. Consent to remain with me, dear child, at least a few months longer. You are too young, and far too attractive, to be sent out in the world alone. I will increase your salary, and with the habits of economy you have acquired in the last two years, you can render yourself quite independent."</p>
               <p>A scornful and bitter smile curled the lips of the listener, and she asked:</p>
               <p>"Would you have me give all the years of my youth to the pitiful drudgery I have endured as patiently as possible, in the hope that I might thus win the approbation of that rich uncle of mine? No, Mrs. Lyme, I will bear it no longer. I will seek a more congenial field for the exercise of such talents as I possess, and perhaps those who have so cruelly cast me off may yet have cause to be proud of the friendless outcast they denied a home beneath their roof. I possess energy and will, and when combined as they are in me, I am sure they constitute a power that shall yet enable me to achieve a brilliant future."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme listened skeptically and sadly. She gravely replied:</p>
               <p>"I have long known that you are ambitious, Nina, but you know very little of the stern realities of life. Many<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6338-00000024"/> have started in it with as brilliant anticipations as you seem to indulge, only to meet disappointment and defeat. You are safe with me, and I shrink from the dangers you are so recklessly rushing to encounter."</p>
               <p>"What danger for me can you anticipate, dear madam? I am going into the enployment of a highly respectable and wealthy lady, who is well known to the Bates family. Through Mrs. Bates' recommendation the situation was procured for me, and I have positively accepted it. It may humiliate my pride a little to be at the beck and call of my new patroness, but I am sure I shall be able to bear that in consideration of the advantages I shall gain with her."</p>
               <p>"What are those advantages, Nina? You may be compelled to submit to the fractious caprices of an irritable woman, who will doubtless exact from you far more than I have required. She may discharge you at any moment, and then what is to become of you? The money you have saved will not keep you above want very long, and when it is exhausted, what will you have to fall back on? Oh! child, child! you do not dream what it is to a woman tenderly and carefully nurtured to be thrown upon a wide and cheerless world without a protector, without means that are ample for any emergency. Reflect on what may happen to you, and remain in a safe asylum, though it is not entirely congenial to you."</p>
               <p>To this appeal Nina steadily replied:</p>
               <p>"I must brave all those possibilities, Mrs. Lyme, for my word is pledged to Mrs. Hawks that I will accompany her to Newport, where she is at present going. She relies on me and I cannot disappoint her."</p>
               <p>"To Newport! Ah! I see what the temptation was that lured you from me. But, Nina, do you comprehend all the mortifications that await one of your proud temper in such a place as that? You will be passed by as a mere nobody —looked on as a dependent, almost a menial. Can you, who have been reared to believe yourself destined to a high position in life, bear all the slights you will be sure to meet in the brilliant sphere you are so anxious to enter, though it be only in the character of a looker on."</p>
               <p>A faint smile curled Nina's lip, and her strange eyes gleamed with a light Mrs. Lyme could not understand, as she replied:</p>
               <p>"I have maturely weighed all those considerations, and I have made up my mind to bear what is inevitable. I shall doubtless meet with some things I shall find hard to bear, but I shall find my reward in enduring them with patience. Kitty Bates is going to Newport with her mother, and with them I shall enjoy such freedom as I may obtain after my daily duties are over. It is understood that after ten o'clock in the evening my attendance on Mrs. Hawks is over till the following day. She has a competent maid who takes care of her at night, and my chief employment will be to amuse and keep her in good humor when she is awake. I do not doubt my power to do that, and I shall prefer it to giving music lessons. In the evening I shall be free, and with Mrs. Bates as my chaperon, I can enter into some of the gayeties of the season. I shall be quite safe, I assure you, and how I thirst for this change, how much I need it, you cannot understand, for you know little of the mental struggles I have gone through during these last months of my life."</p>
               <p>"I know far more than you dream of, Nina," was the sad reply. "I have watched you with a solicitude that was often painful, though I have forborne to speak of what I knew was troubling you. That the uncertainty concerning your uncle's intentions was not your heaviest burden I well know, but you have proved yourself brave and strong, and if you would only have a little patience all might be well<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6338-00000025"/> with you. I can only say that, if you meet with disappointment—if you should need a friend or a home, return to me. My house shall always be open to you; my heart will never refuse a welcome to the child I have as solicitously watched over as if she were of my own blood."</p>
               <p>Nina was touched by the kindness which she felt that her course had scarcely deserved, and with some genuine emotion she said:</p>
               <p>"I cannot sufficiently thank you for your goodness, dear madam, and I hope at some future day I shall be able to make a return for it in something more substantial than words."</p>
               <p>"Since you must go, you will of course write regularly to me and keep me informed of all that happens to you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I shall write—certainly I shall write to you and tell you how I am getting on. But you must not expect me to go into a minute account of myself, for that I cannot promise. But there is one thing I am not likely to forget, Mrs. Lyme, and that is that you are the best friend I have in the world. I know that on you I can implicitly rely if I get into any difficulties in my new career, and I shall always turn to you for advice."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my dear, for believing that. You shall have both advice and assistance from me if you find that you need them."</p>
               <p>Not much more was said, and Mrs. Lyme retired to her private sanctum with a sad heart. She was a good woman, but rather strict in her ideas of propriety, and this escapade on the part of her young music-teacher filled her with dread and dismay. She felt a tender interest in her fair protégée, and thought herself responsible in some degree for her future well-being. She had her own thoughts concerning the mystery in which Nina's relatives chose to envelop themselves, but she was a prudent woman and kept her vague surmises locked in her bosom. She often wondered why the mind of the girl should have been filled with such delusive notions as to her prospects in life by the money so lavishly spent on her, only to leave her stranded at the very commencement of her career.</p>
               <p>That the mystery was not a creditable one she greatly feared, but she was willing to keep Nina near her, and afford her such guidance and protection as she felt assured so ill-balanced a creature would need in her earthly pilgrimage. But she could do nothing now. She had no authority to detain Nina against her own will, and she saw her prepare to depart from the home that had so long sheltered her, with many sad forebodings as to what her fate would be in that world she so eagerly panted to enter.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">ADRIFT.</head>
               <p>MRS. LYME found an escort for Nina to New York in the person of an old friend of her own, who was going there on business. Mr. Norris promised to see her safe to the residence of Mr. Bates on Fifth Avenue.</p>
               <p>Nina wept a few tears when she parted from her old friend, but they were soon wiped away, and her spirits rose to their highest point as she was swept onward to the great emporium in which she believed she would find the solution of her destiny.</p>
               <p>Late on the evening of a bright day in July, she was set down before the aristocratic looking mansion in which her former schoolmate lived, and Kitty herself came flying down the marble steps to greet her.</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6338-00000026"/>
               <p>The two girls met with most diffusive evidences of affection, and after thanking Mr. Norris, and taking leave of him, Nina followed her friend into the house.</p>
               <p>Kitty hurriedly said:</p>
               <p>"Come up to my room at once, Nina, for I thought you would prefer being with me as we used to be at school. I have a boudoir and bed-room opening from each other, and we can be as cozy as we please. Oh, you dear creature, you don't know how glad I am to have you with me again!"</p>
               <p>"I think I do, Kitty, for I am quite as glad to see you again, and to know that we can enjoy a few days together before I enter on the slavery to which I have bound myself."</p>
               <p>"It's a shame that you should be forced to take such a position, dear, but it won't last long. You'll be sure to find a rich lover at Newport; but I tell you he must be a New York man, for I can't afford to let you live anywhere else."</p>
               <p>She threw open the door of a large room, elegantly fitted up with blue and silver; a bay window opened on a pleasant green yard, shaded with trees, and the soft summer air floated through the apartment. Books, pictures, and a guitar were found there, and through an open door Nina saw the exquisitely arranged bed-room beyond. She laughed, and said:</p>
               <p>"This is rather different from the plain dormitory we shared together in New Haven. O, Kitty, you should bless the gods for having given you such a home and such advantages as you possess."</p>
               <p>Kitty tenderly replied:</p>
               <p>"I only wish that I could share them with you, Nina. If you were only my sister, now, how much happier I should be. But I don't despair of claiming you as such yet. I think such a trio as you, I, and Dolly will make, will prove more than a match for pa and ma."</p>
               <p>Nina laughed, lifted her finger warningly, and said:</p>
               <p>"Don't begin to plot treason as soon as I have made my advent here, Kitty, or some evil may come of it. I intend to make the best impression on your father and mother, and you know with me there's no such word as fail."</p>
               <p>"So much the better; I hope everything from this visit. As soon as you have arranged your toilette we'll go to mamma's morning-room. She is really anxious to see you, and judge if my encomiums are deserved. No danger of disappointment there, I fancy, Nina?"</p>
               <p>With a bright smile, Nina turned from the glass before which she had been arranging her magnificent hair, and said:</p>
               <p>"I am ready for the ordeal now, my dear, and I cannot say that I am very nervous as to its result. I believe I shall make your mother like me."</p>
               <p>"You are right to have confidence in yourself, for you are irresistible!" And Kitty kissed her friend enthusiastically, and led the way toward the sitting-room of Mrs. Bates. She cherished a vague hope that when Nina became known to her parents they would be so much charmed by her as to retain her as <emph>her</emph> companion through the summer campaign about to commence, leaving Mrs. Hawks to find a substitute as she best could.</p>
               <p>They found the mistress of the house reclining on a sofa, languidly fanning herself. She half rose when the two girls went in, and held out a large hand that felt clammy to the touch, to welcome her daughter's friend.</p>
               <p>Nina saw before her a heavy, sallow-looking woman, dressed in the extreme of fashion, with natural flowers in her faded hair, and a tinge of rouge upon her withered cheeks.</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6338-00000027"/>
               <p>In an affected fine-lady manner Mrs. Bates said:</p>
               <p>"So this is my Kitty's bosom friend; the chosen of her young and guileless heart. I am very happy to see you in my house, Miss Gordon, and be sure that we shall do all that is in our power to make your time pass pleasantly while you are with us."</p>
               <p>Nina took the dumpy hand in both of her own, pressed it warmly, and in her sweetest manner replied:</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear madam, but it will be happiness enough to be with my darling Kitty once more. I have felt so lost since she left school that I could no longer make myself contented there without her. She has doubtless told you how much we were to each other."</p>
               <p>"Yes; she has talked to me by the hour of your kindness to her. She says that you helped her in her studies, and I'm sure I'm very grateful to you for aiding Kitty to get through creditably. I don't overrate my girl, Miss Gordon and I know that she's too much like me to have much fondness for books. That don't matter now, however, for with her other advantages she can get along well enough without addling her poor brains about what she'll never understand. Her father would have her taught what other people's daughters in our position learn, and she was sent away from me all those years because he insisted that I would indulge her too much, and interfere when I thought the poor thing was attempting more than was good for her. But she's come back to me just as good and affectionate as she was before she went away, thank Heaven."</p>
               <p>This long speech had evidently been arranged beforehand, and although the language was good enough, the pronunciation and manner of the speaker convinced Nina that until wealth flowed into the coffers of Mr. Bates, his wife had occupied an inferior position in life.</p>
               <p>There was also an affectation of fine-ladyism which at another time, and under different circumstances, would have afforded scope for her peculiar satirical talent, but at present it was her cue to please one who could so materially further her own views, and in the half hour before dinner spent with Mrs. Bates, Nina so favorably impressed that lady, that she went the length of regretting that the danger of her son and heir falling a prey to the enchantress must preclude all thought of asking her to remain with them as Kitty's companion.</p>
               <p>In the course of their conversation Nina learned that Mr. Adolphus Bates was absent on an excursion of pleasure, and had no intention of joining them till the close of the Newport season. His mother said that he had preferred going to Nahant with a party of his young friends, and Nina felt sure that such an arrangement had been suggested by his parents after learning that she was also going to Newport.</p>
               <p>She smiled brightly as her eyes fell on the reflection of her fair face in an opposite mirror, and determined in her own mind that all their precautions should prove vain if no better fish came to her net than their darling son.</p>
               <p>Meet him she would, fascinate him she knew she could, and that once accomplished she had no doubts as to the brilliant result to herself.</p>
               <p>She went back with Kitty to her chamber to change her dress before dinner. She took as much pains with her toilette as if the son in place of the father was to decide on her appearance; and the result was a success. The pale azure muslin, with ribbons to match, was exquisitely becoming to her radiant complexion and fair hair, and with such foils as Mrs. Bates and Kitty, Nina thought that the rounded grace of her person, the sparkling vivacity of her expressive face, must surely produce their due effect on the old gentleman.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6338-00000028"/>
               <p>She descended to the dining-room arm-in-arm with Kitty, who took her up at once to a fat, bald-headed man who was reading the evening paper. He was a pompous-looking personage, with a purple face, and a hanging under lip, which he constantly caressed with his left hand, on the smallest finger of which a brilliant diamond glittered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates put down his gold eye-glass, and said:</p>
               <p>"Eh—what is it, Kit? What are you saying?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa, come out of your brown study about prices and things that have no interest to me. This is Nina. Look at her and tell me that you think her charming."</p>
               <p>"Eh?—what—sure enough. I remember now you said something about expecting her. Quite a pleasure, I am sure, to see you here, Miss Gordon. My daughter has talked so much about you that I seem to know you quite well. I hope you'll make yourself at home while you stay in my house."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir; Kitty has already made me feel as if I am as welcome as a sister."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates cast a piercing glance from his small, deep-set eyes on the fair face of the speaker, and pondered a moment on the interpretation that was to be put on her words, but her expression was so sweet and composed that he dismissed all thought of a covert meaning, and undertook to make himself agreeable in his own way, to his daughter's friend.</p>
               <p>He had been the architect of his own fortune, and was not ashamed of the obscurity of his earlier days. In truth, Mr. Bates was rather proud of the fact that he had worked his way up to his present position from the lowest round of the social ladder, and made himself what he was by the exercise of his own shrewdness and industry.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates took her seat at the upper end of the table, but she left her husband to do the honors of the feast to their young guest, declaring that she was too much overcome come by the heat to do more than smile languidly upon the three who laughed and chattered around her.</p>
               <p>Kitty was in the gayest spirits, and never had Nina so successfully exerted herself to please. In his clumsy way, Mr. Bates was facetious, and the trio were as merry together as good humor and good wine could make them.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman imbibed freely from his south side Maderia, and the rosy lips of the younger ladies sipped champagne, which the merchant declared to be of the true vintage.</p>
               <p>When dinner was at last over, they adjourned to the spacious drawing-room, which was magnificently fitted up, and opened into a smaller apartment hung with what Mr. Bates called the old masters.</p>
               <p>While on a commercial trip to Europe, the gentleman had been deluded into buying a lot of dingy-looking pictures, so darkened by time that it was often difficult to discover the subject treated, but they were labelled with the great names of Italian and Spanish art, and he was quite satisfied that they were the genuine productions of Claude, Salvator Rosa, Murillo and other great masters.</p>
               <p>Profoundly ignorant of art himself, it yet afforded the pompous old man great satisfaction to display the gems he had secured, and descant on them to any one that would patiently listen to his absurd remarks.</p>
               <p>He took Nina into this cabinet of horrors, and exhibited to her distorted virgins, impossible landscapes, and several interiors dimly discernible through the dark varnish with which they had been encrusted. At length Mr. Bates paused before a figure of St. Lawrence roasting on his gridiron. The drawing of this was frightfully true, and the contortions of the poor martyr's face and figure were sufficient to fill a spectator with horror. He said:</p>
               <p>"That's a fine thing, though I don't know who painted<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6338-00000029"/> it. The man I bought it from said it was Paul very uneasy; and I should think he was, poor fellow. But it was something new to me that the Apostle Paul ever suffered in that way. I ain't much of a Bible man myself, but I've looked in the New Testament, and I couldn't find any account of it; but it is a Catholic legend, I suppose. They tell a great many things about the ancient Christians that we Protestants don't pay much attention to."</p>
               <p>Nina repressed the mocking smile that rose to her sarcastic lips, and gently said:</p>
               <p>"I think the man who sold it to you, sir, meant that Paul Veronese was the painter. I do not remember this among the list of his productions, but it may be as genuine as any of the rest."</p>
               <p>"Paul Veryoneasy—I wonder if a man ever really existed with such a name as that? Don't be taking <emph>me</emph> off, Miss Gordon, if you please; for you'll find me rather a hard bargain if you do."</p>
               <p>Nina laughed, blushed, and deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"I am quite in earnest, and if you have an encyclopedia about the house I can show you the name of the great painter, with the list of his works. We can then see if a St. Lawrence is among them, for that is the true name of your martyr, Mr. Bates."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, I shall have to take your word for both, for I only patronize ledgers, and Kitty and the old lady read nothing but newspapers—I believe I'll get the thing you spoke of though, for it will be good to have something to tell me about the painter fellows that did all this lot. Between you and me, though, I like the pictures in our own exhibition better, and they wouldn't have cost me half as much as these did. I can't see why a painting being old should be such a recommendation."</p>
               <p>"Nor I either," replied Nina, with perfect sincerity, for she thought any daub would be preferable to such specimens of ancient art as those before her.</p>
               <p>Kitty here joined them, and said:</p>
               <p>"I hope you have enjoyed the exhibition, Nina, as pa meant you should; but really to me this room is a dreadful nightmare. It is 'grand, gloomy, and peculiar,' I suppose, for I can't look at one of these pictures without an inward shiver. Come, dear, give us some music, and let us forget all about the poor wretch stretched on the live coals yonder. If I had <emph>my</emph> way, I'd send <emph>him</emph> out of the house at all risks."</p>
               <p>"You'd do a very foolish thing then, Miss Bates, for that piece of canvas cost me just ten thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>Kitty shrugged her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"So much the worse for you, pa. I'm afraid that you illustrated the old proverb, which I am too dutiful to quote."</p>
               <p>"Eh! 'a fool and his money soon parted,' I suppose you mean, you saucy girl. But what do I care for money? I've more than I know what to do with."</p>
               <p>And with this magnificent boast, Mr. Bates returned to the drawing-room, and listened complacently to the sweet and well trained voice of Miss Gordon, till it was time to go out for an evening engagement.</p>
               <p>The next few days of Nina's life were spent in a whirl of pleasant excitement. The mornings were devoted to shopping, and she had the delight so dear to all young girls, of selecting an elegant wardrobe for the summer campaign she was meditating.</p>
               <p>The loveliest evening dresses were selected, and taken to the most fashionable mantua-maker, who, to accommodate Miss Bates, promised to have them in readiness by the time they would be needed.</p>
               <p>The afternoons were spent in driving out with Kitty in her father's superb equipage, and attended by a footman in livery.</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6338-00000030"/>
               <p>Their evenings were spent at some place of fashionable amusement, and more than one opera-glass was levelled at the new face in the box of the rich merchant, and inquiry made among the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">elite</foreign> of the Bates' set, as to who that fine girl was who threw poor Kitty completely in the shade.</p>
               <p>No one could tell with certainty, but it was soon whispered that the fair stranger was a relation of Mrs. Bates, and worth so much that there was no telling the amount of her fortune.</p>
               <p>This <foreign xml:lang="FRA">canard</foreign> grew out of a reply made by Kitty to one of her admirers, when he asked who Miss Gordon was.</p>
               <p>She, laughingly, replied:</p>
               <p>"I shan't tell you everything about her, but that she is worth more than you and me put together, Mr. Lorimer."</p>
               <p>As Tom Lorimer's property was valued at a hundred thousand, and he thought more of his money than he did of himself, he at once jumped to the conclusion that Nina was a great fortune, and reported it accordingly.</p>
               <p>When Kitty became aware of the delusion, she encouraged it; and Nina, when told of the wealth with which rumor endowed her, replied, with a cynical laugh:</p>
               <p>"I <emph>may</emph> be a great heiress for aught I know to the contrary. Money enough was lavished on me in my early days to make me think so; but I am poor enough just now. Do you know, dear, that I have spent five hundred dollars since I came to New York, and that sum is exactly half of all I possess in the world?"</p>
               <p>"Who cares for that, Nina, darling? Your face is your fortune, and, if I were one of the lordly sex, it would be be quite enough for me. This stupid report may help you on, so I shan't quarrel with Tom Lorimer, for starting it. You shall make a grand match this summer, and then you will have the fortune that is now only a myth."</p>
               <p>Nina shook her head.</p>
               <p>"I shall soon be found out, and perhaps meet the fate of the jay that decked herself in borrowed plumes. At Newport it must soon become known that I am only the paid companion of Mrs. Hawks, and we shall see what we shall see."</p>
               <p>Kitty gleefully responded:</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have settled all that in my own mind. I shall speak of you as a relative of Mrs. Hawks, and as she has lived in absolute retirement since she came to New York to consult physicians about her bodily ailments, there will be nobody to contradict me. The old lady is too much afflicted to appear in public or to receive strangers, and as she is slightly hard of hearing, she will never know what a pleasant fiction I have devised to enable her companion to make a sensation at Newport. During the day you must perforce perform the part of the devoted attendant, but at night you shall reign a queen. That's a bright idea of mine, I think."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid it won't do, my dear, for only think what the result may be to me, if it is discovered that I give countenance to such an imposition."</p>
               <p>"Stuff! imposition, indeed! It would be a much worse one if you were really related to that insufferable old woman, who is going to victimize you so many hours out of the twenty-four. Do <emph>you</emph> only remain passive, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chere,</foreign> and leave the rest to me. I promise not to tell a single fib. I shall only leave that stupid Mr. Lorimer, to enlarge on my hints. His imagination is boundless, and we shall soon have you as much the rage as if you were a princess in disguise."</p>
               <p>Nina was quite ready for anything that promised to give her a footing in the brilliant sphere she was so anxious to enter, so she laughed and said, "Nonsense;" but she did not prohibit the very questionable method of serving her devised by her unscupulous friend.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6338-00000031"/>
               <p>The luxurious life she now led for the first time had many attractions for her; she loved splendor; her temperament led her to value worldly success, and the prestige it bestows; and surrounded by luxury, she thought she could yet be happy, even without the love of Godfrey Fenton. So she went blindly forward in the path her friend had so adroitly opened for her.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">NINA IN HER TRUE ELEMENT.</head>
               <p>THE time for Nina's leaving her new friends came all too soon. One morning a curt note came from Mrs. Hawks to Miss Gordon, addressed to the care of Mrs. Bates. In that she informed Nina that in two more days she would receive her, and on the third one they would set out for Newport together.</p>
               <p>The note was sent to be forwarded to Nina, for the good lady had no idea that her expected companion had been enjoying the hospitalities of the Bates' mansion for the last week.</p>
               <p>"What does she say?" asked Kitty, with a long face, as Nina threw the paper down, with a cloud on the fair brow.</p>
               <p>"Only what I anticipated; that my brief holiday is over, and I must begin to earn my bread again. But I have two days of grace, so let us enjoy them as we best can."</p>
               <p>Kitty brightened.</p>
               <p>"Two whole days! that is a reprieve. I was afraid that you were to go at once. We leave town next week, so the separation will not be for long. We must see about your dresses, and all the minor accessories of your toilette, for that is of the last importance in the part I intend you to play."</p>
               <p>"But, Kitty, how is it that you never seem to think of yourself? You are always planning for me, but care nothing about your own success. I will say that you are the most unselfish girl I ever knew."</p>
               <p>"Oh, as to <emph>me,</emph> you know that pa will settle everything for me in his own way, unless I take a fancy to some poor man, and insist on having mine. I have already been stupid enough to do that, but <emph>you</emph> haven't seen Albert Tompkins—he is only pa's head clerk, and, as ma says, has a very vulgar name, so I suppose nothing will come of it. To tell you the truth, I have more attention than I care about, and I'm tired of the nonsense talked to me. I mean to have my own way in this, Nina, and oh! won't it be fun to throw gold dust in the eyes of interested wooers, who will some day find out that it was only sand."</p>
               <p>A frown contracted the smooth brow of Nina, and she abruptly replied:</p>
               <p>"I am obliged to you, of course, Kitty, for trying to serve me in the best way you can, but I am afraid that we are both venturing on ground that will give way beneath our feet when we least expect it. I would not marry a man who rested under such a delusion, and if he shewed any wish to retract after the truth became known to him, I do not think that I should attempt to hold him bound. So it occurs to me that the fun you anticipate may end in grief to me."</p>
               <p>"How should it, if I can carry out all my plans? I'll tell you the whole truth, Nina, because it isn't fair to set you up as the prize to be won, and keep you in the dark as to who I intend to be the winner I have settled it in my own mind that you are to be my sister—that is, my brother's wife; and Dolly is already more than half in love with you<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6338-00000032"/> from my description. But he is vain as a peacock, and says when he gets a wife she must reflect honor and all that nonsense on his choice. He wouldn't look at Venus herself if his particular set did not recognize her as the queen of beauty and fascination, and he would pay homage to Medusa if his friends declared her to be charming. Can't you see, dear, that all you have to do is to make yourself the goddess of Lorimer and all that clique, and Dolly will come in and try to cut them out? Not in vain either, I hope, for he is as rich as any of them, and in spite of his foppery has some good in him. He and I understand each other, and when we are fairly settled at Newport, Dolly will run down from Nahant and make some excuse that will satisfy ma. By the time he comes pa will be safe back here, for he will never stay over three days at a watering-place; he says they bore him to death."</p>
               <p>Nina listened to this explanation without much surprise, for it had long been the most ardent wish of Kitty to bring about a match between herself and her brother, and they had often laughingly discussed the theme in their school days. But she now demurely said:</p>
               <p>"That nonsense was well enough, Kitty, when we were little more than children; but now I can plainly see that it will not do. Your parents would oppose such a marriage, even if your brother should wish to make it. He is dependent on your father, and of course I could not consent to be the means of injuring his future prospects."</p>
               <p>"Pa would not hold out long, for Dolly can do anything with him that he chooses. Besides, you are mistaken in supposing that my brother is dependent on him. He owns one half the business, and is entitled to an equal share in the profits. He was named for my uncle, ma's brother, and when he died unmarried two years ago, he left all his share in the firm to Dolly, to be his when he is twenty-five years old. He lacks but a few weeks of that age, and next month he will come into possession of a fine fortune.</p>
               <p>Nina listened with vivid interest to these details, and Kitty went on:</p>
               <p>"It is true that pa could turn him out of the firm if his marriage displeased him; that would be a pity, for the wine trade in which they are engaged is immensely profitable, but he couldn't do anything more."</p>
               <p>This was presenting a new and more attractive phase to the position of Mr. Adolphus Bates, and Nina smiled brightly as she replied:</p>
               <p>"You dear, good Kitty, then you really wish to claim me as your sister. I love <emph>you</emph> very dearly, my darling, and if your brother only resembles you, I shall find him irresistible. But courted and flattered as Adolphus must be, there is little chance that he will waste a thought on me. I wish you had not spoken of this to me, Kitty, for it places me in a false position toward Mr. Bates, and may mar such efforts to please as I might otherwise make."</p>
               <p>"I told you on purpose that you may be as indifferent as you please. The less desire you show to attract him, the more anxious will Dolly become to make an impression on you. He fights shy of the girls, as he expresses it, because they make such a fuss over him that he thinks they all want to marry him."</p>
               <p>"Precious coxcomb!" thought Nina, but she wreathed her arm around the form of her friend, and smiling softly, said:</p>
               <p>"To become your sister would be supreme happiness, but I cannot consent to enter into your plans, my dear, because doing so would bring discord in a home I found happy and united. Let us talk no more on this subject, if you please, Kitty, for it is one on which we can never agree. I promise to be your brother's friend, but to the position of his wife I must not aspire."</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6338-00000033"/>
               <p>"Nonsense!" replied Kitty, with emphasis. "Only wait till Dolly joins us, and then we shall see what will happen. He can't help falling in love with you, and if he asks you to have him, I am sure you won't say no."</p>
               <p>At this crisis a servant came to announce that the carriage was at the door, and Kitty forgot her interest in the reply of Nina in her anxiety to prepare for the drive. The morning was spent chiefly among the mantua makers, and dresses were fitted and trimmings were discussed with that acumen peculiar to young ladies who eagerly desire that their robes shall not only be of the most becoming style, but made up in the very latest fashion.</p>
               <p>An hour was lounged away in shopping, and another hundred dollars of Nina's hardly earned money was paid for some exquisite lace, while Kitty spent twice the amount on four embroidered handkerchiefs, two of which she presented to her friend on their return home.</p>
               <p>Nina accepted them without hesitation, for she regarded such a present as a mere bagatelle from one so abounding in wealth as her fortunate friend.</p>
               <p>That evening they went to the theatre, and had quite a brilliant succession of beaux to visit their box; for the grace, vivacity, and tact of Miss Gordon had already won her much popularity in the fashionable set to which the wealth of Mr. Bates had opened an entrance to his family.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates was not well enough to go out herself, but a young married friend of Kitty's, as giddy and thoughtless as herself, undertook to chaperone the two young girls, and a gay trio they made. Mrs. Linden's husband, a rather fast young man, was their escort, and the whole party enjoyed the freedom from elderly espionage which was rarely accorded them; for they lived with Linden's parents, who usually kept a strict watch over the young couple, who, the truth to tell, were scarcely wise enough to be left to their own devices.</p>
               <p>The performance of a new drama, translated from the French, had attracted quite a crowd; the performance was good, but the talking that went on among Mrs. Linden's party might have induced one to believe that they came to enjoy social conversation rather than the entertainment provided for them.</p>
               <p>Nina made unsuccessful efforts to listen to what was passing on the stage, but finally gave up the attempt and entered into the spirit of what was going on around her, regardless of the annoyed looks of those within hearing of the murmured conversation and stifled laughter they indulged themselves in.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Linden aroused the curiosity of the two girls by announcing a surprise she had in store for them, and various guesses were hazarded as to its nature.</p>
               <p>She finally said:</p>
               <p>"Harry has made arrangements for a supper, after the play is over. We shall have a private room, and <emph>somebody</emph> that you little expect to see will be there, Kitty. It is not often that Harry and I get our freedom, but when we do, we generally make a pretty good use of it."</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> is a matter of opinion, Mrs. Linden," said Mr. Lorimer, who had joined them soon after they came in. "I suspect that your respected father-in-law would think such an arrangement anything but <emph>good.</emph> I, however, do not agree in opinion with him, and I shall drink to your spirit in the fine wine I anticipate as a part of the feast."</p>
               <p>"But who are we to see?" asked Kitty eagerly; "I am sure that I can't think of any one I am particularly anxious to meet."</p>
               <p>"Yet you will be delighted—enchanted by the advent of <emph>my</emph> guest. I sha'n't give you a clue to him, so you need not ask another question!"</p>
               <p>Toward the close of the evening, the curtains of the stage<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6338-00000034"/> box were suddenly swept aside, and a gentleman who had been concealed behind them levelled his opera glass full upon the group, dwelling longest on the face of Nina as if forming an estimate of its powers of attraction.</p>
               <p>She soon became aware of this, and, after a moment's hesitation, coolly lifted her own glass and surveyed him in her turn.</p>
               <p>She saw a short, stoutly-built young man, with dark hair and eyes, a large nose, and a lower lip the very counterpart of that of Mr. Bates, for his chin was closely shaved, though he wore a long, curved moustache on his upper lip.</p>
               <p>His dress was in the extreme of fashion, and diamond studs glittered upon the embroidered bosom his satin vest disclosed. Before Nina's survey was completed, her attention was drawn away from him by an exclamation from Kitty:</p>
               <p>"I declare it is—yes, it is Dolly! He has come back from Nahant without letting any of us know,—and there he is. I understand now, Mrs. Linden—my brother is to join our party, to-night."</p>
               <p>"Yes; he has perversely chosen to spoil the surprise I had planned; but it does not matter, Mr. Bates always does as he pleases."</p>
               <p>Finding that he had been recognized, Mr. Adolphus Bates came round and entered their box. He was welcomed with much <foreign xml:lang="FRA">empressement,</foreign> and Kitty hastened to present him to her friend.</p>
               <p>On a nearer view, Nina found him a blended likeness of his father and sister, but she thought his manner insufferably patronizing as he extended a finger to one and another of his friends, and affectedly said:</p>
               <p>"It's pleasant to find a fellow appreciated as you seem to appreciate me after my brief absence. I wonder now how much of it is due to my own personality or to the solvency of Bates &amp; Son. Eh, Lorimer?"</p>
               <p>"Very much to the latter, be sure," was the consoling reply of that gentleman. "If I hadn't a shilling, I shouldn't expect anything but kicks and cuffs. It's the way of the world, you know, Dolly, and you know I'm no better than many a poor d——l I have seen snubbed because he hadn't the luck to have rich progenitors. 'The sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children,' the preachers tell us; but if they take the form of sharpness in money-getting, I believe their consequences are easily borne. Don't you think so, my dear fellow?"</p>
               <p>"I have not made up my mind; that such is the opinion of Gotham is abundantly evident, though few people care to be as candid as you are, Lorry. Have you thought about this intricate question, Miss Gordon?"</p>
               <p>He turned squarely toward Nina, fixing his small, deep-set eyes upon her charming face. With perfect coolness, she replied:</p>
               <p>"I have, and very gravely, and I rather incline to Mr. Lorimer's opinion. 'Get money, <emph>honorably, if you can,</emph> but get it at any rate,' as a father is reputed to have once said to his son, is the creed of most of the strugglers after fortune, I am afraid. An unstained name is a good thing, but a respectable fortune seems to me to be quite as desirable."</p>
               <p>"So you think the two incompatible?" asked young Bates, with a keener look than before.</p>
               <p>"By no means; that would be stigmatising every successful man as a dishonorable one. I was only balancing one good thing against another, and I am afraid that I rather incline to Mr. Lorimer's views."</p>
               <p>"Unlike most young ladies, then, you do not profess a noble scorn of sordid lucre?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed, no; for my tastes are magnificent and I cherish the most unbounded contempt for all the twaddle that has<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6338-00000035"/> been sung and said about love in a cottage. Nothing less than a palace, and a very <foreign xml:lang="FRA">recherche</foreign> one too, will satisfy my ambition."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates widened his small eyes at this frank avowal, which, coming from a young girl he knew to be destitute of fortune, was at least something new in his experience. He was mystified by the remark Lorimer now made.</p>
               <p>"You can afford to speak thus, Miss Gordon, for few are so nobly endowed with this world's pelf as your pretty self. See how poetic the subject has made me. I am actually speaking in numbers when I meant to utter only the plainest prose."</p>
               <p>Kitty saw the expression of surprise that came over her brother's face, and she bent toward him, and whispered a few words in his ear. He took a seat beside her, and the two carried on an earnest conversation a few moments, while the others turned their attention to the stage.</p>
               <p>Kitty at length asked:</p>
               <p>"What brought you back from Nahant so soon, and why did you not come home to see ma?"</p>
               <p>He laughed.</p>
               <p>"That would have spoiled all. I came back on the sly, and I don't intend the old man to know that I have been in the city at all. I found Nahant dull, and I was curious to see and judge of the pink of perfection over yonder that you have raved about so long. I met Linden at the depot, and he told me you would be here to-night, and go to a supper given by him and his wife afterward. I accepted his invitation to join you, but preferred coming here alone to make my own observations."</p>
               <p>"And with what result, pray? Though I scarcely need ask; there can be but one opinion as to the beauty and fascinations I have described."</p>
               <p>He coolly went on:</p>
               <p>"I have been watching her all the evening, and, by the mass! the girl seems to have something in her. The fellows of our set seem to be quite taken with her, but that is explained by her supposed fortune. You are really getting clever, Kitty. Who would have expected such a plot from a matter-of-fact young woman like you?"</p>
               <p>"Pooh! why should you call it by such a name? It was no plot of mine, but originated in one of Mr. Lorimer's blunders. He is always misinterpreting what one says, you know, and I only gave him the slightest foundation for his golden embroideries. If his absurd chatter can help Nina to secure a good footing in society I do not care what he says."</p>
               <p>"And your friend? Pray what is her opinion about trading under false pretences?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Dolly, how can you speak in such a way of one I love so dearly? My darling Nina is the soul of honor, as you would understand if I had time to repeat to you all she said on this subject. I'll tell you some other time."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates shrugged his shoulders incredulously; but he said:</p>
               <p>"I'll take it all on trust, so you need not trouble yourself. She's pretty enough to make a man forget her faults, and she seems to have that spice of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">diablerie</foreign> in her, without which your sex is tame and uninteresting to me. The truth is, I ran down here to see if it would be worth while to risk the governor's displeasure by coming to Newport after you are established there. You heard how solemnly he warned me against getting into a sentimental entanglement with your fair friend, but the warning had its usual effect. It only made me more curious to see and judge of the charming Nina myself."</p>
               <p>"You find her charming, then?"</p>
               <p>"Of course I do, or I should hardly have come over here<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6338-00000036"/> to join you. So here goes for cutting out those other fellows."</p>
               <p>He coolly rose, and laying his hand on the shoulder of Lorimer, who was playing the devoted to Nina, said:</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, I never tolerate monopolies. Pray allow me a chance to prove to Miss Gordon what an agreeable companion I can make myself. You return to your old allegiance, to Kitty, for I am afraid she is becoming jealous at seeing the old love cast off for the new."</p>
               <p>This cool assurance was received by both friend and sister as something very witty. They both laughed, and Kitty at once made room for Lorimer to sit beside herself. She only said:</p>
               <p>"We are the best of friends, Mr. Lorimer, and Dolly's nonsense won't make us either blush or quarrel. Let us listen to what is going on on the stage now, for I am really ashamed of the little attention I have given it."</p>
               <p>"I am quite willing to be on my good behavior, Miss Kitty, but as I've seen the piece played before it hasn't much interest for me."</p>
               <p>"I know—you only come here because it is the fashion just now. But I really love good acting, and the leading stars are doing their best to-night in spite of our inattention."</p>
               <p>Nina's ears were singularly sharp, and while affecting to be absorbed by what was passing on the stage, she had managed to catch the meaning of the greater part of the low-toned conversation that had been carried on behind her. At some portions of it her blood tingled in her veins,—but she mastered her wrath, and when young Bates took his place beside her she smiled softly on him, and began to talk in her most fascinating manner.</p>
               <p>In the next hour she had uttered more nonsense, and given voice to more brilliant sophistries than he had ever before heard from the lips of one of her sex, and he began to ask himself if it would be quite safe to play with fire-brands where this young girl was to be his antagonist.</p>
               <p>But there was something piquante about her, and Mr. Bates thought he would try it; he was thoroughly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">blazè</foreign> with the past life he had led since his twentieth year, and this new phase of woman afforded him a pleasant excitement—a desideratum he was always seeking, and seldom found.</p>
               <p>When the play was ended the party adjourned to the supper, which proved a very brilliant little affair. Under the influence of sparkling champagne, many silly and some bright things were said. Nina was the life of the company. She travestied the sentimental scenes to which they had so lately listened—gave imitations of the actresses, and then burlesqued them in the most laughable manner; and young Bates pronounced her acting unrivalled.</p>
               <p>Adolphus declared his intention to return to Boston on the early train, and exacted from the two girls a promise that his nocturnal visit to his native city should not be mentioned at home.</p>
               <p>At parting, he pressed Nina's hand, and in a low voice said:</p>
               <p>"I shall see you soon again, Miss Gordon, for I shall make it a point to join my mother at Newport in a very short time. With such a magnet as will <emph>then</emph> be there I could scarcely remain away."</p>
               <p>"I shall not be with your mother, Mr. Bates," she replied, with a wicked smile of triumph, as she glanced archly in his face; nor shall I be classed among the idlers, you know."</p>
               <p>"I know only that you are the most charming of women, and I shall follow whithersover you may go. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir, belle Nina.</foreign>"</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6338-00000037"/>
               <p>Mrs. Linden took the young ladies home in her own carriage, as the Bates' equipage had been sent back with private orders to a servant to sit up till their return, and admit them without the knowledge of Mr. Bates or his wife; so the elders remained in blissful ignorance of the dissipation which had followed the evening's entertaintment.</p>
               <p>Kitty would not allow it to be spoken of, because she feared that her mother would not again trust her to as giddy a chaperone as Mrs. Linden, and Miss Bates particularly liked to go out with that thoughtless and good-natured little woman.</p>
               <p>When she and Nina were safe in the room they jointly occupied, Kitty said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, dear! what would pa say if he knew what has happened to-night? He thinks it dreadful for young people to be fast, and I am afraid that what we've been doing comes under that head. It's a pity it's so pleasant to be wicked, for I never enjoyed any grand party as much in my life as I did this supper to-night. Everything was in such exquisite taste, and the company so agreeable."</p>
               <p>"Especially Mr. Linden, when he began to sing in that half tipsy manner," said Nina, maliciously.</p>
               <p>"Well, he did make himself a goose; but he is the best natured creature alive, and I won't have you quarrel with him. <emph>You</emph> were the bright particular star of the evening, Nina, and I never before saw you half so entertaining. The travestie you gave of scenes from Camille was delightful, and I believe you could burlesque the whole thing if you tried."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I could; but I am tired to death by my exertions to please, and I can with truth say with the poet: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Now my weary lips I close,</l>
                        <l>Leave, oh, leave me to repose.'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> "I am half sorry that I mimicked good Mrs. Lyme, but you insisted on it, Kitty."</p>
               <p>"She'll never know it, dear, so your conscience need not hurt you. Shall I tell you what Dolly said?"</p>
               <p>"If you choose."</p>
               <p>"He declares that you are magnificent—unsurpassed; that you could drive away a whole legion of blue devils; and as they are his special affliction, I shouldn't be surprised if he were to ask you to exorcise them for him during all the rest of his life."</p>
               <p>"That would be a difficult task for any woman to undertake," murmured Nina, in a sleepy tone. "Don't say another word to me, Kitty, for I am floating away on a voyage to the land of Nod."</p>
               <p>In another moment she seemed to be sound asleep, and Kitty was soon slumbering beside her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE NEW PATRONESS.</head>
               <p>AFTER one more day of pleasure and excitement, Nina Gordon, with bitter and rebellious feelings, prepared to lay aside the character of a petted guest, and take on herself that of the paid companion of Mrs. Hawks.</p>
               <p>Up to the last moment of her stay in Mr. Bates' house, she had cherished the hope that Kitty's parents would offer her a home with her friend; but no hint of such a purpose fell from either of them, and the disappointed schemer could have wept tears of rage and mortification over this first defeat in the plans she had formed. She vowed within her soul that all their precautions should not save their precious son from the snares she meant to lay for him when he again threw himself within the sphere of her fascinations.</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6338-00000038"/>
               <p>By the time she had completed the packing of her trunks for removal, she had quite made up her mind to accept him when she succeeded in bringing him to the point of a proposal.</p>
               <p>As so large a quantity of luggage as she now possessed might attract remark from her new patroness, Nina thought it expedient to leave the large trunk containing her evening dresses to be taken to Newport with Kitty's, as she intended to remain very quiet till her friends arrived.</p>
               <p>The two girls bewailed their fate at being separated even for a single week, and Kitty indignantly declared that she would do everything in her power to bring back her slighted friend to her father's roof as the daughter of the house.</p>
               <p>Both Mr. Bates and his wife were very well pleased to see Miss Gordon depart; for, in spite of her cleverness, her adroit flatteries, and the success she had achieved among their friends, they both intuitively distrusted her. She had several times been led on by Kitty to give before them most amusing imitations of the starched manner and precise address of good Mrs. Lyme; and although they laughed and enjoyed the fun of the exhibition, sober after thought induced them to suspect that, in their turn, they might serve as a caricature for the amusement of others, as the friend of her childhood had been used for theirs. If Nina would not spare her who had been almost a mother to her, how could they expect her to forbear toward friends of such recent date as themselves?</p>
               <p>So it was decided in solemn conclave between Mr. Bates and his wife that Miss Gordon was a dangerous inmate for more reasons than one; and it was finally determined that she should not be again invited to visit their daughter.</p>
               <p>Late on the afternoon of a lovely day, Nina took leave of her host and hostess, thanking them in the sweetest manner for the pleasant interlude to her dull life the visit to their house had afforded her; and she set out with Kitty to walk to the residence of Mrs. Hawks, which was in the next street.</p>
               <p>The brilliant butterfly of the last few days had laid aside her gossamer wings, and came out a "common grub," as she expressed it. She wore a plain travelling dress with linen collar and cuffs; a close straw bonnet, and thick veil, and seeing her demure step and quiet air, no one would have believed that the cynosure of that wild supper party enjoyed a few nights since, was the proper young lady who moved as if by rule, and spoke in the most carefully modulated tones.</p>
               <p>Just before they reached Mrs. Hawks' door, Kitty turned toward her with a laugh, and said:</p>
               <p>"I declare, Nina, you are the most perfect little Miss Prim I ever saw. Your destiny should have been the stage, for you can transform yourself into anything you choose. When I look at you and hear you speak, it seems to me that you can scarcely be the same girl who was ready for any sport only two days ago."</p>
               <p>To this Nina gravely replied:</p>
               <p>"It is necessary for even a practised actress to rehearse her part, and mine you know, is quite new to me. I have a dreadful ordeal before me, Kitty, and I must prepare myself for it as well as I can."</p>
               <p>"But you can console yourself with the thought that it will soon be over, darling. A few days of dullness and constraint, you must bear; then will come partial freedom, soon to be followed by what I have so long planned and hoped for. You shall come back here as Dolly's wife, have a fine house of your own, with carriages, servants and money at your command."</p>
               <p>Nina bitterly replied:</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6338-00000039"/>
               <p>"Oh! my dear, do not continue to cherish that delusion, for your parents have plainly shown me that they will never consent to such a mis-alliance on the part of your brother. Without their approbation, even if I loved Mr. Bates, and he adored me, I could not enter your family."</p>
               <p>"So you have always said, Nina; but I shall leave Dolly to fight his own battles, and I feel assured that he will come off with flying colors. But here we are at Mrs. Hawks' door, and there she is at the window looking out for us."</p>
               <p>The house was one of a brick row, with iron balconies in front of the windows, and a bright silver plate on the door bearing the name of its occupant. They ascended a flight of stone steps, and at the first sound of the bell, the door was opened by a grave-looking middle-aged woman, who ushered them at once into the presence of Mrs. Hawks.</p>
               <p>Reclining on a wide sofa was an elderly woman, who must have weighed over two hundred pounds, yet she had evidently once been much larger, for her skin had the flaccid appearance of a person who has lost much flesh. Her eyes had a singularly wild look, from the habit of opening them so widely as to show a distinct ring of white entirely around the dark orbit. But they had not lost all their old fire, as was evinced by the look of keen interest with which she surveyed her new companion.</p>
               <p>The gray hair was evenly parted, and hung in short spiral curls over her furrowed brow, and her shrunken lips closed over an artificial set of teeth, the pearly beauty of which formed a weird contrast with her worn and faded face.</p>
               <p>A small poodle, freshly combed and decorated with bows of blue ribbon, started up as the visitors entered, and commenced a series of sharp, ear-piercing yelps, and Nina, who cherished a great aversion to pets of any kind, wondered if this spiteful little cur was to become one of the torments of her new life.</p>
               <p>In a feeble, wavering voice, Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"Dear me, Miss Bates, I am very glad to see you, I am sure, but I—I hardly expected you to come yourself with the young person your mother so strongly recommended to me. You're very good, I must say, and I hope that Miss Gordon appreciates your kindness at its true value."</p>
               <p>To this, Kitty affably replied:</p>
               <p>"Pray permit me to present to you my <emph>friend</emph> and schoolmate, Miss Gordon. Her name is Nina, and she will like it better if you will call her by it. We were in New Haven together several years, and if it will recommend her to your good graces, let me say that I love her dearly."</p>
               <p>The hearing of Mrs. Hawks was considerably impaired, and she imperfectly caught the meaning of Kitty's words. She nodded her head and grimly said:</p>
               <p>"I hardly expected you to bring me a ninny, as my companion. That means a fool, don't it? But I must have been mistaken, for you'd hardly call the young girl a fool to her face. Besides, you say you went to school to her, and if she could teach you, she must know something. I shall want her to do something of that sort for me, for I've taken a fancy to go to Europe next year, and I want her to help me brush up my French before I go. It's as well to know something of their foreign gibberish before one goes among strange people."</p>
               <p>In a voice so highly pitched as to be painful to her, Kitty screamed:</p>
               <p>"You misunderstood me, Mrs. Hawks. I said that her name is Nina, and we were friends at school. I love her as if she were my sister, and she speaks French like a native Parisian."</p>
               <p>In an offended tone, the old lady said:</p>
               <p>"You need not roar at me like that, Miss Bates. I am not as deaf as a post, though a little hard of hearing.<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6338-00000040"/> Your friend parley voos like the nation, does she? You mean the French nation, of course, and I am very glad to hear it. You can take off your things, Miss Godfrey, and let me see how I like your looks. Be quiet, Bijou," which name she pronounced "Bijjer," at the same time striking a smart blow on the head of the favorite, who returned it with a snap.</p>
               <p>Nina obeyed the command as demurely as she had walked there. She took off her bonnet, and laying aside her mantle, stood in the slanting evening sunlight which fell through the open window, just in front of her new employer.</p>
               <p>As her eyes fell upon her face, Mrs. Hawks uttered a slight exclamation, and she rapidly asked:</p>
               <p>"Where did you come from? What is your name? I am not certain that I heard it right. You are wonderfully like a young woman I knew once."</p>
               <p>Nina took up a small porcelain slate that was lying on a table near the deaf woman, and wrote quite calmly:</p>
               <p>"I am called Nina Gordon. I am an orphan girl, educated for a teacher by an uncle who lives in the South. But as I do not like that employment, I have sought the situation of companion to you, Madam, and I shall do my best to be useful to you in that capacity."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks' lips relaxed in something like a smile at this evidence of self-possession, and she adjusted her eyeglasses to read the explanation offered. That done, she nodded her head and complacently said:</p>
               <p>"You will suit me, young woman. I see that you know what you are about. It's better to write than to split your throat bawling at me; not that I am so deaf as to need it, but people are so stupid they won't understand. They will speak so low that I can't make out a word, or they scream at me till I am so confused that I have no comprehension left. What's your uncle's name? I know a good many Southern people, and maybe I have met with him."</p>
               <p>"William Fairlie," was spoken in reply.</p>
               <p>"Fairlie Fairlie, His mother must have been a fool to have his name twice repeated, as if no other so good could be procured. I suppose, now, this Mr. Fairlie thinks great things of himself, yet he isn't above allowing his niece to go out in the world to make her own living. Isn't he a stuck up fogy, now?"</p>
               <p>Again Nina had recourse to the slate.</p>
               <p>"My uncle's name is William Fairlie, and I know nothing of him personally. I have never seen him since my earliest childhood, and I retain no recollection of him."</p>
               <p>"Umph! so much the better. He's a mean hunks, or he wouldn't leave a young creature like you to make her own way in life. Sit down, child, I have taken a fancy to you, for you look wonderfully like Anna Moore, a girl who was raised and educated with my sister and myself. But that was a long time ago, and she's married to a man well to do, and has half-a-dozen children of her own. But I'll bet that not one of them looks more like what Anna used to be than you do."</p>
               <p>This statement put an end to the interest with which Nina had listened to her first words. She wrote:</p>
               <p>"Resemblances cannot be accounted for and mine must not be a common face, for this is not the first time I have reminded strangers of friends they had known."</p>
               <p>"No, it's not a common face," snapped the old lady in reply. "It's a very remarkable one, and I dare say that before this you've found some one to tell you that it's a pretty one, too. But that is nothing to the purpose; I think you will suit me very well, Miss Gordon, and you won't have much to do. Perkins, my maid, waits on me, and takes care of Bijjer. You will write my notes and<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6338-00000041"/> letters, settle my bills, order my dresses, and see that they are properly made; and you'll play cards and backgammon with me. I can't understand what people are talking about, and I never go into society; but if you can find anything amusing to say to me you can write it on my slate. It was very clever in you to know at once what it was put there for."</p>
               <p>Nina returned her thanks, and assured her new patroness that she would do her best to please her. She said she was very apt at learning games, and already played back-gammon well enough to interest her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks nodded, and smiled in her grim fashion, and, turning to Kitty, said:</p>
               <p>"I am much obliged to your mother for finding such a nice young girl to stay with me. You can tell her so, Miss Bates, and I will do the same when I see her at Newport."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that you are pleased, Mrs. Hawks; but neither ma nor I doubted that you would like Nina, and be glad to keep her with you."</p>
               <p>"I think I shall, my dear, she's better than the last one at any rate; for Miss Briggs was so strict in her notions about cards, that, in place of trying to learn such games as could amuse me, she took to writing lectures on my slate on the sinfulness of doing the only thing that a deaf old body like me <emph>can</emph> do to pass away the time. I told her that she was a strait-laced dunce, and ordered her to go about her business, as I hadn't any use for such a drone as she was. She wouldn't go till this afternoon, and then she had the impudence to give me a tract on the enormity of gambling, as if <emph>I</emph> did anything as disgraceful as that. I flatly told her to take her pamphlet away and never to set her foot in my house again. I am not going to put up with such impertinence from any one, and certainly not from one who eats my bread. I hope that you are not troubled with any such nonsense, Miss Gordon?"</p>
               <p>Nina shook her head and smiled so brightly that a gleam of something like pleasure came into the sallow face of Mrs. Hawks. She patted the fair hand that lay on the arm of the sofa, and said:</p>
               <p>"We shall get on together capitally—I know we shall, so begin to make yourself at home, my dear, and always try to look as bright as you do now. Where is your trunk? Mine are all packed and ready for a start to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"And so is hers," shouted Kitty. "It will be here before long. Miss Gordon has been spending a few days with me, and I will see that her luggage is sent here in time."</p>
               <p>"Oh—ah! so she went to you first. That wasn't necessary, but I suppose she was shy about coming alone to the house of a perfect stranger. She seems a young thing to be left to take care of herself, but she has secured a good home now, and if she only proves quick about learning cribbage and piquet we shall get along together admirably."</p>
               <p>"I know you will, and you must be very kind to her for my sake. I must go now, but you will soon see me at Newport, as ma and I go next week."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks shook hands with her in a very friendly manner, and Nina went with her to the door. Kitty pettishly said:</p>
               <p>"You will find it precious dull sitting up day after day playing games with that old fright, but it won't last long, that's one comfort. Do the best you can, and be sure that I shall stand your fast friend."</p>
               <p>"I know that, dear, and it gives me courage to go through with what is unavoidable. I am very grateful to you, Kitty, and I think I shall find my place with Mrs. Hawks a very tolerable one. I am too mercurial to care much about games, but I can learn them very quickly, and I shall<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6338-00000042"/> not care if she insists on being the winner the greater part of the time. 'Beggars must not be choosers,' you know, and I really think that I have been very fortunate in securing such a place. I had far rather play at cards or rattle dice all day than to listen to the noise of the piano played on by unskilful fingers. Good-bye, dear. In another week I hope we will be re-united."</p>
               <p>"Yes—that consoles me for our present separation. I shall not permit any delay that can be helped, and I shall write to Dolly to-night, and tell him what a queer patroness you have found. You must note her well, that you may give him an idea of her peculiarities in your own droll way. I anticipate many a good laugh at the old lady's expense."</p>
               <p>"Hush-h," said Nina, warningly. "Pray don't breathe a syllable of that nonsense, for it might ruin me with Mrs. Hawks. You forget that I am Miss Prim now, and bound to attend to all the proprieties."</p>
               <p>A little bitter laugh followed, which made guileless Kitty pity her more than ever. She kissed her affectionately and after uttering a few more hopeful words, ran lightly down the steps, and was gone.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">NINA RESOLVES ON A COURSE OF ACTION.</head>
               <p>WITH a feeling almost of rage at the distasteful position in which she found herself placed, Nina lingered a few moments before the door to recover her serenity of aspect before returning to the apartment in which Mrs. Hawks was impatiently awaiting her reappearance.</p>
               <p>When she at last went in she found she same woman who had admitted her, standing near the sofa talking by signs to her mistress.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins was an intelligent, grave-looking woman, with an expression of earnest attention to what was passing around her, which led Nina at once to the conclusion that her acting must be very perfect, or those shrewd eyes would see through her, and probably use such influence as she possessed against her.</p>
               <p>"I may find it necessary to conciliate her," she thought. "But why should I undertake it, for I shall not long remain as an humble satellite to this stupid old woman. Only let me once find a field of action, and I will win the position and fortune Fate has denied me."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks motioned to her to come and sit beside her on the sofa. In her harsh, unmodulated voice she said:</p>
               <p>"Perkins thinks you are too pretty, Miss Gordon. She says that I will find a young creature like you a troublesome charge, especially at such a place as Newport. I hope you'll not attempt to fly around among the people there, for I shan't approve of anything like that. I am very particular in my notions about young girls, and I shall keep you near me all the time that is not spent in sleeping."</p>
               <p>With the sweetest silvery laugh Nina glanced archly at the demure face of the woman and said:</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Perkins will soon find out that she has misjudged me. I intend to devote myself to you, dear madam, and I know that I shall soon find pleasure in making myself useful to you. I know very little of the world, and care less for it than most girls of my age; and I am sure that I shall be able to content myself with contributing to your happiness."</p>
               <p>The clear bell-like voice in which she spoke made itself audible to the dulled ears beside her, and Mrs. Hawks delightedly exclaimed:</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6338-00000043"/>
               <p>"I declare I can understand every word you say. Other people scream at me and confuse me, but you have at once found the right pitch for your voice. You will prove a treasure to me, I know, so Perkins may as well hold her tongue."</p>
               <p>"'New brooms sweep clean,'" muttered Mrs. Perkins, "but you'll see in the long run who cares for you most. This is your day, Miss Gordon, but if you hold out any better than the rest, I am mistaken. She always begins by spoiling the companion that comes to her, and when they get to putting on airs she just ships 'em off, almost without warning."</p>
               <p>To this Nina replied in her sweetest manner:</p>
               <p>"Thank you for the warning, Mrs. Perkins. I shall be careful to be on my guard and not put on airs. Let me say that I do not despair of even gaining your approval."</p>
               <p>The woman's face cleared a little, for few could resist the charm of Nina's smile, or the graceful sweetness of her manner when she wished to please. She more graciously said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Miss, we shall see. You're a deal younger and prettier than the others we have tried, and I hardly think the place will suit you. You can but try, though you've no idea of what is before you; but there's time enough for you to find it out, without my telling you."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks became impatient at not understanding what was said, and she irritably broke in:</p>
               <p>"What's that you are talking about, Perkins? Are you telling Miss Gordon that I am hard to please and can't keep a companion? It's their fault, you know, for <emph>you</emph> have been with me a dozen years, and still mean to stay as long as I choose to keep you."</p>
               <p>"Yes—I intend to stay with you as long as you live," replied the woman, raising her voice, "because I promised my old master that I would never leave you."</p>
               <p>A strange, shrill cry issued from the lips of Mrs. Hawks, and she fell back on the sofa struggling convulsively.</p>
               <p>Nina started up in alarm, crying out:</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with her? Why is she so fright-fully excited?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins bathed the face of her mistress in cold water, as she calmly replied:</p>
               <p>"This will be your hardest trial, Miss Gordon, for she is subject to these attacks, and you must learn what to do for her when they come on. It's a kind of epilepsy, and the doctor says she'll die in one of 'em, some of these days."</p>
               <p>Nina had that lively horror of physical suffering which is felt by most persons of her temperament, and she shrank as far as possible from the writhing form beside her.</p>
               <p>The faint, gurgling sounds, mingled with moans that issued from the drawn lips of Mrs. Hawks, filled her with shuddering dread. Her artificial teeth fell out, and the poor old creature lay before her a spectacle of pity and repulsion.</p>
               <p>When Nina recovered her scattered senses her first impulse was to seize on the yelping poodle, give him a violent shake, and shut him out of the room. She then assisted Mrs. Perkins to place her mistress in a more comfortable position, and helped to chafe her hands till the blood began to circulate again and the purple flush to leave her face. She fell into a deep sleep, and her loud breathing was a new terror to the inexperienced nurse. She tremulously inquired of the waiting woman if her mistress was often in this condition.</p>
               <p>"Oftener than you'll find agreeable," was the curt reply. "But her fits is irregular. Sometimes she'll go two or three weeks without having one, and then maybe she'll be took with as many as four in one day."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens! If I had only known this before. Was Mrs. Bates aware of these attacks?"</p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6338-00000044"/>
               <p>"No, Miss, she wasn't, for Mrs. Hawks don't want any one to know about 'em. Mrs. Bates don't trouble herself coming here much, though her husband has the management of some of Mrs. Hawks' money. That is how his wife came to know that a companion was wanted. The young lady came to see about it several times, but her mother only called once a few minutes, and that was to settle that you was to come. You begin to see now that you have undertaken a job you will hardly be able to go through with."</p>
               <p>Something in the woman's tone nettled Nina, and she drily replied:</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly stay, Mrs. Perkins. What others can endure, I can."</p>
               <p>"Well—you can try it, and it isn't for me to discourage you, for I have a better time myself when there's somebody around to play them games with her that she's so fond of. But I'll tell you now that you're not to try and get 'round her and cut Miss Inez out. I won't have that, for I nursed her, and I mean to stay by her aunt till her will is made and my poor young lady provided for as she has a right to be."</p>
               <p>"Who is Miss Inez? And why are you afraid that I shall attempt to interfere with her?"</p>
               <p>"She is the sweetest young lady living; and she's the daughter of Mrs. Hawks' only sister. She lives near Newport in a stuffy old house that aint fit for her to stay in nohow, but her father's lost all his fortune, and he's paralyzed. One comfort is, he can't last much longer, and then Miss Inez will come to live with her aunt. All the money ought to go to her, for it came from her grandfather, and her own mother was cut off with a shilling because she married a forriner that the old gentleman didn't like. Now that poor old creature yonder is always threatening to leave her money away from her because Miss Inez won't leave her father and come to live with her, and she seems to have taken such a shine to you, that I don't know what such an old silly might not do. But <emph>I</emph> won't have it, I tell you, Miss Gordon, and if you mean to stay with Mrs. Hawks you must not set yourself up against me."</p>
               <p>Though offended at the tone assumed by the woman, Nina felt that she was too much of a stranger in the house to afford to make her an eneny. The possibilities this injudicious confidence opened before her were enticing, for she remembered what Kitty had written to her on the subject of Mrs. Hawks' wealth, and the use she might make of the influence she could gain; so she quietly said:</p>
               <p>"You need not distrust me, Mrs. Perkins, for I have only sought a temporary shelter with Mrs. Hawks, and I shall probably find a home more suited to my tastes before I leave Newport. As to Miss Inez, I will gladly serve her with her aunt, if an opportunity to do so arises."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins earnestly regarded her, and she slowly said:</p>
               <p>"Light-haired people always get the better of dark ones; and your eyes, soft as you can make 'em look, aint the true sort. I have seen eyes like 'em once afore in my life, and the man that owned 'em was false enough."</p>
               <p>"Eyes like mine! To whom did they belong, for I have always been told that mine are very peculiar."</p>
               <p>"So they is, with them yaller spots a-shinin' on 'em; I never saw any like 'em but once afore, and that was when I was a young woman. The man that owned 'em was mighty takin' in his ways, as a young gal I knew found out to her cost. But that's an old story, and I am not going to tell you, nor nobody else about it."</p>
               <p>Nina's curiosity was aroused, and she would have given much to hear it; but as she was unwilling to betray her<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6338-00000045"/> uncertainty as to who or what she was herself, she was forced to acquiesce in the decision of her talkative companion. She pleasantly said:</p>
               <p>"I hope that you will not be so unjust to me, Mrs. Perkins, as to take up a prejudice against me because I happen to resemble the false Lothario you refer to. Let us be friends, while we are in the same service; for I have no one on whom I have a natural claim for kindness."</p>
               <p>The woman shook her head dubiously.</p>
               <p>"He was false enough, but his name wasn't Lothario. As to you, I will try to judge you by the old rule of 'pretty is as pretty does.' If you are straightforward, and don't take to any underhand ways to get the better of that poor old half-dazed woman yonder, we'll get along well enough together."</p>
               <p>Nina laughed; the softest of musical ripples gurgled from her rosy lips; and with naïve simplicity she replied:</p>
               <p>"You put strange thoughts in my head, Mrs. Perkins, and suggest a course of conduct that is impossible to a well brought up girl. You need have no fears on my account, for I promise to cherish no designs against the interests of the young lady you spoke of just now. What is her other name? You can tell me that, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Of course I can, for there's no mystery about <emph>her,</emph> as you'll soon see for yourself. Miss Inez Lopez aint ashamed of her name, I guess, if her father was a furrin man."</p>
               <p>"Lopez—he must have been a Spaniard."</p>
               <p>"Yes—he came from Cuby, where he owned great estates. But the money's all gone, and an old tumble-down house in the country is all he's got left. Mrs. Hawks allows him a 'nuity to live on since he lost the use of his limbs."</p>
               <p>"But why did Mr. Lopez leave his native island?"</p>
               <p>"Because he'd lost all his fortune, and he wouldn't live poor among those who had known him as a rich man. He's as proud as Lucifer, and as cross—as cross as two sticks. He thought the air of Newport agreed with him, and he came there to live in a house he bought in his grand days for a summer home. His wife died there the first year they ever came to it, and after that the place was shut up for many a long year. Then the ruin came, and he had no other place to go to, so he made the best of the old house; but it's a poor place for my young lady to live in."</p>
               <p>"Of course Miss Lopez is pretty. Nearly all Spanish girls are."</p>
               <p>"Pretty,—no, that ain't the word for her. You're pretty, but she is grand. She looks like a young queen, with her stately figure and the prond way she carries her head. But she's true and gentle a young creature as ever was born."</p>
               <p>"But how did you come to leave her if you love her so dearly? You said that you had nursed her."</p>
               <p>"I didn't leave her of my own accord. When her ma died, Mr. Lopez went back to Cuby, and he sent me back to my old home in Rhode Island, though I begged to go with 'em. He never liked me, and he wouldn't have me about Miss Inez any longer. I got married soon afterward, and in a few years my husband died, leaving me very little to live on. About that time Mrs. Hawks fell into bad health, and lost her hearing. She had known me from girlhood, and, as she wanted somebody about her she could depend on, she sent for me to come and live with her. I've been with her ever since, and it was through me that she made up with Mr. Lopez again, for she was as angry about the match Miss Susie made as her father was. Every summer she goes to Newport to be near her niece as much as for the sea-bathing. But I don't see why I am telling you all this, Miss Gordon, and you so much of a stranger to me, too."</p>
               <p>Nina replied, with a smile:</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6338-00000046"/>
               <p>"You see that I have won upon your confidence already, Mrs. Perkins, in spite of your first impulse of dislike. In your heart you feel that I am to be trusted, or you would not so soon have given me these family details."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that. I'm a foolish old body to talk; and when any one listens with interest, I could speak about Miss Inez forever; and I could fight like a tiger if her interests were at stake."</p>
               <p>"You will not have to do battle with me, Mrs. Perkins. But just listen to that dog; he has been yelping through all we have said."</p>
               <p>"I'll soon settle him, the little beast! He gives me nearly as much trouble as his mistress."</p>
               <p>She opened the door of the room, seized on the poodle, and giving him a violent shaking, put him down on an ottoman and ordered him to remain quiet. After a few faint yelps, Bijou thought it best to obey, and Mrs. Perkins turned her attention to her mistress. She said:</p>
               <p>"You can sit here and fan her while I go out and see that her supper is ready by the time she wakes. She is always hungry when she comes out of one of these spells, and I take care to have something nice for her. It is the surest way of keeping her in a good humor, and you'll soon find out how important that is to the comfort of every one around her."</p>
               <p>Nina sat down beside the sofa, and took up a large feather fan, while Mrs. Perkins went out to attend to her domestic duties.</p>
               <p>Left alone, the young adventuress reviewed all that had lately passed between them, and weighed her own chances of success in the path she had been warned not to venture on.</p>
               <p>Gradually her face cleared; a smile of triumphant meaning curled her ruby lips, and she muttered:</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Perkins, for pointing out to me the road to fortune in so verdant a manner. I <emph>will</emph> try to be the winner in the game we shall play against each other, and I believe that I have a fair chance of success."</p>

               <head type="sub">MRS. HAWKES MAKES A REVELATION.</head>
               <p>TWILIGHT deepened; the roar of the great eddies of human life that fret and clash against each other through the weary day, grew fainter and fainter. Night came down, and the silent stars gleamed out in the patch of blue sky Nina could see over the tops of the opposite houses.</p>
               <p>Still there was no movement in the house which indicated that others were stirring. The sleeping woman still filled the room with the sound of her heavy breathing, and the dog remained quiet after the discipline he had gone through.</p>
               <p>Nina began to feel hungry, and she wondered how long it would be before this dreary vigil would be interrupted. She pictured to herself the lighted parlors and the gay company assembled in Kitty's home, and rebelled anew against the fate which chained her in this lonely house, severed from the social enjoyments for which her soul panted.</p>
               <p>She heard a neighboring clock strike the hours, and just as nine rang out, there was a movement on the sofa, and the voice of Mrs. Hawks called out, in an alarmed tone:</p>
               <p>"Where am I? What has happened? Perkins, what do you mean by leaving me in the dark? Oh! I shall die if I find that I have been left alone."</p>
               <p>"You are not alone, ma'am," said Nina, rising and<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6338-00000047"/> standing beside her. "I remained here to watch beside you. Can I do anything for you?"</p>
               <p>She spoke so clearly and precisely that Mrs. Hawks understood her, and, suddenly recalling all that had passed before her seizure, she replied:</p>
               <p>"Oh! you are my new companion. Well, child, haven't you any common sense that you sat here in the dark when there are matches on the table yonder and gas-burners to be lighted. I'm not fond of darkness, and I don't know when such a thing has happened to me before. If your voice didn't please me so much, I should be very angry with you; but I can hear what you say, and that is such an uncommon thing with me that I can excuse your negligence for once."</p>
               <p>"I feared that the light might annoy you, especially as Mrs. Perkins said nothing about lighting the gas. But I will hasten to do so now, madam."</p>
               <p>Luckily for herself, Nina had noticed the position of the match box, and she now deftly performed the service required of her; a brilliant stream of light fell upon the haggard face of the invalid, from which the purple flush had faded, leaving it sallow and wan to the last degree. She missed her false teeth, and signed for them to be brought to her. Mrs. Perkins had placed them in a tumbler of water on the table, and Nina hastened to present them to their owner. After several efforts, Mrs. Hawks succeeded in placing them properly in her mouth; and then, sitting up, she called her poodle to her side, and sharply said:</p>
               <p>"Of course I am ready for my supper now. There is the bell-handle—ring such a peal on it as will bring Perkins here at once!"</p>
               <p>With tranquil grace the young girl moved to obey her, looking as calm as if she had not remarked the irritated tone of the speaker, but the energetic pull she gave the bell-cord might have betrayed that all was not so peaceful within as her outward bearing seemed to indicate.</p>
               <p>In a few moments Mrs. Perkins appeared, and anticipated the outburst she expected from the mistress, by quickly saying;</p>
               <p>"The supper is served, ma'am, and the cook has broiled some most delicious birds for you. The last tea is as fragrant as violets, and the muffins from the baker's have been warmed, and are swimming in fresh butter. I've got the things for you that I know you like best."</p>
               <p>This tempting list of delicacies stayed the words of reproof that trembled on Mrs. Hawks' lips, and she curtly said:</p>
               <p>"I'll go to supper at once then. I expect that Miss Gordon thinks we intend to starve her, but she'll soon find out that my table is good, if nothing else here is to her taste."</p>
               <p>"Dear madam," said Nina, deprecatingly, "I shall make myself contented and at home with you, as you so kindly desired me. A friendless, homeless orphan like myself will be only too happy to find a refuge in which I can make myself useful."</p>
               <p>She hastened to assist Mrs. Hawks to rise, offered her arm as a support, and they went into the dining-room, which was on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins, after a sharp, distrustful glance at the two, followed them into the brilliantly-lighted room, in which a small table, elegantly set out, was placed. Besides the edibles already enumerated, Nina found several others which she would scarcely approve as suitable to be partaken of by an invalid at that hour of the night.</p>
               <p>But Mrs. Hawks evidently thought differently, for she helped herself from every dish in turn, and did ample justice to each one.</p>
               <p>Nina made the tea, and Mrs. Perkins waited behind the<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6338-00000048"/> chair of her mistress, carefully supplying all her wants and as carefully watching the new inmate of the house. Nina endured her scrutiny with perfect coolness, and the woman began to believe her as guileless and innocent as she wished to appear.</p>
               <p>When the supper was at last over, they returned to the parlor, and as the bronze clock on the mantel pointed to ten, Nina hoped that the first stage of her probation was over and she would be permitted to retire to her own apartment. What then was her chagrin when Mrs. Perkins wheeled a small table to the side of the sofa, placed pillows at the back of its occupant, and placing a pack of cards in the hands of the companion, said:</p>
               <p>"I have done <emph>my</emph> part now till she's ready to go to bed, and you must amuse her till then."</p>
               <p>"But when is bed-time?" asked Nina. "In a quiet house like this I should think it had come now."</p>
               <p>"Because you don't know anything about our habits. Wait, and see for yourself. When the mistress gets sleepy, it's your bed-time and mine; and as she's took a pretty long nap, I don't think it will come very early to-night. Don't show her that you are sleepy, unless you want to offend. This don't often happen, though, and by ten o'clock, most nights, you'll be free to do as you please."</p>
               <p>With a suppressed yawn, Nina moved toward the table, and placed herself opposite the grim figure that awaited her.</p>
               <p>"I feel quite refreshed and strengthened by my siesta and my supper, and we'll take a turn at the pictures, as my poor dear father used to call them. He taught me to love games, and I wonder sometimes if he isn't playing them in the other world. The spiritualists say that such things are done in the spheres, you know."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know," said Nina, absently. "I am afraid that I shall be a sad bore to you at first, Mrs. Hawks. I only know the cards by name, and something of their value."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! my dear, any one as quick as you are can learn anything you set your mind on. We'll start with piquet, because I like that best; and if you have any head for calculation, you can soon master it. Throw out the cards for me, for I always take the first deal."</p>
               <p>After a few preliminary instructions which the neophyte was quick to understand, the game commenced, and continued with varying fortune till two more hours passed away.</p>
               <p>Nina bit her lips to suppress the strong desire to yawn in the face of her opponent, which at moments almost overcame her endurance; but at last Mrs. Hawks threw herself back and said:</p>
               <p>"That will do for to-night, Miss Gordon. You are really the cleverest young woman I ever met with, and I only wish that my own niece was half as agreeable to me. You don't know anything of Inez, I suppose; she is my sister's daughter, and her mother has been dead many years. I should like to be fond of her but she is opinionated, and she sets up her will against mine. Even when that stupid old father of hers dies I hardly think she will come to me on my own terms. Perkins is always tormenting me about making my will in her favor, but I shan't do it till I see what that obstinate young body is willing to do for my gratification. Do you know, child, that I am very rich? I could spend twenty thousand a year, if I chose, and not touch the principal of my fortune. It's all mine, to do as I please with; and, if you go on as you've begun, it is not impossible that you may cut out the proud girl my disinherited sister left behind her. If the money did all come from my father, that is no reason why I should give it to Inez, unless she tries to win my favor. Don't you think I am right now?"</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6338-00000049"/>
               <p>"Of course you are, madam. But with so much at your command, you could provide handsomely for your niece and be generous to others besides. As to myself, I aspire to nothing more than to earn the liberal salary you have offered me and prove to you how grateful I am for liking me as well as you say you do."</p>
               <p>"Like you!—I think I do, child; and I am sure that I shall soon find you indispensable to me. That Miss Briggs that went away to-day was a sore trial to my patience, though at first she did pretty well. She set herself up after a few days as my conscience-keeper, but I soon showed her that I meant to think and act for myself. I would not tolerate a judge in my own house who was less merciful than the good Creator himself would be to a poor old sinner like me, and I told her as much. I don't pretend to be good, but I try to do nothing that is very bad."</p>
               <p>"I quite agree with you, ma'am," replied Nina, with a smile.</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Hawks went on:</p>
               <p>"You are a sensible girl, I see, and I am interested in you. Come, sit here close beside me, and tell me about yourself. I want to know something more about this uncle of yours. I hardly think he has dealt fairly by you in throwing you on the world at your age."</p>
               <p>Moved by a sudden impulse to be frank with her new friend, Nina drew near her; and, with clear and precise utterance, told her all she knew of herself, and of the mystery in which her uncle had chosen to surround himself.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks listened with keen interest, and at the close of her narrative said:</p>
               <p>"You are either a great heiress and your uncle is keeping you out of your inheritance, or you——"</p>
               <p>She paused suddenly, fixed her wild-looking eyes searchingly upon Nina's face, and went on:</p>
               <p>"I won't say what I was going to add, for it might hurt you, and I have no right to speak what came into my mind unless I was sure of its truth."</p>
               <p>"You may utter it, Mrs. Hawks, and I shall not care. I have thought over this strange secrecy on the part of my uncle, until it has, at times, almost unhinged my mind. I only wish that you could suggest some plausible explanation of his conduct."</p>
               <p>"My surmise would not please you, my dear, so I will not give you the benefit of it," she dryly replied. "We will talk of something else now, if you please. Do you know why I feel drawn toward you so strangely? No, how should you; so I will explain. It is because you look so much like that Anna Moore I spoke of to-night. Your voice and your ways are like hers too, and I once loved her very dearly."</p>
               <p>"Tell me about her, if you please," said Nina, caressingly. "I am so happy to resemble her if it makes me more acceptable to you, dear madam."</p>
               <p>"There isn't much to tell. Anna was the daughter of my father's housekeeper, and she was partly educated with my sister and myself. We had a private teacher, for we lived in the country, and my father was not willing to send us to boarding-school. Anna was pretty and ambitious. My sister and I took a fancy to her, and made her a sort of companion, though she had at first been our waiting-maid. She shared our lessons; even music and dancing were taught her, and she excelled both Susie and myself in both; but we liked her too sincerely to be jealous of her superiority."</p>
               <p>"That was truly generous," put in Nina, when the talkative old lady paused to take breath.</p>
               <p>"But the time came when Anna set herself up as a rival to Susie, and trouble to her grew out of it. We travelled<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6338-00000050"/> the first summer after our studies were ended, and entered the fashionable world as young ladies. At Saratoga we met with a young lawyer from Philadelphia who admired my sister so much that when we returned home in the autumn he followed her to Oakland.</p>
               <p>"Anna Moore had not accompanied us in our tour, as she would not consent to go with us as our personal attendant, so she was left behind, and a French waiting-maid was employed after we reached New York. It was a much better arrangement for Susie and me, for our new attendant understood what we needed a great deal better than an inexperienced country girl would.</p>
               <p>"But when we returned home, Anna was again our companion and friend. She sat with us in the evening when strangers were not present, and when friends stayed in the house, she was always treated by them as if she formed part of the family. The young man I spoke of was a gay, and dashing fellow—fond of ladies' society, and most agreeable to them. Susie liked him very well, but he was not rich, and she fancied that he sought her for her fortune, more than through any feeling of preference he had for herself. It soon turned out that she was right, for when he made the acquaintance of Anna Moore his true heart was touched for the first time.</p>
               <p>"He must have fallen desperately in love with her, for it was soon evident that she alone detained him at Oakland. The certainty of this came on Susie with a kind of shock, for she had never dreamed of finding a rival in our humble companion, but it did not touch her very deeply. She had only admired Mr. Hastings, and——"</p>
               <p>An exclamation escaped Nina, and Mrs. Hawks stopped abruptly. Her companion hastened to say:</p>
               <p>"Pray go on, ma'am. I was only struck by the name. I have heard of a Mr. Hastings before, but it is not likely that he and the gentleman of whom you were speaking, are the same."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps they are; who knows? But I will finish what I had to say, and we can compare notes afterwards. As I said, Anna was ambitious; but I don't believe that she thought of the superior position of the man at all, for she was fascinated, enthralled by him to that degree that she was ready to throw herself in the dust at his feet; to work for him; to beg for him, if that had been necessary; to become his slave through all the years of her life. She confessed as much to me in a moment of extreme excitement, but at the same time, declared that she would never come between my sister and the man who had led her to believe he wished to marry her.</p>
               <p>"When I repeated this to Susie, she said with defiant pride:</p>
               <p>"That no harm would be done to her, if Anna won Hastings away from her, for she had never trusted him enough to love him, and knowing what she then knew, nothing would induce her to accept him.</p>
               <p>"Susie sought out her inconstant lover at once, and after telling him what she had discovered, asked him if he meant to offer his hand to the girl he evidently preferred before all others.</p>
               <p>"He paltered with her; refused to give a straight-forward answer, and said that it would ruin his prospects forever to marry a girl destitute of fortune. He confessed that no other woman had ever touched his heart so deeply, but love her as he might, he could not ask her to share his poverty with him.</p>
               <p>"That night he left Oakland, but I am sure that he saw Anna in the shrubbery before he went away; she was very unhappy after he was gone, but seemed braced up by some hope that, at intervals, brought back some of her old cheerfulness.</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6338-00000051"/>
               <p>"Two months passed by, and then it was discovered that Anna had disappeared from the house in the night, leaving behind her a note to me, in which she said that we must not think harshly of the course she had taken, for it was the only one to secure her happiness. She said she had gone to one who loved her, and she would be quite safe with him.</p>
               <p>"She entreated that no inquiries should be made after her, lest the fortune of her lover should be marred by a premature disclosure of their marriage, and with a fervent prayer for the happiness of Susie and myself, the unsatisfactory epistle ended.</p>
               <p>"Of course she had gone to join Mr. Hastings; there could be no doubt about that, but no one had any right to stir in the matter, for her mother had been dead several years, and as far as I know, Anna had no relations.</p>
               <p>"A year passed away, and we heard nothing from her; then we had a grief that touched us more nearly; that is, my father, and I, for Susie eloped with a young Spaniard my father particularly disliked, and our home seemed almost broken up by the desertion of its two brightest spirits. My father's health failed him, and we travelled for several years almost constantly. When we at length came back to Oakland, we found Anna Moore living in the family of my uncle, taking care of his two motherless children.</p>
               <p>"But such a changed creature you never saw. All the bloom, and the brightness of her youth was gone. She was sad—almost morose at times, and when I spoke of the years of our separation, and asked for some account of herself, she abruptly refused to give any.</p>
               <p>"'It was enough,' she said, 'that her dream of wedded happiness had faded into nothingness. She had found falsehood where she expected only the loftiest sense of truth and honor, and henceforth she could have faith in no man. She had proved to my uncle that she was worthy to fill the place in his family which he had given her, and beyond that, no one had a right to inquire. The nearest and dearest of friends should never wring from her the history of her humiliation and abandonment.'</p>
               <p>"I questioned her no more, for I plainly saw that it would be useless. She had resumed her own name, and refused to allow that of Hastings to pass her lips, so she was left to bear her burden as she would.</p>
               <p>"A few months after our return to our old home, my uncle removed to Richmond, in Virginia, taking Anna with his family, and after the lapse of a few years, we heard that she had married a merchant of Norfolk; a man much older than herself, and very strict in his religious notions. I have reason to believe that she never told him of that wretched episode in her early history, but she has tried to atone for her early indiscretion by becoming almost as strait-laced in her belief, as they say the husband is.</p>
               <p>"I have never met with her since her marriage, but at intervals, she has written to me. She duly informed me of the birth of her children, of whom she has six, and she lectures me on the sinfulness of my ways just as coolly as if she had always been herself a piece of immaculate perfection. I don't believe in people that are always preaching, my dear. It's an impertinent habit indulged in by low-bred creatures, who are pharisaical enough to think themselves better than all the rest of the world. It's the clergyman's business to do the lecturing, and one can stand it from him, but not from those who are often no better than the one on whose head they pour out all the vials of divine wrath; as if such dangerous things would be entrusted to <emph>their</emph> keeping."</p>
               <p>Nina scarcely listened to the last words of the speaker.<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6338-00000052"/> She was impatiently awaiting a pause to ask the name of the gentleman Miss Moore had married. The opportunity at length came, and in reply, Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"His name? Well, I may as well tell you that, as I've told you the rest of the story. It isn't likely that you will ever be anywhere near poor Anna, so your knowing it can do no harm. She married Mr. Thomas Marsden, who keeps a large wholesale grocery in Norfolk, and I have heard that he is getting rich. For the sake of his wife, I hope it is true."</p>
               <p>Nina had listened to this story with a degree of absorbing interest for which she would have found it impossible to account. She now asked:</p>
               <p>"Was nothing more ever heard of Mr. Hastings?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes—I know a great deal about him; but his story, as blended with that of Anna, is still a mystery. He removed to Mississippi and settled in Natchez, where he practised law till his marriage with a wealthy woman. He then gave up his profession, and removed to her plantation, where he has lived ever since."</p>
               <p>"And has he a daughter called Opal?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—but how did you know that?"</p>
               <p>"I have heard a young student I knew in New Haven, speak of Mr. Hastings' daughter. She was his betrothed."</p>
               <p>"Who was he, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Godfrey Fenton," replied Nina, as steadily as if the man she named had not still the power to set her pulses throbbing and her heart to aching when she recalled that bitter past.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that this can be true?" exclaimed Mrs. Hawks, "If so, it is good news to me, but what a traitor the man must be? Are you <emph>sure</emph> that he is actually betrothed to Miss Hastings?"</p>
               <p>"I had the information from his own lips, ma'am."</p>
               <p>"The wretch!" was the indignant response made by Mrs. Hawks. "That very young man has been making violent love to my niece for months past, and he has been three times to Newport especially to visit her. To see them together, one would believe them perfectly infatuated with each other, and I can hardly doubt that the man is really in love with her. He means to jilt Miss Hastings, if I will make Inez rich. That is very evident to me now, and if I refuse to settle something handsome on her, he will go back to the other girl. I've always had my suspicions of Mr. Godfrey Fenton, and now they are fully justified. Don't you think so, Miss Gordon?"</p>
               <p>Here was the opportunity so ardently thirsted for to deal a first blow at Fenton, and after a moment's hesitation, Nina distinctly said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fenton told me himself that he could not marry a woman destitute of fortune. He may be attracted for a season by Miss Lopez, but he has no constancy in him. He has flirted with others as recklessly as he seems to be trifling with her, and a more false or dangerous man it would be difficult to find."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks looked at her with some surprise, and she abruptly asked:</p>
               <p>"Why should you speak so positively on this subject? Have <emph>you</emph> had any love passages with Godfrey Fenton?"</p>
               <p>Nina's face flushed crimson, and then grew pale as marble. After a pause of deep emotion, she gained composure to reply:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fenton made love to me as he does to every girl who is unfortunate enough to attract his attention; but nothing serious grew out of it. We are no longer friends, and I am sorry to hear that we are likely to be thrown together again."</p>
               <p>"Oh! as to that, you need have no fears. After what<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6338-00000053"/> you have just told me I will not receive him if he calls, and my poor silly Inez will surely give him up when she learns that he is not free to woo her. I never liked him from the first, though he tried to make himself agreeable to me when I met him at the Glades. I saw him the last time I was there, and it came out that while his mother thought he was travelling for his improvement, he was wasting time in making love where it seems he had no right to make it. Inez shall hear the truth about Mr. Fenton as surely as I see her again."</p>
               <p>"Is he at this time in Newport?" faltered Nina.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. He flies away—stays five or six weeks, and goes back again. But if he isn't there now, he will be sure to come before we get away. I am very glad that I have heard this, for I shall put an end to the whole affair by flatly refusing to give my niece a dime if she marries him. If fortune is his object, he will be sure to back out when he finds that she is to have nothing as his wife."</p>
               <p>"When Mr. Fenton fully understands that, I think you will have no further trouble about him," said Nina, significantly.</p>
               <p>The clock rang out its silvery peal, and Mrs. Hawks looked at her watch, and said:</p>
               <p>"It is midnight, I declare, and you have to play me to sleep, for I always have music at night when I retire. Mrs. Bates told me that you can sing charmingly, and I am anxious to hear you. Ring the bell for Perkins, and come with me to my room. Your's is near it, and my maid sleeps in the one opening from mine, as I always need some one near me at night."</p>
               <p>Nina was now more widely awake than in the earlier part of the night, and the new duty required of her gave her little annoyance. Mrs. Perkins promptly answered the bell, though she had evidently been asleep.</p>
               <p>With her assistance, Mrs. Hawks ascended the stairs, followed closely by Nina. A large apartment over the parlor luxuriously furnished, with a smaller one opening from it, were appropriated to mistress and maid, and Nina found that her own room was across the hall, an arrangement she particularly liked, as she wished at least to sleep quietly when she was permitted to retire.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Hawks was finally settled comfortably in bed, a small cabinet piano that stood near it was opened, and a quantity of German music placed upon it by the attendant. This, Nina understood she was expected to play till her strange employer fell asleep.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins explained:</p>
               <p>"You must begin by singing a few plaintive songs. She likes soft and soothing music, though she can't hear much more than the murmur of any sort. In half an hour she'll be sound enough, and you can go to your room. Turn the gas down but leave it burning, for she can't bear darkness."</p>
               <p>"But if she should be seized with one of those frightful spasms in the night, what should we do?"</p>
               <p>"Just as I have done for years—bring her out of it the best way I could."</p>
               <p>"But how would you know about it?"</p>
               <p>"Easily enough. The bell-cord has been lengthened, and Mrs. Hawks goes to sleep with it fastened to her wrist. The first movement she makes in one of them spasms rings it right over my head, and I go in to her. You needn't be afraid of one to-night; she don't often have two violent attacks in twenty-four hours. It's when they are light that they come often. I have given her some drops, and I think she'll sleep till ten in the morning."</p>
               <p>"I thought that we were to leave for Newport early in the day?"</p>
               <p>"She won't be well enough after her late spell, and we shall have to go by the evening boat."</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6338-00000054"/>
               <p>Having thus curtly spoken, Mrs. Perkins motioned toward the piano, and retired leaving the door of communication between the two rooms open.</p>
               <p>Nina sat down and commenced her task. She was herself fond of the wild German music, and played it with much expression. After singing two songs she struck into a plaintive theme, and continued on till a loud snore from Mrs. Hawks startled her with a sudden consciousness that her duties for the night were at last ended.</p>
               <p>She rose from her seat with a feeling of release, and quietly turning down the gas went into her own room to prepare for repose and to think over in her scheming mind all she had that night learned.</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton's ghost had suddenly risen before her, and she vainly asked herself what evil fate had thrown him across her path again. What dread power had so tangled the threads of their destinies, that they must continue to influence each other, and not for good. Could an answer in that hour have been given, she would have shrunk and cowered before the future that was sealed from her vision, but the dark curtain cannot be lifted at will from the days to come, and Nina listened only to the vindictive promptings of her own outraged heart, and determined to be the shadow on his way if it were permitted to her to become such.</p>
               <p>She reviewed the story of Anna Moore and made a memorandum in her private tablets of the name she now bore. After sitting a long time beside the open window, she retired to her couch, but her pillow was wet with tears, wrung from many bitter sources, before she found the oblivion of sleep.</p>
               <p>This creature, destined to become the incarnation of evil to more than one of those of whom she had that night heard, was not destitute of good impulses. Placed in a brilliant sphere of life, surrounded by the appliances she had been led to believe her birthright, the darker elements of her protean nature might have lain forever unstirred; but such was not to be her fate; and the evil genius, who it is said, waits on all of mortal mould while life lasts, was fast gaining the ascendancy in those hours of darkness in which she lay brooding over the bitter past.</p>
               <p>With Nina's fatal power to win affection and confidence, there was no limit to the wrongs she might inflict on those she professed to serve with all her strength.</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton resumed all his power over her heart, and she felt as if death were preferable to the knowledge of his union with another. She would use all her arts to prevent such a thing; she would win over Mrs. Hawks, and use her influence in such a way as would put an end to all hope of a marriage between Fenton and her niece; and thus resolving, she at length fell into a broken and uneasy slumber.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE NEVER DID RUN SMOOTH.</head>
               <p>AT a late hour of the morning Mrs. Hawks awoke in a very bad humor, and it tasked all the ingenuity of both Nina and Mrs. Perkins to amuse her impatience till the hour of departure arrived.</p>
               <p>They had besides many other things to attend to; for bills were to be settled, a responsible person to be left in charge of the house while its mistress was absent, and curtains and household linen to be packed away.</p>
               <p>Except with the first, the young companion had no concern, for she was not required to attend to any of the menial<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6338-00000055"/> duties which devolved on Mrs. Perkins. But Mrs. Hawks took a sudden fancy to have some trifling additions made to her wardrobe, and her carriage was ordered to take Miss Gordon to her milliner and mantua-maker to choose the articles, and give orders to have them forwarded to Newport as soon as they could be made up.</p>
               <p>Every moment of Nina's time was filled up, and when they at last took possession of the state rooms which had been secured for them on the Sound steamer, she felt perfectly worn out with the multiplicity of things she had been forced to attend to.</p>
               <p>The carriage went with them, and the driver, an intelligent Englishman, acted as a sort of courier for the party, looking after the luggage and settling with the porters.</p>
               <p>The wearied girl drew a long breath of relief when the first revolution of the wheels assured her that the boat was actually in motion, for only then was she sure that nothing further was to be attended to on shore.</p>
               <p>She found Mrs. Hawks to be one of those fussy travellers who are never certain that anything is perfectly right till it is past recalling, and up to the last moment she was perfectly sure that something had been left behind that was absolutely necessary to her comfort.</p>
               <p>Nina bore her exactions and irritation with an outward calmness of demeanor that was marvellous; but she had her own game to play, and she did not intend to be checkmated in its first moves, however difficult they might be in the making.</p>
               <p>The impatient invalid was at last settled in the narrow space allotted her, with her drops, her fan, and a bottle of cologne beside her; and Nina sat down, hoping for a brief interval of repose after her harassing day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"You are not to go out of my sight for a single moment, Miss Gordon, for I can't hear what is going on, and the boat might blow up, and I know nothing of it till I found myself flying up to the clouds a mass of scalded flesh. Ugh! It's dreadful to think of! And these steamboat people are so shockingly careless; one would think that human life is of no consequence to them."</p>
               <p>"I think this line of boats is very safe, ma'am. We rarely hear of any accident to them."</p>
               <p>"Safe? Stuff! No steamer is safe; and I always feel as if I had escaped from purgatory when I get safe off one. Is there no danger of a storm? Look out and see if there are any clouds. If there's one no bigger than my hand I shall be sure that others will follow it till they burst into a tornado."</p>
               <p>For the twentieth time Nina assured her that there were no indications of foul weather; but she resignedly replied:</p>
               <p>"Well, if we are all doomed to go to the bottom I suppose we will go in spite of all I can say. But if it should blow hard to-night I shall never forgive you for not telling me that it wasn't safe to come. There—don't talk to me; I can't hear what you say, and I feel as if I am shut up in a furnace. Take my fan and use it for my benefit, if you please."</p>
               <p>Nina wielded the fan a few moments, but by this time the boat had made some headway, and the evening breeze began to waft through the cabin. As Mrs. Hawks became more comfortable she recovered her equanimity, and more graciously said:</p>
               <p>"Sit down here close by me, child, and tell me what you saw that was amusing when you were out to-day. If I can't go among people myself I like to know what is going on in the outside world."</p>
               <p>Thus called on to play the agreeable, the sprightly invention of the young companion did not fail her, and she dressed<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6338-00000056"/> up her prosaic adventures of the day in so ludicrous a garb, that her grim Cerebus laughed more than once as if she really enjoyed it.</p>
               <p>Their supper was brought into them by Mrs. Perkins, who persuaded her mistress to take a glass of wine in which she had adroitly mingled some narcotic drops.</p>
               <p>In an aside to Nina she said:</p>
               <p>"She must take something to quiet her, or she'll keep us both up all night; and it might end in her having another spell. The doctor told me that the last drops would keep 'em off and make her sleep."</p>
               <p>"But if she should have a fit while under their influence, she might die in it."</p>
               <p>The woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>
               <p>"It can't be helped; she must take her chances. The doctors say there's no cure for her, and all we can do is to try and keep off the spasms as long as possible."</p>
               <p>"How long has she been afflicted in this way?"</p>
               <p>"She got a bad fall from being thrown from her carriage three years ago, and her spine was hurt in some way that can't be remedied; that's what caused 'em first. All I care for is to keep her alive till she's made her will in favor of Miss Inez, and you're to help me to persuade her to do that, you know?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; but Miss Lopez will be heir at law at any rate, so why should you be so anxious about the will?"</p>
               <p>"That's all you know about it," retorted the woman, contemptuously. "If a will aint made, her husband's relations will claim ever so much of the estate, and I know they are greedy enough about it from what I've seen myself. The money all come from Mrs. Hawks' father, for her husband had precious little when he married her. But that don't matter. The law gives a man the right to control his wife's fortune while he's living, and after she's dead, if there are no children, his relations can claim a good slice out of it, unless she leaves some paper behind her showing where it is to go. Law aint justice, nohow."</p>
               <p>"What's that you are talking about, Perkins?" asked Mrs. Hawks, in an irritated tone. "I won't have you gabbling away about what I don't understand. What are you telling Miss Gordon now?"</p>
               <p>"I was only telling her how to manage to-night," screamed Mrs. Perkins. "She's a young traveller, and needs instructions."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks glanced at Nina's face, and for the first time was struck with its wearied expression. She decisively said:</p>
               <p>"She needs something better than that. I have kept her running on errands all day, and the poor child is tired to death. I shall keep you with me to-night, Perkins, and let Miss Gordon have as good rest as she can get on this boat. We seem to be getting along pretty well, and I begin to hope that we shall be neither sent to the bottom nor blown up to the clouds. If we should, you will do as well to go up or down with as Miss Gordon."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins received this announcement with a slight frown; but she presently said to Nina, in an under tone:</p>
               <p>"You had better go while she is in the humor. You do look tired out, and I can do all that is necessary for her myself. I am more used to her whims, and I'll coax her to take another glass of the wine, so that she'll be sure of a good night's rest and let me sleep too."</p>
               <p>Nina gladly acted on this suggestion, and, bidding Mrs. Hawks good-night, she retired to the adjoining state-room and was soon sound asleep.</p>
               <p>In spite of Mrs. Hawks' dismal anticipations the voyage was prosperous, and the young girl awoke, bright and elastic<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6338-00000057"/> tic, to find herself at Newport. She hastened to make her toilette and go out of her room. Mrs. Hawks was still sleeping, and Nina ascended to the deck to take a look at the city around which so many interesting historical associations cluster.</p>
               <p>She gazed with vivid interest on the ancient-looking town, whose commerce was once greater than that of New York. Ranges of antique looking wooden houses overlooking mouldering old docks which once gave shelter to foreign fleets that laid the wealth of the tropics on those northern shores, were before her; but an air of decay pervaded all that portion of the town.</p>
               <p>Mingled among the store houses, some statelier mansions, now fallen into shabbiness, might be found, speaking eloquently of the departed glories of the place. Nina recalled the social history of the town with which her reading had made her familiar, and her fancy again pictured those old dwellings enlivened by the presence of the gallant and debonair French officers, who, in ante-revolutionary days, found the fair belles of the little American town quite as fascinating as the most aristocratic dames of the French Court.</p>
               <p>There too had dwelt that Berkely to whom Pope had attributed "every virtue under heaven," and who wrote so eloquently to prove the non-existence of matter.</p>
               <p>There too had been born, or had lived, some of the most distinguished men of the young nation. Poetry, oratory, and military renown have been alike illustrated in the annals of Newport, though it is now chiefly known as a fashionable summer resort.</p>
               <p>Nina was aroused from her dreams by a summons to attend Mrs. Hawks, whom she was glad to find up and dressed. Their late breakfast was then served by a special arrangement with the steward of the steamer; and after partaking of it, the old lady was got safely to her carriage which moved leisurely along the spacious square ascending to the old-fashioned State-House, thus affording its occupants time to view the handsome Jewish synagogue, and admire the simple wooden spire of Trinity church with antique architectural ornaments.</p>
               <p>The soft air fanned Nina's cheek, giving confimation to the opinion of Bishop Berkely, who says of Newport:</p>
               <p>"The climate is like that of Italy; the blandness of the air, so different from that of other sea-port towns in the same latitude, is accounted for by the sudden curving of the gulf stream, which brings its warm current of water almost to the shores of this fair island."</p>
               <p>Nina glanced back at the smooth waters of the bay, brightened by flitting sails, and then turned from the sleepy-looking old town to the new and bustling suburb which has grown up since the place became the summer resort of the idle and the fashionable.</p>
               <p>A spacious and elegant avenue invades the domain lying upon the ocean, and handsome houses look from the top of the hill toward the boundless expanse of blue water ever breaking into foam,—ever sending toward land that low monotone of music which has, for a sensitive ear, a sadness beyond all other sounds.</p>
               <p>A suite of apartments had been secured in the Ocean House for Mrs. Hawks, which comprised three rooms in the most retired portion of the large building. One looked toward the sea, and from it opened a large dressing closet which was appropriated to Mrs. Perkins. The sitting-room opened on a small veranda, and the apartment beyond it was assigned to Nina.</p>
               <p>Soon after their arrival, the driver with the carriage and horses was sent to the Glades, the residence of Mrs. Hawks' brother-in-law, to be taken care of there during her stay;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6338-00000058"/> for, rich as she was, she was not above saving a few dollars by such an arrangement.</p>
               <p>Dick took with him a note from Mrs. Hawks to Miss Lopez, desiring to see her at her lodgings as soon as possible, as she had something important to communicate to her.</p>
               <p>This summons was written by Nina in her character of amanuensis, and a bitter smile curled her lip as she wondered what the effect of the communication would be, and how she should find means to let Fenton know that hers had been the hand that dealt the blow about to fall.</p>
               <p>In her new sphere, Mrs. Hawks proved as exacting and difficult to please as before; but Nina's self-command never seemed to fail her. She had set herself the task to win the approbation of this self-indulgent and inconsiderate old woman for a purpose of her own, and she proved that she could endure much to attain the end in view.</p>
               <p>She began already to feel almost sure of success, for the old lady seemed more pleased with her with every passing hour, and Nina's fancy already revelled in dreams of a luxurious future gained without the alternative of accepting so uninteresting a specimen of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">genus homo</foreign> as Mr. Adolphus Bates.</p>
               <p>An excuse came from Miss Lopez, deferring her visit till the following day, as her father was not well enough to be left alone. Nina exerted herself to keep Mrs. Hawks in a good humor in spite of this disappointment, and Mrs. Perkins watched her with jealous eyes, for she began really to fear that she had placed a rival to her young lady too near the throne to be quite safe.</p>
               <p>But Nina soon found means to remove her misgivings, and induced her to believe that all her efforts to please were made for the purpose of winning influence that it might be used for the advancement of Miss Lopez's interests.</p>
               <p>The whole of the afternoon and a portion of the night were spent in card-playing, but at ten o'clock Mrs. Hawks retired, though her young slave had still to play softly upon the piano in the adjoining room till she fell asleep.</p>
               <p>But at last she was free, and she took possession of her room with a glad feeling of release. She leaned from her open window to catch the strains of gay music that floated up to her from the distant ball-room, her feet and fingers unconsciously beating time to them.</p>
               <p>Ah! if she had but wings with which to fly over to that scene of gayety and find a place among the brilliant crowd she panted to join.</p>
               <p>A whole week of seclusion seemed to her an endless cycle of time; like Tantalus, the draught for which she thirsted seemed ever evading her lips, and she rebelliously asked why was her destiny so changed from what she had once expected it to be?</p>
               <p>A feeling of rage took possession of her soul, and she wept such tears as do not soften the heart, or make it better. If her neglectful kinsman had seen her on that night as she paced to and fro the narrow limits of her chamber like a chained tigress, he would have felt dismayed at the results of the two years' discipline he had awarded her.</p>
               <p>It is true that they had taught her to depend upon herself, but in a way that was by no means desirable; and the one exulting thought she had this night was, that she was not accountable to any human being for her actions. A waif, cast upon the shores of time, she had a right to use any means she deemed good to advance her own interests and place her at the summit of prosperity.</p>
               <p>It was past midnight when she retired, but the sound sleep of youth and health soon came to her in spite of the previous tumult of her thoughts, and it was very late on the following morning when she awoke.</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6338-00000059"/>
               <p>Wondering why she had not before been called, Nina commenced her toilette, and soon afterward Mrs. Perkins came in. She said:</p>
               <p>"You have had a fine nap this morning, Miss Gordon; Mrs. Hawks wouldn't have you called till after she had her bath, and then Miss Inez came, and she wanted to talk with her alone."</p>
               <p>"Has Miss Lopez been with her aunt while I slept? I shall see her, I suppose, at breakfast?"</p>
               <p>"No you won't; for the poor thing has gone back to that old poky house in the country. I don't know what Mrs. Hawks said to her, but she looked as white as my handkerchief when she went down to get into the carriage, and the tears seemed ready to burst out of her pretty eyes. If you will find out what put her in such a state, Miss Gordon, I will try to do all I can to make your time less dreary than it would be if I chose to make you uncomfortable."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," replied Nina, coolly, "but I believe I already know what distressed Miss Lopez."</p>
               <p>The woman regarded her with an expression of surprise and mistrust, and incredulously asked:</p>
               <p>"What can <emph>you</emph> know about what passed between 'em this morning?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hawks spoke to me about a lover of her niece, of whom she disapproves. She told me that she intended to put an end to all hope of Miss Lopez inheriting her fortune, unless he is discarded."</p>
               <p>"Who is it?" asked Mrs. Perkins, in much excitement. "Not Mr. Fenton, I hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—it is Mr. Godfrey Fenton; and Mrs. Hawks has good cause to believe him as false as he is handsome and captivating."</p>
               <p>"I'll never believe it. Who has been poisoning her mind against him? A nicer, freer spoken young gentleman aint to be found, and I have seen enough myself to convince me that he loves the very ground my young lady treads on. Have <emph>you</emph> told her anything against him, Miss Gordon? for it seems to me that she couldn't have heard it from any other source."</p>
               <p>"Since you ask me, I will tell you the truth. I casually mentioned Mr. Fenton's name, and Mrs. Hawks drew from me some things I know about him, which, in justice to Miss Lopez, should be communicated to her. I presume she told her what I had said, and that is why she looked so agitated when she went away."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins' small gray eyes glared on her almost savagely, and she abruptly asked:</p>
               <p>"What was it you repeated, and how did <emph>you</emph> come to know anything of Mr. Fenton?"</p>
               <p>"I will answer you, though your manner of asking is not very respectful. Mr. Fenton was at college in New Haven while I was at school there. He bore the character of a most unprincipled trifler, and more than one young girl has cause to regret that she ever knew him. To get out of a serious affair in which he became entangled, he avowed his engagement to a young lady who lives in Mississippi, and under such circumstances he has no right to deceive Miss Lopez as he has done."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins clenched her hands and set her teeth hard together. She presently asked:</p>
               <p>"Who told you this, Miss Gordon? Are you perfectly <emph>sure</emph> of the truth of what you have said?"</p>
               <p>"As sure as I am of my own existence. If Godfrey Fenton is in earnest in his wooing, it is the first time he has meant anything more than to amuse himself. He is as hollow-hearted as he is fascinating, as more than one woman has found to her cost."</p>
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6338-00000060"/>
               <p>"Then God help my poor young lady, for she will never never love another! Oh, I know her well, poor child. I have known her from her infancy, and what she once attaches herself to she clings to with strength and constancy. You have done a cruel thing, Miss Gordon, though I will not accuse you of intending to make mischief. After a man is engaged, it often happens that he finds some one more attractive to him than the girl he had first fancied, and it is better for him to marry the one he likes best, even if he is accused of jilting the other. I don't believe in sacrificing one's life to such a scruple of honor as that."</p>
               <p>"You may be right, Mrs. Perkins; but Mr. Fenton has few scruples of any kind. He is not an honorable man, or he would never have played the part of lover to so many confiding girls. Believe me when I tell you that he is no more in earnest with Miss Lopez than he has been with a dozen others."</p>
               <p>"I won't believe that, for no one could play at love-making with such a girl as Miss Inez. If he didn't truly love her at first, he must soon have come to think her the sweetest and best creature in the world. If Mr. Fenton is bound to marry that other girl, I am sure that it is not an engagement of his own making, for if ever a man was truly in love, he is with my poor darling. If that will was only made, settling her aunt's fortune on her, he could afford to break with the other one, for I suppose she's rich, and he has always told Miss Inez he has nothing independent of his mother."</p>
               <p>"Then you would be willing to see Miss Lopez give her hand to a man who will not accept it unless she endows him with fortune?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins quickly replied:</p>
               <p>"He would accept it without a dime, for I know he loves her; but <emph>she</emph> would never consent to bring ruin on him, for she is as generous as she is true. Oh, dear! dear! it will break my poor child's heart to be forced to give her lover up. I know it will. I wish that you had said nothing about him, Miss Gordon. It would have been far better to let matters take their own course, without any interference on your part. Now that Mrs. Hawks has been prejudiced against Mr. Fenton, she will never be brought to listen to reason."</p>
               <p>"I felt compelled to speak when Mrs. Hawks questioned me, and I frankly told her what I knew about Mr. Fenton. When you are less excited, Mrs. Perkins, you will see that I did the best thing for your young lady's welfare."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins shook her head in dreary dissent, but at that moment the hand bell Mrs. Hawks kept beside her was shrilly rung. Both her satellites hastened to obey the summons, and they found her impatient for the appearance of the late breakfast. Mrs. Perkins rang for the waiter, and then went into the next room to superintend the serving of the meal.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks looked kindly at Nina, and said:</p>
               <p>"You look as I like to see young girls; calm and happy. Such a time as I have had with my niece this morning is enough to disgust me with life. I had just taken my bath, and was resting after it, when Inez came to make me an early call. She was looking unusually well when she came in, and I must say that she is extremely handsome. She was very affectionate, too, and seemed particularly pleased to see me, though she tried to evade what I had to say to her. But I wasn't to be put off, so I soon inquired after that good-for-naught who has been making love to her. You should have seen how beautifully her face lighted up at the mention of his name, and I declare that I hated to tell her that the creature has only been amusing himself with her all this time."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6338-00000061"/>
               <p>She paused to take breath, and Nina said:</p>
               <p>"It must have been a painful revelation to both her and yourself. I can very well understand that you must have shrunk from it."</p>
               <p>"Well, if Inez was like most other girls, I should not have minded it so much. But she is full of sentiment, and all that nonsense, and in everything that interests her, she is so much in earnest, poor thing! that it will really go hard with her to give him up. I led her on to speak of Godfrey Fenton, and she frankly told me that he has lately visited her, but he is at this time travelling in Canada, and will not return to Newport before the end of the summer. She said that nothing is wanting to their future happiness but the certainty of a sufficient income to live on, and she coolly asked me what portion of her grandfather's estate I designed to settle on her? I could hardly believe my own ears, for she knows that it was all left to me to do as I please with."</p>
               <p>"But I am sure it will please you to provide handsomely for your niece, madam," said Nina, with her most winning smile.</p>
               <p>"Not to enable her to marry the man she has set her heart on. I never liked Mr. Fenton, and now, he is quite out of the question as the future husband of Inez. If my money is to buy him for her, she shall never have him, and I told her as much. I gave her my reasons, and you should have heard her flame up in his defence. She refused to believe a word I said, and asked the name of my informant, which, of course, I didn't give her. I wish her to like you, and if she knew that you had given me to understand Mr. Fenton's true character, she would never forgive you."</p>
               <p>"You are very kind to think of me, dear madam, but I have no wish to strike at Mr. Fenton in the dark. I am quite willing to tell Miss Lopez all that is known to me concerning him. But it will be as well perhaps, to give me an opportunity of knowing her first."</p>
               <p>"Of course—of course—that was what I thought. When you have gained her confidence, as you will, for young girls thrown intimately together, must talk freely to each other, you can show her how artful and insincere this young man is. She will believe from you what she would not listen to from me. We will go to the Glades to-day in my carriage, and you shall see the miserable wreck that my sister threw herself away on. If Godfrey Fenton is really willing to marry Inez with such a burden as her father clinging to her, he must be taken with her in earnest. The old creature is unable to use his lower limbs, and <emph>I</emph> think him almost imbecile, besides being as cross as a bear."</p>
               <p>At the assertion that Fenton loved her rival, a pang of jealous fury darted through the heart of Nina, and she clenched her small hands as the thought came to her.</p>
               <p>"This man, heartless as I know him to be, is my <emph>fate</emph> after all. In spite of my bitter struggles to conquer myself, the mere intimation that he more truly loves another, has power to make me wretched."</p>
               <p>She commanded herself to speak in reply to the announcement of the intended visit.</p>
               <p>"I shall be most happy to accompany you to the Glades, madam, and I have no doubt that I shall find your niece charming."</p>
               <p>"You may take my word for that; but here comes Perkins to say that breakfast is ready at last, and I am sure that I am starving for it."</p>
               <p>Nina offered her arm, and they went into the adjoining room where an oval table was neatly set out with the elaborate breakfast Mrs. Hawks had ordered. She ate a portion of everything set before her, and Nina apprehended that another fit might be the result, which would deprive her of the drive she was anticipating with so much pleasure.</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6338-00000062"/>
               <p>But no such catastrophe occurred, and after reclining on the sofa a short time, Mrs. Hawks declared herself ready to set out for the Glades.</p>
               <p>The carriage drew up in front of a private entrance with which her rooms communicated, and the two ladies set out together, leaving Mrs. Perkins behind, much to her internal chagrin.</p>
               <p>The jealous fear came to the heart of the waiting woman that the new companion was making too rapid progress in the favor of her mistress to be quite safe, or agreeable, but she consoled herself with the remembrance of others who had preceded her in her present position, and, for a season, had been made as much of by the capricious old woman, and then were cast off at the lightest cause of displeasure.</p>
               <p>That Nina Gordon should obtain no stronger foothold than the others had secured, Mrs. Perkins had resolved, and secure in her long services, she believed she held the balance of power in her own hands. Whether this belief was well, or ill founded, will be seen in the progress of the story.</p>

               <head type="sub">LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG.</head>
               <p>THE carriage wound for several miles through a pleasant forest road, from which glimpses of the sea were obtained. It then turned off in a narrow tortuous way which barely afforded space for the vehicle to pass, and often the unpruned boughs of the trees brushed against the curtains as they drove onward.</p>
               <p>In a tone of vexation Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"I wonder why Mr. Lopez can't have the road opened better? Because he keeps no carriage of his own. I suppose he doesn't care how much his visitors are inconvenienced. Every time I come to the Glades I think it shall be the last; but as <emph>he</emph> can't move away from home I am forced to visit him myself. We have not very far to go over this rough road, I am glad to say, for another turn will bring us in sight of the old tumble-down concern we are going to. One might almost fancy it the castle of Udolpho, for it is grim enough to pass for anything that is gloomy and peculiar."</p>
               <p>As she ceased speaking the carriage turned into an extensive park, the gate to which had fallen from its hinges. The trees were thinned out apparently for firewood; but the undergrowth was as rank here as in the woodland through which they had passed, and the road to the house was scarcely distinguishable.</p>
               <p>In the distance loomed a tall stone building with wings on each side, and a dilapidated portico, supported on Doric columns, in front. The long grass grew thick up to the very door, and only on nearly approaching it was any evidence of habitation afforded.</p>
               <p>The east wing seemed to be occupied, for the heavy shutters were open, the windows raised, and a small bed of magnionette, geraniums, and other flowering plants, immediately beneath them, was redeemed from the surrounding desolation.</p>
               <p>White muslin curtains fluttered in the summer air, and as the carriage drew up a fair face appeared for an instant between their airy folds, and then flitted away.</p>
               <p>In another moment the heavy door opening on the portico swung back, and a young girl appeared upon its threshold. Much as Nina had heard of the charms of Inez Lopez, she was surprised by the singular loveliness of the face before her: by the stately grace of person which distinguished Godfrey Fenton's last love.</p>
               <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6338-00000063"/>
               <p>Inez was above the medium height, but so harmoniously proportioned, so graceful in her slightest movement, that Nina involuntarily applied to her the line of the poet: <q>
                     <l>"She looks a goddess, and she moves a queen!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Her complexion was of that pure marble whiteness so rarely seen with perfect health, and the delicacy of her skin was rendered more apparent by the intense blackness of her hair and eyebrows. Large, luminous dark eyes, shaded by long sweeping lashes, and lips of mobile expression, with a straight and finely-chiselled nose, and softly rounded chin, formed a face as lovely as ever painter or poet dreamed of as his fairest ideal.</p>
               <p>The light summer muslin she wore revealed the white beauty of her arms and shoulders, and the slender hand she extended in welcome to her guests Nina saw was exquisite both in shape and coloring.</p>
               <p>For an instant Nina almost hated her for the charms she was forced to acknowledge as far superior to her own; but when the expressive lips moved, and the soft sadness of her lambent eyes dwelt upon herself, she mentally said:</p>
               <p>"Born to suffer, if such a fate was ever impressed upon a woman's face. She will die or go mad under a disappointment which only imbitters my life. The conviction of his treachery will make hers worthless to her, or I am much mistaken."</p>
               <p>In soft but penetrating tones Miss Lopez welcomed her aunt and her young companion, and invited them to enter the house. The hall was an octagon, rising into a dome above, and a massive staircase, elaborately carved, wound upward, ending in a long gallery from which access to the upper apartment was gained.</p>
               <p>Massive chairs, too heavy to be lifted easily, stood against the walls, and a few pictures representing hunting scenes, hung above them. There were trophies of the chase, too, in the shape of deer's antlers, and over a huge, old fashioned sofa, a bear-skin was carelessly thrown.</p>
               <p>No dust or cobwebs were visible, though everything about the place had an air of antiquity and decay, that impressed Nina as unusual in so new a country as ours. She knew that, anterior to the revolution, the Glades had been the home of one of the wealthiest proprietors of the island; that fair women and brave men had been born beneath its roof, and borne from it to their graves; that ruin came upon the family to which it originally belonged, and the beloved home of several generations fell beneath the auctioneer's hammer, to its present occupant.</p>
               <p>But to him, its possession had brought only sorrow, for scarcely had he set up his household goods within the old walls, when his wife was taken from him. Then, after years of neglect and desertion, Mr. Lopez came back to this last remnant of his estate to find a shelter beneath the roof which could afford him little more.</p>
               <p>He owned but a few acres of ground around it, and these were suffered to lie fallow, with the exception of a small garden cultivated by a half-grown lad employed about the place. Inez led the way to the apartment from which she had issued, after saying:</p>
               <p>"My father is prepared to receive you, Aunt Eunice, so we will go in at once, if you please. He feels better than usual this morning, and—and—dear aunt, pray avoid saying anything that can annoy him. You know what a sufferer he is."</p>
               <p>Though she spoke close to Mrs. Hawks' ear, she imperfectly understood her, but she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh—ah—yes—I suppose you mean to say that I am to sit up on my good behavior? You always lecture me when I am going to talk with your father, but <emph>I</emph> can't help such a<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6338-00000064"/> volcano as he is, exploding. He does it without any provocation from me, for I always try to keep the peace with him."</p>
               <p>"I know that he is irritable, aunt, but if you or I were chained to the same place forever, we should lose our patience too. You know that he has a particular aversion to poodles, and I wish you would let me put Bijou on the bear-skin yonder until your visit is over. He will be quite safe and comfortable there."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks carried her pet in her arms, for she seldom moved anywhere without him, and with an offended air, she replied:</p>
               <p>"What! leave my darling Bijjer there to be scratched by Don Bobtail again? The last time I was here, that ferocious old cat of yours nearly finished him; and there he is now, I declare, ready to renew the fight."</p>
               <p>A cat of unusual size, with his fur mottled like a leopard skin, walked demurely forward, and cast a sidelong glance at his old enemy. Bijou uttered a frightened yelp as he caught sight of him, and Inez hastened to say:</p>
               <p>"I will shut Don Bobtail up, aunt, and Bijou shall not be interfered with."</p>
               <p>"You are very considerate, I dare say, Inez, but 'love me, love my dog,' is my motto, and if I go in to see your father, Bijjer must accompany me. I suspect that he will find it as easy to tolerate one as the other."</p>
               <p>There was nothing more to be said, and with a suppressed sigh, Inez led the way into her father's apartment.</p>
               <p>This was a large, square room, lighted by the two windows which looked out on the flower bed; the floor was covered with India matting, and the furniture was of modern manufacture, though made of cheap, and plain materials. The snowy curtains at the window, and vases filled with fresh flowers, gave an air of refinement to the apartment, and it was evident that the care of his daughter surrounded the paralytic with every comfort their narrow means brought within her reach.</p>
               <p>In a large morocco covered chair, placed in the centre of the room, reclined the wasted form of a man who had, in his youth, been noted for the graceful agility of his movements and the grand beauty of his person, now a helpless and hopeless wreck.</p>
               <p>From the father, Inez inherited the delicate contour of her features, and the supple grace of her form, while the brilliant fairness of her complexion had been the gift of her Saxon mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez was dark, as his countrymen usually are, and his large black eyes yet retained the animation and fire which disease had failed to conquer. He was wrapped in a damask morning gown, the bright colors of which were somewhat tarnished by long use, and a pair of embroidered slippers covered his small feet.</p>
               <p>He held out a thin, yellow hand, and in a fretful tone said:</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Eunice? I ought to say that I am glad to see you, I suppose out how can a poor d——l like me be glad of anything? But I must say that you would be twice as welcome if you came without the vicious little brute you carry in your arms. What an old woman wants with a creature like that to pet, I never could understand."</p>
               <p>His voice fell suddenly from the unusual pitch to which he had raised it, and he seemed gasping for breath. Mrs. Hawks had caught the meaning of his words, and she resentfully replied:</p>
               <p>"I dare say you are ready to add that those who care for them are nuisances too, eh? Wasn't that what you were going to add, if your breath hadn't failed you? But Bijjer is no pest, and I'll not have him called one by you or anybody<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6338-00000065"/> body else. You are an absurd old fidget to object to my pretty darling, and that's as bad as being an old woman, I guess."</p>
               <p>The lips of Mr. Lopez were suddenly drawn back, displaying a double row of white glittering teeth, which gave a most vicious expression to his dark face. They contrasted so vividly with his wan and contracted features that Nina wondered if they could be his own; but of his grand organization they were all that time and disease had left untouched. His teeth were white, and perfect as in his first youth, proving that, had he abstained from the dissipated courses which had wrecked his health, he would not have been a broken down valetudinarian at the age of forty-five.</p>
               <p>Inez hastened to avert the angry retort she anticipated, by presenting Nina:</p>
               <p>"Papa, pray speak to Miss Gordon, the new companion of Aunt Eunice. I think you will like her better than you did Miss Briggs."</p>
               <p>A glance at Nina satisfied Mr. Lopez that she was worth some consideration, for he was a great admirer of youth and beauty, and her fair loveliness was peculiarly attractive to him. The sardonic curl passed from his lip, and, with a courteous bow of his stately head, he condescended to say:</p>
               <p>"You are very welcome to the Glades, Miss Gordon. It is a miserable ruin in which to receive one's friends; not that a broken down man like myself can claim many such luxuries, for men and women, like rats, forsake a falling house. Friends are for the rich and prosperous, not for such as I now am. But how on earth did such a girl as you come to live with the old Hawk yonder? The last companion was grim, gaunt, and snuffy, and such a succession of feminine horrors as she has brought here with her at different times would astonish you. You are the first presentable person my respected sister-in-law has entrapped into coming to her, but I am afraid she won't keep you long. Come—tell me something about how you happened to come to her at all."</p>
               <p>Although the tone of his voice was so much lowered as to preclude all chance of being heard by Mrs. Hawks, Inez hastened to occupy the attention of her aunt lest she should be able to make out the tenor of his words from the motion of his lips.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez motioned toward a seat placed near his own; Nina sat down upon it, and turning her face toward him, gave him as much of her past history as she was willing to communicate. She ended by saying:</p>
               <p>"I like Mrs. Hawks very much, and feel the sincerest sympathy for her affliction. She is very kind to me, and the services I have to perform for her are neither burden-some nor disagreeable."</p>
               <p>"Umph! not even the eternal card-playing? You must be a phenomenon of patience, Miss Gordon; yet your face does not indicate that stamp of young person who can bear dullness and impertinence without rebelling against them. If you can stand that old woman yonder, so much the better for you; but <emph>I</emph> can't. Although, as you may have heard, I eat the bread purchased by the money she allows my daughter, I find it difficult to tolerate her; and she always will bring that hateful beast with her when she comes here, although she knows I cannot endure the sight of him. See now, she is actually placing him on my sofa without asking my leave. I only hope that the Don will come in through the window, and give him a good scratching before his mistress can rush to the rescue."</p>
               <p>Nina slily thought that she would enjoy the scene herself, for Bijou was no favorite with her, and she turned on her singular host a look of such suppressed fun, that he was<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6338-00000066"/> more captivated by her than before. But she demurely said:</p>
               <p>"In the event of such a catastrophe, it would be my duty to shield darling Bijjer from harm, so I hope Don Bobtail will be on his good behavior to-day."</p>
               <p>The words "darling Bijjer" seemed an echo of Mrs. Hawks' voice, and Mr. Lopez laughed aloud at the successful mimicry. He said:</p>
               <p>"You have a spice of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">diablerie</foreign> in you, I can see, Miss Gordon, but as stupid people never understand fun, you had better be on your guard. If the old woman suspected you of making free with her peculiarities in that way, she would set you adrift at once, as she has so many before you. She brings a new companion with her every time she comes to the Glades."</p>
               <p>Nina modestly replied:</p>
               <p>"I have been warned that Mrs. Hawks is capricious and hard to please, but I do not despair of making myself so necessary to her that she will find it hard to give me up."</p>
               <p>A slight frown contracted his brow, and after a pause he said:</p>
               <p>"There is one thing you must not do, Miss Gordon. You must not presume to attempt to rival my daughter in the good graces of her aunt. If justice had been done to Inez, half the old woman's fortune would have been hers. I have very strong reasons for believing that a deed of settlement was made by old Mr. Horton, leaving only a life estate in his property to the daughter who had no child; but it can't be found. A will was produced which gave her the whole of the estate to do with as she pleases, and thus my daughter is left at the mercy of her caprice. I accept the contemptible annuity she doles out to us, but as a fraction of what we are entitled to, and I often wonder at the meanness of Mrs. Hawks in offering Inez so small a share of the income she enjoys. Do you know that she has twenty thousand a year, and she only allows her niece six hundred? I have nothing left of my own but this house, and you may safely believe that I would seek a more cheerful residence if I had the means of living as I have been accustomed to."</p>
               <p>Nina looked sympathetic, and she softly replied:</p>
               <p>"That seems very little; but Mrs. Hawks will compensate Miss Lopez by eventually bequeathing all her savings to her. You may feel assured that I shall not attempt to interfere with her claims in any way."</p>
               <p>"You may, or you may not, for there is no telling what such a bundle of nonsense as Eunice Hawks may do. There is no relying on her two days at a time. You seem to be a quick-witted girl, Miss Gordon, and I think that you may gain some influence over her. If you will use it to induce Mrs. Hawks to execute a will without delay, naming Inez as her heir, I would not mind giving you enough to place you above the necessity of being the companion of any one. Say four hundred a year, as long as you live, and that is as much as she pays you, I fancy. Come now—what do you say? The old baggage may die any day, for she's in danger of going off the scene every time she has one of those attacks. Quick's the word, Miss Gordon; yes or no. She is nearly through with Inez, I know by her motions, and she'll be turning on me again."</p>
               <p>Though much amazed at this confidence, considering their brief acquaintance, Nina nodded her head intelligently, and was unclosing her lips to reply, when a shrill scream from Mrs. Hawks interrupted her, and that lady rushed in wild alarm toward the sofa from which sounds of suffering, mingled with yelps of fear and rage, were heard.</p>
               <p>A glance toward the scene of conflict assured Nina that the wish so lately uttered by Mr. Lopez had been realized,<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6338-00000067"/> for Don Bobtail had effected an entrance through the open window and pounced on his sleeping enemy, inflicting grievous scratches on his pink nose before any assistance could reach him.</p>
               <p>Lopez clapped his hands, showed his glittering teeth, and gleefully cried out:</p>
               <p>"Let 'em have it out, Eunice. Let 'em have it out! The dog is as large as the cat, and he ought to be able to defend himself. I declare it's a shame for you to interfere, for the sight of a good battle between those two belligerents would be a pleasant interruption to the monotony of my life. On that ground alone, you ought to be willing to let it come off."</p>
               <p>Though Mrs. Hawks could not hear his words, she guessed at their meaning, from the expression of his face, and she angrily said:</p>
               <p>"I dare say that a man who has thrown away his thousands in the cock pit and in the bull ring, would think it prime fun to see that spotted monster tear my poor Bijjer to pieces; but you shall never have that satisfaction, I promise you, Mr. Lopez. If that wretch can't be shut up when I come here, I shall stop coming, that is all."</p>
               <p>The dark face of Lopez grew almost savage, and in an angry voice he cried out:</p>
               <p>"If I risked money it was my own, and no one has the right to throw a reproach at me. Not even <emph>you,</emph> if I am compelled to accept from you the pittance that is grudgingly given, I know."</p>
               <p>"You know nothing of the sort. You are an ill-conditioned old ingrate, and if it wasn't for the sake of Inez, you might go to the almshouse for me."</p>
               <p>"You have told me that so often, madam, that it does not strike me as a novelty. As to myself, I can't see much difference in accepting your bounty or that of the State. At least, the latter would not always be reminding me of what it is doing for me. If you were not a stingy old curmudgeon, you would give Inez the portion of her grandfather's estate that should have gone to her mother; but you grasp the whole, though you are in no condition to enjoy it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed," replied Mrs. Hawks with cutting irony, "your expectations are moderate, Senor Lopez, considering that Susie's fortune was the price she paid for <emph>you.</emph> I don't think that you were worth the sacrifice of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, but my sister did not agree with me. Few men are worth so much, and I am sure <emph>you</emph> are not one of them."</p>
               <p>The taunt reached its mark; Lopez laughed sardonically, showing his teeth in a way that was almost frightful, when combined with the fiery gleams that flashed from his black eyes.</p>
               <p>He screamed at his antagonist,</p>
               <p>"It required all the old man's hoards to tempt Hawks to take <emph>you</emph> for his wife, and he paid a dear price for them, for you soon tormented him into his grave."</p>
               <p>At this retort the wrath of Mrs. Hawks culminated in what both the lookers on had been fearing. She fell back on the sofa beside her rescued poodle in a violent spasm, and lay so long in it that fears were felt by the whole party that she would never recover from it.</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa, what have you done?" exclaimed Inez, reproachfully. "You promised me to be on your guard, and yet you have done all you could to aggravate her."</p>
               <p>"She was up and at me first, Inez, and you know of old that I never fail to strike back. Throw some water in her face, and here are my smelling salts. They will either kill or cure; it don't matter much which. It would be a good thing for you if she did pass off. You would lose some of the personal property but you would come in for the bulk of her fortune."</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6338-00000068"/>
               <p>Inez was not listening to him, for she had rejected the use of the pungent salts, and was beside her aunt, raising her head, and ministering to her as tenderly as possible.</p>
               <p>Both she and Nina knew what was best to be done for the sufferer; and after half an hour of intense solicitude, they gladly saw her sink away into the deep sleep which always followed such an attack.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE OPIUM EATER.—INEZ AND HER LOVER.</head>
               <p>WHEN Mrs. Hawks' hard breathing began to echo through the room, the two girls looked apprehensively at each other, and Nina asked:</p>
               <p>"What is to be done now, Miss Lopez? Can your aunt remain here, or will it be best to have her removed at once to her own rooms at Newport?"</p>
               <p>"When she revives she will be sure to insist on the latter, but we must wait till she is in a condition to make her wishes known. If we decided on removing her she would be deeply offended. Have you not found it difficult to know what my aunt really wishes, Miss Gordon? She always seems to me to do exactly the opposite of what is desired by those around her."</p>
               <p>"I can scarcely answer that, for I have not been long enough with Mrs. Hawks to know much about her. It is but three days since I entered into her employment."</p>
               <p>"And three months is the utmost limit of time that any companion has remained with her. If you stay longer than that, I shall think you have more sweetness of temper and forbearance than most girls of our age possess."</p>
               <p>"You bear with your father," replied Nina in a guarded tone; "and he appears to me to be as excitable as this poor old lady, who seems to be left to the mercy of hirelings. I must bear with her humors for I have my living to make, and I cannot afford to be fastidious in the choice of my employment."</p>
               <p>"You have no friends, then?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, I have friends, and very good ones too, but none that I am willing to depend on. Your aunt has shown nothing but kindness to me, and I feel very grateful to her."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez here called out:</p>
               <p>"How am I to take my siesta, when the Hawk has taken possession of my nest? It's a confounded bore to have that snuffling and snoring in one's ears for two or three hours to come. What is to be done with the old girl when she 'wakes, eh, Inez?"</p>
               <p>"My aunt must settle that herself when she is in a condition to do so, sir. I will call Dick, and get him to wheel your chair into the hall. He can let the back down, and I will place pillows under your head. In that position you can sleep as well as on the sofa."</p>
               <p>"Well, well!" was the fretful rejoinder, "get me out of this as soon as may be, though I am not hospitable enough to care about being turned out of my own room to accommodate such a spiteful old cat as your aunt has become of late years. She has never liked me, and now I believe she only comes here to aggravate me in every way she can. If I had thought about the danger of throwing her into a fit, I should have been more careful, for I am sure I don't want her quartered on me through an illness, however brief its duration may be."</p>
               <p>Inez smiled faintly and sorrowfully, but she knew remonstrance to be useless—he would utter whatever came into his mind without regard to consequences—she only said:</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6338-00000069"/>
               <p>"You may be sure that she will be more anxious to get away than you can be to get her off. Papa, when she 'wakes, if she is unable to sit up, a bed can be placed in the carriage on which she can recline, and the drive to town is not long enough to fatigue her much."</p>
               <p>"Well, settle it the best way you can; only get me away from the sight of that purple face and the sound of that stentorious breathing. If the old hunks would have apoplexy, it would be something to the purpose. Three attacks would have floored her, but here she is hanging on to life after ever so many of these spells. The best thing she can do is to die, for she's of no use to any living soul, and a dreadful nuisance to some I could name if I chose to do so."</p>
               <p>Inez looked shocked and hurt, and she reproachfully said:</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, how can you bear to talk so? My aunt might retort by saying the same of you."</p>
               <p>"But in my case it would not be true, for I have you to care for me and grieve over my loss, little as I am worthy of it. I am of no use, I know, and a great trouble sometimes, but my little girl's heart would be sore if my chair was empty and a new mound made in the graveyard—eh, Inez?"</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush! don't talk of that!" replied his daughter, bending over him and tenderly kissing his forehead, "I will go now and bring Dick to remove your chair at once."</p>
               <p>She quickly went out, and presently returned with Mrs. Hawks' carriage-driver, who, after a glance of dismay at his mistress, performed the required service by wheeling the chair of the paralytic into the hall. He was closely followed by Inez, bearing pillows in her arms; and after lowering the springs of his seat, Mr. Lopez was comfortably established on his temporary couch and left to his repose.</p>
               <p>With a backward motion in the direction of the room they had left, Dick respectfully asked:</p>
               <p>"What is to be done now, Miss Inez? Mrs. Hawks seems to have been took with one of them spasms, and ma'be it'll be better to get her back to Newport afore she comes 'round ag'in. I can drive easy like, so as not to jolt her a mite, and p'raps 't will be better for you to have her moved afore she' wakes up ag'in."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! that will never do, Dick. I could not think of sending my aunt out of the house in her present condition. When she 'wakes, it will be time enough to settle what shall be done."</p>
               <p>"She'll never agree to stay here, nohow, Miss, and I thought it might be better for us all to get her away while she's in that dead sleep. But in course you know best what ought to be done."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez here spoke:</p>
               <p>"You are a sensible fellow, Dick, and I quite agree with your views, but Inez won't have it so, I know. Look after your horses now, and be ready at a moment's notice when you are called. Mrs. Hawks won't sleep more than two hours, and, when she 'wakes, the first thing she will order will be her carriage to take her away from here as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>The man nodded, went out, and Mr. Lopez settled himself among his pillows and closed his eyes. But before Inez could leave him, he flared them wide open again, and said:</p>
               <p>"My amiable sister-in-law has excited my nervous system to that degree that I cannot sleep without my usual sedative. Give me my opium, child, for in my present condition I cannot do without it."</p>
               <p>Inez earnestly remonstrated:</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, you will not take any more of that dreadful drug to-day? You have already had more than is good for you, I know, or you would never have allowed yourself to speak as you did to my aunt."</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6338-00000070"/>
               <p>"Fiddle-de-dee, child; what did I say to Eunice that she didn't deserve? Bring me what I ask for at once, or I will call on that young girl in yonder to wait on me. She seems a sensible and aocommodating creature, and I have no doubt she will do as I bid her."</p>
               <p>"Papa, darling father, don't insist on this, please. The doctor told me that you must not use so much opium. He says that it is slowly destroying both your mind and body—and——"</p>
               <p>Overcome with all the excitements of the morning, Inez broke into hysterical sobbing, and her father half-raised himself with an expression of startled surprise.</p>
               <p>"What can be the matter with you, Inez? You do not usually give way thus when your aunt and I have had a passage at arms. As to what Doctor Minturn says, <emph>he</emph> is no Solomon, and I know enough about my own condition to understand what is good for me. What are you crying about, child? When you came back from Newport this morning I noticed that something had happened to upset you, and you've not been yourself since. I insist on knowing what Mrs. Hawks said to you to make you unhappy."</p>
               <p>While he was thus speaking, Inez struggled to recover her composure, and succeeded as she had often done before when her very heart seemed dying within her. She repressed the convulsive sobs that arose in her throat, wiped away her tears, and gently replied:</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to tell you, papa. I was only thinking of you, and what the consequences may be of such unlimited indulgence in the pernicious habit you have formed. If you would only consent to lessen the quantity of opium taken every day, you might recover from your illness. But you increase it steadily, and I am beginning to lose all hope of restoration."</p>
               <p>"Hope! If Minturn has given you such a hope, Inez, he has wilfully deceived you. I shall never walk again, and I will not consent to live at all, if the only solace to my sad lot is denied me. Bring me the drug without exciting me further, lest the consequences be worse than you think."</p>
               <p>The struggle ended as many others had before, and with lingering steps Inez went into her father's room, and brought from it a small silver box, from which he took two pills, in spite of her efforts to induce him to take but one. After swallowing them, he closed his eyes and said:</p>
               <p>"Now go back to your aunt, and leave me to the only elysium I can ever again know in this world. I shall soon wander in the land of illusion, and dream of joys that earth knows not. Oh, child, do not grudge me the only happiness my broken and wasted life can now claim. This drug that you call a bane, is to me an elixir of happiness and power. While under its influence, I seem to grasp again my youth, my health, my fortune—all—that has gone down into the vortex of my own self-indulgence. I <emph>must</emph> have it, Inez, or go mad with baffled desires and vain regrets."</p>
               <p>The wild flashing of his black eyes alarmed her, and she soothingly said:</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself, dear papa, and I promise not again to excite you thus by refusing to you even the drug that is destroying you. Rest now, and forget that I have annoyed you."</p>
               <p>"I know that something has gone wrong with you to-day, Inez; but I can't excite myself now with talking over your affairs. It would destroy the happy influence I feel creeping over me already."</p>
               <p>He dreamily closed his eyes, and yielded his spirit to the influence of the subtle narcotic; after pitifully surveying him a few moments, Inez turned away, and softly glided into the chamber in which her aunt lay sleeping, and closed the door behind her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <head type="sub">NINA STRIKES A BLOW AT HER RIVAL.</head>
               <p>NINA had taken her bonnet off, and was quietly fanning Mrs. Hawks, and also keeping watch over Bijou to defend him from another attack from Don Bobtail.</p>
               <p>She would have cared very little if the belligerent cat had put an end to the poodle; but she feared, in the event of any further disaster happening to her pet, Mrs. Hawks might hold her responsible; and she began too clearly to see that her best interests might be served by remaining with that lady, to risk a dismissal by neglecting her favorite; so she wisely did what she knew would be most agreeable to her, by protecting Bijou from further molestation.</p>
               <p>The two girls had already silently taken the measure of each other, and Inez, candid, honest, and straightforward in her nature, was attracted by her new acquaintance, as most persons were who were thrown in contact with Nina Gordon.</p>
               <p>She looked up and smiled brightly as Miss Lopez approached her, though there was in her heart a deadly feeling of bitter rivalry between them; and Nina mentally vowed that if this girl had really won from her the heart of Godfrey Fenton, she would return the blow by depriving her of the greater portion of her anticipated inheritance. That once secured, she might, perhaps, regain the love she had lost; for, in spite of her angry and disdainful words when she and Fenton were last together, Nina knew that one word of love from his lips would bring her to his side forgiving and repentant.</p>
               <p>She remembered that he had then said if he could choose a dowerless bride she would be the woman he would prefer before all others; and with wealth at her command, why should she not be able again to lure him to her side? At the time he uttered those words they only filled her heart with angry bitterness; but she now acknowledged to herself that she could forgive them; that she could again receive him as the lord of her life if he could only convince her that his fancy for Inez Lopez was but one of the many flirtations into which he had so recklessly plunged.</p>
               <p>But not one of these emotions was visible on the tranquil surface. Her smile was as genial and sunny as that of an artless child, as she turned her face toward her young hostess and said:</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hawks already sleeps more quietly, and I think she will be quite restored in another hour."</p>
               <p>Inez sighed as she looked on the worn face, from which the purple flush began to fade, and, sinking on a seat near the sofa, said:</p>
               <p>"I am most thankful that she did not die. I feared more than once that she was gone; it was a frightful attack, and her physician says that there is always danger of death in one of them. It's a dreadful affliction, and one that is pronounced incurable. You must think ours a strange family, Miss Gordon, with two such helpless invalids to be taken care of. My aunt, you may have heard, was injured by a fall from her carriage; but my poor father's state is, I fear, the result of his own careless disregard of his health. He thought himself so strong as to be able to stand anything; but when misfortune fell on him he suddenly broke down, and became what you saw to-day."</p>
               <p>In tones of deep sympathy Nina replied:</p>
               <p>"It is indeed a sad thing to see a strong man, in the prime of life, reduced to the present condition of your father. No wonder that he is irritable."</p>
               <p>"You refer to what passed between him and my aunt to-day<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6338-00000072"/> day. It was a shameful scene, and could easily have been avoided if either of them had chosen to respect the peculiarities of the other. But they never will; there is a constant antagonism between them, and all I can do will not prevent an outburst whenever they meet. I sometimes almost wish that Aunt Eunice would not come here at all; but as papa can't go to her, I suppose she feels bound to visit him. I must explain to you, Miss Gordon, that my father is always under the influence of opium, or he would never have acted as he did to-day. In his natural state, he is a kind-hearted and cultivated gentleman; but in the shattered condition of his health, the only thing that affords relief to mental and bodily suffering is the constant use of the pernicious drug that has become a necessity to him. I can see how much it changes him from day to day, but there is no help for it; he must have the only thing that reconciles him to his sad existence."</p>
               <p>This explanation threw some light on the singularly confidential tone assumed toward her by Mr. Lopez, in the first hour of their meeting, and Nina said:</p>
               <p>"Then your father can scarcely be held accountable for what he says in a moment of excitement, and I shall use my best efforts to bring about a better understanding between him and your aunt."</p>
               <p>Inez gave her a penetrating glance, and nervously asked:</p>
               <p>"Did he seek your good offices or the furtherance of my interests, Miss Gordon? Excuse me, but my father is almost a monomaniac on one subject, and I fear that he will injure me with my aunt, by his attempts to win over those who are about her. I overheard something of what he was saying to you, utter stranger as you are to him. It annoyed, though it did not surprise me, for he has successively offered a bribe to my aunt's companions, to get her will executed in my favor. I hope he did not go quite so far with you in the first interview he has had with you."</p>
               <p>Nina hesitated a moment, and then frankly replied:</p>
               <p>"I thought it strange that Mr. Lopez should speak so freely to one so little known to him, but what you have just said explains it. He did offer me money if I would use my influence with Mrs. Hawks, to have her will made in your favor without further delay."</p>
               <p>Inez crimsoned, and then grew pale. In a pained tone, she said:</p>
               <p>"Poor papa; his mind seems daily less and less under his control. I trust that you will attach no importance to his words, Miss Gordon. It is the one desire of his life to see me rich, and he thinks my aunt unjustly withholds from me the portion of the estate that should have belonged to my mother. Of course it is her own to do as she pleases with, though I cannot help feeling that she is not as liberal as she should be. We always understood that although my grandfather disinherited my mother on account of her marriage with a man he did not like, he had no intention of leaving me without a provision. In the will under which my aunt claims the estate, my name was not mentioned: it was made before my birth, but my papa knows that a later one was made, though it could not be found. The lawyer who drew it up, assured my father that in that, half of the estate was left to me, at my grandfather's decease, and the remainder was to become mine at the death of my aunt. Under these circumstances, you cannot wonder that papa feels hardly toward her; and, in this dreary solitude, he has nothing to do but nurse his wrath, and bemoan the obscure bondage in which he chooses to think I am held by his infirmities and lack of means."</p>
               <p>"Dear Miss Lopez, I can understand and sympathize with his feelings; but you seem to bear your lot with the patience of an angel. You may rely on my efforts to serve you, if I can possibly do so. Mrs. Hawks seems very fond<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6338-00000073"/> of me, and humble as I am, I may be able to place your claims in a just light before her."</p>
               <p>There was the slightest possible touch of hauteur in the tone of her companion's voice, as she quickly replied:</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Miss Gordon; it was not to ask such service at your hands that I have been thus communicative with one so little known to me; but to deprecate any such use of your influence with my aunt. So far from serving me, you would but injure my cause, and she would be capable of taking from me the sum she annually allows me, if she thought those around her had been tampered with in any way. My aunt is a very peculiar woman, and she is determined to hold in her own hands as long as she lives, the power her wealth gives her. I entreat that what passed to-day between yourself and my poor half-dazed father, shall not be spoken of to any one."</p>
               <p>"If you desire it, of course not. After what you have said, I shall attach no importance to the words of Mr. Lopez, and I shall hasten to forget them as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; you are very kind. You are different from the other ladies my aunt has had in her employment, and I think you will please her better. I hope you will, for you are young enough to be a companion for me, and I have never known the happiness of claiming a friend of my own sex and age. Pray tell me how you came to go to my aunt, Miss Gordon, for I already feel an interest in a girl as young as myself, who seems even more desolate than I am."</p>
               <p>"How shall I thank you for those words of sympathy and kindness?" said the fair actress, with tears trembling in her expressive eyes. "I <emph>will</emph> tell you what I know of myself, but it is very little. Who, or what I am, I know not. I have been educated in the delusive belief that I was to fill a brilliant position in life, then cast upon the world to win my own bread, without a word of explanation, or a clue to my family. The very name I bear may not rightfully be mine, but I care little for that now. I have accepted the lot awarded me, with the determination to make the best of it. I dislike teaching, so I came to Mrs. Hawks, as her companion."</p>
               <p>Inez listened with vivid interest. She earnestly said:</p>
               <p>"I honor you for your independence and energy—for your confidence in yourself. You have been cruelly treated, though. You should have been told those things concerning yourself, which are now only painful causes of conjecture. In some respects, your fate is far sadder than mine."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Yours!</emph> Oh, Miss Lopez, if I had your beauty, your expectations, there is nothing to which I should not aspire. If you marry to please your aunt, you will eventually inherit the whole of her fortune."</p>
               <p>Inez shook her head and sighed heavily.</p>
               <p>"I shall not do that, for she has already declared her hostility toward my betrothed. My father approves my choice, but my aunt never liked my lover, and only this morning she gave me the choice to give him up or forfeit all chance of inheriting anything from her. I do not know why I speak so freely to you, Miss Gordon, but there is something about you that attracts confidence, and I feel sure that mine will not be betrayed."</p>
               <p>"Never! you may trust me as a sister. Pray call me Nina, and let me be really your friend. I too am attracted toward you in a degree that I have rarely felt to a stranger."</p>
               <p>Inez held out her hand, and with charming grace replied:</p>
               <p>"We will be friends, Nina, and henceforth to you I am Inez. We shall often meet while my aunt is in Newport,<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6338-00000074"/> and you must aid me to keep peace between her and my father."</p>
               <p>"Yes—that shall be our compact; and now, having won your confidence, sweet Inez, will you not consent to put my sincerity to the test by allowing me to mediate with Mrs. Hawks in favor of this lover of yours? Tell me his name, and where he lives; give me the 'lay of the land,' that I may serve you intelligently."</p>
               <p>Inez shrank from the confidence demanded. She changed color and trembled as she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh no, no—I cannot do it. Nothing would move my aunt, and Godfrey himself would deprecate the thought of winning her consent to our union through such questionable means."</p>
               <p>Nina started as naturally as though she had not expected to hear that name. She shivered as it came from the lips of her rival, for her very manner of pronouncing it proved how tenderly she loved the man who bore it. She repeated:</p>
               <p>"Godfrey—it is not a common name, but I once knew one who bore it. He was a student at Yale while I was at school in New Haven; but it is impossible that the Godfrey I knew and he to whom you refer should be the same person."</p>
               <p>"Why impossible?" asked Inez, a sudden thrill of fear shooting through every fibre of her being, though it would have been impossible for her to have explained what she dreaded. "Godfrey Fenton <emph>was</emph> a graduate of Yale, and it is scarcely two years since he left there."</p>
               <p>Nina covered her face with her hands, and after a silence which Inez had not courage to interrupt, she looked up again so pale that she found voice to falter:</p>
               <p>"Why are you so deeply moved, Miss Gordon? Are you—are you known to Godfrey Fenton?"</p>
               <p>Nina cried out with passionate fervor:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Inez—Inez, can you ever forgive me when I tell you that <emph>I</emph> have been the cause of your aunt's anger against your lover? I knew him, alas! too well, for he has played with my heart, as he is now doing with yours. I told Mrs. Hawks the story of my short life, and betrayed to her the wrong this too fascinating man has been guilty of toward me. His name accidentally escaped my lips, and Mrs. Hawks drew from me what I would have torn out my tongue sooner than utter, if I had dreamed of the evil it might do. Good heavens! you are ill—you are fainting!'</p>
               <p>Inez had sunk back on her seat, so white, so still, that she looked like the image of death, but she had not lost her power to feel and suffer. She gazed blankly at the girl who had just dealt her so fearful a blow, and with a shiver slowly turned her eyes away from the imploring face of Nina. She faintly said:</p>
               <p>"No—I am not ill; I shall be better presently. Wait—wait, till I recover breath to speak."</p>
               <p>"I have ruined <emph>his</emph> cause with her forever," was the triumphant thought that came to Nina, but she veiled her exultation by an expression of the keenest sympathy and remorse. She deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"Oh! if I had only known—if I could only have dreamed of the mischief I was doing! But Mrs. Hawks led me on, till she discovered all she wished to know; and I felt so friendless, so forlorn, that I was glad to confide my troubles to her as to a maternal friend. Dear Inez, tell me that I have not done you an irreparable wrong."</p>
               <p>By this time Miss Lopez had recovered the power of thought and speech. The deathly pallor of her face changed to a more natural hue, and she steadily said:</p>
               <p>"If treachery has been practised toward me it is best to know it in time. I refused to believe my aunt's assertion<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6338-00000075"/> this morning; but I cannot refuse to listen to what you have to say. The love that is not founded on the truth and honor of the one to whom it is given, is of little worth. I believed in Godfrey Fenton as a true and noble man, but if he is what you assert him to be, I can no longer trust him. It is due to <emph>him</emph> to hear what you have to say of him; to require you to place in my possession the proofs of your assertions, for you must not forget, Miss Gordon, that you are but slightly known to me, and in a matter so vital to my happiness as this, I must have the amplest confirmation of your words before I can accept them as the truth."</p>
               <p>Nina coldly replied:</p>
               <p>"Such proofs as you require I can scarcely give, for no correspondence took place between Mr. Fenton and myself. I have no written record of the words he has spoken to me again and again, but they are indelibly engraved upon my heart. Oh, Inez! he won me by that guileful tongue of his; he wooed me in every way possible, and for a whole year I walked in the delusive paradise created by the hopes he held out to me. To the very last he wore the deceitful mask, and it was only on the eve of our final separation that all the falseness, all the hollowness of the nature I had believed so noble, was laid bare before me. The anguish, the struggle that followed, I will not attempt to describe; but now I have but one feeling toward Godfrey Fenton, and that is, supreme scorn and contempt. He is unworthy to brush the dust from your feet, much less to clasp your hand in betrothal; and it is better for you to know this now than to give him the power to desert you as he has so many others. I knew him to be a trifler, but to me he seemed so devoted, that, as you say, I believed in him. And then, in that last bitter interview, he told me that if I were endowed with fortune he would prefer me to every other woman in the world, but dependent as he was, it was impossible for him to marry a penniless girl."</p>
               <p>"Did he say <emph>that?</emph>" came from the pale lips of the tortured listener.</p>
               <p>"Those were his words, but of what worth were they, Inez, when he left me? Yes—left me, to seek one more brilliantly endowed. I will not accuse Mr. Fenton of mercenary views; but if you had not been the presumptive heiress of twenty thousand a year, do you suppose that he would ever have asked you to become his wife?"</p>
               <p>She paused, exhausted by the vehement outpouring of her long pent up wrath, and eagerly watched the effect of her words on her victim.</p>
               <p>Most unwillingly did poor Inez recall the circumstances of her first meeting with Fenton; for they gave some confirmation to the doubts expressed by Nina. She was in New York with her aunt for a few days' shopping; their carriage got into a jam on Broadway, and Mrs. Hawks became so much alarmed that she was seized with one of her spasms. Fenton was passing the side walk, saw that the slender girl in the carriage could scarcely sustain the struggling form of her aunt, and he at once turned aside, wrenched the door of the vehicle open, and stepping in, at once relieved Inez of Mrs. Hawks' weight.</p>
               <p>He then gave such directions to the driver as enabled him to extricate the carriage from its dangerous position, and gain a side street. He remained with them till Mrs. Hawks was safely removed to her own house, and then offering his card to Inez, explained who he was, and requested permission to call again, and inquire after her aunt.</p>
               <p>This was readily granted, for Fenton's person and address had already most favorably impressed her, and his humanity and coolness had won her deepest respect.</p>
               <p>Henceforth he came every day during her stay in New<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6338-00000076"/> York, and she soon knew that it was not his interest in Mrs. Hawks' state of health that drew him to —— street, so much as that he had conceived for herself.</p>
               <p>One day Inez overheard a conversation between Fenton and her aunt's physician, which she now recalled with bitter anguish. She was in a recess, hidden by folds of heavy drapery, when the two, who had entered the house together, paused so near the door of the parlor, that she could not avoid hearing all that passed between them.</p>
               <p>"You are a lucky fellow, Fenton," said the doctor, "to have served so lucky a girl as Miss Lopez. One, too, who will be very rich when the old woman goes off the scene, and she can't last much longer."</p>
               <p>To this Fenton had replied:</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about Miss Lopez' prospects, nor do I care to discuss them. She is fair enough herself to turn most men's heads without the addition of fortune."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I understand all that; but money is a good thing too, and she'll have plenty of it. You must manage to keep on the right side of the old lady, my boy, remember that."</p>
               <p>"I shall scarcely take the trouble to do that," was the indifferent reply. But Inez remembered with a sharp pang that he <emph>had</emph> courted her aunt's good graces, and most signally failed to win them; for, in spite of the service he had rendered her, Mrs. Hawks never could forgive him for having seen her under the distorting influence of one of her worst spasms.</p>
               <p>His stay in New York continued as long as that of Miss Lopez, and he devoted himself to her in every possible way. Inez took pains to let him know her exact position, and how doubtful it was as to her becoming the heiress of her aunt's wealth; but this made no apparent impression upon him.</p>
               <p>Fenton soon followed her to her desolate home near Newport, and, nothing daunted by the sight of her helpless father, spoke to her of love and marriage.</p>
               <p>Inez listened in perfect faith to his assurances of unfailing devotion; for how could she doubt him after such evidences of affection? He spoke frankly of his own worldly position, but never hinted at the tie which bound him to Opal Hastings; and Inez confidingly believed herself the first love of his wandering heart.</p>
               <p>It was clear from what Fenton said of his own prospects that, without a settlement from Mrs. Hawks, he could not venture to marry her niece; but Inez still believed in the perfect purity and disinterestedness of his affection for herself. Such women trust implicitly, if at all; and until this day the poor girl had never cherished a doubt against him.</p>
               <p>Fenton had visited the Glades several times, and was always welcome, always agreeable to Mr. Lopez, who was almost as much charmed with his gayety as his daughter was with his sentiment. At the command of his mother, he was travelling through the North; but the fair magnet at the Glades attracted him thither at every interval he found it possible to spare from the extensive tour he was required to make.</p>
               <p>Of late he had pressed for an understanding with Mrs. Hawks, and some certainty as to what he and Inez could depend on from her in the event of their union. He had often assured her that he would not seek to make a new home for himself, but would render the Glades more habitable, and bring around her paralytic father such society as he was capable of enjoying. His own mother had younger children, he told her, and to them she could turn for consolation for his abandonment of his native home for the sake of the girl he loved.</p>
               <p>After hearing from Mr. Lopez the history of her grandfather's will, Fenton had insisted that Inez was entitled to the enjoyment of the half of his estate, and he declared it to be shameful in Mrs. Hawks to withhold it from her. In<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6338-00000077"/> stigated by a recent letter from him, Inez had only that morning made a final appeal to her aunt, which was met with a decided refusal, accompanied by the revelation of Godfrey Fenton's double dealing.</p>
               <p>Inez refused to believe her aunt's statement, but here was confirmation that she could not doubt. He had wooed and won another before they ever met. In place of being the high-souled man of honor to whom she believed she had plighted her troth, he was but a contemptible and heartless flirt; solacing his own exorbitant vanity at the expense of bleeding hearts and blighted hopes.</p>
               <p>Ah! it was too bitter!—too humiliating!</p>
               <p>After reviewing all these incidents, Inez vaguely repeated the last question of Nina:</p>
               <p>"Would Godfrey Fenton have asked me to become his wife if I had not had the prospect of inheriting great wealth? Was not that what you said? Yes, I remember now. Twenty thousand a year is a great deal of money, and it may have been a temptation to him aside from myself. Perhaps he would never have wished to marry me but for the prospect of that; but then it is not really mine, you know; and he seemed so earnest, so truthful, that it is hard to believe him false. I am too wretched, too much bewildered, to know what to think about it. My senses seem to be forsaking me in the crisis in which I most need them."</p>
               <p>Nina offered her a glass of water, and then, in her liquid, penetrating tones, asked:</p>
               <p>"Did Mr. Fenton ever hint to you why he wished to live so far away from his Southern home, Miss Lopez?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes," she eagerly replied. "He said, that afflicted as my poor father is, he could not take him among his own connections to make a spectacle of him; neither could we leave him to the mercy of servants; so <emph>we</emph> must stay with him and make a pleasant home for him. It was Godfrey's thoughtfulness for poor papa that filled up the measure of my confidence in him."</p>
               <p>"And he hinted at no other reason?" asked the insidious voice.</p>
               <p>"No; I remember no other. Do <emph>you</emph> know of any?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do. Mr. Fenton has been more frank with me than he seems to have been with you, though the circumstances were different. I had no possible fortune to bestow on him, so he could afford to tell me the bare and revolting truth that, while he was playing the part of a devoted lover to me, his hand was already plighted to a young girl in Mississippi. His mother sent him on his travels till Opal Hastings is old enough to become his bride."</p>
               <p>"Opal Hastings! that is the girl my aunt spoke of, but I would not listen to her. I refused to believe her assertion, though it made me inexpressibly wretched. And you confirm it! You, then, were her informant. Why should he have told <emph>you</emph> of her, when he has never mentioned her name to me?"</p>
               <p>"To crush out the love he had been at such pains to kindle," replied Nina, disdainfully. "He placed my rival before me, and bade me despair. Inez, do as I did; tear the image of this treacherous man from your heart, and, in its place, enshrine there contempt, and aversion for the false one who has wrought so much woe to us both. Let him not have the triumph of knowing how deeply he has wounded you. Strike such a blow at him as he will feel in his turn, by refusing to see him again, and ceasing to communicate with him in any way. Should any doubt arise as to the disposal of Mrs. Hawks' fortune, he will return to his first allegiance, and desert you as he deserted me. There is no truth in him—none—none!"</p>
               <p>Inez dropped her colorless face upon her hands, and seemed absorbed in thought. After a long silence, which<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6338-00000078"/> Nina thought it best not to interrupt by any further appeal to her pride, she at length spoke in a low, pained tone:</p>
               <p>"I believe that you are quite right, Miss Gordon, and I am weak to hesitate. But you do not know—you can scarcely understand what Godfrey Fenton has been to me in the last four months of my life. He brought life, and hope, and joy to this desolate roof. He is already like a son to my poor stricken father, and this blow will fall almost as heavily on him as on me. Oh! Nina Gordon, I wish we had never met, for the meeting has brought to me sorrow unspeakable!"</p>
               <p>"Yet, it was plainly my duty to warn you of the precipice on which you stood," said Nina, gently. "Forgive me for the pain I have caused you; it was involuntary on my part. Remember that I too have gone through the slough of despond into which this man's want of principle has plunged us both."</p>
               <p>"Yes," was the faint response, "I must remember that, and the certainty of his double treachery will enable me to sustain my pride. I shall write to Mr. Fenton, and tell him that all is over between us; that he must come here no more. <emph>No more!</emph> Oh! if you could measure the depth of desolation those words express for me!"</p>
               <p>Yielding at last to the overwhelming agitation she could no longer repress, Inez burst into such a passion of sobs and tears, as touched even the compassion of her who had thus struck her to the heart. Nina used every effort to soothe her, but she impatiently turned from her, crying out, in tones of piercing anguish:</p>
               <p>"Let me alone—say no more to me on this subject, for I cannot bear it. You have destroyed the life of my life, and now talk of hope or consolation for that which I feel to be irremediable. You have broken my heart, but you did it for my good, and I will not reproach you if I can help it. There—there—pray be silent, or I shall go mad at once."</p>
               <p>Nina said no more. She had accomplished all she proposed to herself, and prepared for her recreant lover as unlooked for a blow as she had herself received at his hands, and she was satisfied with her day's work.</p>
               <p>She quietly took up her fan again, and resumed her occupation of watching Mrs. Hawks' slumbers.</p>
               <p>Inez at length roused herself from the passion of anguish into which this revelation had thrown her, and going into her own chamber, bathed her eyes, and smoothed her hair. She gradually made up her mind that to Fenton himself she would appeal for information of what had been told her. From himself should come the fiat that separated them, for if he acknowledged the truth of what Nina had told her, she could have no claim on one so false and light of nature as he would thus prove himself to be.</p>
               <p>The long habit of self-control before her suffering father, enabled her to put sufficient constraint upon herself to return to her guest, looking very pale and worn, but outwardly composed.</p>
               <p>After a keen glance at her, Nina thought—"She bears it better than I believed possible. She loves him less than I do, or she would never be so calm," and the remembrance of her own rebellious struggles, brought a faint flush to her cheeks, and a pang to her heart.</p>
               <p>Inez quietly said:</p>
               <p>"You have done me a service, Miss Gordon, for which I should thank you, but I cannot quite yet. We will suffer this subject to drop between us forever, if you please, and now I must turn from sentimental suffering to the prosaic realities of life. My aunt always requires food when she awakes after one of her attacks, and I must see that Nora has something for her that will please her palate. Pray excuse me while I go out and order luncheon."</p>
               <p>After a brief absence, Inez returned, followed by a neat<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6338-00000079"/> looking Irish girl, who quietly and deftly set out a small table, threw over it a damask cloth, and placed on it a tempting repast, ready for the sleeper when she should awake.</p>
               <p>Her preparations were scarcely completed when Mrs. Hawks yawned, opened her eyes, and staring around her in an amazed way, asked:</p>
               <p>"Where am I? What has happened to me? Have I been ill again? Oh! I remember now. Where is my darling Bijjer, and what has become of the spotted monster that attacked him?"</p>
               <p>Inez hastened to reply</p>
               <p>"I have had Don Bobtail shut up, aunt, and I'm glad to see you quite well again. You have been taking a nice siesta, and I have your lunch with hot tea ready for you. Nora shall bring it in at once."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks sat up and looked around her. She seemed pleased with the thoughtful attention of her niece, and said:</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my dear. I am very hungry, and you seem to have something nice there. But what has become of your father? I hope that I have not driven him from his own room."</p>
               <p>"Oh, he is often wheeled into the hall at this warm season, and Dick removed his chair there after you fell asleep."</p>
               <p>"Won't he come in and join us now? I believe we had a row as is usual when we meet, but I have forgotten all about it, and I shall be on my good behavior till I go away."</p>
               <p>"He has fallen asleep, aunt, and I would prefer not 'waking him. He has his meals served whenever he feels like eating."</p>
               <p>"There—a nice time you and Nora must have, I declare. But it's none of my business,—and I understand very well why you can't wake him up. It's the old story, I suppose."</p>
               <p>Inez looked distressed, and, struck by the pale sadness of her face, Mrs. Hawks suddenly asked:</p>
               <p>"What's the matter with you, child? Haven't you been crying your heart out since I went to sleep? Your eyes look very suspicious."</p>
               <p>"Why should I cry, Aunt Eunice?" she lightly asked. "Come—I will draw the table nearer to the sofa; and if you will not sit up, you and Miss Gordon can take your lunch together. Nora will be back with the tea directly."</p>
               <p>The old lady's attention was diverted to the delicacies on the table, for Inez had taken care to provide such things as she knew her aunt particularly liked. Nora made a diversion in her favor by bringing in the fragrant tea, and the three drew up to the little feast.</p>
               <p>Nina waited on Mrs. Hawks, and then partook of the repast herself; but all that Inez attempted was to swallow a small portion of the steaming liquid, every drop of which seemed as if it would strangle her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks did not remark her want of appetite, for she was too busy ministering to her own wants and selecting tempting titbits for her dog.</p>
               <p>Orders were dispatched to Dick to have the carriage in readiness in half an hour, and when the sound of the wheels was heard they all arose, and the visitors prepared to leave.</p>
               <p>As she went out, Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"I do not know that I shall come back here at all, Inez. After what passed between your father and myself to-day, I think I had better stay away from the Glades. We can't meet without quarreling, so we had better not meet at all. You can come to me every day, and thus the peace will be kept. Good-bye, my dear. Tell old Opium that I left my<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6338-00000080"/> sincere hope that he will reform his habits and let the drug that is killing him alone. Look at him now as he lies there in that cadaverous sleep. I declare it is frightful to think of a man bringing himself to such a pass as that."</p>
               <p>Inez hurriedly said:</p>
               <p>"Don't, aunt; if you love me, pray avoid commenting on my poor father's weakness. Spare him for my sake!"</p>
               <p>"Well, since you ask it in such a deplorable tone, I'll do as you wish; but if he'd spare himself, it would be more to the purpose."</p>
               <p>Carrying her darling Bijou in her arms, Mrs. Hawks was at length got safely in her carriage and driven away.</p>
               <p>At the last moment of parting, Nina spoke in low tones to Miss Lopez:</p>
               <p>"Forgive the wound I have inflicted on you to-day, and believe that it was not willingly done. Dear Inez, the great wrong committed against us both should make us friends."</p>
               <p>To this Inez made no reply—she only bent her head and made a feeble attempt to smile on the false one who so eagerly desired to win her confidence.</p>

               <head type="sub">A DREAMER'S VISIONS ASSUME A TANGIBLE SHAPE.</head>
               <p>WHEN Inez Lopez was left alone, she sat down with that stunned feeling which comes after a severe mental shock. She tried <unclear>to</unclear> recall every word uttered by the insidious lips of Nina, and as she remembered the passionate and excited manner of the girl, she could not doubt that of herself she had spoken the truth—spoken from the depth of bitterness that Godfrey Fenton's treachery had stirred within her heart.</p>
               <p>Inez thought that she could have forgiven him for carrying on a flirtation with an attractive girl while in college, from which nothing serious was intended to ensue; but she then felt as if it would be impossible to pardon him for concealing from herself the fact of his engagement to another. He must have been bound in honor to that one, yet he had sought her love as though it were the most precious of earth's possessions to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez continued to sleep heavily for many hours, and after composing herself sufficiently to undertake the task she meditated, she went into her own apartment, and, with a trembling hand, sat down to reply to Fenton's last letter.</p>
               <p>It lay upon her portfolio, and she took it up with a feeling of faint sickness, and read over again the tender and passionate outpouring of feeling she had lately believed as genuine as the affection she had bestowed on him. Her lips curled bitterly when she came to that portion in which he urged on her the necessity of coming to an understanding with her aunt as to what she was to do for her in the event of their marriage, and she murmured:</p>
               <p>"Oh, how could I have been so blind, so easily deceived? Nina Gordon is right—but for the prospect of wealth before me, he would never have asked me to become his wife. Yet he seemed so earnest—so truly attached to me, that it is hard to distrust him, even after such evidence of his want of faith. I will not condemn him unheard; from his own hand shall come the confirmation of what has been told me, or I will refuse to believe it."</p>
               <p>She took up her pen, and rapidly wrote a succinct statement of all that had occurred, (as to Godfrey,) between Mrs. Hawks, Nina and herself; informing her lover that Mrs.<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6338-00000081"/> Hawks would probably leave her but a slender annuity, and might bequeath the bulk of her property to Nina, in which case, he (Godfrey) "could perhaps yet win Miss Gordon for his wife." She concluded by saying:</p>

               </q>
               <p>Having accomplished this painful task, Inez gathered together the precious memorials of Godfrey Fenton's love—his letters, a ring he had given her, and a lock of his soft, lustrous hair, and placed them in a secret drawer of her desk. She then took from her neck a fine gold chain, from which was suspended a locket containing his miniature; but she would not open the case to indulge herself with a single glance at the beloved face lest it might unnerve her for the duties of the evening; for, in spite of her own suffering, Inez thought with pity of her father's chagrin when her blighted prospects should become known to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez had formed a strong attachment for Fenton, and she knew that he indulged the hope that through him such brightness as his own life might yet know was soon to come in the shape of a more comfortable home, and social intercourse with those from whom he had hitherto held himself aloof.</p>
               <p>After bathing her face to remove all traces of emotion from it as far as possible, she went out to Nora to order her father's late dinner, and with her own delicate hands prepared an omelette which she knew he particularly liked.</p>
               <p>By this time Dick had returned with the carriage, and after setting the table in her father's room, Inez called on the driver to wheel his chair softly back to his own apartment. She hoped that the motion would arouse him from the lethargy into which he had fallen, and such, in fact, was its effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez dreamily opened his eyes, and asked:</p>
               <p>"Where are you taking me? Not back to hear that d—l's chorus that I came away to get rid of, I hope. If the Hawk is still in my nest, I decline occupying the room at the same time. We are not 'birds of the same feather,' and a battle always takes place when we come together."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa," said Inez, from the back of his chair, "my aunt has been gone some time. Hereafter, I think, perhaps, it will be best for me to visit her in Newport, in place of her coming here."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart, for I am sure the sight of her cross old face is enough to make my eyes ache. She is no more like your mother than if they were not of the same blood. Susie was fair as a snow-drop, and gentle as a woman should be if she is true to the nature God meant to implant in her.</p>
               <p>Dick placed his chair opposite the open window through which the evening air was wafted, and Inez hastened to draw up the table, and summon her handmaiden to serve the delicate repast which had been prepared for him.</p>
               <p>To this Mr. Lopez did ample justice, but with much effort did Inez force herself to swallow a few morsels when her father noticed her want of appetite. She accounted for it by saying that she had taken luncheon with her aunt not very long before, and he laughed, and said:</p>
               <p>"Her lunch and your dinner. Her hours and yours don't agree any better than her temper and mine. So I missed the tempting meal you prepared, for no doubt you gave the old girl the best that was to be had."</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6338-00000082"/>
               <p>"Yes, I tried to please her; but what was set before her was no better than what is now before you."</p>
               <p>"I can easily believe that, for you are an inimitable housekeeper and a most dainty caterer for a sick appetite, I must say. But this hap-hazard way of living can't last much longer, Inez: my dear boy will soon be coming back to us, and then we must force some kind of settlement from your aunt that will enable us to live more like people of our station should."</p>
               <p>By this time the servants had left them alone, as it was the habit of Inez to wait on her father at meals, ringing the bell when they were over for Nora to remove the things.</p>
               <p>As he spoke thus, Lopez looked up at her, and for the second time that day the sad expression of her face struck him forcibly. He hastily said:</p>
               <p>"Something <emph>has</emph> happened to vex you, child, and you are concealing it from me. What did that old catamaran say to you this morning? I insist on knowing; she is always badgering one or the other of us, but I'll find means to pay her out yet, crippled as I am, see if I don't."</p>
               <p>Inez gravely replied:</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa, I have something to tell you, but we will wait till the table is cleared. We cannot speak freely together till then."</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose I shall have to submit to be ruled by you as I always am. But when the things are taken away, I shall expect the whole truth, mind you."</p>
               <p>She sighed softly as she repeated:</p>
               <p>"Yes, the whole truth, though I am afraid that you will not like it."</p>
               <p>"That's as it may be; I choose to know it at any rate."</p>
               <p>When the cloth was at last removed, Nora, unbidden, placed a chess-board and men upon the table, as the evening amusement of Mr. Lopez was playing that game with his daughter. He always insisted on being the victor, and Inez good-naturedly allowed it, though she was much the best player of the two. His sources of enjoyment were narrowed down to so few, that she could not deny him the triumph of conquering her in their mimic trials of skill, much as it sometimes tested her forbearance to do so.</p>
               <p>She began mechanically to arrange the pieces, but no sooner had the door closed on the Irish girl than Mr. Lopez pushed the board away, and leaning back in his chair, fixed his eyes searchingly on his daughter, and said:</p>
               <p>"Now, I am quite ready for what you have to say, Inez. Begin, if you please, with what passed between yourself and your aunt this morning."</p>
               <p>After a slight effort to steady her voice, Inez recounted to him as precisely as possible all that Mrs. Hawks had said, and without allowing herself to pause between them, went on to the occurrences of the latter part of the day.</p>
               <p>She told him enough of what had passed between Nina and herself to enable him to come to his own conclusions as to the guilt or innocence of the man they had both so highly estimated. Her father often interrupted her with exclamations of incredulity, or anger, but when she had finished her painful recital, he struck his hand so violently upon the table as to set the chess men spinning in every direction, and said:</p>
               <p>"I'll never believe it! never! It's a shameful lie hatched up between your precious aunt and that young serpent, who I begin to believe is ready enough to undertake anything that will please a rich woman like old Hawks. I hope you won't credit them, Inez, or write to Godfrey as if you mistrust him. He loves you, child; I know he does, and if there is any sham about him, it was acted towards that infernal girl—never, never with you. What if he did flirt with her? there was no harm in that. All college students<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6338-00000083"/> have such experiences in their verdant days, and are none the worse for them afterwards. The girl, no doubt, did all she could to attract him, and now she asks you to cast him off because she couldn't entrap him into marrying her. I know something of life, Inez, and of men, and if ever true love was felt for a woman, I know that Godfrey Fenton feels it for you in all its depth and intensity."</p>
               <p>"I thought so too, papa," was the subdued reply, "but it seems that he has no right to love me. You overlook the worst feature of the case, his previous engagement to Miss Hastings."</p>
               <p>"Miss Fiddlesticks! That young tigress has wrought that part of the story out of her own fertile brain. I shall not credit a syllable of it, nor should you. Upon my word, if you allow yourself to be cheated out of such a husband as Fenton will make, you'll not deserve to find one at all. He is the noblest, most whole-souled fellow breathing, and I insist that he shall have fair play, in spite of all these malicious women can say against him."</p>
               <p>"That is my wish too, papa, and I have already written to him telling him the whole story, and asking him to defend himself, if it is in his power to do so. I would not condemn him unheard."</p>
               <p>"I hope that your letter has not been sent to the office, for I wish to add a few lines to it myself, telling Godfrey how utterly I disbelieve the whole thing. I shall invite him to come here at once, and face his enemies."</p>
               <p>"It is too late to do that, for Dick took my letter to town while we were at dinner. I thought it best to send it off before speaking with you, lest you might wish me to delay a little. I cannot live in this suspense. I must know what is to be known as soon as possible. I have given Mr. Fenton the opportunity to defend himself, and if he cannot do that, all must end between us."</p>
               <p>Her father looked at her with rage and amazement contending for the mastery.</p>
               <p>"You say that very coolly, but your white face, and heavy eyes, tell their own tale. I tell you, Inez, that the loss of this man's love will break your heart, and wreck the last hope in life that remains to me. Look at me—think of what I have borne, and remember what Fenton has become to me; what he promises to do for us both; and then, if you <emph>can,</emph> say again that all shall be over between you. It shall not be; you shall marry him yet, and get back your poor mother's portion. It has been unfairly withheld from you too long already, and I will find means to make old Hawks disgorge her plunder. Oh! you needn't look at me in that way, for I am terribly in earnest."</p>
               <p>Inez arose, knelt down before him, and placing her bowed head upon his knee, she tremulously said:</p>
               <p>"Papa—darling papa, don't pain me by such violence. I cannot bear it. Be gentle with your poor Inez, for she needs kindness this night more than she has ever done before in her whole life. I have done what I thought right, and we must leave the issue in the hands of a higher power."</p>
               <p>Lopez reverently made the sign of the cross on her pale brow, and then more gently said:</p>
               <p>"God knows I think more of your happiness and welfare than of my own; but it angers me to see your faith in a true man tampered with, and unsettled by those two women who came here to-day bent on an errand of mischief. I only wish that Fenton had a fortune of his own; for he would soon show them then that your aunt's money was not what he was thinking of when he sought you. He has always known that there are strong doubts as to your getting much of it, and he only asked for enough from her<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6338-00000084"/> hordes to enable him to marry you at once, without any danger of all of us coming to want. Till lately I would have compromised with Mrs. Hawks for five thousand a year; but now, I will not do that. We will have half, and the balance at her death. Get up, child, and sit on this ottoman at my feet, for I have something very strange to tell you."</p>
               <p>Inez silently obeyed him, wondering what new fantasy had taken possession of his mind, for his thoughts often wandered strangely. She looked up at him in the gathering twilight, and saw from the glitter of his eyes, and the nervous trembling of his lips, that he was greatly excited.</p>
               <p>He presently went on:</p>
               <p>"Opium is a strange thing, and it puts odd notions in my head sometimes, but its use exalts the perceptive powers, and brightens the faculties to an almost supernatural degree; at least, that is my experience of its effects. Of late, while under its influence, I have had remarkable visions, one of which comes back to me so often and so clearly, that it must have some significance. I have often tried to remember if your mother ever told me of a hiding place for papers in the library at Oakland, but I do not think she ever did. Besides, what I am going to tell you, she could hardly have known till she met her father in the spirit land, and he communicated it to her."</p>
               <p>"Poor papa," thought Inez, "his mind is weakening day by day, and he will soon live more among the phantoms evoked by that dreadful drug than among the realities that surround him."</p>
               <p>She assumed an interested look, and Lopez went on:</p>
               <p>"I see that you are listening to me; that you will hear the strange revelation I have to make without trying to convince me that there is nothing in it. Inez, of late your mother has often been with me when I sleep. I have seen her in all her early beauty, before the hand of disease marred her soft girlish loveliness, for she was a charming creature when we first met. I did not cherish her as tenderly as I might, perhaps, for there is little of softness in my nature, but I loved her with the selfish fervor of such temperaments as mine. I adored her, yet I would not control my passionate and jealous nature, and I made her wretched. She never gave me cause to doubt her devotion to me, yet I could not bear that she should give one smile or a courteous word to any other man, and I forced her to give up the society in which she found appreciation, to live alone for the husband whose moody temper made her life a torment."</p>
               <p>He paused, and Inez tearfully exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me of such things, papa! Why should you abase yourself before your own child? and accuse yourself of greater wrongs than I am sure you could have committed."</p>
               <p>"Because some expiation is demanded of me, I suppose. I don't know what prompted me to go into these painful details, for that was not what I intended to say. However, as I have commenced my self-accusing confession, I will go on to the end. I took my wife to my secluded plantation home in Cuba, where not a soul came near her that could speak her own language, save myself and the woman who nursed you. There you were born, and my poor Susie's health failed so rapidly that the doctors said she must return to her native air.</p>
               <p>"I bought this place and brought her here for the summer, but we received no company, and it was the lack of human sympathy, of the social enjoyments I denied to her, that was slowly sapping the springs of life. The words of her father were proving true; he said to her when he refused his consent to our union——</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6338-00000085"/>
               <p>"That jealous demon will break your heart, and I will not give you to him."</p>
               <p>"See how well the old man understood me—how literally his words were fulfilled! Inez, I saw your poor mother fading hourly before my eyes, yet I would not summon around her those who might have saved her. I was not a popular man in society myself, and I could not bear to see her surrounded by others, and amused by them, while I was left to the indulgence of my own morose humor. But I was bitterly punished, for I think she grew melancholy mad before she died——"</p>
               <p>Inexpressibly shocked, the poor girl cried out in anguish:</p>
               <p>"Why should you tell me this? Why foreshadow the fate I may learn to fear as my inheritance. Oh, father, have you no pity for me?"</p>
               <p>"He cynically repeated:</p>
               <p>"Pity?—yes—I do more than pity you, Inez; I mourn over your lonely lot—your broken fortunes, even more than over the loss of health and strength to myself. I hardly know why I give you these wretched details, but something forces me to do it.</p>
               <p>"Remorse drove me to the dissipation that wrecked me in every way. For years after her death I beheld your mother's image ever before me, looking just as I had last seen her on earth—wan, wasted, broken-hearted. But that phase passed away, and since my affliction she comes to me only as a spirit of light, clothed in the beauty of the radiant sphere to which she now belongs. In my dreams she speaks with me—consoles me for my sufferings, in her own angelic way. That is why the drug I take is so precious to me; for no sooner am I completely under its influence than my guardian angel is beside me, breathing peace and comfort into my soul.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, after all this preamble, I have come to what I set out to tell you. Of late, Susie speaks only of you and your future. Twice she has distinctly told me that her father's last will is still in existence; she says that it was concealed by Mr. Horton, lest it should be destroyed, and it is still in the old house at Oakland.</p>
               <p>"She minutely described an octagon room lighted by four narrow windows, which was added by Mr. Horton to the house, and used by him as a library. In the spaces between the windows, book shelves are placed, and behind the highest row of books in the case, on the left side of the door as you go in, close examination will disclose a spring concealed under the edge of the shelf.</p>
               <p>"If that is firmly pressed on, the wall will slide down, leaving a narrow cavity exposed, and in that is concealed your grandfather's last will. He intended to write to Susie, send her his forgiveness and inform her of its hiding place, but death anticipated him, and he would not confide his intentions to me. The instrument under which Mrs. Hawks claims the estate was executed in the height of his anger at Susie's elopement with me, but that was cancelled by one made subsequent to your birth."</p>
               <p>Inez listened to these circumstantial details with vivid interest, though she could put but little faith in them as revelations from the world beyond. She thoughtfully said:</p>
               <p>"It is very strange that such a dream should have come to you; and you say that it has been repeated, papa?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and each time with the same clearness and precision of detail; but when I ask, 'how am I to get possession of the will?' the answer always is, 'that remains for Inez to accomplish, for you can do nothing yourself.'"</p>
               <p>"For me! Oh! what could <emph>I</emph> do toward carrying out anything as intangible as a dream? Dear papa, your mind has dwelt so constantly on this subject that your sleeping<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6338-00000086"/> visions have unconsciously been influenced by it; but there can really be nothing in it."</p>
               <p>Lopez curtly replied:</p>
               <p>"Don't be a simpleton, Inez, and turn coward when you should be most courageous. This mission is delegated to you, and by you it must be fulfilled. What adds to my confidence in the truth of my vision is that such a room exists at Oakland. I was received in it by your grandfather when I asked his consent to the marriage of his younger daughter with myself, which was refused on no other ground than my foreign birth and the faults of temper he had remarked in me. A scene of bitter anger and recrimination ensued, and I avenged the insult he offered me by inducing his pet and darling to forsake him and link her destiny with mine. The old man never recovered from the blow. His health failed him, and he spent several years in travelling. I believe that the news of Susie's death gave the last blow to him; for, not very long afterwards, he was found dead in his bed when they went to arouse him in the morning.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Hawks took everything; but then I did not care, for your mother had been so recently taken from me that I had no thought to bestow on the injustice which had been done to you. It was not till after I lost my own fortune that I awoke to the wrong from which you were to suffer. I opened a communication with Mrs. Hawks, who had recently married, and she replied to it by sending me a copy of the will which gave the whole of her father's property to herself.</p>
               <p>"Things went worse and worse with me, and finally I came here to take shelter; by that time Hawks was dead, and your aunt Eunice a childless widow. I again appealed to her, and the only result was to wring from the stingy old creature the miserable pittance on which we have since lived. Your aunt and I never liked each other, and, I believe, it was her influence that poisoned her father's mind against me, and prevented him from accepting the overtures of reconciliation your mother persisted in making as long as she lived."</p>
               <p>He paused, and with some effort Inez said:</p>
               <p>"It is a very sad story; but unless my aunt chooses to right the wrong that has been done, I cannot see how it is to be remedied. How <emph>I</emph> am to get possession of the will I cannot see, even if such a thing is in existence. I should not even know how to seek the paternal home of my mother."</p>
               <p>"You can easily learn that much. Oakland lies on the Narragansett shore, not above fifty miles from here. On it is a square brick house, with a tower at the western angle, and in that is the library of which I have spoken. Since the death of her husband Mrs. Hawks has never lived there, and the place has been rented, together with the farm lands attached to it.</p>
               <p>"So firm is my conviction that the will is concealed in the place indicated by my dream, that I insist that you shall visit Oakland, obtain access to the library, and make an effort to gain possession of the will."</p>
               <p>"But how am I to do that, papa? Do you know anything of the people who occupy the place? If you are not acquainted with them, under what pretext could I intrude into their house?"</p>
               <p>"'Where there's a will there's a way,' says the proverb, and a wise one it is, especially in this case. I do not know much of the tenant, but enough to answer your purpose. He is an ordinary farmer, with so small a family that he requires but two of the rooms in the rear of the house to live in. The others are shut up, with much of their furniture still in them. The library has scarcely been used since<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6338-00000087"/> Mr. Horton's death, for neither Eunice nor her husband had much taste for books, and I don't think Wilkins, the tenant, likely to meddle much with your grandfather's collection."</p>
               <p>"I visited the place once after he took possession, and found him to be a good, practical farmer, but surprisingly ignorant and careless about everything else for a Yankee. You know they think a man is next to nothing unless he has what the darkies call 'booktionary larning.' Somebody said 'a little learning is a dangerous thing.' I suppose Wilkins took this to heart, and, as he had not time to acquire a good stock of the article in question, he would not risk meddling with it at all. He is a good-natured, primitive fellow, originally from Vermont, and as verdant in some respects as his native hills. When you see him, you will find that my description is what critics call graphic."</p>
               <p>"Do you really expect me to go on such an errand as this, papa? How can I leave you so long as it will take me to visit Oakland?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! as to that, Nora can be trusted to take care of me for a day or two; and when I tell her that you have gone away on business of mine, she will not attempt to pry into what does not concern her. I have been thinking of this for several days past, and been contriving ways and means to accomplish it, for my heart is set on verifying the truth of my vision. It will take you but two days to go and return, and the announcement of your name, with the addition that you have come to get a rare book from the library for the use of your infirm father, will suffice. Wilkins will not trouble you with scruples or objections, for he knows my near connection with the Horton family, and he would not dare to refuse you access to any room you wished to visit."</p>
               <p>After a thoughful pause, Inez said:</p>
               <p>"I will undertake this strange errand, since you have it so much at heart, papa; but it must be on one condition. You must name some particular book which you know to be in the library, and ask permission of my aunt to have it brought away. Unless she gives an order in writing, I scarcely think the man in charge of the place would be justified in allowing me to remove one."</p>
               <p>"What if he didn't, so your object was gained by getting into the library. <emph>That</emph> is what you have to do, and you must linger there till you have an opportunity to examine the shelf behind which the spring is situated. That once found, the rest is easy. If the will is there, you can easily conceal it about your person, and nobody be the wiser."</p>
               <p>"Well, dear papa, we will speak further of this to-morrow, and then we can decide what is to be done. Shall I light the lamp, and have our game of chess before tea is brought in?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, child, and we'll have more games than one, for I feel quite fresh after my long nap to-day."</p>
               <p>He did not notice the wan and weary face opposite to him, the eyes glistening with unshed tears, and the tremulous motion of the flexible lips as she bent over the board, moving the pieces often at random, but still playing well enough to interest him deeply.</p>
               <p>It was late when they separated for the night, and when Inez kissed him, and left him to the care of Dick, the only comment he made on her appearance was:</p>
               <p>"How pale you are, child. Don't let all this worry about Godfrey prey on your spirits. <emph>He</emph> is all right, be sure of that, my girl."</p>
               <p>Inez would have given much to be able to believe him, but she dared not. Worn out as she was, she could not sleep till toward dawn, and when she awoke a low fever hung about her which she would not acknowledge, though it sapped her strength from hour to hour, till she could no longer sustain herself, and was forced to take to her bed, and have a physician called in.</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6338-00000088"/>
               <p>Dr. Minturn said she had received a severe mental shock, from which her nervous system was suffering, and he prescribed sedatives, and recommended perfect repose of mind and body; as if the first would not seethe and riot in its misery, however passive the last might be.</p>
               <p>Lopez chafed and worried over this delay in making the investigation he was so anxious about, but there was no help for it. Inez was too much indisposed to leave home, and he had the superstitious belief that to her alone must be entrusted the recovery of the important document on which her future prosperity depended.</p>
               <p>Inez dispatched to her aunt a few half illegible lines informing her of her inability to go to her, but promising to do so as soon as her health permitted.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DESPAIR OF A YOUNG HEART.</head>
               <p>DICK arrived with the carriage at the hour named for Mrs. Hawks' afternoon drive, and the note of Inez was taken up to her by Mrs. Perkins.</p>
               <p>She and Nina were playing backgammon, and the latter was seemingly in the gayest and brightest spirits. Her patroness already began to think her the most charming young person she had ever known, and she blessed the hour that delivered her from the prosy lectures of Miss Briggs, and gave her a companion so congenial in every respect as she found Nina to be.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins approached her mistress with a silver waiter in her hand, on which the note of Inez was placed. With a contracted brow, Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"What does Inez mean by sending an excuse, in place of coming herself? I am not accustomed to neglect, and she had better look to herself, or things may not go on so well with her as she could wish."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Perkins hastened to explain that Inez was ill in bed; that Dr. Minturn had been with her, and ordered her to remain perfectly quiet.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, that is different from wilful neglect. If she's sick, of course, she can't come; but it's unlucky for her that she should be ill just now. What does she say, Nina? Read the note to me."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Nina,</emph>" thought the indignant maid. "I wonder what that familiarity means. Mrs. Hawks never called her companion by her first name before, but this young woman seems to be carrying everything before her. If she only means fair by Miss Inez, it's all right; but if she <emph>don't,</emph> oh, Lor'! it makes me sick to think of what may happen. She's mighty takin' in her ways, for sure, and she can do more with that doited old body there than ever I can, after all my years of faithful service."</p>
               <p>With intense irritation she waited until Nina opened the note, glanced over the few lines it contained, and then read them aloud to Mrs. Hawks. The latter sniffed, and, with a dissatisfied toss of her head, said:</p>
               <p>"It's short enough, and not a word about the state of my health in it. After the trial I went through yesterday with that brute of a father of hers, it was as little as Inez could do to inquire how I had passed the night, and whether I am better this morning. Oh, my dear, I only wish that my niece had your sensibility to suffering, and your graceful tact in saying just the right thing at the right moment."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins would not wait for the reply that rose to Nina's lips. She indignantly said:</p>
               <p>"Them that feels most ain't them that always has pretty<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6338-00000089"/> words to tickle people's ears with. <emph>My</emph> young lady is above sich things, but you'll never find anybody that cares for you so much as Miss Inez does, in spite of all the fine talk. The poor child is broke down with all she has to go through with, and now when she wants some one to comfort her and look after her, you seem ready to turn your back on her, and she your sister's own born child too."</p>
               <p>At this unlooked-for outbreak Mrs. Hawks opened her eyes so widely that the white ring around them was more conspicuous than ever, and angrily said:</p>
               <p>"I will not bear with such impertinence from you, Perkins. You think that you have become so necessary to me that I will not part from you under any provocation; but if this is repeated, I warn you that I shall at least make an effort to get another to fill your place. I have changed companions till I have at last found one to suit me, and I may chance to have as good luck if I determine to change my maid."</p>
               <p>"Very well, ma'am, you can make the trial if you choose; but when it comes to nursing a woman afflicted as you are, you won't find many that is either capable or willing to undertake the job. You know how many you had afore I come to you, and how glad you were to get a reliable person to be always near you?"</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Nina took a pencil from her pocket and hastily scribbled a few words on the back of Inez's note. She took Mrs. Hawks' glasses from a table near, and presenting the two to her, spoke in a low but distinct tone to the waiting-woman.</p>
               <p>"You are very injudicious, Mrs. Perkins, and such language can only injure the cause you are so anxious to serve. Leave the interests of Miss Lopez in my hands, for they are safest there; and pray do nothing to induce your mistress to believe that you are jealous of the influence I am acquiring over her. It can do no good and may lead to your own dismissal. I should regret that, for I should not not know what to do without you if you were sent away. Besides, as we are both interested in the same cause, it will be better that a good understanding should exist between us."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins keenly regarded the fair, open face of the speaker, and then bluntly asked:</p>
               <p>"But are we interested in the same cause, Miss Gordon? It seems to me that you are more intent on making your own way in Mrs. Hawks' good graces than in doing anything for my young lady. I begin to fear that the day that brought you to our house was a dark one for Miss Inez."</p>
               <p>"Fie! Mrs. Perkins, why will you talk so unreasonably? Is it not necessary to the success of what you have most nearly at heart that I should win the confidence of Mrs. Hawks? I have pledged my word as to the use to be made of my influence, and that should satisfy you. Leave me to play my own game, and I shall win this one, if I'm forced to let the old lady be victor in those we play at cards and backgammon."</p>
               <p>The witchery of persuasion that dwelt on the lips and in the eyes of Nina Gordon served her turn as deftly as usual. Against the intuitions of her better judgment, Mrs. Perkins was persuaded that Nina was but carrying out their compact, and she more graciously said:</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry I spoke so quick like and said what I did about you, Miss Gordon. I hope you mean fair, and somehow I am forced to believe in you when you speak with me; though, at other times, I'm fearful that you are thinking more of yourself than any one else."</p>
               <p>"I will tell you the truth, Mrs. Perkins," said Nina, with an air of perfect candor. "I intend to have that will executed before we leave Newport, and it is but fair that I<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6338-00000090"/> shall be handsomely remembered in it; but I pledge you my word that the bulk of Mrs. Hawks' fortune shall go to her niece. Does that satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, y-e-s, I suppose so. A few thousand dollars more or less won't signify where there's so much; and of course you must be paid something for your services."</p>
               <p>"Then we understand each other, and you will be more careful how you speak to Mrs. Hawks. We could not afford to part from you on any terms, Mrs. Perkins, for <emph>I</emph> can do nothing but amuse her, and you are the mainstay of the concern. You shall not be forgotten either, I assure you, when the old lady comes to make her bequests."</p>
               <p>Though chafed and irritated at the patronizing tone assumed by Nina, the woman nodded acquiescence, and Mrs. Hawks, who had by this time read over what Nina had written and also the apology sent by her niece, laid down her glasses and interrupted the conversation of which she had been blissfully unconscious, for Nina stood behind her, and her infirmity prevented her from detecting the low murmur of voices near her.</p>
               <p>She sharply said:</p>
               <p>"Miss Gordon intercedes for you, Perkins, and, in consideration of that I overlook what passed here just now. I don't deny that, in many respects, you suit me better than any one I could find to put in your place, but you had better not flare up about Inez every time her name is mentioned. It is injudicious, to say the least of it, for such conduct on your part can't be of any service to her."</p>
               <p>"I begin to see that now myself, ma'am, and if you'll excuse me, I'll be more thoughtful in future. I'd be sorry to leave you to a stranger, for no one could understand as well as I do what must be done for you when you are took with one of your spells."</p>
               <p>"Very well—all is right between us again, and you can bring me my drops. Then tell Dick to drive close to the door and be ready when I come down."</p>
               <p>The drops were administered, and Mrs. Perkins went on her errand. Nina brought Mrs. Hawks' bonnet and shawls, and arranged them on her becomingly, and then donned her own hat, throwing over it a thick veil under the pretext that the sea-breeze would tan her complexion; but she really desired to conceal her features from observation, as she did not wish to be recognized as the companion of Mrs. Hawks when she made her début in the ball-room under the chaperonage of Mrs. Bates.</p>
               <p>But her precautions were useless, for they did not join the gay cavalcade that wound along the fashionable drive leading to Fort Adams. At the command of his mistress, Dick turned off into a deserted country road, on which they encountered not a single horseman and but few pedestrians.</p>
               <p>Nina would not suffer her vexation to appear, but she had earnestly hoped that she should at least obtain a glimpse of the brilliant stream of equipages of which she had heard so much. Mrs. Hawks said in explanation:</p>
               <p>"The bustle and heat are too much for me on the beach, and I never go there. The carriages drive so close too, that I am in continual terror less some awkward fellow may lock wheels with mine and cause a regular stampede. It is wonderful to me that accidents do not oftener happen, for the way the young men dash along is shameful. It looks as if they don't care for their own necks nor those of other people."</p>
               <p>"I think it is much pleasanter here," replied the young hypocrite, with her soft smile. "Nothing is more charming to me than a drive through a forest road, with the great trees arching overhead and the sunshine dancing through the leaves upon the green turf below. We can at least hear<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6338-00000091"/> the distant sound of the surf breaking on the beach and feel the buoyant influence of the sea-breeze, if we cannot see the ocean."</p>
               <p>"I see that you know how to make the best of everything, my dear, and such a spirit in a young person is worth untold gold. Now that we are safe away from Perkins, I wish you to tell me if anything passed between you and Inez that could have upset her so. She seemed well enough when she came to see me yesterday morning, and in no danger of an attack of sickness. But she did begin to droop before we left the Glades, and I thought you might have dropped some hint that confirmed what she had refused to believe from me."</p>
               <p>Nina looked calmly in her face and replied:</p>
               <p>"I did not hint anything to Miss Lopez, Mrs. Hawks, for that would have been a cruel and underhand mode of proceeding that I should have found very repulsive. I found an opportunity while you and her father were sleeping to tell her the whole truth; and I repeated to her, without reservation, all that had passed between you and myself concerning Mr. Fenton."</p>
               <p>"And how did she receive it?"</p>
               <p>"At first with incredulity; but my manner of telling my story at last impressed her, I could see, and I am sure she ended by believing every word I said. She declared that she would write to him, for from himself alone would she accept a confirmation of my statements. I was satisfied that she should do so, for Mr. Fenton will not dare to deny what he stated to me himself, and his engagement to Miss Hastings seemed to wound her more deeply than the fact that he had once been in love with me. <emph>That</emph> she might have excused as only a thoughtless flirtation, but the other stamped him with deliberate treachery, and your niece seems one of those high-strung young ladies who think more of honor than of any other quality in a lover. I think you may consider the affair as ended, for in my opinion Mr. Fenton will not put forward his pretensions again. He will fully understand that he can never recover the position in the estimation of Miss Lopez that he once held; so he will wisely go back to his own home and claim the hand of the girl who has the best right to him."</p>
               <p>"How coolly you talk of this man, toward whom you have acknowledged you once felt so differently," said Mrs. Hawks, fixing her strange eyes inquisitively upon her. "You are stronger than that poor infatuated creature at the Glades, for she is no doubt breaking her silly heart over the worthlessness of a man who seems to make the jilting of thoughtless girls the business of his life."</p>
               <p>Nina disdainfully replied:</p>
               <p>"Why should I not speak coolly of one who has sunk to the lowest level of contempt in my estimation? I wish to know nothing more of Mr. Fenton or his doings, and I have endeavored to save your niece from becoming the victim of his specious and false words. If she were endowed with fortune, all my efforts might prove fruitless, for I am sure she loves him to that degree that she would listen to his excuses and pardon him for deserting his plighted bride for herself. But unless she has money, and a great deal of it too, Godfrey Fenton will never make the attempt to regain her confidence."</p>
               <p>"Then he shall never have that temptation, for I shall make it an express condition in the will I intend to make, that if she marries Mr. Fenton she shall forfeit all I intend to leave her, save an annuity which will barely support her. I think that will be checkmate to him."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you, but pray don't talk of making your will, dear madam. There is time enough ages hence for that, for you are looking well and strong enough to live many<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6338-00000092"/> years yet. I trust you will for my sake, for I begin to cling to you as tenderly as if you stood in the relation to me of the mother I never knew."</p>
               <p>She lifted the withered hand of Mrs. Hawks to her lips and softly kissed it. The subtle flattery of this girl rarely failed to reach its mark, and the old lady looked at her more kindly than she often did at anything save her darling Bijou, and said:</p>
               <p>"You are an affectionate, sweet creature, Nina, and I only wish that I had such a daughter of my own. While I talk to you I could almost fancy that the days of my youth have come back again, and Anna Moore and I were gossiping together once more. It must be the wonderful resemblance you bear to her that attracts me so strongly to one I have known so short a time."</p>
               <p>"It may be that, dear Madam, but when I am sensible to the same attraction toward you, there must be something more in it than that. Don't you believe in the doctrine of affinities? What I mean by that, is, that certain people mutually find in each other that which is most pleasing and attractive to them. The chance which threw you and me together affords an illustration of my theory. I find you most lovable, and you, in your turn, condescend to be pleased with my poor little efforts to win your regard."</p>
               <p>Such flattery as this, accompanied by bright smiles and tender looks, was not often offered to the weak and wilful woman left at Nina's mercy, and she accepted it as eagerly as that designing young person could have wished.</p>
               <p>She drew Nina toward her at the risk of waking the poodle who was slumbering on her lap, and affectionately said:</p>
               <p>"You are a sweet, darling creature, and I can never thank Mrs. Bates sufficiently for giving me the opportunity of knowing you. Stay with me as long as I live, Nina: become come the child of my affections, and I promise to do the part of a good mother by you. I have no one to love me, for Inez is wrapped up in that selfish old father of hers, and thinks me nothing in comparison with him. If she had shewn for me half the affection that you have, I would have done anything for her. I believe that I could even have given my consent to her marriage with that young Fenton, and given her money enough to make it worth his while to take her, but she was not permitted to attach herself to me. Her father hates me, and has taught her to distrust me, so that we do not get along together as aunt and niece should."</p>
               <p>"Let me repay you for her indifference," said the pleading voice of Nina, which seemed endowed with the magic power of penetrating the dulled ears of the deaf woman, for she understood every word spoken to her by those subtle tones. "I have none to love me; I have been cast upon a cold, unsympathizing world, without ties, that I might find a home in your tender heart. Is it not so, my dear and valued friend?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—henceforth your home shall be with me; and in return for your devotion to my happiness, I will give you a mother's care; and when I die, Nina, you will find that I have not forgotten you. That is, it shall be so, if you continue to be as necessary to me as I begin to find you."</p>
               <p>Nina understood perfectly what the last reservation meant. She was to be a slave to Mrs. Hawks' caprices as long as her services were needed, and if she still continued to please her by her unsparing flatteries, she might hope to regain her reward by rivalling Inez, and securing to herself the fortune of her patroness.</p>
               <p>She was satisfied with such success as had attended her manœuvres, and felt with elation that the prospect was brightening before her. With her finesse, and Mrs. Hawks' susceptibility to flattery, she doubted not the result of the<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6338-00000093"/> daring scheme she had formed. In what had just passed between them, she discovered what she had not before suspected; that this hard and imperious woman shared that craving for affection which is common to all humanity, and through this weakness, as Nina considered it, she saw her way clearly to the goal she proposed to win.</p>
               <p>On their return, when the carriage came to a cross road that led to the Glades, Mrs. Hawks suddenly said:</p>
               <p>"We have time enough to call, and see how Inez really is. Speak to the driver, my dear, and tell him to turn off toward the Glades. I did think that I would not go there again, but since Inez is sick, I must see for myself what is the matter with her."</p>
               <p>The order was given, and they soon drew up in front of the desolate looking old house. Nina took Bijou in her arms, and assisted Mrs. Hawks to alight and ascend the flight of stone steps leading to the portico.</p>
               <p>The hall was deserted, but through the open door of Mr. Lopez' room they saw him in his chair, playing with Don Bobtail. The cat rubbed his glossy fur against his master's breast, put his paws upon his shoulder, and made that purring noise which indicates satisfaction and enjoyment in the feline species. When he caught sight of the visitors, he demurely perched himself upon his master's knee, and furtively eyed the poodle, though he seemed evidently on his good behavior to-day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez seemed surprised at the appearance of his visitors—he had heard the approach of the carriage, but supposed it was only returning from the usual afternoon drive to Newport.</p>
               <p>Before he could speak, Mrs. Hawks exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"There is that spotted monster again, and I know he is only watching an opportunity to pounce upon my poor Bijjer, and tear his eyes out. Cover him over with your handkerchief, Nina, and shield him in your arms."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez waved his hand, and suavely said:</p>
               <p>"I am happy to see you in my poor house, ladies, and I assure you, Eunice, that you need fear no attack on your pet from Don Bobtail to-day. He has just been asking me to apologize for his rudeness yesterday, and I hope you will forgive him for his inhospitable reception of your poodle when they last met."</p>
               <p>"Forgive him, indeed! when he scratched darling Bijjer's nose, and the poor creature has not recovered his spirits since. He—he is trembling with fear now, and I insist that your cat shall be banished from the room while I am here."</p>
               <p>With an air of mock resignation Mr. Lopez said:</p>
               <p>"Summon Dick to the rescue then, if you please, Miss Gordon. The Don is fond of him, and will go with him without resistance. I am really sorry, Eunice, that our pets are so antagonistic to each other. I am afraid that they take their cue from their respective owners, for somehow it always happens that you and I get at cross purposes when we meet."</p>
               <p>"If we do, it is not <emph>my</emph> fault. Call Dick, Nina, and tell him to remove that wretch, but don't you trust Bijjer out of your own keeping a single moment, even after he's gone. There is no knowing at what moment he may rush back and make an effort to exterminate the darling fellow."</p>
               <p>Nina hastened to obey, and Don Bobtail looking very dignified, and a little cross, was taken away in the custody of the driver. When this was accomplished, Mr. Lopez turned to his sister-in-law, and said:</p>
               <p>"You came to inquire after Inez, I suppose. After doing all that was in your power to make her miserable, you have come to see how well you have succeeded. Well, you will have the satisfaction of finding that your work is pretty well done. Inez is completely broken down; she has not<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6338-00000094"/> been able to sit up to-day, and Minturn says that she has received a severe mental shock from which she may be a long time recovering."</p>
               <p>"I declare this passes all that has gone before," cried Mrs. Hawks, in a rage, for he had spoken so loudly and distinctly, that she had perfectly understood him. "You suffered your daughter to form a marriage engagement with a man of whom you know next to nothing, and when he is found out to be unworthy of her, you coolly throw the blame on me. The man is a wretch! a male flirt! a deceiver! Inez knows this, yet she is breaking her heart over him. The more fool she, I say."</p>
               <p>With perfect coolness Mr. Lopez replied to this outburst:</p>
               <p>"The world is filled with people of that stamp, Mrs. Hawks, as <emph>you</emph> above all women should know. My daughter does not profess to be a phenomenon of wisdom, but she should have sense enough to know that the tale of a jealous rival is not always worthy of belief."</p>
               <p>He fixed his black, glittering eyes full on Nina, but without any appearance of anger, she said:</p>
               <p>"I understand you perfectly, Mr. Lopez, but all I ask of you is to suspend your judgment till your daughter had heard from her lover. I spoke only for her good; not from any feeling of bitterness on my side. Mr. Fenton is now no more to me than the merest stranger."</p>
               <p>"Then, by Heaven! you had little to do, to come here and poison my daughter's mind against as true a gentleman as lives. I won't believe a word of this nonsense, and if Inez were as wise as she ought to be, she would not either."</p>
               <p>In a resigned tone, Nina replied:</p>
               <p>"I am willing to rest under this cloud till Mr. Fenton has spoken in his own defence. If he denies what I have asserted; if he can prove that I have slandered him, I am willing to bear the burden of your most bitter anger. Till then, I entreat that you will give me credit for harboring no evil intention toward Miss Lopez in acting as I have done."</p>
               <p>With a sneer he was at no pains to conceal, he said:</p>
               <p>"You are very fair and very winning, no doubt, Miss Gordon; but I have seen women like you before to-day, and, short as our acquaintance is, I begin to see through you. I believe that while under the influence of opium I yesterday said something to you which I wish to retract to-day. Inez will need no assistance from you in the affair I mentioned, and my offer of an annuity to you for certain services is withdrawn."</p>
               <p>"So much the better, sir," was the calm response, "for I had made up my mind to reject your bribe. My dear old friend shall do with her own as pleases her best, without any interference from me. I can excuse what you have said to me to-day, for the expression of your eyes assures me that you are still under the influence of that pernicious drug."</p>
               <p>He glared on her, but Mrs. Hawks here broke in; she had vainly watched the motions of the speaker's lips to give a clue to what was passing between them, and, finding herself baffled, angrily asked:</p>
               <p>"What are you saying to each other? and why do you look as if you were ready to fight a duel?"</p>
               <p>Nina spoke close beside her ear in reply:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lopez is only complimenting me on my sharpness in bringing to light the baseness of the man who aspires to become the husband of his daughter."</p>
               <p>"By Jove! your coolness beats anything I ever saw!" exclaimed Lopez; but luckily at that moment Nora came in, bearing a message from Inez, requesting her aunt to go to her room, and an apology to Miss Gordon for declining to<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6338-00000095"/> receive her. Nina flitted from the apartment, as she had no desire to fight another battle with her ungracious host, and the elder lady rustled out after the girl.</p>
               <p>In another moment, Mrs. Hawks was standing beside the couch on which her niece reposed, and she was almost startled at the change a few hours had wrought in the fair face of one of whose beauty she was really proud.</p>
               <p>Inez was almost as deadly white as the cambric wrapper she wore; livid circles were around her eyes, with that expression of restless pain in the dark orbs themselves which proved the truth of the physician's words.</p>
               <p>She held out her hand, which was burning with fever, and, with a painful effort to smile, said:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, aunt Eunice. I am, as you see, too ill to rise, but I hope that I shall soon be better."</p>
               <p>"Don't try to talk, child, for I can't hear a word you say. Your voice seems to have gone away to nothing. It is very provoking that you should get sick just as I came to Newport; but something is always happening to vex me. I wanted you to be friends with Nina, for I have taken such a fancy to her, that I don't know but it may end in my adopting her."</p>
               <p>Inez flushed suddenly, and the expression of surprise and pain that came to her face was easily understood by her aunt, if her words were not. She was too faint to talk with one so deaf as Mrs. Hawks, and in a sort of apologetic tone, that lady went on, though she plainly saw the annoyance she was giving:</p>
               <p>"There is enough and to spare, you know, to provide for you both handsomely, if I should seriously think of such a thing. I haven't quite made up my mind, but I think it fair to tell you that such a thing is possible. My life is so solitary, and this young girl brightens it so much, that I hourly grow fonder of her. What do you think of this scheme of adopting her, eh, Inez?</p>
               <p>"My brain is too confused to think clearly of anything, aunt. But if you wish to adopt Miss Gordon, of course you will do it without reference to what I may think."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks did not catch the meaning of her words, but she saw from the face of her niece that she did not receive this unlooked-for announcement without a pang, and she went on:</p>
               <p>"I did not expect that you would like it, Inez, but what am I to do? You won't leave your father to come to me, and I must have something to love. Yes, child, it is so, and you need not look so much amazed. I am a human creature whose heart isn't quite dead yet, and I find it pleasant to have always near me a young girl who, I am sure, is becoming sincerely attached to me for my own sake."</p>
               <p>"Poor aunt," sighed Inez, "cut off from nearly all social enjoyment, as she is, no wonder that she pins her faith to that captivating girl, who does all she can to recommend herself to her. I see that she has already rivalled me, but I won't sit up in judgment on her, though I am afraid that self-interest is the basis of all Miss Gordon's pretended affection for this poor, deceived old woman."</p>
               <p>She made an effort to raise her voice, and said:</p>
               <p>"You are quite right, Aunt Eunice. I cannot leave my father. My first duty is to him, and my heart also prompts me to remain with him. If this young lady can fill the vacancy in your life I shall be glad to know that you have attached yourself to her. She seems a brilliant and fascinating creature."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you don't know half her witching ways. She is the best mimic you ever saw, and it would half kill you with laughing to see her take off that fat, pompous Mrs. Bates, who tries to be a fine lady without exactly knowing what is expected of her in that character. It is the richest thing I ever saw. Mrs. Bates is a most absurd person, and Nina can hit off her peculiarities to the life."</p>
               <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6338-00000096"/>
               <p>"Was it not from her that Miss Gordon received her recommendation to you, Aunt?" asked Inez, significantly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! well—yes; but it was only on account of her intimacy with the daughter. She is not bound to spare Mamma Bates, you know, because she is attached to Kitty. She has seen that young swell of a brother, too, and it is wonderful with what precision she copied the Broadway exquisite. I declare, her mimicry is better than any farce I ever saw."</p>
               <p>Inez wondered if Mrs. Hawks had no fear that the plastic powers of her attractive companion might be brought into requisition to amuse others at her expense, as she had not scrupled to caricature the friends who had certainly been kind to her; but she feared that her aunt might misinterpret her motives if she pointed out this want of principle in Miss Gordon, and she forbore saying anything more on the subject.</p>
               <p>When the theme of Nina's fascinations was exhausted, the visitor arose to depart. She took the hand of Inez in her own, and said:</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, child; don't be fretting your heart out about a man that isn't worthy of a thought. I know very well what has brought you down so suddenly, but you'll come round soon and find a lover as clever as Godfrey Fenton to console you for his treachery. There—you need not flush up so, and look so keen out of your great black eyes at me. I am only talking common sense, as you will live to find out yet."</p>
               <p>She dropped the hot hand, sailed out of the room, and announced to Mr. Lopez her intention to depart immediately.</p>
               <p>Nina had gone out on the portico, where she was trying to establish a truce between the cat and dog. Don Bobtail walked around and around her, eyeing the poodle she held in her arms with benignant forbearance, but all the girl's blandishments could not coax him to rub his soft fur against her dress, and purr as he was accustomed to do around his master.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks paused in her exit to say:</p>
               <p>"Inez is very feverish. I think you had better send for my physician, for I have very little faith in the homeopathic doctor you employ."</p>
               <p>"And let her be poisoned and drugged to death, I suppose," growled the paralytic. "We all have to die some time, but I don't intend to have my fate nor that of my daughter hastened by calomel and quinine, I can tell you. No such horrid doses shall be given to Inez with my consent. She is doing very well. I had my chair wheeled into her room to-day and sat with her some time. I am perfectly satisfied with the treatment she is under."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are easily satisfied, is all I have to say; but Inez is your child, and I have no right to interfere about her, if she is my niece. I will bid you good-bye now, though, if you were better tempered, I should be sorry to leave you alone, and I would offer to stop and play a game of chess with you."</p>
               <p>"Pray excuse me, ma'am; we should both insist on beating, and the one that had to surrender would be sure to get in a towering passion, so we had better let the chess alone. I have become quite literary in my tastes of late and read a great deal. And that reminds me of something I wish to say to you. The library at Oakland is still as your father left it at his death, I believe."</p>
               <p>"Yes, the books have been taken care of by the people who occupy a portion of the house. They are paid a small sum every year to dust and air them, but I never go near the place myself. Do you want any books brought from there?"</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6338-00000097"/>
               <p>"If you will be so kind as to give me an order for a few, I shall be very much obliged to you. Mr. Horton had some rare works which are beyond my purse, but I should like very much to read several of them."</p>
               <p>"You are welcome to as much of the learned rubbish as you choose to send for. I will give you an order on Wilkins to allow your messenger to take away as many volumes has you may desire. Do you wish me to write it now?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, if you please. I cannot tell you how much indebted I am to you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's a mere trifle, so you need not be so very grateful. The library is of little value to me, and I only keep it together because it was collected by my father. I have not much fondness for books at any rate, and none certainly for the learned tomes he delighted in accumulating."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez opened a portfolio that lay on the table beside him, dipped a pen in the ink, and presented it to Mrs. Hawks. In a few moments the order was written on which, he firmly believed, so much depended. He put it safely away in his pocket-book and briefly said:</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Eunice, I shall remember this kindness, and I hope yet to show you what a grateful return I shall make for it."</p>
               <p>He showed the whole of his white teeth when he smiled, and, although she did not understand him, Mrs. Hawks felt that there was some hidden meaning behind his words. What it was she did not pause to consider, but went out to her carriage feeling glad to get away from the sombre house and its afflicted inmates.</p>
               <p>On their way home Nina amused her by giving such a laughable travestie of her brother-in-law's manner as was marvellous to behold. By what magic power she made her small teeth assume the menacing appearance of those of Mr. Lopez, Mrs. Hawks could not understand, but she enjoyed the effect produced with considerable zest.</p>
               <p>The next best thing to quarrelling with her obnoxious brother-in-law, was having him made ridiculous by the unscrupulous young creature who spared neither age nor infirmity in her eager search after food for her satirical talent.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Perkins heard that her mistress had visited the Glades a second time without taking her along, her wrath waxed warm again; but Nina smoothed down her ruffled feelings, and brought her into good humor by a few judicious words of flattery, and a made-up message purporting to come from Mr. Lopez and his daughter, to the effect that she would be expected on the following day to visit her nurseling.</p>
               <p>Nina took good care that the waiting woman was sent next day in place of herself to inquire how Inez had passed the night.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">NINA DECLARES HERSELF AN HEIRESS.</head>
               <p>THE Bates family arrived at Newport, and took possession of the handsome suite of apartments which had been secured for them. They were in a less quiet portion of the house than the rooms of Mrs. Hawks, but Nina soon found her way to them with ease, and became almost as much at home in them as in her own chamber.</p>
               <p>Her trunks came with Kitty's, and a bribe to the keeper of a linen closet, which opened from Nina's room on one side, and into one of the principal corridors on the other, afforded her egress from her apartment without the knowledge of Mrs. Hawks, or her waiting woman.</p>
               <p>Then commenced the life for which she had so eagerly pined, and she proved that her exuberant vitality was equal<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6338-00000098"/> to the double strain she imposed upon it. From eleven in the morning till ten at night, Nina devoted herself to her patroness, with such increasing effect, that Mrs. Hawks became almost dotingly fond of her. Dismissed for the night, she sped at once to Kitty's apartment, and with the assistance of her friend's maid, completed a rapid and brilliant toilette. By eleven she was ready to join the throng of gay revellers in the ball room, and chaperoned by the passive Mrs. Bates, she and Kitty made their appearance, usually escorted by some gentleman of their New York set.</p>
               <p>Among her other accomplishments, Nina had been taught to dance with rare grace and skill, and her fine appearance, quick <unclear>repartee,</unclear> and daring disregard of conventionalities, soon rendered her a marked person among such pretty nonentities as <emph>she</emph> called them, who were "content to dwell in decencies forever."</p>
               <p>She was not guilty of anything that was glaringly improper, but she did as she pleased, and her wild and wilful spirits often led her beyond the bounds of prudence.</p>
               <p>As Miss Gordon's antecedents were entirely unknown, and she appeared among a set of entirely new aspirants to fashionable notoriety, it was assumed that she was rich, and Kitty did everything in her power to further the delusion, without actually telling falsehoods on the subject.</p>
               <p>Why the brilliant belle was never visible except at night was accounted for by her devotion to an afflicted friend, who required all her attention during the day; and touching stories were related of her fondness for her adopted mother, for Nina chose now to consider herself as the daughter of the poor dupe she was so skillfully bending to her own purposes.</p>
               <p>These went far toward excusing the levity of her conduct in public, for it was said that so impulsive and warm hearted a creature could scarcely be expected to bring her actions down to the common test of prudence required from other girls of her age. Such a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">rara avis</foreign> was not to be judged by common rules, so Miss Gordon was voted charming, piquant, irresistible, even by many of her own sex.</p>
               <p>In no other country in the world could such a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">role</foreign> have been played, as that which was now successfully sustained by Nina Gordon, for in no other would such freedom be allowed to a young unmarried woman.</p>
               <p>She became the belle of the season, and when she made her appearance in the ball room, other shrines were deserted for this new divinity who queened it right royally over her vassals. Kitty was charmed with the success she had predicted, and Mrs. Bates looked on in displeased amazement. She was at a loss to understand how this obscure and penniless girl had achieved such a triumph, while her own daughter, who was known to be an heiress, was a mere foil beside her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates was annoyed at seeing Kitty so constantly eclipsed, and she hinted to that young lady the expediency of dropping Miss Gordon as an inconvenient appendage to their party, as Kitty had no chance to win admiration while this fantastic and enchanting creature was always with her to cast her in the shade.</p>
               <p>To this Kitty vehemently replied:</p>
               <p>"I hope that I do not rightly understand you, mamma. I would not give Nina up for all the beaux at Newport. I don't wish to be admired. Young men talk more to me now, and ask me to dance oftener than I care about. I'll tell you one thing, ma, and that is, that if it wasn't for Nina we should never have made our way into as good a set as we have got into here. Money can't do everything, even in a democratic country like ours, and my friend's grace and elegance have done more for us here, than all my father's wealth could accomplish. That aristocratic Mrs.<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6338-00000099"/> Legrand, who thinks herself the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">crême de la crême,</foreign> takes a deep interest in Nina, and she has actually invited her to visit her next winter. You would not consent to ask her again to our house, and she now has a more fashionable one open to her, if she chooses to accept the invitation given her."</p>
               <p>"Yes—Mrs. Legrand likes to have fascinating young girls about her to attract gentlemen to her house. She is fond of gay society, and cannot hope to bring it around her by her own charms, so she secures the assistance of younger and fairer women. That is the secret of her interest in Miss Gordon."</p>
               <p>"It doesn't matter to us what the source of it is; it is sufficient that an autocrat of fashion has placed the stamp of her approbation upon Nina. Do not offer to snub the dear girl, ma, because I am sure that you will see her a leader in New York society before another year is gone."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates stared, and in a vexed tone said:</p>
               <p>"What nonsense you talk, Kitty. If the girl has made a sensation at a watering place like this, it does not follow that rich boobies are so plenty as to be picked up by a penniless girl who knows nothing of her own origin. When it comes to marriage, the truth must be told, and then the lover would find good cause to back out. Of course when he finds out that she has neither family, nor fortune, he'll not do it."</p>
               <p>"I think there are few men who would attempt such a course with Nina Gordon. She is too lovely and attractive in herself to be deserted because she knows nothing of her family. As to the fortune, I fancy it will not be wanting, for Mrs. Hawks has taken such a fancy to her that she has declared her intention to adopt her, and make a handsome provision for her. She is very rich, and of course the old lady will give Nina at least a hundred thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"Good gracious! can this be true? It is evident that Miss Gordon knows how to play her own game, and I shouldn't wonder if we were all used by her merely as counters. I am afraid that she is a dangerous person, but you are so infatuated with her that it is useless for me to speak of getting rid of her, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, mamma, you wound me deeply when you speak in such terms of my dearest and best friend. You are unjust to Nina because she is prettier, and more admired than I am, but I enjoy her success; I had rather see her triumph than do so myself. I never wished to be a belle, nor has nature bestowed on me the requisites for that butterfly state of existence. 'Warranted to wear,' is stamped on me, so you must make the best of me as I am."</p>
               <p>With a sudden access of affection, Mrs. Bates said:</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't give you just as you are for fifty such girls as Nina Gordon. When the butterfly wings are folded away, all that is charming in her will be gone; but you are and always will be my own good and true child. I won't vex you any more about your friend, though I can't approve of many things she does. She doesn't seem to mind my opinion any more than if I was a mere nonentity, although I occupy the responsible position of her chaperon."</p>
               <p>"Oh, never do you mind that, you dear, sensible, good mamma. Nina is not like other girls and must not be judged by common rules, but I am certain that she has the deepest respect for you. Tell me now, please, when papa expects to return to Newport."</p>
               <p>"Not until the season is nearly over. He was tired to death by the few days I persuaded him to remain when we first came over, and I do not think he will try it again till he is forced to come after us. Are you anxious for him to return?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, by no means. I only asked because Adolphus<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6338-00000100"/> has written to me to say that he will be at the hop to-night, and I thought a meeting here between him and pa might be rather awkward after he was ordered to Nahant, to keep him out of the way of Nina's fascinations."</p>
               <p>"My son coming here in spite of his father's prohibition!" exclaimed Mrs. Bates, in a tragic tone. "Kitty, you know that such a course will only bring Dolly into disgrace with Mr. Bates. You must have known before of his intention, and I have the pain of discovering that you have both been conspiring to deceive your parents."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates shed a few tears, and Kitty's conscience loudly accused her; but she thought the end justified the means, and she hastened to soothe her mother's emotions as far as lay in her power. She ended by saying:</p>
               <p>"If my brother should fall in love with Nina, papa will not object to her for a daughter-in-law when he knows that she is sure of a handsome portion from Mrs. Hawks. <emph>He</emph> can't be very particular on the score of family, and she looks as if she were a Princess Royal."</p>
               <p>"All that may be true enough, Kitty, but if she comes among us she'll expect to rule us. I know she will do it too, for she'll twist your pa and Dolly around her fingers till I shall find myself a nobody in my own house. I wish I had never consented to bring her out here or to allow her to enter my home."</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma," said Kitty, persuasively, "what bugaboo are you conjuring up to frighten yourself with? You know very well that, if Dolly marries, he will have a home of his own; his wife will not interfere with you in any way; and if he should be so fortunate as to win Nina, I am sure she will be the most dutiful of daughters to you."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates sighed, and, wiping her eyes, replied:</p>
               <p>"You are so infatuated with Miss Gordon that you can see nothing wrong in her. Now, what do you think of her conduct in our private parlor, the other night, when she mimicked the poor old epileptic creature she wheedles every day into believing that she is very fond of her? After witnessing that, I am not sure she has not tried her hand on some of us."</p>
               <p>"No, no; <emph>we</emph> are sacred to her, because we are her chosen friends. You see that makes all the difference in the world. And then Nina only did it to make pa laugh when he was yawning so dreadfully, and saying that he couldn't find anything to amuse him."</p>
               <p>"So your friend entertained him at the expense of the woman whose bread she eats, and who is expected to leave her a good fortune when she dies. It is not right, Kitty; and, if Miss Gordon is your second self, I must say so."</p>
               <p>"Well, it was very droll, at any rate," said Kitty, laughing at the recollection of the scene, "and Mrs. Hawks will not be the worse for what she will never know. It cannot hurt her in any way to have her peculiarities mimicked, but how Nina contrives to give her eyes the strange glare of the old lady's I can't comprehend. She would make an unrivaled actress."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I wish with all my heart that she had elected to go on the stage in place of coming among quiet people to upset all their plans. Your pa and I had settled that Adolphus should marry Ada Pierre."</p>
               <p>"What, that vulgar, coarse-looking girl whose father made a fortune out of medicated lozenges and corn plaster? Oh, mamma, haven't we money enough of our own without Dolly making such a match as that? He wouldn't look at Ada Pierre if she was dressed in bank-notes."</p>
               <p>"I don't suppose he would if she wore anything as dingy as the most of them are; but, if they were turned into point-lace and diamonds, perhaps he would not be so fastidious. We are not so rich as the world believes, Kitty,<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6338-00000101"/> and from some things that fell from your pa when he was here, I'm afraid he's expecting a crisis or something of that sort, that will strain his credit to the utmost. That was one reason why he was so anxious to get back to New York. But you are not to breathe a word of this for the world!"</p>
               <p>Kitty looked aghast, and she huskily replied:</p>
               <p>"Of course I shall say nothing about it, but I wish you had not told me just now."</p>
               <p>"I thought it best to tell you; and, now that we are talking in confidence, I may as well say to you that, if you can like Tom Lorimer well enough to accept him, you had better do so out of hand before anything can happen. His money might help your father out of his difficulties."</p>
               <p>Kitty became pale, and then red. After an agitated pause, she said:</p>
               <p>"I hope that you are mistaken, ma, about papa's need of such assistance. But, even if you are not, I cannot say Yes to Mr. Lorimer, for I have already refused him."</p>
               <p>"Refused him! and for what reason, pray?"</p>
               <p>"I can give you two very good ones; one is that I do not love him, and the other is that I like somebody else infinitely better."</p>
               <p>"I know who you mean very well, Kitty; but you will never be permitted to throw yourself away on Albert Tompkins, and if you had any spirit you would not wish it yourself. A poor clerk, with nothing but his salary! a magnificent match would that be for you, indeed. And you have actually refused Mr. Lorimer without even saying a word to your father or me about it, when you knew, too, that our hearts are set on the match. Upon my word, the young girls of this generation are too much for me. You—<emph>you</emph> that I thought an affectionate and dutiful daughter—have gone and ruined your own prospects by refusing the best offer you will ever have! It is more than I can bear."</p>
               <p>And Mrs. Bates relapsed into tears.</p>
               <p>Kitty was much excited, but she controlled her agitation and deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"Dear mamma, don't blame me too severely; but what could I do but refuse him? Mr. Lorimer is such a goose that he is always doing some absurd thing to make himself talked of. He never has anything more striking to say than some comment on the weather, or the last quadrille; and although I'm not very bright myself, I can see his deficiencies. I don't think poor Tom has an idea above a good-fitting suit of clothes, or a stylish necktie. Oh! no, ma, I am too sensible to his defects to accept him as a husband. I am in no hurry to get married, and I hope that pa will not really need such assistance as you hinted at just now from anybody. I could not marry Mr. Lorimer under false pretenses any way, and if he had suspected pa's difficulties I hardly think he would have asked me."</p>
               <p>"But he did ask you, and you should have consulted with me before refusing him. As to false pretenses, isn't your friend a bundle of them? Isn't she letting people suppose that she is related to Mrs. Hawks, and the heiress to all her fortune? Why you should insist that I shall not speak the truth about her, when you are so particular about yourself, I cannot understand."</p>
               <p>"Nina and I are so differently situated, mamma, that the same reasoning will not apply to both of us. Besides, she can bring to her husband gifts of person and mind that I can lay no claim to. She can induce him to forget any deceit through which he was won, but I could never do that. I am but a homespun piece of furniture, and all the fine varnish you tried to put on me has only brought out the true grain more conspicuously. I know that I am neither handsome nor clever; but I am above envying Nina because she is both. I love her with all my heart, if she<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6338-00000102"/> does reign a queen where I am nothing but a rich man's daughter."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid that you'll not be the last much longer, unless you or Dolly come to the rescue. <emph>His</emph> means are tied up with his father's, and unless he marries a girl with money, and that pretty soon too, I am really afraid that Bates &amp; Son will never be able to stand the run your papa said would be sure to be made on the house whenever that horrid crisis comes. He told me about it, that I might understand the necessity of urging you to accept Mr. Lorimer."</p>
               <p>"Mamma," said Kitty, with emphasis, "if I was in danger of starving, I hardly think that I could save myself from it by becoming the wife of poor Tom. But we are in no such exigency yet. Papa will weather the storm, as he has others before it, I dare say; Dolly shall win Nina, and the fortune Mrs. Hawks will give her as her dower will build up the credit of the firm again. I hardly think she will refuse <emph>my</emph> brother; but if she should, there is still Ada Pierre as a last resort. I remember that she set her cap at Dolly last winter; but he declared that the thought of the lozenges gave him bronchitis, and the corn plaster crippled him through his sympathy for those who were simple enough to believe in its efficacy. It will be time enough to think of Miss Pierre when other chances are worthless. But if Dolly chooses to sell himself for money, I declare I won't."</p>
               <p>"Not even to save your pa from ruin?" asked Mrs. Bates, with an attempt at the pathetic. "Oh, Kitty, I believed you so devoted to him that you would do anything to please him."</p>
               <p>"I do love the dear old darling with all my heart, but I can't marry a dunce to save his credit. Besides, if Mr. Lorimer had the faintest suspicion of what you have just told me, he would withdraw himself. I do not think that his devotion would stand such a test as the loss of my supposed fortune."</p>
               <p>"I really believe, Kitty, that you think your only attractions lie in your money. Why should not Mr. Lorimer love you for yourself?"</p>
               <p>Kitty laughed a little bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Tom likes me well enough in his feeble way, I dare say, but such love as his could never satisfy me, mamma, humble as my pretensions are. Why should I <emph>not</emph> suppose that my reputed fortune is the chief attraction to the most of my adorers, when I see scores of girls at this very place, far more attractive than I am, who are scarcely looked at because they are known to have no expectations. But pray let us end this discussion, ma, for Dolly will be here very soon, now, and I must hurry through my evening toilette to have a good talk with him before Nina joins us."</p>
               <p>Kitty arose to leave the room, but Mrs. Bates stopped her and impressively said:</p>
               <p>"You must not hint to your brother what I have told you. If it becomes necessary for him to be informed of the state of your father's business affairs, he will tell Adolphus himself."</p>
               <p>Kitty reflected a moment, and then replied:</p>
               <p>"Of course I shall have no right to betray to my brother what you have said to me, unless I have your permission to do so. But as his whole fortune is locked up in the business, I do not think it fair to keep him in the dark as to what may possibly happen."</p>
               <p>With an alarmed look, Mrs. Bates exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You always jump to such absurd conclusions, Kitty. Things are by no means so desperate with us as to make us put on sackcloth and ashes, and begin to bewail our misfortunes. Your father is a man of infinite business tact, and he will doubtless find means to stave off the worst till<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6338-00000103"/> Adolphus can secure a wife with a good fortune. A hundred thousand dollars will, I dare say, make all square again, and you said that Miss Gordon is to get as much as that when Mrs. Hawks dies."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma, you misunderstood me. I did not say that she would get as much as that, but spoke of that sum as no more than an adequate provision for an adopted daughter. But even if she gives her that, and Nina and my brother should like each other well enough to marry, it would not be right to take the whole of her fortune to prop up the credit of a tottering house; some portion of it should be secured to herself."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Dolly will find it necessary to take Miss Pierre, then. He understands what a commercial crisis is, and I am sure he will consent to do what is necessary to sustain the credit of the firm. The daughter of the lozenge man will have three times as much as you hope Mrs. Hawks will bestow on your friend, and if Dolly values my opinion he will prefer her to Miss Gordon. She is not so attractive, but she will make him a far better wife."</p>
               <p>Kitty had heard quite enough, and she hastily left the room, believing in her heart that her mother had darkened the clouds that threatened their prosperity, in the forlorn hope that she would be wrought on to think better of her rejection of Mr. Lorimer's proposal, and by such feminine wiles as young ladies know how to use toward men of his stamp, recall him to his allegiance.</p>
               <p>But Miss Bates had no such intention; she had spoken her ultimatum, and meant to stand by it, let what might happen to Bates &amp; Son; even if the worst came, her father would surely be able to save enough from the wreck of his fortune to enable his small family to live in comfort, and Kitty felt that she would not grieve much over a catastrophe that lessened the distance between herself and the obnoxious clerk who had won her childish heart and was still first in that of the young girl.</p>
               <p>She cast the temporary cloud aside with the facility of youth, and hastened to prepare herself to receive her brother. Before her toilette was completed, Nina came in radiant with triumph.</p>
               <p>She spoke in French to her friend, that the attendant might not understand her.</p>
               <p>"Dear Kitty, as you are the best friend I have in the world, I must tell you what great good fortune has come to me. You know that Mrs. Hawks gets steadily worse, and every spasm she has is more dangerous than the last. Poor old lady, she can't last much longer, and she begins to realize her condition herself. Something she heard yesterday put her in a terrible passion with her niece, and when I tell you what she did under the influence of her anger, you will hardly believe me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes I will, if it is what I so ardently wish. She has made her will and given half of her money to you."</p>
               <p>"Half!—oh, no—<emph>that</emph> would not satisfy her spite against Miss Lopez, for there would still be enough left to make her rich. The old lady has actually made her will in my favor, bequeathing me the <emph>whole</emph> of her estate, burdened with an annuity of a thousand a year to her niece. The document is signed, sealed, and in the hands of her lawyer."</p>
               <p>Kitty danced a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pas seul,</foreign> kissed her friend enthusiastically, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"This is glorious news indeed; but it is no more than you deserve. Such a gem as you are should have a rich setting, and Mrs. Hawks is a most sensible woman to furnish it. I must go in, to-morrow, and play the agreeable to her for your dear sake. But in your prosperity, Nina dear, don't forget that ma and I afforded you the opportunity to win this brilliant fortune; though of course your<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6338-00000104"/> own sweetness and lovability enabled you to rival the niece."</p>
               <p>Nina returned the caresses lavished on her, and presently said:</p>
               <p>"Thus far I have carried everything before me, but Mrs. Hawks is capricious and easily offended, and I cannot be too careful to keep her in a good humor with me. If she suspected me of knowing the contents of her will, she would be quite capable of destroying it."</p>
               <p>"She did not tell you herself, then? How came you to know what she has done for you, for the lawyer would not dare to betray such a confidence."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>listened,</emph>" said Nina, without the slightest hesitation. "But then I could not very well avoid it, for like many other deaf persons, Mrs. Hawks does not know how to modulate her voice. When the lawyer came she sent her maid away to the Glades, and told me to remain in my room within call if she should need me. To tell the truth, Kitty, I did not close the door of communication as perfectly as she might have wished, for I was afraid she might have one of her attacks and I should not be able to get to her in time.</p>
               <p>"As it happened, nothing of the kind occurred, and in two hours' time the lawyer had finished drawing up the will, and when Mrs. Perkins came back she and the carriage driver were called in to witness the old lady's signature. Little does the waiting woman suspect that the document she was so anxious to have executed cuts off Inez Lopez with a pittance, and endows me with the fortune of her grandfather. Oh, dear! how shall I ever tone my spirits down to a respectable level, when I am buoyed up by such brilliant dreams of the future."</p>
               <p>She sprang up, danced, laughed, and went on like a mad creature, while Betty the maid looked on in bewilderment as she laid out the articles needed for Nina's evening toilette. She did not understand a word that had passed between the two girls, but she saw that something had elated the usually gay spirits of the young lady, and the girl was pleased, for Nina had been kind and liberal toward her.</p>
               <p>Kitty laughingly responded:</p>
               <p>"Think of the responsibilities so soon to devolve on you, and that will sober you, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">mà chere.</foreign> Mrs. Hawks should not leave her good work half done; she should be polite enough to make her exit without delay, that you may come into the enjoyment of your fortune. But I have been so much occupied with your good news that I have not told you mine. My brother joins us to-night, and the remembrance of your fair face draws him hither in spite of pa's prohibition. You will be kind to Dolly for my sake, Nina?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, darling; and for his own too, for I shall not readily forget that Mr. Bates admired me in my most lowly estate. Since he is coming, I must make myself as charming as possible, so I will excuse you while Betty does her devoir as deftly by me as she has done it by you. Your dress is really very becoming, and those rubies suit your style admirably. I cannot afford jewels yet awhile, but wait and see what diamonds, what pearls, what laces I will have when I possess twenty thousand a year."</p>
               <p>"You shall have all those things, and true hearts that love you well besides, Nina dear. I won't detain you any longer, and I suppose I am not to tell what you have confided to me."</p>
               <p>"Not for the world! That might ruin me. Mrs. Hawks thinks I am in profound ignorance of her intentions, and perfectly disinterested, so her faith in me must not be disturbed. I really am very fond of her, and very much obliged to her, I am sure."</p>
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6338-00000105"/>
               <p>Blind to the faul of one she so loved and trusted, Kitty, in spite of her better judgment and higher ideas of honor, could see nothing very wrong in the means by which Nina had possessed herself of what was designed to be concealed from her.</p>
               <p>She went into her mother's private parlor, where she found her brother had been for the last half hour, which interval of time he had improved by talking over Mrs. Bates, and making his peace with her for breaking the commands laid on him by his father.</p>
               <p>Miss Pierre was at Nahant, and when Kitty came in he was describing in a most ludicrous manner the persecutions he had endured from her. After greeting her, he went on in his fashionable drawl:</p>
               <p>"The Pierre is too storming—she talks loud—she laughs too much, and says sharp things. I wouldn't mind all that, if she was only pretty. But she is tall and raw-boned, with a sallow complexion and little black eyes that can snap and sparkle in a rather spirited way. But there is no end to her money, and the lozenges and corn-plaster still sell as widely as ever. Heigh ho! I wish I could put money out of the question, when I marry, but the governor has written me such a rigmarole as has almost frightened me into believing that I must get a pier, to support our house. Ha! ha! what do you think of that now? The old gentleman is getting mercenary, I am afraid!"</p>
               <p>"What has your father been saying to you, Dolly?" asked Mrs. Bates, apprehensively. "If he appealed to you in such a way, something must be very wrong about the business."</p>
               <p>"Oh bother, it is only his way to frighten me into taking a rich wife. He knows that girl has thrown herself and her thousands at my head, and my father wishes to furnish further knock down arguments to bring me to her feet. But it won't do. I've effected my escape now, and I mean to use my freedom. I say, Kitty, when am I to see that fair friend of yours? I've seen two or three men of our set since I got here to-night, and they all seem to have their heads turned by her. She must be a stunner; but how is it that the fellows all speak of her as an heiress when you and I know that she is as poor as a church mouse?"</p>
               <p>With great deliberation, Kitty replied:</p>
               <p>"Miss Gordon is the lady you refer to, I suppose. She has been adopted by the rich old lady mamma placed her with, and I think it almost certain that she will provide for her very handsomely."</p>
               <p>"What! old Hawks! why she must have nearly half a a million. Of course, the girl who takes the place of a daughter must get a large slice from it; but then the deuce of it is, the old woman may be a long time taking her ticket-of-leave; and while she's on the carpet the fortune isn't sure. Such an old frump may change her mind a dozen times a week; besides, she has relations to look sharply after her."</p>
               <p>"I don't think they trouble themselves about her much. Her brother-in-law is paralyzed, and cannot leave his own home, and his daughter stays with him nearly all the time. I have never met with her in Mrs. Hawks' room since we came here, but I believe she is sick herself is the reason."</p>
               <p>"Is she young and pretty?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite young; and Nina says she is remarkably handsome."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible that one girl declares another one handsome! Such a phenomenon as that should be duly chronicled, I declare. Pray make me acquainted with this generous young demoiselle as soon as may be, for she must be a unique specimen of her sex."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates here arose, and resignedly said:</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6338-00000106"/>
               <p>"You and Kitty will have everything your own way, but as I do not care to witness a meeting that may lead to disastrous results to my family, I will go to my own room."</p>
               <p>Young Bates looked after her in some surprise, and asked:</p>
               <p>"What does that mean? Does she know that I have already seen your fair friend, and fallen half in love with her?"</p>
               <p>"No, I have not betrayed you; but mamma has taken a pique toward poor Nina, because she attracts more attention than I do. She will get over it when you present my friend to her as your future wife. Never mind the Pierre, Dolly; follow the dictates of your own heart, and you will get as much money as you will need with the wife of your choice."</p>
               <p>"I only wish you were quite sure of that, for to tell you the truth, Kitty, I've spent a great deal, and ready money is what I must have for my own uses, as well as for the lumbering old concern down yonder, in which I verily believe the soul of my father is bound up. He hinted so many dreary possibilities in his last letter, that I came near yielding to the dark glances of those lozenge-shaped eyes, but unluckily her skin is the color of the corn plaster, so I turned away, and spoke no word that could commit me."</p>
               <p>"How can you be so absurd, Dolly? Don't think any more of Ada Pierre? I can't tell you why, but I am almost convinced that Nina will have almost as good a fortune as hers. I may at least tell you that the poor old lady who will leave it to her can't live much longer. She has lately had many violent spasms, and her physician has said that she will never leave here alive. But you are to act as if you knew nothing of this. Nina must believe you entirely disinterested, if you hope for a chance of success with her."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable!</foreign> I haven't made up my mind to take either of them yet. But we shall see what time will bring forth."</p>
               <p>There was a slight rustling sound near the door; it unclosed, and a bright vision flitted in.</p>
               <p>Nina stood before him in a bewitching evening dress, made of some light shining material which looked like flakes of gathering foam looped up with fairy-like flowers. Camelias were in her hair and on her breast, but not a jewel gleamed about her. She could not afford the most expensive, and, therefore, repudiated them all. Besides, with her freshness, she knew that flowers were more becoming than any other adornment she could select.</p>
               <p>The marble-like whiteness of her perfectly turned arms and shoulders seemed to rival that of her flowing drapery, and the bright, expressive face filled with triumphant light, was a new revelation of beauty to the Broadway exquisite.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates had not hitherto cared much for very fair women, but this one was unique. White, soft, and well-rounded as all her proportions were, she had not a particle of the lymphatic temperament in her.</p>
               <p>He saw before him a creature of will, pride, fire, and God knows what beside; but enough to bewilder much stronger brains than those possessed by the young New Yorker. Nina had overheard his closing words to his sister, and in her soul she vowed that not with him should rest the choice. His heart should be laid at her feet, and then——. Well, then she would make up her mind what use she could have for it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">INEZ PREPARES FOR A JOURNEY.</head>
               <p>INEZ arose from her sick bed and again moved about the gloomy old house, ministering to her father's wants with a patient composure which proved how bitter the struggle had been—how great the triumph won over her own weakness.</p>
               <p>She would gladly have lain in that darkened chamber till death itself came to her relief, but the thought how lonely and helpless her father would be without her afforded the stimulus she needed, and for his sake she roused herself from the indulgence of selfish sorrow.</p>
               <p>Inez resumed the monotonous round of her old life, but she had neither spirit nor strength to visit her aunt. Mrs. Hawks came to the Glades no more, but contented herself with sending her maid to inquire daily into the condition of her niece's health.</p>
               <p>The communications which passed between Mr. Lopez and this faithful guardian of his daughter's interests, convinced that gentleman that Nina Gordon was deeply to be dreaded. He felt assured that she was using all her fascinations to obtain power over Mrs. Hawks, which was to be used solely for her own benefit, and he impatiently waited till Inez had regained her strength sufficiently to undertake the enterprise on which he firmly believed so much depended.</p>
               <p>No reply had been received from Godfrey Fenton, and the poor girl had given up all hope of hearing from him again. He evidently could not defend himself, and therefore thought silence the best resource. Such was the final decision of Inez, but her father insisted that her last letter had never reached him, or he would at once have flown on the wings of love to her side, to prove to her how sincere was his devotion, how false the accusations against him.</p>
               <p>She listened to his arguments quietly, but they failed to convince her, though Mr. Lopez flattered himself that he was keeping alive the flame of hope in her sad heart.</p>
               <p>One evening about ten days after her convalescence, they sat together in the gathering twilight, and after a brief silence Mr. Lopez suddenly asked:</p>
               <p>"Are you strong enough to undertake that journey to Oakland now, Inez? I have thought of it every day and every hour since you have been ill. I have dreamed the same thing more vividly even than before, and your mother asked—'Why does not Inez go before it is too late?'"</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, do you really place so much faith in a dream as to wish me to go to Oakland on such a quest as that? I cherished the hope that you had given up the idea as too baseless to be acted on."</p>
               <p>In an irritated tone her father replied:</p>
               <p>"I can't imagine why you should think that I would give it up. Dreams in all ages have been sent as warnings and were not disregarded. Was not one sent to the wise men of the East on the grandest occasion in the history of the world? Scattered through sacred and profane chronicles we find them, and how or why they come to men, has baffled the wisest philosophers. I don't pretend to account for what more learned men have failed to do, but I place implicit faith in the vision that has been so vividly impressed upon my own mind. If nothing is meant by it, I scarcely think it would so often have been repeated. You must go, child, for I am sure that your whole future is at stake. I have reason to believe that your aunt will be silly enough to give her whole fortune to the unprincipled young flatterer she has picked up and brought with her to Newport. From what Jane Perkins tells me, the girl is having everything her own way."</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6338-00000108"/>
               <p>"But, papa, did not Jane also tell you that there is an understanding between herself and Miss Gordon that she is to use her influence to have a will executed in my favor? I told Mrs. Perkins that such a compact was ill-advised and might injure in place of serving me, but she would not listen to me. If my aunt dies intestate, I shall inherit enough for every rational purpose, even if a portion of the estate should be claimed by her husband's family. I entreated Jane to leave my aunt to act as she pleased about the will, for she has always shewn so marked an aversion to making one, that I feared any hint on the subject would offend her. My reasoning failed to convince her, so I suffered things to take their own course. It does not matter much now; I shall have enough to live on, and that is all I shall require."</p>
               <p>"I don't know which is the greatest fool, you or Mrs. Perkins," exclaimed Lopez, in a rage. "Between you, you are enough to drive a man mad. <emph>She</emph> goes and trusts that young serpent with power that is to work your ruin; and <emph>you</emph> talk in this lachrymose manner about enough to live on from your own family inheritance, when it is in danger of going to a stranger. That girl shall not have it, in spite of all her arts; and poor-spirited as you are, you shall yet snatch it from her, whether you wish it or not. You are strong enough to travel, and you shall set out for Oakland to-morrow morning, and bring me back the books of which I gave you a list. I really want the works I intend to send for, though I should have done without them, but for the ulterior object I have in view. I have sufficiently explained to you what you have to do, so I shall not repeat my instructions. I hope you fully understand me, Inez?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa," was the faint response. "I will make an effort to do all that you require of me, but I am still very weak."</p>
               <p>"Weak, are you? Well, well, change of air and exercise are the best remedies for that; you will feel like a different person when you come back, especially if you bring new life to me in the shape of the document which is to secure to you the bulk of your grandfather's fortune."</p>
               <p>Inez sighed softly, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I hope so, papa. But explain to me how I am to go alone on this journey. It seems a formidable undertaking to an inexperienced traveller like myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you will find no difficulty in your way. Dick can drive you over to a quiet landing on the bay, which is not far from this place. The steamer that plies along the Narragansett shore always stops there, and you will be landed before night upon the place you wish to visit. The house stands not more than two hundred yards from the shore, so you cannot miss your way. Young ladies often travel alone in this country, and I am sure you will meet with nothing to annoy you."</p>
               <p>"I dare say not, sir, and as you wish it so earnestly, I will undertake this little journey. Let us make out the list of books you wish brought back, and if I fail in everything else, you will at least have them to lighten the tedium of your hours."</p>
               <p>"You will do much more than that, Inez. You will find and secure the proof that the house, and all its contains, is yours at your aunt's decease. Oakland is a more cheerful place than this, and if my hopes are realized, we can remove there to live. I have been laying all sorts of plans for days past, for crippled as I am, I can only plan. Oh! if I had but the use of my limbs for forty-eight hours, how much I could accomplish in that brief space of time."</p>
               <p>Inez kissed him, and nestled more closely to his side. She softly asked:</p>
               <p>"Will you have your evening game now, papa? Since<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6338-00000109"/> this journey is settled for to-morrow, we need talk of it no more."</p>
               <p>"Why not, Inez? Don't you feel excited at the chances before you? To lose or win in such a game as this is no trifle, I can tell you. And as surely as there is a God in Heaven, you will come out loser if your grandfather's will is not found. Mrs. Hawks dislikes me to that degree, that she will impoverish you to deprive me of the triumph of seeing you take possession of the Horton estate after her own death. If I were to die first, it might be different; but now I feel sure that I shall outlive her. She has changed dreadfully since she was in Newport last year, and when she took that fit here, I saw signs which convinced me that she could not stand many more attacks like that. It would not surprise me to hear of her death any day."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, pray don't talk of it. If my aunt could hear you, she might fancy that you are looking for her decease, and almost wishing it to take place."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, I shall not be deceitful enough to cry when it does occur, for Eunice will be better off, and so will you, I hope. You may light the lamp now, and, after one game, you had better retire, to be fresh for your journey to-morrow. Let Dick know that he must have the carriage ready at six. It is lucky that your aunt does not require its use early in the morning or late in the afternoon. After she takes her drive, Dick will have ample time to get to the landing on the day of your return."</p>
               <p>Inez literally obeyed his commands. After the chess-men were put away, she went out and gave minute instructions to Nora as to what was necessary to her father's comfort during her brief absence, and evaded the curiosity of that damsel as to the cause of this sudden departure as well as she could.</p>
               <p>Inez expected to be absent but thirty-six hours, but she shrank from the thought of her father's loneliness during even that brief space of time, and sedulously provided for him such meagre sources of occupation and amusement as lay in his power. Mr. Lopez was touched by her solicitude, and he at length stopped her flitting to and fro by saying:</p>
               <p>"Kiss me good-bye, my darling, and get to your rest. I shall do well enough while you are away. I will enter the enchanted palace of visions, the 'open sesame' to which is one of my magical little pills. I shall walk hand in hand with your mother while you go on the mission she has so earnestly commanded. Don't look so sorrowful, Inez; I must and will have my own way,—so there's an end of it."</p>
               <p>Inez did not offer to remonstrate; she knew how useless it would be; so she kissed him tenderly, and went into her own room to prepare for the journey before her.</p>
               <p>A few necessary articles were packed in a travelling sachel, and she then retired to her couch to think over what might lie before her. Success in this enterprise would bring happiness to her poor father's heart; but a disappointment might bring something she dreaded to think of.</p>
               <p>Dr. Minturn had told her that the heart of Mr. Lopez was seriously affected, and any sudden shock might cause his death. Poor Inez had little faith in the vision which sent her forth on this errand, and she had the deepest fear of its disastrous result to him should it prove a failure.</p>
               <p>It was very late before she slept, and then her dreams took their coloring from her waking thoughts. Although her body rested, her mind drifted through a series of strange and exciting scenes in which her father always played a prominent part.</p>
               <p>Inez awoke at an early hour, feeling weary and unrefreshed, but she made an effort to get up and prepare to set out. Nora had hot coffee for her, and something nice besides; and she forced herself to swallow a few morsels to satisfy the solicitude of the girl.</p>
               <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6338-00000110"/>
               <p>Dick had the carriage ready at the appointed hour, and Inez left her home in pursuit of what she considered a phantom; but only by doing so could her father be satisfied. So she went at his bidding, irrational as the errand seemed to her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez had given her the list of books, and Inez felt some feeble satisfaction in thinking that her journey would not be entirely useless. Her father had long desired to possess several of the works named, and that wish could at least be gratified.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">OAKLAND, AND WHHT WAS FOUND THERE.</head>
               <p>THE early morning drive through the forest road, with the soft sea air fanning her cheeks, and the songs of the birds filling their leafy home with jubilant music, were all delightful to the young traveller, and she thought that, after all, life might yet, for her, have something that was worth enjoying, even if past love had proved a bubble.</p>
               <p>A few miles were rapidly passed over, and the carriage drew up at the landing just as the steamer rounded to.</p>
               <p>"You are just in time, Miss," said Dick, assisting her to alight. "I've put a lad to hold my horses, and if you'll 'low me, I'll see you safe aboard."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Dick. I shall be much obliged, for I should scarcely know how to go by myself."</p>
               <p>"I s'pose not, Miss Inez. But I am to the fore now, and when you gits back to-morrer arternoon, I'll try and be here in time to see you safe off the boat."</p>
               <p>Inez nodded approval, and moved along by his side, glad to have his protection. Dick found her a seat on deck, placed her sachel beside her chair, and then sought out the captain, a bluff, hard-swearing man, to ask him to pay some attention to his unprotected young passenger.</p>
               <p>Captain Owens hastily said:</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye—of course I'll look after the gal. Oakland landing, is it? We'll get there by four o'clock. Always stop five minutes there, so there'll be plenty of time for her to get off. Want to know at what hour I'll be back here to-morrow afternoon? Oh yes—I understand. At six, or half after. That's the ticket, my man."</p>
               <p>The curious oaths with which these sentences were interlarded, would baffle any one save a phonetic scholar to spell. They were quite original, for the captain had been strictly educated, and thought swearing, as understood by others, a sin; but the expletives coined by himself he regarded as a clever compromise.</p>
               <p>"The d—l will never know that I am cussing," he said, "and as to the good man, <emph>He</emph> knows that a fellow can't run a boat without some motive power besides steam."</p>
               <p>He did not mean to be irreverent, nor was he deficient in kindness, for he soon found time to come to the side of the lonely girl and assure her that at four o'clock he would see her on shore at Oakland himself.</p>
               <p>Inez thanked him, and settled herself for the pleasant voyage across the bay. The day was charming, the awning overhead sheltered her from the too ardent rays of the sun, and the buoyant air seemed to fill her languid frame with a portion of its own elasticity.</p>
               <p>There was no one to interrupt the dreamy reverie into which Inez soon fell, for there was but one other passenger on deck beside herself, and he seemed deeply absorbed in the pages of a book he held in his hand.</p>
               <p>He was a pale, fair young man, with colorless hair, and<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6338-00000111"/> that smooth white sleekness of appearance that was peculiarly repulsive to Inez, and she scarcely gave him a second look; if she had done so, she would soon have discovered that the stranger was more interested in watching her fair face than in the volume he was pretending to read.</p>
               <p>She seemed to attract him more and more, for he finally made some movements preliminary to opening a conversation with her. Inez no sooner became aware of this, than she hastily took out a volume of Tennyson, with which she had furnished herself as a refuge against her own thoughts, and absorbed herself so completely in it, that the stranger finally strolled away and left her alone.</p>
               <p>At two o'clock dinner was served, and the captain came himself to conduct her below. She found several other passengers in the cabin, but made no attempt to join in the conversation that took place over the table. Glad to get back into the open air again, she passed the time in alternate dreaming and reading, till the bluff voice of Captain Owens spoke close beside her.</p>
               <p>"Here we are, Miss; in five minutes more you'll be at your place, and I'm glad to say that I've found a beau for you. I could only have put you ashore myself, but this young fellow says he'll see you safe to the house, seeing as he's going there himself to see his uncle, Mr. Wilkins. He says his name is the same, and yours is Lopez, I believe, so I hope, Miss, that you think I've done the right thing by finding an escort for such a slip of a gal as you seem to be."</p>
               <p>The sandy-haired stranger was standing just behind the captain, and after this singular introduction Inez could do no less than bow to Wilkins junior, and thank him for his proffered politeness, though she earnestly wished that he had chosen some other time for his visit to his relatives.</p>
               <p>Inez was annoyed to find that Mr. Wilkins was the same individual who had sat near her earlier in the day, and she shrank from the thought of her visit to Oakland becoming known to this prying, sleek-looking young man, who would certainly seek to discover why she was sent on such an errand, in place of dispatching an order to his uncle for the books that her father wanted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins very politely took her sachel from her hand, and moved jauntily beside her, offering only such assistance as was needed till she stood safely on a sloping bank of turf some distance above the landing, sheltered from the sun by a cluster of oak trees from which the place took its name.</p>
               <p>Scattered over the undulating ground which lay between the ancient-looking house and the water's edge, were groups of the same trees, but they were unpruned, and the ground beneath them was covered with short undergrowth which gave a forlorn and deserted air to the place.</p>
               <p>The house itself was a large, square structure of red brick, with a wing running back toward a kitchen garden, and at the opposite end the tower in which the library was situated.</p>
               <p>Poultry and pigs wandered at will over the large inclosure, the gate to which was secured by a padlock carefully fastened. When Mr. Wilkins ascertained this, and he saw no movement in the house as if any one meant to come to open it, he asked in surprise:</p>
               <p>"Was not my uncle informed of your intention to visit the place, Miss Lopez? <emph>I</emph> came unexpectedly myself, but when I heard that you were on your way here, I took it for granted there would be somebody to meet you."</p>
               <p>Inez had not anticipated such a reception as this, and she was reluctantly forced to explain:</p>
               <p>"My father did not consider it necessary to inform Mr. Wilkins of my intention to come to Oakland for a few hours. I only wish to see the old place, visit the library, and get<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6338-00000112"/> from it some books for which my aunt, Mrs. Hawks, has given an order. Armed with that, it never occurred to me that anything else would be necessary."</p>
               <p>The light eyes of the young man rested on her with an expression of shrewd inquiry, but he was apparently satisfied with the explanation offered, and immediately said:</p>
               <p>"It's a lucky thing for you that I happened along to-day, Miss Lopez, for you could never have made your voice heard at the house, and if you could have got inside of that gate, you might have been severely injured by a fierce dog my uncle keeps. Nipper knows me, and I shall risk nothing in jumping the fence, so if you are not afraid to remain here alone a few moments, I will hurry up to the house and bring the key of the gate."</p>
               <p>Inez glanced around; the steamer was receding in the distance, and the whole scene seemed steeped in the very spirit of seclusion and peace. She smiled as she replied:</p>
               <p>"I should be a terrible coward, indeed, if I were afraid to be left here a few moments. While you are away, I will use my eyes in becoming familiar with the scenes in which my mother's girlhood was passed. I really think it was most fortunate for me, Mr. Wilkins, that you chanced to visit your uncle to-day."</p>
               <p>He bowed with a singular expression, and replied:</p>
               <p>"Then I will be off, and back again as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>The words had scarcely passed his lips before he bounded lightly over the fence, and plunged into a narrow pathway that led toward the house. Soon afterward the deep baying of a dog was heard, and an immense English bull-terrier came bounding toward him with open mouth and fiery eyes.</p>
               <p>But he seemed suddenly to recognize an old acquaintance, for he paused in his wild career, and then crouched at the feet of the young man with a whine of welcome.</p>
               <p>"So-ho, old Nipper! you know me, do you? That's right—down in the dust at the feet of your master! There—there—that will do. Come now, old fellow, I can't afford to lose sight of you—just get!"</p>
               <p>The dog sullenly obeyed the motion of his hand toward the house, though he evidently wished to go on a further quest. Nipper scattered the chickens and ducks that congregated near the house by flying in among them with his deep-mouthed bark; but Wilkins called him to order, and, after leading him into a narrow side-hall, closed the door upon him.</p>
               <p>The entrance was between the main portion of the building and the wing occupied by the tenants. A narrow staircase wound upward from it, and on the right hand was a door which opened into a square room of respectable size. Beyond that was the kitchen, and Wilkins went on to the inner shrine, in which he expected to find his uncle's wife engaged in the congenial occupation of cooking supper.</p>
               <p>As he had anticipated, Mrs. Wilkins was there, and she seemed greatly surprised at the sight of her visitor. She was a fair, sandy-haired woman, with a good-humored though not very sharp face. She took her hands from the dough she was kneading, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Do tell! you here ag'in, Sammy? Why, 'taint more'n a week since you went away. I can't see what can bring you so often to this out o' the way place."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry that you are not glad to see me, Aunt Hannah, but I've no time to explain what brought me here now. I have the pleasure of informing you that I am not your only guest to-day. I left a young lady outside of the gate waiting for admittance, and I have come for the key."</p>
               <p>"A young lady! La sakes, Sammy, I hope you ain't gone an' got married afore you've made anything to live on. If ye <emph>have,</emph> ye needn't be a-bringing of the gal here to be tuck care of."</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6338-00000113"/>
               <p>Wilkins laughed unpleasantly.</p>
               <p>"You need have no fear of such a catastrophe as that, Aunt Hannah. I know how to take care of number one too well to commit such an imprudence. I only wish this young lady <emph>was</emph> my wife, though, for she'll own every foot of the land we're standing on before long. It is Miss Lopez, and she has been sent here by her father on some fool's errand about books from the library, so please give me the key at once."</p>
               <p>"Goodness! one of the old stock. She mustn't be kept waiting outside the gate no how. There's the key; but if your uncle says anything about the gate being opened without his knowledge, you must take the blame on yourself. Tom Wilkins is a curious fellow, and not so good-tempered as he might be."</p>
               <p>Her nephew scarcely listened to the last words. He seized the key, leaving the dog a prisoner in the house, and, springing out, hurried to the spot on which he had left Inez standing.</p>
               <p>The gate was unlocked, and together the two wound through the narrow pathway leading to the house By the time they gained the open space in front of the stately portico, the door was opened, and Mrs. Wilkins, with a clean apron and newly-smoothed hair, stood on its threshold ready to welcome the last descendant of the Horton family to the homestead of her grandfather. She glibly said:</p>
               <p>"You've took me quite unawares, Miss Lopez, but you're welcome to the old place all the same. You're the only one of the family that's visited Oakland in the fifteen year we've lived here; but I'm sorry you didn't let me know you was a-coming, and you shouldn't have been kept waiting at the gate so long. Sakes alive! if Sammy here hadn't come along, I don't know how you'd a-got in anyhow!"</p>
               <p>To this address, Inez smilingly replied:</p>
               <p>"I did not know that I was coming myself till yesterday evening, Mrs. Wilkins, but I hope my brief visit will not be an inconvenience to you. I only came to look over the old place; to see the library, and select from it some books which my aunt has been kind enough to allow my father the use of."</p>
               <p>"Books, is it, that you've come after, Miss? You'll find 'em all right, for nobody has meddled with 'em but Sammy there, and he was only 'lowed to read and dust 'em, without taking any on 'em away. My husband wouldn't let him do that nohow."</p>
               <p>While speaking, Mrs. Wilkins led the way into a wide, handsomely proportioned vestibule entirely destitute of furniture, and unclosed a door of carved oak on the left hand side, which gave entrance into a large apartment, the floor of which was covered with a faded Brussels carpet.</p>
               <p>She threw open one of the massive shutters, and the light from a tall curtainless window fell upon the Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs, covered with damask that had once been scarlet, but had now passed into the sere and yellow leaf of partial decay.</p>
               <p>Several family portraits hung upon the walls, and among them, Inez was surprised to find one of her grandfather, which, at a glance, she knew had been painted by Stuart. That, at least, she thought, should have been removed by his daughter, on account of the value of the painting, if from no feeling of reverence for the original.</p>
               <p>It represented Mr. Horton in his youth, in the powder and queue worn in the latter half of the last century. He was a handsome, but weak looking man, and Inez wondered if he really had possessed, at the last, decision enough to rescue the child of his cast-off daughter from dependence on her sister.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins placed the sachel of Inez on a table, and<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6338-00000114"/> muttered something about the necessity of seeing his uncle on business. He hastily left the room, telegraphing to his aunt to follow him, and the two stood a few moments in the vestibule in earnest conversation.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilkins then came back, and said:</p>
               <p>"My nephew tells me that he can't stop here to entertain you, Miss, as I expected he would; and as I keep no help, I must excuse myself and go back to the kitchen to look after my supper. I must see to getting you something nice at once."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Wilkins, but I am not at all hungry, and I beg that you will not put yourself to any trouble on my account. A cup of tea, and a slice of cold bread and butter, will be quite enough for me."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, Miss, I can give you better than that, and Sammy must have something more substantial, too. <emph>He</emph> don't b'lieve in no sich wishy washy stuff as tea. I aint got no store tea nohow, but I guess sassafrax or sage will do jest as well."</p>
               <p>"Sage tea! that is a medicine, and so is the other. I believe I will not trouble you to make tea at all if you please, Mrs. Wilkins. I like milk for supper, and you can give me a glass of that."</p>
               <p>"But there's plenty o' them yerbs, and I jest as leave make the tea as not, Miss Lopez," persisted the woman, on hospitable thoughts intent.</p>
               <p>"I beg that you will not do so for me, for I could not drink either of the teas you mentioned. It is of little consequence what is set before me."</p>
               <p>"Jest hear to that now! 'taint o' no consequence what you get in this yer house where your mother, and her father afore her was born? I'd be afeard o' their ghosts haunting me if I didn't do the best I can for the credit o' the place, Miss Lopez. But I won't keep you talking no longer, for you look tired like, and you had better lie down on the sofy there, and rest a bit."</p>
               <p>Inez was glad to avail herself of this advice, for she was still too weak to sit up all day. She drew the sofa cushion beneath her head, listened to the receding echo of footsteps as Mrs. Wilkins and her nephew went toward the rear of the house, and then gave up her fancy to the thoughts that crowded on it.</p>
               <p>But soon they mingled, faded away, and the fatigue of the day threw her into a sweet, and refreshing sleep.</p>
               <p>Little faith as Inez had in her father's visions, one now came to herself that impressed her vividly. She thought that the portrait of her grandfather, which hung over the sofa on which she reclined, suddenly bent forward, and in a voice of deep sorrow, spoke these words:</p>
               <p>"Too late!—<emph>too late!</emph> Why did you not come a day, a few hours sooner. Awake! be up and doing now, and you may save all. But no—it is too late—<emph>too late!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Inez started up with the thrilling sounds of that weird warning ringing in her ears, and saw before her Mrs. Wilkins, who was saying:</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to disturb you, Miss Lopez; but my supper is ready, and the light biscuits will spile if they bakes too long, and it's getting late—very late."</p>
               <p>The words seemed almost an echo of those she had heard in her dream, and Inez smiled as she thought how easily her vision had dissolved into something so commonplace as the announcement of a late supper. She saw that the sun was setting, and she arose and smoothed her hair before the large mirror which occupied the space between two of the windows.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilkins then led the way to the kitchen, or living room, as she called it. This was gained by crossing a long piazza, at the back of the house on which it opened. Inez<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6338-00000115"/> found herself in a large oblong room, with a rag carpet on the floor, and a stove in the farthest end of the apartment. Closets in the walls concealed the cooking utensils, and on a charcoal furnace on the wide hearth the tea kettle was merrily singing.</p>
               <p>The welcome aroma of what Mrs. Wilkins called "store tea," greeted Inez on her entrance, and her hostess said in explanation:</p>
               <p>"Sammy brought some from town to-day, Miss. When he was here last week he turned up his nose at the sassafrax tea I made for him, and told me he'd bring me something better the next time he came. It's lucky for you that he did so, I guess, for you look as if you want something to set you up. Been sick, I guess?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I have lately had a slight attack of illness from which I have not entirely recovered."</p>
               <p>"La sakes! and yet you come all the way here by yourself, as one may say, for Sammy didn't know anything about you till jest afore you got off the boat. Why didn't yer par come hisself now?"</p>
               <p>"My father's health is so delicate that he rarely leaves the house," replied Inez. "He thought the trip would benefit me, and I was glad of an excuse to visit a place that is so interesting to me as this one. But what has become of your nephew?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, <emph>he's</emph> had his supper, and he'll be off agin on the night boat. He only came to see his uncle 'bout a law suit he's 'tending to for him, for Sammy's a mighty 'cute lawyer. As soon as he got a bite he went out in the harvest field to see Tom, and he was off without ever coming back to the house at all."</p>
               <p>Inez was most happy to hear of this unexpected deliverance from the espionage of Mr. Wilkins, and she ate the broiled chicken and toast which had been prepared for her with much more enjoyment than if he had been sitting opposite to her at the neatly spread table. She found that she must have slept two hours, for the sun had by this time sunk to rest amid a flood of golden glory, which afforded assurance of a brilliant day on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Inez was glad of this, for now she was actually at Oakland, she wished to roam over the place and visit every spot of interest it contained. She inquired for the key of the library, and Mrs. Wilkins said:</p>
               <p>"It's in the door now, Miss Lopez. Sammy went in there while I was a fixing the supper, to set things to rights a little. Not that the place aint kept strait enough, but when the lad was here not long ago he used that ere room to read in and to keep his guns and fishing-tackle in. But he's cleared 'em all out now, and I guess there's nothing left that don't belong there."</p>
               <p>"You guess; why didn't you go and make sure, Hannah Wilkins?" asked a gruff voice so close to Inez that it made her start and turn quickly in the direction of the speaker. He nodded his head to Inez and went on:</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> have always found it necessary to look after that nephew of mine, for he is as careless as—as—nobody ought to be. I've been into the lib'ry myself, and I found that he had left his memorandum book behind him. I'm blessed though if anybody can make out a thing that's in it, for it's all writ in shorthand. He's a 'cute chap, careless as he is. Your servant, Miss," and Mr. Wilkins made a more respectful bow to the young girl who he knew was the next heir to the property on which he lived.</p>
               <p>He was a large, healthy looking man, with fair complexion, light blue eyes, and a coarse under jaw. He looked shrewder than his wife, but it was evident that neither of them was above the average of common farm hands in either manners or education.</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6338-00000116"/>
               <p>Inez explained to Wilkins the object of her visit, and he offered to accompany her at once to the library that she might see with what care the books had been kept.</p>
               <p>Finding that he had already taken his supper with his nephew, Inez gladly accepted his offer, and rising, followed him toward the front building.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STRANGE AND ALARMING INTERVIEW.</head>
               <p>CROSSING the back gallery, Mr. Wilkins entered the rear hall communicating with the vestibule. From this a door opened into a handsome room meagerly furnished with a camp bedstead, a plain writing table, wash-stand, and chairs of black walnut. A faded carpet covered the floor, and a wide old-fashioned sofa stood between two large windows, which had been opened to admit the evening air.</p>
               <p>Wilkins strode across the floor and in the farthest corner threw open a door which gave admittance to the tower which Mr. Horton had added to his house, to be first used as a dressing-room for his wife, and after her death to be converted into a library.</p>
               <p>It was an octagon room, chiefly lighted through a ground glass dome, for the narrow slits of windows filled with colored glass were more ornamental than useful.</p>
               <p>A circular table, on which was a reading lamp with its bright green shade, occupied the centre of the floor, and several heavily carved chairs were drawn up near it. The book-cases were built in the wall, with doors filled in with small squares of glass set in fantastic arabesque patterns, and over each one was a niche filled with alternate busts of American and foreign celebrities. Washington and Franklin, Mirabeau and Napoleon were there, and over the door was that of the man Mr. Horton believed the greatest Roman of them all—Andrew Jackson.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins talked a great deal, and explained to Inez many things in his clumsy fashion, but she scarcely listened to him. Her thoughts were in that book-case on the left hand, and she was glad to see that a flight of steps used for mounting to the highest shelves was in the room.</p>
               <p>She asked:</p>
               <p>"Can I gain access to all these cases, Mr. Wilkins? I have quite a list of books which my father wishes me to take to him. But I utterly forgot to bring a trunk to pack them in."</p>
               <p>"Oh, that's no matter, Miss; we can find a box, I guess, to nail 'em up in; but if you mean to take many of 'em away with you, I'd like to have the order of Mrs. Hawks to prove that I only did what she wanted done."</p>
               <p>"Of course—that is but right. Here it is. You know my aunt's writing, and if you choose you can keep the order."</p>
               <p>Inez produced the few lines written by her aunt, authorizing her father to send for any books he might desire to remove from the Oakland library, and after glancing over it Wilkins said:</p>
               <p>"It's all reg'lar, Miss. I knows Mrs. Hawks' writing well enough, for she often sends orders about what's to be done on the place. Them doors ain't got no locks on 'em, except one, and I see the key is in that."</p>
               <p>He pointed to the very case on which the attention of Inez was fixed, and went on:</p>
               <p>"I don't know why <emph>that</emph> one was kept locked any more'n the others, for the books in it ain't any more valuable than them that's on the other shelves; but I s'pose 'twas a fancy<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6338-00000117"/> of the old master's. I've heard tell that he was a notionate man."</p>
               <p>Inez glanced over the books and saw that the upper shelves were filled with Greek and Latin classics, and the lower with standard works in French and German. She said:</p>
               <p>"Those volumes are more costly than English books, and that is the reason, I suppose, why they were better taken care of."</p>
               <p>"Mebbe so, Miss; and now while you have some daylight left, I'll leave you to look out what you want, while I attend to my chores. You can jest lay the books out on the table, and I'll pack 'em for you in the morning before I go out to my work."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I will not detain you any longer then. I can easily attend to what brought me here without any assistance."</p>
               <p>Wilkins nodded, shuffled out of the room, and when Inez could no longer hear the echo of his steps, she sprang to the step ladder and after some effort succeeded in drawing it near enough to the case in which her investigation was to be made, to enable her to reach the top shelf with ease.</p>
               <p>It was the work of a few moments to remove four large volumes which filled the corner so minutely described by her father, and in a painful flutter of excitement, she stooped forward and felt for the spring she had been assured must be found there.</p>
               <p>At one point she found a crevice wide enough to permit the fingers to penetrate an inch below the edge of the shelf, and after moving them carefully over the space, to her surprise and delight they came in contact with what seemed a small protuberance.</p>
               <p>Pressing with all her force on this, to her intense amazement Inez saw the wooden back slide slowly down, disclosing an aperture contrived in the brick wall beyond.</p>
               <p>It was a square cavity, formed by removing two bricks each way in the thickness of the wall; but, carefully as it had been concealed, there was nothing in it to repay the excited girl for the trouble of making a visit to the place.</p>
               <p>"Poor papa, what will he say—what will he do now?" was her first thought; and utterly unnerved by the breaking down of the hope which had sprung to life on finding her father's vision partly verified, Inez came down from her uncomfortable perch, and sat down to try and compose herself sufficiently to replace the books she had taken down before the return of Wilkins.</p>
               <p>This she had ample time to accomplish, for the farmer had many things to attend to before his evening's work was finished.</p>
               <p>Inez had not permitted herself to hope for a successful result to the strange quest on which she had been sent, yet she was deeply depressed by the ineffectual discovery she had made. The receptacle so singularly made known to her father was there, but its contents had disappeared, by what agency it was now impossible to discover.</p>
               <p>That her aunt was ignorant of its existence she felt assured, for she did not believe that Mrs. Hawks would be capable of defrauding her of her just rights; and if such a document as her father had described had been concealed at Oakland with her knowledge, her conduct could bear no other interpretation, for by her orders it must have been removed to leave the fate of her niece entirely at her mercy.</p>
               <p>Inez rejected this suspicion. She scarcely thought of the disappointment as it affected herself; she was too deeply dreading what might happen to her father when she told her story on her return home.</p>
               <p>She regained her composure as well as she could, and began to select the books he had desired to have. A dozen volumes comprised the whole of them, and when Mr. Wilkins<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6338-00000118"/> kins returned, they were laid on the table ready to be removed.</p>
               <p>By this time twilight had gathered around her, and Inez pointed to the volumes and carelessly said:</p>
               <p>"Those are all I shall take with me, Mr. Wilkins. I must leave to-morrow on the same boat I came over on, and I shall be glad if you will have them packed in time. I will go out now, and walk about a little. Your dog will not molest me, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Oh no, Miss; I've taken good care of that, and Nipper's fastened up safe enough. I never 'lows him the run of the place when strangers is about, for he's a dangerous customer. In a lonesome country place like this, a good dog is worth a great deal. I lock the gate to keep stragglers out, and old Nip. knows it's his business to keep things straight and square inside the enclosure. That's what he's kept for, and he's smart enough to know it, Miss."</p>
               <p>"I dare say," replied Inez, vaguely; and, occupied with her own thoughts, she moved dreamily toward the front entrance, and descending the flight of steps leading into the yard, made her way though the tangled undergrowth till she came to a half-ruined summer house which commanded a beautiful view of the bay and the surrounding country.</p>
               <p>This spot her father had often described to her. Here he had sat with her mother; here he had won her consent to become his bride; and here the elopement they subsequently made had been planned.</p>
               <p>Inez also knew that her mother's remains had been brought back to the home of her youth to be laid in the family burying ground, and she turned into a narrow, weed-grown pathway which led across a gentle hill into a picturesque valley beyond, in which arose the monuments of the deceased members of the Horton family, enclosed by a handsome iron railing.</p>
               <p>The one erected to the memory of her grandfather was the most imposing, and beneath its shadow was a plain marble slab bearing the simple inscription:</p>
               <p>"Sacred to the memory of Susan Horton Lopez, born Anno Domini 1S10, Died A. D. 1833, aged 23 years.—<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Requiescat in pace.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>A cross was carved beneath, and before this symbol of her faith Inez knelt and prayed fervently.</p>
               <p>If the spirit of her mother had indeed led her hither, it must have been to make this pious pilgrimage to her tomb; and with the consoling faith of the Catholic, she prayed for the repose of the souls of the two who lay there side by side peacefully enough, in spite of the gulf which had opened between them while living.</p>
               <p>The summer moon was shining brightly when she arose, and slowly and pensively returned to the house. She found Mrs. Wilkins preparing to go in search of her, and she said in explanation of her anxiety:</p>
               <p>"The dew's bin falling some time, Miss, and you don't look strong enough to stand much. I've got a nice cup of sage tea ready for you, and if you'll drink it I think it will be good for you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Wilkins, for the kindness of your intention; but you have taken more trouble than was necessary on my account. I am afraid that I must be ungrateful enough to decline the sage tea, as I never drink anything of the kind."</p>
               <p>"La sakes! but it's the best thing in natur' for weak and ailing people. As to the trouble, that's neither here nor there. The tea's made, and you'll drink a little of it, I guess, and you really look as if you want something to strengthen you. I'll bring a cup of it to your room anyhow. And that 'minds me—I hope you aint afeard to sleep in a room by yourself; for the only one fit to put you in is that one j'ining the libr'y, where old Mr. Horton used to sleep<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6338-00000119"/> hisself. 'Taint so far off from me and Tom, for the back window looks out to our part of the house, and if you was to call out in the night we'd hear you easy enough."</p>
               <p>"When I am at home I sleep in a room alone, Mrs. Wilkins, and I do not think I shall be afraid to do so here, though the place is strange to me. There is a good lock on the door, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; the fastenings is in the best of order, for Wilkins is something of a locksmith, and he 'tends to that, as Mrs. Hawks 'lows him something for keeping things 'bout the house in repair. You'll excuse him for not coming to speak with you again, Miss; for he's dead tired with working all day in the harvest field, and he's gone to bed half an hour ago."</p>
               <p>"Has Mr. Wilkins no one to assist him?"</p>
               <p>"We don't keep a hired man. The place ain't large, and with help now and then, Tom manages to get along very well, since Sammy left us. Sammy lived with us from the time he was a little fellow, but he got above farm work, and was sent away to school. Then he studied law, and now he's doing business for himself down to Newport. He's the junior partner, and I guess he does a good deal of the work without getting much of the profits, as is apt to be the case when young men like him gets into business with longheaded men what's got a good start. But Sammy don't complain; not he. He says that his turn will come some day, and then he'll show the stuff he's made of."</p>
               <p>Inez vaguely wondered if it was honest or reliable stuff, but as the future of Wilkins junior was of the least possible interest to her, she made no comment on his aunt's communications.</p>
               <p>She was really glad to retire to the room prepared for her, and even consented to taste the nauseous beverage Mrs. Wilkins hastened to bring in to her, though she declined doing more than that in spite of the good woman's praises of it as the best remedy extant for nearly every bodily ailment to which flesh is heir.</p>
               <p>With a disappointed look, she took up the cup and asked:</p>
               <p>"Can I do anything more for you, Miss Lopez? You have only to speak to command me."</p>
               <p>"Nothing more, thank you. I can wait on myself, and I have night clothes, brushes, and combs in my sachel. I shall be asleep in ten minutes after I get into bed."</p>
               <p>"I hope so, Miss; and I'm sure that nothing will happen to disturb you. The dog barking around the house is the only sound I hear at night, but he'll not disturb you, for Tom has shet him up in an outhouse to stay there till you go away. He's a mighty smart dog, but he's too sharp to be kept around when strangers is on the place."</p>
               <p>"Will he not be needed as a guard to-night? He could be shut up in the morning again before I am ready to go out."</p>
               <p>"So he might; but Tom has put him up, and I guess he'll have to stay where he is all night. <emph>I</emph> wouldn't go after him for my right hand, for as well as he knows me, Nipper would be likely to jump at me, and nearly tear me in pieces if I went nigh him after he's been shet up a spell. He ain't to be trusted nohow."</p>
               <p>With this assertion, Mrs. Wilkins nodded, and was about to leave the room when the eyes of her young guest suddenly fell upon a small enamel picture on which the full glare of the lamp fell. For a moment she thought it was the face of Nina Gordon looking down upon her from the wall, but a second glance showed her that the dress of the portrait was of the fashion of a past day, and arresting the departing steps of Mrs. Wilkins, Inez asked:</p>
               <p>"Whose picture is that? It is strangely like a young girl I have lately met."</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6338-00000120"/>
               <p>"That! Oh, <emph>she</emph> aint one of the family; but she was a great favorite with your grandpa, I've heard tell; and when a great painter came here to take the pictures of his darters, Mr. Horton would have Anna Moore's painted at the same time. It's always hung there since my time, just as the old gentleman placed it himself."</p>
               <p>"Who was Anna Moore, and how came my grandfather to be so fond of her?"</p>
               <p>"She was only the housekeeper's darter, but she was pretty, and smart, and Mr. Horton had her eddicated with your ma and Mrs. Hawks, but when they all growed up, poor Anna found out that she was spiled for people of her own sort, and them that was above her wouldn't look at her as one o' theirselves. There was some strange things told about her, but I don't mind 'em much now, it's so long ago; and she's been married many a year ago to some man in Virginny that they say has made a fortin.' Some people's born with a silver spoon in their mouths, you know the old saying is, but I guess that Anna Moore found some bitter in the portion it held before a good time came for her."</p>
               <p>"She had trials, then, before she was prosperous?"</p>
               <p>The woman shook her head mysteriously:</p>
               <p>"Yes, many hard trials; but 'taint good to rip up old stories, and what folks said of her shouldn't be repeated to a young thing like you. Good night, Miss Lopez; I hope you'll have only pleasant dreams in the old house that will be your own some day, my husband says."</p>
               <p>The door closed on her, and after a faint sigh given to the uncertainty of Mr. Wilkins' prediction proving true, Inez took up the lamp and examined the face which had so struck her. She saw that the resemblance between the picture and Nina Gordon lay in the peculiar eyes, and the color of the hair. The turn of the head was also the same, but the mouth of Anna Moore was sad and earnest, while that of Nina was mocking and mirthful.</p>
               <p>"Strange," she muttered, "that the girl who is using every effort to supplant me in my aunt's favor, should look so like one who was reared with her and my mother. Miss Gordon knows nothing of her family, and Mrs. Wilkins evidently hinted at something wrong about the original of this picture. I wonder if the two can be linked together in any way. But I am too tired to think about it, and all the thinking I could do would not help me to a solution of the mystery."</p>
               <p>Thus thinking, Inez prepared herself for repose. She locked the door, lowered the lamp, and set it in the fire-place, then, after praying devoutly, she took refuge in the comfortable bed with its lavender-scented linen, and composed her mind to sleep.</p>
               <p>Wearied with the varied excitements of the day, Inez soon fell into a sound slumber, which must have lasted several hours, for when she awoke she found the room in darkness, and she started out of her sleep with the consciousness that some one beside herself was in the apartment.</p>
               <p>She was certain that she could distinguish a faint sound of breathing not far distant from her bed, but her terror was so extreme that she had no voice to cry out and give the alarm, even if Wilkins and his wife could have heard her in their distant room.</p>
               <p>Inez lay breathless with fear and excitement, dreading what might happen next, when suddenly the door of the library was thrown open, and a thin stream of light flashed across the darkness.</p>
               <p>A suppressed voice said:</p>
               <p>"Hist, Jemmy, what are you doing in there? Come back, and let us get away. There is nothing here; that cursed fellow has been too sharp for me, and the papers are gone. There is nothing further to be done here, so we had better hurry and be gone, too."</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6338-00000121"/>
               <p>To this another voice replied in guarded tones:</p>
               <p>"There's somebody in this room. I found a lamp burning, and a woman's toggery lying around. She's awake by this time, I dare say, and you had better say something to her to keep her from giving an alarm. If anybody should find out about this nocturnal visit, we might get into trouble."</p>
               <p>"<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Diable,</foreign>" exclaimed the first speaker, "that is a bad lookout. I shouldn't like to do anybody a violence, but if old Wilkins comes out with that brute of a dog, I shall be compelled to use my six-shooter in self-defence. You speak to the woman yourself; tell her to keep quiet, and we'll go away from here no better off than when we came. Let her understand that we are not house-breakers, and all we came for was a bundle of papers that can't be found."</p>
               <p>By this time Inez had regained a portion of her self-control, but in the irrepressible excitement of the moment she forgot the danger in which herself might be placed, and eagerly spoke from the darkened corner in which she lay:</p>
               <p>"Who are you, and what use did you intend to make of the papers to which you refer?"</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! that is the voice of Miss Lopez herself! What on earth brought <emph>her</emph> here? Come out of that, Jemmy, and let me speak to her."</p>
               <p>Inez saw the outline of a head in the faintly-illumined doorway, but a large slouched hat concealed the features of the man's face, and he was evidently making an effort to disguise his voice:</p>
               <p>"Don't be afraid, Miss, I am not coming into your room, and if you will only be quiet we will go away, and no harm will be done. I must explain to you, Miss Lopez, that the errand that brought me here is one of deep interest to you. I hoped to serve you, I swear I did, or I would never have undertaken such a job as this."</p>
               <p>"In what way, sir?" asked Inez in as firm a tone as she could command.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you. In a hole cleverly concealed in the wall of that room I hoped to find the last will executed by your grandfather, and restore it to you, on certain conditions of course, for I do not pretend to be entirely disinterested in this affair. It has been taken away, but I am sure that I can follow up the party that has gained possession of it and make him produce it at the proper time. That is, I will engage to do so for—a consideration."</p>
               <p>"You must confer with my father on that subject, sir, and now I beg that you will leave this room at once, and I promise not to raise an alarm."</p>
               <p>"It will be better not to do so, Miss. If you can answer one question before I go I shall be very glad: Do you know if Sam Wilkins has been on these premises lately?"</p>
               <p>"He was here a few hours to-day and was alone, I know, in the library. Do you suspect him of taking the will from its hiding-place?"</p>
               <p>"That's neither here nor there; I shall settle with <emph>him</emph> about that. Remember that I am on <emph>your</emph> side, Miss Lopez, and I'll see justice done you yet. Good night! If you will keep quiet about this nocturnal intrusion, I will promise profound secresy on the part of my friend and myself. I may as well tell you that we effected an entrance through the dome, and we shall make our exit the same way. I am only sorry that we failed to get what we came for, but you need not lose heart; the will shall be forthcoming yet,—I pledge my word to that."</p>
               <p>The door was softly closed, but no further sound came, and, after recovering from her perturbation, Inez vainly tried to comprehend the singularity of the adventure through which she had just passed. She slept no more that night, and when the early morning light penetrated to her<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6338-00000122"/> room, she arose and made her toilette, that she might investigate the condition of things in the library.</p>
               <p>She found nothing amiss. The sides of the lantern-like dome were constructed to open on hinges to admit air into the room, and through one of these the nocturnal visitors had doubtless effected their entrance and escape.</p>
               <p>The books they had removed from the shelf still lay upon the table, and the recess in the wall was open. Thus Inez became convinced that the place indicated in her father's dream had actually been the hiding-place of the document it was so important to her to find. Bitter and vain were the regrets she felt, that she had been so dilatory in following up the clue that had been furnished to him. Had she possessed more faith in it and acted more promptly all might have been well; and poor Inez wept a few bitter tears over the disappointment of which she must be the bearer on her return home.</p>
               <p>She decided that it would be best to say nothing to Wilkins or his wife of the strange occurrences of the night, as she might thus unveil to them the real purpose of her own visit to Oakland.</p>
               <p>She felt inclined to trust the assurance of the person who had spoken with her, that he was a friend to her cause, and she vaguely hoped that he would recover the will, and restore it to its lawful owner.</p>
               <p>Inez tried to recall the tones of his voice and identify them, but the effort was vain; yet he seemed familiar with hers, for in spite of the terror, he had recognized it as soon as she spoke, and had called her name.</p>
               <p>After closing the aperture, and replacing the books upon the shelf, Inez went out in search of Mrs. Wilkins. Early as she thought it, she found that the farmer had already had his breakfast, and gone out to his work.</p>
               <p>"Du tell!" exclaimed the woman, "I'd no idee that you'd be up so soon as this, Miss Lopez. I'd a had everything ready for you if I'd only known that you was what Tom calls a early bird. But I'll have your tea and muffins ready in half an hour at the latest."</p>
               <p>"I hoped that I should be in time to breakfast with yourself and your husband, Mrs. Wilkins; for I did not wish to put you to the trouble of preparing a second meal for me."</p>
               <p>"Oh! as to that, Miss, I aint accustomed to spare myself, and what you eat ain't any more'n the pecking of a sparrow. You jest walk 'round a spell, and your breakfast will be ready afore you have time to get hungry for it."</p>
               <p>Inez left her, and went out on the front portico, from which she could see the mists slowly curling up from the face of the bay and floating in filmy wreaths toward the zenith, to be absorbed in the rays of the ardent summer sun, which, by this time had risen above the verge of the horizon.</p>
               <p>The air was vocal with the song of birds, and as she glanced over the neglected lawn, Inez thought what a pleasant home this must have been in her grandfather's time, and what an agreeable change from the sombre Glades this place would be for her father, should it ever come into her possession.</p>
               <p>Then her thoughts wandered away into the dim future, and she was surprised when the summons to breakfast came.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wilkins talked the whole time she was eating, for the good woman so rarely had a visitor that she was determined to make the most of her opportunity when one did come; but Inez was so deeply absorbed in her own thoughts that she scarcely listened to her.</p>
               <p>She spent the morning in exploring the place, and when she returned to the house at noon, she found the books she had selected to take away nailed up in a small square box,<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6338-00000123"/> and Wilkins ready for the dinner his wife was placing on the table.</p>
               <p>When they were seated, he turned toward his young guest, and asked:</p>
               <p>"Did you hear anything last night that frighted you, Miss? Steps, or something o' that sort? But 'taint likely that you did, for if you had, a young gal like you would have been sure to squall out and make a row. You needn't look so scared like, for no harm was done, though I'll swear that there was tracks around the yard this morning that nobody made what belongs here. If I hadn't shut Nipper up last night he'd ha' made mince meat o' the man that made 'em; but I thought he'd bark and keep you awake, so I put the old guard in the cellar."</p>
               <p>Inez was glad that he talked on without expecting an answer; but when he ceased speaking, she found voice to ask:</p>
               <p>"Have you any idea who could have been on the place, Mr. Wilkins?"</p>
               <p>"None—unless it was a couple of city chaps that came here a week ago and wanted me to leave 'em alone in the li'bry for half an hour. They offered me a hundred dollars if I would do so, and swore that not a book should be took away; that I might see for myself when I come back that everything was jest as I had left it. I had no notion of doing sich a thing, so I turned 'em out, telling 'em that if anything is hid away in the place I am bound to take care of it for its lawful owners."</p>
               <p>"What did these men look like?" asked Inez, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"They was good looking chaps enough, I dare say, when they had the hair off their faces; but they both had on false whiskers, and mustachers. One was a wiry little fellow with black eyes, and the other one was large, and fair, with grey eyes, and light hair. That one was mighty soft spoken, but his nice talk didn't make me trust him a bit more'n the other one, though I overheard <emph>him</emph> say:</p>
               <p>"'Why don't you throttle him, Ben, and I'll keep guard over him till you get what you want?'</p>
               <p>"The other one shook his head, and said in the same tone:</p>
               <p>"'We'll try a better dodge than that. I don't want to get into trouble, for what we are about must be done quietly, or it will be of no benefit to <emph>us.</emph>'</p>
               <p>"So they went away when they found they could do nothing with me, and I was glad enough to see 'em off. This morning when I saw them strange tracks, I thought they had taken advantage of Nipper's being shet up, and made good their entrance in the li'bry. But they wouldn't ha' done that without disturbing you, I guess, so I must ha' been mistaken."</p>
               <p>Inez felt tempted to reveal the alarm she had had, but some undefined, feeling that it would be best for her own interests to keep her own counsel, withheld her.</p>
               <p>When dinner was over, Wilkins said:</p>
               <p>"You'd better get on your bonnet, Miss, and walk with me down to the landing. The boat is due in fifteen minutes more, and the captain don't stop long when there's no freight to be took up."</p>
               <p>In a short time Inez was ready to accompany him; Mrs. Wilkins put on her sun bonnet and walked with them, the farmer carrying the box of books as lightly as if it had been a lady's work bag.</p>
               <p>Just as they reached the gate, the whistle of the approaching steamer was heard, and thanking Mrs. Wilkins for her attention, and taking a friendly leave of her, Inez followed the stalwart form of the farmer, and was soon safe on board the boat.</p>
               <p>Wilkins had time to ascend to the deck, and find a seat<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6338-00000124"/> for her before leaving. Inez offered him her hand, and smilingly said:</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Wilkins; I shall not forget you nor your wife, and if it is ever in my power, I will return the kindness you have both shewn me."</p>
               <p>"'Twan't much we could do for you, Miss, but sich as it was, you was welcome to, and I do hope that you will remember us when <emph>your</emph> day comes, though 'twan't no sich motive that made Hannah and me polite to one of the old stock."</p>
               <p>The bell here sounded its warning, and the farmer hurried away, leaving Inez alone in a small crowd of pleasure-seekers who were on their way to Newport. But she evaded all attempts on the part of her fellow-passengers to open a conversation with her by taking out her volume of Tennyson, and absorbing herself in its pages.</p>
               <p>The steamer set steadily for the opposite shore, and as the sun was nearing the horizon, it reached the point at which Miss Lopez was to land. Dick was already there with the carriage, and he came to the gangway to meet her. He reported her father about as usual, and after a rapid drive, Inez found herself once more beneath the gloomy shadows of the Glades, no better off than when she had left them.</p>
               <p>When she went in her father greeted her with fiery excitement flashing from every feature of his expressive face.</p>
               <p>"You have it, Inez? You have secured the deed that gives you independence—wealth? Show it to me at once, and relieve me from this intolerable suspense."</p>
               <p>Inez burst in tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa! dear father, don't excite yourself so much. I—I have brought nothing back with me. My journey was a failure so far as securing the will was concerned, but I am now convinced that such a thing was actually concealed there. I believe that we shall recover it, so pray don't look so ghastly."</p>
               <p>At her first words Lopez sunk back gasping for breath, a livid pallor overspreading his face; but he caught as eagerly at her last assurance as a drowning man clutches at a straw; the blood surged back from his heart, a faint tinge of color came to his sallow cheeks, and he found voice to say:</p>
               <p>"You would not speak thus if you had not something important to reveal. Tell me at once what it is."</p>
               <p>Inez found it very difficult to relate to him what had actually occurred during her stay at Oakland; but she finally managed to do so, and she pitied the keen disappointment she read in his eyes.</p>
               <p>With a pathetic kind of despair, he cried:</p>
               <p>"It <emph>was</emph> there, after all, and yet the warning was vain. Oh! why, why did we not sooner act on it! But we have a clue. Young Wilkins must have gone there to gain possession of it; I will threaten him with a prosecution, and force him to give it up. We are not groping in the dark as we were before."</p>
               <p>"But he will deny it, papa, and we have no positive proof that such a thing was ever concealed at Oakland, unless the person who spoke with me last night chooses to come forward as our witness. He promised to serve me, and, strange as the whole thing seems, I am inclined to trust him. We can wait a little, and see what time will develop."</p>
               <p>"Wait—wait—I have not long to do that, Inez, for I feel that my strength is failing me fast. This business must be settled one way or another before I die, or I shall not be able to rest quietly in my grave. I feel this evening as if old Hawks might outlive me, though the other day I was confident that mine is the best life of the two. Oh! if she should cheat me out of seeing you in possession of your grandfather's estate, I believe I could torment her in the other world."</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6338-00000125"/>
               <p>"Dear papa, don't talk so, I cannot bear it. Tell me how you have spent the time since I went away."</p>
               <p>"In the clouds, of course; and now that I am compelled to come back to this weary earth, it is no wonder that you find me excitable and hard to manage. My darling, if I did not see you near me when I awake to the dreary realities around me, I should be glad to close my eyes upon the world forever. At last I am worn out—exhausted with the struggle to bear the sad monotony of my life; and if God would take me to his rest, I should be only too happy to enter upon it."</p>
               <p>Inez sat down beside him, and soothed him with gentle and hopeful words, and he brightened under their influence till he began to look and feel as if there was something yet worth living for.</p>
               <p>But her keen eyes detected a change for the worse in his condition, and she silently removed from his side the box of opium from which she knew he had heavily drugged himself during her absence.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE WILL OF MRS. HAWKS IS MADE.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning, while at breakfast with her father, Inez received from her aunt a note summoning her to Newport, and with tremulous surprise she read the contents:</p>

                           <p>"Since I am informed that you have been at Oakland two days this week, I presume that you have recovered sufficiently to visit me here. It is necessary that you shall do so without delay, as I have that to say to you which is important to both of us.</p>
                           <p>"Treachery I scarcely looked for from <emph>you,</emph> Inez, though I have experienced little else from your father's hands from the day we first met.</p>

               <p>Lopez made an imperious gesture for the missive to be given to him, and asked:</p>
               <p>"What can the old girl have to say that makes you change color so, Inez?"</p>
               <p>He glanced over the lines, his lips curling sardonically at the reference to himself, and he shrugged his shoulders as he went on:</p>
               <p>"I wonder if she has an inkling of what took you to Oakland. But even if she has, that does not give her a right to accuse you of treachery. As to what I have been guilty of in that line where Eunice is concerned, I am sure it would puzzle her to tell. Get ready at once, my dear, and go to this unreasonable old woman, and try to bring her to her right senses. She is only seeking an excuse for acting badly toward you, and your own conduct must not afford her one."</p>
               <p>Though Inez was indignant at being summoned like a criminal to answer for her actions before her aunt, she thought it best to go, and see what was wrong; so she prepared for the visit, and was soon on her way to Newport.</p>
               <p>She endeavored to arrange in her own mind what she should say of her visit to Oakland that would not betray the real object she had in view in going there; for she knew that Mrs. Hawks would never forgive any attempt on her part to recover a will the very existence of which she had strenuously denied.</p>
               <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6338-00000126"/>
               <p>But all her pre-arranged plans were set at naught by the first words of the old lady. She found her lying on a sofa, pale, and panting, with a letter clutched in her hands which she threw at her niece as soon as she was fairly in the room, and screamed:</p>
               <p>"Read that, you ingrate, and tell me how you dared to go to <emph>my</emph> house on such an errand as took you there. Books, indeed! That wretched old hypocrite pretended he wanted them, only to get an opportunity to rob me of papers that I alone have a right to, if they were to be found at Oakland. What do you say to what that letter tells me, you unprincipled girl?"</p>
               <p>In a tremor of dread and expectation, Inez lifted the crumpled sheet from the floor, and smoothed it out while Mrs. Perkins spoke to her mistress in a tone of remonstrance:</p>
               <p>"I entreat that you won't be so violent, ma'am. If Miss Inez has done anything you disapprove, she only obeyed her father, and you ought not to hold her responsible."</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, and get out of my sight. I am not going to be ruled by you, or by <emph>her</emph> either, and I will yet prove more than a match for you both," was the furious response.</p>
               <p>"But, ma'am, you will bring on another of them spells, and of late your spasms have got to be frightful."</p>
               <p>"Yes—and you only wish that I may die in one of them without making my will; but I shan't do it. I have sent for my lawyer, and he will be here in an hour. I shall make it this day, and do what I please with my money. Leave me with Inez; I don't want you putting in your officious tongue every moment while we are talking together."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins made a dignified obeisance, and retired to the small dressing closet in which she slept, taking care however, to leave the door ajar to enable her to overhear all that passed in the chamber of her mistress.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, Inez read the following lines, evidently written in a disguised hand, and sent without a signature:</p>

                           <p>"MADAM:—It becomes my painful duty to warn you of underhand doings among those who are most nearly connected with you.</p>
                           <p>"In the library at Oakland is a secret receptacle in which valuable papers were concealed. By some means Mr. Lopez must have become aware of this, for he has sent his daughter on a visit to the place under the pretext of getting books for him. She was in that room <emph>alone</emph> for several hours, and she slept in the chamber which opens from it.</p>
                           <p>"I warn you that she removed from a niche in the wall a deed that is of the greatest importance to you; it must be recovered at all hazards, for your own interests are deeply concerned in it.</p>

               <p>Inez read these lines over twice, and then folded the paper, and placed it on the table beside her aunt, undecided what defence to make. Finding that she did not speak, Mrs. Hawks angrily cried out:</p>
               <p>"I read guilt in your face. You cannot deny that you have committed this shameful robbery, for it is nothing less."</p>
               <p>"It would not have been <emph>that,</emph> Aunt Eunice, even if I had taken the deed to which this anonymous paper refers; but I did not do it. I declare to you that I brought nothing from Oakland except the books you said my father might have. I have always spoken the truth to you, and I<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6338-00000127"/> do not think you should doubt my word now, because this unknown correspondent has seen fit to accuse me of such an action as that."</p>
               <p>"But I do believe what he says. Your father has more than once insisted that some trumpery writing was in existence somewhere, that would take from me the right to dispose of my fortune as I please. But I intend to show both him and you that I will do it in spite of your contemptible efforts to circumvent me. You have ruined yourself, Inez Lopez, by this last move you have made, for I'll give you a bare pittance. I'll not leave you to starve, because you are the child of my sister, but more than a living <emph>you</emph> shall never derive from your grandfather's estate."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Aunt Eunice; I can have nothing to say to that. Of course you are at liberty to do as you choose with what you possess. I am not mercenary enough to do anything wrong to secure succession to the property that has been so long in my mother's family, and I assure you again that I brought from Oakland nothing, except the books you gave papa permission to send for."</p>
               <p>"Because you found nothing there then. Answer me truly, Inez; were you not sent there by your father on a tour of discovery? Had you not learned by some means the existence of the hiding place spoken of in that letter? Did you not find and examine it, in the hope that papers belonging to <emph>me</emph> would be found there?"</p>
               <p>Thus questioned, Inez would no longer prevaricate. She knew that with her aunt silence would condemn her as surely as the truth, so she determined to speak it, let the consequences be what they might.</p>
               <p>She lifted her eyes to the fierce and angry face that confronted her, and calmly said:</p>
               <p>"You cannot blame my father for desiring to recover the will he has every reason to believe was made by my grandfather father, which secures to me at least a fair portion of his fortune. He learned in a singular manner that a secret receptacle exists in the library at Oakland, in which it was concealed, and he <emph>did</emph> send me thither to search for it. I found the place he described, but it was empty. Some one had visited it before me, and removed whatever had been placed there."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks listened to this explanation in a state of excitement that was frightful to witness. She gasped and struggled for breath, and at length lay back so pallid and exhausted, that Inez expected every moment to see her seized with one of her most fearful spasms.</p>
               <p>She hastened to bathe her face, and to administer reviving drops, and after a long interval of suspense, the angry woman revived, and regained the power of speech.</p>
               <p>"By doing this thing, Inez Lopez, you have sealed your own ruin. I will never forgive you for it—never! I cannot tell if you are speaking the whole truth; but you are a Catholic, and you will not dare to swear to a falsehood on the holy cross I see hanging from your neck. Kneel down here beside me—press it to your lips and swear to me that you found nothing in that recess at Oakland. Do this, or I shall cut you off with a penny. You may starve for all I shall care, after this shameful and underhand proceeding on your part."</p>
               <p>Inez took the plain gold cross she always wore suspended from a black ribbon around her throat, and pressing it reverently to her lips, took the oath required of her. Then, rising from the kneeling position she had assumed, with simple dignity, she said:</p>
               <p>"I have done this, Aunt Eunice, to quiet your agitation, for you are exciting yourself more than is good for you. My father may have been wrong in sending me on such an errand, but he did not think so; nor can I blame him when<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6338-00000128"/> I remember all that he thinks at stake for his only child. You will get over your anger now that you feel assured that nothing resulted from the search I confess to having made."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks regarded her with cold and angry eyes.</p>
               <p>"You speak as if this is a trifle—as if I could find it possible to forgive it; but I shall not. What led your father to entertain such suspicions? How did he learn the existence of a place of deposit I never heard hinted at before?"</p>
               <p>Inez changed color, and after a pause, reluctantly replied:</p>
               <p>"My father dreamed of it, Aunt Eunice. He insists that my mother came to him, warned him of the existence of the recess, and what was concealed in it. I put no faith in his vision, and I deferred going to Oakland as long as possible; but when I found the cavity in the wall which he had so minutely described, I was compelled to believe that through some supernatural means he had been actually warned of its existence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks raised herself on her elbow with dilated eyes and parted lips. She faltered:</p>
               <p>"What is that you tell me? Susie—Susie came to your father, and warned him of what neither she nor I ever knew. It is incredible. Mr. Lopez must have been aware, in other days, that such a hiding place existed. He could never have learned about it in that way. It is impossible."</p>
               <p>"He declares that he never heard of it till the vision came to him. My mother told him that she derived the information from my grandfather, and she bade him send me to seek for what would restore to me what has been so long unjustly withheld from me."</p>
               <p>The last words had scarcely passed the lips of the speaker before she was aware of their imprudence. Mrs. Hawks furiously repeated:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Unjustly!</emph> How dare you use such a word in connection with me? Your mother was disinherited because she stabbed the old man to the heart by her unfilial conduct. He never meant that any portion of his wealth should descend to her child, and I shall take good care that his wishes in that respect are not thwarted. I shall no longer defer making my will, and you may tell your father that his own want of principle is the cause of your being disinherited. I shall leave you enough to live on respectably, but no more; and after what has just happened, I think myself very generous to do even that for you."</p>
               <p>Inez bent her head, but she had no reply to make, and Mrs. Hawks sharply went on:</p>
               <p>"You have no thanks for small favors, I suppose. But why should I expect them from a girl who was so anxious to grasp my whole estate, as to do what you have lately done? Till now, I have hesitated as to the justice of giving my fortune to one who is a comparative stranger to me, but I shall do so no longer. I have sent for my lawyer, and before this day is over I shall make such a disposition of my property as will effectually cut you off from its enjoyment. An annuity for your life shall be secured to you, but nothing more. That is all I have to say, and you may repeat it to your father as soon as you choose. You can call Perkins now."</p>
               <p>"Aunt Eunice, I cannot carry such a message as that to my poor father, for it would kill him. There is no need of telling him of your intentions. He may not live to know that I have been cut off by you for a stranger. He is dying, aunt. He cannot last much longer, I fear; and—and—oh! Aunt Eunice, have you no pity for me?—none for that broken down man, who will never be able to outlive the certainty that his child has lost your favor through his offence? If he had not sent me to Oakland I should<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6338-00000129"/> never have gone, you well know, and he will blame himself as the cause of evil to me."</p>
               <p>Untouched by this appeal, Mrs. Hawks icily said:</p>
               <p>"Your father is slowly poisoning himself with the drug he uses to such excess. If he dies, it will not be because I choose to disappoint his hopes for you, but from the natural result of his own sinful self-indulgence. I have long seen what the end must be, but it is useless to reason with such a man as he is. I insist that you shall tell him what has passed between us to-day, that he may understand and appreciate the evil results of his own conduct. As to Susie coming back to him to reveal the hiding-place of a will that never was made, it is all bosh. In his visits to Oakland, before he persuaded my sister to run off with him, he has pried into every cranny, and discovered the recess in the wall. He had, no doubt, forgotten its existence till a dream brought back its memory, and he thought it best to find out if anything was concealed in it; so he sent you on this shameful errand. That is a far more rational explanation than the one Mr. Lopez chooses to give, and it is the only one <emph>I</emph> shall choose to put faith in. I am tired—I must rest before Mr. Manly comes. Call Perkins, and you can join Miss Gordon in the parlor, if you wish it."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, aunt; I will return home if you please. My father is too much indisposed to do without me long."</p>
               <p>"Umph! jealous, I suppose! Well, you have good cause for it if you only knew all," muttered Mrs. Hawks. She then spoke in a louder key:</p>
               <p>"Do as you will, child; only call Perkins to me before you go. This is the second time I have told you I want her, and you haven't budged yet. I suppose you think as you are not to get any fortune, it doesn't matter whether you do as I bid you or not."</p>
               <p>Inez arose, and after tapping on the door of the dressing-room room, Mrs. Perkins came from it, looking uneasy and irritated. She had heard every word that had passed between her mistress and her niece, and in this first moment of defeat she would think of nothing save the treachery of her young ally; for she felt assured that Nina must have used all her arts in her own interests to have brought such a crisis as the present one.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins silently offered her mistress the attentions she needed; and, after being so summarily dismissed, Inez only paused to say:</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, aunt!" and effected her escape from the room.</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Hawks was comfortably placed upon her pillows, the waiting-woman curtly asked:</p>
               <p>"Will you tell me what that lawyer is really coming here for, ma'am? I hope to the Lord that you were only taunting Miss Inez when you said what you did before I went out. You <emph>can't</emph> be in earnest, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"I shall soon show you whether I am or not," was the peevish reply. "Don't worry me now, Perkins, for I am tired and must rest."</p>
               <p>"You'll soon have time enough to rest, if the good man will let you lie down in peace after you have done such a wrong as you threatened just now. What will you say to your own father and sister when you meet them in the other world, if you've gone and given the old man's fortune to a undermining stranger, and left your own blood next to nothing? Do you think <emph>they'll</emph> take you by the hand in the shining streets of the new Jerusalem, and welcome you with songs of joy? Not they, I guess, after you've done such a crying wrong to the poor child that's just left you half broken-hearted."</p>
               <p>What effect this appeal might have had no one can say, had Mrs. Hawks heard it; but it was scarcely commenced<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6338-00000130"/> when she fell into a slight convulsion, which was followed by the sudden and deep sleep which always followed her attacks.</p>
               <p>While her senses were locked in oblivion, it was dangerous to attempt to arouse her, for if such a thing happened, she invariably fell into one of her most frightful spasms. As Mrs. Perkins looked down on her changed face, she resentfully muttered:</p>
               <p>"If I thought she'd die in the fit, I believe I could find it in my heart to wake her up. But she'd be sure not to die. She'd revive so as to make that will cutting my poor darling off for that deceitful young viper. I wonder how I could have trusted that treacherous face. She aint like Anna Moore for nothing. I know that <emph>she</emph> kept the old man's anger alive against poor Miss Susie, and she did it that the money might all be left to this one. She never liked Miss Susie much, and after all that fuss about the Hastings affair, it is easy to understand that no love was lost between them."</p>
               <p>Although apparently asleep, the consciousness of Mrs. Hawks seemed half-awake, for the name spoken by her attendant struck a cord that instantly vibrated, and she faintly whispered:</p>
               <p>"Anna Moore—Anna Moore—yes, I was very fond of her. We were more to each other than Susie and I, and this girl is strangely like her. Don't you see that is why I am drawn to her,—she brings me back my youth.</p>
               <p>"It is but just; Anna's influence gained me half that I have; so I'll rescue this girl from dependence by giving all to her. I suspect—I almost know who she is, though she does not herself. But what does that matter? I love her as I did her mother before her, and I'll do what I please with my own."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins imperfectly caught the drift of these disjointed jointed mutterings, and she wrung her hands in impotent despair. She felt that she must vent her wrath on some one, and she glided across the parlor, and after a slight tap on the door of Nina's room, unceremoniously entered. She found that young lady reclining in a large chair, reading, for it was yet too early in the day for her to be summoned to her duties.</p>
               <p>Nina laid her book aside, and with her engaging smile looked up at the stormy face of her visitor, and sweetly asked:</p>
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Perkins, has anything happened to annoy you? Your face has a very singular, not to say, sinister expression. I hope that you are not angry with me, for I have really done all that was in my power to carry out your wishes since I have been near Mrs. Hawks."</p>
               <p>The woman shook her finger emphatically toward her, and excitedly replied:</p>
               <p>"You are up to anything, Miss Gordon—you are. You think to come over me now with your soft words, when you've been and done all you could to get around that old woman in yonder, and make her believe that you're fit to be trusted with her money. You've sent Miss Inez to the right about; but I've come to tell you that if my mistress is silly enough to make a will in your favor, it won't be worth the paper it's writ on. <emph>I</emph> know that a settlement was made that gave the estate back to the heir of the Hortons after Mrs. Hawks dies, and that paper shall be found yet if it is above the ground."</p>
               <p>Nina listened to this long address with an air of innocent astonishment. She quietly said:</p>
               <p>"I hope it is so, Mrs. Perkins, for I assure you that I have no wish to deprive Miss Lopez of her inheritance. If Mrs. Hawks entertains such liberal intentions towards me, I was far from suspecting them; but she will think better<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6338-00000131"/> of it. So capricious a woman as she is, can scarcely be relied on. To-day she is offended with her niece, but tomorrow she will be in a good humor with her again. I promise to do all that is in my power to appease her anger, but to do that I must know its cause."</p>
               <p>"As if you hadn't found <emph>that</emph> out already," exclaimed Mrs. Perkins, contemptuously. "Catch a weasel asleep, indeed! I see through you at last, Miss Gordon, and you can't deceive me any longer. You've only been trying to feather your own nest while pretending to be looking after the interests of Miss Inez. You've won the first play, but the odd trick has to come yet, and you shall find out that Miss Lopez will hold the winning card."</p>
               <p>The eyes of Nina flashed, and an expression of superb disdain curled her ruby lip. To look on her then, one would have declared her to be the very incarnation of truth and outraged honor. She haughtily replied:</p>
               <p>"It matters little to me, Mrs. Perkins, who may or may not hold the winning card, as you call it. I only know that I have done my duty by the poor old body of whom you permit yourself to speak so disrespectfully. My heart has been touched with pity for her condition, and if my manner of evincing sympathy has won on her affections, am I to blame for it, I ask you? Mrs. Hawks' niece neglects her, not wilfully, I believe; but still she rarely visits her, and if her aunt contrasts my devotion with her indifference, can you wonder that she prefers me to her? I beg that you will not permit yourself to address me in such a manner again, for I cannot submit to be insulted with impunity. I believe you to be a good woman, and I know you to be an excellent nurse, but even those qualities may be outweighed by the faults of temper you have displayed to-day."</p>
               <p>The cool impertinence of this address actually appalled the irate listener. For a few moments she stood open mouthed and breathless, incapable of articulating a word. Then, with a deep inspiration, she ejaculated:</p>
               <p>"Well, this does beat all! That <emph>I</emph> should live to hear myself talked to in such a way by a slip of a girl that was took in the family but the other day."</p>
               <p>Before she could add more, Nina pointed to the door, and peremptorily said:</p>
               <p>"I will do more than talk, Mrs. Perkins, if you do not leave me without adding to the insults you have already given me. You will oblige me by remembering that I have taken the position of Mrs. Hawks' adopted daughter, and as such, I claim respectful treatment from her dependents. If you wish to retain your place, you must change your tactics toward me, or I will use the power I have gained in a way that will not be very agreeable to you. A word to the wise is sufficient. You can go now, as I think we fully understand each other."</p>
               <p>In the excess of her rage, and astonishment at this calm assumption of superiority, Mrs. Perkins actually left the room without another word. Her tongue seemed paralyzed, and all her faculties in such a state of confusion that she thought it best to retreat, even if there was ignominy in doing so, till she had time to reflect, and arrange some plan that promised to defeat the manœuvres of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Nina Gordon had measured her own strength, and believed her footing too secure to be shaken by her adversary, or she would never have dared to defy her in this insolent manner. Such was the conviction of the waiting woman; but after long reflection on the scene that had just passed, she consoled herself by repeating a piece of wisdom gathered from her own experience in life.</p>
               <p>"It's the long head that wins at last, and that girl is lighter than chaff; smart as she is, I'll be more than even with her yet, smart as she thinks herself."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6338-00000132"/>
               <p>Thus muttering, Mrs. Perkins sat down beside her mistress to fan her, and be at hand when she awoke.</p>
               <p>At the end of half an hour, Mrs. Hawks opened her eyes and asked:</p>
               <p>"Has Mr. Manly come yet? How long have I been asleep?"</p>
               <p>"Not very long, ma'am. The lawyer aint come yet, and when he does, I hardly think you're strong enough to see him to-day."</p>
               <p>At this, Mrs. Hawks flared her eyes open, showing the ghastly white ring around the pupil in its greatest width. She scornfully said:</p>
               <p>"I am quite well enough to do what you have often urged on me. Help me into the parlor, and place me comfortably before Mr. Manly comes, for the sun shall not go down before my will is made."</p>
               <p>"Won't it be better to let your anger cool down before you see him, for Miss——"</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue. Don't call the name of my niece in my presence again to-day; if you do, I'll cut her off with half the annual sum I thought of leaving her. Give me your arm. I don't feel strong enough to walk alone."</p>
               <p>Swelling with wrath and humiliation, Mrs. Perkins bit her lips to keep back the words that sprang to them, and silently afforded the required assistance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks was placed in a large cushioned chair, with a pillow at her back, and she then ordered a table to be drawn near her, on which pens, ink and paper were placed ready for use.</p>
               <p>Nina was then summoned, and Mrs. Perkins dismissed, with orders to call a cab and go to the Glades with the information that everything was prepared for the execution of the will which was to cut Inez off from her inheritance.</p>
               <p>In speechless rage she left the apartment, and no sooner had the door closed on her, than the pretty young hypocrite, who had so successfully carried out her own plans, leaned over the chair of the infatuated old lady, and, kissing her withered cheek, caressingly said:</p>
               <p>"You look better to-day, dear madam; and this cap is very becoming. You don't know how nice and sweet looking you are in it."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, child; don't try to flatter me. In my young days I had some pretensions to good looks, but ill health and mental suffering have destroyed them. I have not been a happy woman, Nina, and to you I owe the little gleam of sunshine that falls on me now. I am deserted and betrayed by my own blood, and you are all that is left to console me. I hope that you really do care for me a little, child!"</p>
               <p>There was a wistful tone in her voice, and Nina hastened to dispel the doubt her words seemed to imply. She kissed the tremulous hands that lay so helplessly before her, and kneeling on a cushion that brought her face on a level with that of her benefactress, she spoke in tones that seemed to vibrate with emotion:</p>
               <p>"Do I care for you a <emph>little?</emph> Ah! dear Mrs. Hawks, be more just to your poor Nina. I cling to you as my only friend; I love you as if you were my mother. Till I knew you I was utterly alone in the world—a castaway, with no position in life, no heart to lean on; but you, in your sublime beneficence, have given me both. Only let me love you as my heart prompts, and you will feel that you have indeed gained a dutiful and affectionate daughter in adopting me."</p>
               <p>She spoke so close to the old lady's ear, that she heard and understood every word of this artful address, and responded to it by saying:</p>
               <p>"I believe it, Nina, and I will this day prove to you how highly I appreciate your devotion. <emph>No one</emph> shall stand between you and me. I will do all for you that a mother could do for her own child."</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6338-00000133"/>
               <p>While Nina was profusely pouring forth her thanks and protestations, a knock came to the door, and Mrs. Hawks hurriedly said:</p>
               <p>"That will do, my love. There is the lawyer I sent for to make my will. Open the door and ask him in, for I am anxious to get the thing done and off my mind."</p>
               <p>Nina's heart bounded wildly. She knew that Mrs. Hawks was furiously angry with her niece on account of her visit to Oakland, and she augured the best results to herself from this sudden determination to execute her last testament while in this state of feeling toward Inez.</p>
               <p>She moved swiftly toward the door, opened it, and admitted a grave-looking man, past middle age, who bowed profoundly before her, and announced himself as Mr. Manly.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks greeted him as an old acquaintance, waived him to a seat, and then turning to her young companion, said:</p>
               <p>"You can go to your own room now, my dear, as I have business of importance to discuss with Mr. Manly. If I should need you, you will be within call."</p>
               <p>Nina promptly obeyed; but, as she told Kitty Bates, she left the door of communication imperfectly closed, and listened to all that passed after the arrival of the lawyer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly stiffly drew his chair nearer to the table beside which his client sat, and spoke in a hard, metallic voice, the peculiar ring of which enabled Mrs. Hawks to comprehend what he was saying:</p>
               <p>"It is many years since we met, madam, and time has not dealt lightly with either of us. But pray excuse me; I forgot that ladies don't like to hear of such changes, so we will turn to a more agreeable subject. Your niece is a very lovely girl, I must say. I have seldom seen so beautiful a blonde."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks' wrath was rising at the supposed praise of Inez, but his concluding words enlightened her as to the mistake she had made, and she graciously said:</p>
               <p>"The young lady who just left us is not my niece, but my adopted daughter; I have sent for you to-day to recognize the claims legally as such, and to execute my will in her favor."</p>
               <p>The man of law opened wide his light gray eyes, and stammered in a perturbed manner:</p>
               <p>"What—what becomes of the claims of your niece, madam? Excuse me, Mrs. Hawks, but I do not think that your father contemplated the possibility that his granddaughter would be disinherited, and his estate left to an alien in blood. You surely cannot mean that the whole of your large fortune shall descend to an <emph>adopted</emph> daughter?"</p>
               <p>"That is precisely my intention, Mr. Manly, and all you have to do is to carry out my wishes, for which purpose I caused you to be summoned here. If my father had designed any portion of his wealth to descend to the child of the daughter he had himself cast off, he would have made some provision to that effect. Since he did not do so, I feel myself at liberty to dispose of the whole estate according to my own wishes. I shall provide for my niece by leaving her an annuity sufficient for her to live on, but the bulk of my fortune shall go to Nina Gordon, the young girl who has just left us. She is far more to me than ever Inez has been."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly listened respectfully, but he was evidently much agitated. He arose, and took several turns across the floor, apparently debating in his own mind what he should say. At length he again resumed his seat, and somewhat huskily spoke:</p>
               <p>"In this conjuncture of affairs, it becomes my painful duty to inform you, madam, of what I had hoped no one beside myself might ever know. There <emph>was</emph> a will drawn up by Mr. Horton himself, and witnessed by myself, and one<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6338-00000134"/> other person, who is since dead. I cannot tell you precisely what it contained, for I was not permitted to read it over, but after it was sealed, your father said to me:</p>
               <p>"'This will secure the succession of the estate to my grand-daughter. I will place it where it will be safe till the time for its use arrives. I will furnish you with a clue to its hiding place which must not be invaded till Inez Lopez attains her nineteenth year.'</p>
               <p>"I accepted the trust, and Mr. Horton gave me a small sealed package endorsed on the back:</p>
               <p>"'To be opened by Roger Manly on the fourteenth of August, eighteen hundred and fifty-one; the day Inez Lopez completes her nineteenth year.'</p>
               <p>"Now, madam, comes the painful and humiliating part of my revelation. That paper, which contained the secret of the hiding place formed for Mr. Horton's last will, has been stolen from the tin box in which it was kept; God knows by whom, for I have no means of discovering. I was naturally curious to know what it contained, and on the very day named, I sought for the package in vain. It had been abstracted; by whom, or for what purpose, I cannot conjecture."</p>
               <p>The two looked at each other a moment in silence; then with a movement of contempt, Mrs. Hawks said:</p>
               <p>"You seem to take remarkable care of the interests of your clients, I must say. Such a trust as <emph>that,</emph> should have been placed where it was impossible for any one to reach it but yourself, and your carelessness is inexcusable."</p>
               <p>"So I believed it was placed, Mrs. Hawks. I have in my office, substantial boxes with patent locks, labelled with the different letters of the alphabet; and in letter H. the papers relative to your father's estate were kept. The one I refer to was among them."</p>
               <p>"And were they the only papers in that box?"</p>
               <p>"No, madam. Howard, Hathaway, Hawkins, and Hopkinson were all in the same receptacle; that is, deeds, &amp;c., belonging to those gentlemen, were there; but I allowed no one access to the boxes but myself."</p>
               <p>"How do you account for the disappearance of this paper, then?"</p>
               <p>"It must have been taken away when I was ill. I had a sudden attack of insensibility while in my office not long since, and when I got over it, I found that my bunch of keys had been left several hours lying on my desk. I examined into my papers as well as I could, but it was some time before I was strong enough to do much. When the fourteenth of August came around, I opened the H. box, and found to my dismay that it had been robbed of the very thing I was in search of. That is the whole truth of the matter, Mrs. Hawks, humiliating as it is to me to confess it."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks meditated a few moments, and then asked:</p>
               <p>"Could any one in the interest of Mr. Lopez have committed the theft?"</p>
               <p>"If that had been so, you would have heard from that gentleman before now, madam; for I am very certain that at the age named, his daughter was to come into possession of a large portion of the estate you hold as absolutely your own. No; whoever took that paper intended to serve his own private ends by doing so, and Miss Lopez will have to pay a round sum if she ever recovers it."</p>
               <p>His client looked disturbed: after a pause, she said:</p>
               <p>"My mind is made up to proceed as if the settlement you refer to had never existed. The clue to its hiding place seems to be lost, so I shall trouble myself no more about it. There are pens and paper, Mr. Manly; write out my will at once, if you please. Here is a list of my bank stocks and city property, which I have had by me for this purpose<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6338-00000135"/> for a long time. My instructions are brief enough, and easily understood.</p>
               <p>"I devise the whole of my real and personal estate to Nina Gordon, my adopted daughter, burdened with two annuities: one of a thousand dollars a year to my niece, Inez Lopez, for the term of her natural life; and the other of three hundred dollars a year to Mrs. Jane Perkins, my maid, on the condition that she will take care of my pet poodle as long as he lives."</p>
               <p>The lawyer deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"But, my dear madam, think of the enormous disparity of what you intend to do for these two young girls, one of whom is the daughter of your only sister. You should, at least, respect the wishes of your father so far as to make an equal division of the estate between them. Upon my word, madam, you have too much money to give, to bestow all on one person. Nearly all, that is; a thousand a year is not poverty, but then, you see, that in justice Miss Lopez should have ten thousand. I suppose that figure is within the half of your income, Mrs. Hawks?"</p>
               <p>With extreme dryness, she replied:</p>
               <p>"You have guessed quite accurately, Mr. Manly; but I decline any further discussion of this question. If you will comply literally with the directions I have given you, I shall be satisfied. But if you insist on bringing forward the claims of Inez Lopez, I must employ some person less interested in her behalf than you seem to be. I sent for you to act as <emph>my</emph> lawyer, not hers."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly bowed, muttered some unintelligible words about natural justice, but ended by curtly saying:</p>
               <p>"I am at your service, madam. Since your mind is made up as to the disposition of your property, I may as well write your will as any other man."</p>
               <p>"Very well—and take care to bind up everything tight and fast; mind that now. There must be no flaw that will enable Mr. Lopez to break my will. Of course he would attempt it if there was any chance of success."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly only replied by taking up the pen and spreading the paper before him. Mrs. Hawks sunk back and closed her eyes, and for the next hour but few words passed between them. He wrote steadily, occasionally referring to the memorandum Mrs. Hawks had given him, which set forth the value of her possessions, and at intervals he cast half pitying, half contemptuous glances at the faded, shaky woman who could derive no enjoyment from her wealth, and vented her spite against her nearest relative by cutting her off with a pittance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly had no personal acquaintance with Inez. He only knew of her existence, and took such interest in her fortunes as a prospective client might inspire; but he dug his pen into the senseless paper with the injured feeling that the girl whose interests he had been especially deputed to guard should be dispossessed, in favor of an utter stranger, of the property he felt certain had been bequeathed to her.</p>
               <p>Who was this Miss Gordon, he asked himself. She looked wonderfully like some one he had known, but all his efforts did not enable him to recall who that person was, till he suddenly remembered a picture he had once seen at Oakland. At this point Mr. Manly suspended his pen and sharply asked:</p>
               <p>"Is not the legatee a daughter of that Miss Moore whose portrait hangs in the room adjoining the library at the old place? I remember now—that is why I mistook her for a relation of yours when I came in."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks seemed a little fluttered by this sudden inquiry. She briefly responded:</p>
               <p>"You too have remarked the resemblance which struck me when I first saw Miss Gordon; but so far as I know,<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6338-00000136"/> she is not related to the person you refer to. There is no reason why I should leave my fortune to a child of Anna Moore."</p>
               <p>Again the busy pen resumed its course; the important document was completed, read aloud to the testator, and declared to be so carefully drawn up that Mr. Manly defied any one to find a flaw in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks was satisfied, and just at this crisis Mrs. Perkins returned from her banishment to the Glades in time to witness the old lady's signature, at which ceremony Dick was called in to assist. The will was then sealed up in a massive envelope and labelled—"The last will and testament of Eunice Horton Hawks, executed the twenty-first of August, eighteen hundred and fifty-one."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins affixed her own signature very sulkily, and she spoke in an aside to the lawyer:</p>
               <p>"You have assisted to do a wicked and unjust thing, sir. Mrs. Hawks is in a passion with the lawful heiress, and has given her fortune away to a pretty flatterer who knows how to keep on her blind side."</p>
               <p>"So I suppose, but there was no help for it just now. Perhaps something may turn up yet that will undo this day's work, and I am sure I hope it will. Mrs. Perkins, I remember you very well, and you hold your own much better than your mistress there does."</p>
               <p>"Thank'e, sir, but I don't vally compliments. If anything can be done for Miss Inez I hope you will do it. You used to be at the old place when Mr. Horton was living; you were a gay young man then, but he had confidence in you, Mr. Manly, and I hope that you won't see wrong done to his grandchild."</p>
               <p>"Not if I can help it, Mrs. Perkins; but just now I can't see my way clear to do much. Light may come, though, when one least expects it."</p>
               <p>He took up the package, and turning to Mrs. Hawks, said:</p>
               <p>"I suppose you wish me to keep this in my possession, Madam?"</p>
               <p>"No, thank you. After the loss you told me of to-day, I think it will be safer in my own keeping. I believe we are through now, Mr. Manly; and, if you will excuse me, I will retire to my room, as I feel very much fatigued."</p>
               <p>The lawyer flushed, bowed stiffly, and was leaving the room, when Mrs. Hawks arrested him by saying:</p>
               <p>"Send in your bill, sir, and I will settle it to-morrow. I always pay as I go."</p>
               <p>"Very well, madam, I shall remember;" and Mr. Manly made another stiff obeisance, and was gone.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks took up the envelope and, assisted by Mrs. Perkins, went to her room. She called for a casket in which she kept her jewels, locked up the will in it, and, summoning Nina to her presence, solemnly said:</p>
               <p>"I have deposited my will in this casket, Nina, as both you and Mrs. Perkins can testify. As <emph>you</emph> are particularly interested in its contents, when I am dead I wish you to remove it yourself in the presence of other witnesses, and—and—I hope, my dear, that what I have bestowed on you may bring you more happiness than it has ever brought to me."</p>
               <p>Nina kissed her in reply, and was about to break into a volume of protestations, when the old lady, overcome by the varied excitements of the day, fell into so violent a spasm that, for a few hours, she was in imminent danger of passing from the scene at once.</p>
               <p>She revived, however; and, when she was safely disposed of for the night, Nina hurried to Kitty's room to hold that conversation which has already been recorded, and, afterward, to take her place in the giddy throng in the ballroom.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN INIQUITOUS COMPACT.</head>
               <p>VAINLY did Inez attempt to conceal from her father what had passed between herself and her aunt. He questioned her so closely that he made himself master of the whole even before Mrs. Perkins arrived at the Glades with the message she was commissioned to bear thither. She remained but a few moments, as she was anxious to be again on the scene of action, to avail herself of any chance to serve the cause of Inez.</p>
               <p>The transports of passion into which Mr. Lopez fell over what he termed the folly and injustice of his sister-in-law, were almost as hard to be borne by the poor girl as the harsh censures of her aunt had been. Every change in her father's face made Inez tremble for his life, for she knew on what a slender thread it hung, yet he would make no effort to control his irritable temper.</p>
               <p>He finally said:</p>
               <p>"We must open a negotiation with this Wilkins, and if he has stolen the will buy it from him at any cost. Ten, nay twenty thousand dollars would not be too much to offer for its restoration. How can we manage to reach him, eh, Inez? We have no one to attend to business for us; no friend who would undertake the affair; so there is no other way than to employ a lawyer to look after your interests. But the deuce of it is, I don't know who to trust to manage so delicate an affair. Roger Manly was your grandfather's man of business, but as he was sent for to draw up your aunt's will, I suppose he has gone over to the enemy; so we must find somebody else."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa," said Inez, "if Mr. Wilkins has really been guilty of committing this theft, it is not to <emph>us</emph> that he will come, but to the opposite party; for he would expect to get a larger sum for suppressing or destroying the deed than we would be willing to give for its recovery. If I judge Mr. Wilkins aright, he will not be satisfied with three times the amount you have named. But, as you suggest, it may be as well to have a lawyer to watch him, and endeavor to find out something definite concerning his share in the robbery. It is my belief that the two men who were in the library that night, are as deeply implicated in it as Wilkins is. He had evidently outwitted them, and my hope is, that their anger against him will lead them to use every effort to thwart him by serving me."</p>
               <p>"That is a shrewd conjecture of yours, and it strikes me that we had better insert an advertisement in the principal newspapers in town, so worded that it will only be understood by the parties concerned, offering a handsome reward for the recovery of the will. What do you say?"</p>
               <p>"It can do no harm, and may do good. I see no objection to it."</p>
               <p>"Then sit down there and write from my dictation."</p>
               <p>Inez obeyed, and the following advertisement was taken by Dick to the newspaper office that afternoon:</p>
               <p>"A very large reward will be paid to the individual who lately abstracted a valuable document from a country house not far from Newport, and no questions will be asked."</p>
               <p>"That will unearth him, if anything will, my dear. And now, let us decide as to who shall be our lawyer. Crampton and Crowder have a good reputation for succeeding in what they undertake. The elder partner is a sharp man of business, I have been told, and he has served me before, for he drew up the deed of transfer when I purchased this property<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6338-00000138"/> erty. I will send a few lines asking Crampton to come out here and have a talk with me. Take up your pen again and write what is necessary."</p>
               <p>The note was written and duly dispatched, and on the following afternoon Mr. Crampton came out to the Glades to confer with his new client.</p>
               <p>He was a rosy, pompous looking man, with an expression of crafty shrewdness in his eyes, which Inez instinctively shrank from. She would have been better pleased if Mr. Crampton had not in any way been mixed up in her affairs, but it was too late now to recede.</p>
               <p>The lawyer listened attentively to every detail given by Mr. Lopez and his daughter, and he shook his head ominously at the name of Wilkins.</p>
               <p>"That's a sharp fellow, sir. Too sharp by far to be caught in a trap set by either you or me. Besides, there is no proof, or next to none, that Wilkins has got possession of the deed; and so far as I can make out, there is no tangible evidence that such a thing was ever actually in existence. Dreams, you know, my dear sir, don't go for much in a court of law. <emph>They</emph> only deal with the hardest kind of realities."</p>
               <p>"But you seem to overlook what was said to my daughter that night at Oakland, by the man who had gone there on the same errand that took her there. What stronger confirmation of the truth of my vision could any one ask than that?"</p>
               <p>"Aye—but, my dear sir, that person will not be forthcoming, I am afraid, any more than the parchment will, though the burglar promised very fairly to prevent Miss Lopez from giving an alarm. I have no doubt that he meant to rob the house, but finding her in the way, thought better of it."</p>
               <p>"So you really attach no importance to what was said on that occasion?"</p>
               <p>"Not much; but I will make a note of it, and of course I shall use my best efforts to serve you in every way that is possible. An estate like this must not be given up without a struggle, and your daughter is the lawful heiress. Who is the girl to whom you believe Mrs. Hawks has devised it?"</p>
               <p>"A Miss Gordon, who is her companion. She is brilliant, handsome, and unprincipled, and in an incredibly brief space of time she has acquired such influence over my absurd sister-in-law, that she can induce her to do anything she pleases."</p>
               <p>"Sharp girl that; she must be worth knowing. I believe I understand the whole case now, Mr. Lopez, and I will return to town at once to consult with my junior partner, Mr. Crowder, as to what is best to be done with reference to Wilkins. He knows him very well; in fact, I think they have had some business transactions with each other, and perhaps Ben will be able to give me some hold on the young man more tangible than any you have furnished me with. Good afternoon, sir; I shall let you know how we progress, and if anything important turns up I will come out to confer with you in person. Your servant, Miss Lopez; be sure that I shall do my best to serve so fair a client as yourself."</p>
               <p>Mr. Crampton politely bowed himself out with these unsatisfactory assurances, and Mr. Lopez and his daughter endeavored to believe that their cause was in judicious and competent hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Crampton softly chuckled to himself as he rode toward Newport, for the idea of sending for so practical a limb of the law as himself to consult with him on claims based on so vague a thing as a dream, struck him as supremely absurd.</p>
               <p>Had he possessed any certainty that the will in question<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6338-00000139"/> had actually been made, his interest would at once have been enlisted, and all his professional acumen been brought in play for its recovery; but he regarded the statement of Mr. Lopez as simply a hallucination caused by opium, which every one who knew anything of him was aware that he habitually used.</p>
               <p>It was late in the evening when he reached his office, and he found young Crowder listlessly drumming his fingers on the arm of a large chair he had tilted as far back as possible by placing his feet on the baise-covered table that filled up half the room.</p>
               <p>He was a good-humored but reckless looking man, and nothing but the tie of blood could have induced the respectable Crampton to retain him in his office. Crowder was his nephew, and he was making such efforts as were possible to train him in habits of business, as yet with very indifferent success.</p>
               <p>He looked around, and in a jovial tone cried out:</p>
               <p>"Hillo, Unk, what's up now? Old Lopez sent for you, I learned from the open note I found on your table. <emph>He</emph> did not write that dainty epistle, I am sure, and as I am half in love with the dark-eyed goddess that haunts the Glades, I have taken possession of it as a precious waif. Any objection, eh?"</p>
               <p>"None—for I have no use for it, Ben. If the young lady could only secure her inheritance, you should be welcome to fall in love with her as fast as you please; but her father sent for me to tell me that there is little hope of that. Such a rigmarole as he told me would make even you laugh, harum-scarum as you are; but I offered your services to verify a dream he has had, to which that villainous young Wilkins is accused of holding the clue."</p>
               <p>A singular change passed over the face of Crowder, and he briskly put down his feet and raised himself from his reclining posture.</p>
               <p>"What's the use of chaff, uncle, when you are talking about business? What do you mean by such nonsense as that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, it isn't <emph>my</emph> nonsense, but that of my new client, for I have undertaken to do what I can to serve him and his daughter. On the strength of a <emph>dream,</emph> they both insist that valuable papers were concealed in the library at Oakland, and they have some vague reason for believing that Wilkins has purloined them. What do <emph>you</emph> think of such an indictment against as sharp a customer as that slippery friend of yours?"</p>
               <p>"I think him base enough to do anything—<emph>anything!</emph>" was the energetic reply; "but, at the same time, he's shrewd enough to secure himself from every attempt to convict him. State the whole case, if you please, sir, for I confess to a vivid interest in it. Miss Lopez has long been my beau ideal of a woman, and I should be glad to serve her."</p>
               <p>"I was not aware that you knew her even by sight, lad. Where have you met with her?"</p>
               <p>"We have not met at all; but I have hunted in the woodland around the Glades, and have seen her out walking. I have sometimes approached the house near enough to hear her singing, or talking with her father, and she has a charming voice for both, sir."</p>
               <p>"Umph! I did not give you credit for so much romance, Ben."</p>
               <p>"I dare say; I am a matter of fact fellow enough, but such a girl as that is enough to turn the head of any man living. But that's neither here nor there; tell me what passed out yonder, if you please."</p>
               <p>Mr. Crampton sat down, and gave a circumstantial detail of what had been revealed to him. The young man listened intently, especially to the account of what had<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6338-00000140"/> occurred at Oakland in the nocturnal interview Inez had described.</p>
               <p>He laughed uneasily, and said:</p>
               <p>"Gad! the girl must have dreamed <emph>that</emph> too. She has evidently inherited the faculty from the old man. On such vague grounds do they really expect to establish a criminal charge against Wilkins? It's all nonsense, sir. It can't be done."</p>
               <p>"That is my own opinion, and I told them as much. But you associate with Wilkins; you are sharp enough when occasion demands it, and I agreed to use you as a sort of detective. If you could find out anything to bring this charge home to him, your fortune would be made. Lopez is ready to pay roundly to get his vision confirmed."</p>
               <p>"I dare say; but it's all moonshine. There is the supper bell, and it is hot enough here to simmer a man's brains. I will do all that I can to serve the cause of my divinity, but I'm afraid that won't be much. Let us go to our boarding-house now, for I am devilish hungry."</p>
               <p>By this time twilight had gathered in the room, and the expression of his nephew's face was concealed from Mr. Crampton. Had it been otherwise, he might have been surprised by the fluctuations in his ruddy complexion, for Crowder was strangely moved by what had been told him. He said to his uncle:</p>
               <p>"You can go on, sir, and after I have shut up and made all safe here I will follow you."</p>
               <p>The elder man strolled away, and, after the shutters were closed and fastened, young Crowder leaned thoughtfully against the wall a few moments, bitterly muttering:</p>
               <p>"I wish my hand had been struck from my body before it did this cruel thing. I have ruined the girl I would most gladly serve; and by the maddest confidence ever given by any fool, placed myself in the power of an unscrupulous scrupulous villain. I must see him without delay—must know on what terms he will treat with me. If he refuses to do what is right, I believe I shall be tempted to choke the life out of him. Hum—Ben. Crowder, that would be bringing yourself to a pretty pass indeed."</p>
               <p>After lingering a few moments in deep thought, he passed out, locked the door of the office, and issued into the dusky street; but he did not turn in the direction of his boarding-house. He struck off into another street, and after briskly walking several squares, entered a crowded restaurant, and ordered supper. He kept an observant eye on those who entered, and just as he was dispatching his last muffin, Wilkins came into the saloon, and sat down to look over the evening paper while waiting for his supper.</p>
               <p>Crowder impatiently waited till he was nearly through with his meal, and then rising, moved toward the recess in which the table of the young lawyer was placed. He laid his hand suddenly upon his shoulder, and spoke in his ear:</p>
               <p>"I have something important to say to you, Wilkins, and I wish you would come with me to your den at once. You see it is an affair that concerns us both very nearly, and we had better talk it over as privately as possible."</p>
               <p>The face of Wilkins wore its usual aspect of white impenetrability, and the man that looked down on him felt as if he would gladly mar the oily smoothness of his complexion by covering it with such a mass of bruises as would have rendered it difficult for his own mother to recognize him; but he smiled in his reckless fashion, and Wilkins replied in his even tones:</p>
               <p>"Ah, Ben., is that you? I hope that you are in a better humor than when we last parted. Of course I will go with you, for we must come to an understanding, you know, and I have something to tell you that I think will surprise you."</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6338-00000141"/>
               <p>"Hem—you've done that so effectually already, that I hardly think anything new in that line will produce much effect. Come on, old fellow; we have both supped, and now to business."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart, for I've got something to say to you that I think you will like to hear."</p>
               <p>Crowder looked incredulous; but the two passed out and walked side by side in silence till they came to a narrow street, down which they turned, and in a few more moments Wilkins paused in front of a door, took a key from his pocket, and opening the way before them, the two entered a small room fitted up as a lawyer's office.</p>
               <p>A table, with a swinging lamp over it, occupied the centre of the floor. Wilkins lit the lamp, pushed a chair toward his companion, and threw himself in another.</p>
               <p>The two men then surveyed each other with a curious kind of scrutiny, and after a pause, Wilkins drew forth a cigar case and matches and offered them to his guest, saying, in his calm way:</p>
               <p>"Take a weed, Ben. What we've got to say can be better talked over in a cloud of smoke, I guess."</p>
               <p>Crowder accepted a cigar, and, lighting it, puffed away a few moments, and then said:</p>
               <p>"You are the coolest customer I ever saw, Sam. Do you know that it is as much as I can do to keep my hands off you, after the infamous trick you played me? Have you thought over all I said this morning, and made up your mind to do the right thing?"</p>
               <p>"If you mean by that, will I give up the advantage I have gained, I answer <emph>no.</emph> My own interests, as well as yours, are at stake, and I don't intend to be bullied into sacrificing them."</p>
               <p>"You don't, ha! Then, by Heavens! I will choke the life out of you, you wretched whited sepulchre."</p>
               <p>He half started from his seat, red and excited, and Wilkins scornfully said:</p>
               <p>"Sit down, Ben.; don't make a fool of yourself, and bring people about us with your loud talking. You would only ruin yourself, and you could bring nothing home to me."</p>
               <p>Crowder sank back with a scowl, muttering curses, "not loud, but deep." He ended by saying:</p>
               <p>"You are a villain."</p>
               <p>"And what are <emph>you,</emph> pray? Don't call me names, Ben. because I don't want to get riled with you above all men. Our interests are identical in this affair, as you will soon see if you will listen to me."</p>
               <p>"No, they are not; and I'll expose you—I swear I will."</p>
               <p>"And what would you gain by that? You would only ruin yourself without being able to <emph>prove</emph> anything against me—don't you see?"</p>
               <p>"No, I don't," was the response, uttered with savage earnestness that was strikingly in contrast with the feline smoothness of his companion.</p>
               <p>Wilkins laughed softly.</p>
               <p>"I am a better lawyer, then, than you are, Ben., and as I am used to stating cases, I will put the points of this one before you. Listen now, and judge your cause yourself. You and Jem Blagdon caught a weasel asleep, or, in plainer words, you found old Manly lying insensible on his desk when you went into his office to try and make some arrangement about a promissory note Blagdon had given one of his clients, who threatened to sue him for the money.</p>
               <p>"Did you try to help the old man? No; so far from that, you locked the office door, took the keys of his strong boxes and searched for the note in—let me see—in letter H. for the debt was due to a man named Hopkinson.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6338-00000142"/>
               <p>"Blagdon secured that, and you, tempted by the d—l knows what, lighted on a paper on which was written, to be opened on the day Inez Lopez completes her nineteenth year.</p>
               <p>"Well, you took possession of that important little package,—with what ulterior views I will not stop to inquire,—you locked the box, left the keys as you found them, and told no one of the condition of their owner. He was found hours afterwards, and attended to by better Samaritans than you or your friend. Isn't that correct?"</p>
               <p>Crowder nodded sullenly, and in the same even tone Wilkins went on:</p>
               <p>"Blagdon made way with the note no doubt; <emph>you</emph> broke the seal of the package you had appropriated, and found within it a diagram of the library at Oakland, the old home of the Horton family, in which a certain spot was indicated where a document most important to the interests of Miss Lopez was concealed.</p>
               <p>"What did you do then? Did you make any effort to apprise her of this fact? By no means; you went with Blagdon to Oakland, and tried to bribe my uncle to leave you alone in the library for half an hour. It was a shallow proceeding, and of course failed.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Then</emph> you had recourse to me. You confided to me what you had done, and offered me a share of the plunder you hoped to gain, if I would aid you in getting possession of what you wanted. I acceded to your offer, and you showed me the diagram. I knew as soon as I looked at it where to lay my hand on the prize, and we agreed to visit the place together."</p>
               <p>Crowder here burst in.</p>
               <p>"And you, like the dog you are, went off at once and secured the papers for yourself. As soon as I heard that you had left town I knew what your errand was, and I followed lowed you as soon as possible. I took Blagdon with me and visited the place in the night to find that you had rifled it. What excuse have you for such treachery as that?"</p>
               <p>"I don't pretend to offer any. It was 'diamond cut diamond,' as the saying goes, and I only foiled you at your own game. I <emph>did</emph> take the will, and I have it now in my possession. I intend to make my fortune out of it, and yours too, in spite of your abuse."</p>
               <p>"In what way? Will you treat with Lopez for its restoration?" eagerly asked Crowder.</p>
               <p>"Not so green as that, old fellow. He would prosecute me as likely as not for meddling with it, for he is a spiteful old fellow. No; I know a better dodge than that; in fact I've tried it already, and made my bargain."</p>
               <p>Crowder opened his eyes to their utmost width, and faltered:</p>
               <p>"I—I don't understand you."</p>
               <p>"But you soon will. I have taken pains to find out every thing concerning Miss Lopez' affairs. Her aunt, who is almost at her last gasp, holds the Horton estate, and thinks she has the right to give it to any one she may fancy. Unluckily for the fair Inez, she has suffered herself to be rivalled in Mrs. Hawks' affections by a pretty girl she picked up somewhere as a companion. The consequence is that she has given her niece the go-by, and actually willed the whole of her large fortune to this Miss Gordon."</p>
               <p>"It is shameful—it must not stand!"</p>
               <p>"But how are you to prevent it? Old Manly was sent for yesterday to make the will, and I called there to-day to collect the fee for him. You know that is my chief business since I commenced practice; and, as Manly keeps no clerk, he often employs me in that way."</p>
               <p>He paused, and Crowder glared savagely on him as he asked:</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6338-00000143"/>
               <p>"How did <emph>you</emph> find out what disposition has been made of the property? Manly would hardly tell you <emph>that.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"But he did though. He was in a great worry about the loss of that trust, and he locked his door, and took me—<emph>me</emph>—ha, ha! into his confidence. He complimented my shrewdness, and told me of a loss he had sustained which involved the interests of a young lady he would not name. But, of course, I knew who he referred to without any assistance from him. He wanted me to help him discover who had robbed him; and went on to state that Mrs. Hawks had made a most unjust will, leaving the whole of her property to a Miss Gordon, whom, it seems, she has adopted.</p>
               <p>"If the Horton will could be recovered, the provisions made by hers would be easily set aside; and he offered me five hundred dollars if I could succeed in gaining a clue to the person who had robbed him. Five hundred dollars! as if <emph>that</emph> was anything to the man who expects to get a cool one hundred thousand for withholding it!"</p>
               <p>Crowder looked aghast.</p>
               <p>"A hundred thousand dollars! What are you talking about, Wilkins? Have you lost your senses?"</p>
               <p>"Not I, old fellow. I am particularly sane and wide awake to my own interests. I tell you the Gordon girl will give me that, when the old lady dies,—and she can't last much longer."</p>
               <p>"How do you know that?"</p>
               <p>"Hum—well, I may as well tell you, for you dare not 'peach. <emph>She told me so herself.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"She—she—Miss Gordon told you that! How on earth did you get within speech of her?"</p>
               <p>"Easily enough, as I'll show you if you will listen to me. Of course I accepted the commission given me by old Manly, and promised to do my best to recover the lost trust. He gave me his bill to collect, and I went at once to Mrs Hawks' rooms.</p>
               <p>"I was admitted, but not to the presence of the old lady herself; she was too much indisposed to see any one, but the young one came out—and such a woman! Ye gods! Miss Lopez is no where beside her, for <emph>she</emph> is shy and proud; but this young queen is as gracious and charming as—as—a woman should be. She has no humbug about her, and I found it easier to talk with her than with any other girl I ever met.</p>
               <p>"She paid the bill readily enough, and I then managed to approach the subject I had at heart, in a cautious manner. But she was ready for me. She had heard of the loss old Manly had sustained,—in fact knew all about it, and she frankly admitted how important it was to her that the Horton will should <emph>not</emph> be forthcoming.</p>
               <p>"I hardly know how we got that far along, but we seemed to understand each other intuitively. Sympathetic natures—ha! ha! Well, to cut the matter short, we came to a distinct understanding; and, when Mrs. Hawks' estate comes into Miss Gordon's possession, I am to deliver up the will in exchange for the sum I have named. Deuced cheap too, when you come to think of it, for the girl will make at least three hundred thousand clear by the operation. I might as well have insisted on having half, for she was at my mercy. Now, do you think that old Lopez would give any thing like that to get the will back?"</p>
               <p>"I—I hardly think he would, because you see it belongs to his daughter, and this other girl is swindling her out of it. By Jove! Wilkins, this is too bad! I did not mean to do any thing so very wrong when I took it. I—I—I've been madly in love with Miss Lopez for months, though I never exchanged a word with her till that night at Oakland; and I foolishly thought that I might induce her to<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6338-00000144"/> think of me if I held in my hand the power to restore her to her inheritance. There—the truth is out, and you may make the most of it!"</p>
               <p>Wilkins leaned back, and stared at him in a sort of amused wonder. He finally said:</p>
               <p>"That's a bad look-out for you, old fellow, for she is engaged to be married."</p>
               <p>"How do you know? Who told you such a thing as that? I don't believe a word of it."</p>
               <p>"It is true nevertheless. I manage to find out most things, but this is no secret. Young Fenton, that magnificently handsome young Southerner, who turned the heads of half the girls at Newport last year, is the man. Miss Lopez has corresponded with him for months, and he comes here regularly to visit her."</p>
               <p>"But her father receives no company. How did he make her acquaintance?"</p>
               <p>"Met her in New York—helped her out of a muss on Broadway; was struck all of a heap, fell over head and ears in love, and for once is, I believe, in earnest, though they say he is a great flirt."</p>
               <p>Crowder looked steadily at him for several moments, and then brusquely asked:</p>
               <p>"Why do you tell me all this?"</p>
               <p>"To bring you to your senses, to be sure. And now let me develop my plans with reference to yourself. I intend to be liberal with you, Ben., for you have been the means of putting this spec in my hands. When my fortune comes in, I will—let me see—I will give you twenty-five per cent. on it, and that will make the neat sum of as many thousand dollars. What do you say to that now? Don't you think it is a prettier windfall than you would be likely to get from the other side?"</p>
               <p>Crowder sat sullenly ruminating for a long time, but Wilkins waited patiently till he spoke in a gruff tone:</p>
               <p>"I've a good mind to blow the whole thing to old Manly; confess, and set him on you."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! what would you gain by that? You would only ruin yourself; bring Blagdon into trouble, and do <emph>me</emph> no harm; for you would have nothing to sustain your accusation against me. No one could swear that <emph>I</emph> took the will from its hiding place, and I shall not be stupid enough to criminate myself. What I say to you without a witness you couldn't bring up against me; so come, old fellow, take up my offer, for you'll never have another that is half as good. Miss Lopez gets a thousand a year, and that is enough for her to bestow on Fenton."</p>
               <p>"If I could only lay my hands on Blagdon, we could, with the assistance of Mr. Lopez and his daughter, made out a good case against you."</p>
               <p>"Ah, bah! What's the use of threats? They don't alarm me at all. Blagdon dare not show his face after stealing that note of his, and making away with it. When old Manly finds out it is gone, he'll be looking sharp enough after him. I rather think that Jem. is on his way to Texas by this time, and he was quite right to get out of the way. You are in the same box, Ben., for you helped him to purloin it, besides appropriating the other. You are booked for the penitentiary if you are fool enough to play the part of the penitent and confess your evil deeds. The world has no pity for an unsuccessful villain, my boy, as you ought to know by this time.</p>
               <p>"Come, old fellow, sharpen up and look on the bright side of this affair. You are devilish hard up, I know, and the cash that will be sure to come to you before long will extricate you from all your difficulties, and leave a handsome surplus after your debts are paid. I am so sure of my quarry that I don't mind making you an advance, for I am in funds just now. I have two fifties in my pocketbook<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6338-00000145"/> book that are at your service, and maybe you can double them before the night is over."</p>
               <p>"Or lose them in that cursed place that is well named a hell," cried Crowder, passionately. "In the real pandemonium I don't believe there can be found a worse devil than you are, Sam. Wilkins, for you are tempting me to connive at the blackest villainy a man can be guilty of. If I assist in defrauding this girl, I shall go down to the dogs at a railroad pace, and you'll drive the locomotive that sends me there."</p>
               <p>"Very well. Let us start on the journey at once, for I am bound to take it, with you for my companion. I can see no reason why it should end so disastrously, though. Twenty-five thousand dollars will set you up in the world again, and with my share of the spoil, I intend to become a gentleman of leisure. I shall cut the law, go to Europe, and play the part of a man of fashion. In fact, I have been thinking of the feasibility of getting possession of the whole fortune by marrying that sharp girl who was so quickly recognized by me as a kindred spirit. If I can only accomplish <emph>that,</emph> old fellow, I'll give you ten thousand more. What do you say to that, now?"</p>
               <p>Crowder regarded him with a dull stare, in which anger and admiration were almost equally blended.</p>
               <p>His astute companion considered him a headlong, softhearted dunce, easily influenced, and once meshed in difficulties incapable of extricating himself from them without assistance from shrewder brains than he possessed. He was reckless in expenditure, an unsuccessful though secret gamester, and the tempter who now awaited his decision, never for one instant doubted what it would be. He knew that bluster as he might, Crowder had no real strength to contend against him.</p>
               <p>After a long pause, he fretfully said:</p>
               <p>"I don't see why you should reap the principal advantage from—from the <emph>fault</emph> I was guilty of. Even if I consent to a division of the spoil, my share is ridiculously disproportioned to yours, for I can't count with certainty on more than the twenty-five thousand. That girl will never consent to marry <emph>you,</emph> Sam, Wilkins, take my word for that."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that. I think my chances pretty good, considering the hold I have over her. I shall make the effort, at any rate, for she pleases my fancy; she's a regular clipper, and no mistake."</p>
               <p>"She's a regular swindler, and nothing less; and if you should force her to marry you to save herself from the consequences of what she has dared to do, she would poison you but she would rid herself of you. That style of woman isn't safe to meddle with, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>The face of Wilkins lost something of its impassive expression as Crowder thus brusquely spoke. He laughed faintly and said:</p>
               <p>"That suggestion merits consideration. Well, perhaps it will be best to let Miss Gordon off safe with the lion's share; but I won't be hard on you, Ben. If you are not satisfied with what I have offered you, I am willing to add five thousand more to your pile. That is nearly a third of what I expect to get; and considering that I have taken all the trouble, and the risk, too, I think it a fair division. What do you say?"</p>
               <p>"I might say yes if I had anything worth speaking of to go on till the old woman dies. I owe five times as much as the hundred you offered me just now, and I shall come to grief if I don't get enough to pay my debts very soon."</p>
               <p>Wilkins reflected a few moments, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I have saved up two thousand dollars, and I will divide that with you now on account, so that you can square up<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6338-00000146"/> and have something left to keep you going till our fortune is paid in. Does that satisfy you, Ben?"</p>
               <p>The tempter knew that this bait would prove irresistible to his needy and extravagant listener.</p>
               <p>Crowder suddenly put forth his hand and grimly said:</p>
               <p>"Needs must when the d——l drives. I don't see anything else that I can do; and, after all, I need not be so anxious to secure a great fortune to Inez Lopez that she may bestow it on another man. Perhaps Fenton won't have her if she loses her chance for the rhino; so here goes, old Sam. Fork over those bills, and give me an order for the balance of the thousand. I'll not ruin myself, and blow on Jem Blagdon to serve a girl who wouldn't care if I was hung to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Wilkins grasped his hand, shook it heartily, and said:</p>
               <p>"That's the right spirit, old fellow. I thought I should be able to show you where your true interests lay. Save yourself in preference to all the rest of the world, for nobody else is going to look after you, I can tell you. Here is the money; but, before I write the order for the nine hundred, you must give me your solemn oath that you will not go back from our contract, and there musn't be any whining around about repentence and all that chaff."</p>
               <p>"I understand; where's the book? I am ready now to swear to anything you may demand. I only hope that the old woman won't be in the way much longer, for I can't afford to wait for my inheritance."</p>
               <p>"Her life isn't worth a month's insurance. She can't live many weeks, for she has fits that get worse, and the doctors say there is no help for her. Here is the Bible—so now, old fellow."</p>
               <p>The oath was taken; the order, to be paid at sight given for the money; and Crowder, with a sudden and characteristic revulsion of feeling, went away whistling a merry tune.</p>
               <p>Wilkins sneered as he put out the light and prepared to leave the scene of their conference.</p>
               <p>"He's gone now to that private gaming-place, and as likely as not he'll be cleaned out again before morning. Well, I can afford to keep him going awhile, for he has made my fortune for me. I wonder if it would be such a risky thing to make that girl marry me now? I believe I <emph>could</emph> do it, for she would not dare to say no, if I threatened her with exposure and ruin. But then she is as sharp as I am, and I have no proof of her agreement with me. All she would agree to was to give me an order with her own hand for a hundred thousand dollars in exchange for the will, when she comes into possession of the Horton estate. Of course she'll burn it as soon as she gets it, and all we shall have to do will be to keep our own counsel. No, I think I had better not play the spooney on such a losing game as that might be, though I'll swear she is the most tempting piece of millinery I ever came across."</p>
               <p>Having thus decided, Mr. Wilkins locked his door, put the key in his pocket, and sauntered away to a favorite haunt of his own, where shilling whist and deep potations were the amusements of the night.</p>
               <p>The more he drank, the whiter he looked, for he was one of those slow-blooded creatures who never flush, and rarely betray excitement. His game was as cautious to the last as it was at the commencement of the orgies; and he arose from the table a considerable winner, as was usually the case.</p>
               <p>The following morning, Crowder informed his uncle that he had been unsuccessful in his endeavors to elicit anything from Wilkins, and that gentleman shrugged his shoulders, and replied:</p>
               <p>"It's just as I thought. A fantastical dreamer, like Mr. Lopez, should not throw groundless suspicions on even so slippery a fellow as sharp Sam."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">NINA GORDON'S TRIUMPH.</head>
               <p>NINA GORDON seemed floating on the topmost wave of prosperity, and she cherished the belief that she would soon be wafted into the safe haven of worldly success.</p>
               <p>Her days were assiduously devoted to the amusement of her fretful charge, for Mrs. Hawks became even more irritable and exacting as her disease assumed its last fatal phase, and her nights were devoted to the excitements of the ball-room.</p>
               <p>Nina found it easy to lead this double life, for it was the duty of Mrs. Perkins to attend to her mistress at night, and her companion of the day was never called on after she retired to her own apartment.</p>
               <p>Since her affliction, Mrs. Hawks had secluded herself from society, and she was not a woman to make or keep friends who would cling to her through weal or woe. So, in spite of her wealth, she was an isolated wreck drifting slowly to the inevitable bourne, and dependent on hirelings for the attention she needed.</p>
               <p>That she had a heart, was proved by the sudden affection she had conceived for the artful young flatterer who had made herself mistress of all her weak points, and played on them for the accomplishment of her own ends; and Nina now exulted in the triumphant certainty that she had almost within her grasp the means of indulging her wildest dreams of splendor.</p>
               <p>The fortune bequeathed to her she looked on as inexhaustible, and she felt as if about to be gifted with Aladdin's wonderful lamp or the purse of Fortunatus.</p>
               <p>The sum Nina had agreed to pay young Wilkins to secure her succession to the Horton estate she thought a mere bagatelle; the large amount that would be left would amply supply her most fantastic wants, and she revelled in anticipation in the splendor with which she would surround herself.</p>
               <p>She thought with pleasure of her free, untramelled condition, for she had something of the wild Bohemian spirit within her, and she joyfully planned wanderings to and fro in which she would consult only her own whims and be accountable to no one for her actions.</p>
               <p>The gay freedom of such a life she could fully appreciate, and Nina panted for the hour to arrive which would place her in a position to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>If that poor, deluded old woman could only have read her thoughts while she hovered so affectionately around her, and examined the traces left day by day of the gradual approach of the grim conqueror, she would have driven her from her presence with execrations. As it was, in her blind helplessness she clung to the only creature who seemed to love her, and surrendered herself to the consoling delusion that one heart at least would mourn over her when she was laid in the last home of all the living.</p>
               <p>Inez now came every day to visit her aunt, but her coldness toward the unoffending girl never relaxed, and Mrs. Hawks took pains to show her how entirely she was devoted to her adopted daughter.</p>
               <p>If this preference wounded her niece, she would not betray it; for Inez was too proud to suffer Nina to see that she keenly felt how much she had lost in being supplanted by her; though she still cherished the hope that something would turn up to enable her to give checkmate in her turn to her aspiring rival.</p>
               <p>The season at Newport had nearly come to a close, and more than half the gay votaries of fashion had already<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6338-00000148"/> winged their way to other scenes of folly and display, but Mrs. Hawks was too much depressed, and really too ill to think of returning to her city home.</p>
               <p>So far as Nina was concerned, her sojourn there had been a brilliant triumph. She had been a "bright particular star" whenever she appeared in public, and the faint cloud of mystery that shrouded her actual position only rendered her more interesting to the outside world.</p>
               <p>Through the agency of Kitty Bates, it was whispered that Miss Gordon would certainly become the possessor of a brilliant fortune on the death of the <emph>relation</emph> to whom her days were sedulously devoted, and this added the crowning halo to the goddess of the hour.</p>
               <p>Hearts were laid at Nina's feet, but their possessors, with a single exception, were destitute of fortune themselves, so she smiled, sighed, and so sweetly declined accepting them, that she made fast friends of her admirers, in spite of the coquetry which had lured them on to a declaration.</p>
               <p>Adolphus Bates was the only one of her lovers who could boast of worldly wealth, and Nina shrewdly suspected that he wanted her prospective fortune to bolster up the business of Bates &amp; Son, as much as he wanted herself. But she played her part with such comsummate tact, that Adolphus soon surrendered at discretion, and became the most devoted of her slaves.</p>
               <p>Nina thought it as well to have more than one resource, and in case anything should happen to disappoint her golden dreams, she could hold him to his pledges as a man of honor, and at least secure the position of his wife.</p>
               <p>As to herself, she did not consider that she was bound by any promise she had made, for she had been very careful that they should not be such as she would find it difficult to break if her hopes were realized in the possession of the Horton estate.</p>
               <p>Adolphus was simply tiresome to her; his family she considered vulgar <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parvenus</foreign> who could be tolerated for the facilities they had afforded her to enter the charméd circle of gay society, but she had really no respect or affection for any of them.</p>
               <p>From this sweeping condemnation not even Kitty escaped, though Nina cherished a faint feeling of regard for the unselfish and devoted girl who thought far more of her friend's success in society than of her own.</p>
               <p>Affairs were in this unsatisfactory condition when a new actor appeared on the scene.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">NEW ACTORS APPEAR ON THE SCENE.</head>
               <p>GODFREY FENTON arrived late one evening at the Ocean House, and took possession of a room which a friend had secured for him. He could not go out to the Glades that night, so after resting an hour, he made a careful toilette, and went into the ball-room to see who among the lingerers at Newport were known to him.</p>
               <p>That letter which it had cost Inez so much to write had never been received by him, so he was in blissful ignorance of all that had lately happened at the Glades. He had left Quebec before its arrival—had travelled rapidly through Nova Scotia, and taken a steamer at Halifax for Boston. From there he came by rail to Newport to visit Inez before setting out for his Southern home.</p>
               <p>Fenton was joyously happy in the prospect of so soon meeting the only girl he had ever truly loved; he was full of animation and gay hopes, and never had he looked more<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6338-00000149"/> magnificently handsome than when he lounged carelessly into the Vanity Fair in which he was wont to play so conspicuous a part.</p>
               <p>The first person Fenton encountered was a young Mississippian, nearly connected with himself, whose presence there filled him with surprise. He eagerly stretched forth his hand to grasp the one extended to him, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You here, Denham! How did you come to stray so far from your native shades? I thought you were so much of a Southerner that you never intended to patronize a Yankee watering-place. I own that I am surprised to find you at Newport."</p>
               <p>The young man to whom he spoke was dark, earnest-looking, with a most interesting, though not regularly handsome face. He was slender and graceful in person, with that distingué air which is more important to one of his sex than mere beauty of feature. He smiled, faintly, as he replied:</p>
               <p>"Nor would you have seen me here now if my own wishes alone had been consulted. I came with my sister who was in precarious health, and her physician thought that the air of this place, combined with sea-bathing, might restore her. I am happy to say that his prediction has been verified, and Anna is so nearly well that we are thinking of leaving next week. You will be coming South soon, I suppose, now that autumn is approaching."</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, perhaps. I do not know; my movements are very uncertain. I shall wait here for letters from home. But I am very glad to hear that Anna is here with you."</p>
               <p>Denham gave him a searching glance, but he carelessly said:</p>
               <p>"I suppose that you would hardly linger here longer than absolutely necessary, when such an attraction awaits you at home. I saw Mr. Hastings' family just before I left Mississippi, and Opal was looking her loveliest."</p>
               <p>Fenton only said:</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed! I am happy to hear it."</p>
               <p>Denham gave him another inquiring glance, and then said:</p>
               <p>"By the way, speaking of Opal reminds me that there is a young lady here who always makes me think of her. They are alike, and not alike, if you can understand that; one is a simple child-woman, with her heart upon her lips; the other a practised woman of the world, who knows how to allure the shyest bird into her net. She is a study to an observer like myself, and I think she is a unique specimen of the sex."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed! I should like to see this <foreign xml:lang="LAT">rara avis</foreign> you have discovered. I pretend to be a connoisseur in women, you know, and something original in that line always piques my curiosity. Can you point her out to me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, presently. She is waltzing now with the young New Yorker it is said she is going to marry. They will whirl this way in a few moments, and I think you may recognize her yourself from her resemblance to Miss Hastings."</p>
               <p>A disagreeable recollection of a face that he too had thought like Opal's came to Fenton, but he mentally said:</p>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> can never be here playing the part of a belle, though she might be a very brilliant one if she only had wealth. I hope sincerely that Nina Gordon and I have parted for the last time. It would be very awkward to encounter her just now."</p>
               <p>While these thoughts flashed through his mind, the dancers swam before his eager eyes. One bright figure, robed with exquisite taste and skill, came floating through the mazes of the fascinating waltz with the grace and lightness of a sylph. She lifted her eye for a moment to the superb form of the young Antinous who leaned carelessly<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6338-00000150"/> against a pillar, and turned them away again as coolly as if the shock of his sudden appearance had not sent an electric thrill through every fibre of her being.</p>
               <p>Nina circled on; but when they reached the farthest end of the long ball-room, she said to young Bates, who was her partner:</p>
               <p>"Let us sit down and talk. I am tired, and my head aches a little."</p>
               <p>He found a seat for her, and smilingly said:</p>
               <p>"This is the first time I have heard you complain of fatigue, Miss Gordon. I am really afraid that you are overtasking your strength by waiting as untiringly as you do upon that old lady, who will not be so obliging as to get out of a world in which she has become a supernumerary."</p>
               <p>Nina put up her hand deprecatingly.</p>
               <p>"Hush, hush, Mr. Bates! pray do not talk so; I cannot permit it. Mrs. Hawks is the best friend I have in the world."</p>
               <p>"Not the <emph>best,</emph> Nina," he whispered, "nor, I hope, the dearest. I am glad that you are willing to talk, for I have a great deal to say to you; and, of late, you seem to evade me when I wish to be serious."</p>
               <p>"Serious," she repeated, in a mocking tone. "If you begin in that style, I shall take refuge among the dancers again. After being shut up with a dying woman all day, and one whose physical sufferings are often terrible to witness, don't you think I need something at night to cheer my spirits and restore the spring to my nature? No, Mr. Bates, no serious conversation for me, if you please. When I need <emph>that,</emph> I will go to the clergyman my poor old friend has had to pray with her since she grew so much worse."</p>
               <p>"You know what I mean, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Belle</foreign> Nina," replied Mr. Bates, in a slightly piqued tone. "I think it is time that we understood our true position toward each other. I have written to my father, and so has Kitty. His reply to both of us came to-day, and he is most anxious to welcome you as—as his daughter. Will you pledge yourself positively to me, Nina? You know that I love you more adoringly than any of the suitors who have laid their hearts at your feet. You have given me hope, but not certainty, and that is what I seek now."</p>
               <p>"How can I give you certainty till we are actually before the altar? Till the irrevocable words are spoken there is time to recede. That is our American code, you know, and I am intensely national."</p>
               <p>She looked up into his face with her bewildering smile; and Mr. Bates was dazzled, though a little angry. He said:</p>
               <p>"It is a poor contract that binds but one party, Miss Gordon, and I make none such. You hold me in honor bound to you, while you assume the right to cast me off if it should suit you to do so. Is not that what your words imply?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know—I am scarcely competent to give an opinion on so grave a subject just now, for my head begins to ache very badly. I can endure the glare in this room no longer. Come on the piazza—let us promenade in the cool night breeze, and I may recover my scattered thoughts sufficiently to satisfy your exacting spirit. I owe an immense debt of gratitude to your family, Mr. Bates; and I do not know why you should think me capable of treating its most important member as badly as you just now hinted I might."</p>
               <p>The tone of injured pathos in which she spoke—the confiding manner with which she clung to his offered arm—disarmed her lover; for, by this time, Adolphus Bates had become so completely fascinated by her graceful wiles as to believe himself irrevocably in love with her.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me," he murmured, "for doubting you for a moment, but when the whole happiness of my life is at<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6338-00000151"/> stake, can you blame me for being anxious to secure your promise beyond recall."</p>
               <p>"Words are but breath," she replied, with a short laugh that chilled his ardor, "and I think that enough has passed between you and me on this subject to enable us to understand each other perfectly. Pray let us talk of something else. I have had so much love made to me in the last few weeks that I begin to feel as if I have been living on a diet of mawkish sweetened water. Not that I place <emph>your</emph> protestations in that category. Ah no—they are the wine of life, Adolphus, and I have quaffed it as the sweetest elixir my soul has ever received."</p>
               <p>The tremulous softness with which the last words were uttered had the full effect she intended. The flattered lover pressed her arm to his side and whispered:</p>
               <p>"Angel of my life, you do well to distinguish me from the rest of your adorers, for I am sincere; I love you for yourself alone, Nina. Before you confided to me the brilliant prospect that is opening before you, I had bowed at your shrine and offered the devotion of my life to the only woman I have ever sought to marry."</p>
               <p>"But not before Kitty had betrayed my confidence," thought Nina, but she only smiled up in his face, and said something in reply that seemed to thrill him with happiness. He lifted her hand to his lips, for they were almost alone on the piazza, and they stood in the soft light of the full moon, talking in the low earnest tones so charming to betrothed lovers.</p>
               <p>Nina was like a sleek and beautiful cat playing gracefully with the mouse she is torturing to death; and try as he would, Bates could extract from her no pledge more definite than those she had already given him.</p>
               <p>We will return to Fenton, who had recognized her with a thrill almost of repulsion, for he remembered their last parting ing and the fleeting interest with which she had inspired him fled before the humiliating truths Nina had spoken to him in that farewell scene.</p>
               <p>But little as Fenton cared for her now, the chilling coolness with which Nina's eyes passed over him and turned away, annoyed him. He had so lately been the ideal of her young heart that his vanity could not endure the conviction that she was already fancy free; that she could cut him as coolly as if they had been no more to each other than ordinary acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Denham aroused him from his unpleasant thoughts by asking:</p>
               <p>"Did you remark the resemblance I spoke of? I saw Miss Gordon look full at you, and you must have noticed her."</p>
               <p>"Yes—the young lady with the Broadway dandy is the one, I suppose. She <emph>is</emph> like Opal, but as you say, the resemblance is only external. That girl has little in common with so pure and unworldly a creature as I know Mr. Hastings' daughter to be."</p>
               <p>"You jump to conclusions very rapidly, it seems," replied Denham, with a laugh. "How could you discover all that by a single glance at a pretty face?"</p>
               <p>"I did not—I make no pretensions to second sight. I have met with Miss Gordon before to-night; I knew her well in New Haven, and I am deeply mystified as to how she came to be playing the part of a belle at Newport. She was then a music teacher in the Academy in which she had been educated. Who is she here with, pray?"</p>
               <p>"With an aunt, or a cousin, I believe. It is some rich relation, I know, who cannot live much longer, and it is whispered that this young lady will inherit from her nearly half a million."</p>
               <p>Fenton's lip curled:</p>
               <pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6338-00000152"/>
               <p>"Then Miss Gordon has discovered to whom she belongs. When <emph>I</emph> knew her she was in profound ignorance of her own antecedents. She had been sent to New Haven almost in her infancy; a brilliant education was bestowed on her, and then she was left to fight her own battle with the world. I am glad to hear that her family have owned her at last. What is the name of this aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Hawk, or Hawks, I don't know which. The old lady is afflicted with epilepsy, and is almost at her last gasp, it is said. But what ails you, Godfrey? You look as if you had seen a ghost."</p>
               <p>Fenton had indeed grown pale to his very lips as he heard the name of Nina's supposed aunt, but he rallied and lightly said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is nothing. I have not been quite well for a day or two, and the close atmosphere of this room affects me. Let us walk out in the open air."</p>
               <p>As they emerged from the door, they saw two figures at the farther end of the piazza, and the young men moved in the opposite direction. They stopped behind the shadow of a pillar, and Denham again spoke of Nina.</p>
               <p>"Throughout the day Miss Gordon devotes herself to her aunt, but at night, after the old lady is safely disposed of she comes forth to charm the hearts of her numerous adorers. I think she is the most consummate flirt I ever saw."</p>
               <p>"Does Miss Gordon really presume to pass herself off as the niece of that afflicted lady? Since you named Mrs. Hawks, I am convinced that this young girl is no more related to her than I am. I know something of her family, and I am perfectly certain that Nina Gordon does not belong to it. What motive she can have for passing herself off as one of them, I cannot fathom."</p>
               <p>"Of whom are you speaking, Godfrey, and why haven't you come in search of your old friend before this time?" asked a clear, feminine voice close at his elbow.</p>
               <p>A slender, dark woman, with black eyes and hair, and a lively, piquant expression, held out her hand to Fenton. The family resemblance to herself and Denham would have proclaimed their near relationship had not Fenton already known her as the sister of his friend. He took her hand, raised it to his lips, and gallantly said:</p>
               <p>"I am enchanted to find you here, Mrs. Langley, looking as well and handsome as ever, though your brother tells me that you have been an invalid."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but that is past and gone. I am myself again, thanks to the bracing air of this delightful place. You have lost none of your gallantry, I perceive, Godfrey, for you flatter as deftly as ever. But my curiosity is aroused. Who were you and Guy so gravely discussing when I came out?"</p>
               <p>"We were speaking of this brilliant Miss Gordon who has turned the heads of half the young men here," explained her brother. "Fenton knows something of her, and he declares that she is not related to the old lady she claims as her aunt."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I have a new chapter of gossip on that subject," was the lively response. "Miss Gordon now appears in quite a new character. She is the adopted daughter of that rich old lady, and will become the heiress to the whole of the fortune."</p>
               <p>"How did you learn that, Anna?"</p>
               <p>"From the lawyer who made the will. Mr. Manly was an old college friend of my father, and he has been talking with me for the last hour. But he spoke of this affair in confidence, remember, and neither of you must repeat anything about it. He is in a great worry about the will, for he thinks it very unjust. He recognized Miss Gordon among the dancers, and pointed her out to me as the young lady who has achieved such success for herself."</p>
               <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6338-00000153"/>
               <p>"<emph>Can</emph> this be true?" asked Fenton, in dismay. "How came Nina Gordon with Mrs. Hawks? and how has <emph>she</emph> dared to set aside the claims of her niece in favor of a comparative stranger? Inez Lopez is the legal heiress, and she is far more worthy to succeed to Mrs. Hawks' fortune than this young adventuress can be."</p>
               <p>"Fie! Godfrey; do not use such a word as that with reference to any lady," said Mrs. Langley.</p>
               <p>"It is the only one I can justly apply to Miss Gordon, cousin Anna," replied Fenton, with some heat. "If such a will has been made, it is a most iniquitous one, and that half demented old woman has been cajoled into making it. I know something of this young girl, and I am afraid that she has few scruples concerning any action that may serve her own interests. How, I again ask, did she come to be placed near Mrs. Hawks? Some enemy to her niece must have done it."</p>
               <p>"I can tell you nothing as to that; but I am under the impression that she engaged herself to live with Mrs. Hawks as her companion, and in that capacity made herself so agreeable to the old lady that she adopted her, and finally settled her fortune upon her. Are you a friend to Miss Lopez, that you take up her cause so warmly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am her friend—one of the few who will stand by her till her cause is righted. I must make an effort to unmask this fair flatterer to Mrs. Hawks. Of course the will can never stand, for the estate comes from the Horton family, and Miss Lopez will be its last representative; but it will be a shame and a disgrace to the memory of her aunt to have such an instrument offered for probate. If I can prevent it, it shall not be done."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley earnestly regarded him while he spoke in this excited manner. She said:</p>
               <p>"You seem deeply interested in this affair, but I am sorry to tell you that Mr. Manly does not agree with you. He thinks the estate must go to Miss Gordon unless a will made by Mrs. Hawks' father not long before his death can be found. The clue to its hiding place has been lost in some inexplicable manner, and if it cannot be recovered, the property devolves to the adopted daughter of the old lady, burdened with an annuity of a thousand a year to the poor girl she has so effectually rivalled. But pray make no use of this information, Godfrey, for Mr. Manly would never have spoken of it had not his mind been so full of it that he could think of little else. Lawyers, you know, do not often speak freely of the affairs of their clients, and Mr. Manly is usually reserved enough; but to-night he could talk of little else than this strange will. As I am unknown to all the parties, and tolerably discreet, I suppose he thought himself quite safe with me."</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Manly the family lawyer?" asked Fenton.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe so; for he spoke of Mrs. Hawks' father and referred to business transactions with him previous to his death."</p>
               <p>"Then he should be responsible for the missing will, and I shall——"</p>
               <p>He stopped abruptly, colored, and, laughing in an embarrassed manner, went on:</p>
               <p>"I am deeply interested in this affair, Anna, for I am well acquainted with both these young ladies. I have the highest respect and esteem for Miss Lopez, and if I can serve her in any way I shall endeavor to do it. You need fear no imprudence on my part, however, for I must proceed very cautiously myself if I would succeed in circumventing Nina Gordon. <emph>She</emph> shall never defraud Inez Lopez of her inheritance if I can prevent it; and I will use every possible means to unveil to Mrs. Hawks the duplicity of which I am convinced she has been made the victim."</p>
               <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6338-00000154"/>
               <p>"You speak very harshly, Godfrey, of this young girl. She is very lovely in person, and all who know her seem fascinated by her. It is strange that you should think so differently of her. Have you learned to know her so well as your words would imply?"</p>
               <p>Fenton hesitated a moment, and then, with an embarrassed laugh, replied:</p>
               <p>"I don't mind telling you, Cousin Anna, for I know you won't bring me into trouble by talking indiscreetly when you get back home. I knew Miss Gordon while I was in college. I was attracted by her because she reminded me of Opal Hastings; and—well, perhaps I flattered her more than was quite prudent, considering my position. You understand what I mean."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley nodded, and Fenton went on:</p>
               <p>"I did not intend to mislead her. We talked poetry and nonsense enough, Heaven knows; but I thought she meant no more than I did. It was a pretty pastime enough for us both while it lasted, and might have ended in nothing serious if the young lady had not discovered that she was to be left to make her own way in the world.</p>
               <p>"She thought I was rich, and—well, the end of the matter was that she rather forced an explanation from me. There was a scene, of course. I said everything I could think of to soothe her pride, for I do not think that any deeper feeling was elicited on her part. But she showed temper enough to convince me that whoever ventures to put her in harness will have a tough time of it holding the reins. I would not be the fellow to do it, for all the money she expects to cozen that poor old woman out of."</p>
               <p>A shadow fell upon the face of Mrs. Langley, and she did not immediately reply. With a sad smile she at length said:</p>
               <p>"Do you expect to become the ruler of your wife when you get one, Godfrey? Any man who starts on his matrimonial journey with that idea is very apt to make shipwreck of his domestic happiness."</p>
               <p>"Rule or be ruled is the question, I believe, and I rather think I shall prefer the former."</p>
               <p>"Then I would not advise you to marry Opal Hastings, for she has as decided a will of her own as any young girl I know. She regards herself as your equal, and if you attempt to make her your slave she will rebel against your authority. You may take my word for it, for I know her well."</p>
               <p>Fenton laughed, and lightly replied:</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I shall take your advice, cousin. The tie that binds Opal and myself to each other was not made by ourselves. It was the pet idea of my mother and her father to marry us when she is old enough, and we submitted to it while we were too inexperienced to know what would suit either of us. We have kept up a fragmentary correspondence, but there is nothing in her letters that induces me to believe that I am more to her than any other friend. I have thought of her as my future wife, with a vague feeling that there was no escape from the entanglement; but I begin to think a way may be found, and I am convinced that Opal will not regret the rupture of our childish engagement."</p>
               <p>"I do not think she will," said Mrs. Langley, with a rapidly withdrawn glance toward her brother, who was leaning over the railing nervously picking the leaves from a climbing plant near him, and he was evidently listening with the keenest interest to what was passing between Fenton and his sister.</p>
               <p>"I am glad that you confirm my own impressions," said Fenton, with some eagerness. He paused abruptly, and Mrs. Langley impressively replied:</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6338-00000155"/>
               <p>"Opal Hastings is a noble, pure, and highly gifted creature; she is far too sensitive and high-toned to be given away at the bidding of any one. Yet her father thinks that he can control the springs of her nature, and mould her destiny to suit himself. Unless she and you love each other with all the strength of heart and soul of which you are capable, you had better risk the severest displeasure of your mother than take her hand in yours as that of your wedded wife."</p>
               <p>"A second Daniel come to judgment," cried Fenton, almost gleefully; "you but echo the convictions of my own heart, Anna, and I listen to your voice as if an oracle had spoken. I have confided my difficulties to you since I was a little fellow, and I find the old habit coming back upon me. I am strongly tempted to tell you what a dilemma I find myself placed in now."</p>
               <p>"I scarcely think that you could do better, Godfrey. Let us promenade together, and leave Guy to dream poetic fancies beneath the light of the moon, while you lay bare your heart to me. You know of old that I will give you the best advice of which I am capable."</p>
               <p>He at once offered his arm, and they moved slowly away, earnestly talking together.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley was ten years older than Fenton; she was the niece of his step-father, had married most unhappily, and was divorced from her husband on the ground of incompatibility of temper. A high-spirited and brilliant woman, she would not submit to the yoke a mean and tyrannical spirit sought to impose upon her, and thus it will be seen that her own bitter experience in the matrimonial lottery dictated the advice she had so lately given to Fenton.</p>
               <p>It had been the habit of his life to confide his difficulties to her, and he now frankly confessed the exact position in which he stood to the two who claimed his troth. She listened with absorbing interest, and when she found herself in possession of all he had to tell, she said:</p>
               <p>"I think that you are bound in honor to release Opal from a tie that can only make you both miserable. If I understand you aright, your heart has been irrevocably given to this young Cuban."</p>
               <p>"True; I adore Inez. I never loved any other woman as I love her. But if her Aunt disinherits her, how am I to marry her? She will have a mere pittance, and I have, as you know, very little independent of my mother. She would never forgive me for disappointing her in an affair on which her heart has so long been set, and she would cut me off without a dollar."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley looked grave, but she presently said:</p>
               <p>"I begin to take the deepest interest in Miss Lopez. That will must be recovered, for it will secure her aunt's fortune to her. You shall then marry her, Godfrey, and the way will be clear for somebody that will suit Opal far better than you could. I will give you confidence for confidence, and tell you that my brother has loved Opal since she was a little girl in short frocks and pantalettes. Guy has been too honorable to betray his passion, knowing as he did the family arrangement that existed between my aunt and her father; but now it is different."</p>
               <p>A disagreeable sensation struck on the heart of the listener. <emph>He</emph> might resign Opal Hastings if it suited him to do so, but that <emph>she</emph> should readily find another to fill the place in her fancy he believed he had so long occupied, inflicted a wound upon his all-absorbing vanity.</p>
               <p>Fenton had long thought of her as one set apart for his own peculiar self whenever he should condescend to speak the word which would bring her to his arms as the sweet minister of happiness to his future life, and the thought<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6338-00000156"/> that young Denham, of all men, should win her heart, was displeasing to him. In a constrained tone, he replied:</p>
               <p>"It seems ungenerous to object to the course you indicated, Anna; but until my fate is definitely settled here, I must not offend my mother by breaking with Opal. It would ruin me at once."</p>
               <p>"Oh, set your heart at rest on than score, for Opal alone shall know that she is free. The denouément can be deferred so far as my aunt is concerned, as it is not expected that you shall marry for a year yet. Opal is too young; and her father intends to employ an accomplished governess for her this fall."</p>
               <p>There was something in her tone that silenced Fenton's objections, though a flush of annoyance burned on his cheeks as he replied:</p>
               <p>"I will leave it to your own discretion, then, to reveal to Opal or to withhold from her what I have confided to you, as you may think best. The night air grows chilly,—had you not better go in? I am afraid to detain you longer lest your health should suffer from it."</p>
               <p>"Which hint means that you are tired of my prosing," she replied, laughing; "so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">allons,</foreign> if you please. Be sure that I shall do nothing to compromise you with your mother, Godfrey; and if I can aid you in any way in your efforts to serve the cause of Miss Lopez, you may command me."</p>
               <p>"Thanks. I shall remember, and perhaps I shall call upon you for assistance. Here is Guy coming to meet us, so I will surrender you to his protection."</p>
               <p>With a nod and a smile, Mrs. Langley took the arm of her brother, and bidding Fenton good-night, they entered the house together.</p>
               <p>Not a word was spoken between them till Mrs. Langley's apartment was gained and the door closed. She then took his hand in hers, and looking into his dark, expressive face, said:</p>
               <p>"The way to happiness is at last open before you, Guy. There can now be nothing wrong in your seeking the love you have so long regarded as the sweetest boon that life can bestow upon you. You have heard what Godfrey said!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," he bitterly replied, "I heard the vain coxcomb give an account of his flirtation with that young girl, and allude to his attachment to another, while he still holds a third one bound to him in such a way as to prevent others from interfering with claims on which he evidently sets no value. To think that Opal—<emph>my</emph> Opal—the darling of my life, should be <emph>his</emph> to accept or reject as may suit his capricious fancy. Oh! it is too humiliating! Yet I thank him for his fickleness; for, as you say, it opens a glimpse of heaven to me. I can win her love—I know that I can, for she trusts me—she has confidence in my truth and honor, and so help me Heaven! they shall never fail her."</p>
               <p>His face grew luminous, his lips trembled, and his sister laid her hand on his burning one. and said:</p>
               <p>"Don't be too hard on Godfrey, brother. I will tell you enough to enable you to see the position you occupy toward each other."</p>
               <p>Denham sat down and listened with vivid interest. At the close of the conference he arose and decisively said:</p>
               <p>"Whatever ending Fenton's affair may come to with Miss Lopez, all is over between him and Opal Hastings. He shall not have the opportunity to play fast and loose with her as he pleases. I shall take care of that."</p>
               <p>"Of course. You are free to act now, regardless of what Aunt Gertrude may think. Well may Godfrey dread her anger; for it will be something terrible when the conviction comes to her that the cherished dream of her life is to meet with no fruition. We cannot leave Newport as soon as we intended, Guy. I must see the play out here."</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6338-00000157"/>
               <p>"There is no necessity for an immediate return. We can remain a month longer if you find it best to do so. I shall be glad myself to know something positive as to Fenton's future prospects, before I go away. I intend to make the acquaintance of that Miss Gordon, and something shall come of it, so good-night."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">AN EXPLANATION, AND A RECONCILIATION.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning Fenton breakfasted with Denham and his sister, and after approving of the change in their plans, he set out for the Glades to visit Inez, and learn from her all the facts concerning her prospective loss of the inheritance he had believed certain to fall to her on the death of Mrs. Hawks.</p>
               <p>He rode swiftly till he came in sight of the old place, and then slacking his rein, he permitted his horse to move leisurely toward the entrance while the rider scanned the door and windows, hoping to obtain a glimpse of the Egeria of the spot.</p>
               <p>Fenton was familiar with the habits of Mr. Lopez, and he felt sure that he had arrived at too early an hour to find him awake, so he should have Inez to himself for a long tête-à-tête. As he drew near the portico, he saw a white-robed figure sitting in the hall, with a brindled cat reposing near her feet in the sunshine that fell through the open door. Inez held a book in her hand, but she was not realing it, for her head was thrown back, and her large, melancholy eyes were fixed on vacancy.</p>
               <p>She did not hear the sound of the horse's hoofs upon the soft turf, and Fenton had dismounted and gained the door before she was aware of his approach. He stretched forth his arms, his face glowing with love and rapture, as his lips unclosed to say:</p>
               <p>"Inez, my angel—my life! Come to my heart. Oh! blessed hour of reunion, this repays me for all the weary days of absence from the light of my soul."</p>
               <p>In the bewildering impulse of the moment, Inez forgot all she had been told, and she threw herself upon his breast with a glad cry of welcome.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Godfrey, my love—my own—how glad I am to see you again!"</p>
               <p>For a brief moment she was lost in the trance of happiness that held her spell-bound as he clasped her in his arms, and kissed her again and again, as he had never before been permitted to do.</p>
               <p>But suddenly she recalled her scattered senses; she remembered the wretched days of doubt and suspense through which she had lately passed, and the flush his ardent caresses had brought to her cheeks faded to a death-like paleness; she struggled to release herself from his embrace as she faltered:</p>
               <p>"This must not be, Mr. Fenton. I was foolish—weak to forget that you can have no right to approach me thus while a doubt of your truth is in my heart. Remove your arm from my waist, if you please; you have not replied to my last letter, and until you have removed painful doubts from my mind, I must treat you as a stranger."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fenton," he repeated. "What does this mean, Inez? Am I not your own Godfrey, as you are my plighted wife? I have no letter from you that I have not immediately replied to. Who has been slandering me to you while I was away and could not defend myself?"</p>
               <p>By this time Fenton had relaxed his hold upon her, and<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6338-00000158"/> she slid from his embrace panting and ashamed, but still as pale as a statue of snow. He saw that she had suffered much—that she had grown thin and wan-looking, and he comprehended that a blow had been struck to her heart of which he was the cause.</p>
               <p>Fenton ground his teeth together, as he mentally exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Nina Gordon has been here! This is her work, but I will yet repay her, the incarnate mischief that she is."</p>
               <p>He gently placed Inez on the seat from which she had sprung on his entrance, and drawing another beside it, sat down and looked searchingly in her face.</p>
               <p>Inez was trembling with excitement, and for a few moments she was incapable of speaking. Fenton took her hand in his own, kissed it with respectful tenderness again and again, and she had no power to withdraw it from his clasp.</p>
               <p>At length he spoke in that deep, musical voice which she believed would have power to recall her from the verge of the grave itself:</p>
               <p>"Inez, darling, best beloved, why do I find you thus when I anticipated nothing but joy in our meeting? Speak to me, love. Tell me what has occurred to dim your trust in me? What was in that letter of which you spoke? I have travelled rapidly to get near you again, and it has failed to reach me. Tell me now, face to face, and see how easily I can scatter every cloud from your mind."</p>
               <p>She eagerly drank in his words; the old spell was upon her, and life and light seemed to return with his beloved presence. A faint flush tinged her cheeks, and her lips unclosed at his bidding:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Godfrey, I have been so unhappy, but now you are here I half forget the cause of my wretchedness; it seems to sink away from me at the mere sound of your voice. Yet—yet it must be told. You are accused of having sought me while bound to another. Are you not betrothed to a young girl in your far distant home? Such is the story I have heard, and, I am afraid, believe."</p>
               <p>"So my precious little wife, (for you are pledged to become such, you know, Inez,) has been listening to some treacherous tongue which has poisoned her mind against me. Tell me the whole story, love, and see how quickly I will remove every doubt from your mind. I am <emph>not,</emph> with my own consent, betrothed to any one save your own sweet self, and I never intend to marry any other woman. My mother has had some absurd plan to unite me with a young favorite of her own, but I have no intention of sacrificing myself to a whim of hers. As to being bound to Opal Hastings, I assure you that we are both free to choose whom we please; for she is scarcely more than a child yet, and cares no more for me than I do for her."</p>
               <p>"Can you forgive me, Godfrey? I should have cast this foul slander from me, and treated it with the scorn it merited; but oh! where much love is given the heart is jealous and exacting, and I—I—oh, Godfrey! I did not know how much you are to me till that cruel girl came hither and told me, with such an air of truth, that you were false—that your exacting vanity led you to woo and win every foolish girl that pleased your fancy, although you were not free to give your hand to any one of them."</p>
               <p>"And to whom am I indebted for this fine character, Inez?" he asked, smiling down into the eloquent eyes lifted to his face, now without a cloud of fear or mistrust.</p>
               <p>"To one who has done me another wrong, Godfrey, for she has won upon my aunt till she has induced her to make her will in her favor, leaving me but a small annual sum from her large fortune. Nina Gordon told me what I have repeated to you, and she accuses you of having been her<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6338-00000159"/> lover; she declares that she had from your own lips the assurance that you would have preferred her to all the women in the world, if she had only been endowed with wealth."</p>
               <p>Fenton's lip curled scornfully, and he defiantly replied:</p>
               <p>"So that scorpion has tried to infuse her venom into your heart, my precious darling; but her sting shall recoil on herself. I will tell you the truth, Inez, and you shall judge me by it. I knew Nina Gordon when I was in college; I admired her beauty, was interested by her conversational powers. She thought me wealthy; and, when she discovered her mistake, she grew bitter toward me. Our flirtation ended in a quarrel, and she vowed then to avenge herself upon me should the opportunity ever arrive. She has availed herself of the first one, regardless of truth. I <emph>did</emph> speak to her of the slight tie that binds me to Opal Hastings, because I wished her to understand that I had no serious intentions toward herself. As to the assertion of my preference for her, I am ready to disprove it by marrying you, although she holds in her own grasp the fortune that should have been yours. Look me clearly in the eyes, Inez, and tell me that you believe me."</p>
               <p>She lifted the snowy lids which had fallen beneath his ardent gaze, returned his look of passionate love, and the happy smile of perfect trust trembled on her lips as they murmured:</p>
               <p>"I believe you, Godfrey, as I believe in the perfect peace that Heaven can bestow, and I love you more dearly than ever."</p>
               <p>The ruby lips were sealed with a kiss, and Inez drew herself back, blushing rosy red at last, for the chilling spell was lifted from her heart, and again her young blood bounded through her veins with all its old buoyancy.</p>
               <p>Fenton possessed himself of her hand, and, after a pause to allow her to recover her composure, he softly said:</p>
               <p>"And now, having made my peace with the fair arbiter of my fate, I must entreat that she will give me a precise account of all that has happened since Miss Gordon invaded the sanctuary of her family, bringing with her discord, and sowing dissensions where peace had formerly dwelt."</p>
               <p>Thus entreated, Inez commenced with the introduction of Nina to her aunt through the agency of the Bates family, and gave Fenton an exact account of all that had since happened, including her own visit to Oakland and the singular confirmation her father's vision had received—though it had resulted in no benefit to her own fortunes.</p>
               <p>Her lover listened with eager interest, and, when she finished, he thoughtfully said:</p>
               <p>"There was a will, Inez. Manly, the lawyer of your grandfather, says so; but, through some carelessness on his part, it has been lost. Your father's advertisement has brought no result as yet?"</p>
               <p>"No; there has hardly been time. It only appeared in the paper a few days ago; but I hope very little from it. I shall have a thousand a year, Godfrey,—this place belongs to papa—so we shall not be absolutely poor."</p>
               <p>Fenton could have smiled at their different estimates of life. To him, with his magnificent tastes, his habitual self-indulgence, the sum seemed almost contemptible. His mother allowed him three times the amount, and, at the end of the year, he was always in arrears.</p>
               <p>But he did not stop to weigh these things now. He was passionately in love with Inez; the chances still remained to her of becoming the eventual possessor of her grandfather's estate; and Fenton was willing to risk something on them. He thought that he would extort a compromise from Nina Gordon, if Mrs. Hawks persisted in her infatuation to the last; though it should be his care to show that deluded old lady of what metal Nina was really made before death placed its irrevocable seal on her unjust act.</p>
               <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6338-00000160"/>
               <p>So he glanced cheerfully around the desolate looking hall, and on the neglected lawn spread before the door, looking even more forlorn than usual in the gorgeous light of the summer morning, and smilingly replied:</p>
               <p>"No—we shall not be poor, Inez. We shall be rich in love; and I have a few hundreds of my own to add to our material income—enough at least to lift me above dependence on my wife. What a charming Eden we can make of this place, love, and for my part, I know that I shall be so happy here with you, that I would not be willing to exchange my Eve for any other woman on the whole earth."</p>
               <p>"And I know that my Adam will be as much to me as the first man was to the companion that God created expressly for him."</p>
               <p>"As I believe he created you for me," replied the happy lover, forgetful in that moment of everything in heaven or earth but the fair creature who hung on his words entranced, and showed in every expression of her speaking face how utterly her hopes of earthly happiness were bound up in him.</p>
               <p>Fenton would not look to future possibilities; he hugged to his heart the present joy in all its fulness; he loved—he was beloved. That should suffice for the passing hour, let future events mould themselves as they would.</p>
               <p>So the moments fled away in the most delicious interchange of thoughts and feelings, and Inez brightened into new life beneath his inspiring words and glances.</p>
               <p>In those golden moments she was crowned with the halo of perfect happiness, a queen over all earth holds that is most sweet and enchanting to the human heart.</p>
               <p>The lovers wandered together in the woodland, and Inez moved beneath the stately old trees, the goddess of love, youth and beauty. Intoxicated by the soul charm of her presence, Fenton thought that even loss of fortune could never induce him to relinquish the hope of calling her his own.</p>
               <p>Through all her after life Inez remembered that morning as the brightest she had known. The love she had vainly tried to conquer sprang to new and stronger life beneath the tender glances and earnest protestations of her lover, and not a cloud of doubt or mistrust remained to dim the radiance of her happiness.</p>
               <p>While it lasted it was as perfect as a dream of Heaven, and she anticipated no awakening from the delicious delusion in which she moved, spoke and acted with the freedom of an innocent nature which, knowing no guile itself, could not be made to believe that it existed in the heart of the man she so adoringly loved.</p>
               <p>The lovers were recalled from that enchanted dream by a message from Mr. Lopez, informing them that he was ready and impatient to welcome Fenton to his home again. Together they approached the house, beaming with love and happiness, and her father, who had been removed to the hall, saw that peace had been made between them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez seized the hand of the young man when he entered, and heartily pressing it, cried out in joyful tones:</p>
               <p>"You are as welcome to this lonely house, Godfrey, as the sun is to the flowers. Inez has drooped without you, and I have missed you every hour of the day since you left us. My daughter has had some jealous fancies put into her head by a tattling mischief-maker, but I see that you have made it all right with her. I knew it would be so, and I told Inez it was all nonsense. The other girl is only furious because she can't secure you herself, and hoped to ruin you with the one you prefer to herself. Eh? Is not that the way of it now, my boy?"</p>
               <p>Fenton laughed and glanced mischievously at Inez.</p>
               <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6338-00000161"/>
               <p>"Perhaps there was something in that, sir. The person to whom you refer did not like the idea of a rival, although she never cared much for me herself. I have explained that flirtation to Inez, and she is satisfied that I have done no wrong either to herself or Miss Gordon."</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes; I understand. So magnificent looking a fellow as you are cannot be expected to escape having a few such affairs of the fancy before the right one comes along to take the heart by storm. I feel sure that Inez has done the last, for I am too keen an observer to be deceived about the genuineness of a man's love for the girl he prefers above all others. I shall bestow my daughter on you without a doubt as to your entire worthiness of so inestimable a gift."</p>
               <p>With graceful warmth Fenton replied:</p>
               <p>"I scarcely know how to thank you sufficiently for that promise, Mr. Lopez. You do me but justice, and I am most happy to receive this expression of your confidence in me. Only give Inez to me as my wife, and we shall be happy together; we love each other truly and exclusively, and on no other foundation can wedded happiness be built."</p>
               <p>"Hear how eloquently he talks!" exclaimed Mr. Lopez, exultingly. "No wonder that he carries everything before him. My dear Godfrey, I think you are a grand man, and a most disinterested one, for of course Inez has told you of the jeopardy her inheritance is in. Nina Gordon has done much more than poison the mind of your betrothed against you, for she has actually found means to rival my daughter with that stupid old aunt of hers. What do you think of that now?"</p>
               <p>"I think it a most iniquitous proceeding, but one that is quite in Miss Gordon's line. She can do what few women would undertake, but sharp as she is, she may meet with more than her match yet. Although I would gladly take Inez without a dollar, I will not stand by and see her defrauded frauded of her grandfather's estate when I feel almost sure that I can find means to convince Mrs. Hawks of the heartlessness and cupidity of the girl she has taken so suddenly to her heart."</p>
               <p>The eyes of Lopez grew brilliant, and he eagerly exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh, my dear boy, if you <emph>can</emph> do this—if you will only undertake to do it, you will give me new life."</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly make the attempt, and I think I shall succeed. Besides, we have two strings to our bow, my dear sir. I have the hope that the deed of which you so strangely dreamed may be recovered. I was told last night, in confidence however, that such a thing actually existed, and Manly, the lawyer of old Mr. Horton, lamented its loss to a friend of mine. If you will empower me to act for you, I will call on him to-day and relate to him the mysterious warning you had of its place of concealment."</p>
               <p>Lopez listened in great excitement. He cried out:</p>
               <p>"Heaven has sent you to our assistence, Godfrey; for, crippled as I am, with no friends near me on whom I could rely, I could do little toward protecting the interests of my daughter. But now they are identified with yours, and you, with your clear head and prompt action, can accomplish a great deal toward seeing her righted. I will give you <foreign xml:lang="FRA">carte blanche</foreign> to act for us both, certain that in so doing, everything that <emph>can</emph> be done <emph>will</emph> be done."</p>
               <p>"You do me but justice, dear sir; and now that this is settled, let us talk over the whole affair quietly, that I may fully understand every point that is necessary to enable me to serve you intelligently."</p>
               <p>Inez had glided away to superintend the luncheon of which her lover was to partake, and in the interval of her absence, Mr. Lopez gave as clear a statement of his daughter's position with reference to her grandfather's inheritance<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6338-00000162"/> ance, as was possible for one whose faculties were in a chronic state of haziness, caused by the drug from the influence of which he was never entirely free.</p>
               <p>This statement, and the one previously given to Fenton by Inez, afforded him a clear idea of the present state of affairs, and his course of action was rapidly decided on. In return for the confidence of Mr. Lopez, he sketched his own programme, and the paralytic was delighted with the promise of success it afforded, provided it could only be carried out.</p>
               <p>Of his ability to do so, the sanguine young lover would not permit himself to doubt, and both were in the gayest spirits when a table was placed in front of Mr. Lopez' chair, and Nora came in, bearing a tray filled with such delicacies as Inez knew would be most acceptable to the fastidious palate of her betrothed.</p>
               <p>The repast was served on rare old china, which was an heir-loom in the Lopez family, and they quaffed their milk from goblets of cut-glass, through which the light shimmered in a thousand prismatic hues.</p>
               <p>As Lopez lifted the innocent fluid to his lips, he said, with a faint sigh:</p>
               <p>"These were made for rare Falernian or Lachryma Christi, and not for the common farm produce which is all we can now afford to drink from them. But I hope it will not always be so, Godfrey. When we have played our play out and won the stakes, we shall once more be able to afford good wine for our friends."</p>
               <p>"This delicious milk is much to be preferred, my dear sir, and I am sure it is better for the health. I rarely take wine, except at dinner, and then a very moderate portion. Young blood needs no such stimulant, and I shall make little trial of its power to enliven the heart of man till age begins to chill the fire that is within me, and custom has staled the things that now bring unalloyed pleasure to me. I enjoy life too supremely to permit my brain to be dimmed and my digestion disordered by the habitual use of alcohol in any shape. But once in my life have I been intoxicated, and I suffered then such anguish of body and mind, that it effectually cured me of all fondness for maudlin pleasures."</p>
               <p>Lopez regarded him with a sigh of envy. That strong and perfect organization needed no artificial stimulant to keep the heart buoyant, the pulses always at an equable beat; but he thought it had always been different with himself. The taint of melancholy was in his blood, and it afforded him some feeble apology for the courses which had ended in making him the miserable wreck he was.</p>
               <p>Inez listened to the avowal of her lover in half incredulous dismay. She impulsively exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Godfrey! I could not have believed that <emph>you</emph> have ever succumbed to such a temptation, even once in your life."</p>
               <p>Fenton laughed at the dolorous tone of her voice, and hastened to explain:</p>
               <p>"You need have no fear of the recurrence of the folly, Inez, for it happened years ago, when I was but a boy. I was dining at the house of a friend, in which drinking was the habit of both master and guests. Liquors of different kinds were pressed on me, and I, willing to be initiated in what I considered manly, accepted them. The result was what my tempters expected. I was carried from the table in a helpless condition and put to bed; but I became so ill that my mother had to be sent for, and a physician remained with me all night. Since that experience, I have been convinced that to a person of perfectly sound organization no worse poison can be offered than ardent spirits. I found out what a great drunk is, and I do not think that I shall ever try it again."</p>
               <pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6338-00000163"/>
               <p>"I am quite sure you will not." And the sweet smile came to her lips, the soft light to her eyes again, and Fenton sunned himself in it with a far more joyous feeling than the rarest old wine could have awakened.</p>
               <p>They lingered long over their luncheon, talking together with that freedom from formal restraint which is only felt among friends who have perfect confidence in each other. Fenton made himself even more charming than usual to both father and daughter, and the sun was beginning to sink in the west before he rose to leave them.</p>
               <p>"I would not go now," he said, "but business must be thought of before pleasure. I shall seek Mr. Manly at once, and perhaps between us we can strike out a plan to recover the lost will. I have reason to know that he is dissatisfied with the disposition Mrs. Hawks has made of her property, and I think he will aid me to restore Inez to her rights in every way possible."</p>
               <p>He pressed the hand of Mr. Lopez; kissed his daughter again in his presence; and mounting his horse, rode away. Inez stood in the door-way watching his receding figure till her father spoke:</p>
               <p>"I told you so, Inez. Godfrey is the noblest fellow living, and true as steel. He will do for us what we cannot do for ourselves, and you will owe the restoration of your fortune to the man you love."</p>
               <p>"God grant that it may be so," replied his daughter, fervently. "I do believe in Godfrey, papa, and I trust him more implicitly than ever. The last few weeks seem like a nightmare of horror to me; you do not know how much I have suffered; but, thank Heaven! it is over, and I can only blame myself for mistrusting the noblest and truest gentleman that lives."</p>
               <p>"You do well to trust him, my dear; for if ever a man truly loved a woman, Fenton loves you. He will marry you whether you inherit your's aunt's fortune or not, and that is something for an heiress to be sure of, if you should turn out to be one. Where is Don Bobtail? It is strange that he never fondles around Godfrey as he does around you and me. What has become of the creature?"</p>
               <p>"Godfrey has an aversion to cats, papa, and he never pets the Don, though he is always kind to him. Shall I call him to you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—you will be dreaming of your lover, and not thinking enough of your game to interest me at chess this afternoon, so I will excuse you, and amuse myself with the cat and a book. Put the last novel on the table, and then you may follow your own devices for a few hours."</p>
               <p>Grateful to him for his thoughtfulness, Inez placed the book within his reach, and then went in pursuit of Don Bobtail. She found him lying in the window of her own room sleeping in the sun, but at the sound of her voice he gravely arose, stretched himself, and marched majestically into the hall. He sprang into his master's lap and coiled himself up, occasionally lifting a paw and patting the hand that held the book as an assurance of affection.</p>
               <p>Inez strolled out beneath the shadows of the trees, and walked through the same scenes that Fenton and herself had loitered among that morning, recalling every inflexion of his voice, and yielding herself more utterly to the absorbing influence he had gained over her than she had ever done in his presence.</p>
               <p>She bowed her head at last and fervently prayed for forgiveness for so wildly loving a creature of human mould, while the love of the Creator was comparatively dim in her heart, but the cry of her spirit was:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father! if I have sinned in this, punish me—not by snatching from me the idol around whom all my hopes have wound themselves. I cannot live without him,—no<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6338-00000164"/> no!—I must cling to him even in death, for the fiat that separates us must bring doom to me!"</p>
               <p>Poor, trusting child! she dreamed not of anything short of death as now possessing the power to sever two so solemnly affianced to each other as she and Fenton were. It did not occur to Inez that it was within the bounds of possibility that <emph>he</emph> would ever recede from his plighted vows; and, as to herself, she could have no doubts.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A PLOT TO UNMASK THE NEW HEIRESS.</head>
               <p>IN the meantime, Fenton rode musingly to Newport, arranging in his own mind the means by which he would unmask Nina to Mrs. Hawks.</p>
               <p>He did not disguise to himself the difficulty of the undertaking, for he was well aware of that lady's aversion to himself; but he would not despair of success, for on the defeat of her rival, depended the restoration of Inez to her aunt's favor, and on that depended the possibility of his future union with her.</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton admitted this to himself with a pang; loving her as he did—pledged to her as he was, he knew himself too well to venture on a union with an almost dowerless bride when his marriage would be sure to offend the mother on whom his worldly prosperity depended.</p>
               <p>Fenton's first object was to see Mr. Manly, and he dismounted in front of a row of law offices, and, looking over the names affixed to the different doors, soon found the one he was in search of.</p>
               <p>The lawyer was within, and alone. A large tin box was open on the table before him, the interior of which was divided into several compartments, each one of sufficient size to contain a considerable number of papers.</p>
               <p>A glance at the box showed the visitor that the letter H was conspicuously painted on the front of it, and he congratulated himself on having made his visit at a most opportune moment. Mr. Manly was evidently overlooking the Horton papers in the forlorn hope of finding the trust hidden away among them.</p>
               <p>He arose, and received Fenton with stiff politeness; he offered him a chair, and then impatiently swept away the deeds over which he had been looking, and turned to his guest as if ready to listen to the business that brought him there.</p>
               <p>Fenton smiled, and said:</p>
               <p>"I must introduce myself, I perceive, Mr. Manly, for you have no recollection of having seen me before. I am Godfrey Fenton, the betrothed husband of Miss Lopez, and in that character I have called on you, as I am told that you have been the legal adviser of her mother's family for many years."</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly bowed gravely, though a sudden grayness swept over his face which did not escape the observant eyes fastened on him.</p>
               <p>"I am happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Fenton," he said, "and I shall be glad to do what I can for you, if you wish to consult with me on that young lady's affairs."</p>
               <p>"I came hither for that purpose, and I think you can do a great deal for me, Mr. Manly. But I must first assure you that I come from Mr. Lopez himself, with full powers to make such inquiries as he is not in a condition to prosecute himself. He has learned from his sister-in-law, Mrs. Hawks, that she has executed a will bequeathing her fortune to a girl not allied to her by blood, and as Mr. Lopez is certain<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6338-00000165"/> that a paper was in your possession which takes from the old lady the right to dispose of the Horton estate to the injury of his daughter, he has commissioned me to call on you, and ascertain if it is safe."</p>
               <p>While Fenton spoke thus, the lawyer could not entirely command his saturnine face. He seemed troubled as well as surprised, and quickly asked:</p>
               <p>"How could Mr. Lopez be aware of the existence of such an instrument as you refer to? Mr. Horton never, I am sure, confided such information to him. They were not on friendly terms with each other, and I do not think that any communications passed between them previous to the old gentleman's death."</p>
               <p>"But you do not deny that such a settlement was made, Mr. Manly? I am fully assured of that fact, as well as Mr. Lopez."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Then what has become of it, for I assure you that it is not, and never has been in my possession."</p>
               <p>Fenton hesitated but a moment. He then looked firmly in the lawyer's face, and replied:</p>
               <p>"That does not tally, sir, with what you confided to a friend of mine. Mrs. Langley repeated to me what passed between you and herself last evening, on this subject, though I must do her the justice to state that she did so with the understanding that it should not be spoken of. To no one, save yourself, and those most vitally interested in this affair, would I have done so; but in a case of such magnitude I could not hesitate as to the course I must pursue. In consequence of what Mrs. Langley told me, I have called on you on behalf of Mr. Lopez and his daughter. I am aware that you are friendly to their cause, and would gladly serve Miss Lopez as far as lies in your power."</p>
               <p>Manly nodded assent, and after a pause, asked:</p>
               <p>"Did Mrs. Langley give you the impression that the will of Mr. Horton was actually in my possession, Mr. Fenton?"</p>
               <p>"That was what I understood, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then you are mistaken. I wish it had been so, for I should then be in a better position to do battle for this young lady's rights. I am warmly interested in Miss Lopez, though I am afraid that I am powerless to serve her. I was, when you came in, giving a thorough examination to the Horton papers in the faint hope that I had overlooked the one which could have thrown some light on this subject. But, during a temporary illness, my keys were lately used, and it was stolen from me; not the will itself, remember, but the clue to where it might be found."</p>
               <p>"This is very strange. Pray explain, if you please, Mr. Manly."</p>
               <p>"Of course I will, painful as it is to me to do so. Mr. Horton was a singular and suspicious man; he disliked Mr. Lopez exceedingly, and he took every precaution to prevent him from knowing that he designed to leave his estate in such a way as would ensure its transmission to his granddaughter. He wrote his will himself, for in early life he had studied law, and concealed it in the old house at Oakland. He left with me a sealed envelope, to be opened on the day Miss Lopez attained her nineteenth year, and informed me that in that I should find the spot indicated in which his will was to be found.</p>
               <p>"That, sir, is the paper that was stolen, by whom, or for what purpose, I cannot understand. I would freely give half my fortune to regain it, for such a thing never happened to me before, and how deeply I feel it, you can scarcely understand. Mrs. Hawks' will is made; I drew it up myself, and there is no hope that justice will be done to her niece, unless I can recover the clue to the settlement."</p>
               <p>"I believe, Mr. Manly, that Mr. Lopez can point out to<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6338-00000166"/> you the place in which it was concealed. Something so singular has occurred, that much as I have hitherto doubted supernatural influences, I cannot refuse to believe in this instance, because they have been so singularly corroborated by what you have just told me."</p>
               <p>The lawyer looked at him as if he thought Fenton was losing his senses, but that gentleman calmly went on:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Lopez <emph>dreamed</emph> of the spot in which the will, so important to his daughter, was to be found; for in spite of Mr. Horton's precautions he knew that something of the kind had been executed. He insists that his wife came to him and warned him of its place of concealment, accurately describing it."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear sir, the will was made after the death of Mrs. Lopez, and she could have known nothing of its existence."</p>
               <p>"True—but the strangest part of it is, that she says her father communicated to her that it had been made and hidden away when they met in the spirit land."</p>
               <p>The lip of Manly curled, and he cynically said:</p>
               <p>"Such a vision as that was worthy of an opium-eater, for such I know Lopez to be. But he will get no man of sound mind to believe it."</p>
               <p>"But you have not yet heard all, sir. Impressed with the belief that what was revealed to him more than once must have some significance, Mr. Lopez sent his daughter to Oakland to examine the library. She found the hiding-place her father had so accurately described, but—it was empty."</p>
               <p>The two men looked each other straight in the eyes, and Manly hastily said:</p>
               <p>"Then the loss of the trust was less important than I believed. The old man changed his mind, I suppose, and destroyed his will. In that case Miss Lopez must lose her fortune; I am sorry for it, but it cannot now be helped."</p>
               <p>"I cannot agree with you, Mr. Manly; for that is not all I have to reveal. Miss Lopez spent the night at Oakland, and slept in the room from which the library opens. In the night two men entered it, in pursuit of the very paper she had been baffled in finding. A light had been left burning in her room; one of the intruders opened the door of communication and discovered that the apartment was occupied. His companion fearing that she might give an alarm which would bring the farmer in charge of the place upon them, spoke to her and avowed the object of his visit to the place. When she spoke in reply he recognized her voice, though his was entirely unknown to her, and called her by her name. He was angry and excited, and accused a man named Wilkins of having been beforehand with them both, in securing what he had gone to Oakland to seek."</p>
               <p>"Wilkins—what Wilkins? There must be some mistake."</p>
               <p>"The man I refer to is the nephew of the farmer who has charge of the place, and he was there the same day that Miss Lopez arrived. He went into the library under the pretext of clearing it of articles belonging to himself, and she saw nothing more of him."</p>
               <p>With some excitement Mr. Manly repeated:</p>
               <p>"It is impossible. Sam Wilkins is in my interest. He is now engaged in trying to ferret out the thief who took advantage of my illness to rob me."</p>
               <p>"Yet this man was certainly there, for he went over on the same boat with Miss Lopez and conducted her safely to the house. He has been partly reared at Oakland, and is familiar with every nook about the house. After his visit to the library he went into the field to see his uncle, and returned to the house no more. Now what do you think of the vision, and the probability that Wilkins stole the will, intending to use it to his own advantage?"</p>
               <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6338-00000167"/>
               <p>Mr. Manly seemed deeply impressed at last by this strange revelation, and after a few moments' thought he said:</p>
               <p>"It is the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of in my life, and might almost make one believe in the reality of spiritual manifestations; but there is one important flaw in the evidence. At the time of my illness Wilkins was not in Newport. He had gone to Boston on business, in which I had some interest, and he did not return till after my recovery. It is therefore quite impossible that he should have been the thief who robbed me of the trust."</p>
               <p>Fenton regarded him with an expression of blank disappointment, for he had made up his mind that the right clue had been found. He asked:</p>
               <p>"Are you quite sure of this, Mr. Manly?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly—for Wilkins had accounts to collect for me in Boston; I saw him a few moments before he left for that place, and within an hour after his return."</p>
               <p>"Then we are left to suppose that some person in his interest committed the first theft; for I am still of the opinion that Wilkins went to Oakland on the day Miss Lopez saw him, for the purpose of securing what he knew to be so important to her."</p>
               <p>"It may be so; but I cannot bring myself to believe it. Wilkins is a steady man of business; he is sure of success in his profession, and I do not see that he could gain anything by such an act as this."</p>
               <p>"That seems a forced conclusion to me, for of course the person to whom the property is bequeathed would pay very high to induce him to destroy Mr. Horton's will. If this Wilkins is in haste to be rich, that would open the shortest avenue to fortune."</p>
               <p>"You may be right, Mr. Fenton, for the young man does not strike me as one who would shrink from any means of bettering his own fortune, though he might hesitate to compromise himself in any way. I am certain, however, that Wilkins did not <emph>himself</emph> commit the robbery, and I have been unable to ascertain who entered my office while I lay insensible. My son, a lad of twelve years, found me alone and gave the alarm."</p>
               <p>"Have you missed anything else from that box? I perceive that other names are on the different packages, and an examination of them may furnish some clue to this mysterious affair."</p>
               <p>"The same idea struck me, and I was endeavoring to ascertain that when you came in and interrupted me. I had examined all the packages except one, and if you will amuse yourself with the evening paper a few moments, I will prosecute my search."</p>
               <p>"Pray do so, but I am too much interested in its result to fix my mind on the news of the day."</p>
               <p>With nervous fingers the lawyer opened the bundle, on which the name of Hopkinson was endorsed in a crabbed hand; and, after a few moments' search, he uttered an exclamation.</p>
               <p>Fenton excitedly asked:</p>
               <p>"What is it? Have you discovered any farther loss?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—a note for five hundred dollars from a man named James Blagdon to Mathew Hopkinson has also disappeared. I am certain it was in this bundle, for I placed it here only a few days before I was taken ill."</p>
               <p>"And this Blagdon—who is he? What is he? and, above all, is he a friend of Wilkins?"</p>
               <p>"As to the last, I am sure he is not, for Blagdon is a dissipated, good-for-naught, with whom a respectable young man like Wilkins would form no intimacy."</p>
               <p>"Does he live in this place? Can we reach him in any way?"</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6338-00000168"/>
               <p>Manly shook his head.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid not. He was notified lately that it was my intention to bring suit against him on this very note that is missing, and he disappeared from the town; no one knows whither he went, for I have caused inquiry to me made for him in vain."</p>
               <p>"Tell me something of him. May he not have been employed by Wilkins to get possession of the trust?"</p>
               <p>"That is impossible, Mr. Fenton; for neither Blagdon nor any other person knew that it had been confided to me. Wilkins would never have bribed him to gain possession of it when he was not aware of its existence. If Blagdon took it, it was only to divert suspicion from himself by removing something else from the box that might be more important than his own note for so paltry a sum of money."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see; but he has evidently let Wilkins into his secret, and he has had shrewdness enough to profit by it. I remember now that Miss Lopez said one of the nocturnal visitors to Oakland was called Jemmy by his companion. The man who spoke to her assured her that the will should be forthcoming in time to save her inheritance, but of course we cannot rely on that. We must take energetic measures at once to right the wrong that has been committed."</p>
               <p>Manly's usual astuteness seemed to have deserted him; he sat staring helplessly at Fenton, shaking his head in a dreary and doubtful manner. He, at length, said:</p>
               <p>"It is easy enough to insist on what should be done, but how are we to set about doing it, is the question. Without more tangible proof against Wilkins than we possess, we could never bring the thing home to him, and he is far too sharp to commit himself. Unless the burglar comes forward himself and accuses him, I see no possible chance to reach him. How little he is likely to do such a thing as that, you can see for yourself, for he would render himself liable to a criminal prosecution for entering the house in the way he did."</p>
               <p>Fenton would not be discouraged. He said:</p>
               <p>"It is not my way, Mr. Manly, to give up the ship till the last timbers have parted. We must fight this battle out to the best of our ability, though we are working almost in the dark. I shall employ a shrewd detective to watch Wilkins, and discover who are his intimate friends. I shall set another on the traces of Blagdon; if we find <emph>him,</emph> we can imprison him on the charge of embezzling the note, and wring from him the information we want in the other matter, as the price of withdrawing the prosecution."</p>
               <p>With a heavy sigh, the lawyer replied:</p>
               <p>"That's all that can be done; but I am afraid that Blagdon will not be found. A few years ago he was in possession of a respectable property, but he has gambled and drank until nearly the whole of it is gone. The note that is missing was secured by a mortgage on the home place on which his mother, a very infirm old woman, lives; and, I am willing to believe, that it was to secure her from being turned out on public charity that he purloined it. He is a reckless fellow, but by no means a bad hearted one. He is his own worst enemy."</p>
               <p>Fenton impatiently replied:</p>
               <p>"Blagdon is a man who will sell himself for money, as most spendthrifts will. If we can only secure him, our side will make it so much to his advantage to give the information we want, that I believe we shall succeed in gaining him over. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Nil desperandum</foreign> shall be my motto, Mr. Manly, for I have everything to gain or lose on the issue of this affair. I adore Inez Lopez, but my mother, on whom I am nearly dependent, will cut me off without a provision if I marry a girl with only a thousand a year. We could not possibly live on that, and, if I relinquish wealth to secure thed hand<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6338-00000169"/> of Inez, it is but fair that I shall obtain some worldly equivalent with it. If she is defrauded of her inheritance, I believe I shall go mad, and—and do something desperate."</p>
               <p>The excitement which Fenton had hitherto controlled now mastered him, and, with flashing eyes and flushed face he arose and paced rapidly to and fro the narrow boundary of the apartment. The cynical expression habitual to the lips of Manly faded away, and he watched the agitated young man with an expression of sympathy and interest not often indulged in by him.</p>
               <p>The lawyer understood all that Fenton's confession implied, and he clearly saw that unless the interests of Miss Lopez were secured beyond a doubt, much as Godfrey Fenton loved her, he would not sacrifice himself for her sake. The acute man of the world, who spent his life in battling for mundane interests, could see nothing wrong in this, and he pitied the lovers over whom so heavy a calamity hung, with all his heart. He more bitterly than ever regretted the illness which had led to such disastrous results; but he could see no promise of success in the warfare that Fenton had suggested.</p>
               <p>The young man at length paused and asked, in a tone of defiant bitterness:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Must</emph> the estate go to the legatee if the will is not found? In making that of Mrs. Hawks, were you not sharp enough to leave some loophole through which the quibbles of the law might creep in and scatter its provisions to the winds? Such things are not uncommon among men of your profession, you know."</p>
               <p>A faint hectic spot came to the cheeks of the lawyer, and with all his native stiffness, he replied:</p>
               <p>"When called on, sir, to act in my professional capacity, I of course drew up such a will as will stand the scrutiny of any court of law. If Mrs. Hawks possesses the right to dispose of the property she holds, it will certainly descend to Miss Gordon unless the will is cancelled or destroyed."</p>
               <p>"It shall not go to her!" exclaimed Fenton, in an excited manner. "I swear that it shall not. You have that will in your possession, of course?"</p>
               <p>Manly flushed, and in a tone of resentment replied:</p>
               <p>"No—Mrs. Hawks refused to allow me to bring it away with me, alleging that the loss of the trust, of which I informed her, induced her to believe that it would be safer in her own keeping."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of that. Mrs. Hawks shall yet tear it up in the fury I mean to arouse in her weak mind against that unprincipled girl; and I sincerely hope that the testator may die before she has a chance to make another. Excuse me, Mr. Manly; but since I am foiled here, I must put in motion the other springs that are destined to explode the mine I will dig beneath Miss Gordon's unsuspecting feet. You know every body in this place, of course, and I empower you to find the detective I wish to employ. Do not grudge money, for I have enough and to spare for this purpose."</p>
               <p>He seized his hat, but the lawyer detained him.</p>
               <p>"Stop a few more moments, Mr. Fenton, if you please, and let us calmly discuss our measures. If we accomplish anything, we must act in concert."</p>
               <p>Fenton again sat down, mastered his impatience, and in a short time a plan was agreed on which Manly undertook to carry out himself, leaving the young man free to act against the invader of the rights of Inez, without being hampered by any other business.</p>
               <p>As they parted, the lawyer said:</p>
               <p>"I shall act as promptly and more cautiously in this affair than you would, sir; for I shall never feel entirely<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6338-00000170"/> free from self-reproach if Miss Lopez is deprived of her inheritance through the loss of what was confided to me. I heartily wish you success in all you may undertake, Mr. Fenton."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; and now I go to beard the lion in his den—in other words, to try and open the eyes of that poor old woman to the duplicity and double-dealing of her would-be heiress."</p>
               <p>"If you are guilty of such imprudence as that, you will lose all. Warn Miss Gordon, and she will be prepared for you. She has possession of the ear and the heart of Mrs. Hawks, and all you could say against her would be of no avail. No, no. If you hope to succeed, you must use other means, and strike when she is least expecting the blow."</p>
               <p>Fenton paused a moment, and then said:</p>
               <p>"That is worth considering. I have thought of two plans, and the most distasteful one will probably be the one I shall at last be compelled to adopt. I will see you again before long, Mr. Manly, and let you know how I am progressing. Good afternoon. I must see and consult with a friend of mine before night. With her assistance, I hope to prove more than a match for Miss Gordon, with all her cunning."</p>
               <p>Fenton hastened to the hotel, gained his room, where he hurriedly arranged his toilette and brushed his hair. Then, in a fever of impatience, he proceeded to the apartments occupied by Mrs. Langley and her brother. These consisted of two pleasant rooms, opening from each other, one of which was fitted up as a parlor, in which was a sofa-bed-stead, occupied at night by Denham.</p>
               <p>He was greatly rejoiced to find her alone; for he had feared that the presence of Guy might interfere with the conference he wished to hold with her on the subject of which his mind was full.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley held out her hand with a smile of welcome, and said:</p>
               <p>"You look very little like a happy lover, Godfrey. I hope that nothing has happened to cause a quarrel between yourself and your new flame, for I have quite made up my mind that you are to be constant to <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Of that there need be no doubt, Anna, for I am more enchanted with Inez than ever. If I lose her I shall lose everything; for, as the French say, I have lost my head as well as my heart."</p>
               <p>"So much the better. I like to see you so much in earnest. What has gone wrong, then, for your face tells me that something has?"</p>
               <p>"It must be a very tell-tale face, then; but you are shrewd enough to read a fellow's heart through every disguise. However, it is not my purpose to attempt to deceive you, cousin, for it is necessary that I shall give you my most unreserved confidence. I hope that you will accept it, and redeem your promise to aid me in every way you can to smooth the road to a speedy union with Inez."</p>
               <p>"I am most eager to do so, Godfrey, so speak out as freely as you choose. I am all attention."</p>
               <p>Her bright, piercing eyes were fixed clearly on his face. Fenton returned the questioning glance, and, with a laugh, said:</p>
               <p>"You are a born plotter, Anna. If you had lived in the days of conspiracies, and been thrown among those who moved the springs of empire, you would have made a name in history. I have come to you now to get you to exert your peculiar talents in my behalf, and I trust that you will not refuse what I shall ask."</p>
               <p>"Thanks for the equivocal compliment; but let that pass, and explain to me what I am to do. You know beforehand that I will refuse you nothing that is reasonable."</p>
               <pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6338-00000171"/>
               <p>"You may not think it reasonable or honorable; but when we have a base adversary to deal with, we must fight her with her own weapons. I'll not mystify you any longer, but state at once that your quick wit must aid me in accomplishing a plan I have devised to expose Miss Gordon in her true character to Mrs. Hawks. Nothing else can save the inheritance of my betrothed to her."</p>
               <p>"That is enough, Godfrey. Tell me what is to be done, and I will aid you with all my power."</p>
               <p>He pressed her hand warmly, and said:</p>
               <p>"You have always been my best friend, Cousin Anna, and I felt sure I should not call on you in vain. I shall proceed at once to develop my plot, and you shall judge of its chances of success. Nina Gordon is an incomparable mimic; she spares no one, and I feel assured that the peculiarities of Mrs. Hawks have not escaped caricature, for the amusement of her intimate friends. Can we not manage to get such an exhibition from Nina, and place Mrs. Hawks where she will be an unsuspected looker on, and <emph>see</emph> herself served up as a laughing-stock for others? That once affected, the will she has made would be destroyed before she slept."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley clapped her hands and gleefully exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I see—I understand. Excellent and well devised; but how are we to overcome the difficulties in our way? Mrs. Hawks never leaves her own apartments except for a drive. She receives no one, and I confess to you that I do not even know her by sight."</p>
               <p>"Where is she located? Anywhere near you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—that much is in your favor. Her rooms are next to these, and that door in the opposite wall goes into her parlor. I can hear the rattle of the dice now, for Miss Gordon spends her days in playing at backgammon or cards with the old lady."</p>
               <p>"Ah, then I must speak more cautiously, for I would not have Nina's keen ears detect my voice in secret conference with you, for any consideration. Everything depends on the mystery with which we shroud our proceedings."</p>
               <p>"Well—yes; and now for the programme. How shall we proceed to obtain the result at which you aim?"</p>
               <p>"The first thing to be accomplished is for you to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Hawks. That will not be so difficult as at first it might seem: the vicinity of your rooms and her infirmities afford you an excuse for seeking her, and I think she will feel flattered by the advances you may make. You can fascinate whoever you choose, Anna; and if you set yourself to work in earnest, you can not only gain the good will of the old lady, but you will be able to win the confidence of Miss Gordon. That will be absolutely necessary to our success, for you must have her in here some evening, with that young Bates and his sister. Nina is easily tempted to mimic any one that is suggested, and if she thinks Mrs. Hawks safely bestowed for the night, she will no doubt consent to serve her up for your entertainment. If you can accomplish this much, I will engage to do the rest. With the assistance of the old lady's maid, who is a fast friend of mine, and was once the nurse of Inez, I think the scales can be wrenched from the eyes of that deluded woman, and Nina Gordon sink to her proper level in the esteem of her benefactress."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley listened with vivid interest. She had no scruples as to playing the part assigned her, for she was so eager to place a bar to the pretensions of Fenton to the hand of the girl her brother loved, that she considered any means justifiable that would tend to that end.</p>
               <p>Besides, she considered Nina Gordon a most unscrupulous girl, who merited the exposure she was so ready to prepare for her. After a moment's thought, she said:</p>
               <pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6338-00000172"/>
               <p>"I have promised to aid you, Godfrey, and I will try my best to do so. But if I am to succeed, you must keep yourself in the back-ground, and permit me to speak of you to Miss Gordon in such a way as will induce her to believe that I am not the warmest friend you have. Slighting remarks with reference to you will probably win her confidence sooner than anything else, and without <emph>that</emph> I can do nothing, you know."</p>
               <p>"Oh! as to that you are welcome to use your own discretion. You may blacken me to the hue of Othello himself, if it will serve any useful purpose, and I shall not care. The day has long passed in which Nina Gordon's opinion of me was of any consequence. As to myself, I will spend a week at the Glades, fancying myself a demi-god while basking in the smiles of my queen of beauty, and listening to the sweet words of the most enchanting nymph that ever cast her spells on mortal man. Oh, Anna, I love Inez to that degree that I shall be tempted to risk everything to make her mine, even if she is so unfortunate as to lose her inheritance."</p>
               <p>"Poor love-sick boy!" she laughingly exclaimed, as she passed her hand through his waving hair with a caressing movement familiar to him from childhood. "Your heart is truly aroused for the first time, Godfrey, and I am most happy that it is so. Opal Hastings would never have suited you, and I am glad that you have found metal more attractive. Guy will make up to her for the loss of such affection as you had to bestow, for he has long and truly loved her. You have no idea what a struggle it has been to him to repress every outward demonstration of his passion."</p>
               <p>"Only help me to restore to Inez the fortune that of right belongs to her, and Guy is welcome to marry Opal as soon as her parents will consent, and also to inherit from my mother the whole of the money my stepfather bequeathed her the power to save. You know Mr. Markland intended that it should be divided between us at her death, but in her anger against me for disappointing her most cherished project, my mother will, no doubt, give Denham the whole of it."</p>
               <p>A faint cloud passed over the face of Mrs. Langley, for he alluded to a family arrangement which had already produced much ill-feeling, and estranged the two young men from each other.</p>
               <p>Fenton's mother had been left a widow but slenderly provided for; when he was in his tenth year she married a second time. Mr. Markland was a man of great wealth, and correspondingly liberal in his expenditure. He had a niece and nephew partially dependent upon him; the boys were near the same age, and both were educated at his expense, with the avowed intention of providing equally for them when they attained the age of majority.</p>
               <p>He died suddenly without adding to his will the codicil that would have ensured this, and his widow came into the possession of the half of his estate, which he had bequeathed to her for her life, intending, it was well known among his friends, that at her decease it should be equally divided between Godfrey Fenton and his nephew. The remaining half devolved to two young daughters then almost in their infancy.</p>
               <p>Though perfectly aware of her husband's intentions, Mrs. Markland made no effort to provide for Denham, but used all her financial ability to create out of her savings an estate for her son that would ultimately place his fortune on an equality with that of her younger children. Guy Denham she retained as the manager of her large estate, with a liberal salary; but nothing further was attempted by her to render him independent.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley had married before the death of her uncle,<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6338-00000173"/> and his bridal gift to her was the handsome portion of thirty thousand dollars settled on herself. Mr. Markland's great fondness for his nephew induced those who knew him most intimately to believe that he would do much more for him than for his sister, and much surprise was felt when it was found that Denham, at his uncle's decease, was left entirely at the mercy of the widow.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley remembered all these things, and with sudden reserve, she replied:</p>
               <p>"We will not speak on that subject, if you please, Godfrey. My brother is the last man to be willing to profit by your disobedience, so far as money is concerned. Your mother will do what she pleases with her savings, and I have little doubt that you will ultimately become their possessor. Fiercely as Aunt Gertrude's anger will rage against you for a season for refusing to make yourself and Opal miserable at her bidding, she will forgive you; for you know that you are the pride and darling of her heart."</p>
               <p>"Do you think it will be possible for her to get over it if I marry Inez with the little that, at any rate, will be hers? She will have a thousand a year, but <emph>that</emph> my superb mother would regard at next to pauperism."</p>
               <p>"I cannot answer for results if you give up Opal with her brilliant prospects, and take to yourself a wife with so small a provision as that. Aunt Gertrude might be obstinate, for she loves money and the power it gives better than any one I have ever known; but we will not consider that phase of the affair, for I have made up my mind that we will put Miss Gordon to rout, and reinstate your lady-love in the good graces of her rich relative, who shall reward the service you intend to render her by consenting to your marriage with her niece, and endowing her with the whole of her fortune. Nothing less will compensate me for the trouble I am going to take."</p>
               <p>"I only hope that you will meet with so just a reward, Anna. I know that I shall thank you and bless you as the savior of my happiness if you can succeed; and now, I believe we fully understand each other. I will make my arrangements to remove to the Glades to-morrow, and every evening I will come in to hear of the progress you are making in gaining the confidence of Mrs. Hawks and her protégée. I must leave you now to seek an interview with Mrs. Perkins, and initiate her into our plans. She is devoted to the interests of Inez, and she will not fail to second us with all her heart. I will write you a few lines informing you of the result of my conference with her. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir,</foreign> my charming cousin."</p>
               <p>He lifted the hand Mrs. Langley extended to him, gallantly to his lips, and bowing low over it, left the room.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley laughed softly to herself as the door closed upon him, and after musing a few moments, words broke unconsciously from her lips.</p>
               <p>"Godfrey is just what he was in boyhood. Eager in pursuit of what interests him at the moment; careless of results to others, provided he grasps his own quarry. Well, such as he is, I love him now as I did when he was a little lad, and I will serve him in this affair with all the wit that I possess. That girl merits exposure, so why should I feel any shrinking at the thought of what we have planned? If I fail to win her confidence, and carry out our plot to a successful issue, it will be the first time I have ever failed in anything I have set my heart on.</p>
               <p>"But my brother must not know what is going on. With his fastidious sense of honor, he would never consent that I should attempt such a thing, vitally as he is interested in getting Godfrey out of the way with Opal. Darling girl that she is, she will be far, far happier and safer with Guy than with such a man as Godfrey. Mr. Hastings<pb n="362-363" xml:id="VAC6338-00000174"/> will not thank me any more than Aunt Gertrude, but to that I am indifferent."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley reclined on her sofa, her subtle brain arranging the acts of the comedy in which she was about to play so conspicuous a part, till her brother came in to take her down to supper.</p>
               <p>She told him of the call she had received, and informed him that Fenton was going into the country to spend a week with some friends. Denham received the announcement indifferently, and did not even inquire to whom the visit was to be made, nor did she give a hint of the promise she had made to him, or her firm resolution to keep it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A CODICIL IS ADDED TO MRS. HAWKS' WILL.</head>
               <p>ON the same night the first advance of Mrs. Langley was made toward an acquaintance with Miss Gordon.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bates had more than once manœuvred to obtain an introduction to the elegant Southerner who was rumored to belong to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">crême de la crême</foreign> of her native State, and wealthy as the merchant was, his wife had a most plebeian desire to cultivate the acquaintance of aristocratic people.</p>
               <p>The vivacity of Mrs. Langley, aided by the report that she was the possessor of a large fortune, had rendered her an object of much attraction since the restoration of her health enabled her to make her appearance among the gay throng assembled at the Ocean House; but hitherto she had confined her associations to a pleasant clique of Southern people, and until this night she had shown no inclination to mingle with others.</p>
               <p>Miss Gordon made her appearance at a late hour, accompanied, as usual, by the Bates party. After dancing the German, she went into the music room at the solicitation of several of her adorers, to play and sing for them.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley strolled into the room on the arm of a New Yorker who ranked himself among her admirers, and at a whispered request from her, he presented her to Mrs. Bates, who in turn introduced her to her son and Miss Gordon.</p>
               <p>Nina gave her a penetrating glance, for she had seen her conversing familiarly with Godfrey Fenton on the previous night, and was inclined to mistrust her on that account.</p>
               <p>But the frank, sweet smile on the lips of Mrs. Langley disarmed her suspicions, and the few graceful words she addressed to her, gave Nina the impression that it was the desire of the fascinating stranger to cultivate her acquaintance which led her to seek an introduction to the party.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley presently said:</p>
               <p>"You will sing for us, Miss Gordon. I have before listened to you with delight, for your voice is one of rare sweetness, and you manage it with extreme skill. I adore music, though I am but an indifferent performer myself, and I absolutely cannot sing a note."</p>
               <p>Nina smiled brightly, flattered and elated by such words from the exclusive Southerner, and she at once took her place at the piano, with Mr. Bates stationed at her side in readiness to turn over the music.</p>
               <p>Adolphus was in gorgeous array, and looked as pompous and important as any Broadway dandy could under such gratifying circumstances.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful Venice" was then in the zenith of its popularity, and that was the song that happened to be on the music stand. Nina struck into the melody at once, her soft soprano voice doing as much justice to it as it was susceptible<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6338-00000175"/> ceptible of, and the little knot of listeners were duly enraptured with the performance. She gave the French pronunciation to the name of the city of the sea, and the unlucky Adolphus, wishing to make an impression on the bright-eyed stranger who had joined them, threw himself back and in his most pompous tone said:</p>
               <p>"Beautiful <emph>Venus</emph>—yes, you are quite right, Miss Nina. Venus was born of the sea, and a lovely song that is which celebrates her charms. But goddess as she was, she was scarcely more fair than her who has so charmingly sung about her."</p>
               <p>Nina flashed at him a single glance of angry annoyance at his absurd blunder, and he hastily whispered:</p>
               <p>"What have I said—what have I done to merit so scathing a look as that? My dear Nina, you absolutely petrify me."</p>
               <p>She deigned no reply, and Kitty, who had joined them, whispered in his ear:</p>
               <p>"Don't make a goose of yourself, Dolly. Venice is an Italian city; I wish you had learned a little more of geography than you seem to know. If you had looked at the words of the song, you could not have made such a ridiculous blunder."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates angrily retorted in the same tone:</p>
               <p>"Geography be hanged! I won't be bullied by you, nor frowned on by my betrothed, if I did make a little mistake," and he turned sulkily away and left the room."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley, with the perfect tact that was a part of her nature, turned to Mrs. Bates and glided into conversation, managing to bring both the young girls to her side, charmed listeners to the sprightly and graceful nothings she invested with an interest they could scarcely have boasted of in themselves.</p>
               <p>To Nina she finally addressed herself:</p>
               <p>"I have desired for some time to make your acquaintance, Miss Gordon, for you have inspired me with much interest. I have lately heard something of your early history from a friend of mine. Godfrey Fenton spoke of you as one he had known and admired, and I determined to make an effort to approach you more nearly. I trust that now I have done so, you will meet me at least half way."</p>
               <p>The sudden light that flashed into the face of the girl; the tremor that thrilled through her voice when she replied, convinced the acute Mrs. Langley that the flirtation of which Fenton had so lightly spoken had left deeper traces in this heart than in his own fickle one. She asked in a faint voice:</p>
               <p>"What did Mr. Fenton say of me that could interest you in me? I—I scarcely expected such a service at his hands."</p>
               <p>"And why not, Miss Gordon? Godfrey Fenton avowed his former admiration for you, and I think he was wounded last night when you refused to recognize him in the ballroom. He spoke of it to me soon afterward."</p>
               <p>The fluctuations in Nina's complexion were marvellous in a person so self-controlled as she ordinarily was; but throughout that day a struggle had been going on in her heart between pride and outraged love; the sight of Fenton had brought back that bitter past so vividly that she almost doubted the victory she thought she had gained over herself. Coldly as her eyes had passed over his face, she would, in that first moment of recognition, have cast herself at his feet and implored to be taken to his heart again—to be tolerated, and her devotion accepted, even if not loved as a wife should be.</p>
               <p>All that day, while engaged in playing the wearisome games in which the soul of Mrs. Hawks delighted, Nina had thought only of him and the chances in her favor when<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6338-00000176"/> she became the actual possessor of the wealth she had thus far so successfully angled for.</p>
               <p>Yes, proud as she was by nature, Nina Gordon felt that she would be willing to <emph>purchase</emph> the hand of the man who had once cast her off, leaving her to despair. She recalled his words uttered long ago, and she laid the flattering unction to her soul that she had been really and truly beloved by him: had she <emph>then</emph> possessed what was almost within her grasp now, Fenton would have acted very differently.</p>
               <p>When the wealth of Mrs. Hawks came actually into her possession, what might he not be tempted to do? Her soul revelled anew in the possibilities that opened before her. Hope again sprung into being beneath the words of this stranger who was <emph>his</emph> friend, yet had been induced by his praises of herself to seek her acquaintance.</p>
               <p>As these thoughts flashed, lightning-like, through her mind, she raised her eyes to the darkly bright face that was curiously scanning her, and softly said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, I once thought Godfrey Fenton a noble man, but he taught me a little lesson, and one I am not likely to forget. Since you are <emph>his</emph> friend, Mrs. Langley, I will say nothing of the causes that led to our estrangement, for they would certainly reflect little credit on him. I have forgiven him; I had in a measure forgotten him, when he appeared so suddenly before me last night—so let that suffice."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley bowed; made no further effort to pursue the subject, and again turned to Mrs. Bates, and talked on in her lively, piquant manner. When she at length arose to retire, she said to the ladies:</p>
               <p>"I hope you will all call on me in my private parlor and give me an opportunity of silencing my own people when they say that Northern women are less social and agreeable than Southern. I am sure that I have been charmed to-night, and I venture to hope that you two young ladies will take pity on my loneliness and come often to my room. Ah, I forgot! you, Miss Gordon, in the goodness of your heart, devote yourself to that poor invalid whose parlor joins mine. If you can persuade Mrs. Hawks to let me come into her room occasionally, I will endeavor to lighten the tedium of your days by sharing with you your efforts to amuse her. I am told that she is fond of games; I, too, have a passion for them, and I will gladly play with her occasionally, that you may obtain a respite from your benevolent cares."</p>
               <p>This was said with that winning charm of manner which rendered the speaker irresistible when she chose to gain over any one. Nina, no wiser than others, yielded to its influence, and almost promised that her new acquaintance should be admitted to Mrs. Hawks' presence on the following day, though she felt very uncertain as to her power to gain the invalid's consent to such an innovation on her usual habits.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, Mrs. Langley said:</p>
               <p>"Tell your old friend that I am an adept at piquet, and I know a new French game for two persons which is easily learned and very amusing. I could teach her how to play it in a few moments."</p>
               <p>"I shall be sure to tell her, Mrs. Langley; for, to own the truth to you, it would be the greatest relief to me to have a little aid in amusing Mrs. Hawks. As her strength fails she becomes more irritable, and I often feel as if I am over-tasked."</p>
               <p>Nina was more successful with Mrs. Hawks than she had hoped; for, as death approached, the doomed woman lost much of that shrinking feeling which had led her to conceal from the outside world the dreadful contortions she exhibited in her convulsive state. She was tired of the seclusion in which she lived, though surrounded by a crowd; and when she was told of the charming woman who wished to give her a new source of enjoyment by<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6338-00000177"/> teaching her another game, she at once declared that Mrs. Langley should be welcome to visit her whenever she desired to do so.</p>
               <p>Nina was dispatched at once to invite her, and the fair conspirator speedily came with her to the apartment which, she was firmly resolved, should witness the overthrow and defeat of the heiress elect.</p>
               <p>Of course the invalid was charmed with her visitor, for Mrs. Langley intuitively knew where to touch her weak points. The game she had volunteered to teach was quickly learned, and by soon allowing Mrs. Hawks to beat in nearly every encounter, she was kept in the best of humors with her new acquaintance.</p>
               <p>In spite of Nina's keenness, Mrs. Langley proved more than a match for her, for she won her confidence completely and betrayed nothing herself, while she gained from the young schemer the history of that past which had left so bitter a wound behind it.</p>
               <p>For hours they discussed Godfrey Fenton—his past was freely laid before the girl, who seemed never weary of inquiring into every particular concerning his early life; and unsparingly was he blamed by Mrs. Langley for his want of faith toward one so worthy of him as her dear Nina was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley had entered into her part with the spirit of a thorough actress, and she justified her course to herself by the excuse so often made that "evil may be done if good is to result from it." Besides, she made the acquaintance of Inez in her aunt's room, and was not surprised that Fenton had become so passionately enamored of her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley herself was almost equally charmed with her beauty and sweetness, and her desire to defeat Nina gained added intensity after she knew her rival. Inez never mentioned Fenton's name, or alluded to him as the guest of her father, for he had warned her against betraying his vicinity to Nina Gordon, lest it might awake in her mind a suspicion of the efforts in progress to baffle her aspiring hopes.</p>
               <p>Fenton did not lay bare his plot to Inez, for he felt that to her pure and unselfish mind the course he had taken would not appear the most noble or honorable, though it was determined on in defence of her interests. So he wisely kept his own counsel, though his spirits rose from day to day as his ally reported the rapid progress she was making toward the desired consummation.</p>
               <p>The time for the grand experiment at length arrived. Nina had been induced, though with a show of reluctance, to mimic afflicted Mrs. Hawks for a select few of Mrs. Langley's most intimate friends; and although that lady was shocked at the fidelity with which the poor old convulsionaire was hit off, she laughed and applauded with the rest, and declared that they must have that amusing travestie again when her brother was present.</p>
               <p>Nina demurred to this, but her tempter knew that she should carry her point. With the assistance of Mrs. Perkins, who had entered with extreme zeal into the plan proposed to her by Godfrey Fenton, everything was prepared for the denouement.</p>
               <p>Toward the close of the week, Mrs. Langley invited Kitty Bates and her brother, with a few of her most intimate friends with whom she had made them acquainted, to a private supper in her own apartments.</p>
               <p>The door which opened from her parlor into that of Mrs. Hawks was in the centre of the wall. After Nina and her mistress had retired, Mrs. Perkins, with Fenton's assistance, brought a large mirror from the spot on which it hung, and placed it at such an angle from this door that, on unclosing<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC6338-00000178"/> it a few feet, what was passing at the upper end of the next apartment would be distinctly visible in it.</p>
               <p>By careful experiment, Mrs. Langley ascertained the precise spot on which the exhibition must be made to ensure a view of the actress in the mirror, and she disposed her furniture accordingly, leaving an open space with a sofa for the background on which the proposed scene was to be enacted.</p>
               <p>At a signal agreed on between herself and Mrs. Perkins, Mrs. Hawks was to be induced to return to her parlor at that unusual hour of the night; when the actress was in full career, the door was to be suddenly unclosed, and the old lady permitted to behold the travestie of her infirmities faithfully reflected to her from the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>The Bates party was greatly elated by this invitation to Mrs. Langley's private apartments, for it was regarded as a distinction to be received there, and they gladly accepted it. Of course Nina was to accompany them, for Mrs. Hawks would be safe in bed long before the hour named for assembling had arrived, and there was little danger that she should detect the presence of her young companion among Mrs. Langley's guests, even if the sounds of their late merriment should penetrate to her apartment.</p>
               <p>The party assembled; cards were played, but without much attention to the games, for all seemed in the gayest spirits and eager to talk. At midnight an exquisite supper was served, and champagne flowed freely. Nina was fond of this exhilarating tipple, and her hostess took care that her glass should never remain empty.</p>
               <p>The waiters came in, removed the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">débris</foreign> of the repast, and charades were proposed. There was some good impromptu acting, but Nina was the life of the party. Her matchless powers of mimicry were brought into full play, and as a last <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bonne bouche</foreign> Mrs. Langley insisted that a scene with Bijjer should be enacted <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la Hawks.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>The dog had been petted by Mrs. Langley, and he had spent many hours in her room since her intimacy with her neighbors commenced. Of course she had him in readiness on this occasion, and he was lifted from the ottoman on which he was sleeping, and brought forward to bear his part in the proposed exhibition.</p>
               <p>Nina offered a few faint objections, but she was excited by the wine she had taken, and elated by the applause her previous efforts had elicited; so she yielded to the entreaties of her hostess, and launched into a scene of such broad farce that peals of laughter greeted her efforts.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley whispered:</p>
               <p>"Capital—nothing could be better. Go on, Miss Gordon, and let us have the old lady in all her phases."</p>
               <p>And Nina went on, unconscious that the dividing door had been partially unclosed, for the room beyond was in utter darkness, and that Mrs. Hawks was noting her every action reflected in the mirror.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks at last uttered an exclamation that alarmed Mrs. Perkins; the door closed as softly as it had opened, and the outraged woman gasped:</p>
               <p>"Take me away—let me die. I have nothing to live for after witnessing such base ingratitude as that."</p>
               <p>"I told you so, ma'am, but you wouldn't believe me," was the consoling remark of her attendant as she almost bore her back to her chamber.</p>
               <p>When they reached it, Mrs. Hawks fell into a spasm so violent and long continued, that Mrs. Perkins began to fear that in this attempt to unmask Nina, she had destroyed all hope for Inez. But after using her best skill to restore her, the old lady revived, and, after a brief sleep, awoke and asked:</p>
               <p>"What time is it, Jane?"</p>
               <p>"Past three o'clock, ma'am."</p>
               <pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6338-00000179"/>
               <p>"There is time enough, then, for what I mean to do before that false creature comes fawning around me again. Prop me up with pillows, and place my desk before me. I'll spoil her prospects, the ingrate! To make my infirmities the mockery of a set of people capable of laughing at such an exhibition, is what I will never forgive."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins obeyed with alacrity; her mistress was placed in a comfortable position, the desk opened before her, and her portfolio brought. Mrs. Hawks took from her neck the key of the jewel casket, and ordered the woman to open it, and bring to her the will she had concealed in it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins hastened to place it before her. She tore open the envelope, glanced grimly over the pages her infatuation for Nina had so recently dictated, and, dipping her pen in the ink, she proceeded to add a codicil at the end of the instrument, which ran thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"I hereby revoke and cancel the bequest of property made to Nina Gordon in the foregoing pages, as I have had it clearly proved to me that she is as destitute of principle as she is of feeling or affection.</p>
                  <p>"I give and bequeath all that I may die possessed of, save the annuities bestowed on my niece, Inez Lopez, and my faithful maid, Jane Perkins, to be used for the benefit of the poor in the county in which I was born. Oakland, the ancient residence of my family, shall be made a home for destitute orphans, and the bulk of my fortune shall go to endow it."</p>
               </q>
               <p>Having written this, Mrs. Hawks turned to her attendant and asked:</p>
               <p>"Who can be got in here at this hour to witness my signature? I will not sleep before this is finished, for I feel as if I shall never wake again in this world after the shock I have received."</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, you'll outlive it, ma'am. That perfidious girl aint a going to break your heart quite yet. I don't know of any one but Mrs. Langley who could be brought in here, and <emph>she</emph> is your friend, for she helped me to show you how much you were deceived by that young serpent that has coiled herself around you of late, and made you do whatever she wanted done."</p>
               <p>"Yes; and now she has stung me to death. I feel it—I know it. I have got my death-blow, Jane. Bring whoever you please."</p>
               <p>While Mrs. Perkins was absent, Mrs. Hawks endorsed another envelope precisely as the first had been, and by the time it was ready, Mrs. Langley came in in her night dress, with a shawl wrapped around her.</p>
               <p>She was startled by the ghastly change in the face of the invalid, and hastily said:</p>
               <p>"My dear Mrs. Hawks, if I had dreamed that you would feel this so deeply, I would never have attempted to expose to you how cleverly you have been duped by this young girl. I took an interest in you, and I could not bear to think that she was only playing a part to secure the fortune I am told you designed bestowing on her. Can you forgive me for permitting her to caricature you as she did in my presence? Be assured that it was allowed only for the purpose of showing her to you in her true colors.</p>
               <p>To this Mrs. Hawks grimly replied:</p>
               <p>"I do not think that my forgiveness will be of much consequence to you, Mrs. Langley, but I am glad that even such sharp practice opened my eyes in time. I have added a codicil to my will, which I wish you to witness."</p>
               <p>"Anything I can do for you, my dear madam, I am ready to undertake. Of course I will witness your signature, and affix my own after it."</p>
               <p>"That is all I shall require."</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6338-00000180"/>
               <p>And Mrs. Hawks carefully folded down the paper in such a manner as to conceal what she had written. With a trembling and unsteady hand she then wrote her signature, and handed the pen to her visitor.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley dashed off her name impatiently, for she was disappointed at not being able to ascertain something of what had been added to the document. Mrs. Perkins wrote hers beneath, and Mrs. Hawks folded the will, and placed it in the envelope she had prepared for it. After carefully sealing it, she gasped:</p>
               <p>"It is finished. Lock it up in the casket, Jane, and leave it till it is called for."</p>
               <p>This was scarcely accomplished, and the key returned to her, when she fell into violent contortions, and the two who watched beside her thought that every moment would be her last. But the spasmodic action ceased at last, and she fell into a deep sleep from which she awoke half an hour later in another spasm.</p>
               <p>Her physician was hastily summoned, but before he could reach her side, she had passed from earth and all its troubles, and both niece and adopted daughter had lost their chances of inheriting her fortune, so far as her will could deprive them of it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley had made a hurried toilette, and returned to watch beside her through those fearful hours, but when convinced that all was over, she returned to her own room, and wrote the follow note to Fenton:</p>

                           <p>"DEAR GODFREY:—The ruse succeeded but too well, and the result has filled me with compunction for the part I have played. I did it for the best, but it has turned out very sadly.</p>
                           <p>"Mrs. Hawks is dead, and I am afraid that her decease was hastened by what she saw last night through that door that opens from her parlor into mine. Everything went off according to our wishes. Nina Gordon exposed her baseness as we had planned, and the old woman was taken back to her chamber in a state of great excitement. She had one of her attacks, but revived sufficiently to carry out her purpose of depriving the fair mimic of all chance to inherit her fortune; but, alas! she did not tear up the will as we hoped. She only added a codicil to it, but what is its nature I am unable to tell you, for she took extreme care to prevent me from glancing over it, although I affixed my name to it as a witness.</p>
                           <p>"A messenger will be sent to the Glades to warn Mr. Lopez and his daughter of what has happened here, and I shall send this by him. Come as soon as possible, as there is no further reason for keeping yourself in the background.</p>

               <p>The party at the Glades were at breakfast when this missive was placed in the hands of Fenton, and at the same time a note from Mrs. Hawks' physician conveyed to Mr. Lopez the information of his sister-in-law's decease.</p>
               <p>He read it, and coolly said:</p>
               <p>"So poor Eunice has gone before me at last. I would give a great deal to know if she left her will unaltered."</p>
               <p>Inez dropped her fork and grew pale.</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa, it cannot be so! My aunt seemed no worse when I saw her yesterday."</p>
               <p>"She is dead, child; and I am afraid that she has gone to her account with her injustice to you added to her other sins."</p>
               <p>Inez arose from the table and went into her own room. Fenton then showed his cousin's note to Lopez, and ordered his horse to be brought around as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Inez, white and tearful, spoke to her lover through an open window as he was about to mount:</p>
               <pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6338-00000181"/>
               <p>"I shall follow you to Newport as soon as the carriage is ready, for I must show every respect to my poor aunt."</p>
               <p>He drew near the window, and taking her hand, tenderly said:</p>
               <p>"Keep up your spirits, dearest, for I trust that all will be well. Mrs. Hawks discovered how false Nina Gordon is in time to undo what she had done in her favor. My cousin's note tells me that <emph>she</emph> will not get the Horton estate. I cannot stop to explain now, but I hope for the best for you. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir!</foreign>"</p>
               <p>Inez wept a few tears, but the harshness of her aunt had not inspired her with very deep affection for her, and she felt more shocked than afflicted, at her sudden demise.</p>
               <p>The voice of her father summoned her to his side, for Mr. Lopez was in too great a state of excitement to do without a listener. When she joined him, he laughed, clapped his hands, and exhibited such signs of exultation that the poor girl was deeply wounded. She pitifully cried out:</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa, I do hope that you are not rejoicing in this unseemly manner over my poor aunt's death!"</p>
               <p>"No, no. I hope that I am too good a Christian to do such a thing as that, Inez. I am as sorry for Eunice as can be expected, considering our relations to each other. You know they were never very friendly, but we'll let that pass on this solemn occasion. What I am exulting over is the defeat of that girl. <emph>She</emph> has lost her chances anyhow, and all through Fenton's cleverness. That charming Mrs. Langley you told me of meeting in your aunt's room is a relation of Godfrey's, and she found means to convince the old lady how hollow all Miss Gordon's pretensions of affection were. Eunice revoked the bequest she had made in her favor, and she <emph>may</emph> have been just to you at last. Isn't that fact enough to inspire me with the brightest hopes for you? I shall live to see you the mistress of Oakland yet."</p>
               <p>"Dear papa, don't talk of enjoying my aunt's possessions just now, if you please. It wounds me to hear you speak so, and I am afraid that I am not worthy to claim them, even if they should eventually fall to me."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! Don't be aping humility, child, for it is not to my taste. Who <emph>is</emph> worthy, I should like to know, if such a girl as you are is found wanting? But there is the carriage coming round,—get your bonnet and go at once; but be sure to come back as soon as possible to tell me everything that occurs. I must be taken in to hear the will read, I suppose; but I cannot attend the funeral, for of course she will be buried at Oakland, and it will be impossible for me to make so long a journey as that in my condition."</p>
               <p>Glad to escape from his comments, Inez hastened to prepare for her visit, and after providing all that her father required, she kissed him, and set out for Newport.</p>
               <p>Dick, as anxious as herself to reach the scene of action, drove rapidly, and in a short time Inez found herself at the door of the private entrance leading to Mrs. Hawks' apartments.</p>
               <p>Fenton was on the lookout for her arrival, and he conducted her to Mrs. Langley's parlor. That lady received her with most affectionate empressement, and gave her an account of what had occurred in her aunt's room after her last seizure, though she wisely left it to Fenton to withhold or explain to his betrothed the cause of Miss Gordon's sudden overthrow in such a manner as might seem best to himself.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">DEATH CLAIMS A VICTIM, AND A LOVER IS MADE A FOE.</head>
               <p>NINA did not awake till a late hour of the morning from the heavy slumbers induced by the dissipation of the previous night, and the quantity of champagne she had drank.</p>
               <p>When she looked at her watch she was startled to find that her usual hour of going to Mrs. Hawks had long passed, and she wondered why she had not been summoned to her presence.</p>
               <p>After making a rapid toilette, she was about to issue from her chamber, when Mrs. Perkins came in, wearing a most lugubrious expression of face. Nina glanced at her and inquired:</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Perkins? Has anything happened to distress you? and why was I not called before this? It is very late, and I am afraid that Mrs. Hawks needed me while I was oversleeping myself."</p>
               <p>"She won't never need you nor anybody else any more, Miss Gordon. It's all over with my poor mistress at last. She went off in one of them convulsions, and I thought it was no use to call you, seeing that you was up so late last night in Mrs. Langley's room."</p>
               <p>The storm of anger that was gathering on Nina's brow at the avowal of such neglect, recoiled before the woman's last words. She sank back, white and trembling, but she quickly recovered herself and ferociously cried:</p>
               <p>"How dared you let me sleep when my dear old friend was dying? I am sure she would have desired to see me if she could have spoken. It was a most unheard-of piece of insolence in you to let such an event happen without even informing me of the danger."</p>
               <p>"'Twan't none o' my business to be coming after you. She would never let you be called up in the night when she was well enough to have a will of her own, and how was I to know that this attack would prove fatal any more than others before it? As to my insolence, I don't recognize your right to talk to me in such a way, Miss, and what is more I won't put up with it."</p>
               <p>"How are you to help yourself, Mrs. Perkins?" asked Nina, disdainfully. "Since Mrs. Hawks is dead, I am in a position to make you feel my power, and I would advise you to be more respectful to the heiress of her fortune. If you do not know that her will was executed in my favor, <emph>I</emph> do, so you had best consult your own interests by keeping on fair terms with me."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins felt sorely tempted to tell her what had passed in the room of the departed lady but a few hours before, but Fenton had warned her not to do so. When the will was read Nina would learn the truth, and that would be time enough to enlighten her.</p>
               <p>So the irate woman bridled her tongue, and bowing with ironical respect, replied:</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you're right, Miss. We won't talk about business afore her that's gone is safe under the sods, poor lady. I came in to tell you what has happened, and to say that your breakfast has been waiting some time."</p>
               <p>Nina went into the parlor where her solitary meal was served, but she had no appetite. She lingered over the table, because she felt a thrilling dread of entering the chamber in which lay all that remained of Mrs. Hawks.</p>
               <p>She had a vivid horror of death. To her it was annihilation—a return of the body to the earth from whence it sprung; for she had no comprehension of the sublime doctrine of the resurrection. Material in every pulse of her being, Nina felt within herself no assurance of immortality<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6338-00000183"/> tality, and the faith which education had sought to inculcate bore no fruit.</p>
               <p>She at length summoned courage to enter the darkened apartment, and approach the frozen image that lay upon the bed, dressed in the rich robes of costly fashion, which had once decked her as a bride.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks had preserved this dress for its present use, and she had exacted from her attendant a promise to array her in it for burial; and if anything would have added to Nina's horror of death, it was the sight of that worn and faded form tricked out in satin and lace, and decked with artificial flowers.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins had shrunk from placing the coronet of pearls, which had formed the bridal coiffure, upon the grey hair of the poor old woman, and in its place she had tied on a plain tulle cap, trimmed with white ribbon; but she now spoke and gave a different reason:</p>
               <p>"She wore a set of pearls when she was married, Miss Gordon, but as they were locked up in the casket where the will was put, and she told you to open it yourself after she was gone, I thought I had better not meddle with 'em."</p>
               <p>"You did perfectly right, Mrs. Perkins. The jewel casket must not be opened except in the presence of the lawyer who drew up the will. What have you done with the key to it?"</p>
               <p>"Here it is, Miss, sealed up in this paper, and as you are more interested in the will than any one else, if what you said not long ago is true, you had better put it in a safe place yourself."</p>
               <p>Nina took the key and placed it with the casket in a cabinet in which the latter was kept. She locked that, and after putting the key in her own pocket, turned again toward the corpse. She vainly tried to repress the shiver that ran through her blood as she said.</p>
               <p>"She was the best friend I ever had, Mrs. Perkins, and although I cannot cry and go on as many other women would, I feel her loss very severely."</p>
               <p>"I dare say, Miss. And so do I, I am sure. I have lived with her many years, and hard as she was to please sometimes, she had her good points. She was a generous woman, too, and she aint forgot neither of us, I know."</p>
               <p>"I am sure she has not. Who has undertaken the arrangements about the funeral? I think that I should have been consulted before anything was done."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that, Miss Gordon. Mr. Lopez is the person to order everything, for he's her brother-in-law, you know, and he's sent in the young gentleman what is going to marry Miss Inez, to do what he couldn't attend to himself. Mr. Fenton has already seen the undertaker, and arranged to have Mrs. Hawks taken to Oakland and buried in the family grave-yard."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fenton!" repeated Nina, with flashing eyes. "Is it possible after all I told her that Miss Lopez has again received into favor that false man? And <emph>he</emph> is intruding himself here to control what I, as the heiress of Mrs. Hawks, am certainly entitled to manage in my own way!"</p>
               <p>"How do you know that you are the heiress?" brusquely asked Mrs. Perkins. "Did you listen at the door the day the will was made? But heiress or not, <emph>you're</emph> not the person to dictate where that poor old woman is to be buried, while she has relations to look after the last thing that can be done for her. Miss Inez has come in, and she's in Mrs. Langley's room; among them they had decided on what was to be done, before I went to wake you up."</p>
               <p>Smothering her indignation at the rudeness of the speaker, Nina haughtily said:</p>
               <p>"I must submit to this indignity for the present, but it will not be long before you will all understand that it would<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6338-00000184"/> have been as well to treat me with more consideration. I will return to my own room now, and remain in the seclusion that best befits my feelings, till the time arrives to pay the last respect to the remains of my dear old friend. I suppose that I shall at least be notified as to when the funeral is to take place."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so, of course; but I can tell you now what arrangements have been made. The body will be taken to Oakland on the morning boat, be buried in the afternoon, and we may not come back till the next day. Mrs. Hawks hadn't many friends, but I suppose hers and those of Mr. Lopez will see her respectably buried."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so," was the listless reply. "And now I will retire to my own room. I do not wish to be disturbed, as I feel the need of repose and thought, after the dreadful shock I have sustained. I am not fit to share your watch, Mrs. Perkins, so I hope you will not think hardly of me for leaving you alone with the dead."</p>
               <p>"By no manner of means, Miss. You can go as soon as you like, for I aint nervous nor nothing of that sort in the presence of what we've all got to come to some day."</p>
               <p>Nina shivered, and hastily swept out of the room, and the irate watcher added:</p>
               <p>"Your room is better than your company, any way, you deceitful varment; trying to look sorry when your heart is beating hallelujahs at the thought that you've secured all the money. But you'll find out before long that Jane Perkins has been one too many for you this time, sharp as you think yourself. Oh my! won't she be cut down when she finds out how things are."</p>
               <p>While Mrs. Perkins thus muttered, Nina made her way to her own room, secured the door on the inner side, and escaping through the linen closet, gained Kitty's apartment, into which she burst with a bound that aroused her friend from her late slumbers, for Kitty had not yet risen.</p>
               <p>In irrepressible exultation, Nina cried out:</p>
               <p>"Open your eyes, you sluggard, and listen to what I have to tell you. I ought to put on a long face and sham sorrow, I suppose, but with you, Kit, I need not be on my good behavior. Only guess what has happened."</p>
               <p>Kitty raised herself up, with the long hair escaping from the comb that held it and falling over her face. She put it aside, and gained as good a view of the speaker as the dim light in the room permitted.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Nina? You look exultant, yet scared. Have you seen a ghost, and has it told you that great good fortune is in store for you?"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! no—but I have seen a body from which the spirit has recently escaped, and that makes me a little nervous. Mrs. Hawks is dead, Kitty, and my inheritance has fallen to me. I have the key in my pocket that holds the 'open sesame' to fortune."</p>
               <p>Kitty sprang up in great excitement.</p>
               <p>"You don't say so, Nina! This is glorious news indeed, and I sincerely congratulate you. That poor, suffering woman is better out of the world than in it, so it is idle to waste any sympathy on her fate. Come, tell me all about it, dear; I am impatient to learn every particular."</p>
               <p>As well as she could, Nina explained what had happened, saying that Mrs. Hawks had died so suddenly, that she did not get to her bedside in time to take a last farewell of her.</p>
               <p>"That was bad," commented Kitty; "but it was too late to make any change in her intentions toward you on account of the neglect. You must put on the deepest mourning, Nina, and show every outward respect to the memory of the poor old lady."</p>
               <p>"Such is my intention; and I came here to ask you to go out with your mother, and order some things for me that must be ready by the morning. I have a black dress that<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6338-00000185"/> will answer for the funeral, but I must have a crape collar and a mourning bonnet, with a heavy veil. And, oh, Kitty! don't forget to buy a dozen very fine handkerchiefs with a broad black border around them. They will be indispensable, you know, to wipe my tears away."</p>
               <p>A faint, derisive smile quivered on her lip, and Kitty significantly replied:</p>
               <p>"Or to conceal the lack of them. I understand; I shall select everything in the latest style, for of all toilettes, a mourning one should be most carefully got up. It is so unbecoming, that only extreme elegance in the material and make, can compensate one for being obliged to wear it."</p>
               <p>Nina glanced at the reflection of herself in the mirror, and said:</p>
               <p>"To one as fair as I am, and with my glittering hair, I don't think it will be very unbecoming. At any rate, I shall not wear it longer than conventional propriety requires."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; and you will soon have an excuse for laying it aside altogether. Bridal robes shall take its place, and my darling Nina shine forth a resplendent star in society next winter as Mrs. Adolphus Bates. Shall it not be so, dear?"</p>
               <p>Nina turned her face from the inquiring eyes fixed upon her; with an affected shiver, she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Kitty, how can you bear to mix up the two extremes of life, death and marriage, in such a way? It chills me even to think of <emph>my</emph> bridal in conjunction with a funeral. When your brother asks me that question, I will give an explicit answer, but not before."</p>
               <p>"I thought all that was settled long ago," said Kitty, opening her eyes very widely. "Dolly thinks himself sure of you, and there is no need of postponing the marriage."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed! Well, perhaps Mr. Bates is right; but nothing is sure in this life, Kitty, till it has actually taken place. There, I won't detain you any longer, dear. Make your toilette as soon as you can, and go out for the things I shall want. I must go back to my room now, lest some one my knock at my door, and find out that I am not in it."</p>
               <p>Nina flitted back, and made a hasty reconnoisance of the parlor, which she found empty, and then shutting herself up in solitude, gave the reins to her fancy, building castles in the air as gorgeous and glittering as boundless wealth could make them.</p>
               <p>She revelled in the brilliant future she believed was opening before her, and not a doubt arose as to its stability. The will of Mrs. Hawks gave her all, and the one made by her father, for the possession of which she had bargained with Wilkins, she would destroy, and thus secure the enjoyment of the estate beyond a doubt. Nina had no scruples as to what should be done with it when it fell into her hands, and she thought lightly of the large sum she had agreed to pay in exchange for it.</p>
               <p>Godfrey Fenton's image mingled with her dreams of the future, and she would not doubt, that as the mistress of the fortune which should have devolved to Inez Lopez, she could also lure from her the man who had played the part of lover to them both. She could forgive his temporary infidelity, and bind him to her again in bonds too strong to be broken at his own wayward will.</p>
               <p>Nina found it impossible to remain quiescent. With such thoughts surging through her brain, her blood was in a ferment, and she paced her floor with rapid steps, till the voice of Mrs. Perkins speaking at her door, arrested them. She came with a message from Miss Lopez, who was waiting to see Miss Gordon in the next room.</p>
               <p>"I will come out in a few moments," said Nina in reply, and she went to her mirror, and looked at her own face. It<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6338-00000186"/> was flashing with excitement, and brilliant with triumph. Shaking her head, she muttered:</p>
               <p>"This will never do. She will read me through if I do not wear a mask. I am actress enough to put on any semblance I choose, and I must play the broken hearted, though I feel as if I had wings that could bear me to the empyrean. I have won this girl's fortune, and in time I will have what she values far beyond that—the love of the man to whom she is betrothed. Oh, Fortune! Blind goddess! How grateful I am to thee!"</p>
               <p>Nina rubbed her eyes till the lids were reddened, powdered her face till in the darkened room it looked almost colorless, and assuming an expression of deep seriousness, she took her handkerchief in her hand, and slowly opening her door, advanced toward Inez, who sat with her head resting on her hand in an attitude of deep thought.</p>
               <p>"My dear Miss Lopez, this is a very sad meeting. I see that you feel the blow that has fallen on both of us, quite as deeply as I do. But to me it is even heavier than to you, for in the decease of your dear aunt I have lost the only true friend I had in the world. The shock has unnerved me, and in these first hours of bereavement, I know not whither to turn for consolation."</p>
               <p>Inez was willing to believe in the genuineness of her affliction, and she felt deep compassion for the disappointment she knew was in store for her. She gently replied:</p>
               <p>"To Heaven we are taught to look for consolation in such bereavements as this, Miss Gordon, and I have calmed myself by praying fervently for the repose of my departed aunt's soul. Her sudden death was also a shock to me, for yesterday I thought her looking better than usual. You were not with her in her last moments, I have been told."</p>
               <p>"No; and that adds to my affliction. Through mistaken kindness, Mrs. Perkins did not call me up, and when all was over, she thought it useless to arouse me to the consciousness of the great calamity that had befallen me. Oh, Inez, I am left very desolate by the irreparable loss I have sustained."</p>
               <p>She concealed her face in the folds of her handkerchief, and seemed to be sobbing violently. Inez soothingly said:</p>
               <p>"Compose yourself, Miss Gordon, and try and feel that you have some claim on my father and myself. When we return from Oakland I shall be happy to receive you as my guest at the Glades till you have decided on your future movements."</p>
               <p>With a gesture of defiant pride, Nina said:</p>
               <p>"Thank you; but that is impossible. I cannot again throw myself in the way of Mr. Fenton, and I believe he is at present an inmate of your father's house."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Fenton will not return permanently to the Glades," replied Inez, coldly, "and you need not see him when he calls unless you desire it. I asked you to come to us because I thought a few days retirement would be agreeable to you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for your consideration for me, but I will not intrude into a house in which I feel that I should not be entirely welcome. Your father does not like me, and—and I have friends here who will gladly take charge of me."</p>
               <p>"As you please. I thought it right to give you the option of coming to us, and hereafter, should you wish to do so, the Glades will be open to you. I must leave you now, for I promised my father to remain no longer than was absolutely necessary. Good morning, Miss Gordon."</p>
               <p>The fire that was smouldering in the breast of Nina here flamed up, and she bitterly said:</p>
               <p>"I have warned you, Inez Lopez, and you have refused to accept the warning. You have renewed your trust in Godfrey Fenton, but he will yet break your heart. He will<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6338-00000187"/> desert you as he did me, when he finds that you are not the heiress to your aunt's wealth."</p>
               <p>Inez fixed her clear eyes full upon her, and proudly said:</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> trust him, Miss Gordon, in spite of your efforts to sow dissension between us. How do you know that I am not to inherit my grandfather's estate? Did my aunt confide to you her intention to deprive me of it?"</p>
               <p>"She did, this far. Mrs. Hawks told me herself that <emph>I</emph> am the person most deeply interested in the contents of her will. Of course her words could bear but one interpretation."</p>
               <p>"It matters not; construe them as you will. I shall not enlighten you till the proper time arrives. A few more days, and we shall both know what we have to depend on. Once more good morning."</p>
               <p>Inez hastened from the room, filled with pity for the terrible blow that awaited her, in spite of all Nina had done to annoy her and interfere with her just rights.</p>
               <p>The door closed on her, and, with an impatient stamp of her foot, Nina cried out:</p>
               <p>"What did she mean by those words? What could she intend to hint? But why should I care? My future is secure, in spite of every attempt they may make to wrest from me the fortune my own wit has won. Yes, yes—I am <emph>secure,</emph> and I can afford to laugh at their puny efforts to shake my faith in my lucky star."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley did not call on Nina, which rather surprised her; but she ceased to think about it when Kitty came to her room bringing with her the handkerchiefs about which her friend's directions had been so particular.</p>
               <p>The two dined together, and spent the afternoon in pleasant gossip, arranging their plans for the ensuing winter, though Nina half smiled as she thought how baseless were Kitty's hopes of claiming her as her sister-in-law. <emph>Now</emph> she did not think of accepting Mr. Adolphus Bates, and she intended to avail herself of the first opportunity of telling him so.</p>
               <p>Late in the evening, the milliner sent in a coquettish-looking little bonnet made of crape, and covered with a long veil, to be used on the morrow to conceal the absence of the emotion the adopted daughter of Mrs. Hawks should have felt. There was also a mode mantle, trimmed with folds of crape of the orthodox breath, and several pairs of black kid gloves.</p>
               <p>I shall not describe the funeral. Suffice it to state that it was conducted with every regard to propriety and good taste, and Inez was perfectly satisfied with the arrangements made by her lover. Mrs. Langley accompanied Fenton, and herself and Adolphus Bates escorted his sister and Nina; but the two parties held themselves aloof from each other as much as possible.</p>
               <p>The coldest and briefest recognition passed between Fenton and Miss Gordon, and no word was uttered by either. Mrs. Perkins and Dick also formed a part of the funeral cortege, and when they reached Oakland they found everything in readiness for the burial, to which several of the country families had come.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hawks had been a member of the Episcopal Church, and a clergyman from a neighboring chapel was in attendance. The simple and impressive burial service was read over the grave; the solemn and consoling assurance "I am the Resurrection and the Life" repeated, and the unlamented one was consigned to her last resting-place, beside the father and sister between whom she had widened the breach that the fortune she had so lately disposed of might be her own, to do as she pleased with.</p>
               <p>Inez wept some bitter tears over the desolate life and sudden death of her aunt, but no one knew better than herself<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6338-00000188"/> self that the deceased had repelled the affection she might have had, and it was not in nature that she should deeply grieve over the decease of a relative who had always snubbed her, and at the last had placed a comparative stranger in the position she was herself entitled to fill.</p>
               <p>An elaborate repast had been prepared by Mrs. Wilkins, and on the return of the company from the grave-yard they gathered around the table, and did ample justice to the "funeral baked-meats."</p>
               <p>The old friends of her family approached Inez with kind greetings, and hopes were expressed that they should soon have her among them as a resident at the old place. She received these as courtesies with her usual gentle grace, but evaded giving a positive reply.</p>
               <p>Nina looked on and listened in scornful amusement, wondering if these simple-hearted people thought it a matter of course that the fortune of Mrs. Hawks should descend to her niece. To her intense relief, the lugubrious affair was at length over, farewells exchanged, and the whole party re-embarked on the small steamer Fenton had chartered to take them to Oakland and remain till they were ready to return.</p>
               <p>The night was brilliantly clear, and the moon shone with silvery lustre on the waters of the bay.</p>
               <p>The cabin was close and warm, so the ladies preferred remaining on deck, and Adolphus Bates made up his mind that, before they reached Newport, Nina should give him a positive assurance of her intention to bestow herself and her presumed inheritance upon himself.</p>
               <p>He availed himself of the first opportunity to withdraw her from the others, and to this Nina passively submitted, for she began to be very weary of his devotion, and thought this as good an opportunity as she should have to give him to understand that she had no intention of accepting him.</p>
               <p>In spite of Fenton's coldness to her and his devotion to Inez, her passion for him sprang into new and fiercer life, and Nina felt that she could never give her hand to any other man while a chance remained that he might yet be won. In comparison with Godfrey, her dandy lover seemed utterly contemptible, so she was not in a mood to soften the terms of her refusal.</p>
               <p>The moon shone down on her set face as Adolphus whispered:</p>
               <p>"Nina, darling, why do you look so coldly on me? Have I offended you in any way? Oh, my angel, in this hour I desire above all things to win the confirmation of the hopes you have permitted me to indulge!"</p>
               <p>Unmoved by his fervor, she icily replied:</p>
               <p>"You have not offended me, Mr. Bates. You only weary me by constantly referring to a subject I wish to set at rest between us forever. I cannot marry you, for I do not feel for you that affection you would be entitled to from your wife. I beg that you will speak to me in this way no more."</p>
               <p>The astonishment of Mr. Bates at this unlooked-for declaration was even greater than his chagrin. He exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Nina, do I hear aright?"</p>
               <p>"I believe I spoke plain English, sir," was the disdainful reply.</p>
               <p>And Bates rapidly went on:</p>
               <p>"Then you have played with me till you secured your own position; and, that done, you cast me off. You have wilfully deceived me, Miss Gordon. You have worn your mask as long as it suited your purpose to do so, and you drop it in the first moment of assured success. If your schemes with reference to Mrs. Hawks had failed, I might perhaps have received a different answer; but I, at least, have been disinterested, for I asked you to be my wife<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6338-00000189"/> before I knew that you would gain anything by the death of the old lady."</p>
               <p>This plain speaking irritated Nina, and she bitterly retorted:</p>
               <p>"But not before Kitty had betrayed my confidence with regard to the will made in my favor. You asked me <emph>then</emph> to marry you, Mr. Bates, but not before. I believe that we now fully understand each other, sir, and further words will be superfluous."</p>
               <p>Nina turned from him almost contemptuously; and, outraged and astonished at this summary dismissal of his pretensions, Adolphus hastened to confide his unexpected discomfiture to his sister. Kitty listened in incredulous amazement, for she had thought the future of the two definitely settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bates ended by saying:</p>
               <p>"Miss Gordon has no further use for us, Kitty; and I now believe her heartless enough to break off her friendship with you, devoted as you have been to her. As to myself, I am done with her, and I shall leave for New York in the morning. The old man declares that he must have money to keep the house from crashing, and I shall take the girl he has selected for me. If Ada Pierre isn't as beautiful or brilliant as your friend, she will probably make me a more suitable wife. I have waked up from my delusion, Kitty, and I only hope that you will soon come to your senses too, and let this handsome tigress go her own way. It will be better for us all to wash our hands of her I am now convinced."</p>
               <p>But Kitty could not be induced to take this view, and she entreated her brother to allow her to remonstrate with Nina. This he utterly refused, declaring that nothing should induce him to renew his offer to Miss Gordon.</p>
               <p>It was midnight when they reached the hotel again; and, late as it was, Kitty went into Nina's room and asked her to explain what had happened that night.</p>
               <p>To this entreaty she petulantly replied:</p>
               <p>"I am tired to death and out of sorts. I wish you would not annoy me with questions now, Kitty. If you insist on knowing why I refused your brother, I must tell you that it is because I do not love him; and what is more, I never shall do so. I hope that is satisfactory."</p>
               <p>"Quite so," replied Kitty, with a sudden assumption of dignity, though she became very pale. "I only wish that you had known your own mind a little sooner, Nina. I have loved you very dearly, and I have done all that lay in my power to serve you, but this last act of yours has opened my eyes to your true character. I cannot forgive the way my brother has been treated by you. You have led him on in every possible way, and now that you have gained what you have schemed for, you cast him off. I bid you good night, and good-bye at the same time, for I shall insist that mamma shall return to New York with Dolly. We will leave in the morning, and after what has occurred to-night, I don't suppose that you will care how soon we go."</p>
               <p>"Why should I?" asked Nina, coldly. "If you are willing to give me up on such slight grounds, of course I shall not entreat you to retain a place in your affections for me. Good-bye, Kitty; school-girl friendships are not often worth much, and ours has had its day, I suppose. Don't be too hard on me, for if I had consented to marry your brother, I should have made him miserable."</p>
               <p>Poor Kitty was half-broken-hearted at this sudden rupture with one she had so unselfishly loved, but she was too deeply outraged to betray all she felt. She held out her hand and said:</p>
               <p>"I will not give you a Judas kiss, nor receive another<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6338-00000190"/> from you, Nina. It is all over between us, for from this hour I give you up; but you will never find a better friend than I have been to you."</p>
               <p>Nina took the offered hand, and said:</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Kitty. I think you very unreasonable to look on my refusal of your brother as a just cause for breaking our friendship. But, since it is your wish to do it, I will not remonstrate."</p>
               <p>"It is not the refusal, Nina, but the—the encouragement that preceded it that——But it is useless to talk about it now. I hope we shall never meet again—never! It would be too painful."</p>
               <p>Kitty escaped from the room, and went to her own to cry herself to sleep; for she was tender-hearted and sincere, and Nina was left alone. She wearily muttered:</p>
               <p>"So that phase of my life is over, and those vulgar, rich people finally got rid of. They have served my turn, and now I am done with them. Poor Kitty deserved a better return for all her kindness. I do like her passably well, but the others are not to my taste, and with my fortune I can soon find enough who will suit me far better than the Bates family."</p>
               <p>Thus musing, Nina hastened to disrobe, and throw herself upon her couch, where she soon fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THERE'S MANY A SLIP TWIXT THE CUP AND THE LIP.</head>
               <p>THE voice of Mrs. Perkins at her bedside awoke Nina, and she sprang up, bright and animated, all the significance of the summons rushing at once upon her mind.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Manly will be here at eleven o'clock, Miss Gordon, and I thought you had better be aroused in time to eat your breakfast comfortably, before the time comes for reading the will. So I made bold to come in and speak to you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Perkins; you were quite right to do so. I shall be ready directly; order breakfast in half an hour, if you please. I really feel hungry this morning."</p>
               <p>The woman went out, muttering to herself:</p>
               <p>"I wonder how much appetite she'll have for her dinner? It's a mighty fall she's going to get, and she'll take it as hard as any one I know. After all her gallivanting with that young Bates, she sent him adrift last night—I know by the signs. If she'd only known what is in store for her, I guess she'd a held him to his promises. But <emph>he's</emph> had a lucky escape any how, and he may thank his stars that Mr. Fenton made me hold my tongue about what Mrs. Hawks did before that last fit struck her."</p>
               <p>Nina did not dress hurriedly. She made a very careful toilette, and as she stood before the mirror, she thought that however unbecoming mourning was to most women, it only set off the dazzling fairness of her complexion, and proved how charming she could be in any dress.</p>
               <p>Assuming an air of coquettish languor, she finally issued from her room to enjoy the dainty breakfast set for her, with the triumphant feeling that henceforth the world lay at her feet, and she had only to stretch forth her hand to grasp the varied delights it offers to youth, beauty and fortune.</p>
               <p>She revelled in the thought of Inez's disappointment, and the humiliation of Fenton. She had no pity for either, and she almost resented the thought that any portion of the estate must be surrendered to her rival in love, if not in fortune.</p>
               <p>The breakfast things were removed, and Nina prepared<pb n="396-397" xml:id="VAC6338-00000191"/> for the reception of the expected party. The jewel casket was brought forth and placed on a table, and very soon afterward a bustle outside of the door warned her of the arrival of Mr. Lopez and his daughter.</p>
               <p>By the use of a crutch and Fenton's arm, he was got safely into the room, and Miss Gordon received him with the stately grace of a young princess, doing the honors of her court. At Fenton she cast a single glance, full of triumphant meaning, which she left him to interpret at his leisure, and to Inez she offered her hand with a patronizing air that the elder gentleman felt inclined to resent. He hastily said:</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Miss Gordon, you queen it grandly. From your manner, one would think that <emph>you</emph> are the niece, and my daughter the dependent of the poor old lady, whose last testament we are about to inspect."</p>
               <p>To this taunt, Nina replied with honeyed sweetness:</p>
               <p>"I had the honor to be recognized as the adopted daughter of my dear deceased friend, Mr. Lopez, and that, I believe, entitles me to as much consideration as a niece can claim."</p>
               <p>His sharp black eyes surveyed her with an expression she could not fathom, but he only said:</p>
               <p>"Well, well—'least said is soonest mended;' we shall soon see in what sort of consideration my sister-in-law held my young lady."</p>
               <p>Nina lifted her head defiantly, and closed her red lips firmly over her set teeth to restrain the words that rushed to them. She believed his pettishness to be the offspring of his fears that his own daughter had been disinherited for her sake, and she thought she could bear his ill-humor till the full measure of her triumph burst on the assembled group and atoned for the rudeness she was now made to endure.</p>
               <p>Fenton left the room, and to her surprise, returned accompanied by Mrs. Langley. In a few more moments, Mr. Manly entered, closely followed by Dick and Mrs. Perkins, and the door was closed and locked.</p>
               <p>After bowing coldly to Mrs. Langley, for she resented her abandonment of herself for Inez, Nina drew Mr. Manly aside and asked in a low tone:</p>
               <p>"Why is a stranger invited to be present at the reading of the will? Mrs. Langley can have no interest in it."</p>
               <p>In great embarrassment, the lawyer replied:</p>
               <p>"You will very soon understand why she came, Miss Gordon. At present I cannot explain. The time is getting on, and we must attend to the business in hand at once, for I have an appointment at my office at one o'clock."</p>
               <p>She haughtily replied:</p>
               <p>"You cannot proceed too soon to do what brought you hither, sir. I am quite ready to hear myself proclaimed the heiress of Mrs. Hawks' estate, for such, she herself assured me I am."</p>
               <p>The expression of compassionate interest that flitted over Manly's face was incomprehensible to Nina, but it did not awaken a suspicion of the truth. She turned coldly from him, and seating herself near the table on which the casket rested, spoke aloud as she pointed to it:</p>
               <p>"In that casket the will of Mrs. Hawks will be found, and here is the key, Mr. Manly, in this sealed envelope. Mrs. Perkins can testify that it has not been opened since my dear friend locked it with her own hands."</p>
               <p>With a low bow, Manly received the key and replied:</p>
               <p>"No such testimony is needed, Miss Gordon. All present are fully convinced that the document in question will be found exactly as it was left by our late lamented friend."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lamented!</emph>" sneered Mr. Lopez, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce.</foreign> "I wonder if old Jeremiah would not have done more in that time<pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6338-00000192"/> if he could have been resuscitated for the purpose. Why should anybody lament that selfish old woman, I wonder. If it turns out that she has cut Inez off, I shall soon follow her to the other world, and it will go hard with me, but I'll find some means of paying her off there."</p>
               <p>Luckily these irreverent mutterings were unnoticed, for all were intent on the motions of the lawyer.</p>
               <p>With due professional gravity, he broke the seal of the envelope, unlocked the casket, and drew from it the important document, the contents of which were to be so crushing to at least one of the expectant hearers—so disappointing to the others.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly read the endorsement, opened it, and, clearing his throat, proceeded to read in a distinct voice, the disposition of Mrs. Hawks' estate so lately written by himself. He made a pause at that point, and Nina triumphantly turned to Mr. Lopez and said:</p>
               <p>"I think my claims as an adopted daughter are now fully vindicated, sir. What is your opinion?"</p>
               <p>"It is just the same as it was before,—that Eunice Hawks was an old fool, and you an accomplished deceiver. But we have not heard all yet. I see that the feeble hand of my sister-in-law has added something to what you wrote, Mr. Manly, so pray let us have that."</p>
               <p>Nina gasped for breath; she became pale as death as she faltered:</p>
               <p>"No, no—that was all the will contained when it was placed in the casket. If anything has been added to it, it is a forgery."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed, young lady. I will swear to Eunice Hawks' writing, and that is certainly hers. Besides, we have two witnesses to prove that on the last night of her life, she took the will from that casket herself, and added a codicil to it. Mrs. Perkins was present, and she brought Mrs. Langley ley in to witness the signature of her mistress, and to affix her own after it. Whatever it contains is certainly valid."</p>
               <p>Nina felt as if life was receding from her, but she made a violent effort to regain self-control, and her pale lips said to the lawyer:</p>
               <p>"Go on, sir. I do not suppose there is any material alteration in the disposition of the estate."</p>
               <p>Thus commanded, Mr. Manly, in a low tone, but with perfect distinctness, read the last words written by Mrs. Hawks in that paroxysm of wounded feeling and outraged pride which had hastened her death.</p>
               <p>Every word struck upon the heart of the baffled schemer as the stroke of a dagger; but the very sharpness of the blow sustained her for the time. Color returned to her cheeks and lips, and she defiantly turned her flashing eyes from face to face and slowly said:</p>
               <p>"There has been a base conspiracy to defraud me of the wealth my dear old friend designed for me, and I declare my intention to expose it at all hazards. What but shameful falsehood could so suddenly have changed the feelings of Mrs. Hawks toward me? for I am unconscious of having done anything to offend or alienate her."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley here came forward looking very pale, but firm in her resolve to avow her own share of the transactions of that sad night. After an effort, she cleared her voice and addressed herself directly to Nina.</p>
               <p>"Miss Gordon, to <emph>me</emph> you owe it that fortune has eluded your grasp. I was shocked at seeing you mimic your benefactress for the amusement of strangers, and I so contrived it that on the night you gave that last exhibition in my parlor, the old lady was brought into this room. That door was unclosed a few moments when you were in full career in your shameful mockery. A mirror was so placed that she saw you reflected in it, and understood what you were doing.</p>
               <pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6338-00000193"/>
               <p>"She was taken back to her chamber, where she lay ill for several hours; but, with the first reaction of her mind, she ordered her will to be brought to her, and, with her own hand, added the codicil you have just heard read. I was sent for in time to witness her signature; my name and that of Mrs. Perkins follow it as witnesses; and it will be quite useless for you to attempt to dispute its authenticity."</p>
               <p>Nina listened like one in a terrible dream. She faintly asked:</p>
               <p>"What had I done to you, Mrs. Langley, that you should have injured me so irreparably? <emph>You</emph> urged me on to do what I did that night, I now see with what purpose. Was it kind?—Was it generous?—to treat me thus?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley changed color and looked embarrassed, but she steadily replied:</p>
               <p>"When so much was at stake for one in whom I am deeply interested, I felt forced to unmask you, Miss Gordon. I thought it unjust that <emph>you</emph> should obtain possession of Mrs. Hawks' fortune to the exclusion of her niece, so I showed you to her in your true character. If I did wrong, I am sufficiently punished by the unexpected denouement. If I had dreamed that the knowledge of your perfidy would have destroyed the old lady, I should never have attempted to betray it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," said Nina, exultingly, "you see how much she loved me! And, after all, Miss Lopez gets no more than she claimed under the will; so what have you really gained by ruining me? We are all friends here, so I will propose what has occurred to me. The codicil is written on the bottom of the sheet, and it is blank on the other side. Let us tear it off and destroy it, and I will give Mr. Lopez a written agreement to divide the inheritance equally with his daughter. There is enough to make us both rich, so why should we contend about it?"</p>
               <p>Her manner was so wild and excited, this proposal so impossible to be carried into effect, that the listeners believed the sudden shock had deprived her of her senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly sternly said:</p>
               <p>"Such a thing could not be done, Miss Gordon. You are not quite sane, or you would never have proposed it."</p>
               <p>Nina raised her hand to her brow with a helpless gesture of dismay and defeat, as she faltered:</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I am mad. My brain seems bursting, and—and everything begins to grow black before me. Give me water—water!"</p>
               <p>A glass containing wine was held to her lips, and the reaction it produced restored the strength and fire which had deserted her. With a smile of strange mockery, she turned to Inez, and said:</p>
               <p>"You heard how the fair proposal I made was received; we cannot divide the estate because an absurd scruple stands in the way. Deliver me from people who cannot distinguish between what is just and what seems right to their narrow minds. We are both impoverished, Miss Lopez,—I, utterly so; and you, in all that you hold most dear; for <emph>that man,</emph>" pointing toward Fenton, "will never marry you now,—<emph>never!</emph> He has no fortune of his own; and you, without the wealth of your aunt, will soon be no more to him than I now am."</p>
               <p>"It is false!" cried Fenton, impetuously. "I love Inez as I never loved any other woman, and my actions shall prove how little I value the fortune of which she has been deprived."</p>
               <p>Nina looked at him with a singular light in her eyes. She drew several long inspirations, as if struggling to gain breath enough to speak clearly. Her voice sounded cold and dissonant as it issued from her lips.</p>
               <p>"You think so now, perhaps, Godfrey Fenton, but wait<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6338-00000194"/> till you have time to reflect on the consequences of such an alliance. To you, a thousand a year will be poverty, and Mr. Lopez must share even that. But it is idle to speculate on impossibilities. I wish to speak only a few more words to you, sir. A presentiment I cannot rid myself of warns me that our fates are linked together for some evil purpose; and this day it had been far better for you if I had secured the inheritance I so lately believed was within my grasp. Convinced that you no longer love me, I should have gone upon my way and lived the gay life for which I am best fitted, but <emph>you</emph> have set on your friend to thwart my ambitious aspirations, in the hope that by ruining me you would serve the one you prefer to me; and I here renew the vow uttered once before, in a moment of overwhelming bitterness,—I will pursue you, Godfrey Fenton, till I find means to strike you down as you have stricken me; and such women as I am fail not when they set their very life upon a purpose!"</p>
               <p>She sunk back white and trembling, and Lopez interrupted the reply that arose to Fenton's lips. He peevishly said:</p>
               <p>"Why should we sit here to listen to the ravings of a half-demented girl? I believe her head is turned by the loss of the money she tried so hard to win. Take possession of the will, Manly, but delay action upon it as long as possible, for I still cherish the hope that the settlement which will render it null and void may turn up before it is admitted to probate."</p>
               <p>The lawyer obeyed, and Nina saw him put the package in his pocket without attempting to interfere, though she felt the impulse upon her to fly at him, snatch it from his hands, and tear into fragments the obnoxious codicil.</p>
               <p>She laughed aloud. Such a laugh as it was! It made every one shiver that heard it, and in the same monotonous tone again spoke:</p>
               <p>"Yes, take the will which brands me as a contemptible deceiver; but I am no worse than those who tempted me to do that which they knew would lead to my ruin. The plot was worthy of him who conceived it, and that man was Godfrey Fenton. I wish you joy of your lover, Miss Lopez; an <emph>honorable</emph> and unstained husband will you gain, if you can succeed in making him marry you; but, as I have already said, he will hardly go that far. He has flirted with others as seriously as with you, and nothing came of it. Like the rest, your time to be deserted will come. If you really wish your daughter to marry this man, Mr. Lopez, I advise you to have no delay; secure him at once, or it will be too late."</p>
               <p>"Thank you for your advice, Miss Gordon," replied that gentleman with a sneer; "but I think I can manage my affairs and those of my daughter without it. I have listened to enough of this impertinence. Get me away, Godfrey, before I say something I might be sorry to say to a woman. Open the door, Dick, and wheel my chair into the hall. Good-bye, fair termagant. I hope your disappointment to-day will not prove fatal to you."</p>
               <p>"It will not to <emph>me,</emph> sir; but it surely shall to some others I could name," was the defiant response made as Dick hastened to remove the paralytic from the room, followed by the rest of the party, with the exception of Mrs. Perkins.</p>
               <p>A few whispered words from Mrs. Langley induced her to pause and scan the wild face of Nina, and she softly closed the door on the others and drew near her.</p>
               <p>She had sunk back seemingly quite helpless, with an expression of angry despair upon her convulsed features that distorted all their beauty and filled her companion with alarm. Nina suddenly burst into wild cries, and fell into a violent hysteric spasm. Mrs. Perkins, with much effort, at length succeeded in carrying her to her bed, where<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6338-00000195"/> she loosened her clothing, and administered lavender and sal volatile.</p>
               <p>It was an hour before the paroxysms began to subside, and the sufferer lay panting and nerveless for a long time, with her eyes half closed and her pale lips tightly drawn over her teeth.</p>
               <p>Suddenly she seemed to remember something that vitally interested her; for she raised her head, looked around, and saw the waiting woman sitting at the foot of her bed intently regarding her. Nina feebly said:</p>
               <p>"I have something to attend to that must not be neglected. Bring me a bottle of wine. I must drink enough to nerve me for what lies before me. I shall not give way again, Mrs. Perkins. I feel my strength and will returning, and I shall do very well. Pray get me the wine without delay; bring me champagne. That will effectually remove this dreadful feeling of sinking that weighs me down."</p>
               <p>Much as Mrs. Perkins disliked Nina, she felt compassion for her in her broken-down and friendless condition; for she had heard of the sudden departure of the Bates family, and she knew that the young girl was left utterly alone to struggle with the overwhelming disappointment she had sustained.</p>
               <p>She hastened to bring the wine, though if she could have dreamed of the purpose for which its factitious aid was desired, she would sooner have seen Nina die for the want of it, than have been the agent to obtain it for her.</p>
               <p>She drank glass after glass till half the bottle was exhausted; then arose, and, with the woman's assistance, arranged her disordered dress, and prepared to go out Mrs. Perkins remonstrated:</p>
               <p>"You aint fit to go in the street, Miss Gordon. You are trembling with weakness now, and you may be took with another of them spells before you can walk any distance."</p>
               <p>Nina impatiently replied:</p>
               <p>"I am not going to walk. Call a carriage for me; there are plenty of them always to be had. I—I have an engagement to see a friend at five o'clock, and I must keep it,—a great deal depends on it. Will you perform this last service for me, Mrs. Perkins? It is not much to ask of you, and—and I am still able to reward you."</p>
               <p>"Of course I'll do it if you insist, Miss Gordon, but I don't want any pay from you for any little service I may do for you."</p>
               <p>"Well, go then, for I have no time to lose. It is half-past four now, and I have some distance to go."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins went, and returned in a few moments to say that a carriage was at the private entrance. Nina drew her thick crape veil over her wild-looking face and hastened to enter it. Whither she was going, or for what purpose, the woman could not divine, for the direction of Nina to the driver was given in so guarded a tone that she could not hear it. But she had little time to speculate on Nina's movements, for Mr. Lopez had left orders for her to pack up the personal effects of her late mistress, and have them ready for removal on the following day.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins was to return herself to the service of her darling young lady, taking Bijjer with her, to be cared for during the rest of his life."</p>
               <p>When the carriage had been driven half a mile, Nina again spoke to the coachman:</p>
               <p>"Go a mile on the road to Durfee's, and draw up on the road side."</p>
               <p>When they gained the place, she got out of the vehicle, and, holding her veil close over her face, again spoke to the man:</p>
               <p>"Wait here till I come back. I shall not be gone over half an hour, and I will pay you double fare to be quiet and<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC6338-00000196"/> patient. A friend lives in the woodland of whom I wish to take leave."</p>
               <p>The driver nodded carelessly, secured his reins, and got down to walk about a little. Nina made her way through a narrow pathway, which, a quarter of a mile distant, ended in an open space, in which a man with his hat drawn over his brows was pacing to and fro. He was apparently awaiting her appearance, for he immediately advanced toward her with alacrity, and lifting his hat, revealed the smooth, repulsive face of Sam. Wilkins.</p>
               <p>He jauntily said:</p>
               <p>"Ah! my fair heiress, I had nearly despaired of seeing you here this afternoon. I had almost come to the conclusion that in your elation at the golden shower that has fallen upon you, you had forgotten our appointment."</p>
               <p>His familiar manner was offensive to Nina, and she felt a sort of bitter triumph in the blow she was about to strike at him. She hastened to throw aside her veil and ask:</p>
               <p>"Is this the face of a successful plotter, Mr. Wilkins? I did not come before, because I was too ill to leave my room. Can you guess what has broken me down so utterly?"</p>
               <p>The bitter irony with which she spoke enlightened him at once, and he faintly gasped:</p>
               <p>"The old woman didn't go and throw you over at the last? The will was to be read this morning, and from your note, I inferred that all was right."</p>
               <p>"So I believed it was, when I wrote and made the appointment to meet you here this afternoon, that we might come to some arrangement about the exchange we intended to make. I have nothing to offer you in lieu of the stolen will, for Mrs. Hawks has added a codicil to hers, bequeathing her fortune to the poor of the county in which she was born."</p>
               <p>"Then what the devil brought you here at all, Miss Gordon?" he rudely asked. "You did not hope to bamboozle me into giving the will up to you without the reward you promised?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I did not expect that," she steadily replied, fixing her glittering eyes full upon his. "I only came hither to warn you against making any use of that instrument. If you move to restore it to the Lopez family, however large the reward their offer may be, I swear to you that I will expose the whole affair. If I bring ruin on myself by doing so, I will have you prosecuted for the theft you committed, and you will be sure of a long term in the penitentiary. I hope you clearly understand me, Mr. Wilkins?"</p>
               <p>"By the lord, if I don't, it is not for the want of plain speaking," he angrily replied. "You can't be in earnest, Miss Gordon? By exposing me, you would disgrace yourself forever; for of course the compact you made with me would not be kept back in such a condition of affairs as that."</p>
               <p>Nina coldly replied:</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> should not be punished, for you could prove nothing against me. I might be annoyed a little, but that I could bear; and I declare to you that I was never more bitterly in earnest in my life. I care little for the opinion of the world, for I have beauty and wit, which ensures me plenty of friends and defenders; but with you it is different. Your business depends on the estimation in which you are held as an honest man, and what I could and would tell must blight you forever."</p>
               <p>Wilkins looked at her set face, and saw that she was terribly in earnest. After a troubled pause, he insinuatingly said:</p>
               <p>"What would you say now, Miss Gordon, if I agree to<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6338-00000197"/> divide with you whatever the opposite party would give? I am sure it would be a handsome figure, for old Lopez is wild to get the will in his own possession. Manly has been pumping me in such a way, and offering such handsome terms on the part of the old man, that if it hadn't been for my admiration of you, I should really have been tempted to betray that I have the paper they are so keen after. They promise to keep dark, too, about the whole transaction. Come—be reasonable now; don't throw away the chance of a nice little independence, because you can't get the whole estate."</p>
               <p>Nina recoiled from his familiar approach as if he had been a leper. Lifting her white face to his, she stamped upon the ground, and imperiously cried:</p>
               <p>"I will die in a ditch sooner than accept a bribe to restore that which will make Inez Lopez the sole possessor of her aunt's fortune. Move in this matter if you dare, and I again asseverate that I will bring ruin upon you—worse than ruin—degradation—servile service in the State prison. Think of that, and relinquish all hope of making a speculation on the clever robbery you committed. Ha! ha! I am glad that somebody else has been outwitted as well as myself."</p>
               <p>Wilkins looked perfectly crestfallen. He whined:</p>
               <p>"I don't know how to deal with such a woman as you are, Miss Gordon. Since you cannot be harmed by the will coming to light, I can't see why you should insist that it shall be kept concealed. I have spent money already in this cursed affair, and how am I to get it back unless I sell the thing to those that would give a good price to get it? It isn't fair to treat a fellow so."</p>
               <p>"Quite as fair, Mr. Wilkins, as for you to steal the will for the purpose of making a speculation out of it. You are entitled to nothing for your cleverness, and nothing shall you have; I have made up my mind to that. But it grows late, and I must be back in town before night falls. I have given you fair warning of the consequences that will result from any attempt on your part to restore the will to its rightful owners, and I leave you to reflect upon them. You and I shall probably never meet again, unless you violate my commands. Should you do so, you may expect a dire Nemesis to swoop down upon you without delay. Good-evening, sir. I have said all that I came to say, and our interview must terminate."</p>
               <p>"Are you inexorable, Miss Gordon?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—as death itself: so beware that you do not act contrary to my positive commands."</p>
               <p>Wilkins saw from the expression of her face that she meant every word she uttered, and he struck his hand upon his forehead and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Then Heaven help me! for nearly all my savings have gone to feed the prodigality of the poor fool that gave me the clue to this villainy. Curse the luck! I wish with all my heart that I had never meddled in the affair at all."</p>
               <p>Nina's hard laugh rang out in reply, and in another moment she was gone.</p>
               <p>Threading her way rapidly through the woodland, she found the driver sitting on a stump whistling "Molly Bawn." Although the man surveyed her inquisitively, he said nothing, and before the sun had set she found herself again in her own apartment.</p>
               <p>Nina tried to think—to fix on some plan of action, but the crushing disappointment which had so suddenly ended all her dreams of grandeur, seemed to have paralyzed the springs of thought.</p>
               <p>Never before had she felt so utterly alone and deserted; and the memory of her late brilliant triumphs in society only added to her desolation. She bitterly regretted now that she had been so precipitate in breaking with the Bates<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6338-00000198"/> family. Had she acted with more caution she might have held Adolphus to his troth, and at least secured a safe position as his wife; but in the arrogance of her presumed fortune she had forever alienated even the faithful heart of Kitty, and there was no hope left in that quarter.</p>
               <p>Unable to endure the tumult of bitter feeling that surged in her bosom, she again had recourse to the champagne, and before her supper was brought in she had finished the bottle. A cup of tea was all she could take, and she then retired to her bed to toss half the night with restless moanings she had not strength to suppress.</p>
               <p>When Nina at last slept, frightful dreams of falling over precipices and tossing in a storm at sea kept her weary mind still on the strain, and she awoke feverish and scarcely refreshed by her unquiet slumbers.</p>
               <p>But she could not lie in bed; she must be up and preparing for her departure, for she was determined that Fenton should not find her there when he came to superintend the removal of Mrs. Hawks' effects.</p>
               <p>With the assistance of Mrs. Perkins, she packed her trunks and prepared to set out for New Haven, to Mrs. Lyme, as her only refuge, she felt that she must go, till she could look around and settle on some method of earning her bread, since that necessity was again laid upon her.</p>
               <p>A brief note from Kitty Bates had been left in her room, informing her that the large trunk containing the finery in which she had nightly figured for so many weeks past, was left in the care of the clerk, and Nina could claim it whenever she pleased. She sent for the young man and requested him to see her safely to the train, at the same time telling him that Mrs. Hawks' account, including her own bill, would be settled by her brother-in-law, Mr. Lopez.</p>
               <p>The clerk was very polite; he made every arrangement for her, and found an elderly gentleman travelling to New Haven in whose charge he placed her.</p>
               <p>With aching head and weary limbs, Nina was borne swiftly away, wondering why she felt so weak and nerveless, for she had never been sick in her life, and the premonitory symptoms of approaching illness gave her no warning.</p>
               <p>When they reached New Haven her escort found a carriage for her, in which she was driven to the door of her old friend, but on attempting to alight from it, she fainted and would have fallen if the driver had not caught her in his arms.</p>
               <p>Nina was taken into the house in this lifeless condition, and Mrs. Lyme had her at once conveyed to her old quarters, and placed in bed. She remained beside her till she came out of her swoon, in the hope that Nina could afford some explanation of her sudden appearance in this forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>But when consciousness returned she was evidently unable to enlighten her, and Mrs. Lyme saw that she was in the first paroxysm of a violent fever. A physician was hastily summoned to her side, and days of anxiety and nights of watching passed away, before Nina awoke to the knowledge of what was passing around her; and many more elapsed before she had strength to refer to the events of the last few months.</p>
               <p>When she at length did so, she informed her old friend only of such portions of them as did not too severely wound her own pride; and she accounted for her rupture with the Bates family, by saying that they were offended at her refusal to marry Adolphus.</p>
               <p>This surprised Mrs. Lyme, for she thought Nina intensely worldly, and she asked:</p>
               <p>"Was the young gentleman so very repulsive to you, my dear, that you could not weigh the advantages of the match against such girlish objections as you might have had to him? Mr. Bates is very rich, I believe, and you wrote to me that there are but two children."</p>
               <pb n="412-413" xml:id="VAC6338-00000199"/>
               <p>"Yes, they are reported rich, but I have reason to know that their commercial prosperity is not on the most stable foundation. In fact, I believe that Adolphus thought me likely to inherit a portion of Mrs. Hawks' fortune, or he would never have committed himself so far as to ask me to marry him."</p>
               <p>"Why should he have fancied that, Nina? You were known to her so short a time, that you could scarcely have cherished such a hope yourself."</p>
               <p>"It would scarcely have been strange if I had done so, Mrs. Lyme, for the old lady took a violent fancy to me; and, if others had not meddled between us in a most unwarrantable manner, I am almost sure that she would have provided handsomely for me. It is all over now, and I have nothing to look forward to but to begin again the weary struggle to earn my own living, by teaching unskilful fingers to make music odious and distasteful to me much as I once loved it. It is a hard fate for one constituted as I am, but I assure you that I consider it preferable to marrying Adolphus Bates for a home."</p>
               <p>"That is the right feeling, my dear child, and I am glad that you did not accept him. I think that I can find employment for you which will afford you more variety than merely teaching music. I was about to write to you, when you came here so unexpectedly, to lay before you the offer of a situation as governess, which I have received for you. The salary will be high and your duties light, as there will be but one pupil, and she is nearly grown."</p>
               <p>"I shall not accept it," said Nina," abruptly, "I have made up my mind to remain with you another year, at least,—that is, if you can give me my old position in your school."</p>
               <p>"We will talk on that subject, hereafter, Nina, when you are stronger and better able to take a correct view of what is best for yourself. You are flushing and trembling now, so I will leave this discussion for another day. I will give you your drops, and leave you to repose, for I see that you need it. Hereafter, when you are quite well and strong again, we will renew the subject, and I think you will change your decision after we have spoken together on this subject. Good night, my dear! get a good night's rest, and try to regain your bloom and beauty. I assure you that a fine field in which to display them, is opening before you."</p>
               <p>Nina would have detained her and heard all that she had to tell, but Mrs. Lyme was despotic, and she was left alone to muse over her late defeat, and wonder what her future lot was to be; but the narcotic drops she had taken soon asserted their power over her weakened frame, and she fell into a refreshing, life-renewing slumber, in which we will leave her and return to the Glades to see what has been developed there during the long weeks of Nina's illness and convalescence.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">DESERTED BY LOVE AND FORTUNE.</head>
               <p>NEWPORT was deserted, for autumn had put on its draperies of crimson and gold, and the latest seekers after health or pleasure had with the first frost winged their way to their distant homes, leaving the hotels nearly tenantless.</p>
               <p>But there was one who yet lingered there, in the daily diminishing hope that the fortune of his betrothed might be rescued from the jeopardy in which it stood, and their future union assured beyond a doubt.</p>
               <p>Fenton had labored assiduously to bring about this result,<pb n="414-415" xml:id="VAC6338-00000200"/> but alas! without effect. Blagdon was not to be found, and even his mother could throw no light on whither he had gone.</p>
               <p>Wilkins, under the dread inspired by Nina's threats, feared to betray the villainy of which he had been guilty, though every effort was made by Mr. Manly and the young lover to beguile from him a confession which would enable them to fasten on him the charge of having possessed himself of the will of Mr. Horton.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez offered a reward of twenty thousand dollars for its recovery, but that was not enough to tempt Wilkins to brave the exposure which he felt assured would ensue. He could not live in Europe in the style he aspired to on the interest of such a sum as that, and he knew that steady attention to his professional duties would ensure him much more in the course of a few years; so Mr. Wilkins balanced disgrace and respectability against each other, and unluckily for the interests of Inez, the latter outweighed the price offered by her father for the former.</p>
               <p>But Inez thought little of that. She lived in an enchanted paradise during those autumn weeks, in which Nina lay struggling back to life—to the life which, for herself and those her future actions were so deeply to affect, had far better have ended then. But "coldly, darkly strong is fate," and they all walked blindly forward in the path marked out for them to take.</p>
               <p>Fenton devoted to Inez all the hours he could spare from the business details he undertook for Mr. Lopez; and much as he had loved her before, he felt that day by day she became more dear, and more necessary to the happiness of his future life.</p>
               <p>Yet amid the deepest intoxication of his passion, Fenton admitted to himself that if the fortune of Mrs. Hawks eluded all his efforts to secure it for his betrothed, he dared not offend his imperious mother by making Inez his wife. He would not look to that result. He would hope against hope as long as that was possible, and then, if the worst came, he could but relinquish the girl whose love he knew would make his life purer and nobler, if he were only unselfish enough to brave narrow means for her sake.</p>
               <p>But this Fenton was not. He shuddered at the mere thought of the obscurity into which he must sink as the husband of one so slenderly provided for as Inez, burdened, too, as they must be by her helpless and exacting father.</p>
               <p>But these doubts and struggles were never permitted to ruffle the serenity of the hours the lovers passed together. In the presence of Inez, Fenton forgot everything but that she was the most adorable of women, and he the happy possessor of her tender and faithful heart.</p>
               <p>If Ben Crowder had been on the spot, his compunctions of conscience might have led to a confession of his share in the robbery, and his evidence would have forced Wilkins to produce the missing will; but a few days before the decease of Mrs. Hawks, his uncle had discovered the evil paths into which he was straying, and took immediate measures to remove him from the disreputable associates with whom Crowder had become entangled. He despatched him to New Orleans to attend to some important business which had been entrusted to Mr. Crampton in that city.</p>
               <p>Thus, to the infinite relief of Wilkins, his ally in crime was sent out of the way, precisely when his presence would have been most inconvenient to him.</p>
               <p>Time rolled around, bringing the golden days of October to a close, and the hazy, dream-like atmosphere of Indian Summer was swept away by a cold storm from the northeast, which scattered the gorgeous autumn foliage, leaving the lofty trees that encompassed the Glades bare and sere. Shipwrecks were scattered on the sea coast, and desolation<pb n="416-417" xml:id="VAC6338-00000201"/> brooded over the wintry-looking landscape, but to the heart of the lover of Inez Lopez a shipwreck of another kind came.</p>
               <p>Mr. Manly could no longer defer acting on the will of Mrs. Hawks, for it had become known that her estate was left to charities, and inconvenient inquiries began to be made as to the delay which had been already made in presenting it for probate. With much reluctance he took such steps as were necessary, and trustees were appointed by the county in which Mrs. Hawks was born, to take possession of the estate, and pay over such legacies as she had bequeathed to her niece and Mrs. Perkins.</p>
               <p>To the last Mr. Lopez declared that he would contest the will, but he finally relinquished this intention when assured by his lawyers that he would gain nothing by it. With inexpressible rage and mortification, he saw the wealth to which he felt assured his daughter was the legal heir, swept away from her, and he tried to console himself for his bitter disappointment by using still larger quantities of the fatal drug that was slowly undermining the very springs of life.</p>
               <p>He became more irritable every day, in spite of the efforts of both Inez and her lover to brighten his broken and weary life; and but for the sustaining presence of Fenton, and the anticipation of the bright future to be shared with him, Inez must have sunk beneath the trials her father daily inflicted upon her.</p>
               <p>But the spring of happiness in her young heart defied reverses of fortune or fractiousness of temper, as long as she believed herself the chosen one of the man to whom she was so ardently attached.</p>
               <p>Inez did not remark that Fenton no longer spoke of their speedy union as a certainty. He constantly received letters from his mother, which he never showed to her, and she could not fail to detect that each one seemed to depress him more deeply. Those letters were stringent commands from Mrs. Markland to return to Mississippi without delay, for Guy Denham and his sister had reached home; and a flirtation, as his aunt called it, had sprung up between Denham and Opal Hastings, which threatened to interfere with her son's claims in that quarter.</p>
               <p>So long as Fenton cherished the hope that Inez would eventually succeed to her grandfather's fortune he was indifferent to this; but when it seemed certain that the estate was irrevocably gone, he began to think it most unwise in himself to sacrifice his future prospects, and lose all chance of winning Miss Hastings, with the great wealth she would inherit.</p>
               <p>Fenton pitied himself—he cursed his fate; but he finally decided that he must go or forfeit his mother's favor, thus entailing ruin on himself.</p>

               <head type="sub">A BITTER PARTING.—WILL HE BE TRUE?</head>
               <p>ON a cold, blustering evening in November, Fenton set out for the Glades to warn Inez of the necessity which forced him, <emph>for a season,</emph> to leave her. He had no intention of telling her the whole truth; that would be too severe a blow to deal her trusting heart at once. He meant to use his best efforts to soften his mother, and, if possible, gain her consent to his marriage with Inez, though he had little hope of succees.</p>
               <p>If Mrs. Markland could only be induced to continue his present liberal allowance after their union, he would return and redeem his troth before the winter ended. If she<pb n="418-419" xml:id="VAC6338-00000202"/> refused to do this, Inez must gradually learn the blight that had fallen on her happiness; for Fenton could not, he dared not, lay bare before her the wretched doubts and uncertainties that filled his own mind.</p>
               <p>With the feeling of a criminal about to receive sentence, Fenton dismounted at the door of the old house and demanded admittance. Mrs. Perkins opened it, carrying Bijou in her arms and followed by Don Bobtail. By her efforts a permanent truce had been effected between the two pets, and they now lived together in perfect amity. The woman herself looked far happier than during her days of attendance on Mrs. Hawks, and she was evidently glad to welcome Fenton, for she blithely said:</p>
               <p>"Miss Inez is playing backgammon with her pa, but now you have come, Mr. Fenton, she'll have a holiday, and Mr, Lopez will put up with me for an antagonist. He can beat me easy enough, and that is all he cares for."</p>
               <p>In a low tone, Fenton replied:</p>
               <p>"Be sure to interest him sufficiently to allow me a long talk with Inez, Mrs. Perkins, for I have something important to say to her to-night."</p>
               <p>"So you always have, sir; but I hope there's nothing wrong? You don't look like yourself this evening."</p>
               <p>"Don't I? Well, that is easily accounted for; I am chilled through and a little tired, for I have had a great deal to attend to to-day. Nothing has gone right of late, and I am a little out of sorts—that is all."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Perkins advanced a step nearer, and in a mysterious tone said:</p>
               <p>"Don't be fretting, Mr. Fenton, about the trustees taking possession of the money Miss Inez ought to have, for somehow I feel sure that she'll get it yet. There's a Providence, you know, sir, that rules all things for good to them that trust in it, and I know that things will come right yet for my dear young lady. I dream every night that I see her decked with pearls and diamonds and dressed in gold cloth, and I never had such dreams about any one that they did not come to great good fortune."</p>
               <p>With a constrained laugh, Fenton said:</p>
               <p>"I only wish I had your faith, Mrs. Perkins, for it would be worth a great deal to me just now. I shall find Mr. Lopez and his daughter in the usual room, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; I came to take you to the new parlor Miss Inez has had fitted up. She kept it secret, as a surprise for you when it was all ready, and a pretty taste the dear child has. Oh, Mr. Fenton, you will have the sweetest wife in the world when you and she are married, and I do hope that you'll be as happy together as the angels in Heaven. I am sure you both deserve it."</p>
               <p>"She does, I know, but as to myself, I am afraid there is not much of the angelic about me. But lead the way, if you please, for I am impatient to see Inez with her new surroundings."</p>
               <p>Thus admonished, Mrs. Perkins crossed the hall and unclosed a door opposite to the one opening into the apartment of Mr. Lopez. A scene was revealed that struck the visitor as the perfection of comfort and good taste.</p>
               <p>The room was of medium size, with a large bay window on one side draped with crimson hangings. The floor was covered with a Brussels carpet, the prevailing hue of which was the same rich, warm color, and on the hearth a bright wood fire was burning.</p>
               <p>The furniture was all new and selected with perfect taste, and two large chairs were drawn up in front of the hearth, with a table between them on which the backgammon board rested.</p>
               <p>Inez had not been permitted by her irate father to wear mourning for her aunt, after he felt assured that she had<pb n="420-421" xml:id="VAC6338-00000203"/> been disinherited; she was dressed in a crimson merino, embroidered with black, with a knot of ribbon of the same hue drawn through the massive folds of her raven hair. She looked magnificently handsome, though rather weary, and her father was vociferously shaking the dice in his box before making his throw.</p>
               <p>"Sixes twice in succession! I declare, Inez, such luck as that is enough to defeat the best playing. But if I get doublets in my turn, I will beat you yet, though the odds are so much against me."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will get them, papa, for I do not care to win. Oh! here is Godfrey at last!" and she sprang up with a smile of such beaming welcome, that sad as Fenton's heart was, he was thrilled with delight.</p>
               <p>"So—you have come at the eleventh hour," said Mr. Lopez, with a flash of his black eyes, which showed that he was not in one of his best moods. "A short time back we did not have to wait till evening to welcome you to the Glades, Godfrey; and after Inez had taken the pains to fix up this room as a pleasant surprise for you, I began to think that you did not intend to come and see it till after its first freshness was gone."</p>
               <p>"That was speculating on impossibilities, my dear sir, for you knew that I should not fail to come hither at the first practicable moment. I have been constantly engaged for the last few days, and I have only snatched a few hours from business to come out now. This room is indeed a charming surprise, for it is fitted up with extreme taste. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as your daughter intended you should when she furnished it."</p>
               <p>"Oh! it wasn't done for <emph>me.</emph> I like my own den better than any other place; but in the new state of things that will be inaugurated with my daughter's marriage with you, I agreed that we must have some of the disused rooms painted and furnished up. Inez has done her part very deftly, and the expense has not been greater than we could afford with our increased income. A thousand a year is wealth to us, you know, after living so long on little more than half that sum."</p>
               <p>Fenton winced a little at the reference to a union which he had reluctantly made up his mind would never take place. But he smiled, and replied:</p>
               <p>"It was well thought of, I am sure; and I am most flattered and grateful."</p>
               <p>"Of course, of course. But pray enlighten me as to the nature of the important business you spoke of. Since my affairs were so well settled by you, I had no idea that you had any other occupation than to amuse yourself."</p>
               <p>With a half sigh, Fenton sunk into the chair Mrs. Perkins placed for him, and slowly said:</p>
               <p>"Until a few hours ago that was the case; but an imperative summons from my mother, who is ill, has reached me, and I must set out for Mississippi to-morrow. I have been busy making arrangements for my departure, or I should have been here many hours ago."</p>
               <p>At this announcement Inez sunk back, pale and trembling, and her father angrily said:</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you, Mr. Fenton. I have been under the impression that, before you leave for your Southern home, you would be united to my daughter. I hope that the loss of her fortune has nothing to do with this change in your intentions?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, papa," remonstrated Inez, in a faint tone, "pray do not speak thus. You wrong Godfrey cruelly by such an insinuation."</p>
               <p>Fenton turned toward her, and fervently said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, he does wrong me, Inez; for, if ever a man adoringly loved a woman, I love you. The dearest hope of my<pb n="422-423" xml:id="VAC6338-00000204"/> life is to call you mine, but it is right for me to do all that lies in my power to gain my mother's consent to our union before it takes place. Her letters leave me no room to hope that anything can be accomplished unless we meet face to face, and I set my will against hers in such an encounter as must eventually give me the victory. Besides, she is really ill; she has summoned me to her bed-side; and, if I fail to go at once, she may die, refusing me her forgiveness for my disobedience."</p>
               <p>Inez replied before her father could make his voice heard:</p>
               <p>"You are quite right, Godfrey. Your mother has the first claim on you, and you must hasten to her side. You will come back, I feel sure, bearing with you her consent to the completion of our happiness."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, dear love; I knew that you would be just to me," breathed Fenton, in his softest tone.</p>
               <p>But Lopez, in an irritated voice, cried out:</p>
               <p>"What does your mother mean by objecting to <emph>my</emph> daughter as your wife? If my fortunes have fallen, I was once a Cuban grandee, and some of the azure blood of Spain flows in my veins. Inez is a fitting mate for a prince; and it is sheer impertinence in any American woman to oppose the union of her son with the last of my race. This is the first time I have heard an insinuation of such a possibility, Mr. Godfrey Fenton."</p>
               <p>The young man controlled his temper, and steadily replied:</p>
               <p>"I have not concealed from your daughter, sir, that the heart of my mother is set on making a match for me with a young favorite of her own. But Inez also knows that I am devoted to her alone; that I go to my home but to overcome my mother's desire to see me give my hand to the one she has herself chosen for me. I shall speedily return, bearing her consent to claim Miss Lopez as my wife. If I did not believe this, sir, I should not have courage to sever myself from Inez even for a day, for words would fail to tell you how much she is to me—how impossible it would be to give her up."</p>
               <p>Inez gave him an eloquent look of thanks, of perfect and unflinching trust, before which the heart of Fenton sunk like lead in his bosom. He felt that he was but paving the way to the relinquishment of that which was necessary to elevate him to the noble stature of manhood he might have attained under the sweet influence of this gentle and pure creature,—so true herself, that she was incapable of doubting him.</p>
               <p>Lopez was impressed by Fenton's words and manner, and he less harshly said:</p>
               <p>"You speak fairly enough, Mr. Fenton, but if I had been before aware that an objection would be raised to the admission of my daughter into your family, I should never have permitted things to come to such a crisis as this. I scarcely think that you have treated me well, sir."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to have offended you, Mr. Lopez, but if you will recall your own youthful days, with the fiery impulses that controlled them, perhaps you will be able to find some excuse for me. I loved Inez from the first hour of meeting, and you would scarcely expect me to place an obstruction in my own path, by confessing that the will of my mother ran counter to my own. I will not doubt my power to overcome her opposition to my marriage with your daughter, and I but seek her presence now for that purpose. I entreat that you will not add to the wretchedness of this parting, by showing mistrust, which, I assure you, I do not deserve."</p>
               <p>Lopez did recall his own experience. He remembered how he had stolen the wife whose heart he had broken, from<pb n="424-425" xml:id="VAC6338-00000205"/> a doting old father, and his wrath softened a little. He more calmly said:</p>
               <p>"It is useless to quarrel now, Godfrey. Things have gone so far between you and Inez, that it is impossible for you to recede with honor, and nothing is left us but to confide in that. If it fails in the trial, Inez will be no child of mine, if she does not cast you from her heart as a villain, unworthy of faith or confidence."</p>
               <p>"Those are hard words, Mr. Lopez."</p>
               <p>"Not unless you feel within your soul that you intend to deserve them. But I have said enough; Inez has no one to defend her but a wretched, paralytic old father; and, if you do not mean honorably by her, you feel assured of perfect impunity. Go your way, Godfrey Fenton; and may God deal with you as you do with my poor child!"</p>
               <p>Fenton did not say amen to this. He was conscience-stricken, and at that moment he felt as if he was the basest and most treacherous of men. For a few moments he felt tempted to marry Inez before he left, and brave the consequences of his mother's anger; but his cautiousness, his love of splendor, came to the rescue, and he evasively replied:</p>
               <p>"Inez will need no defender from me, sir, for I aspire to become all in all to her. After a few brief weeks of absence, you will welcome me back here when I come to claim the greatest happiness a mortal man can possess—the heart and hand of the woman he feels to be worthy to claim the first place in his affections."</p>
               <p>"And they shall be yours, Godfrey," said Inez, with a radiant smile, as she laid her soft palm on his. "Go to your mother without delay; for if she is ill, she needs your presence near her. And be sure that in your absence, I shall think of you with perfect love and trust. My father's doubts have no weight with me, for I know too well the truth and nobility of your nature, to believe them well founded."</p>
               <p>Fenton reverently lifted to his lips the hand so confidingly given to him, and huskily murmured:</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my own, my love, my life. Oh, Inez, should anything happen to sever us, I shall be the most lost—the most wretched of men! But I will overcome every obstacle to our perfect union. I will make my mother so much in love with you that she will as eagerly look forward to claiming you as her daughter, as I do to claiming you as my wife."</p>
               <p>As Fenton thus spoke, he drew Inez toward the bay window which formed a large projection from the room; the heavy curtains fell partially behind them, shielding them from the angry observation of Mr. Lopez. That gentleman sharply rang his hand bell, and Mrs. Perkins appeared at the door. He ordered her to take the place of Inez at the backgammon board, and soon the rattling of the dice allowed the lovers to converse in perfect freedom in the recess to which they had retired.</p>
               <p>A shiver crept through the sensitive frame of Inez as she looked out on the skeleton arms of the lofty trees, now entirely denuded of their foliage; and in spite of the assurance so recently uttered, a chill presentiment of approaching evil thrilled to her heart. For a few moments that dreary autumn landscape, stripped of all its verdant beauty, seemed to her a type of the future that was lowering before her.</p>
               <p>But the ardent words of Fenton soon dispelled such fancies, and she blushed and trembled at the earnest passion in his tones as he vowed eternal fidelity to her again and again. Inez had no power to resist such pleadings, and when he asked her to give him a last pledge that they would be true to each other, she laid her slender hand in<pb n="426-427" xml:id="VAC6338-00000206"/> his, and together they repeated a form of betrothal, which to her was as binding as if the priest had spoken the nuptial benediction over them.</p>
               <p>Her head sunk upon his breast, and the compact was sealed by pressing his lips to hers. Carried away by the madness of the moment, if a clergyman had been present, and it had been possible to make Inez lawfully his own without the preliminary of a license, Fenton would have done so without a thought as to future results.</p>
               <p>In that hour he was deeply in earnest, and he renewed his vow to himself to trample on impossibilities, if that were necessary to the redemption of the pledge he had just renewed. Fenton was entranced, yet most wretched in those fleeting moments which a weird fate whispered him were the last he should ever enjoy with the idol of his vain and weak heart; but to Inez they were filled with supreme happiness, in spite of the separation that must so speedily come.</p>
               <p>She remembered that she would have his letters, and they would compensate her in some degree for the pains of absence, and she softly said:</p>
               <p>"You will write to me every day, Godfrey. Promise to keep a journal of all that happens to you, and forward it to me as it is written."</p>
               <p>"I will write to you, dearest. I will pour forth all the feelings of my heart, but I cannot promise to keep a journal. I never could jot down things as they occur; it is too dry and mechanical a proceeding for one of my temperament, and I have no talent for narration."</p>
               <p>"Then say to me whatever your heart prompts, Godfrey. To know what is passing there will be my highest ambition—my sweetest hope. I believe in you, Godfrey, and nothing shall dim my trust after what has just passed between us."</p>
               <p>"You may trust me, Inez, for I swear to do all that lies in the power of man to enable me to return hither speedily and joyfully as the bridegroom should, who comes to claim such a treasure as yourself. Oh! my darling, my adored, if anything should happen to sever us now, I shall be the most lost, the most wretched of men."</p>
               <p>Tears were standing in his expressive eyes; a few fell hot and heavy upon the hand he held tightly clasped in his own, and Inez, ignorant of the true source of anguish from which they were wrung, kissed them away, believing them to be the seal to his assurances of eternal devotion to herself.</p>
               <p>Yes, Fenton did love Inez Lopez well; but, alas! he loved himself better; and no one knew so well as Godfrey Fenton himself, that if his mother proved inexorable he would never have the manliness of purpose to wed Inez in defiance of her opposition.</p>
               <p>It was not marvellous then that his frame shook with the storm of doubt and anguish that wrung his heart in those parting moments. Inez believed truly that he suffered more than she herself did, and she made every effort to soothe and comfort him. Twilight began to gather over the landscape; the rattle of dice was succeeded by that of china, and the last communion of the lovers was interrupted by the voice of Mr. Lopez, saying:</p>
               <p>"I think you two have had time enough to say all the sweet things usual on such occasions, and I am getting hungry for my supper. Come, Inez, and make the tea."</p>
               <p>The drapery was put aside, and the lovers came into the lighted room. Inez approached her father, kissed him, and softly said:</p>
               <p>"Godfrey and I understand each other perfectly now, dear papa, and you are to have no more fears for my happiness. I have entrusted it to the keeping of my betrothed, and I am sure it will be perfectly safe."</p>
               <pb n="428-429" xml:id="VAC6338-00000207"/>
               <p>Fenton silently grasped the hand of the elder man, and Lopez seemed willing to accept the assurance thus offered, for he cheerfully said:</p>
               <p>"'All's well that ends well,' and I shall have something to look forward to in the return of Godfrey, and the realization of my brightest hopes for you, Inez. Drive dull care away shall be my motto for the future; so make me a cup of the fluid that 'cheers but not inebriates,' and in it I will pledge my confidence anew to my future son-in-law."</p>
               <p>They gathered around the tea-table, and Fenton made an effort to recover his usual gay composure. In this he was so far successful that Inez brightened beneath his influence, and the evening passed more cheerfully than its stormy commencement had promised.</p>
               <p>To Fenton these last hours were like those of the criminal whose fate approaches; for, disguise it as he might, the painful conviction remained on his mind, that on this night he was bidding farewell to the brightest hope of his life—to self-respect—to all that rendered existence most precious in his sight; and for what? That he might continue the career of indolent extravagance which had blunted his finer faculties, and rendered the talents he was conscious of possessing a useless gift. Ah! if a small portion of energy and perseverance had only been infused into him, how different his fate might have been; for, in spite of his many and great faults, Godfrey Fenton had within him the elements of something far nobler and higher than his faulty education had made him.</p>
               <p>His mother had assiduously trained him for the part she wished him to play upon the stage of life; but in doing this she had crushed out the germs of much that was of nobler significance than all the worldly success she had taught him to be the highest aim of man.</p>
               <p>Later in the evening they had some music. Inez played on her guitar, and Fenton joined his voice with hers in several duets. These were enjoyed by Mr. Lopez, who would even lay aside his beloved chess board to listen to the soft melodies breathed from his daughter's lips.</p>
               <p>Nine, ten, eleven sounded from the little time-piece upon the mantel, and Fenton reluctantly arose to bid them farewell. He offered his hand to her father, and Inez summoned all her courage to sustain her through the painful ordeal of parting; but a cord seemed tightening around her heart, and for a few moments she felt as if suffocating.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lopez asked:</p>
               <p>"When are we to look for you back, Godfrey? You can set a limit to your absence, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"In six weeks—two months at the latest," was the prompt reply. "Then we can have a rare Christmas festival."</p>
               <p>"Inez shall be ready for the wedding by the time you come back."</p>
               <p>"I thank you for the assurance, sir. It makes me most happy."</p>
               <p>And, turning toward Inez, Fenton impulsively encircled her trembling form with his arm, and, dropping on his knees before her father, he cried out:</p>
               <p>"Bless us now as your children, Mr. Lopez, that I may carry away with me the assurance that you bear no ill-will toward me for what I am compelled to do."</p>
               <p>Inez sank down beside him, and Lopez said, with a laugh:</p>
               <p>"I think this rather a melo-dramatic proceeding for so sensible a man as you are, Godfrey; but if you value my blessing, it is yours; and if I were a better man I would pray to Heaven to shower blessings down on you and my dear girl, who certainly deserves a good husband to repay her for all her kindness to her irritable and often unmanageable father."</p>
               <pb n="430-431" xml:id="VAC6338-00000208"/>
               <p>He laid a wasted hand on the head of each, and, stooping forward, kissed Inez on the brow with more emotion than he often evinced.</p>
               <p>Fenton arose, gave the palpitating form he held tightly clasped in his arms one fervent embrace, kissed her pale lips, and rushed into the hall.</p>
               <p>Dick was ready with his horse, and tossing him a piece of gold, he rode away in the night at so furious a pace that the sober coachman shook his head and muttered:</p>
               <p>"I wonder what he expects to happen to that horse after such headlong racing as that? and the night so overcast, too, that the creature can just see how to make his way through the woods without running against the trees. It's lucky the leaves are all gone, or something might happen to both horse and rider.</p>
               <p>In spite of Dick's apprehensions, Fenton reached Newport in safety, and completed his preparations for an early start in the morning.</p>
               <p>After again reading over his mother's last letter, he paced the floor through all the remainder of the night, alternately cursing his fate and raging at himself, but unable to make up his mind to an irreparable breach with the parent who held his worldly interests in her grasp.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland told him that she was very ill, but in his heart Fenton believed it to be a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign> to bring him more speedily to her presence; but, true or false, he felt that he must go and leave behind him all that was most precious to him in life, save the gold he hoped to win by keeping in the good graces of the imperious despot who had ruled him from his boyhood.</p>
               <p>On the following morning Fenton set out for Natchez, and travelled as rapidly as railroads and steamboats enabled him to do till he gained the place of his destination.</p>

               <head type="sub">NINA SETS OUT FOR THE SOUTH.</head>
               <p>THE perfect physical organization of Nina Gordon enabled her to recover rapidly from her illness when the reaction really commenced, and she was soon able to leave her room and mingle as formerly with the family.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme was unvarying in her kindness, but until her patient was quite strong and blooming again, she did not recur to the subject of Nina's engagement as a governess, of which she had spoken during her convalescence.</p>
               <p>Nina often led to the subject herself, and always protested that she would never consent to go South at all, unless the mysterious uncle who had educated her should write to invite her to take up her abode in his house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme quietly evaded all her efforts to learn by whom the offer of a situation had been made till she thought her protégée sufficiently restored to bear the journey she felt assured she would eventually take.</p>
               <p>On a bright day in October, she sought Nina in her own apartment, bearing with her a letter she had received only the day before. The young girl threw down the book she was reading, and rising from her lounging position on the sofa, said, in an animated tone:</p>
               <p>"I see that the time has come, at last, for the long-promised enlightenment as to who wants my services as teacher and model for his only daughter. Is it not so, dear Mrs. Lyme?"</p>
               <p>"You are right, Nina. I have come to have a serious talk with you about your future, for I feel the deepest interest in your success in life. You have talents and beauty, and in spite of the failure of your friends to claim you, I<pb n="432-433" xml:id="VAC6338-00000209"/> think you can carve out a desirable destiny for yourself. You can, at least, by a few years of light labor, secure the means of independence; for it is very rare indeed, that a girl of twenty, has a thousand dollars a year offered her for doing so little as will be required of you, besides having the advantage of a luxurious home, in which every want will be seduously attended to."</p>
               <p>"A thousand a year! That is a temptation indeed, Mrs. Lyme, and far more, I am sure, than my services will be worth. But what am I to do to earn this magnificent salary?"</p>
               <p>"You will instruct a girl of sixteen in music, French, drawing and composition. For the last, her father thinks she has great talents. I know you to be quite capable of filling the situation, and I am sure you will accept it."</p>
               <p>"Yes—I can do all that; but I had far rather remain here in my old position, if you will only consent to keep me. I looked foward so long to playing a brilliant <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rôle</foreign> in southern society, that my pride shrinks from the humiliation of going among those haughty people as a paid dependent. I am afraid that the large salary offered will scarcely tempt me to desert you, if you will only let me stay."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme shook her head.</p>
               <p>"Why should you speak of yourself as a dependent, Nina, when your position will be as honorable a one as a woman can fill? The dearest hope of this wealthy father will be entrusted to your care, and you will be treated in every respect as an equal. I really think that no position which one of our sex can fill is more independent than the one which is offered you. These people are not of the vulgar rich, who presume to look down on an accomplished lady as an inferior, who does for their children what they are incapable of doing themselves. You will be engaged with your pupil but a few hours in the morning, and after that time you will be free to employ yourself as you please. You will have your own apartment, with more personal attendance than you have been accustomed to; the use of the carriage when you desire it; and in the house of a wealthy southern planter you will meet with a constant succession of guests. You may find there all that a woman needs to make her happy. I am sure that you will have an opportunity to make a brilliant marriage."</p>
               <p>Having thus summed up all the advantages that might accrue to her protégée, Mrs. Lyme paused, expecting a very different reply from the one she received.</p>
               <p>Nina's brow clouded, and she defiantly said:</p>
               <p>"I will not marry for money, if that is what you mean. If I had been willing to do so, I should have accepted Adolphus Bates, for I believe he was infatuated enough to have taken me without a penny. Oh! Mrs. Lyme, don't ask me to go South as a governess. After all my dreams of grandeur when removed to that sunny land, it is too great a fall. I could not bear it."</p>
               <p>"Nina, this is nonsense; you must get over such absurd objections, for you may never have such an offer again in your life. Even if I could restore you to your former position in my school, I could not afford to pay you more than half the salary that is offered; but that is quite out of the question. Your place has been filled, and I could not discharge Miss Delaphine merely for the purpose of installing you. She is a competent teacher, and I cannot be so unjust to her."</p>
               <p>"Let her go South in my place, then. She is quite as capable of filling the situation as I am. An order was sent to you for a teacher, and all you have to do is to fill it to the best of your ability. Is it not so, dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"No—for the situation was offered to <emph>you,</emph> and I have no<pb n="434-435" xml:id="VAC6338-00000210"/> authority to employ another. If you decline it, I must write to that effect."</p>
               <p>Nina's eyes widened with surprise, and her interest was at once aroused.</p>
               <p>"To <emph>me!</emph> Who on earth is it that knows anything of me down there? for you have not yet mentioned the name of the liberal person who is so anxious to secure me as a model for his daughter?"</p>
               <p>"Have I not named him? It was an inadvertence on my part. Mr. William Hastings, of Mississippi, is the—"</p>
               <p>Nina interrupted her by an exclamation of astonishment and triumph:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hastings! Why did you not name him before, madam? I should at once have accepted an offer from <emph>him,</emph> even if the salary had been far less than what he offers. Oh! this is more than I could have hoped for Better than I dreamed could ever be my fortune again."</p>
               <p>The old lady stared at her in mute surprise, but she presently found voice to ask:</p>
               <p>"What do you know of this gentleman that makes you so willing to accept a position you so positively declined to fill? You are a strange enigma to me, Nina."</p>
               <p>"But I understand myself perfectly. What do I know of Mr. Hastings? Let me see—very little, I believe, but I am acquainted with some friends and neighbors of his that I am most anxious to meet again. I met with them this summer at Newport, and I shall find a residence near them very agreeable. I heard both Mr. Hastings and his daughter spoken of in such a way as deeply interested me. So—Opal Hastings is to be my pupil, and I shall have the opportunity to fill her mind with anything I may choose to put in it. Of course I shall do my best to enlighten her mind and improve her knowledge of the world. Eureka! I believe I was born under a lucky star!"</p>
               <p>Her exulting excitement would not be repressed, and Mrs. Lyme regarded her with wondering eyes. She gravely said:</p>
               <p>"You will do your duty by this young lady, I am sure, Nina, or I would not venture to recommend you; though, by the way, I was not asked to do that. I was only requested to offer Miss Nina Gordon the position of governess in Mr. Hastings' family, with the salary I have named. The friends you referred to just now must have spoken of you and interested him in you. Did you give them any reason to suppose that such an application would be successful with yourself?"</p>
               <p>Nina tossed her head half contemptuously:</p>
               <p>"Indeed I did not; for then I was perfectly satisfied to remain with Mrs. Hawks. She was as fond of me as if I had been her own daughter, and but for the machinations of the man who hoped to marry her niece, I should now have had wealth at my command. I owe <emph>him</emph> a debt that I intend to pay with interest at some future day; but we won't talk of that now. I am so enchanted with this unexpected opening for a future career, that I can think of nothing else. Will you write to Mr. Hastings, or shall I do it myself? Perhaps he will be better pleased to hear from me; as he can then judge of my style of composition and see what a pretty epistolary effort I am capable of making."</p>
               <p>"It may be as well; you can write if you choose."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I shall choose. By the way, do you know that I am said to resemble his daughter? I have been told of it more than once."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme unclosed her lips to give utterance to some thought that struck her, but shut them again resolutely, and after a pause said:</p>
               <p>"It is very singular that you should have been selected as the only one wanted, especially as you were not recommended<pb n="436-437" xml:id="VAC6338-00000211"/> mended to Mr. Hastings. Has it occurred to you that this gentleman may know something of your family, Nina?"</p>
               <p>She shrugged her shoulders, and with a constrained laugh replied:</p>
               <p>"Oh! I am not going out in the world on such a mission as that of Japhet in search of a father, I assure you. Since my uncle chooses to conceal himself behind a curtain of mystery, I shall make no effort to pull it aside. If I am acknowledged at all, it must be through his own volition, for my pride will never permit me to inquire into what he evidently wishes to conceal. If Mr. Hastings does know him, and if he should volunteer any information on the subject of my family, I shall listen to him, but that will be all."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme regarded her searchingly, for she had little faith in this professed indifference to her own antecedents on the part of Nina. She remembered too well the rebellious struggles against the conviction that she was to be left to make her own way in life, after being reared and educated in such a manner as to delude her into the belief that she was the heiress of great wealth.</p>
               <p>She gravely said:</p>
               <p>"It may be as well, perhaps, for you to cherish this indifference toward your family, since it is evident that your uncle has given up all idea of claiming you. But I think he still interests himself about you, and this offer from Mr. Hastings, coming so soon after your term of probation expired, almost convinces me that through the influence of Mr. Fairlie, he has been induced to employ you as his daughter's governess."</p>
               <p>"So you still believe that my uncle wishes to play the part of my guardian-angel, though he is not liberal enough to provide for me himself. Well, if it is so, I have much to thank him for, in selecting the family of Mr. Hastings as the one in which I am to take up my new abode. In no other one would I have consented to occupy such a position."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that you are reasonable at last, though why such a preference should be accorded to this particular family, I am at a loss to imagine."</p>
               <p>"Have I not explained to you that I already know several of their friends? That I am interested in what I have heard of both father and daughter, and besides I am curious to see the girl who is said to look like me—are not these sufficient reasons, dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"Since they satisfy you, my dear, they will suffice for me. Do you wish to see the last letter written to me by Mr. Hastings? I have it in my pocket."</p>
               <p>"By all means, if you will allow me to do so. I sometimes fancy that the clue to the real character of the writer can be found in the strokes of the pen on the paper, and I may be able to divine something of my new patron by seeing how he minds his p's and q's."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme smiled at the conceit, and drew the envelope from her pocket. Nina seized on it, and, rapidly opening it, drew forth a scented sheet of paper, on which the following lines were traced in a clear, but feeble-looking hand:</p>

                              <dateline>SILVERMERE, near NATCHEZ, October 2, 18—.</dateline>
                           </opener>
                           <p>DEAR MADAM:—It was with much regret that I heard of the illness of Miss Gordon. I hoped that, by this time, she would have been domesticated in my family, and my daughter's studies again in progress, under her supervision.</p>
                           <p>Opal has hitherto been instructed by a gentleman who lives as teacher in a neighboring family, and her mental training has been such as boys usually receive. She has had some musical advantages, but not of the highest order; and for that, and for companionship with one of her own<pb n="438-439" xml:id="VAC6338-00000212"/> sex, who is young enough to be an associate and friend, have I desired to secure Miss Gordon.</p>
                           <p>"My daughter speaks French with a pure accent, and draws passably. I wish Miss Gordon to bring with her a selection from the French classics, which they can read together; for it is my desire that Opal shall acquire a critical knowledge of the language which was that of her ancestors, on the maternal side.</p>
                           <p>"By the time this reaches you, I hope that your young friend will be sufficiently restored to undertake the journey south, under the care of a friend of mine who will be in New York by the 10th of November. Mr. Matson is a merchant of Natchez, who goes north on business connected with his firm, and he will give every attention to his fair charge.</p>
                           <p>"You can inform Miss Gordon, that her preparations must be completed, and herself ready to return with him, by that time—that is, if she accepts the situation I have offered her, and of that, I will not permit myself to doubt.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <salute>Respectfully,</salute>
                              <signed>W. F. HASTINGS.</signed>

               </q>
               <p>Nina read it carefully through, and then inquisitively scanned the writing. Mrs. Lyme asked, with a smile:</p>
               <p>"What do you make of it, my dear? It is a very satisfactory epistle, I think."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I must say it is. It was very thoughtful in him to provide me with an escort on so long a journey, and I feel duly grateful. Do you wish me to play the part of the seer, and tell you what I think of the man who traced these lines, merely from the appearance of the writing?"</p>
               <p>"If you can do so. And when you know him, I shall be glad to learn if your previsions prove correct."</p>
               <p>"Well, this is my opinion. Mr. Hastings is an amiable gentleman; I mean the last word in its fullest acceptation; but he is weak; easily led away by impulse, and as easily influenced by others. He is luxurious in his tastes—witness this scented paper, with its fine cream laid surface. He is proud and fond of this 'sole daughter of his house and heart,' and I would wager any amount that he is ruled by his wife."</p>
               <p>"He does not once refer to Mrs. Hastings. Why should you imagine that?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! because he is the sort of man who yields most readily to female influence; and I have been told that his wife is a most peculiar and exacting person."</p>
               <p>"Then you did not gather all your impressions from the writing alone?"</p>
               <p>Nina laughed, replaced the letter in its dainty envelope, and gave it back to Mrs. Lyme without replying to the last question. She presently said:</p>
               <p>"I shall have no time to lose, for but two more weeks remain to me to get my wardrobe in order. I am quite strong and well now, and I will set about my preparations at once."</p>
               <p>"I agree with you that no time is to be lost; and here is a check for your first quarter's salary. It was enclosed in the letter, with a small memorandum, stating that if you should need more, Mr. Matson would advance it to you. Very thoughtful and liberal, I must say it was, on the part of Mr. Hastings."</p>
               <p>Nina laughingly replied:</p>
               <p>"I told you that he is a gentleman; but such liberality is princely. I am sure that I shall quite adore this fine old Southern gentleman, with tons of gold, and cotton bolls, and darkies at command."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see that your fine spirits have returned, my dear, and I hope the best fortune will attend you in your new career."</p>
               <pb n="440-441" xml:id="VAC6338-00000213"/>
               <p>A faint shadow flitted over her face, but she gaily said:</p>
               <p>"Thanks, dear madam. I mean to do my best to secure it, so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">allons</foreign> for the sunny South, for I am quite elated with the prospects opening before me. I am going out at once to make such purchases as are necessary for a beginning, for I must have a new and most bewitching set of dresses made up, if I am to set my cap at the eligible <foreign xml:lang="FRA">parti</foreign> you are so anxious for me to secure."</p>
               <p>"I hope that you will find some one you can love, Nina; I did not mean that you should give your hand in exchange for money, though you seem so to interpret my words."</p>
               <p>"Did I? Well, I beg your pardon for misunderstanding you. Of course, I shall find my true love there, or nowhere else in the world."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme kissed her and left the room. Nina, in place of arraying herself for the proposed shopping expedition, sunk down on the sofa, with clouded brow and compressed lips, to think over this new phase in her destiny.</p>
               <p>Her small hands clenched themselves till the rosy nails were almost buried in the flesh, and she bitterly muttered:</p>
               <p>"Yes, I shall find <emph>him</emph> there! Not my true love, but false—doubly, trebly false to me, to Inez Lopez, and to that other one to whom he has so long been bound. Yet knowing this, I cannot tear his image from my heart. Oh! Godfrey Fenton, what glamour have you cast over me to bind me to you with bonds of steel, when I know, alas! but too well, that another has usurped the place I once held in your fickle heart? You shall yet return to me; I swear it by all the gods! and these people among whom I am going, shall be the tools in my hands to bring you to my feet again. But now I must be up and doing. I must make myself ready for the conflict I foresee."</p>
               <p>Nina sprang to her feet, threw on her bonnet and mantle and went on her pleasing errand; for she was too very a woman not to delight in being able to indulge her taste in selecting rich and expensive articles of dress.</p>
               <p>Mantua makers were set to work; and by the time the expected summons came from Mr. Matson, naming the day on which he would set out on his return home, Nina was in readiness to accompany him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lyme accompanied her to New York, to place her under the care of the merchant, who was found at the St. Nicholas. Mr. Matson was a gray-haired, elderly man, very grave and quiet in his demeanor, though Nina soon found that he could joke and laugh with as much enjoyment as she herself could.</p>
               <p>By the time her old friend left her, Nina had become very well acquainted with her new protector, and he seemed to take the interest of a father in her. She parted from Mrs. Lyme with a few tears, which were soon wiped away, and gave her the assurance she asked, that she would keep her informed of all that happened to her.</p>
               <p>But the promise was given with many mental reservations; for Nina thought that much might occur which she would be unwilling to communicate to one so warmly interested in her as Mrs. Lyme was.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SEA VOYAGE, AND A SINGULAR MEETING.</head>
               <p>MR. MATSON decided to go to New Orleans by sea, and a few hours after Mrs. Lyme's departure, Nina found herself comfortably established on a magnificent steamer bound for that port.</p>
               <p>The Florida steamed out of the beautiful bay, girt by its<pb n="442-443" xml:id="VAC6338-00000214"/> flourishing cities and hamlets, and gained the wide ocean. By sunset they were out of sight of land, and for the first time in her life, Nina was afloat upon the briny deep, of which she had thought and dreamed so often.</p>
               <p>She did not suffer from sea-sickness, and as the weather was brilliantly clear, and the air not too piercing, she remained on deck the greater part of the day. Mr. Matson talked with her of his sons and daughters, of whom he had six, all pearls of price in the fond father's estimation.</p>
               <p>Day after day the same theme was renewed, and one afternoon he said to her:</p>
               <p>"Two of my boys are married, Miss Nina, and the third one is too young for you, or I believe that I should try to interfere with Mr. Hastings' arrangement by finding you a home of your own before you have been long in our beautiful land. I have taken a great fancy to you, my dear, for you remind me of a lady I know and admire very much."</p>
               <p>Nina laughed, and with a little pique at his last words, flattering as the first had been, replied:</p>
               <p>"It seems always my fortune to remind new friends of some one they have known. I would much rather be valued on my own account, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"So you are, for you are charming enough, and have sufficient individuality to ensure a peculiar place in the regards of those so fortunate as to know you. Besides, it is a compliment for me to tell you that you resemble Mrs. Marsden, for I think her a very lovely and superior woman."</p>
               <p>The name arrested Nina, and she asked:</p>
               <p>"Where does this lady live?"</p>
               <p>"In Norfolk; and if we run in there, as New Orleans steamers often do, I will take you to her house and introduce you. I think you will be much pleased with her."</p>
               <p>Nina was now listening with vivid interest. She eagerly said:</p>
               <p>"It is strange, but I have been told of the resemblance between Mrs. Marsden and myself before. I have heard an old friend of hers speak of her frequently. She and Mrs. Hawks were brought up together, and the latter retained a strong feeling of affection for her early friend as long as she lived."</p>
               <p>"So you knew Eunice Horton in her last days, as I knew her in her prime. I heard of her death while I was in New York, and I was told that she made a singular will, leaving the whole of her large fortune to a young girl she had picked up somewhere as a companion; but in a sudden fit of passion she revoked the bequest in a codicil, and gave her money to charities. Do you know if this is true?"</p>
               <p>Nina flushed deeply, but she carelessly replied:</p>
               <p>"I believe it is. I knew Mrs. Hawks but a short time, and she seemed to me a person of very capricious temper. How long is it since you met with her?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, ages ago, when she was a young lady, though never a very attractive one. Hawks married her for her money, I suppose; for, after the old man disinherited his younger daughter, she must have been a great match. It surprises me that Mr. Horton should have carried his resentment against Mrs. Lopez beyond the grave, for it seems that he left her child unprovided for, and Mrs. Hawks did little to remedy the injustice of which he was guilty."</p>
               <p>The conversation was taking a turn that was by no means pleasing to Nina, and she suddenly said:</p>
               <p>"What a lovely sunset. Sea and sky seem to blend in one mass of golden glory, and the air is perceptibly warmer as we approach the gulf stream. It is worth braving the storms of old ocean to see the sun sink away in his arms in such a blaze of lustre as that."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed beautiful; but there is a coppery tinge about that pavilion of clouds that heralds a storm, I fear. It will blow hard before morning."</p>
               <pb n="444-445" xml:id="VAC6338-00000215"/>
               <p>"Then I shall be able to prove what a good sailor I am. I have always desired to witness a storm at sea."</p>
               <p>The man at the wheel overheard her, and he said, with a slight laugh:</p>
               <p>"You will have to be shut up in the cabin, Miss, for it will be sure to blow great guns before midnight. I know the signs, and we seldom pass the capes at this season without some ugly weather."</p>
               <p>Almost as he spoke the wind came in light gusts, ruffling the surface of the water, and in ten minutes more it had increased to such an extent that Mr. Matson insisted on taking Nina down to the cabin. But this she resisted, and she remained on deck till darkness closed in, and nothing was visible but the phosphorescent gleam of the waves as they were lashed into fury by the increasing gale.</p>
               <p>When the stars were blotted from the sky by the gathering clouds, Nina consented to go below and join the other lady passengers, who were found huddled together in a frightened group, believing the steamer in imminent danger of shipwreck.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matson made efforts to reassure them, but with indifferent success, for the storm continued to increase in violence, and by midnight they seemed to be tossing at the mercy of the winds and waves.</p>
               <p>Prayers and cries for mercy were heard on every side; but through all the confusion Nina retained her calmness. She felt the conviction that her life was not to be cut short in this sudden manner, for she had something yet to do in the world; though it had been better for her and for those she was about to seek if the halls of ocean had received her in their depths that stormy night.</p>
               <p>The good ship bravely weathered the gale, and the following day she ran into Hampton Roads and steamed on to Norfolk to have a few necessary repairs made.</p>
               <p>Late in the evening Nina issued from her state-room, refreshed by the sleep she had enjoyed after the danger was past, and she found that the steamer had been anchored at the wharf several hours. Supper was served, and Mr. Matson came down to it, looking bright and animated. He said to her:</p>
               <p>"I have been on shore looking for Marsden, who is a distant cousin of mine; but he is not in town. I have sent a note to his wife, letting her know that I am coming to call on her this evening, accompanied by a young friend of mine. You will go, of course."</p>
               <p>"I have heard so much about this lady that I should be no woman if I were not desirous of seeing her. I will accompany you with the greatest pleasure," replied Nina, gayly. "Since Mrs. Marsden will not be allowed time to call on me, I must take the initiative myself, and, introduced by you, I shall feel that I am quite welcome."</p>
               <p>"You are a sensible girl, Miss Nina, and one after my own heart. As soon as supper is over, then, we will be off. I have already engaged a carriage to be at the landing in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"What a charming escort you are, Mr. Matson, in spite of your grey hairs, and grandchildren. I believe I would set my cap at you in place of your son, if Mrs. Matson would only be so obliging as to take her place among the angels."</p>
               <p>"And a fine dance such a will-o'-the-wisp as you are would lead a staid, elderly fellow like myself. No, thank you, Miss Nina; I admire you as I do some beautiful roses set around with thorns which would cruelly prick my hands if I attempted to gather them."</p>
               <p>"So I am actually refused by the first gentleman to whom I have ever ventured to propose," cried Nina, laughing gaily, and she ran off to prepare for her visit.</p>
               <pb n="446-447" xml:id="VAC6338-00000216"/>
               <p>"What a charming creature she is," thought the sober merchant. "I wonder how long that jealous wife of Hastings will tolerate her presence beneath her roof? Not long, I fancy; but then such a girl as that, will soon find some lucky fellow to give her a home of her own."</p>
               <p>Thus musing, he was unconscious of Nina's approach, till she spoke beside him:</p>
               <p>"I am quite ready now, Mr. Matson, and most impatient to see my double, for the resemblance between Mrs. Marsden and myself almost amounts to that, I suppose."</p>
               <p>"No it does not, and you may not see it at all. Your voice—your playful ways, and something in the cast of your features, reminds me of Anna when I first knew her, but there the likeness ends. Her hair and eyes are dark, and yours are light, but you will soon judge for yourself. There comes the carriage, and in twenty minutes we shall be at her door."</p>
               <p>Mr. Matson assisted her to the wharf, and placed her in the vehicle which, in a few moments was rapidly driven through Main street to Granby, and across the stone arch that spans the stream which intersects a portion of the town. After making several turns the carriage drew up in front of a handsome dwelling, with a row of Lombardy poplar trees in front.</p>
               <p>A small green yard enclosing by iron railings, was divided in the centre by a flight of stone steps that led to the door, on which was a lion's head of brass highly polished.</p>
               <p>Mr. Matson dismissed the carriage with orders to the driver to return in two hours, mounted the steps with Nina, and struck a loud peal on the old fashioned knocker.</p>
               <p>This was responded to by a black servant, who ushered them into a lighted parlor in which a fire of cannel coal was blazing brightly. The room was untenanted, but they had scarcely sat down when the door opening into an adjoining apartment was unclosed, and a slender, graceful looking woman, evidently in delicate health, entered.</p>
               <p>Her dress was very plain, but of rich material, and a small lace cap covered the hair which Nina noticed was beginning to be streaked with grey.</p>
               <p>She cordially extended her hand to Mr. Matson, and said:</p>
               <p>"You are welcome, as you always are, Cousin Ned, but I am sorry that Mr. Marsden is not here to see you. It seems an age since we met. I was young then, and now—well, you can see for yourself what changes time has made in me. This is your young friend, I suppose. I am very glad that you brought her with you."</p>
               <p>Nina was actually startled by the first sound of her voice, for its tones seemed an echo of her own. She arose as Mr. Matson replied:</p>
               <p>"Thank you for your welcome, Cousin Anna. Permit me to present to you Miss Nina Gordon. I have——"</p>
               <p>What he might have said further was cut short by a sudden gasping tremor which seized on Mrs. Marsden, and Mr. Matson hastened to support her, and place her on a sofa. She turned her face away from him, and remained several moments apparently in a half conscious state; but at length, with a deep inspiration, she raised herself, placed her hand upon her heart, and with a feeble attempt to smile, said:</p>
               <p>"I suffer from extreme oppression in my breast, and sudden fits of faintness seize me when I am least expecting them. My health is not good, as you may perceive from the change in my appearance. Pray excuse me, Miss Gordon, and make yourself as much at home as any friend of my cousin should in my house. Take off your bonnet and draw near the fire."</p>
               <pb n="448-449" xml:id="VAC6338-00000217"/>
               <p>Nina silently complied with both these requests, while Mrs. Marsden volubly went on to question Mr. Matson about his family, and the accident to the ship which had brought them to Norfolk. Nina critically surveyed her, and she scarcely felt complimented at being thought to resemble her. Mrs. Marsden looked worn and faded, and it was not difficult to see that her life was not a happy or contented one, though she appeared to be surrounded by all the externals of affluence.</p>
               <p>The room in which they sat was expensively furnished, but with the severe simplicity of an ascetic taste. There were no pictures on the walls; no ornaments on the mantel; no elegant trifles designed to wile away the time of visitors, were found upon the tables, and Nina remembered that Mrs. Hawks had said her early friend had married a man of very strict religious notions. So <emph>he</emph> ruled the wife he had taken from obscurity, she thought, and his taste dictated the furnishing of her house, and the adornment of her person, for the young visitor noted that not a jewel gleamed amid the rich attire of Mrs. Marsden, save a small gold pin that fastened her collar, in the centre of which a tiny brilliant sparkled.</p>
               <p>She did not even wear a wedding ring, and Nina smiled half contemptuously, at the state of vassalage into which her hostess had fallen, and wondered if any man breathing could reduce her to a similar condition. She thought not, and I quite agree with her. She was not made of yielding materials, and he who attempted to put a curb on her, would surely come to grief in the experiment.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marsden at length turned to Nina, though it was evidently with an effort; she seemed to feel that longer neglect of the stranger within her gates would be remarked by Mr. Matson, and after giving a strange, wavering glance at her face, she said:</p>
               <p>"You have had a narrow escape from shipwreck, Miss Gordon. The storm last night was a terrible one even on land, and I could not sleep for thinking of those who had 'gone down to the sea in ships.' But you look well, and bright, in spite of all you have gone through."</p>
               <p>"I was not much frightened, madam. I knew the vessel that bore me upon my way would not founder."</p>
               <p>"You must have great faith," murmured the lady.</p>
               <p>Nina laughed:</p>
               <p>"Yes—I have great faith in my destiny; that is all, for I do not pretend to be a saint."</p>
               <p>Some powerful emotion seemed to shake the frail frame of Mrs. Marsden, as she listened to these words; she became very pale, and again pressed her hand upon her heart. Her eyes seemed to be fascinated to the face of Nina, and she looked into the light, defiant orbs raised to hers with a pitiful questioning glance that would have been painful to a more sensitive person.</p>
               <p>But Nina read nothing of its meaning, and waited for her hostess to break the silence that had fallen upon them.</p>
               <p>In low, measured tones, Mrs. Marsden at length asked:</p>
               <p>"Does that destiny promise to be so brilliant, that even the storms of ocean shrank from quenching its brightness? Tell me, Miss Gordon, for you interest me."</p>
               <p>With some bitterness Nina replied:</p>
               <p>"I have youth, hope and strong will, Mrs. Marsden. They are all my dower, and I am now on my way to Mississippi to become a governess in the family of a wealthy man. You will scarcely consider that a very brilliant commencement in life, but the wheel of fortune may yet chance to bring me to the highest round of worldly prosperity. I intend to do my best to gain it, at all events."</p>
               <p>A faint flush came to the listener's cheek, and with some effort she asked:</p>
               <pb n="450-451" xml:id="VAC6338-00000218"/>
               <p>"Were you educated with such a prospect as that held out to you as the result of your studies?"</p>
               <p>Nina flushed in her turn, and rather haughtily replied:</p>
               <p>"No, madam. Until I had completed my education, I was led to believe from the money lavished on me that I was an heiress. <emph>Then</emph> I was notified that I must earn my own bread; I have been doing it for many months past, and I am quite satisfied with the prospect opening before me now."</p>
               <p>"And that prospect? What is it? To whom are you going?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Matson saw that Nina was annoyed by these queries, and he hastened to interpose, wondering that his cousin's wife should manifest so much interest in the affairs of so utter a stranger as Nina must be to her. He said:</p>
               <p>"I am taking Miss Gordon south to become the companion and instructress of William Hastings' daughter. You knew something of him in days o' lang syne, I believe, and——"</p>
               <p>His words were again cut short by another attack of faintness overpowering his hostess, and this time she lay so long white and limp that he began to think of summoning assistance. But Mrs. Marsden held his hand grasped tightly in her own, and when she regained the power of speech she faintly said:</p>
               <p>"Do not alarm my children by calling any one. I am not strong, and it takes very little to overcome me."</p>
               <p>"You are changed since I last saw you. What on earth has brought you to such a pass as this, Anna?"</p>
               <p>A weary smile flitted over her wan lips, and she replied:</p>
               <p>"The will of God, I suppose. For several years my health has been failing, and medical skill has not benefitted me. The first blow was the death of my children—four of them were snatched from me in a single week by a contagious gious fever, and only the youngest survive. How I lived through that fearful trial I scarcely yet understand."</p>
               <p>"Yes—I heard of that great affliction," said Mr. Matson, sympathetically; "but I felt that if any one could bear it with Christian fortitude, you and your good husband would."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Marsden bore it as he does everything, in stern and silent endurance. But to me—to <emph>me</emph> it came as a judgment! I know it—I know it!"</p>
               <p>The fervent passion with which the last words were uttered, startled Mr. Matson, and he hastened to say:</p>
               <p>"Don't talk so, Anna. You have always been a good woman, a model wife and mother; then why should you believe that a judgment has been sent on you? People lose their children every day without fancying such a thing."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you don't know—you don't know!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly recovering self-possession, Mrs. Marsden raised herself and wearily said:</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Miss Gordon, for referring to such mournful themes in the presence of one who can be expected to take but little interest in the affairs of a passing acquaintance. I will order in some refreshments, and with them will come the two darlings I have left to me. I should like you to see them, and Cousin Ned must be able to carry home a description of them."</p>
               <p>"By all means," said Mr. Matson. "I was just going to ask for the children."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marsden arose and left the room, and when the door closed on her, Matson turned to Nina and went on:</p>
               <p>"You will hardly believe that my cousin's wife was once a beautiful and captivating woman. But she is a perfect wreck now; her heart was wrapped up in her two eldest children, twin daughters of rare loveliness and promise. You see what their loss has brought her to, for I think she<pb n="452-453" xml:id="VAC6338-00000219"/> grieved over the boys far less than over them. Poor Anna! I scarcely think that my stern, ascetic kinsman was the right husband for her, though he has been very kind to her, in his hard way. I forgot to tell her that you knew her old friend, Eunice Horton, and I am almost afraid to refer to those times lest they may bring on another attack of faintness. There was something painful connected with the last days of her residence in Mr. Horton's family, for she has always been shy of talking of them."</p>
               <p>Nina drily replied:</p>
               <p>"I think it will be best to say nothing on the subject. I will also say to you that I do not wish to discuss Mrs. Hawks, for my acquaintance with her was the most painful episode in my short life."</p>
               <p>She did not explain further, and the entrance of Mrs. Marsden leading a child on each side, put an end to the communion between them.</p>
               <p>A girl of four and a boy six years of age came shyly forward to be petted and caressed by the strangers. A servant followed, bearing a silver waiter, on which were wine, fruit, cake and sweetmeats.</p>
               <p>Little Anna sat demurely on the lap of Mr. Matson, while Walter nestled to his mother's side, and the party, gathered around the table on which the refreshments were placed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Marsden spoke of her absent husband, became more animated and self-possessed, and Nina discerned something of the charm of manner to which Mr. Matson had alluded when describing her. She felt alternately attracted and repelled by her new acquaintance, she could not have explained why, and she felt tempted to refer to Mr. Hastings again, for she thought she possessed the clue to Mrs. Marsden's emotions when his name was mentioned. But when she looked upon the worn and suffering face on the shadowy form before her, an unwonted feeling of compassion filled Nina's heart, and she forbore.</p>
               <p>After being duly praised, and as much wine and cake given to them as their mother would allow, the children were kissed and sent to bed, and the conversation flowed on agreeably until the hour of ten. Then the visitors arose to leave; and after her bonnet and shawl were on, Mrs. Marsden approached Nina, and with her sweetest smile, said:</p>
               <p>"I have rarely seen a young person who interested me so deeply on so short an acquaintance as you do, Miss Gordon. Will you allow me to kiss you? and will you promise me that if you should ever need a friend, you will remember that I shall be glad to be of use to you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, thank you a thousand times!" exclaimed Nina, with animation. "I promise to call on you, madam, if I should meet with tribulation in place of success in the career before me. But I will anticipate nothing but the last."</p>
               <p>She held up her rosy lips to be kissed by the pale woman, who clasped her hand nervously in both her own.</p>
               <p>The carriage was in waiting, and at last the adieus were ended, and the visitors safely seated in it. In half an hour, Nina was again in her state-room, and before she awoke on the following morning the ship was on the sea again, plowing her way toward the Florida coast.</p>
               <p>They made their way safely around the peninsular, touched at Havana, where they remained long enough to afford Nina a pleasant glimpse of tropical life, and then steamed as rapidly as possible toward New Orleans.</p>
               <p>Everything she saw was new and delightful to the young traveller; she was even interested in the flat and sedgy banks of the lower Mississippi; and when the green and cultivated low lands of Louisiana began to loom upon her, she was charmed with the contrast they afforded to the<pb n="454-455" xml:id="VAC6338-00000220"/> dreary scene through which she had gained the paradise of bloom and flowers so striking to a northern eye at that season of the year.</p>
               <p>The steamer approached New Orleans on the morning of a brilliant day, and the passengers gathered on the deck to watch the busy, ever-changing crowd upon the levee, engaged in that Babel of commercial activity which reigns without intermission from November till June in the Crescent City.</p>
               <p>The river was unusally high for the season of the year, and the steamer floated almost on a level with the high embankment which protects the city from inundation—thus affording to the strangers on board, the singular spectacle of streets and houses standing on a level below them, which inclines slightly but perceptibly toward the low lands in the rear of the town.</p>
               <p>The motley crowd gathered from nearly every nation under the sun—the confusion of tongues mingled with the rattling of carriages and drays—formed a scene as unique as it was confusing to Nina; and she was glad to leave the bustle of the levee, and take possession of a pleasant room at the St. Charles.</p>
               <p>Nina remained long enough in New Orleans to visit every object of interest in and around the city, and then embarked again on a fine Southern packet for Natchez. The beautiful, garden-like country lying between the two places, filled her with delight and astonishment, at the evidences of industry and prosperity that met her sight on every side.</p>
               <p>We will leave her on her way to the scene of her future exploits, and return to Fenton, who had preceded her to Mississippi by but a few weeks.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">FENTON RETURNS TO HIS SOUTHERN HOME.</head>
               <p>GODFREY FENTON drew near his home in a most wretched and uncertain state of mind. The farther he was borne from Inez, the more earnest grew the longing to return to her; the deeper grew the dread that he would find it impossible to do so.</p>
               <p>When the steamer came in sight of the high bluff on which Natchez is built, he felt as if it loomed before him as the barrier to every hope in life. On that soil, he should find the solution of his destiny, and he shrank from the necessity which brought him there a petitioner to his haughty mother for what he felt almost assured would never be granted.</p>
               <p>The nearer he drew to her, the more resistless did her power over him seem; and, when the steamer rounded to before the small cluster of business houses known as Natchez under the hill, Fenton felt as if he was already beneath the sway of that imperious will which had moulded him to what he was.</p>
               <p>The day was beautifully clear, but the cloudless sky, with its transparent depths of ether—the soft air had no charm for his restless heart. He felt the want of exercise, and, leaving his baggage to be sent up to the hotel, he ascended on foot the wooden walk built on one side for the accommodation of pedestrians.</p>
               <p>Crossing he wide space on a level with the town, Fenton drew near Main street in a listless and weary way, far different from his usual light and elastic manner of bearing himself. Approaching him at full speed was an elegant open carriage, drawn by a pair of bays that were the pride<pb n="456-457" xml:id="VAC6338-00000221"/> of their owner; and within sat two ladies wearing Paris bonnets and cashmere shawls.</p>
               <p>The elder of these was a graceful but faded-looking brunette, though she wore a slight tinge of rouge upon her cheeks. There was an air of languid affectation about her that might have been attractive to the opposite sex in her youth, but now it seemed insipid and unsuited to her years or the dignity of her position as the mother of the tall, well-grown, young lady at her side.</p>
               <p>The face of the girl was very fair, and almost colorless, until some thought or emotion sent the blood in a flickering glow to her pearly cheeks, which flushed, and faded alternately in a most unusual and charming manner.</p>
               <p>The clear oval of her face was framed by long curls of golden chestnut; her eyes were of that deep violet blue so rarely seen, and so exquisite in shading and expression; her mouth was perfect, and the sweet and ingenuous soul that breathed from this charming face was even more attractive than the statuesque beauty of her face and person.</p>
               <p>Her shawl had fallen from one shoulder, revealing a form more perfectly developed than might have been expected from the extreme youthfulness of her face. Like most natives of a Southern clime, this daughter of the sun had matured rapidly, and at the age of sixteen was a woman in appearance, though still in heart a child.</p>
               <p>Her eyes fell on Fenton, and she exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Mamma, there is Godfrey! Stop the horses, Tom, I must speak to Mr. Fenton."</p>
               <p>Obedient to the command, the black driver checked the spirited steeds, and drew up to the curb-stone near which Fenton had paused on seeing a white handkerchief waved to him from an approaching carriage. The young girl leaned forward, and impulsively extended her hand to him, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Godfrey? Your mother will be so glad to see you again, for she has been pining for your presence more than I can tell you."</p>
               <p>Fenton felt something like a galvanic shock as he heard her voice, and looked into her smiling, blushing face. He hastily said:</p>
               <p>"Is it possible! Can two years have wrought such a change, and in place of the child I left in short dresses, do I find a young lady? or rather a young queen of beauty and fascination. I declare, Opal, I should scarcely have known you again had I met you anywhere else, for you have marvellously improved."</p>
               <p>"Thank you—but you were always a terrible flatterer. Here is mamma with me."</p>
               <p>She drew back to allow the elder lady to address him, and she languidly extended her hand as she said:</p>
               <p>"I am very glad to see you at home again, Godfrey. Mr. Hastings will be delighted to welcome you back, for he has been very much put out by your long stay at the North. You know what an immense favorite you always were with him; in fact, nobody can fill your place."</p>
               <p>Fenton shook hands with her, flushed slightly, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I am much obliged to him, I am sure, Mrs. Hastings, for his goodness. I shall come over to Silvermere as soon as possible after seeing my mother, and I know that I shall make up for lost time now that I see what an attraction your house contains."</p>
               <p>He glanced significantly at Opal, who was fixedly regarding him, and he was surprised and amused to see her rosy lips form themselves into a decided <hi rend="i"/>mou at this speech. That was one of her childish tricks which he thought she would have laid aside with her short frocks and pantalettes, but there was something piquant in her thus renewing the old familiarity in the first moment of meeting.</p>
               <pb n="458-459" xml:id="VAC6338-00000222"/>
               <p>The horses were impatiently pawing the earth, irritated at the restraint put upon them, and Mrs. Hastings said in her indolent way:</p>
               <p>"We shall look for you at Silvermere at the earliest possible moment, Godfrey. Your mother has been quite ill, but she is about again, and she will be able to spare you. If you will excuse us from parting in so abrupt a manner from so old a friend, I will order the driver to go on. I am a little afraid of those horses, for they are a new purchase of ours."</p>
               <p>"And a splendid turnout they are," replied Fenton, drawing back and touching his hat. "Thanks for your invitation, Mrs. Hastings; I shall be sure to make my appearance in your house as soon as my lady mother will permit me to leave her side. <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Au revoir.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>The carriage dashed on its way, and Fenton stood looking after it a few moments in a state of pleasant bewilderment. Opal Hastings, in the freshness of her young beauty, had dazzled him for the moment, and he thought:</p>
               <p>"It would not be a bad thing after all, to claim such a sweet creature as that as my own, with a dower a princess might envy. If my mother proves inexorable, I suppose that I must submit to my fate with the best grace possible. But good Heavens! of what baseness am I dreaming? Inez—Inez, you alone are to me the embodiment of all that is charming and adorable in woman. This fair child can only attract me for a moment, but you hold me bound to you by bonds stronger than any she can ever forge."</p>
               <p>He hurried forward till he reached the principal hotel, where he was greeted by many familiar voices with such welcome as he was glad to meet in the haunts of his boyhood and youth.</p>
               <p>A tall, fair young man, who had been one of his classmates at college, said to him:</p>
               <p>"I am delighted to see you back at last, Godfrey. You must dine with me here, and I will drive you out home in my cab. Your mother's place lies in my way, you know, and we can have a good talk on the road."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Wallis. I will accept both invitations, though I think it likely I shall find some one from the plantation here, as my mother is expecting me."</p>
               <p>"I saw Mrs. Markland's carriage-driver in town this morning, and I think it likely he is about now. He can look after your luggage, and save you any further trouble about it. Ah, here he comes now."</p>
               <p>An elderly negro made his way through the throng of young men that had gathered around the new-comer, and with beaming face greeted his young master.</p>
               <p>"Thank the Lord that you's come at last, Marse Godfrey. Missus has been lookin' for you ever so long, an' frettin bekase you was so long comin'."</p>
               <p>Fenton shook hands with him, and spoke a few cordial words to the sable retainer of his family, and then informed him of the arrangements he had just made. The man replied:</p>
               <p>"I've brung in de fine hoss dat Mistus has bought for you, Marse Godfrey, but dat don't made no difference. Little Mose is wid me, an' he can ride him out agin, I reckon."</p>
               <p>"Very well; arrange it the best way you can."</p>
               <p>And the negro took his directions about his luggage and moved away.</p>
               <p>The dinner bell was ringing, and the two young men went in together to the table. Wine and cigars followed the repast, and the sun was declining in the West when they took their places in the stylish looking cabriolet of Wallis.</p>
               <p>A negro lad in livery perched himself behind, and they drove through the town, taking several turns before they<pb n="460-461" xml:id="VAC6338-00000223"/> gained the Woodville road, which winds through the beautiful undulating country that lies on Second creek.</p>
               <p>That region is considered the garden spot of Mississippi. Beautiful homes lay secluded among forest trees, occasionally affording glimpses of white walls and long piazzas through the dense foliage. The road in many places was bordered by hedges of the Chickasaw rose, so luxuriant in growth as to cover many yards of ground. The magnolia grandiflora raised its stately shafts amid the other trees as proudly as the king of the forest should, and the deep green of its polished leaves contrasted with the gorgeous autumn foliage, which, in that sunny clime, had not yet fallen.</p>
               <p>After exhausting other topics of interest, Wallis said, with a gay laugh:</p>
               <p>"I saw you speaking to Mrs. Hastings and her daughter. Isn't Opal a divine creature? I only wish I was in your place, old fellow, for we are given to understand that making love to her is tabooed. You are to be the lucky man, report says, though if I chose to tell tales on you about that fascinating music teacher in New Haven, I might make mischief, eh?"</p>
               <p>Fenton was annoyed at this speech, and he flushed slightly as he replied:</p>
               <p>"I could easily put that all straight. Miss Gordon was nothing to me beyond a pretty and piquant girl, with whom it was pleasant to flirt. Opal has improved wonderfully; she has developed into a most charming young lady; but I should be sorry to have her debarred from the privilege of having other admirers on account of such pretensions as I may have. There has long been a family understanding that we are to marry each other, but neither she nor I have yet ratified it. In all probability it will come to nothing."</p>
               <p>Willis turned his attention from his spirited steed a moment to survey the face of the speaker.</p>
               <p>"By Jove!" he cried, "that is the coolest speech I have heard for some time, considering that the young lady in question is a beauty and an heiress. What will <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la belle mère</foreign> say to such indifference on your part? She'll be sure to 'smell a mice,' for she has already heard something of that little flirtation of yours, to which you seem now to attach no importance."</p>
               <p>"There is no seeming about it. Nina Gordon is no more to me than any other woman, and it is to her you refer, I presume."</p>
               <p>"Well—yes—for I thought you were in earnest there. You are a regular heart-breaker, Fenton, for I have known you to make more than one romantic young lady believe that you only lived in her smiles. It will be lucky for the sex when you really become a Benedict; for if Opal really takes after her mother, she will not let <emph>you</emph> be sunning yourself in the eyes of other beauties when you are her lawful property. Mrs. Hastings is as jealous as a Turk, and as imperious, too, I fancy."</p>
               <p>"A pleasant prospect to look forward to, truly," replied Fenton, with a constrained laugh. "But if I should marry Mrs. Hastings' daughter, of which there is little probability at present, she must forget the lessons learned from her mother's example, for I do not intend to be ruled by my wife. I would drown or shoot myself sooner than submit to be badgered as Mr. Hastings is. But as his wife had all the money, I suppose he can't help himself."</p>
               <p>"No—that is where the shoe pinches. But he's a fine old fellow in spite of his submission to the moneyed power. I don't know a more hospitable or agreeable host than your future papa-in-law; for of course you'll fall in love with Opal as every body does, and end by making your mother's heart glad, by accepting the bride so long intended for you."</p>
               <pb n="462-463" xml:id="VAC6338-00000224"/>
               <p>"We will talk no more on that subject, if you please, Wallis. Miss Hastings is yet a school girl, and until she is eighteen, there will be no question of marriage. I did not come hither to make love to Opal, I assure you, but only to visit my mother who wrote me that she was ill."</p>
               <p>"Yes; Mrs. Markland has been much indisposed, but she has recovered. I saw her out a few days ago, and she was looking about as usual. Here we are at the turn off to Magnolia. I will drive down to the gate and leave you there, as I will not intrude on the first meeting between yourself and your mother."</p>
               <p>"Don't take that trouble, my dear fellow. Put me down here; I prefer walking to the house. Come over to-morrow, and remember that I shall always be glad to see you."</p>
               <p>"Of course I shall come over, for that pretty sister of yours is budding into a most fascinating little gipsy. She will almost rival the fair Opal one of these days."</p>
               <p>"I shall not allow you to turn Dora's head with flatteries; mind that, Wallis, for she is scarcely fourteen yet."</p>
               <p>"As if a pretty girl with a magnificent dower isn't bound to have her head turned? But I promise to be discreet."</p>
               <p>He drew up at the entrance to a long avenue, hemmed in by high hedges, on each side of which lay fields still white with cotton bolls.</p>
               <p>Bidding Wallis adieu, Fenton strode forward, at first rapidly, but he soon slackened his pace, and moved leisurely toward a belt of woodland, in the centre of which his home stood. Passing beneath the shadows of the magnolia-trees, from which the place derived its name, he came to a carefully-trimmed hedge of wild peach, which inclosed a yard laid off in angles, crescents, and hearts, set out with every variety of flowering plant that would flourish beneath that genial sky.</p>
               <p>Many late roses and chrysanthemums were still in bloom, and every portion of the parterre was in the neatest order. No dead leaves were permitted to litter the winding walks, and the birds made their nests undisturbed amid the taller shrubs.</p>
               <p>The dwelling was a long, old-fashioned plantation-house, with a piazza extending its whole length, the roof of which was supported on heavy Doric columns. A flight of wooden steps painted to imitate stone, led up to it, on each side of which stood a brick column sustaining a stone vase—in one of which an orange-tree, and in the other an oleander, was growing.</p>
               <p>As Fenton approached the house, a magnificent Newfoundland dog, as black as jet, sprang from some concealed lair, with a deep-mouthed bark, which was speedily turned into a joyful whine of recognition, as he frisked and curvetted around the young man, making efforts to place his paws upon his shoulders.</p>
               <p>This Fenton would not permit, and his cry of "Down, Carlo, down!" brought two young girls upon the gallery—one a dark-eyed, slender creature, who had already attained her full height, though but fourteen years of age; and the other two years younger, with the blonde complexion of her half-brother—for these were Dora and Jenny Markland, the daughters of his mother's second marriage.</p>
               <p>They both sprang impulsively to meet him, the elder one crying out:</p>
               <p>"Mamma—mamma, here is Godfrey come at last."</p>
               <p>The next moment, Dora was in his arms, kissing and clinging to him on one side, while Jenny did the same thing on the other.</p>
               <p>He laughingly cried:</p>
               <p>"Don't strangle me at once, pets. Leave me some breath with which to greet my mother."</p>
               <pb n="464-465" xml:id="VAC6338-00000225"/>
               <p>"Oh yes—mamma has been so anxious about you," said Dora, removing her arm from his neck, and clinging to his hand. "Come in at once, Godfrey; she is in her room, and did not hear me call, or she would have been on the gallery by this time. Dear brother, I am so glad to have you back home again, and it is so long since you went away."</p>
               <p>He smiled down on them both most lovingly, as he replied:</p>
               <p>"It is worth while to go away for a time, to meet such a welcome as this when I return. You have both grown wonderfully; you, Dora, are almost a woman now, and my pretty Jenny is a head taller than when I saw her last."</p>
               <p>"Mamma says I shall be as tall, and grand-looking for a woman as you are for a man, brother," said the little one, raising herself on tip-toe, for it was the great ambition of her life to grow to be as tall a woman as the mother who was her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau ideal</foreign> of elegance and grace.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you will soon outstrip Dora here; but she can console herself by remembering that the most precious things are put up in small parcels."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, brother; I am glad that somebody appreciates my slight figure and gipsy-looking face. I am my father's child, and mamma naturally thinks the two who resemble herself more attractive than I am."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that, pet; but you remember what <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chère mère</foreign> says to Franziska, that 'each one has her own little charm.' You are permitted to read Miss Bremer's books, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—and I have read the Neighbors. I shall remember your quotation, brother, and make the most of such little charm as may be found in me."</p>
               <p>By this time they had crossed the wide gallery, and entered a spacious hall furnished with sofas and chairs, and hung with pictures handsomely framed. At the farthest end, a door opened on a portico, beyond which lay a spacious lawn, shaded by lofty trees; through a long vista that opened in the distance, glimpses of white cottages of the negro quarters were obtained.</p>
               <p>Everything about the place was in the most accurate order, and Fenton smiled as he thought that his mother was a martinet in more ways than one.</p>
               <p>A door on the side of the hall suddenly opened, and a lady looked out of it on the chattering trio. The next moment, Fenton had released himself from his sisters, and clasped his mother in his arms.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland received the embrace with the dignified composure that was her distinguishing characteristic, for she considered it low-bred and in bad taste to exhibit such emotion as she really felt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE STRONGER WILL ASSERTS ITSELF.</head>
               <p>MRS. MARKLAND was still a very handsome woman in spite of her forty-five years; tall and commanding in person, with features cast in the same mould as those of her son; from her also had Fenton inherited his abundant hair, and that of his mother was still as bright and soft as in her youth. The color of the eyes was the same in both, though those of the young man were more animated and less expressive of pride than those of his mother.</p>
               <p>She wore a heavy steel-gray silk, trimmed with black, with a filmy-lace collar fastened with a pin, in which was set the miniature of her last husband set around with pearls. She had made her toilette in the expectation that her son would arrive before the day was over, and had taken as much pains<pb n="466-467" xml:id="VAC6338-00000226"/> to impress him with her stately beauty as though he had been a stranger.</p>
               <p>As Fenton looked into her haughty face and saw the play of her reticent lips, he felt the old spell coming back upon him, and he knew beforehand that he should be moulded by his tenacious mother to any course she willed him to take. She quietly said:</p>
               <p>"I am most happy to welcome you to my house again, my son, but I have the sad mortification of fearing that you come to it unwillingly; that the news of my recent illness alone recalled you to the society of your mother and sisters. But that conviction shall make no difference in my treatment of you, for you are not less the hope of my heart and the pride of my life than you were in your boyhood, Godfrey. You are handsomer than ever, though you are looking jaded and unhappy."</p>
               <p>"Dear mother, don't reproach me with the last, in the first moment of meeting. I have withheld nothing from you; my heart has been laid open to your inspection before I came hither, and I do hope that you will exercise some forbearance toward me. I am glad to be at home again, though I confess that I most unwillingly obeyed the summons that tore me from the one who is dearest to me in life."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Dearest!</emph> Yes, I suppose the fondest mother must yield her claim to the warmest place in the heart of her son, even when he woos a wife without her permission. But not another word of this before the children; when we are alone we can fully discuss the last insane letter you sent me, for I believe that nothing short of madness could have dictated it."</p>
               <p>Fenton yielded passively to her imperious command, as he always did when he was under the magnetic influence of her presence. They sat down together in her luxuriously furnished nished chamber, and talked over the incidents of his journey, while the two girls listened with absorbing interest, both fully impressed with the conviction that their brother was the most elegant and delightful man the world could boast of. They had been brought up to make a sort of household divinity of their mother's eldest-born; and the affectionate petting he lavished on them had won the warmest affection of their young hearts.</p>
               <p>As the last rays of the evening sunshine were fading from the landscape, Fenton took up his hat and, rising, said:</p>
               <p>"I must go out before supper and visit the quarters; the negroes will expect to see me before I retire, and this is the hour for them to return from the field."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it will be best for you to go now, for when supper is over, I have much to say to you that is important to your future welfare," said Mrs. Markland significantly.</p>
               <p>Fenton colored, bit his lip, and, followed by his sisters, left the room.</p>
               <p>"We will go with you to see the darkies gather around you and make much of you, brother," said Dora, taking up her straw hat as she passed through the hall. Jenny tied a nubia over her head, and the three went out together.</p>
               <p>They were detained in the yard by a group of house-servants, who had impatiently awaited Fenton's appearance, for not one of them had presumed to intrude on the interview between the mother and son. To each one he spoke some pleasant word of greeting, and his gay and cheerful ways made him very popular among those simple-hearted people, who prize a courteous manner to themselves above every thing else.</p>
               <p>"God bless him! Marse Godfrey is the <emph>real</emph> gentleman!" was heard from more than one, as he moved on his way to the quarters.</p>
               <p>A quarter of a mile distant was a double row of frame<pb n="468-469" xml:id="VAC6338-00000227"/> cottages shaded by forest trees, with a wide street between them and small gardens for vegetables in the rear. Each one had its poultry house, and many of them a fig-tree.</p>
               <p>The "people" were trooping in, bearing large baskets filled with cotton, to be weighed by the overseer, who was standing under a shed which projected from the gin-house. A pair of large scales were near him; and, in one hand he held a slate, on which the number of pounds picked by each hand that day was jotted down opposite the name of the laborer.</p>
               <p>The overseer nodded to Fenton, and went on with his employment, while the negroes crowded around him, and, as Dora had said, made much of him by calling down blessings on his handsome face, and predicting all manner of good luck for him in the future. He had known them all from boyhood, and not one of them could recall a hard or unkind act of his in which they were concerned; therefore they all loved him; and when "Missis" settled him on a place of his own, as it was understood she intended to do when he married, each one vaguely hoped that he or she would chance to fall to Marse Godfrey, for no division of the slaves had yet been made, and they were ignorant to whom they were to fall when that was done.</p>
               <p>Fenton was really glad to meet his sable friends again, and he returned to the house in better spirits and fortified for the formidable interview that he knew awaited him.</p>
               <p>He found his mother in the dining-room with a brilliant array of china and silver before her, for she had set forth the best her house contained in honor of her son's arrival. The supper was delicate and deliciously cooked, and Fenton saw that his favorite dishes had not been forgotten. But he had little appetite in spite of the drive he had taken; and, after drinking a cup of tea and eating a few rice cakes, he amused himself with teazing his sisters till the meal was over.</p>
               <p>When they arose from the table, Mrs. Markland led the way to the library, whither they were followed by Dora and Jenny. Fenton tried to put off the evil hour by detaining them to answer questions concerning their studies; and he learned that they attended a private school on the adjoining plantation, where an accomplished governess was employed. He listened with pretended interest to many anecdotes about Miss King's management of her pupils; but at length Mrs. Markland put an end to this by saying:</p>
               <p>"It is eight o'clock, children; go to your room and prepare your lessons for to-morrow. I wish to talk with your brother in private, but on Saturday you shall have him all to yourselves."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mamma," pouted Jenny, "I thought when Godfrey came that we were to have a holiday. We have but one more day to go to school this week, and I think you might let us off from lessons to-night!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland coldly replied:</p>
               <p>"You know that I never excuse you for any cause but illness. Go now, my dears, and attend to your duties. They are things that must not be neglected when it is possible to perform them. You would gain nothing by doing so now, for your brother will not be at home tomorrow. I have accepted an invitation for him to dine at Silvermere, and you know it is against my rules to permit you to go to dinner parties."</p>
               <p>The tone of her voice admitted of no remonstrance, and the reluctant children arose, kissed their mother as was their habit on retiring, caressed their brother tenderly, and retired, attended by a black girl who had been rung for to take charge of them.</p>
               <p>The door closed on them, and Fenton hastened to say something that should for a few moments defer the attack he knew his mother was meditating.</p>
               <pb n="470-471" xml:id="VAC6338-00000228"/>
               <p>"Dora is growing into a lovely woman, mother. You will soon have a daughter to present to society as a belle."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is pretty, but too small and dark to be brilliant. Jenny will eclipse her, and I am glad of the difference in their ages, as it will give the elder one a chance to settle in life before the younger is brought forward."</p>
               <p>"I hardly agree with you. Dark women are more to my taste than fair ones, and I think Dora a charming brunette."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear that your taste inclines that way," replied Mrs. Markland, drily. "I wonder, too, that it should, considering that the girl you are bound to make your wife is as fair as a lily, and, what is better, as pure and sweet as one, too."</p>
               <p>The battle had begun in earnest now he knew, and Fenton would not show the white feather in the first onslaught. He steadily replied:</p>
               <p>"I do not consider myself bound by a promise I never made. I will not affect to misunderstand you, mother; but I thought that by this time you understood how impossible it is for me to gratify the contract you and Mr. Hastings made for Opal and myself. She cares nothing for me, and you know that I love another with all the strength of my heart."</p>
               <p>"I have heard such men as you talk in the same way before, Godfrey; yet they ultimately came to their sober senses, and did what their interests required. <emph>Yours</emph> are bound up with this marriage, and I will not listen to anything that militates against it."</p>
               <p>Her tone was cold and imperative, and her eyes were defiant and masterful. Mrs. Markland felt sure that she was mistress of the field, and she fully intended to drive the rebel to capitulate on her own terms.</p>
               <p>Fenton passionately cried out:</p>
               <p>"Mother, mother, do not say that, for I should be a wretch—a base and dishonored man—if I could ask Opal Hastings to be my wife when my whole heart is devoted to another. I cannot—I dare not do it."</p>
               <p>His mother disdainfully asked:</p>
               <p>"And that other? Who is she?—what is she, that you should presume to ask me to receive her as my daughter in place of the charming girl I have always intended you to marry. Has she wealth with which to endow you? for I assure you that you will get nothing from me, absolutely <emph>nothing,</emph> if you persist in this folly."</p>
               <p>"She has beauty, youth, loveliness of heart and mind, but, alas! her hopes of fortune are blasted. Oh, mother, Inez Lopez is everything to me! I desire her for my own above every other earthly gift. I never thought to love any one as I love her, and without her companionship the fair promise of my life will be blighted. Recall your cruel words, for I cannot bear them. I cannot give Inez up—I cannot—I cannot—and, besides, I am bound in honor to her."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland was unmoved by this passionate outbreak. She coldly replied:</p>
               <p>"Your sense of honor must be very peculiar. What right had you, in your position, to entangle yourself with this young lady? Did you not fully understand that you were not free to ask her to become your wife? Listen to me, Godfrey. My heart has for years been set on this match between you and Opal. I love her almost as if she were my own daughter, and when you have been thrown with her, you must soon feel the witchery she exercises over all who approach her. You must break with Miss Lopez; lay the blame on me if you will, and she cannot ask you to ruin your prospects by disobeying the mother on whom you are dependent. I wish you to understand fully that I will do nothing for you if you thwart me in this. I will withdraw<pb n="472-473" xml:id="VAC6338-00000229"/> draw your allowance, and leave you to fight your own battle with the world, as you best can. I shall lose my son; but he will lose all that he might have claimed, had he shown the deference to my wishes that I consider my due."</p>
               <p>Fenton arose and paced the floor in uncontrollable excitement. He at length paused, turned his pallid face toward her, and cried in tones of anguish:</p>
               <p>"You will drive me wild, Madam. I came to you in the hope that you would hear what I had to say in a different spirit; but you goad me beyond endurance; you threaten in place of consoling me, when, God knows! I need it so much. If you knew, if you could be made to understand what my betrothed is to me, you would shrink from asking me to give her up. I shall go to ruin; I may do something dreadful in my desperation if you treat me thus."</p>
               <p>In a more gentle tone, Mrs. Markland replied:</p>
               <p>"It is to save you from ruin that I am firm, my son. Do you suppose that I would wound you by using such threats if I did not clearly see that you are ready to rush into a position for which you are entirely unfitted? What could you do toward maintaining a wife? You have talent, it is true; but it has been directed in no channel that could secure independence through your own exertions. You have expensive tastes, a fastidious shrinking from trade, or indeed from labor of any kind. Then what prospect would you have before you in taking a dowerless bride to your bosom? It will never do, Godfrey. Miss Lopez may be an angel; I am willing to concede every perfection to her; but she is no fitting mate for you. If I could be wrought on to consent to your union with her, in five years from its date you would both have cause to wish that you had never seen each other."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe it! Inez would be the blessing of my life; she would make me a noble and true man, capable of filling the position every man should, as the provider of his family and the head of his house."</p>
               <p>"If she can accomplish <emph>that,</emph> you may try the experiment if you elect to do so. But if you do, remember that you are never to look to me for anything. I will otherwise dispose of what I have hoarded for you; I will throw you utterly on your own resources, and try and forget the ingrate who has returned all my care, all my fondness, by disappointing the wish that lies nearest my heart."</p>
               <p>She leaned back on her seat, pale and defiant, and Fenton bitterly said:</p>
               <p>"I would to God that I had a trade, profession, anything, to enable me to make my own way in life. I could work for Inez; I should be happy in doing so if I only knew how. But the accursed idleness in which I have been reared places me at your mercy, and enables you to grind me to the dust. When you see the result of what you are now doing, you may learn to think that it had been better to leave me to find my happiness in my own way."</p>
               <p>His mother hearkened to the last words with a feeling of triumph, for they indicated that the fortress was about to strike its colors. She understood that he dared not face the future with no hand to sustain, no reserve to fall back on. After a few moments' reflection, she quietly said:</p>
               <p>"I am only doing my duty by you, Godfrey. I must save you from yourself, for you are not now in a state to judge correctly of what will be best for your future welfare. Insane as you seem to be about this young girl, I believe that she is not the only one with whom you have thought yourself violently enamored since you went North. John Wallis told me of a flirtation with a music teacher in New Haven, but of course I knew you too well to suppose that you could be in earnest with <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>With some heat Fenton replied:</p>
               <pb n="474-475" xml:id="VAC6338-00000230"/>
               <p>"Wallis had little to do to tell you of such a thing as that, ma'am. There was nothing in it. Miss Gordon sang well—she was pretty and gay, and—and she reminded me of Opal. I paid her more attention than I should have done, perhaps, but I was never seriously in love with her."</p>
               <p>"Ah! then the attraction was her resemblance to Opal. That proves that you cared something for her in the days before this last madness attacked you. Godfrey, I know you better than you do yourself. You are a general admirer of women, and you could no more be constant to one than your father could before you. <emph>He</emph> flirted with every pretty girl that fell in his way even after he was a married man; but he was kind and generous to me, as you will be to Opal when she is your wife; and she, like me, will learn to tolerate this fault in your nature."</p>
               <p>By this time Fenton's excitement had nearly worn itself out, and he sat down moody, but no longer defiant. He felt that he was conquered, but he would utter no word to assure his antagonist of the victory she had won.</p>
               <p>To marry Inez without the consent of Mrs. Markland was, to him, impossible; and every line of her face, every inflexion of her voice assured him that she was as firm as adamant as to the course he must pursue if he would preserve her favor.</p>
               <p>After a long pause, which his mother would not break, Fenton said:</p>
               <p>"This discussion can do no good. We only annoy and irritate each other without any result. I will consider what you have said, and I promise to take no decisive step without informing you beforehand. That is all I can do. I must review my own position and make up my mind to—to—what shall be my future course."</p>
               <p>"Very well—that will be best. You know me well enough to comprehend that I never recede from what I have once said. I will not thrust Opal upon you; that will not be necessary. You must inevitably see a great deal of her, and I do not despair of seeing you as much charmed with her as you profess to be with your latest inamorata. You have not come home a day too soon for your own interests, for Guy has been devoting himself to her of late in a way that greatly displeased me. I spoke with him on the subject, and he took such offence at my words that he has left my house and has been staying with his sister for the last month, only visiting the plantation to see that the overseer is attending properly to his duties. He had the cool impertinence to tell me that you had found metal more attractive than your promised bride, and to say that you would bring me a gipsy daughter-in-law, with such a dower as would reconcile me to the match. From what you lately said, it seems that Miss Lopez has lost her fortune, but I assure you, if she were in possession of a million, my opposition to the match would be the same. I have long ago settled it that you are to marry Opal, and with my consent no other shall ever become your wife. Think over what I have said, and make up your mind, as I know you will, to act in this matter as every interest of your life requires you to do. Only give Opal a fair chance to win your heart, and I know she must succeed. Good night, my son; do not bear malice toward me because I am firm in withholding you from the gulf of poverty and obscurity into which you are so ready to plunge. No woman is worth the sacrifice of a man's prospects, however lovely and fascinating she may be."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland held out her hand, and Fenton felt constrained to take it in his own. She came nearer to him, bent forward, kissed him on the forehead, and said:</p>
               <p>"Are you so angry with me that you refuse to give me your usual good-night salute? I love you, Godfrey, better<pb n="476-477" xml:id="VAC6338-00000231"/> than any living creature, and I only act thus for your good. Remember that, and do nothing that will force me to tear you from my heart. In the event of your union with that girl, I would surely do it, even if my life were sacrificed in the struggle to cast you off."</p>
               <p>Her voice faltered slightly as she uttered the last words, and she hastily left the room.</p>
               <p>Fenton paced the floor many hours in a state of mind bordering on distraction; but view his position as he would he could see no avenue of success to what he had most deeply at heart. His mother had clearly made up her mind that he should not follow the bent of his own inclinations, and alas! he felt that he did not possess the firmness to sustain himself against her strong will.</p>
               <p>More than once he found himself recalling the sweet face that had smiled on him that day, with the feeling that Opal Hastings was not a girl to be lightly refused by any man, much less by him who had been considered as her betrothed from childhood.</p>
               <p>He finally sought his pillow with the reckless feeling that events might take their course, and Fate lead him whither it would. He had made his struggle and signally failed, so he was not responsible for the result.</p>
               <p>But he was very wretched—so wretched that he deserved pity even if he was so weak as to be unable to risk the loss of his mother's favor by following the dictates of his own heart.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">A DAY AT SILVERMERE—THE FALL OF A THUNDER-BOLT.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning Mrs. Markland met her son as kindly and serenely as if all memory of the conflict of the preceding night had passed from her mind. She knew that she held in her own hand the rein that could most effectually curb his rebellious impulses, and she had too much tact to widen the breach between them by any show of coldness.</p>
               <p>She was gentle and affectionate in her demeanor, and tried to make him feel that as long as he was her obedient son, she would be to him the same affectionate mother she had shewn herself from his infancy. She had said all she intended to say on the subject of Inez Lopez, and she was willing to leave the rest to the fascinations of the fair rival she had provided for her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland did not believe that her son could prove insensible to Opal's charms, so she wisely left things to take their own course, satisfied that the result would be what she most ardently wished.</p>
               <p>As soon as the morning meal was over, the ponies of Dora and Jenny were brought to the door, and attended by an elderly man, they set out for school, both of them internally rebelling against the fiat that separated them from their brother on this first day of his return to the home from which he had been so long absent. But both knew that remonstrance was useless, so they went upon their way.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland exerted herself to talk pleasantly with Fenton till the hour for their visit arrived, and she triumphed in the thought that he was returning to his old allegiance; that the influence she had always held over him was fast regaining its power.</p>
               <pb n="478-479" xml:id="VAC6338-00000232"/>
               <p>Fenton had a high admiration for his mother. He recognized the masculine strength of her character with that respect men of his calibre are apt to feel for it wherever it is to be found. Bitterly as he regretted his inability to compete with her on this question so vital to his happiness, he tacitly surrendered himself to her guidance, convinced that contention was useless.</p>
               <p>When the carriage came to the door he was ready to hand her in, and accompany her to Silvermere, where he knew temptation awaited him in the shape of the lovely and attractive creature Mrs. Markland was bent on making his wife.</p>
               <p>The road went through an undulating and picturesque country, and after a drive of four miles, they came in sight of the place to which they were bound. The house stood half a mile from the road, and was approached by a serpentine avenue shaded by magnificent forest trees.</p>
               <p>In a natural hollow on one side of this lay a deep, clear pool of water, from which the place derived its fanciful name. On the sloping bank stood a rustic pavilion made of the trunks of slender trees with the bark on, and thatched with moss. At the foot of a flight of stone steps a small boat, gayly painted, lay idly rocking upon the water.</p>
               <p>The house itself had few pretensions to architectural beauty. It was a massive and comfortable family mansion, built of brick and painted stone color, with a portico in front extending half its length. A green lawn, unbroken by the intrusion of shrubbery, spread away on either side, and, from the front of the dwelling, no cotton fields were visible.</p>
               <p>Everything about the place was substantial and in good taste, and Fenton found himself looking around with the complacent thought that all this might some day be his own if he could only make up his mind to forsake Inez, and use all his efforts to win the beautiful heiress, not only of this wide domain, but of gold beyond his wildest dreams of affluence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings had emigrated from New York, a struggling lawyer, with little beside his fine person and captivating manners. But they had sufficed, for they had won him the position he now held through his wife. He married a young widow who had herself gained fortune through a loveless union with an old man, who was accommodating enough to make his exit from the scene in the second year of their marriage, and blind enough to make his widow the heir to his immense estate.</p>
               <p>Her next choice was for love. She was devotedly attached to her husband, and, as had been hinted, was jealous to an absurd degree of every youthful or attractive woman who manifested the slightest interest in the man she considered her lawful property, who was bound to her by golden chains, if not by those of affection.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings fully appreciated all the obligations under which she had laid her husband by lifting him from poverty to affluence; and as he was by nature a man of gentle mould, she had gradually brought him to believe that as he owed everything to her, she was entitled to the unconditional submission of his life.</p>
               <p>But if Mr. Hastings was hen-pecked, he was not contemptible; for he possessed so many amiable and redeeming qualities, that it was impossible for those intimately known to him not to love and admire him. Yet he had great faults, too. His was a character of mixed good and evil so often found in this lower plane of being.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hastings was a devoted husband and father, and Opal loved him with a deeper and fonder affection than she bestowed on her affected, fine-lady mother. The sound of the carriage wheels brought both father and daughter on the<pb n="480-481" xml:id="VAC6338-00000233"/> portico, and as Mr. Hastings stands framed in the doorway of his dwelling, I will present him.</p>
               <p>He was a tall, well-made man, of florid complexion and finely-moulded features; his brown hair was partially silvered, as was the long flowing beard that fell upon his breast; his eyes were of a light, glittering blue, full of genial feeling and animation. He wore a comfortably fitting suit of gray cloth, and a black satin vest. The arrangement of his toilette showed that he was careful of his appearance, and had by no means forgotten that in his more youthful days he had borne the sobriquet of the "handsome Hastings."</p>
               <p>His manner was gracious and high-bred, and few men could comport themselves in society more agreeably than he did.</p>
               <p>Opal, in a dress of deep blue silk, trimmed with black lace, which rendered the brilliant fairness of her complexion more conspicuous, flitted past her father, and ran down the steps to receive the kiss with which Mrs. Markland greeted her. From childhood she had been a pet of the elder lady, and the affection was returned by that enthusiastic fondness which a young girl is apt to feel for a very handsome and elegant woman who makes much of her.</p>
               <p>With perfect frankness, Opal gave her hand to Fenton as she said:</p>
               <p>"We are so glad to have you back again, Godfrey. Papa has been talking of you all the morning, and he has ordered, not the fatted calf, but the fattest turkey, to be killed to-day in honor of your arrival; though I hope you won't imagine I mean to insinuate that he thinks you the prodigal son."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, indeed," replied Fenton, resisting the gallant impulse to raise to his lips the fair hand that rested a moment within his own. "I need scarcely tell you, Opal, how glad I am to revisit old scenes and old friends again."</p>
               <p>By this time the trio had ascended the steps, and after cordially greeting Mrs. Markland, Mr. Hastings warmly grasped the hand of the young man and said:</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you how rejoiced I am to greet you beneath my own roof once more, my dear boy. Your travels have greatly improved you, and I flatter myself that you will discover some change for the better in somebody else. Opal is almost a woman, as you see."</p>
               <p>"Quite, I should say, and a most charming one, too. I had no idea that two years could have wrought such a change in the child I left behind me when I last went away."</p>
               <p>Opal gleefully broke in:</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have sprung up like the bean stalk of Jack the Giant Killer. I am quite as tall as mamma; but I am only a school-girl yet, Mr. Godfrey Fenton, and my maternal ancestress will put her veto on compliments, so you had better be on your good behavior."</p>
               <p>He looked into the bewitching face of the fair speaker, fully sensible of its sweet girlish charm, and he thought:</p>
               <p>"No wonder is it that she is admired, for she is lovely as the morning and gay as the sunshine. What accursed fate led me away from my own home to find a rival for this girl, who is fair enough to be loved for her own sake by any man not besotted by such an infatuation as possesses me."</p>
               <p>Yes, it had come already, that he considered his passion for Inez an infatuation from which he must, at all hazards, arouse himself. He made a playful reply, and they all entered the wide hall, arched in the centre, with a windin staircase leading to the upper story.</p>
               <p>Morocco-covered lounges stood against the walls, and beyond the arch was a sideboard, on which decanters of spirit and an array of goblets were placed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings, in a gray moire-antique elaborately trimmed, and a lace cap ornamented with delicate flowers,<pb n="482-483" xml:id="VAC6338-00000234"/> appeared at the drawing-room door to welcome her guests. She was slightly rouged, and in a demi-light appeared almost too youthful to be the mother of a tall girl like Opal. She offered her hand to Fenton with the languid grace that characterized her, and drawled:</p>
               <p>"Do not think that I am less eager than my husband and daughter to welcome you to Silvermere, Godfrey, because I did not hasten out to meet you as they did. I am not so robust or quick in my movements as they are, but my regard for you is as strong as that of either of them. But I need not tell you that, for, by this time, you ought to know in what estimation we all hold you."</p>
               <p>Fenton lifted her hand to his lips, and gratefully replied:</p>
               <p>"I cannot tell you how happy I am to receive such assurances, Mrs. Hastings, for I have been so long away that I feared I might have lost my place in the good graces of my old friends. It seems like home to me here, and nothing is changed saved Opal, who is grown into a fairy princess since I saw her last."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my daughter has rapidly matured. People take her to be eighteen, but it is quite enough to have a tall girl like her calling me mother, without having two years added to her age."</p>
               <p>"What does that signify, dear madam, when you might pass for her elder sister?" was the gallant reply of the young man, for he knew that flattery was as welcome to the faded and exacting beauty as in the days of her blooming belle-hood.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings smiled sweetly, shook her finger at him, and said:</p>
               <p>"You have not forgotten how to say pleasant things, I perceive, Godfrey."</p>
               <p>And the party entered the large and elegantly appointed drawing-room.</p>
               <p>A black servant appeared, to take the bonnet and mantle of Mrs. Markland, and they sat down near the bright wood-fire that burned on the hearth. Wine and cake were brought in, and Mr. Hastings said to Fenton:</p>
               <p>"I need not ask you to take anything stronger, Godfrey, for I presume you are as temperate in your habits as in days of yore?"</p>
               <p>Fenton bowed in reply, and, with a slight frown, Mrs. Hastings said:</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not think of touching anything more stimulating than wine yourself, William. This is excellent champagne, and, in my opinion, it is the only liquor a gentleman should drink."</p>
               <p>"Pooh! my dear, that is ladies' tipple. Men of action like me prefer something that has more body to it. But, if you insist, I'll take a glass to drink to Godfrey's health and happiness."</p>
               <p>The glasses were filled and the toast pledged. Fenton made a little speech that pleased his hearers, and he felt himself quite established on his old footing of familiar friendship in the house of Mr. Hastings.</p>
               <p>Presently the bustle of another arrival was heard, and Mrs. Markland seemed slightly annoyed when Mrs. Langley entered, followed by her brother. She said to Opal, in a low voice:</p>
               <p>"I had hoped, on this first day of my son's return to his old friends, that we should have you to ourselves, my dear. But of course I have no right to object to any guests your mother may have chosen to ask to meet us. Excuse me, I spoke without thought."</p>
               <p>The flitting color that gave such a charm to the face of the young girl deepened, almost to a rose-tint as she hastily replied:</p>
               <p>"I am sorry that you do not like it, Mrs. Markland; but<pb n="484-485" xml:id="VAC6338-00000235"/> Mr. Denham and his sister are such near connections of yours, that mamma thought she must ask them to meet Godfrey to-day. No one else will be here."</p>
               <p>"Connections are often bores," thought the elder lady, but she smiled blandly, patted the cheek of Opal, and replied:</p>
               <p>"It does not signify: what can't be helped must be borne with a good grace!"</p>
               <p>And she turned to receive the greeting of the intruders as graciously as was possible in the state of vexation in which their advent had thrown her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley whispered to her brother:</p>
               <p>"I told you that Aunt Gertrude would be annoyed if we came, and so she is. I know her too well to be mistaken."</p>
               <p>"Well, let her be vexed; I chose to come, to look after my own interests," replied Denham in the same tone.</p>
               <p>And he approached his stately relative, and offered his hand with quiet friendliness, after giving Fenton a greeting which had little warmth in it.</p>
               <p>The two young men had spent their boyhood beneath the same roof, and a strong feeling of jealousy had grown up between them. As children, they had been equally cared for in the house of Mr. Markland; but, after his death, a material difference was made. Then Guy was made to feel that he was a dependent, and Godfrey assumed the place of the son of the house.</p>
               <p>Denham was noble, chivalrous, and high-toned by nature; yet he was but human, and he felt and resented in some measure the inferior position his uncle's widow forced him to assume. Since he attained manhood he acted as agent for Mrs. Markland, receiving a high salary for attending to her business affairs; but Denham knew very well that it had never been his uncle's intention that his step-son should be placed above his nephew.</p>
               <p>From the large jointure secured to Mrs. Markland, she had it in her power to save many thousands annually; and Guy knew that this was done to enable her son, at some future day, to aspire to the hand of the girl on whom his own heart was set. Denham would gladly have married Opal Hastings without a penny to her fortune, but aware of the family arrangement which existed, he had never betrayed his preference for her till after his return from Newport.</p>
               <p>After the confidences which passed between Mrs. Langley and Fenton, and his assurances that he should never claim the hand of Opal, Denham had been less cautious, though he still considered her too young to be wooed as his wife. He was willing to "bide his time," and he began to indulge the sweet hope that Opal was not beyond his reach. Within the last few months, some property had fallen to him from a distant relative, and Denham felt with joy that when he made known his pretensions to her family he could not be regarded as a needy fortune-hunter in pursuit of a well-endowed heiress.</p>
               <p>Fenton shook hands with him, and said:</p>
               <p>"I must congratulate you, Guy, on the good luck that has befallen you. I hear that your cousin, Mark Denham, made you his heir. I only wish <emph>I</emph> had a rich relative who would be so accommodating as to step off the shores of time and leave me something handsome in his will."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; but I scarcely think that you should ask for more than you will one day posses. Enough is enough for any man."</p>
               <p>"You know the old adage, that 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," replied Fenton, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>His mother frowned, and with some stateliness said:</p>
               <p>"With such prospects as yours, Godfrey, it seems absurd to speak thus about Guy's little fortune. At my death you will have twice as much."</p>
               <pb n="486-487" xml:id="VAC6338-00000236"/>
               <p>"But I hope you'll live to the age of Methuselah, mother, and in the meantime, you know, a fellow likes to feel that he has something of his own to look to. The pitiful three hundred a year, left me by my father, seems absolute penury beside Guy's thousands. But I don't envy you, old fellow, in spite of what I have said; and I know that you will make a good use of your money."</p>
               <p>"There is not so much of it, after all, Godfrey, but with good management it will form the nucleus of a fortune to be enjoyed some day."</p>
               <p>"With some 'fair minister,' I suppose, who will become the Egeria of your life—eh, Denham?"</p>
               <p>The dark, expressive face of the young man flushed, and he glanced toward Opal as he replied:</p>
               <p>"That is as it may be. I have not settled my future destiny, and all my plans may 'gang agee.'"</p>
               <p>Fenton noticed the look, and understood it. He remembered what he had said to Mrs. Langley at Newport, and he doubted not that she had repeated his words to her brother. Now he regretted having spoken them, and felt annoyed that the brother and sister should have become aware of his entanglement with Inez Lopez; for the consciousness that Denham was his rival with Opal, awakened in his heart a strong desire to put forward his own claims on her.</p>
               <p>With every passing moment, Fenton felt himself more deeply fascinated by the artless child of nature he was urged to love, and with his natural inconstancy, he began to think the fair one nearest to him at the moment, the most attractive. It was the fault of his temperament, so why should we be too hard on him? and then he felt pressed to the wall by his imperious mother till no power of resistance remained in him.</p>
               <p>It was fortunate for him, he thought, that he found Opal so charming, for it was evidently decreed that he should marry her, and after all, he might be able to forget her rival, and be as comfortably happy with her as if the glamour of his passion for Inez had never been thrown over him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley presently turned to Fenton, and referring to the previous conversation, said:</p>
               <p>"By the way, speaking of wills reminds me of the one in which your friend, Miss Lopez, was so deeply interested. Did she finally succeed in regaining her grandfather's estate?"</p>
               <p>At the name of Inez, a lightning flash came from the eyes of Mrs. Markland, but her audacious niece was impervious to its meaning and waited calmly for Fenton's reply. He coldly said:</p>
               <p>"She did not. Miss Lopez gets nothing more than the annuity bequeathed to her by her aunt. The estate goes to charities."</p>
               <p>She piercingly regarded him, and in a tone of sarcasm asked:</p>
               <p>"And her adoring lover? Did he desert her when he found that she had lost her inheritance? I hope not—for I should be sorry to think so meanly of him as that, Godfrey."</p>
               <p>He colored, shrugged his shoulders, and said:</p>
               <p>"What would you have, Cousin Anna? It is the way of the world. The poor fellow loved her very dearly, but what could he do when her chances of fortune were gone? and her decrepit father left to be taken care of out of her pittance. It was a bitter struggle to him, I know, but it was made, and—it was <emph>successful.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Fenton looked Mrs. Langley full in the eyes as he spoke the last word with such emphasis, and she understood that it was thrown as the gage of battle between them.</p>
               <pb n="488-489" xml:id="VAC6338-00000237"/>
               <p>She contemptuously retorted:</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to hear it, for if ever a man was bound in honor to a woman that one was bound to the poor girl who, in losing her fortune, lost everything. I feel the deepest sympathy for <emph>her,</emph> for she believed in him; she loved him far better than he merited."</p>
               <p>"I dare say, but what says the proverb? 'Man is inconstant ever,' and this is but a new illustration of it."</p>
               <p>"Yes—and I suppose her lover has already sought a new field of action. Such a trifler with women's hearts as he is must of course have a new love, as soon as he is off with the old one."</p>
               <p>"Exactly—only with this difference, that the person in question only returned to his first allegiance, for he had loved another before he met with the fair Inez. Only for a season had his heart strayed from its legitimate possessor. When he was thrown with his early love again, his feelings revived in all their pristine force and freshness."</p>
               <p>With cutting disdain Mrs. Langley replied:</p>
               <p>"One would think such hearts put out at compound interest, to be recalled when most convenient for the worldly success of their owners. It is shameful to find that human nature can be so mercenary."</p>
               <p>Fenton bit his lip and flushed angrily, but the reply he was meditating was interrupted by Opal, who had lost the greater portion of this duel of words while listening with brightening eyes and deepening color to some low-toned words spoken to her by Denham. They were not words of love, for he had not yet ventured so far, but his manner and tones made her blush, she scarcely knew why.</p>
               <p>She laid her hand on Mrs. Langley's and asked:</p>
               <p>"Who are you denouncing so severely, my dear friend? It is not like you to he so harsh in your censures."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley carelessly replied:</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind, my dear, who it was. Godfrey is intimate with the object of my indignation, and I trust that he will have the full benefit of my opinion of his conduct."</p>
               <p>"You do not suppose that Godfrey will turn tale-bearer, I hope, Mrs. Langley, and make his friend uncomfortable by repeating to him your strong expression of disapprobation? Oh, fie! that would be giving him a character I am sure he does not deserve."</p>
               <p>"No—I scarcely think he <emph>will</emph> repeat what I said just now," replied Mrs. Langley, very dryly; and she turned to Mrs. Hastings and began to give her an animated description of some beautiful dresses she had received from New Orleans.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings listened with vivid interest, as she always did to anything concerning the toilette. She said:</p>
               <p>"I always get my things from Paris. Such loves of robes and caps as those French people do make can't be matched anywhere else, and then their charges are so much more reasonable. Not that I care particularly about that; but when I get a thing, I like it to be the best of its kind, and to know that I have paid no more than it is really worth."</p>
               <p>"Yes, what we <emph>buy</emph> should be the best of its kind, and it is easy enough in the matter of clothes; but when it comes to something more important, we often fail to get our money's worth."</p>
               <p>"What can you mean?" asked Mrs. Hastings, half inclined to be offended, in the belief that Mrs. Langley referred to the husband her own fortune had doubtless secured for her. "I am sure I do not understand you."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I was only thinking of the many bogus things in this world that are taken in exchange for sterling gold; but I was not referring to you particularly. You have been singularly fortunate so far as you are <emph>yourself</emph> concerned."</p>
               <pb n="490-491" xml:id="VAC6338-00000238"/>
               <p>Mrs. Markland frowned portentously, and curtly said:</p>
               <p>"You are in one of your bitter and sarcastic moods today, Anna; and I suppose you will go on cutting right and left without regarding the feelings of others. I always dread an encounter with you when you are in such a humor."</p>
               <p>"Don't be alarmed, Aunt Gertrude, for I have exhausted my venom for to-day, and I intend to be the pink of propriety till we part. You must be very happy to have Godfrey at home again, as I perceive that he comes in the most amiable and compliant of moods. Such an obedient son is a real treasure."</p>
               <p>How far she was sincere, or whether all was bitter sarcasm, Mrs. Markland was at a loss to determine. She knew that Mrs. Langley was aware of Fenton's passion for Inez Lopez, and the passage at arms so lately ended between them she had not been able to understand; for, while it lasted, Mr. Hastings had been speaking with her on a subject of much interest to them both, and she was compelled to give him her undivided attention.</p>
               <p>She steadily regarded her niece as she replied:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to assure you that Godfrey is all that I could wish. If his fancies have, for a season, wandered from his home, and the interests centered there, I am happy to see that they are returning to their proper channels. The old influence is established again, and I am delighted to inform you that he finds Opal more charming than ever. He encountered her yesterday in Natchez, and came home quite enraptured with her beauty. She is looking her best to-day."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hastings had left them to speak with her husband, the young men were occupied with Opal on the opposite side of the room, and the two ladies enjoyed the opportunity of a tête-à-tête. Mrs. Langley replied to the last remark:</p>
               <p>"Yes, Opal is always charming, and I am not surprised to hear that Godfrey was struck with her improved appearance. From your words, and his manner toward her, I suppose the other affair is at an end. Yet it seems a pity, for the poor girl was deeply attached to him, and I believe he loved her as well as he is capable of loving any one."</p>
               <p>"Don't refer to that folly, Anna, if you please. It is disgusting to me to hear that Godfrey wandered for a single hour from his allegiance to Opal. She is the sweetest and loveliest creature in the world, and the only girl he shall ever bring home to my house as his wife."</p>
               <p>"Will you not allow <emph>her</emph> a voice in the disposal of herself?" asked Mrs. Langley, with provoking coolness. "Perhaps she will not accept Godfrey after all, and she will be rich enough to choose a husband for herself."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Markland drew herself up haughtily.</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> view of the case had not occurred to me, nor do I thank Mrs. Langley for suggesting it. <emph>My</emph> son is a fitting mate for the best in the land, and I flatter myself that he will not woo an unwilling bride."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I didn't expect thanks, Aunt Gertrude. People don't often get them for speaking the plain truth. As to Godfrey, I used to think a great deal of him; but I am sorry to say that I am losing faith in him. But I won't annoy you by speaking ill of your heart's darling, and here comes Mrs. Hastings in the nick of time to bring me back to <foreign xml:lang="FRA">les convenances.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>She flitted away and joined the trio gathered around the piano. Fenton had opened the instrument, and, placing a favorite song on the music-stand, he requested Opal to sing it for him. She sat down to do so, but deprecatingly said:</p>
               <p>"You will be disappointed when you hear me play, Godfrey, for I have had few musical advantages yet. After listening to such fine performers as you must have heard<pb n="492-493" xml:id="VAC6338-00000239"/> at the North, you will think my efforts scarcely worth notice."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to be the judge of that, if you please. You have music in your soul, and I am persuaded that it must find expression through your fingers."</p>
               <p>She laughed, and rapidly ran over the keys as she replied:</p>
               <p>"You always have something pleasant to say at any rate, Godfrey; and if I tortured your ears with discords, you would manage to find some consolation for my failure. I like to be praised, remember, even if I know that I have not done well."</p>
               <p>"Your music is always charming to me, Opal, and I am as critical a judge as Godfrey, I fancy, for my ear is more correct than his," said Denham.</p>
               <p>She gave him a radiant glance, and dashed off into a brilliant waltz, to which her flying fingers gave full effect. When she paused she said:</p>
               <p>"I had rather not sing to-day, so you must wait till some other time for your song, Godfrey. I play almost entirely by ear; but, oh dear, when my new governess comes I must begin to read notes and count time, I suppose. I quite dread what I shall have to go through with; but there is one comfort, she is a young lady, and papa says she will be as much of a companion for me as a teacher."</p>
               <p>"Has your father actually engaged a governess for you?" asked Mrs. Langley. "I knew that he talked of it, but I was not aware that he had carried out his purpose."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he has the promise of one, and she will be with us very soon now. She has been ill, or she would have been at Silvermere before this time."</p>
               <p>"Who is she? Do you know anything of her?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing except her name. She is a Miss Gordon from New Haven."</p>
               <p>With all his command of countenance, Fenton felt himself self growing pale at this announcement, and a look of consternation passed between the three persons near the speaker.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Langley eagerly inquired:</p>
               <p>"What is her first name? I knew a Miss Gordon from that place, but it is quite impossible that <emph>she</emph> is the person who has undertaken to instruct you, Opal."</p>
               <p>"She has a very pretty name. Nina Gordon is but a few years older than I am, and papa thinks that I shall be quite charmed with her. I think so, too, for she has written a very pretty letter to my father, which he received only yesterday. She is on her way to Natchez by this time, under the care of Mr. Matson, who lately went north on business."</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"WHO SHALL BE VICTOR?" the Sequel to "THE CANCELLED WILL," shows the result of Nina Gordon's advent at Silvermere, and answers the question, "Who am I?" asked in the first chapter of this volume.</p>

            <p>Desire to direct the close attention of all lovers of good novel reading to the works and authors contained in their new catalogue, just issued. A strict scrutiny is solicited, because the books enumerated in it are among the most popular now in existence. In supplying your wants and taste in the reading line, it is of the first importance that you should give special attention to what is popularly designated entertaining reading matter. No library is either attractive or complete without a collection of novels and romances. The experience of many years has demonstrated that light reading is essential to even the most studious men and women, furnishing the mind with healthful recreation: while to the young, and to those that have not cultivated a taste for solid works of science, it forms one of the best possible training schools, gradually establishing, in a pleasant manner, that habit of concentration of thought absolutely necessary to read understandingly the more ponderous works, which treat of political economy, the sciences, and of the arts.</p>
            <p>We publish and sell at very low rates, full and varied editions of the works of all the famous American and Foreign Novelists, whose writings are very entertaining, specially adapted for all readers.

SOUTHWORTH, whose romances are always in demand; MRS. ANN S. STEPHENS, the well-known favorite; MRS. HENRY WOOD, the authoress of "East Lynne;" MRS. CAROLINE LEE HENTZ, whose stories of Southern life stand unparalleled in their simple truth and exquisite beauty; MRS. C. A. WARFIELD, another very popular Southern writer; MISS ELIZA A. DUPUY, who has made a wonderful mark; MRS. F. H. BURNETT, the authoress of "Theo;" the charming and pathetic French and Russian romances of HENRY GREVILLE; the wonderful and famous fictions of GUSTAVE FLAUBERT; the brilliant and artistic works of OCTAVE FEUILLET; the highly finished and powerful stories of ERNEST DAUDET; the popular and pleasing productions of PROSPER MERIMEE; the beautiful and touching love tales of the celebrated GEORGE SAND; the clever and intensely interesting writings of JULES SANDEAU; the exciting and ingenious novels of ADOLPHE BELOT; the picturesque and enchaining works of MADAME ANGELE DUSSAUD; the exquisitely pathetic romances of the PRINCESS ALTIERI; the strong and graphic productions of ANDRE THEURIET; the wild frontier sketches of GUSTAVE AIMARD; the classic and refined works of MADAME DE STAEL; the absorbing and vivid fictions of ALEXANDER DUMAS, Pere; the natural and forcible novels of ALEXANDER DUMAS, Fils; the startling and mysterious romances of EUGENE SUE; the trenchant and unique narratives of VICTOR HUGO; the realistic novels of EMILE ZOLA, which have had a sale in this country unparalleled in the history of recent book-making; GEORGE W. M. REYNOLDS, whose romances of London life, founded on facts, are of matchless interest; SIR WALTER SCOTT, whose "Waverley" novels still maintain a strong hold on the people. CHARLES DICKENS' complete writings we furnish in every variety of style. We publish also the weird stories of GEORGE LIPPARD; the martial novels of CHARLES LEVER; the comical nautical tales of CAPTAIN MARRYAT; EMERSON BENNETT'S Indian stories; HENRY COCKTON'S laughable narratives; T. S. ARTHUR'S temperance tales and household stories; the wonderful and entertaining novels of EUGENE SUE and W. H. AINSWORTH; the quiet domestic novels of FREDRIKA BREMER and ELLEN PICKERING; the masterly novels of WILKIE COLLINS; FRANK FAIRLEGH'S quaint stories, and SAMUEL WARREN'S elaborate romances; the works of MRS. C. J. NEWBY, MRS. GREY, and MISS PARDOE; W. H. HERBERT'S sporting stories; and the graphic Italian romances of T. A. TROLLOPE; also the fascinating writings of G. P. R. JAMES, MRS. S. A. DORSEY, SIR EDWARD BULWER LYTTON, JAMES A. MAITLAND, THE SHAKSPEARE NOVELS, CHARLES G. LELAND (Hans Breitmann), Dow's Patent Sermons, DOESTICKS, and HENRY MORFORD, as well as FRANCATELLI'S, MISS LESLIE'S, and all the best Cook Books; Petersons' "Dollar Series of Good Novels;" Petersons' "Sterling Series" of entertaining books; Petersons' popular "Square 12mo. Series" of excellent stories; together with hundreds of others, by the best authors in the world.</p>
            <p>Look over our Catalogue, and enclose a Draft or Post Office Order for five, ten, twenty, or fifty dollars, or more, to us in a letter, and write for what books you wish, and on receipt of the money, or a satisfactory reference, the books will be packed and sent to you at once, in any way you may direct.
