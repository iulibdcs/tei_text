The author was a singular character, and there are features in the story which are as singular as he. He was an American by birth-at least I believe so-but of foreign education, con- nected in some political manner with the Irish ex- iles, and of no particular religion but the "religion of a gentleman." When I knew him, his original radicalism anpd revolutionary ardor had melted down under the influence of a long residence in this free country, into a mild, ripe, nutty-brown Madeira tone of well-preserved conservatism, the bouquet of which would have diffused pleasure and sympathy at the table of old Kit North. His read- ing lay at that time in the classics of the Augustan age of Elizabeth,-Sidney, Shakspeare, &amp;c.; and the influence of such studies is plainly seen in the followring narrative. They tell a good story in "Gotham" of the late Mrs. L-d, wife of the wealthy tobacconist. Mrs. L--d at that time lived in great splendor,    <pb n="4-5 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC6851-00000003"/> 4         PREFACE. and was much courted as well on account of her social qualities as of her wealth. She was paying a morning call, and on entering the well-filled drawing-room, was saluted by the hostess-it was one of those lapses of the tongue or the memory, which no one can at all times avoid-with"IHow do you do, my dear Mrs. MACCABOY?"Maccaboy, as every one knows, is the name of a celebrated Scotch snuff. Of course, there was a general in- voluntary smile, and a partial laugh, in which Mrs. L-d,--a well-bred woman she seems to have been,-good-naturedly joined. "I am sure," said she, coming to the relief of her embarrassed host- ess, "that it was a very natural mistake." It may possibly have been the recollection of this anecdote which induced the author to spell the name (in the following pages) with an Me instead of an M-a-c, i. e. in the Irish and not in the Scotch mode. Whatever may have been his mo- tive, it could not have been ignorance; and I have, therefore, not thought it permissible to deviate from his orthography.   CONTENTS. PAGE CHAP. I.

IT is well known that the city of Gotham is the commercial capital of the most flourishing empire of the New World. This city has no walls--gray, turreted, and bristling with cannon-like the naval cities of the old continent; nor quays of solid masonry, like the world-renowned capitals of Erin and Muscovy; but instead, long lines of wooden wharves, crowded with the shipping of all nations, and washed by the great river Hendrick, so called from its discoverer's name, who was a Dutchman. The Hendrick, in truth, is a noble stream, which comes down from a region of lakes and mountains in a mighty and swelling volume of "waters, till it blends with an arm of the sea, (itself    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6851-00000005"/> 8      BLONDE AND BRUNETE., seeming another,) that foams and heaves between the islands at its mouth, and so forms, just at the extremity of the city- of Gotham, which occupies one of them, the great bay of Manhatta, wherein it is believed all the navies of the world might easily ride. The city of Gotham is an island, as we have said; and once it was a beautiful island, affording to the gaze of him who sailed along its shores, an agreeable mixture of rock and grove, topping hill and marshy low ground, sparkling here and there with the villas or country-houses of the wealthy Gothamites, mostly built of wood painted white, and adorned with long verandahs quite encircling them; or showing at some turn a humbler, but sub- stantial abode, nooked under a mighty horse-chest- nut, the head-quarters of a milk-farm, with cattle (whose tinkling bells you could hear in the still evening) grazing on its wild up-hilly pasture-land. On the opposite side of the broad, sealike river, towards the going down of the sun, lies a much bolder shore, composed of fine hills and jutting promontories covered with forest, forming the most beautiful bays or coves with the river, (a great careless male flirt that just toyed with the willing banks as it went by,) and soon after, passing into a sterner range of steep and lofty cliffs of trap-rock,   SOME PRELIMNARY DESCRIPTION.     9 dike maidens of a coyer and more prudish temper,) the precipitous faces of which were thickly garnish- ed with shrubs and the stoney ledge crowned with evergreen trees. When the sun sets over these western shores of the Hendrick, (a reputed un- healthiness had preserved them in their native wildness,) they assume a fine purplish tone, and early in the morning, -when the same luminary- bringing light to the Gothamites-has risen upon them, they reflect his rays with great power, and are visible even across the broad, low-lying penin- sula of Castra Occidentis, and the wide tide-chan- nel called Fiume Oriente, to spectators placed upon the distant heights of Isola Lunga.* Anciently, as antiquity is reckoned in the New World, in sailing up past these beautiful river. shores, you arrived abreast of an out-jutting point, green and cultured, lying below the receding back. ground of wood and rocky height, and terminating riverward by a round fort of dark stone, grimly pierced with embrasures for cannon, and sweetly laved by the very waters of the Hendrick, which, at high water, made a kind of fresh-water sea. * By Castra Occidentis, the humorous writer seems to mean Westchester; by Fiume Oriente, the East River, and Isola Luwnga, almost evidently indicates Long Island, These affectations are perplexing.,-[ED, 1*    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6851-00000006"/> 10     BLONDE AND BRUNETTrE. weed mark on the circling masonry of the disman- tled battery. For grass grew on the rampart walk, and within the safe inclosure, (it was nat- urally gravelled,) which, at the date we write of, was continuous with the garden terrace of a coun- try-house, inhabited by a Gothamite merchant of those days. A very pretty mansion it was, considering that the taste for cottage-architecture was not yet de- veloped among the people of the land-a plain, double house of gray stone, that seemed to have been quarried from the topping cliffs behind, a whited wooden verandah along the front, and a trellised arcade to the right, which took a bend after a dozen yards, and skirting the lawn, led down quite to the water-side. A very great eln shaded the lawn, and with its far stretching branch- es partly- hid the outline of the mansion. On the narrow beach of fine dark sand and round pebble below, were a boat-house and a bathing-house, both of wood, supported on piles, and partially project- ing into the water at all times. The whole aspect of things gave a pleasant notion of leisure and rural retirement to the people who marked the place from the sheltered deck of the passing steam- boat. This sentiment of the traveller would be height-   SOME PRELIMNARY DESCRIPTION.   " ened sometimes by the sight of a family group in the verandah of the house, or, on some fine after- noon, seated under the shade of the great elm on the lawn, or at a still later hour, say sunset or twi- light, leisurely promenading on the rampart or es- planade of the old round battery which formed so picturesque and peculiar a part of the little domain. Then, the white hairs of a man in the declining day of manhood, the ribboned cap of a matron, (caps Were worn by the middle-aged women in those times,) the ringleted heads and white drap- ery of a couple of fair girls just on the edge of womanhood, the round jackets and short, be-sashed dresses of younger children, now and then the manly forms of some young men grown, presented a due mixture of ages and sexes that suggested a thousand pleasant thoughts.    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6851-00000007"/> CHAPTER I. MR. AND MRS. BLAKE. THS family, who lived in a spot so pleasant and secluded, yet overlooking a great highway of traffic and travel, a noiseless, dustless highway, that was a source of amusement to them and not of annoyance-this family affords the subject of the following tale, which in all its essential features is a true story. The name of the Gothamite merchant was Blake-Patrick Blake, a npmen and cognomen which say as much for his origin and probable birth-place, as well as for his religion, as volumes could. The fact is that Mr. Blake, who, by his in- timates, was familiarly termed Pat Blake, was a native of a certain green island, famous for its lakes and mountains, its caves and basaltic, columnar rocks, its wastes too, its wet marshes, (which the inhabitants call bogs,) its holy fountains and wells, and also for a vast number of ruined castles, and   MR. AND MRS. BLAKE.      13 churches worse than ruined, noted also for the superstitious adherence of its people-the pisantry especially-to an antiquated religion which was professed many hundred years ago by the civilized world, but has been long since exploded among those who follow the light of their own reason. This people are Celtic by derivation, and Mr. Pa- trick Blake, as we have said, was one of them, of the same race and of the same faith. In the early part of his career in what he was wont to call" the country of his adoption," Mr. Blake married a native Gothamite lady, who, hav- ing been bred in the form of religion prevalent among the inhabitants of Gotham, was of a con- trary faith, as well as of a different race from him- self; a circumstance evidently showing that the antiquated faith of his fathers, or perhaps it would be more true to say, Religion itself, was a matter which then influenced Mr. Blake's practical con- duct less powerfully than a great desire of getting on in the world, or, may be, the charms of a beau- tiful and interesting woman. Indeed it may very well have been that both these considerations and inducements acted upon Mr. Blake to determine his choice of a partner for life, as Mrs. Blake was both a lady (at the time he married her) of great personal attractions and captivating manners, and    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6851-00000008"/> "    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. also possessed of a portion of worldly goods, which though not large in itself was sufficient to seem highly desirable in the eyes of Mr. Blake, who (if the truth must be told) had little or nothing. How it happened that Mr. Pat Blake, who from shop boy and clerk had risen to be junior part- ner to her sire, managed to carry off the coveted hand of the beautiful and accomplished Miss Julia Bailey, third daughter and co-heiress of the wealthy jobber of that name, (old Bailey did not cut up so well as was expected, but still he left a handsome fortune to be divided among a large family of girls,) was, and is a mystery. Mr. Blake did not boast (it must be owned) any extraordinary personal ad- vantages to account for such a notable success. He had red hair; a complexion of the most san. guine order, remarkably given to freckle and brown in the hot summers of Gotham; features, what might be called national, but of the unhand- some type of his race, (which has been cast in two moulds-one quite common and 6ne of exquisite elegance,) an ugly nose, a large prominent mouth with a most formidable set of teeth, eyes small and bloodshot, a forehead indeed pretty well! formed and massive, but which in so young a man as he was then, was less noticed than the rest of his honest but unheroic physiognomy. Mr. Blake   MR. AND MRS. BLAKE.      15 had moreover a peculiar accent, which in relation to his country-people obtains a particular name and is called brogue. He had the disadvantage, besides, among his elegant Gothamite rivals, (the young drygoods-men and drygoods-men's clerks who vis- ited Mr. Bailey's,) of being what is called a Pos- itive in religion (or something beginning with a P) -and the greater disadvantage of being rather ashamed of it. He was often twitted with, and ridiculed on account of, his nation, his accent, his antiquated faith, his red hair, his bull-dog nose; and his ugly mug altogether. And yet he carried off Miss Julia Bailey, the prettiest of the whole set of Bailey girls, and not the least sensible! These things are unaccountable. I have thought that opportunity is a word that might explain the mysterious fact of Mr. Pat Blake's success in this instance. For example, he boarded with his employer, (a close, formal old fel- low was Bailey pere, and adhered rigidly to ancient economical customs,) and that gave him opportu- nities. I have no doubt this was partly the secret of it, and the remainder lay in Mr. Blake's posses- sion of certain qualities which these opportunities were precisely needful to display. He was of a far more ardent and impassioned nature than the young Gothamites, his rivals. He had an astonishing fund    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6851-00000009"/> 16     BLONDE AND BRUNETtlE. of rich, real humor, moreover, which in the aban- don of the domestic circle he disbursed liberally, to the infinite delight of the Bailey girls, (except Miss Bailey, who was rather prim and pious, and continued Mifiss Bailey to her dying day,) and to the especial gratification of Miss Julia, who, though she seldom uttered a witticism herself, had a keen appreciation of wit in others. And Patrick Blake's wit was kindly, grotesque, warm-hearted. The very display of his teeth in laughing was heart- cheering, from the absence of all malice, the gen- iality of his homely smile, He wasn't so elegant, true, as the young Gothamites, Julia's admirers, but his frame, inherited from a long line of healthy, virtuous peasant ancestors, was far more strongly built and more vigorously developed. His was an arm fit to wield a shillelah, and on which a slender, graceful, lithe wisp of a girl, like Julia Bailey, might fairly lean with a good deal of natural pleas- ure and confidence, as thinking it able to protect and support her. Any how Blake was an honest fellow, and had what is called a good heart. ie looked to the main chance, it is true, but that was natural to a man of his position, who had his way to make, and had made it so far by his own energy and industry. There are always ill-natured versions, too, of   MR. AND MRS. BLAKE.      17 such affairs; and I have heard it said. (Heaven for- bid that I should relate mere tittle-tattle, much more retail scandal, but this concerns our moraD , -I have heard it said by a very intimate friend of Miss Julia Bailey that was, (subsequently Mrs. Pa- trick Blake,) that that young lady, shortly before she accepted Mr. Blake's proposals, which she once refused, was "over head and ears in love" (the very expression of my informant) with the celebra- ted beau Tom Tremaine, who visited at her father's and paid Julia a great deal of attention--" treated her shamefully, in fact," said Miss X. Y.,-and that Julia's sudden engagement to her future husband took place immediately after Tom ran away, as all' the world knows he did, with Miss McAboy, the daughter of the famous Scotch tobacconist. But if any one infers from these facts (granting they are facts) that Julia's resolution was prompted by pique, or was an act of despair, it is my belief he is mistaken. From my knowledge of her char- acter I feel certain, if the circumstances were as alleged, that Miss Julia's behavior indicated sim- ply a timely heart-cure, a healthy cicatrization of a wound that was never life-deep, a cordial, sensible turning from a poor, worthless, detected fop, whose merits were in his waistcoats and whiskers, to a genuine man, with a heart in his bosom, and prin-    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6851-00000010"/> 18     BLONDE AND BRUNIETE. ciples of virtue laid up there, too; for that was the difference between the elegant Tom Tremaine, with his straight Greek profile and fragrant, scent- ed, Macassar-oiled black curls, and red-haired, freckled, homely Paddy Blake. We do not say that there wasn't a hitch when the ceremony came to be performed which made these two one. There was a difficulty which Mr. Blake must ever have dimly seen in the background of his wooing. The priest of his faith, whom, to tell the truth, he too seldom consulted, had something to say-it was not altogether in approval (as Mr. Blake doubtless anticipated)-and a condition to impose before he could sanction, or a higher authority still dispense. The difficulty, however, was got over, the prom- ises were made, by whom I cannot aver. Those were lax days, I have heard ministers of the same religion affirm. Their Church winked at evils she could not prevent, and promises were made which were never meant to be kept, and things asserted for true, which had no place in reality., I am pos- itively sure that Miss Julia Bailey (that was) never gave any such promise as that her future offspring by Mr. Blake- should be brought up in his faith; I am sure that Mr. Blake never ran the risk of mak- ing a proposition that his fair intended would have regarded as vulgar impertinence; (for young damn   M. AND MBRS. BLAKE,      19 sels about to be married have no idea: of any here- afters of that kind-how should they?) the match would have been broken off, very likely; and in short, for an infinity of reasons, I am convinced that Mr. Blake obtained the concurrence, such as it was, of the Church to which he belonged, in his marriage, by representations which I would gently characterize as devoid of truth. He never ap- proached the subject with Miss Julia nearer than to sound her on the sentiments .which she enter. tained towards his ancient creed generally, nor ever had a more definite understanding than that if he would go to church occasionally with her, she wouldn't mind as a rule, (seeing that he had no choice,) going wife-like with him. Mr. Blake argued that this concession involved every thing, and so that important difficulty was got comfortably over. Things went well with the Blakes. Papa- Bai. ley died of a stroke of apoplexy, and Mr. Blake came in for a handsome slice of the estate. The business was reorganized, and Mr. Blake became senior partner of the new firm. He dealt cautious- ly, (most of his countrymen do,) and trusted to quiet, regular gains. His capital increased; his business still grew; Mr. Blake passed for a rich man in those days, he kept his house in the city of Go- tham, No* 18 Old Bailey Street, (on St. Nicholas' o    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6851-00000011"/> 20     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. Park, for which the Blakes had a key,) and his pleasant country seat at Red Fort, Where the fam- ily lived from the middle of May to the first of No- vember. Here the summer afternoons were cool- ed by the shadow of the western hills, and fresh- ened by the sea-breeze that found its way through the "Harrows" and agross the Bay and up the wide river to Mr. Blake's vine-embowered veran- dah. Here the hay smelled sweet on the meadows that environed the gardens; here the Indian corn rustled on the side of the lane that led to the vil- lage, just one mile off. Here the table of the Blakes was supplied with abundance of rich cream, warm fresh milk, curds, eggs, all sorts of summer berries just picked from the garden beds, or from the bush-overgrown heights. Here the children bathed, boated and fished, and the older boys went shooting on the partridge-whirring hills. But es- pecially on the summer evenings, when Mr. Blake returned from his" store," (or as novel-writers say, his '"counting-house,") here the moonlight was beautiful on the river, and the starlight on the ram- parts of the old red sullen fort; and the gravelled walks were merry with laughter, and the verandah was sacred to repose and quiet conversation; till the golden and crimson Autumn visited the heights of Seawalken and the crest of the Arrowheads, and   MR. AND MRS. BLAKE.      21 the nuts were ripe in the woods, and fires glowed night and morning, -fore-tokening a speedy return to Old Bailey Street, and the soon succeeding Christmas holidays in Santaklaus Square. The Blakes passed for and were a happy family. They had all that "heart can wish." The sons were healthy, obedient, affeqtionate and moral; the daughters were gentle, modest and fair. Some of the children died in infancy, but this could cause no deep regret, even in a worldly point of view, since the major part survived; nor in a religious, because, whatever view one might take of such questions, they were on the safe side, having been all bap- tized by the pastor of the church of St. Petrus in Gotham.  Luckily Mrs. Blake "belonged to no church," as the phrase is, and so, without a promise, by the natural effect of such a position, the children were gathered into Christ's everlasting fold by a minister of the church of which her husband was (we fear) an unworthy member. And in time' it. happened, or (as she believed) it arrived by the good providence and grace of God, that Mrs. Blake, from frequently attending church at old St. Petrus, and hearing the sermons and instructions there, and reading books that fell in her way naturally as a consequence of this, and pushed by certain prac- tical difficulties in regard to the training of her    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6851-00000012"/> 22     BLONDE AND BRUNEITE. children which occurred to her spontaneously, without even exchanging a word with her husband on the subject, and without his being aware of the change till it was past, began to inquire earnestly and sought private satisfaction for doubts that now caused her perplexity and grief, then prayed de- voutly for light, lastly (as she believed) obtained it, and returning. one day, at the dinner hour, some- what late, astonished and almost offended her hus- band by saying, in answer to his queries,-' I have been to confession, Paddy "--so she used to call him when she wished to be particularly tender or felt especially happy. And Mr. Pat Blake thus learned that his wife had become a neophyte ofthe faith to which his conscience told him he had not been remarkably faithful.   CHAPTER III. THE TWO HEROINES ARE DESCRIBED. THE walls of the old battery (an English engi- neer built them in the time of the Revolution) were massive, and the top presented a smooth walk, guarded by a low parapet on the outer side, and interiorly by a slight iron rail, running about half way round. A light stair of wood led to this ram- part-walk from the gun-platform, which was itself accessible by stone steps. One lovely evening in August, the two young women before spoken of as sometimes visible in this pretty domain, were- seated on the edge of the parapet just mentioned. From afar their white dresses gleamed against the dark background of the distant wooded hills. The fort and the grounds were already in shadow, but the red sunlight streamed over more than half the river, and bathed the opposite shore. It is not impossible they knew how picturesque they were, perched on the parapet    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6851-00000013"/> 2- 4 .

There wi - ilar difference in their characters. Xanthine was quick, mobile, animated and full of gay anie was sedate, thoughtful, reserved, and ye-flfull of suppressed ardor. Xanthine was universally pop- ular; Melanie was highly prized by a judicious few. Xanthine had a hundred bosom friends; Melanie had none but Xanthine, whom she tender- ly loved. Xanthine had been in love already more tke, though only eighteen, and kept a it" mirers; Melanie, at twenty, had never  :ve6r, nor ever had fancied herself in love with anybody. She had a satirical turn, (it was   THE TWO AHERRI ARE DESCRIBElb.   27 the shape her father's wI took in ,her,) and t beaux who frequented, whelier their city nm ion  or their country villa, all came in for their:: of her sharp things.

T;tell the truth, that sober, graceful little head oe  older sister was full of enthusiastic no- tions, while the sunny temper and roseate bloom of Xanthine covered also a secret and innocent seriousness, which made her often call herself to account in an awful fashion for her own constitu- . lional gayety.  At length an exclamation of"There it is Pt,'from Melanie, announced the appearance of th.. boat, some two or three miles below, M far as the fort commanded the view. -. a quarter of an hour it was waking the echo of the    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6851-00000015"/> a 28     BLONDE AND 'BRUNEFTTE. :ills behind the battery, (which hills in truth com- manded Red Fort so as-to- make it useless in mod- er warfare,) and in ten minutes more had de- posited a number of passengers, by means of a boat, at the wharf of the village above. As the boat passed, some handkerchiefs were waved, to which the two girls replied by signalling with their own, and then Xanthine proposed, and Melanie agreed, to walk down the road, to meet the friends whom -they expected. I, II ;- .-.    CHAPTER IV. THE HEROES ARERINTRODUCED AT ONCE. A NUMBER of gentlemen, one of whom carried a carpet-bag, and followed by a boy carrying an- other, came up the winding road, and to them ad- vanced eagerly Melanie and Xanthine-that is, the Misses Blake. These two charming girls, all bonnet- less as they were, quickened their gait into almost a run, as they drew near, as if to contend which should first fling herself into her father's arms or secure the first paternal kiss. Next they had to shake hands cordially with two brothers, and then they seemed to bCo ;o aware of the presence of a couple of strange riwhom their father intro- duced them, and whoi h they greeted with gentle maidenly inclinations of the head, to which the livelier Xanthine added a word of welcome toe Red Fort.  As every practised reader of stories sees at once    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6851-00000016"/> 30 -    BLOi DE AND BRUNETTB that thesestranger gentlemen were the fates of the young ladies, we shall not vainly-attempt to con- ceithe fact, but proceed candidly to tell who they were and what they were like, in such a style as the importance of the occasion demand ^ The younger, taller, better-looking, best-dressed, and more distinguished of the two, was named Thomas McAboy Tremaine, Esquire. His figure was indeed remarkably fine, and was shown to great advantage in his Gothamite summer attire, of spotless white pants falling neatly over patent- leather gaiters, a waistcoat of like snowy gleam, relieved by gold buttons, a chain and various trin- kets dangling over it, linen perfect, a cravat tie of a delicate silk check, a dark green cut-away coat with loose sleeves, and a superb white hat. We should not, however, omit, though we had- nearly forgotten, the straw-colored gloves, (wonderfully small for a man,) and the slender cane, mounted with a deer's head in ivory. As for the features of Mr. Tremaine, they were of that description which- is almost peculiar E:e the Gothamite aris- tocracy, no matter from what European stock they sping; and which will one day, perhaps, be as fa' moS::as the beauty that, through endless changes Ooaee, stingers around the shores of the AEgean. But Tremaine was more than ordinarily handsome   THE HRIRO SARE INTRODUCED.    31 in that same rici, yet classic style; his woa beauty to strike, asAthe admiring glances of the whole femi- nine half of the celebrated promenade of Blooming- Way in Gotham attested. And besides the glow of Tituaque color, and the harmony of noble features, Mr. Tremaine, the girls said,-had "such beautiful hair," and such "pets" of silky mous- taches, which, by the by, were pretty much all the beard he yet could boast, and were made much of in consequence by their owner, whose years did not exceed two or three and twenty. Mr. Tremaine's companion was of different mould, shorter, more thick-set. His dress was vastly plainer, some might have said it was in bet- ter taste. Shooting-jacket, waistcoat, trowsers and gaiters were all of the same small-checked pattern, called, I believe, shepherd's tartan. His shoes were heavy, as if made for tramping, and covered a large, or at least, substantial foot, fit to sustain a manly weight, A large gray " wide awake" cov- ered his head. He wore it a little on one side, which showed a fai hit, broad and high fore- head, and a physiogomy beneath; that nobody would have called handsome, and yet it arrested attention. An aquiline nose -twas his best single feature,-a piercing dark eye, full of fire, high cheek-bones, a large but kindly mouth a massive,    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6851-00000017"/> L :LNDE An B"R AUBI . resolute n hair black and  , a complexion sunburnt and embrowned, with a touch of bright florid color in the cheeks, like a russet apple checked with red, a heavy black beard, cl6osel - ven, ex- cept the large careless whiskers, adx whole head and face rather squarish and masi , Ware his list of attractions. The expression of this gentle- man's face was pleasing, his manner was diffident and modest to the ladies. It was he who carried -his carpet-bag, or rather valise, in hand; he had also his gun on his shoulder, and a small black pointer went at his heels. He was introduced as Mr. Donald McAboy, a cousin of Mr. Tremaine, and an artist. A young Guernseyman, picked up at the steamboat landing, bore, as I have implied, Mr. Tremaine's travelling equipment, together with his gun and other accoutrements of a sportsman. It may be well to state that neither of these two gentlemen whom I have thus introduced to the reader, when they accepted old Blake's invi- tation to pass the night at his country house, with a view of shooting over the hills the next day on their way to the wilder regions lying beyond, had the least idea of making love to his daughters, or indeed knew that he had any. They were ac- quaintances of Harry Blake, who was something of a fast youth, and drove a tandem, to his father' ^  ^O-   THE HE-ROES -,ARB- INTROtCED O .

AFTER the usual courtesies, the party thus aug- mented, went on chatting and laughing towards the house. They entered the grounds by a white carriage-gate, and came to the front of the house, that looked to the hills. Here was another veran- dah, where they found Mrs. Blake sitting, in the cool of a day that had been oppressive. She was a well-preserved lady of fifty, having aeculiarly arch miling face, surrounded by a gayly be-rib- boned cap, as before mentioned when we saw her re the steamboat. She gstrteo d a little at Mr. Treiagnes name, and gave rim, asf thel  his friend, a quite decided stare. She was not alone, however, and so we are obliged to present another personage of our tale, a gentleman not much older toal appearances than Mr. McAboy, but who might c asily be recognized by various signs as an ecclesiastic. - Father Rowman, as Mrs. Blake called '^   MADAM BLAKE AND HER CO3FESSO R.  35 him, was a person of elegant nerior-!:handsome as Tremaine himself, and in his scrupulously plain black dress, without a particle of white showing except his ,;collar, had an air as distinguished,to say the vey least, as that glittering dandy. Father Rowman-was remarkably courteous in his manners too, and indeed, his thorough oldworld polish and adroitness, and perfect dignity withal, threw both the young Americans completely into the shade. Sentiment beamed in his dark eyes; his language was colored by a delicate and scholarly taste; the very tones of his voice, deep, manly, and vibrating, conveyed a subtle pleasure to the hearer; and per- haps the total effect was not the less captivating, for a certain sang fjroid, approaching to apathy, which pervaded his manner in spite of these win- ning qualities, and which might be due. either to constitutional indifference or to a singular self-con- trol. At the outside Father Rowman did not ex- ceed thirty, and a careless glance would scarcely have ascribed so many summers and autumns to those glossy raven locks and that cheek of dark, healthful bloom.    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6851-00000019"/> CHAPTER VL YO U N G GOTHAM.

The showy beauty and fashionable elegance of Tom Tremaine had fascinated the simple regard of the inexperienced Xanthine, while the artistic enthu- siasm, the animated conversation, and manliness of aspect that distinguished McAboy, had interested :Melanie no less deeply. But it was a moral pecu- liarity that riveted the charm in either case..

Father Rowman. Conjecturing that this was the confessor of the fam- ily, his fancy already conjured up a little romance-- an opposition, a struggle--that gave the affair a new zest. He had not yet an idea that any thing definite would come of it; it was a dream, such as he had read of before; but yet he gave himself up to it with an artist's, carelessness, as Tremaine, to his disgust, seemed likely to do with a fortune- hunter's cool premeditation. So poor a conception had either of them of the sacredness of the stake for which they played, concerning, as it did, the most important of earthly relations, guarded as it was, by a mystery of divine insflution, and bear- ing within it the interests of many future immor. tals. The young men met the family again at break- fast, but there was no good excuse for prolonging their stay much after that, as Mr. Blake and his sons returned to the city to attend to business, their annual period of recreation not having yet arrived, although it was near. The best the visitors could do was to take leave for the present, and trust to the chapter of accidents for a future meet- ing. And yet, perhaps, this necessity of parting served their turn better than opportunities, had they been afforded, of further intimacy.

When Father Rowman took leave, (after the Syoung men were gone,) he brought a blush to the Grheek of both the sisters, by advising them half gayly, half seriously, not to be taken too much with the bright plumage, or (glancing at Melanie) even the sweet song, of any strange bird that chanced to alight on their garden paling, or to sing for an hour in the trees about the lawn, but to ask themselves whether it was a mate for them- "nestlings, " said he, significantly, "as you are, of Holy Mother Church!"And when he was gone, Melanie and Xanthine walked together in the grounds, very sad and silent, hardly looking each other in the face, but sometimes breathing out a sigh which they had no need to interpret. t         *       "  ' i   CHAPTER VIII. HOW A FIRE, ONCE KINDED, GROWS OF ITSEL4F4 WHEN IT FINDS PLENTY OF INFLAMMABLE MA- TERIAL. TEIS was the first sorrow of a serious kind that Melanie and Xanthine had ever experienced-a pleasant, desirable thing which they were not per- mitted to have. Nay, it was more than that, for where the affections are concerned, people will fancy that their very being is wrapped up in the thing desired. The sisters had ways of communi- cating their sentiments to each other, without vio- lating delicacy by any crude confidence,and in this manner they fed their mutual flame. By degrees, talking always by way of supposition, they got to discuss the thing morse frankly. The abstract ques- tion whether or not they ought to love or marry persons of a different faith from their own they often debated. There was the ready-athand exam- ple of their father. He had wedded a  what- ever you choose to call the faith of the Yengeese nations--a egative, say (the Gothamites called Xega. fle    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6851-00000025"/> *8S     BLONDE AMND, BKR1rE. it so-every one in Gotham' who desired to be thought well of, professed the tenets of the Nega- tive' faith);--and their mother, besides bringing into the world so many children of the true church, (as Melanie and Xanthine of course considered it,) was herself gathered into, its fold, and would be saved (said Xanthine innocently) in consequence ; fthat marriage, from eternal perdition. Surely this was a good. Why should not similar happy effects follow a similar union on the part of the children themselves with other Negatives? If ev- ery true believer should marry a Negative, and every Negative so married became a Positive, with- all the offspring of such a wedlock, in time the whole Negational Church would be swallowed up by the Positive one, as a certain famous warrior proposed to defeat the enemy's army, fifty by fifty in detail, until they were all destroyed. Our fair propagandists, in concerting this beautiful plan of naking conquests for the "true faith " with the bow and arrows of the fabulous god Cupid, by, causing its enemies to pass under the flowery yoke of hymen, forgot the possibility that the " true be- liever " in such cases might yield as well as the other party, as the valiant captaini above mentioned forgot to reckon the possibility that the enemy mightkill him.   BKNDLLNGS.  In the conversations of Melanie and Xanthine on these topics, they would by no means always argue, however, on the same side, but sometimes Melanie and sometimes Xanthine would take the opposite part, and indeed it happened generally that if Xanthine pleaded too warmly the cause- of Nature, Melanie would take up that of Faith, bu-  less warmly; and if Melanie, on the other hand, vindicated the claims of the heart, and protested the impossibility of accounting for or resisting the mysterious power of sympathy, then Xanthine would ingeniously point out that a parity of reason- ing would justify every criminal, every unwise and imprudent attachment and connection. Then this aspect of the case being at last turned over and looked at till they were weary of it, from the ab-. stract they came down to the practical question, and Melanie was the first, ,o- urge that it might be impossible for them, and certainly it was impossible for all Positive girls to find Positive husbands. Now in their own case, they were acquainted (as Xanthine knew) with scarce any Positive fam-' ilies, and among those were there any young men who would ever think of them, or whom they would ever think of marrying?-"Either," said she, "they are rude and uncultivated, and so we should not like them, if they liked us; or else they 3     <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6851-00000026"/> BLONDE AND BRUNETE. are ambitious and fond of the world, and hardly choose to be considered Positives at all, and are seeking to marry young ladies of Negative parent- age, for the sake of the fashionable connection and eclat it gives them." Then Xanthine, who was a little piqued at the idea that she was left on the -bush, in any sense, or by anybody, reminded her sister of two or three beaux she had, of the true faith and Celtic lineage. "Aye!" replied Melanie, '" they know that pa is rich, and your money is their object much more than yourself, Xanthine." "Why, then," retorted Xanthine, "do they not address themselves to you, who will have at least as great a share of pa's money as I shall have?" "Perhaps they perceive that I see through them and that you don't," replied the older sister, with a deep flush, for nther, did she relish being told that she was ove oked, however untrue it was. "Well," cried Xanthine, "it shall never be said that I married a Negative because no Positive would have me." "And I am not willing it should be said of me," cried Melanie, warmly, "that I married a Nega- tive because I never saw a Positive that I would like to have."   VERY NATURAL. 5Ai. Nay," replied Xanthine, coloring up in turn at the implied disparagement of her own admirers and perhaps favorites once, "I am sure that Wil- liam McDonough, and Frank Kavanagh, and Char- ley Lynch are not to be despised. And there is Leary Mortimer. He is one of the most elegant young men in Gotham; everybody says so." "But he doesn't visit in our family," answers Melanie, "and you know he never came near us the whole winter after we met him at the Ballston Springs, though he waltzed with you, dear, every evening at the Grand Gotham Hotel, and helped ma and me to the water every morning at the Chalybeate. I know who was dreadfully smitten with him from that time till he cut us in the Bloom- ing-way, where he was walking with the beautiful Miss Belle Randolph-you remember that, don't you, Xanthe?"    X "Yes, I remember it," aid Xanthine, bursting into tears at the mortifying recollection, "but it isn't kind of you, dear, to twit me with it.' Melanie and Xanthine soon made up this little spat," as the latter laughingly called it, and it ended, as such always did, with kisses, and apolo gies, and mutual .pardons. But the affair of the heart crept on all this while, by sunshine, by mist, by showers, and wind and stormy weather, all invit-    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6851-00000027"/> 52     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. ing or misleading, or blowing the fair inexperienced mariners towards the rocks and the lee-shore. It is true that they knew very well it was none of their business to occupy their thoughts about some young strangers, acquaintance of a night and morning, whom they might never see again. They had their principles and their prayer-books to warn them, and their mother's sensible advice, in the ab- stract, as a guide to a more prudent use of their time and their sensibilities. They might also have considered (had they been wise) that the history of the youthful heart is, for the most part, a history of foolish, inordinate desires, that never can have any result but to agitate and fever the mind for the time that they last. And Melanie and Xan- thine never confessed to each other that they cared seriously for the absent Tremaine and his cousin. Even Xanthine, who had ever before been inju- diciously confidential, and foolishy frank, in such matters, kept steadily to the protestation that she was really heart-whole now, but as there was never a minute since she was fifteen that she had not been "in love" with somebody, this claim to be suddenly free from all tender fancies was a very suspicious circumstance. But Melanie, who had ever been so reserved in regard to her own feelings, was a little more open. She allowed that she had   A PLAN FOR DONALD.      53 never seen any one who pleased her more at first sight than Donald McAboy. He was a man of genius, and it was in that character that she ad- mired him. She only did wish very much that he was of the true faith, not only for his sou's sake, (that of course,) but because he might then paint such beautiful pictures for churches, and no other religion would ever give scope to his splendid powers. When Xanthine, with simplicity, asked what pictures of Donald's her sister had seen, Me- lanie was forced to confess that she had never seen any, but she remembered very well to have read a criticism on one in the Ladies' Weekly Diurnal, in which it was compared to Raphael and Titian. To be sure the Diurnal gave the preference to the latter, but how could any young Gothamite artist be expected to equal the old masters? It is quite likely, though, that all these fond girlish dreams would have passed off in time, as the unreasonable, imperious wishes of children do for some plaything that is bitterly cried for and speed. ily forgotten, had not a new incident occurred, which we shall relate presently.    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6851-00000028"/> CHAPTER IX. THE EXCURSION. DONAL NICABOY hinted that Mr. ;Blake might be worth halfa million, and he meanfit for a mod- erate guess. But people's fortunes are almost always overrated. Mr. Blake was not worth half a million, nor within a hundred thousand of that amount. It takes a long time for a man to acquire five hundred thousand clear, by fair, honest, regular gains, unless he has a great run of luck, as it is called, (though there's no such thing as luck,) or a special genius for commercial pursuits. Old Blake, as the young men irreverently termed him, had merely fair talents that way, and great prudence joined to industry. And his integrity in busi- ness was really exact, and this made his profits smaller, at the same time that it limited his opera- tions. Strict, minute, conscientious integrity, in small things as in great, is a costly article. If you   THE EXCURSION.       55 would have it, and the approbation of conscience and the favor of God, which go with it, you must pay for it. Honesty is the best policy, no doubt, all things considered, and in the long run, or tak- ing a great number of cases together; but if your object is to get very rich, very rapidly, honesty will stand in your way, to a certainty. Nine rogues out of ten, it is true, will be ruined and disgraced; but the tenth will be richer than the honest man. Mr. Blake was a " warm"' man, as the phrase is in the old country that he came from. But he had uses for all iis money. Part was invested in his business, a part in land, mortgages, stocks, city lots, railway shares, State bonds, &amp;c., and of these some were productive, others not. He was liberal, but he could not always put his hand in his pocket and take out gold and bills, or sit down and write checks ad libitum, whenever a call was made (and they were made pretty often) upon his zeal and his charity. It is astonishing how much money the true religion requires for its support and propaga- tion. Faith is even costher than honesty, and charity is more expensive than both. The poor and the Church are never satisfied, and the more you give the more you may. It was so from the beginning, and He who knows what dross gold is, and who paid His own temple-tribute easily from a fish's mouth, has so ordained it. f    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6851-00000029"/> 58f     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. Old Blake was a liberal fellow, I allow, but: e might have been more liberal without hurting either his own eternal interests or those of4 fam- ily, or perhaps their temporal interests either. Father Rowman had purchased in the city of Gotham, from a congregation of Negatives, (going into finer quarters,) a church to accommodate a neighborhood swarming with poor Positives; and it is needless to add that he went deeply in debt fort, and for a thousand and one necessary things therewith ci :nected. A considerable part of this had been pf:off by subscriptions, (Ntriek Blake, Esq., gave $1,000, with a "princely munificence,' as Father Rowman judiciously observed,) and what remained seemed fairly the part of posterity, which will certainly be better able to pay it than the pre- sent generation is. One thing more (there is always   ing more) was, however, Cutely essentii. They had an organ, (or the use f one,) vestments, an altar-lamp, an ostensorium-expen- sive peculiarities of Positivity-they needed now a house for the pastor, and it was proposed that this should be got b/ the efficacious intervention of the ladies, who are always the most zealous Positives going. The ladies had had a Fair for the object, but did not realize sufficient, and so it was thought best to have recourse to an "Excursion."   THE EXCURSION.  The idea of this affair was to procure a steam- boat, (Messrs. Screw and Paddleton, the proprietors of th4ld Hendrick line, although Negatives, gave the use of one of their magnificent boats for nothing,) and to convey as many people as could be persuaded to buy tickets, up the river, an hour or two's sail, to land at some beautifill spot where refreshments would be provided, to have a picnic, dance, &amp;c., and so return to Gotham in the evening. One motive of Father Rowman's visit the day we found him at Red Fort, was to^ ange with Mrs. Blakesome of the details of thi rject, and it was then and there settled-for it was not in Positive womankind to resist Father Rowman-- that the Blakes would give their beautiful grounds, with the lawn, the garden, the orchard, the grove behind the house, and the picturesque old fort it- self, f he use of the excursionists, a eially for the picnic. It was a very disagreea bandon- ment of the privacy and as it were sacred seclusion of their domain, besides the injury to the grass and flowers, the littering of the walks, and a thousand inconveniences more, but they made the sacrifice willingly, for the sake of the popular and pious pere, and to secure the object. But this was not all. The Blakes would be obliged to entertain some of the managers, for at 3*    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6851-00000030"/> 58 '   BLONDE AND BRUIETTE. least a day before, and Mrs. Blake with her daugh ters and their servants would be busy enough in cutting and spreading bread-and-butter andsasand- wiches, mixing lemonade, currant-shrub, and what not, freezing ice-cream, preparing coffee, cake, &amp;c., &amp;c., besides cold chicken, pastry, marmalade, and every other appropriate edible, for nearly a thou- sand hungry excursionists. A good many good ladies-zealous for Pere Rowman and Positivity, sent hams already- boiled; other some, sugar by the whole loaf; -a grocer (Mr. Michael Green-he de- serves mention by name, and indeed suggested to me not to forget it) contributed cheese for the whole company expected; McDonough and Lynch gave the coffee and lemons-a bag of one and a box of the other; and Champagne and Xeres-the great foreign wine merchants-particular friends of Fath- er Rowm::-made the munificent donation of six dozen of claret and sherry for cobblers. -it had been agreed to have no wine or intoxicating bever- age, but this gift overruled that part of the pro- gramme.. As all refreshments were to be paid for extra, it was thought that a very handsome sum would be netted. The appointed day arrived, and the weather could not have been more auspicious.

There are always delays in these affairs, and it was nearly one o'clock (instead of twelve, as the pro- gramme advised) when the steamboat City of Gotham, in all the magnificence of white paint and decorated paddle-boxes and with innumerable flags streaming over it, the decks crowded with people of all ages and both sexes in their holiday attire, a band of music playing patriotic airs, came out above the Arrowheads, and made its triumphant appearance in the Kappawn Zee, as that great bay of the Hendrick was- called on which Red Fort was situate.* Chief among the national banners displayed upon the masts and flag-poles of the City of. Goth- am was, of course, the flag of the great Columbian Confederacy-gold stars upon a blue field, indicat- ing the sister sovereignties of which althe world knows it is composed, and a certain number of crimson and snow-white bands that signified the corresponding number of the patriotic colonies by whom its independence was first achieved.

As soon as the steamer came in sight cf those who were expecting her on the walls of th fort, a cannon, borrowed from an artillery company for the occasion, awoke the echoes with the first gun of a national salute, to which the people on the City of Gothan, as it sailed majestically by, - - were obliged for want of a gun, to answer by re- peated cheers, and waving of hats and handker- chiefs, which had a most animating effect. It was really a pretty sight, when the steam- boat was at last laid alongside of her wharf, to see the company on board coming off, in a solid col- umn almost, across the wide plank, and then ad- vancing up the shady road towards Red Fort. The old battery was never more formidably attack- ed, and we may add, never worse defended. The great white gate was wide open to the invaders, who in a short time gained possession of the lawn and piazza, the garden and the fort itself, the trel- lised arcade, the gra:ied'walks, and the soft, tempt- ing elm-shaded grass. Benches and chairs were placed in great number, but not enough for so great a company, and happy were those who could secure good seats, especially the ladies with young families,   THE EXCURSION.      .61 and mothers with infants, of whom there were not a few, intermingled with the youth, while of the latter every lad perhaps had a sweetheart with him, in act or in expectancy, and every girl her beau. By more than one loving couple was the impor- tant day fixed on this very excursion, and by many others, it is likely, were exchanged the first inno- cent vows. For innocent, at least apparently, and in outward behavior, all were, and not more happy than good. Many young men could be seen in that crowd, whose countenances were marked with as pure a bloom as the maidens themselves whom they escorted; manly, healthful faces too, sun- burnt sometimes, but quite devoid of that hard, yet effeminate and corrupt expression, which toc often is seen in the youth of a metropolis. The young females displayed a great deal of the same kind of beauty, which touches the heart more than the senses, and in a considerable number it was unit- ed with features of the most refined cast, to which dark eyes and hair, joined and contrasted with com- plexions of rosy bloom or snowy fairness, gave a nationality of style that coui ot be mistaken for a moment. Some wandered along the beach, picking up the pebbles, worn to smoothest roundness by the tides of the Hendrick; and even tiny, thin shells    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6851-00000032"/> 62     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE.  , weinot wanting to reward the diligent curiosity of others. Some clambered to the topmost wall of the fort, for the view: some strolled through the garden, admiring the flowers and "hooking" the currants, or coveting the blooming plums and gummy peaches. Others found their way into the orchard where the ground was strewn with apples, some of them sufficiently hard and green-they ate them all the same. One joyous party seized upon the swing attached to the branches of the mighty old elm on the lawn-the scup they called it. Now, it was a couple of young men who stood on the swing-seat, and by squatting as it descended and rising quickly as it rose, imparted to it soon a fearfully rapid motion, carrying them like light- ning now down with a rush, now up with a flirt and fling among the green boughs. Then it was a whole nest of children, laIghing and screaming, whom a couple of good-natured youths swung to and fro, bidding them "not to fear and hol on ter the scup." Now it-was a shy, yet delighted damsel, with her flowing robscarefully tucked about her feet, whom a rude, d brother, or eager, happy "swain," caused to vibrate "between heaven and earth ' in the safe though dizzy seat. On the benches and chairs around the lawn were graver, but not less contented groups, elderly or middle-aged-peo-   THE EXCURSION.       63 pie, with young children tumbling upon the!tlick sward at their feet. And here and there (if-we may be pardoned the mention of it) a mother of primitive ideas quieted a still younger member of her family by giving it the breast. The younger portion already began to demand the edibles, and the refreshment tables, spread under a vast awning, gathered the greatest crowd. Goodness! what a demand for sandwiches and oysters! How busy are the ladies that help to lemonade and sangaree! How assiduous must those young ladies be that preside in white dresses and bare red arms at the coffee urns!-they are zealous friends of Father Rowman, and fully conscious of the dignity of their office on this occasion. But that young man -'tis gay George Dillon-who "does" the cob. blers, how expert, how showy, how active he is! Small harm will those well-iced tumblers do to those who imbibe them, or their contents, if you please: --'tis ice and water and red, red claret, and scarce a flavor besides, the which George adds surrep- titiously, for Father RownmSforbade it strictly.

But then Patrick Blake, Esquire, has a sideboard in the dining-room of the villa, inaccessible to the    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6851-00000033"/> "     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. prV^ u vulgar, where the good Father and a few other select friends may indemnify themselves, if they like, for this abnegation. Most of the excursionists made a serious meal, as indeed they needed it at the hour it was. After that the dancing began. The interior of the fort had been boarded over and covered in with an awn- ing like a huge tent, and adorned with flags and evergreens. A fine military band, kindly lent for the occasion by the commandant of the garrison of Fort Gotham, the principal defence of the city, played co- tillons and other fashionable dances. This, of course, was the principal thing that the young people came for, and surely, as Father Rowman sensibly ob- served, there was "no harm in enjoying themselves and helping the Church at the same time." 'Twas the order of the day at all events, and for my part, although my dancing days were over, I confess to have received a great deal of pleasure from wit- nessing the agreeable scene of youthful gaiety. The flower must wither and fall from its stem, scentless and discolored, but in its bloom how sweet is its fragrance, how delicate its bem1tty!

Laughter and pleasure are indeed in a sense more tragic and awful than tears and sadness, as the smooth swiftness of the river above the cataract is more fearful than its foam and dark eddies are below. It is needless to say that Xanthine and Melanie were among the most conspicuous as well of the manageresses of the pic-nic, as of the active par- ticipants of the bal, as one young lady rather af- fectedly called it. It is true that Xanthine made herself merry in private with the want of elegance on the part of her beaux, but for all that she con- trived to enjoy herself with them extremely well. It might be that Melanie, who laughed less and was a great deal more courteous, had more real contempt in her heart for those who; had enjoyed inferior advantages. The young men present were indeed all deficient in some point of breeding or appearance, to an eye that judged from the stand. point of Gothamite fashionable dife, but I must say that many of the young ladies were full as pleas- ing, to my taste, as the Misses Blake. In several instances where the brothers of a family were rude and gawky, the sisters were refined and graceful.    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6851-00000034"/> (8 -  BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. Itv  ::d have been quite impossible to determine the social position of many a tastefully attired and perhaps beautiful dancer in the cotillons, but for the vulgar style of her partner, and an intimacy between them that showed he was her affianced as well. Why not, Miss Xanthine? Why not, Miss Melanie? Possibly even you could pick out a pair of worthier husbands among this honest company, and who would make you happier women in the long run, and with whom you would live better Christians and be surer (according to your creed) of going to Heaven with them at last, than you will with those magnificent gents who are just this moment working their way toward you through the heated and perspiring throng that somehow al- ways clogs up the entrance way between the old fort and the gardens. Thomas Tremaine, Esq., and Donald McAboy, artist, in gra" toog for a country pic-nic and dance, availed themslves of the public occasion (of which they somehow had heard), to pay a visit to the hospitable mansion of the Blakes, and renew their acquaintance with "old Blake's" daughters. The joyous Xanthine blushes with exuluing pride, and the proud Melanie turns a little pale, as she re- ceives their salutations.   CHAPTER X. AN ANGLER OF SKILL. I REALLY think that Patrick Blake, Esquire, would have made a good thing of it. by giving Father Rowman a cheque for the whole amount he expected to realize by this excursion, and en- gaging him to give up the plan for the present, or at least not to ask the use of his villa on the oc- casion. I do not allude hereto to the trampling down of the beautiful velvety lawn and the nicely gravelled walks, and even of the softiamy flower- beds, nor to the loss of fruit, the injury to the shrubbery, the theft of flowers, (by some rude youngsters who deemed it a good practical joke,) and the general profanation and disordering of the sweet, home-like, rural place, which must ever after seem like a suburban Sunday resort. But if there had been no excursion, tickets for the same would not have been sold in the neighboring vil-    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6851-00000035"/> 68     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. lage Kof Kappawn, and Messrs. Tremaine and M3 Aboy, returning from their sporting expedition, would not have bought any, and thus would not have obtained a legitimate pretext for a visit, and if they had ventured to come, it would have been an intrusion, and the good father and mother would have been put on their guard, and the young ladies would have been warned in time, or other effectual measures might have been taken to counteract the manceuvres of the enemy. In the midst of so much confusion there was no oppotunity for watch- fulness, none for kind paternal interference, none for sweet maternal oversight baffling frivolous gal- lantries. And it is unfortunate that in such scenes qualities tell and win a way for their possessor, on which a serious and wise character would be the last to rely. For instance, Tremaie, who was master of no single accomplishment besides, was almost a pei dancer, and that not merely in a vulgar wa   er of the steps and the bare action of dancing, bUt of all the collateral agremens, such as how to entertain his partner with pleasant small- talk, how to lead her gracefully to her place when she needed repose, how to provide her with a seat, when all seats seemed occupied, (no one was ever more adroit in this,) and to bring or secure, with- out hurry and without delay, the desired refresh-   AN ANGLER OF SKIL.

The little arts of che ball-room, in short, he carried to perfection, and the result'was a finished pleasure in having him for a partner, a pleasure made up of infinite small details, but in its general effect very striking and simple. He gave his mind to it, and he succeeded. He was undeniably su- perior in that field, and superiority in any thing tells in its time. Miss Xanthine Blake thought and said that she had never seen such an " elegant man," and the loftier elanie acknowledged that every- body else appeared to great disadvantage in com- parison "in such a scene." Meanwhile Donald McAboy atoned for all deficiencies of social elegance by the earnest language of a manly lover, which the solitude of a crowd, and the brief nature of the opportunity, allowed him to use; for being a bold fellow"by nature, and emulous, he was not disposed to let Tremaine get ahead of him. Here- in he was like a fisherman acquai' ih the re- sorts and habits of the finny tribep : proaches a shady pool in a flowing mountain-stream, over- shadowed by rocks, or where an old log lies buried beneath the surface, and casts dexterously a well-chosen fly just where a slight ripple breaks up the mirror. Instantly a noble trout, with the velocity of lightning, darts to the surface--" rises" at the mimic insect-and by the very perfec-    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6851-00000036"/> 70     BLONDE AND BRUNETIE. tion and brilliancy of its native spring upon its prey, is caugt and becomes a prey to a wilier foe. ( This simile holds pretty well of Melanie Blake. As a woman, true love was her natural food, and though the shyest of all living creatures where she had the least reason to suspect a wile, yet none would dart so suddenly, and with such thoughtless vehemence, upon a bait that really deceived her, as this did. The hook in this care was taken as soon as offered. Off, indeed, the beautiful swift native of this still deep cove was, like lightning, but she carried the hook in her mouth, and the fine, strong line followed; it was only an affair of time and skill, but more patience, to bring in and fairly " basket" the prize.

Candidly he confesstlthat he had only his profession and his wealthy donnexions, yet already his income was sufficient to marry on, if she-if "Melanie"-were willing to share the lot of an artist. Then Melanie listened again. This was the sort of scene her imagination (dan- gerous faculty ) had painted. In short, when the dance broke up--at the sound of the bell of the City of Gotham, enforced by the piercing thunder of her steam pipe, and the tired excursionists were seen hurrying down the shady road from all points, to secure seats on the favorite hurricane deck, whence the beautiful scenery might be best enjoyed as they slipped down the river, as it behooved Tre- maine McAboy to go on the boat for various rea- sons, they mifed with the retiring crowd, and mak- ing a pretext of wishing to bid good-bye to some friends, both Melanie and Xanthine-ked as far as the great white-gate with themS :Aeerwards when the City of Gotham, with her thronged decks and streaming banners, passed under the one gun of the ancient fort, the sisters were on the wall, and answered their friends by waving their hand- kerchiefs, and the saucy Xanthine blew a kiss from her hand to whomsoever she meant it for, but the     <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6851-00000037"/> proud Melanie, reproving her sharply, only watched oud Melanie, reproving the boat as iong as it was in sight, and waved her handkerohief, it might be to five hundred that re- plied, or it might be to only one.   CHAPTER XI. A BASKET OF GAME McABOY and Tremaine left with the servants of Mr. Blake a very choice present of such game as was then in season, the fruit of their sport in the mountains, together with a splendid mess of trout. The latter were served that evening for supper, and caused Mr. Blake to express the wish that he had invited the young gentlemen to spend the night at his house. This timely gift, and the gen- tleman-like manner fhilch it had been offered, produced a highIly iorable impression on the papa and mamma of Xanthine and Melanie, but Father Rpwman smilingly observed that the young gentlemen understood their o;i nterest very well.

They were looking forward to the-return of the family to town in the Fall, and to that hiemal intercourse of sleigh-rides, play-going, balls and parties, which so frequently leads to hy- meneal engagements in the Spring. Whe :   sisters came to compare notes with each ot   the days that followed the Excursion and the flying visit of their friends, it appeared that Tremaine had not made (indeed how abrupt and presumptuous it would have been!) any declaration of attachment to Xanthine of which she could take notice, although his manner and expressions had left her perfectly certain, as she said, of his "intentions." But having exposed herself to a little ridicule in the case of Leary Mortimer, by allowing expectations of that kind to transpire, which afterwards were not reaed, she bound Me- lanie to strict secrecy, pleadigthat it would be time enough to inform their are of such pre- tensions when they were fo rml unequivocally made.

So time passed on, and time is necessary to ripen every sentiment. The slight uncertainty in Xanthine's mind whether her elegant lover were serious, was the very thing. to ripen hers; while the interest of Melanie in Donald McAboy was kept vividly alive by the interior discussion of the question whether her reserve and coyness would damp or inflame his apparent ardor. She remem- bered every word that had escaped him, and glad she was (proud girl!) that no sign had been given on her part from which a modest man could infer any thing in his own favor. That Donald was a genius she was certain. She had succeeded in finding the paper-the "Ladies' Weekly Diurnal" -in which his pictures were criticized, and the editor confessed, that -:Mri MCABoY had a "rare gift ;" he was "a rich and effective colorist," a "vig- orous and accurate draughtsman," and that his "designs breathed of poeticalinspiration." These phrases Melanie got by heart, and all that Donald had said to her in the old fort, or beneath the tent on the lawn, was associated with the hero, who already was the subject, inprint, of such admirable expressions.    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6851-00000040"/> 78     1iADB E AND BRUNETTE.

THE McAboys were a family so interesting that I deem it my duty to give some account of them in this place, especially as they exercised a great influence upon the fate and happiness of my prin- cipal characters. They were descended from the McAboys of Mull, a very ancient sept in the north of Caledonia, and as they were all genflemen, rom the chief to the meanest clansman, old McAboy, the grandfather of Donald, was a gentleman of course, being about the fortieth cousin of the reign-: :?, ing chief, who about that period expelled his k'i-- i folk from their mountain cottages to turn the r-ai and hills of Mull into sheep-walks. Exiled, in coi-it sequence, to the New World, Angus McAboy became first the factor of a tobacco planter in Dominia, (as the greatest commonwealth of the Columbian confederacy was called,) and afterwards,    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6851-00000042"/> 82     BLOiTND AND B]DRUNETeE. entering into the general business in Gotham, ac- cumulated in the course of years an immense for- tune which he bequeathed to his children. All these (it was rather curious) to a certain share of the paternal traits of close calculation and worldly sense, united a remarkable love for some ideal ob- ject, in the pursuit of which (whatever it was) they sacrificed worldly considerations. Thus Miss Me Aboy, the only daughter, ran away, as I have said, with Tremaine's father, who had no fortune of his own and soon ran through hers. James, the eldest of the sons, never married and husbanded his prop- erty. But he built himself a house on Temple Avenue, in Gotham, with battlements on the roof and stone-mullioned windows, (it was some de- graded form of the castellated architecture of the middle ages,) and had in, it a library stored with vellum manuscripts and rare editions, on which he spent a mint of money, and a gallery of exquisite pictures, procured at a like cost, neither of which he would let anybody see, but his own most inti- mate friends. And when a church of the sort which he believed in as a Caledonian, was built just opposite his house, he gave an enormous sum to have the exterior in the same style of architec- ture; and accordingly, with its pointed windows, and buttresses, and its dark frowning tower clothed   A, SNUFF-COLORED TARTAN.    8S in appropriately sown creepers, to resemble ivy, it was the pride of that beautiful quarter of Gotham. Another brother, Angus, was a great philanthropist, and was known for the slaves that he ransomed and his immense subscriptions to charitable ob- jects. Every year he patronized one selected charity, and gave all he could spare to that, the effect of which was that the widow and the orphan sometimes went empty from his door, while the whole world yet resounded with his last act of an- nual liberality. Angus was married, and had a large family, whom he pinched, although upon the whole they made a considerable display, and were ranked among the first families in Gotham. The third brother, Walter, was the only one who dilap- idated his own fortune, which he did to a consid- erable extent soon after he came in possession of it, by a passion he had for supporting the character of a Caledonian Laird among the nobles of the Old World. It was quite in vain, since everybody  knew, or tound out directly, that he was the son of a tobacconist, whose canisters of snuff, indeed, had a far wider fame than the Castle of Mull, or the free- booting exploits of the ancient McAboys; but the aristocrats were willing to take his m6ney, or win it from him at play, and in that manner,- and by the extravagant style of living he adoptedi he in    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6851-00000043"/> i84     BRUNETTE AND -BLONDE. a few years spent all but about one-fifth, which he had prudently reserved. With this remainder, still bent onnobility, he married a German baroness, a widow with several children, and many years older than himself, and in spite of the sneers of his court- ly companions, when it became necessary for him, according to the wise usages of that country, to prove his pedigree in order to form this connec- tion, he was able to show his sixteen unexception- able quarterings to the entire satisfaction of the herald's college of the little duchy of Saxe-Kleinen- gen, to which his future spouse belonged. This lady brought him one son, our friend Donald, and to her (such was his attachment to her) he left, at his death, all that remained of his once fine fortune. It is true that she would not marry him till it had been legally settled upon her, and she prized so much this mark of her husband's love, that she showed every inclination to keep it forever; but she sent his son, willingly, at the age of ten, to his uncle James, to be educated at the latter's expense, continuing herself to reside at Kleinengen, where her income enabled her to make a very pretty figure among the dowagers of the court. Donald's personal history is briefly summed up. When very young he showed great talent and aptitude to learn, and remarkable tenacity of pur-   4 SNUFF-COOLORD TARTAN.     85 pose. He was particularly distinguished for a certain dexterity of hand, a quality that resides in the brain no doubt, though it appears elsewhere. He wrote beautifully at the age when children in general have scarcely got beyond pot-books, though his uncle always said that his penmanship was mark- ed by too great a predilection for flourishes and other ornaments. The same faculty made: him a capital hand at ball and cricket, a fisherman of ex- quisite tact, (the fact is Donald caught nearly every one of the fine trout that he and Tremaine sent to the Blakes,) a marksman infallible, skilled with the eye and ear,-in short, a handy fellow at every thing. Only he couldn't ride, because his seat was notfirm: his talent was in his hands. Accident (as people say) taught him that he could draw, rudely enough at first. He practised it; he got hold of colors. His uncle gave him a box of paints: so it went on At college he was wild: but in his senior year it happened that a fellow came along taking portraits  of the students. The travelling artist was a young man, (he afterwards became a famous artist,) and McAboy got acquainted with him. The passion seized him of being a painter. Followed a corres. pondence of some two years between the lad on one side and his uncle and mother on the other. The horror of the latter may be imagined. On! no ac-    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6851-00000044"/> 86     -BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. count whatever would she consent to such a degra- dation.. Mr. James McAboythought his nephew a fool, and wished him either to adopt a profession of greater certainty, or to enter a counting-house; so when Donald came of age he took the matter into his own hands, and with an obstinacy that charac- terized him, in spite of threats that he would be left to provide for himself, entered upon the pursuit he had chosen. Five or six years had since elapsed. He had studied awhile at home, supporting himself by working on backgrounds and accessories for his master. Then he managed to go abroad. I rather think his uncle James supplied the means, but so sparingly that the young man did not escape many severe privations. He had returned about a year before the date of my story, and had succeeded so well that, as we have seen, he thought of marrying. A sanguine temper and an utter disregard of obsta- cles might'have had something to do with his hardi- hood in this respect; and, also, it may be remembered that the young lady whom he so boldly asked to share his lot was the daughter of a wealthy mer- chant. To do Donald justice, however, I believe he thought little of that, and, in fact, as he said- his artistic experience had taught him independence in such matters: "I shall have a garret to paint in, any way; and a bed can hide behind the screen   A SNUFF-COLORED TARTAN.     87 there, as well as a lot of casts and things; and the woman that loves me must be willing to share these and a crust. Hundreds of artists have done it before me, whose works are now the glory of galleries!"- Thus Donald McAboy, although he was con- nected with wealthy people, owned a name asso- ciated with riches, and had a certain right to be rich himself (if all had been-fairly done,) was after all in reality a needy struggler, with vague splen- did hopes and real present necessities. At this time he was actually living nearly in the way he hinted at. His studio was the attic of a store in the Blooming Way, divided into rooms by large screens, and one of these was his bedchamber. Here he, took his sparing breakfast of bread and coffee, dined at an eating-house, and supped where it chanced, or not at all. - He had learned this way of life in Italy, and had got to prefer it. But in dress and some other things he adhered to the plain yet aris- . tocratic habits formed by his early education. He had not paid his tailor's bill yet, I confess, but he had no doubt of being able to do it in time. I must add that it was not long before Melanie Blake knew all these details as well as himself. It was rather a hard thing that he asked of her, to betroth her- self without the consent of her parents, to ia man    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6851-00000045"/> 88-     BBLONDE AND BBRNEE. with so uncertain a means of living; and who was in a sort disowned by his own family. It was no slight indication of Donald's resolved character and disdain of ordinary obstacles, that he ventured to ask it; but then he had overcome so many obstacles, and defied so much opposition, that it was become a necessary zest of life to encounter one or the other. I ought also to add that the morals of Mc- Aboy, unlike those of artists in general, had been austere. ^r *        ,     -  .   CHAPTER xmI. SUCCESS IN PORTRAITURE. No sooner were the Blakes established in their winter quarters, and the young ladies began to promenade in the Blooming Way on sunshiny mornings, like other fair Gothamites of their class, than they met Mr. Thomas Tremaine: for to saun- ter up and down that gay street was one of the serious avocations of his life. That he should greet them, and turn back and walk with them, was the next thing. Then, of course, he called ii Santaklaus Square, with Mr. McAboy, and Mr. Blake deemed  it a necessary civility to return their courtesy of the game by an invitation to dinner. So, as Tre. maine said, the fish was hooked, and it required nothing but patience and skill to land it. On a mountain-brook side he was nothing to Donald, but in the swift water of society no angler could be more skilful than Tom. He knew howto give his    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6851-00000046"/> 90     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. fair, gold-speckled monster line enough, and to a hair's-breadth how- much tension his would bear without breaking; but Donald was a little impet- uous, and was for lifting his struggling and darting prey out of the water by main force. He took Tremaine's advice, however, pretty much as Tremaine took his in the Sawan-gunk mountains, as they threaded down together the dashing streamlets, over rocks and under young trees. McAboy invited the ladies to visit his studio, ant an appointment was made for that purpose. They came. His pictures were shown, and while their admiration was fresh upon them, he seized the opportunity, solicited and obtained the permission of the unwary Mrs. Blake to paint a portrait of both sisters in one picture, for the next exhibition of the Gotham Academy. With a refinement of tact, Tremaine kept out of the way at this first studio visit.. So he did the first sitting the sisters had; but after the first, Xanthine and Melanie came without their mother, matronizing each other, and Melanie, in truth, was very grave and matron-like, though yielding sweet smiles and glances of naive admiration for Donald's pictures; Xanthine, on the other hand, was saucy and over- flowing with spirits, found an immensity of fault with the pictures, and said things to the delighted   SUCCESS IN PORTRAITURE.    91 McAboy, that bordered on the very edge of rude. ness, as Melanie averred. It happened also once or twice, by pure accident, that Tremaine called on his cousin when the Misses Blake were sitting, and although it was quite against McAboy's rules to receive male visitors at such times, a laugh of the vivacious Xanthine, while they were discussing the matter at the door, pro- cured Tremaine's admission; but it was singular that this extremely alarmed and annoyed-the sage Melanie, who declared she would tell their, mother if such a thing happened again. But Tremaine knew too well how to make his value felt, to need a resort to clandestine court- ship. His position in the society of Gotham allowed him to patronize the Blakes. He got the young ladies invitations which but for him they would not have had, and introduced the whole family, indeed, into a circle to which without such assistance they could not have gained admission. The Blakes' ac- quaintance was most respectable, it lay among people of wealth, and pretty equally between Posi- tives and Negatives; but Tremaine belonged to the creme de la crMme of Gotham. Why there were even Positive families, or families Positively connected, who previous to this winter, and Tre- maine's introduction, did not know the Blakes.    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6851-00000047"/> 92     :BLOMDE AND BRUNETrE. There was Mrs. Washington Lynch, for instance, (Charlie Lynch's cousin-Charlie, you know, being the a-direr of Xanthine)-there was Mrs. Lynch, I sayhpo lived in a double front granite house in the Blooming Way, and who had worked with her own hands a superb vestment for Father Rowman, had never advanced further than a bow and smile to the young ladies in Father Rowman's sacristy, or perhaps a chat with Mrs. Blake at a Positive Fair, where they were both on the Ladies' Com- mittee; and neither her partiality for their common spiritual guide, though so intimate with them, nor the eager persuasions of the aforesaid Charlie, had ever induced her to step out of her circle to the Blakes, or to invite them into it, (these things, she said, were "quite separate,") yet now, at a bare suggestion of Tremaine's,hinting that he shouldn't come very early or stay very late at her party un- less Miss Xanthine Blake were there, left cards the very next day in Santaklaus Square, (nice situa- tion I as she envyingly said, and so it was!) and, with the card, pretty little printed notes (as the manner then was) signifying her desire for the pleasure of the company of Mr., Mrs., Miss, and Miss Xanthine Blake, at such an hour on such an evening, at "No 560 Blooming Way." --'Of course the Blakes accepted the invitation,   SUCCESS TN PORTRAITI E.    93 and they had a vague idea that they owed it to the admiration which their daughters had excited in two young men so fashionably connectedl Tre- maine and McAboy, and in accepting the-benefit they could not decline the cause. They knew very well that there would be no sweeter-looking, more modest or more prettily-behaved girls in all that. throng than theirs, and naturally they must wish  them to enjoy themselves, to be noticed by their friends, to be danced with and promenaded and introduced. Tremaine did all this, and no one's attention could be more flattering to a girl's vanity in such a scene. He danced with them both, but most with Xanthine; he walked with her, he introduced her to Mrs. Leary Mortimer (Miss Belle Randolph that was) the rival of Mrs. Lynch in fashion, not so serenely sumptuous, but a more brilliant and younger beauty, and proud of her descent from ' one of the first families" of Dominia, the greatest and most ancient commonwealth, as we have ob- served, in the Columbian confederacy. I must say that the young ladies, once started in this circle, got on very well, quite to my sur- prise indeed at the time, for I made their acquaint- ance the same evening. Mrs. Lynch had had them in a manner forced upon her by "that indis-    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6851-00000048"/> "    BLONDE BAUNETE. -e sable Mr. Tremaine," as she said, and I think sh&amp; iant to receive them with a frigid excess of pO     i-o make herself amends. I saw her shjv  hite shoulders slightly at Xanthine's fra iiliarity, which, I must say, just fell short of vulgarity, by the evident fact that the child did not dream of anybody being superior to her father and mother and Melanie! But Melanie colored so vividly at Xanthine's want of tact, and yet whis- pered a reproof with such a pretty air of tender- ness, that Madame was captivated from that mo- ment. She appreciated manner so much, although I am sure it was the inimitable trait of gooduess which really won her heart. Mrs. Leary, on the contrary (how could she suspect such a young thing had ever been her rival?) petted Xanthine extravagantly, indolently charmed with that warm- hearted, natural young Celt. So did Leary him- self, and I verily believe it was the wish to show him- that he was not so great a loss as he supposed; or as Xanthine said to Melanie, that there were as good fish in the sea as ever were caught, which made her encourage, as she did in her gay, laugh- -ing way, the particular devotion of Tom Tremaine. At all events, Xanthine's wit, liveliness and gen- erous simplicity, took with the multitude; they conceded to her, as people generally will, the posi- 4   SUCCESS IN PORTRAITUR S    95 tion that she seized so unconsciously. And if some  more critical judges stopped to examine hexf:re tensions, they generally turned to Mel served, but with so much in her), and" '" on- tent to say they "preferred Aiss Blake  er sister." Fairly launched, then, that first night, in the gayest society of Gotham, my young heroines went  from party to party, in what was for them a whirl of dissipation, at least all through the Christmas holidays and the festive season that lies between them and the inauguration of Lent; and amid it all, as a little rivulet swells by flowing on, so that what was at first a thread of water across which one might stride, becomes at last a deep and wide stream and needs a boat or a bridge to pass it, in like manner the love of these young ladies, fed by a thousand occasions, and gathering increase from every side, swelled into a stream of passion, neck- deep, no longer fordable, and hurrying on swiftly to a fall. For the nature of the country did not allow of a gradual descent to the sea; there was a point where the level changed abruptly, and where the now smooth and scarce murmuring waters must fling themselves in foam down a precipice to seek the vale whither they tend. -Xanthine being now in love with Tons Tre-    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6851-00000049"/> 96     BLQN  AND BmUNTE. aeane, it followed that her heart was all in that - gayworld where he shone, as well. as her form. By se (for she took from her father's side of the hiv) she was Celtically careless and what I may call slipshod about her person. I don't mean that her apparel was not whole and clean; such untidiness belongs to a lower class in society; but her cape or collar, or whatever girls wore on their necks, was sure to be pinned on one side, Melanie said; her ringlets, when her sister had made them droop in glossy golden spirals, were thrown back the first time they fell over her face, or tucked unceremoniously behind her ears, and if a child dragged out her comb, back it went " any how," said her sister, (mmicking Xanthine's careless ac- tion,) with a finger's length of the beautiful braid hanging loose. If Xanthines slipper untied, and it was not 'in a convenient place to adjustit, she would" snap off" the strings or laces, and- go so all day."-"Well, I don't care, now," Xanthine would say, plaintively, c I look well enough; and I declare, Melanie, you are a real old maid." It was wonderful what a transformation Tre- maine's influence produced in this dowdyish Xan- thine. I know thatI McAboy, who admired her former picturesque negligence, averred that she reminded him -now of one of the colored fashion re.  aai               **Ow a   SUCCESS IN PORTRAITUR.

Then Melanie would say in her own national, yet subdued way,-"Mr. Tremaine's taste, .you know, is 'law and gospel' with Xanthine. I only wish Iwere as plump and rosy as she is." Yet Tom, though he hovered around her per- petually, didn't speak out, and Xanthine wondered why, innocently attributing his delay sometimes to a lover's timidity, and sometimes to an excessive delicacy in regard to her expectations. For Pat- rick Blake, Esq., would sometimes say-- Don't go to be taken in, now, girls! by these danglin' fops, that are afther your feyther's money-bags more than for ye'rselves. I'll be hanged if one ov 'em shall ever get me consint to have ye."--Mr; Blake even affected to talk in this manner, and the  more as he grew richer and older, as if to show he could aford to have a brogue. So Xanthine vibrated. in her manner to Tremaine, between fright- ened reserve, and frank, tender encouragement: for she had no fear of her father's threats, believing 6 Hi I -     <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6851-00000050"/> 98    --LOElD A"D BDRU'TE. that he was too kind to thwart her; and seeing no real difficulty, from her very vivacity of temper and natural candor, she became at last perfectly "serable with concealing her virtuous feelings, and longed with an impatience she could hardly restrain, for the explanation which would author. ize her to send him to her papa, and to sob out her own story upon her mother's bosom. I wonder that Melanie did not watch better over her sister. I wonder she did not tell their mother. I fear she was too selfishy absorbed in her own situation, or perhaps her peculiar embar- rassment was so different that one of the nature of Xanthine's did not strike her. My belief is that Melanie was more changed than her sister, by her passion. If Father Rowman missed her kneel- ing form at the rite which he was wont to celebrate about daybreak by a dim-lighted altar on the cold winter mornings, it might be said that she had re- turned too late from the party of the evening pre- vious. If her chaplet, which once she said as regularly as the sun, was omitted day after day, the social duty of returning calls interfered no doubt with that act of devotion. Lent was coming, and would give ample time to be good. But Lent came and found Melanie still occupied. She might truly say that she cared nothing for the parties to   SUCCESS IN POiATRiBiR.     99  which she could no longer go, nor for the more easily granted indulgence of the theatre and opera Melanie now was full of Art, and the more tie general whirl of dissipation was quieted, the more leisure had she for this fascinating pursuit Po etry, for which Donald was an enthusiast, was a suitable recreation, she thought all must allow, for Lent. Music, in which he was a proficient, might be cultivated at all times; and Painting, whichwas his profession, was a lawful pursuit on the most sacred days, as Father Rowman himself acknowl- edged. Melanie learned to talk of "keeping" and "efitect," of "composition," "drawing," " chiar 'oscuro,", and " haltints, She knew all the collat- eral themes, was up to the difference between line engraving and stippling, of proofs before and after lettering, discriminated the great masters in McA. boys fine collection of prints, and appreciated the fame and genius, not only of Raphael, but of Raphael Morghen.

Her per- son, indeed, gave visible signs of her artistic pre- occupation. She ransacked all the shops in the Blooming Way for the exact tints of silk or ribbon that suited her complexion or that produced a rich and harmonious dress, used a large classic cameo to pin her shawl, and taught her robe to flow like drapery.               f Donald's portrait of the sisters was finished about the close of the year and was really a hit. It was hung in the Blakes' front drawing-room on New Year's Day, and afforded a fresh topic to the numerous visitors who poured in upon such a fam- ily on that favorite festival of the Gothamites. Those who saw and admired it, (and all who saw, admired;) bore the theme away to the next house, and all the fair damsels to whom their cavaliers described it, were of course excited with a strong desire to be painted in the same style themselves. Without sacrificing the fidelity of the likenesses, McAboy, inspired by love as much as by his ge- nius, had succeeded in imparting an ideal character -an expression of poetry and simplicity-to those lovely sisterly faces, which charmed every beholder. By a happy theft, (since the fashion of the day was any thing but poetical,) he stole both the grouping an the costume from a picture by Titian, of which   SUCOESS IN PORTRBAITUE.    101   , he had an admirable engraving, while in the back- ground he introduced Red Fort, with the Hendrick and the Arrowheads, to the delight of the Gotham- ites. The extreme beauty of local color in the heads, which beauty was caught from nature, gained him likewise much applause, and perhaps in the eyes of the few good judges, was not only the greatest merit of the picture, but the best proof of his real talent and knowledge of his art. It procured him immediately a crowd of sitters, chief. ly ladites, and several commissions. Mr. De Gro- tius, a great patron of the arts among the old Go- thamites, being second cousin to Mrs. Blake, had called, according to his invariable custom, in Santa- klaus square on New Year's day, to eat a bit of her spiced cake and drink half a glass of Madeira wine, then part with the compliments of the sea- son, not to see or speak to her again till the next Anno Domini. Mr. De Grotius was wonderfully pleased with the portrait of his " charming cous- ins," both of whom he kissed in the most orthodox manner, and having asked the address of the paint- er, which was written for him on a card in a minute by the blushing Melanie, (the old gentleman shook his cane at her with a funny air, whereat all the ladies laughed,) what followed, of course, but that a few days after he dropped in upon Mr. MeAboy,    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6851-00000052"/> 102     BLONDE iAiN BRUITT LE. bought his unfinished "Cardinal and Columbus" and ordered as a pendant to it, a subject of his own selection, "Galileo in the Inquisition?" The venerable Gothamite staid about two hours explaining to Donald his idea of the picture and of the character of Galileo. "Above all," said he, "let the apartment be comfortable,-luxurious, if you please-furnished with a pair of globes and rich old books. Don't forget a flask of Orvieto on the table, with grapes, and olives, and pasticceria, like an Italian dessert; and let there be a pale, meek Dominican friar, in his white robes, listening incredulously to the argu- ments of the philosopher." "It will be a satire," said Donald, smiling. "I mean it so," said Mr. De Grotius. The day after, a serene yet melancholy Jewish gentleman, who introduced himself as a friend of Mr. De Grotius, called, looked at Donald's pictures, and gave him a commission for- "Rebecca in Ivan- hoe," leaving at the same time a sun-drawing, (qy. daguerreotype?) of a very beautiful woman in an Oriental costume, to serve as a model. He told Donald that it had been taken in the Asiatic city of Ismir, from his only sister, who was married there; and on going away, he gave his card,- "Mr. Manuel Seijas, No. 7 State street:" which   SUCCESS IN PORTRAITURE.    103 called up to McAboy a pleasant line of mansions in the ancienter part of Gotham. Melanie was delighted with Donald's success, and excessively proud of his growing reputation. It was plain that he would give the lie to the dis. couraging predictions of his friends, and achieve both fame and fortune in the career that he had chosen. As day after day brought some new sitter to his studio, or some new praise of his talent to her ears, she regarded each as a pledge that her father's consent to their union would be granted, though it might be granted with difficulty. A sort of conditional compact, more implied than express- ed, now existed between them, wrapping up her future consent with that of her parents, whenever Donald chose or would venture to ask it. Even so, this young believer in a supernatural creed, which has a terror for every deviation from the straight path, used often to tremble for herself, lest the loss of her earthly happiness, or worse, might be the consequence of her undutiful concealment, her rash, if not profane, attachment. Often and often she felt prompted to go to her mother and confess her own affair, as well as the way that Xanthine was going on. But then Xanthine had been, or thought herself in love many times before-was it not likely she would get over it this time bs well? i,    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6851-00000053"/> 104    BLONDE AND BRtNETTE. How unkind to the child, before Tremaine h1i spoken, to betray her folly? Wasn't it probable, their mother saw it as well as she (Melanie) did? In the mean time a new care drove such thoughts away-scattered them as the hawk does the inno- cent brood of the farm yard. With the first dawn of his fame, a man of genius; especially if he be un- married, finds himself surrounded at once by ad- mirers of the other sex; and Melanie, although Donald, by his new scale e of prices, was to get a hundred and fifty dollars for every single portrait he painted, was sorely annoyed by his female sitters. -Either they were too beautiful, (in Gotham that would often be the case,) or they did not conduct themselves agreeably to Melanie's strict notions of propriety. In one way or another she was sure to find this out, so that one would have supposed she had an invisible spy in Donald's studio, or that a bird of the air brought her the tale of what hap- pened there. Poor girl! what a contrast to the calm she used to enjoy when she had only her own heart to watch over, and her own daily faults and infirmities to reprove and be sorry for, in the nightly examen! Truly she thought then she had trouble enough, and mortifications sufficient, but it was perfect peace and self-complacency, compared   SUCCESS IN PORTRAITiURE.   105 to her present agitations. She ought to have had, you will say, a nobler confidence in her lover; but how could she help seeing what was so very plain to less observant eyes, that Donald had a passion- ate and almost idolatrous love of beauty, and that his standard of beauty, as he owned, and gloried in it, was that of Pagan Art? The bright hair, the cheek of rose, the rounded and wavy form -say of dear Xanthine-how had he ever prized them! There was a certain Miss Virginia Randolph, a sister of Mrs. Leary Mortimer, and decidedly the belle of the season, who from the moment that McAboy's success was trumpeted, ran wild for him. Before Donald emerged from the cloud, she had nearly broken "Xanthine's heart,' as Melanie said, by her desperate flirting with Tremaine, whose star now paled before that of his cousin, all refulgent with genius and nobility: for Miss Virginia found that out too. The long descent of the McAboys, and the ancient castle of Mull, and Donald's mother the Baroness, were topics on which she constantly entertained him while sitting for her portrait in the character of a noble page. It was a half-length, of course, (for of " doublet and hose" only half was admissible even in a portrait)-and Donald gave her a rich, umber-brown, satin doublet with A*          do   with    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6851-00000054"/> 1Q6   ?: BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. a plume, of the same deep tint, to which Miss Rag  dolph strongly objected, although McAboy insisted that it put in best relief her glowing complexion, and at last she owned she disliked it from its re- semblance to the color of swuf. This was Tre- maine's 'story, which made Xanthine (heartily: and Melanie (bitterly) laugh. Still, the latter could not help making excuses to visit McAboy's studio, with her sister or some other friend, all the while this portrait was going on, for however silly Miss Randolph might be, she was a beauty all the same, and her odious forwardness ("Oh how different from Xanth's unsuspecting candor!") had a fasci- nation for the "gentlemen," which nearly drove Melanie distracted. One day the latter was engaged in shopping and making calls with her friend Mrs. Lynch, and as it was not one of Miss Randolph's days, she was quite easy in her mind. But at last they stopped at Mrs. Mortimer's to perform the fashion- able ceremony of leaving cards, the ladies, as they expected, being out on so fine a day. Mrs. Lynch quietly opened her card case, without a word either of pleasure or the contrary, but Melanie leaned forward and beckoning to the servant, said as she produced hers-"Did they go out to- gether?"-"No, miss," the man replied , "Mrs.   4n SUCCESS IN PORTRAITURE.     107 :Mortimer went out first in the carriage, and Miss Randolph walked out by herself afterwards."-Me- lanie leaned back, and placed her card with Mrs. Lynch's in silence, but with a changing counte- nance. This was in Crayon Place, and Donald's rooms were just on the corner in the Blooming Way. So when the carriage, now driving rapidly home, (for Melanie was to dine enfamille with her friend,) turned into the great thoroughfare, she ex- claimed as if the thought had suddenly struck her. --"Oh! Josephine! let us stop at Mr. McAboy's studio. He has no sitters to-day, and it will be such a fine chance." Melanie meant a fine opportu- nity; but she was a true, unaffected little Gotham- ite. "What a dear, good-for-nothing hypocrite you are!" said Mrs. Lynch, drawing the check-string, (as ladies' novels say,) and the carriage stopped at the door where-to pursue the same style-with that of a fashionable milliner who had her show- rooms on the second floor, Donald's modest sign glittered-)D. McABOY, in gilt letters on a dark brown tin. The ladies got out, and as the door was always open, ascended without delay the long stairs, which filled the whole breadth of the nar- row hall.                      i'    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6851-00000055"/> CHAPTER XIV. IA STUDIO  SCENE. THE ground floor of the store was the shop of a fashionable jeweller, whose glittering wares filled the plate-glass windows of enormous panes, and among these were seen many elegant works of art as well as of luxury-bronze groups, and Parian statuettes, of every variety of subject, from the Christ of Thorwaldsen to the voluptuous Ariadne of Dannecker. The first flight of well-carpeted stairs from the side entrance of the building, led to a landing where glass doors opened into the show- rooms of Madame Rose Ruban. Here on long tables stood little iron frames, each supporting a "Iove of a bonnet," and intermingled with the ready sales-women all around the tables, stood loves of ladies, admiring, trying on, pricing and buying those adorable chefs dPceuvres of millinery. Xanthine and Melanie both got their bonnets this year of Madame Ruban, which is to say that they ^   A STUDIO SCENE. 109 were perfect; so did Mrs. Lynch hers, always; and Mrs. Mortimer, hers; and Miss Randolph had pre- sented to her on New Year's day, one of the love- liest and most bewitching hats (as the Gothamites called them) to which Madame Ruban herself ever gave the finishing touch. It was considered so beautiful that when Miss R. had worn it long 'enough to take off the novelty, but not to soil or injure it the least in the world, she laid it by in a band-box, meaning to dazzle the Dominians with it, in case she went home during the winter; but she did not, and the band-box got left behind at  her abrupt departure from Gotham, and some two or three seasons after-an age in millinery-- chanced to come to light; I saw it opened by a party of young ladies at Mrs. Mortimer's, and such screams of laughter I desire never to hear again- "Is it possible," cried they to Mrs. M., "you ever wore such a fright of a bonnet as that! Oh, the hideous thing!"-And one after another tried it on, "While unextinguished laughter shook the skies." But this is a digression, since our story has nothing in particular to do with the bonnets of Madame Ruban. To proceed; the second flight of stairs, which was , . wa    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6851-00000056"/> "O     BLONDE AND BRUNETIE. narrower, led to the story occupied by the work- rooms of that lady's establishment, and here, too, the doors were usually open, showing a considerable number of young females within, all busily occupied in the various departments of bonnet making, but most of whom, however, found time to look up or turn their heads when any one passed. And no doubt a keen-eyed medical man, arresting his stepsi on the threshold, would have been able to determine pretty accurately, from the eye, the complexion, the figure, the attitude in sitting, the general air and nameless expression of each, with what variety of physical, or even mental or moral disorder she was affected, in consequence of the sedentary occu- pation, the confined atmosphere, the lack of pure air and general exercise, the objects of ingenious vanity which it was their business to create, by the infection of that frivolity, extravagance and wilful- ness to which they ministered in their humble work- room, by all the consequences of a slender salary, by the week of leisureless, fretting toil, monoto- nous and minute, and the holiday of indolent pros- tration or idle, perhaps sinful, amusement, by the rust of evil thoughts never removed from the mind's fair surface, or the stain of evil words and actions never purified,-who does not know these things, and who knows how to remedy them? j^   A STUDIO SCENm.      1" These young women havenot much to do with our story either, except that when the sisters were sitting to Donald, Xanthine's giddiness brought her and Melanie one day into their work-room, where the fore-woman treated them with great politeness as customers of Madame,-"There go two of our bonnets up-stairs!, was the expression of one, when the young ladies first passed the door-and Xan- thine in her merry way asked the girls questions respecting Mr. McAboy. Did he come down and "make love to them? Was he a civil neighbor? And so on. And the girls gave him an excellent character. Mr. McAboy was very friendly, they said, and very much of a gentleman. He used to watch them making endless changes of bows, and fitting them on with a dexterity and taste worthy of nobler employments, and condescended to give his opinion in regard to the colors and combina- tions of flowers and silk. One of the girls was pointed out as his favorite-a giggling, blushing creature, who monopolized all the carmine of this pale sisterhood in her cheeks and lips, and was pos- sessed of extraordinary fine eyes. She had sat to Donald for her eyes and lips, and once for her arm, which was also of great beauty. She told Melanie that he was "very funny and a perfect gentleman, " which Melanie understood as well as the blunt ex-    <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6851-00000057"/> "2    i 40BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. pressions of another-a young lady from the East- ern State of Penobscot-who said, in a loud voice before everybody, "Mr. McAboy isn't proud nor nothin', neither; he's jus' so, he is; and he never takes no liberties with nobody, nor says nothin' im- proper, he don't --which made Melanie blush and say quickly; "Oh, of course not!"But Xanthine laughed outright. Donald's rooms were on the floor above that occupied by these young ladies, and his stair, being closed in with a door at the foot, secured by lock and bolt, went straight up into his anteroom-for the whole floor was his apartment, from back to front, lighted principally from above, and divided off by dark-brown screens into three rooms, afford- ing a fine vista when the doors were open, broken by India-red draperies, white casts, tall easels, and pictures new and old. The middle portion was the painting-room; beyond that was a sleeping, bath and dressing-room, all in one. It was a share in these accommodations that he had had the courage to offer to Melanie Blake, till now that his popular- ity made him feel the necessity of supporting (if he married) a style more conformable to the opinions of the world, Talk of independence! It is the poor and obscure who alone are independent. The rich and the celebrated are the slaves of all mankind. 9 E    A STUDIO SCENE.      113 Donald was alone that morning, it being one of the days when he had no sitters. His business had reached that point that it was necessary, in order to secure time for his historical subjects, to confine the portraiture to certain days. He had some time since finished the Columbus, and was now engaged upon the Galileo, for which he anticipated a long morning of genial, uninterrupted labor. I know not why your gifted artist is usually represented in novels and romantic stories as a rather unhealthy, morbidly imaginative individual, with a strong ten- dency (the only strong thing about him) to consump- tion or insanity. Donald was not of this sort cer- tainly. His frame was singularly vigorous and athletic; his chest was broad and deep; his limbs well formed and muscular. He wore at his work a reddish-brown robe (his favorite color-the same to which Miss Randolph objected from its resem- blance to that of snuff) trimmed with fur, and a velvet cap to match it, made like that with which Leonardo da Vinci is usually painted. In Italyi where McAboy wore his whole beard, he was said to resemble the portrait of Da Vinci, and the ar- tists at the Greco used to call him Leonardo. There was a general massiveness and gravity in Donald's physiognomy that bore out the title well enough. After his genius was acknowledged, indeed people    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6851-00000058"/> "4     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. discovered that he was handsome, though large- featured; that he had an immense volume of brain gloriously housed ; while over the orbits of his pen etrating eyes the perceptive faculties (using the language of phrenology, without meaning to say, if I think it true or false) had built their most impos- ing, low-browed arch. Donald's manner of working was interesting. His movements were deliberate, quiet, steady. When actually using the pencil, his touch was rapid and decisive, but not hurried, not abrupt. Often he was tranquilly absorbed in thought, or gazed upon his picture, while with slow (as if delighted) certainty of skill, he mixed the colors on his palette, and a smile of ineffable sweetness wreathed his calm lips. For my part I never wondered that many a girl was found for whom that undoubted power had attractions, and who could discover a great charm in that dark, massively featured face, iri the broad white brow overhanging it, in the piercing eye, the deep manly voice, and stout, but well-knit frame of McAboy, which if not precisely graceful in its outlines, was eminently so in his carriage of it. And besides, there was one thing about Donald which made him immensely capti- vating, as Melanie, for instance, considered it.- With- his ardent susceptibility for the beautiful,   A STBDIO 8ENE.       115 which determined his choice of Art, and drew him on in the pursuit of it, by the perpetual allurement of pleasure, there was united a tenacity of will most remarkable. McAboy not only aimed at the beautiful, not only was passionately affected by it, but he patiently toiled to acquire the minutest de- tail of practical skill necessary to create it, and in all his social intercourse, however ardently he might love, however eagerly he might enjoy, the end of his art was steadily in view. He had concentration of purpose, and this is a quality which strongly at- tracts others, Art was his mistress, and his de- votion to her gained him the favor of many a one besides. "But Virginia Randolph may appreciate this noble passion as well as I," thought Melanie, with an impatient sigh, " and perhaps she can gratify it more." Donald was at work, as I mentioned, on the picture of Galileo. He had read up the history in a book Mr. De Grotius lent him, and it had inter- ested his imagination. Opposite him, pinned to a portfolio that rested on an easel, was an Italian engraving of the head of the astronomer. It was a clear, logical, self-sufficient head and face, such as you may see in many of our modern reformers and progressive people. Donald was working it in f&amp;,    <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6851-00000059"/> "6 1-   BLONDS AND BRUaarrrE. mously, giving breadth and grandeur, yet preserv- ing a strong identity of character. The figure was already sketched on the canvas in outline, and the spectres of a table, books, a globe, a decanter or flask of wine, fruit, of a pug-nosed, progressive looking dog under the philosopher's chair, and of a standing figure in sacerdotal robes, were likewise delineated. McAboy had rejected his patron's idea of a Domini- can friar, and preferred to follow the history by in- troducing the Cardinal, the friend of Galileo, in whose house he was at one time actually confined. After long efforts to conjure down the phantom of Father Rowman, which still haunted his fancy, he had succeeded in calling up the countenance that realized his conception. He made a drawing of it immediately on the canvas intended for the picture, and so perfectly did it satisfy his idea, that, forthwith securing it by India ink, he had at once paintind in the carnations and filled in the details, with light washes of paint, fearing to lose the ex. pression by charging too richly with color. This head, then,-serene, princely, benevolent, a little derisive and softly contemptuous-was finished, and looked down upon the forming features of the philosopher. It was that of one who admitted the physical truth the latter was defending, but calmly opposed its being set up against the apparent au-   A STDIO SCENE.      117 thority of the sacred books, with the intention of discrediting their inspiration. The humor of this picture was peculiarly in the vein of McAboy, whose love for ancient poetry made him consider that the old theory of the sun going round the earth and dipping each night his flaming axle in the western ocean-the theory of the senses-was far better adapted to influence the imagination than the mathematical system of Galileo and Copernicus. But as the fates would have it, (as he said after- wards,) he was not destined that day to finish in peace the figure of the starry Galileo. We have, indeed, insinuated our description of the work in which he was engaged, to show what a martyr he was to the forwardness of one young lady and the jealousy of another. For while he was innocently deepening the healthful glow of age in the cheek of the Florentine discoverer, a soft, musical tingle- ingle-ingle of his bell warned him of a visitor. With the palette on his thumb, and the mahl-stick in hand, he went to the head of the stair, and by Ihe aid of a string (an invention he had imported from Italy) raised the latch of the door below. The latter opened, and who should enter the little lobby but Miss Virginia Randolph? The young lady was attired in her famous .bon- net, and in a habit to match of rich browB satin of    <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6851-00000060"/> "8     BLOD ANDE :-BRtUNITE. great elegance, with large sleeves and cuffs, and rich flowing lace collar and sleeves, (McAboy him- self--designed the jacket or corsage,) in which, since she had been persuaded out of her objection to the color, she was accustomed to sit to him; and the astute painter divined in a moment that for that purpose she had come. From the top of the stair-a brief flight-his dark eye twinkled with a grave humor as it looked down upon the elegant apparition. It had come, said the ghost in lace and brown satin-the brownie I might call it--to ask if Mr. McAboy-(Here the door behind her, closed of its own accord with a soft slam, by reason of a patent spring with which it was furnished, and Miss Virginia started and cried Gracious!") to ask if Mr. McAboy (advancing a step or two in- genuously up the stair) could not name an earlier  hour for the sitting of to-morrow, as Bell (her sis- ter) was engaged after twelve o'clock and could not accompany her. The painter began politely-"' Pray walk up and sit down, Miss Virginia," she came up and took the edge of a chair for form's sake.

Miss Melanie Blake, I am sure, would be too happy." "Miss Melanie Blake! , cried the brown ghost with manifest impatience. "No, I don't want her. She is always here, I think, at my sittings. I would rather come all alone by myself than she should be here to play spy!" "As you please, DMiss Virginia. Suppose you stay now. What hinders?" quoth the painter, mixing several tints upon his palette in a quiet way, to form a most beautiful brown, which had a singu- lar resemblance to the color of the ghost's glossy, abundant hair, and of her large liquid eyes. "What!" cried the brownie, with a merry laugh, and bending her beautiful head and hat al- most to her knee-" what! all by myself! How droll you are, Mr. McAboy! But just for the joke of the thing I have a great mind to take you at your word." "I shan't feel in the least degree awkward if you do," said the artist.

"What was that?" demanded the ghost, with a bewildered look, and in perfect simplicity. , "What the fille noble wears under her satin, and the beggar under her rags, and neither ever puts off," quoth the painter, with a smile. "You talk in riddles," said the brownie, more puzzled still, "and I was always dull at a conun- drum.  But you really think that I had better take my sitting now, since I can't come to-mor- row?" "Certainly," replied the artist, with a sparkling eye. "Come, Miss Virginia! I will paint you to- day as you were never painted." He went before her-into the painting-room and turned the Galileo with its face to the wall: "What a fool!" he in- ternally exclaimed; "but as handsome as Venus;   A STUDIO SCENE.      121 and no opportunity is to be neglected of making one's-self familiar with that divine form by which alone our art is able to express the greatest thoughts.", So while this weak young lady was led into a very indiscreet action, by her infatuated love, (I suppose I must call it,) the artist was induced to encourage her in it by the ruling motive of acquir. ing a good study for his portfolio, and increase of knowledge for his teeming brain-in which he was more successful than he anticipated, as he always counted on being obliged to contribute out of his own stores the expression to those features, and that form, which wanted nothing else to be as beau- tiful and noble, in his opinion, as any thing mortal could be. Miss Randolph, indeed, rattled away in her usual thoughtless manner, while she was taking off her bonnet and arranging her brown hair to float on her shoulders in the way required by the pic- ture, but she had not been long seated in the sit- ter's chair before she started up, exclaiming: "Sup- pose, Mr. McAboy, that some of your friends should drop in upon you unceremoniously? They would walk right in, perhaps. Oh! I should die of embarrassment.", "The door is latched," replied the painter  6    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6851-00000062"/> 122    BLONDE AND BR'BtRUTiE1 . coolly, directing her with the mahl-stick to resume her position. "Nobody can get in without a -pass- key." Oh, dear!" resuming her seat with an air of mingled satisfaction and fright; "then we are locked in! Oh, my goodness!" cried the fair Yengeese, (as foreigners call all the inhabitants of the Columbian confederacy,) turning quite pale, "what should I do, Mr. McAboy, if some of your lady friends were to call and insist on coming up?" "I would not admit them further than the ante- room," said Donald, keenly watching her and paint- ing. "That's my rule when I have sitters. If you liked I would tell them I had a model; which would effectually bar their curiosity." "A model!" cried Virginia, clasping her hands and bursting into tears, "Just now, Mr. McAboy, you insinuated that I was a wild goose (I under- stood your allusion to water-fowl and web-footed creatures, sir!) and now you hint that I am a model! I see that that is the only light in which you regard me!"weeping and using her lace-edged handkerchief. With difficulty Donald soothed her. He con- vinced her that he had meant nothing by the word model, "because," said he, "a model is paid for   A STUDIO SCENE.       123 sitting, whereas you are to pay me for painting you.  "I am sure that makes a great difference!" said Miss Randolph, with a little half-offended, half-appeased shake of the head, But the web-footed allusion was not so easily made clear, (which shows the danger of talking poetry to fools, or to those whom you think such,) and the even balance of tranquillity could not be restored. Nor was the-ecaI  and subtle painter sorry, we fear. He sympathized deeply with his sitter's distress, of course; but professional interest overpowered his sympathy, so that the chief thing after all of which he was sensible in her mortal per- turbation, was the serious and passionate play which it gave to her perfect features, and which, with the unconscious attitude of listening expectation and alarm that her no less perfect figure assumed, ar- rested his attention, and was eagerly transferred'to the canvas, now with the pencil armed with colors, and now with the more rapid crayon. "I am going to make a surprising picture of you," said he at last, in his quietest manner. "Shall I explain it? (A little more to the right, if you please.

"To account for this," pursued the imperturba- ble Donald, with a sweet smile, (as if that were amends enough,) " the background (I shall work it in as soon as you are gone) is the dark stone wall of a prison (I shall charge it with color, but the general tone of the picture will be so deep and rich that it will appear of a cool gray) '- "You know," said Virginia, "that I never understand about the tone of a picture. You must talk to Miss Melanie Blake about those things." "Well, on this gray prison wall behind you the sunlight plays through a grated window, of which it defines the form by the shadow. You are looking up at the window itself, (which we can't see,) but we perceive by the shadow on the wall that the bars are partly wrenched off.

TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES. WHEN Mrs. Lynch and Melanie arrived at Mc- Aboy's door, and the former had rung, they stood gayly chatting about the place and its convenience, and the vicinage of Madame Ruban's establish- ment, for at least three minutes, yet nobody came, and Mrs. Lynch said -"He is out." "No, he is not," replied Miss Blake," for I heard some one step quite plainly."--"Oh, then, let us rouse him up," cried the fashionable matron, turning quickly to the bell-handle, to which she gave another pull, heartier than the first, as much as to say-"Come, I'm not going to have my journey up these stairs for nothing!"And after a brief further delay the latch was lifted, the ladies pushed the door open against the resistance of the spring, and lo! McAboy, in his painting-robe, the palette on his   TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES.   127 thumb, and the mahl-stick in his hand, at the head of the stair. "Is that the way you keep your lady-visitors waiting, Mr. Donald?" asked Mrs. Lynch, in a brusque manner that she often affected, besides that she was distantly related to the McAboys. "Not all of them, I bet," said the younger lady, sotto voce. "Please walk up, ladies," said McAboy. "I hope you will excuse my having made you wait, as I was really at the moment so engaged that I could not break off." "Oh, I excuse you since you have let us in at last," said Mrs. Lynch, "and so, I presume, does Miss Blake.", "I trust so," said Donald, taking Melanie's hand for a moment. She noticed that his hand trembled, and that his manner altogether was agitated; neither cir- cumstance was unusual in addressing herself, or in exchanging the common greeting of friendship with her; but she knew not whether that lack of self-command in a person otherwise so calm ought in this instance to gratify her so much as it gener- ally did. I am not sure that it ought not to have gratified her more, for charming as Melanie was to the eye that judged by the exquisite indications of    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6851-00000065"/> 128     BLONDE AND BRUNKETE. talent, feeling, modesty and purity, playing over her clear features or permanently enthroned there, in the point of mere personal beauty, of the physi- cal traits of woman, she could not but suffer ip the immediate comparison of Virginia Randolph, espe- cially when an inveterate classicist like McAboy was to decide. Melanie did not expect that Donald would invite them into the painting-room, (she was sure there was a reason why he should not,) but he did invite them, with an air somewhat embarrassed, so that she was puzzled again what to think. Oh, you haven't a sitter, then?" said Mrs. Lynch, carelessly, "I began to think you had, not- withstanding Melanie said it was one of your days for 'history '-isn't that what you call it, dear?" "I hardly venture to call my fancy pictures historical," replied McAboy. "De genre, I sup- pose, is what they may fairly be termed." "Pray show us all you have got here, Mr. Mc- Aboy," exclaimed Melanie, with sweet animation; for her suspicions vanished when she saw the Ga- lileo on the easel, and her heart reproached her for having felt them. "See, Josephine! this is only the commencement of one, but isn't it beautiful? Was ever any thing finer than the head of the Cardinal? How firm that man's will is! how clear   TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES.    129 his ideas! Can't you see it all? It is a sort of a Positive picture," (in a whisper,) "though Donald -Mr. McAboy, I mean-does not acknowledge that." "It is merely my conception of the truth of the history, and of the characters introduced," said McAboy gravely. "Yes," said Melanie, with great sweetness and vivacity, "but, as Father Rowman observed to you, sir, the truth of history is all on our side. So it is-isn't it, Josephine? I have always heard that ever since I was born." Donald laughed, and then checked himself. "Have you done much to it this morning?" asked Melanie, in a confidential tone, (Mrs. Lynch, like most well-bred people who know nothing about pictures, said nothing, but looked and listened.) "Not a great deal," replied McAboy, with constraint. "I have been over the head of Galileo once-nearly.", "Oh! for a whole morning's work that is very little. I'm afraid you have been dreaming, Don- ald, (the last word or two in an absolute whisper.) Let's see what else there is here." She rose quickly, and at the same moment Mrs. Lynch asked McAboy to explain the meaning of the wine-flask, glass, and plate of fruit, all carefully 6*    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6851-00000066"/> 130    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. drawn in outline upon the table in the picture. He did so with an eye upon Melanie, who presently singled out the Columbus, and begged him to bring it forward. While he was settling it on the easel-it was the largest size of easel-pictures-she stepped back, and in her confiding way turned a canvas that was stuck in a corner as if there were something on it. "Oh," said she, in a sarcastic tone, "here's the Page, Josephine." "Is that Virginia Randolph?" said Mrs. Lynch, immediately interested. "Let'us see it, pray?" "Pardon me," said Donald, hastily taking it from Melanie's hands-" it is wet." "But you will show it to us, won't you?"Mrs. Lynch said, for Melanie was now silent. McAboy rather doggedly placed it in a position to be seen. "How did you ever contrive to throw so much expression into Virginia Randolph's face?" ex- claimed Mrs. Lynch, after looking at it for some time. "Her features are capable of the finest expres- sion," said Donald, quietly. "And her figure too, I should judge by this. Really, it quite makes me nervous-eh! Melanie? It is surprisingly animated and natural, isn't it?"   TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES.    131 Oh, very!" said Melanie, emphatically, and drawing an involuntary sigh. "I see the story," continued Mrs. Lynch, to whose apprehension this picture-completed al- ready in outline by McAboy's rapid crayon-was level. "I see the story, but can't imagine how you ever got her to act it, or how you could draw it so natural, without that. It is a wonderful art." "She never acted it," said Melanie in 'a low tone. "Well, I believe so, Melanie. So much the greater praise is due to Mr. McAboy's genius. I am quite proud of you, sir." Donald colored again, in his dark swarthy way, and Melanie rose languidly, and walked round the room. Her eyes sought at first the corners half hidden by pictures, or tall canvases designed for future chefs d'oeuvre, or by a drapery thrown care- lessly over a colossal cast.' At one such nook, as she approached it, she absolutely gave a little shriek to see a female form crouching, then blushed and laughed (awkwardly) as a clearer view showed her that it was only Donald's lay figure. At last she turned her eye slowly and shyly towards the door of the innermost apartment, or rather parti- tion, of the studio. "No!" thought she, "that is impossible." She reflected. s I have done him    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6851-00000067"/> 132     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. injustice in my weak jealousy," she said. "He Jaas painted on her picture this morning, I see, but those surprising improvements he has made are due to his own powerful imagination-to his genius, as Josephine says." And Melanie glanced at Don- aid tenderly, and recalled his slight confusion and- tremor in saluting her, attributing both willingly now to that ardent but respectful love-so manly yet so delicate-which he had ever manifested for her. So thinking, and asking humbly how she de- served to be loved so, and, gratefully, could it be wrong; imprudent or unmaidenly for her to return it as she -did, with devoted affection? she moved by a sort of feminine habit, towards the mirror where McAboy's sitters, those of her own sex at least, were wont to adjust their toilette before sit- ting ;-a piece of vanity (which I have heard him say) the browner balance of creation (these artists have curious opportunities of observation) seldom omitted either. Melanie drew near the glass-a fine French plate in an old gilt frame, which Don- ald had picked up at an auction-and true as reality it reflected back her own expressive, feeling coun- tenance, Madame Ruban's finest flowers-though they suited her dark, clear complexion exactly-- were pale to the roses of her cheek; her fine eyes   TO WICH ENTER TWO LADIES.   133 swam with a tender compunction; and as she dropped the lids, to let a soft tear trickle down from each, through the mist and half-closed fringes- of jetty lashes, she perceived on the floor, at the foot of a table that stood close by, a small pink- white glove, with the mould of the hand in it. What a strange revulsion of sentiment that little glove produced in the young lady whose tear- ful eye thus lighted upon it! Melanie picked it up, and submitted it to a close and discriminating inspection. It was spotless white, (save and except the pink shade before noticed,) and not a thread of the sewing was broken; hardly had it a wrinkle to break the smooth mould of the hand which had worn it-not more than once. The silken braid by which it was to be secured at the wrist, was fresh and unworn. A woman does not analyze the process by which she arrives at a conclusion, though it be a fine and subtle chain of argument, over which she passes so rapidly that the result seems like an intuitive judgment to herself as well as others. Whence came that little glove? It never had lain about on the table and the floor, in Donald's studio, amid paint and dust, for twenty-four hours, to be so fresh and clean now. Besides, who sat to him yesterday? Miss Broadband fi'om up the river?-nor -she, nor    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6851-00000068"/> 134     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. her mother, or sisters ever drew on or off a glove like that without tearing it to shreds.-Mrs. Gude- now, (one of Donald's cousins,) whose gloves were so shabby that Josey Lynch dropped her acquaint- ance on that account? Miss Deuil?-the whole family in deepest mourning! No, no! this spotless little, delicate glove belonged to none of them, and to no other but Virginia Randolph, so vain of her hands, and so silly as well as extravagant that she made a boast of never wearing the same pair twice. She had been there this morning, she had sat for that picture, she had been alone, (well might she have exhibited that natural alarm which Donald had caught so perfectly!) She was there still! hiding (0 shame!) in his room. Quite clear and plain Melanie saw how it was. Bonnet and gloves had been, deliberately laid aside at the glass, and deposited on the table. When the visitors came, and insisted on being admitted, the young lady would secrete herself; her "things" were hastily transferred to the hiding-place; and in the haste one of the gloves had been dropped, or had fallen ('twas likely) out of the bonnet, their usual recep- tacle. The start-the proposal to hide-the con- cealment-the running to and fro with the things-- the substitution of one picture for another on the' easel, and turning that on which Donald had been   TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES.   135 engaged, with its face to the wall in an out-of-the- way corner-all this humiliating scene Melanie in fancy saw. How McAboy sank in her esteem! How her pride was wounded, through him, by him! As for Virginia, why Melanie was forgiving, but there are some injuries which women find so many good reasons for not forgiving! All her virtuous indignation was roused by conduct so indelicate, so unprincipled! Open disgrace was its merited punishment, and secret contempt the lightest it could hope to escape with. "Pray, whose glove is this, Donald?" cried she, with her Celtic, frankness, holding it up, and forgetting, in the quick resentment that mantled in her cheeks and sparkled in her eyes, to call him "Mr. McAboy" before Mrs. Lynch.  Whose glove?" repeated Donald, startled by the suddeness and the tone of the question. At the same moment a noise was heard inside of the partition as of something thrown down, that made them all start and look round. "It is the cat!" said Mrs. Lynch, innocently. "I think not," said McAboy. "Something has fallen down; that's all." "I think so too," observed Melanie. "But you don't answer my question, Mr. McAboy,"-still holding up the glove.    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6851-00000069"/> 136     BLONDE AND BRUNET.     r "Upon my word," replied he deliberately, "I never noticed it before. It must have been dropped by one of my sitters." "I will bet you a thousand pair, Josephine, that I know to whom it belongs," said Melanie, giving it a. playful or contemptuous toss, and catching it again, ' though I never set eyes on it till I found it just now on the floor under the looking-glass. I think I will keep it, and return it the owner the next time I see her, as Mr. McAboy might forget." "I beg pardon," said Donald, overlooking a portfolio of drawings in which Mrs. Lynch, uncon- scious of any thing special in the situation, was deeply interested. "The better way would be to hang it up here in a conspicuous place, that the owner may find it the next time she comes." ' It may-be lost, or stolen, or accidentally soiled before that happens," replied Melanie. "It is now quite fresh, and would be a serious loss to a young lady with correct notions of economy; for it spoils the pair, of course, to lose one. I am positive I know the owner. So I will keep it safely till I see her, and then restore it to her." And she reso- lutely stowed away the glove in her muff. "-Perfectly exquisite those drawings are, Mela-   TO WHCH ENTER TWO LADIES.   137 nie," said Mrs. Lynch. "Why don't you look at them? ' "Miss Blake has seen them before," remarked McAboy. "When Xanthine and I sat to him," said Me. lanie, "Mr. McAboy was so kind as to show us all his portfolios." "What a good time you must have had," said Mrs. Lynch, quietly turning over the draw- ings. McAboy stepped back and extended his hand to Melanie-"The glove," he whispered. "Give it me. "-"Why?" she answered, haughtily. "Be- cause I insist upon it," he replied, in a firm, low voice.-"Take it then, sir,"' said she, "from where I found it." She threw it on the floor contemp- tuously. Donald picked it up and flung it carelessly over the partition into the little apartment beyond; and again there was a sound within, but fainter, as of a sudden movement. Virginia, indeed, was all but expiring there in an agony of shame and fear, and Melanie, who suffered scarcely less, did not pity much this wicked rival, but glancing now, at the tell-tale picture fronting her on the easel, now at the door of the partition, (as if wondering whether that creature would dare let them go and leave her there,) drew, as the minutes slipped o P    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6851-00000070"/> 138     BLONDE A  ND BRUNMTE. away, inferences that painted themselves ex- pressively on her scornful lips and crimson-dyed cheeks. At length Mrs. Lynch said they must go. "I am ready," said Melanie. And they went.   CHAPTER XVI. THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE. WITH slow, deliberate steps did Melanie Blake quit McAboy's studio. Scrupulously she yielded the precedence to her matron friend, and a linger- ing glance was that which she threw over her shoulder ere she followed through the green baize door that closed in the painting-room. McAboy went before them to raise the latch of the door giving exit (as we have mentioned) from his apartments on the floor below, by the means of a short private stair. So much he always did for ladies; but it was his custom when Melanie and her sister came, to accompany them as far as Madame Ruban's first landing-place. Habit, and perhaps a desire to be sure of the departure of his visitors, made him do the same now. What thoughts passed swifter than lightning through the mind of the excited and indignant    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6851-00000071"/> 1 40    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE, maiden, the injured woman, the Christian girl, (may I venture to add,) during that brief passage of McAboy's ante-room-more tasteful, elaborate and fanciful in its arrangements than the studio itself-and bile she stood for a moment pausing on the highest step of the cosy private -stair, with one hand lightly grasping her winter dress of rich silk, to prevent its sweeping the steps, and waiting for Mrs. Lynches trailing shawl and flounces to leave the way clear! Fortunate ceremonies of civiliza- tion! Happy deliberateness and dignity in the movements alike of the naked Indian savage in the woods, and of the splendidly-attired children of refined society, which leave them time for reflec. tion! '4 Forgive and you shall be forgiven.' "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy." These sentences rung in her ears, or rather were whispered in her heart. If yonder silly girl had paid a clandestine visit to an artist's studio, (after all a sort of public place;) if, when surprised, she had more imprudently, and with a consciousnest of wrong, concealed herself, (sad want of feminine dignity!) yet was not she too (Melanie) concealing in her heart a conscious affection unlicensed by, unknown to, those who had the best right to her confidence, because they had a lawful veto on her   THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE.     141 inclinations? Nay was there not a tacit, an im- plied, a conditional engagement equally unsanc- tioned, equally secret? Was this honoring lather and mother as her Bible and her catechism taught? Was she not guilty, perhaps, of grter sin than Virginia Randolph, who had neithe father nor mother, (as she had heard,) andwho wronged only herself and her own fame? Was she not, then, justly punished by what this girl had done? What would become of Virginia if she were left there? In what a degrading position with Donald would she stand! How effectually compromised in the eyes of those curious, giggling work-women and shop-girls of Madame Ruban's! 'Twas likely Vir- ginia Randolph's bonnet could pass their door un- observed, unrecognized! Every soul in the estab- lishment knew it, and her, as they knew one another. Did not she (Melanie) hear them laugh, and see them nudge one another, when she and Josey Lynch were made to wait at McAboy's door on their first coming? If they two now went away together, without Virginia, and she afterwards sallied forth alone, what would they think? what would they say? That scandal would speedily circulate in all their own society, and how much it would injure Vir- ginia, if it did not absolutely ruin her in every.    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6851-00000072"/> "2     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. body's. estimation, was incalculable by Melanie- shocked herself, disdainful, pitying, and penitent. She, too, had visited Donald's studio, never alone, (oh, no!) ney^er clandestinely, never without some fair pretex   without conscientiously mention- ingit at hoi: (Heaven forbid!) but oftener than her parents would : approved certainly, had they suspected the true state of the case, oftener per- haps (that was a piercing thought!) than maiden pride should have permitted, considering that they were not formally plighted-only lovers-and one (alas!) by far too fond! Then, when a rush of feminine jealousy sud- denly overpowered all these kind, humble feelings, and the dreadful thought came uppermost (sug- gested without doubt by the worst spirit that ever gained a permitted access to her pure ear) that since Virginia Randolph "had made her bed, she might lie down on it " (as the saying is.)--"Leave her to the consequences of her folly, be it ruin, be it disgrace, or whatever precipice of perdition her unconsidered, witless course may next lead her to leap down!"--"Leave her (since she had made choice of that) to a man's dangerous sympathy, treacherous aid, and (by any woman) ill-trusted generosity! Like lightning these thoughts passed through Melanie's brain. No tongue could have   THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE.     143 given them utterance in ten times so many minutes as elapsed, yet her woman's wit did not miss the clear apprehension of a single one of them. Nor did not this fair Positive remember while her foot actually hovered over the first st escending McAboy's stair, how she and. Xan  last Christ- mas only, at the fair for the Son du bon Pas- teur, besides their own beautiful work contributed, and their services at a well-arranged table, gave a valuable and costly present of their own to be raffled for by their friends, which netted so hand- some a sum for the charity, and they had been- so pleased, and trusted that by the prayers of the bonnes soeurs and their penitents, they should be preserved from the least defilement of those thoughts which are like the mysterious spots of Magellan, that stain the purity of the noon-day sky in the southern hemisphere; and here was she, effacing all the merit of her charity, by a great want of it, to a soul and a fame in danger-of a poor Negative, too, (as the child said to her simple self,) without the light of faith or aid of discipline, who knew not the restraint of confession, nor the perennial supply of extraordinary graces to remedy past falls and natural frailty, nor the sweet inter- cessions of the Mother of purity. "Good God!" exclaimed Melanie Blake, "has sinful passion brought me to this!     <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6851-00000073"/> "4    BLONDE AND BRUNElTE. Mrs. Lynch's sweeping drapery brushed the stair and the lobby-carpet, and the door closed sud- denly after it with a soft slam, from the hook slip- ping by which lMcAboy was wont to fasten it back, but Melanievas gone from the top of the stair- was again in the painting-room.  Virginia Randlh was in the studio, and the door of the inner room where she had been skulk- ing, stood open. She was pale as death; and her brown hair floated wildly on her shoulders, having never been put up since her sitting was interrupted. She nearly fell to the floor when she saw Melanie. "Oh! you've come back to make sure, Melanie Blake!" said she, defyingly, but in a hollow voice. "I am innocent, though-innocent as yourself; proud girl!" added she, rapidly and vehemently. "Put on your bonnet, then, quick, and follow me.  Innocent, I hope and believe you are, but your reputation, Virginia Randolph, hangs by a thread!"Melanie said, with maidenly sternness. "My hair is all down,@" said Virginia, with help- less agitation. "Twist it up anyhow," returned Melanie, in al- most a fierce voice, though low. "It must not be seen so by Josey Lynch, or the worst point of all will be known-your hiding there." And Melanie, with her own hands, twisted her rival's tresses into a knot.    THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE.    ,145 "Oh! you hurt me! Oh, dear! my front hair won't be fit to be seen!" "It is well enough. Only keep your hat on. till you are in your own room-that's all. Now come along. Don't show any agitation ,"d Melanie, softening her tone, and dragging along her still frightened and reluctant compafiion. "What will Mrs. Lynch say?" "No matter," whispered Melanie, as they went down the stair, "It is better to be in her hands than in those of Madame Ruban's gossipping girls." Melanie opened the lobby door, just as McAboy, who was shut out, was going fo pull the bell. "Please to fasten it back," saidhe, without showing any emotion at the sight of Miss Ran- dolph. Melanie did so, composedly, and the two young ladies passed on without more words on either side. Several of Madame Ruban's work-room people were looking with all their might. Aware that the celebrated belle, Miss Randolph, had been some hours up stairs, a thousand questions touching the solution of that fact had been raised and discussed among them. For some time, indeed, it had been believed by most that her sister, or some other friend would drop in by appointment before the sith 7    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6851-00000074"/> "6    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. ting was ended. This party gained in strength by the arrival of the other two ladies, and lost again  terribly by their being obliged to ring twice for ad- mittance. Miss Randolph's stock was held at a mere nominal value while Mrs. Lynch and Miss Blake prolonged their visit. When tokens of their approaching departure were perceived, the market rallied a little; the bulls-admirers of Virginia or grateful to McAboy-waxed confident, but one frightful bear-an exceedingly proper young lady of a certain age, with a particularly ugly expres- sion about the mouth-declared that if Miss R. didn't come down with the others, she would ask the young ladies themselves whether they had seen her: so natural did Miss Randolph's actual behav- iour seem to some of her inferiors in station, and not those with whom she would have been best pleased to be associated. But the young ladies now swept by together in silent dignity. McAboy followed just to the land- ing of the next flight--his accustomed stopping place with the Misses Blake-and said, "Good morning, young ladies." "Good-bye," said Mela- nie, simply, and looking up earnestly at him for a moment. "The next time I sit," said Virginia, tremulously, but trying hard to laugh, "I hope Bella will be   THE MAIDEN'S REVENGE.     147 able to come, though you know she is so impatient that it is dreadfully tiresome." "You have been very patient to-day," answer- ed he, bowing a last bow over the bannisters as Melanie disappeared, and Virginia Randolph just nodded her head in answer. At the entrance of the show-room on the next floor a couple of saucy sales-women, in neat French made dresses and with waspish waists, were watch- ing for their coming down, and Melanie's heart sickened within her to think of the idle propos- the nest of venomous scandals-which her own gen- erosity had crushed in the egg. "I never meant to do! any thing wrong, I pro- test, Melanie," whispered Miss Randolph. "I will own the candid truth. All that I thought of was to, get one sitting when you wouldn't be there. You know you always contrive to be present when I sit. Belle asks Xanthine to go in her stead,- and then you come, you know, with Xanth." "Why did you hide?" asked Melanie, regard- ing her curiously yet coldly. "Because, after I began to sit, and was all alone with Mr. McAboy, and he was so-I don't know what-so contemptuously polite-just like you-and I saw that he did not care a straw except for the picture, then I felt how wrong itiwas, and    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6851-00000075"/> "8    BLONDE AND BRUNEE. that he despised me, and I would have sunk in the earth if I could." "What on earth are you waiting for, Melanie?  cried Mrs. Lynch from the carriage. "Get in with us, Virginie, and we will set you down," said Melanie, with genuine kindness. Miss Randolph, too, liked to be called Virginie. If Melanie had told fifty consistent lies she could not have deceived Mrs. Lynch so perfectly as by this simple act, look and tone of a real friend. "Paying more visits to Madame Ruban?" she said, as Miss Randolph yielded, very willingly, to Melanie's invitation. "Oh, what extravagance! What is the Easter hat to be, Virginie Y?" mimick- ing Melanie's manner, and laughing mockingly. "I have not chosen one yet," answered Miss Randolph, blushing. "She would have ruined herself but for me," said Melanie, gayly; "but I carried her off by main force." "Don't tell!", exclaimed Miss Randolph, with a look of violent apprehension. "Not I!" said Melanie. "Your hair bears witness that you have been trying on bonnets," observed Mrs. Lynch. "I suppose it is all in a blowze," said Virginia,   THE MAIDENS REVNGE.     149 very naturally. She had breeding, though not sense. "You have found an owner for the glove, Me- lanie," said Mrs. Lynch, with a careless smile, see- ing Miss Randolph at that instant drawing it on with great assiduity. "Why, Virginie! you must have sat, then, this very morning, to Mr. McAboy. Have you been at Madame Ruban's ever since, trying on those bonnets?" "The time passes so quick when one is engaged as you have been, tell her, Virginia," said Melanie, rather cruelly. "Like it did when we (or rather I, Melanie,) were looking over McAboy's portfolio. Do you know how long we were in that studio, child? An hour and a half, as I am a sinner. It did not seem to me that we had been there above three-quarters -did it to you?  "It seemed an eternity to me," thought Vir- ginia, saying it to Miss Blake with her uplifted eyes. "A word in your ear, Virginie:--excuse me, Josey," said Melanie, when the carriage stopped before Mrs. Mortimer's, and Miss Randolph got out. Melanie put her face close inside the latter's bonnet and whispered--"Don't tell any lies, Vir- ginia-they will only get you into a scrape-but    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6851-00000076"/> 150     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. keep your own counsel-and-and-don't, for Heaven's -sake, go there again as you did this morning." "Oh, you may rely on that-I give you my word and honor, Melanie," said Virginia, and with a sudden movement kissed the other young lady (their faces being so near) several times. "That is very edifying," observed Mrs. Lynch. "What mysterious sympathy have you found with Virginia Randolph, Mel? Do you know I strongly suspect that she had no company this morning but her own wise self in McAboy's studio, when she sat for that surprising portrait? You blush at the idea, Mel, but I can remember when I was wild enough to have done such a thing if I hadn't had the fear of being obliged to confess it before my eyes. Telling forty fibs (that did nobody any harm,) wouldn't get you such a lecture you know." "My mother has always taught me not to fib," said Melanie. "Your mother was bred a Negative," replied Mrs. Lynch, laughing. "I always insist you owe half your virtues to that, Mel. A poor Positive born, like me, goes on fibbing and confessing to the end of her days, and is always in the very dust of humiliation, while you are riding the high horses of truth and just self-complacency. Well, I   ;THE MAIDEN'S RVENG.       151 must say, Melanie, Hnever saw anybody look so lovely as you have done, ever since you came out of Madame Ruban's doorway, to this moment. How anybody can compare such a girl as Virginia Randolph to you! I never saw her look so well as she did just now, though her hair was all in a blowze; and then it seemed only the reflection of your spirit and sweetness. I allow she has a fine showy figure and regular features; but no expres- sion. Her taste in hats is execrable. The one she wears now is splendid to be sure, but wholly un- suited to her age and position. It would become me or Mrs. Leary on some dress occasion, but not her. You .smile, but maidenly simplicity of dress is a great sign of the same trait in the character. You are a hundred times handsomer than she is, dear. And your slim, chaste figure (forgive me, darling-it's the only word) is a thousand times more dearly winning than her voluptuous embon- point. Any man of real purity and refinement would feel and say so. And your truth! Talk of fibbing-you could not deceive me, Mel, if you tried. That candid face would peach with its honest blushes." "You praise me so much more than I deserve that I am ashamed to put in a disclaimer," said Melanie, looking down with an expression half demure, half contrite.    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6851-00000077"/> 152    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. When the carriage turned for the second time that moruing'but of Crayon Place into the Blooming Way, (after setting Virginia Randolph down, you know,) Miss Melanie Blake could not help a glance at the corner store. Donald stood on the walk, in the gray cool shadow of the winter afternoon al- ready declining; a plaid wrapped in the true high- land fashion over his breast and shoulders. He was evidently going to his usual resort (since the improvement in his fortunes)-the Crayon House just below--a magnificent pile of Italian architec- ture in white marble-to take his dinner at the ladies' ordinary. He saw the carriage and raised his hat. What a picture he was of the calm, con- summate, superior man of genius, in the first enjoy- ment of a hardly-earned success! There was no artistic affectation in his costume, and yet he was picturesque. Nobody would take him for a mer- chant or a lawyer. Leisurely he walked down the square, yet keenly observant. A beggar and her child on the step of the hotel arrested his atten- tion :-she was picturesque in her rags. He spoke to her, pointed to his rooms, and gave her a shilling. "Ever on the watch," thought Melanie, "for knowledge or materials! Ever kind to the poor! but as if it were a matter of business. No osten- tation; no sham. Is he not, then, 'a man of real    THE MAIDrENS REVENGE.    153 purity and refinement' after all? Oh, I cannot think so, for else he would not love me, who have none of that voluptuous beauty, as Josey Lynch says, which he thinks is the only kind ' capable of the finest expression;' as he said Virginia Ran- dolph's features were. But what an unscrupulous devotion to art, to peril a silly girl's reputation and let her stain her conscience, and turn both to profit for the sake of getting a beautiful drawing or making a successful picture! Such dreadful self- ishness!" I7* *    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6851-00000078"/> CHAPTER XVII. A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT. To pursue the metaphor which we have used before, the stream of Melanie's love, as well as her sister's, in its approach toward the place of the fall, had now arrived at a rapid, where it flowed be- tween steep banks, in a narrow channel much obstructed with rocks, dangerous to the frail bark that danced on its bosom in the shape of an earthly hope. One may indeed wonder where, all this time, were the eyes of their mother, that failed to mark a thousand circumstances which should have be- trayed the state of both her daughters' affections. It would have been surprising anywhere but in Gotham, during the season of gayety. Of all the rights secured to the inhabitants of that city by the constitution and laws, none was better ascer- tained or more indefeasible than the right of flirta-   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.     155 tion prescriptively enjoyed by the young of both sexes in the intercourse of society. Xanthe, ever since she was allowed to mix in society, and even before that, had used it liberally, and her mother observed with pleasure that she had never been so reserved as this winter. Gay, animated, friendly she was with everybody, but particular with none, unless a certain shyness toward Mr. Tremaine on several occasions, contrasting with a modest and silent delight in his graceful attentions at other times, was being "particular." This was a sort of flirtation-a manner of being particular with one person-which this good mother apprbved, sup- posing that the person were all he should be; and Mrs. Blake, it must be admitted, was herself rather partial to Mr. Thomas Tremaine. He was very amiable, she said. So he was. She liked him bet- ter than Mr. McAboy, whose name was distasteful to her from old associations, and who seemed to her female, motherly eye, a selfish person, though talented. She could weave a sort of romance of hope and. kind feeling about Tremiaine; she felt only fear and some aversion towards his cousin. The former's want of religion (a want which might be supplied) was the only objection she had to him; the ambitious, determined, wilful character of the latter was not atoned for in her estimate by    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6851-00000079"/> 156     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. his genius, and she would scarcely have been recon- ciled to it had he been of the "true faith."- Mrs. Blake did in fact express to Melanie her opinion. of Donald quite plainly and at large. "If one of my daughters," said she, " (which Heaven forbid,) were going to marry a Negative, he is the last person I would wish her to choose." But at that time Melanie had formed no sort of engagement, not even of a conditional kind, and she only blushed at her mother's remarks, combat- ing them faintly, and admitting in part their justice. She thought Mr. McAboy was too wilful, and she would dread trusting him  with her happiness; which was the exact truth, and therefore deceived her mother. Mel was so prudent, Mrs. Blake com- placently observed, she would look out for herself, she would weigh people in pretty even scales. But Mel had a great deal more of sustained enthusiasm than her mother dreamed of. Celtic ardor and Yengeese * steadiness met in her firm, quick-feel- ing nature. Neither did her father comprehend * We read in certain old histories that the Indians of the North called the English colonists "Yengeese" or "Yengees" (the s soft,) which modern use has corrupted into Yankees.

Of the probability of this we leave our readers to judge.-[-ED   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.    157 her strength of purpose, nor her mother her passion- ate susceptibility: a compound of them both, she was a mystery to each, and the more because each thought they understood her perfectly. Patrick Blake; Esquire, did not trouble himself much about the state of his daughters' hearts that busy winter. In January he was attending to his balances, and never had they been more favorable. As the spring opened, he was engaged in extending his business more than it had ever been extended before. The only paternal anxiety that interfered with these absorbing interests, was that which he felt on account of his younger son Harry,.who was too intimate with certain young bloods of Gotham, and neglected his duties in the counting-room; Mr. Blake particularly reprobated his close con- nection with that idle, foppish Tremaine, of whom, from certain pecuniary transactions between him and Harry, Mr. Blake had a very low opinion; Tom having borrowed of Harry so considerable a sum as $100, which he somehow neglected to pay at the time he promised when he borrowed it. So far from paying, indeed, Tom had let Harry foot the entire bill of a sleighing excursion they made together, and had never talked of refunding. - Hal wasobliged to mention these little circumstances in applying for more findsmdeed mentioned them    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6851-00000080"/> 158    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. in pure ingenuousness, and Mr. Blake was very lib- eral to his son, as he always was, but he formed and expressed an opinion of the friend the reverse of favorable. On the other hand Mr. Patrick Blake thought highly of Mr. Donald McAboy. When Donald fit- ted up his rooms in the summer with so much taste and yet so much economy, he incurred a debt, which when the bills Were presented he was able to discharge only in part, and he accordingly cov- ered the principal account by giving his note at three months. At the period of maturity he was still short of funds to meet it, and was consequently obliged to seek out the holder, who chanced to be Mr.. Blake, to get it renewed. McAboy was ex- tremely annoyed that the note should have fallen into Mr. Blake's hands, and that he should not be able to pay it, but he called on that gentle- man, manfully stated his difficulty, and requested time. "Have you any other notes out, Mr. McAboy?" asked Mr. Blake. "I take the liberty of inquiring, because you see, if I don't let this note be protested (in case you can't pay it) the endorser will not be held." "I have no other note out," answered McAboy, after a moment's hesitation and reddening at this   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.    159 unusual catechising; " but I have other debts, sir.. I owe my tailor at this moment, and when rent-day comes I shall owe my landlord; unless I am so for- tunate as to sell some pictures or paint some por- traits before then." "Oh, very well," said Mr. Blake, smiling slight- ly. "I discounted this note to oblige the endorser, who is my tenant. How much have you got on it? One third, eh? Well, count it out, and fill up this blank note for the balance at sixty days. I will send round to the bank, for the other note meanwhile.  McAboy was determined not to ask for a re- newal of the second note, so he went to his tailor, who had sent in his bill, and represented to him that it would be for his interest to take a note at four months rather than lose his future custom; he made his landlord take a three months' note for his quarter's rent, and having thus staved off these claims, he was able, by strict economy in his per- sonal expenses, living in his studio on the simplest fare and dining at a laborers' eating-house under one of the markets, to take up the note to Mr. Blake, when it fel" dae, out of the proceeds of some landscapes which he sacrificad at an auction. When the portrait of the sisters was finished, Mr. Blake asked McAboy for his bill. Donald    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6851-00000081"/> 160     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. made'answer that he could not receive anything for the picture, as he had requested the young ladies to sit, for the sake of the opening it would give him to get other business, and that he wished Mr. B. would accept it as some acknowledgment of his kindness about the note. "Whew!" said Patrick Blake, " you paid the note, Mr. McAboy. As you please, sir, however- I know nothing about pictures myself, but Mrs. Blake and the girls are wonderfully delighted with this portrait, and I shall be pleased to pay whatever you say it is worth." Upon reflection, McAboy wrote out a bill for the portrait, and Mr. Blake gave him a cheque on the spot. The amount, agreeably to Donald's prices as he had determined to fix them when he saw how well the portrait took, was exactly equal to the amount of the note which he had paid. Being thus in funds, he went immediately to his tailor and landlord, and took up the notes he had given them; and it so happened that his doing so, became known to Mr. Blake, who laughed and said that McAboy was destined to get on. Only a few weeks after, Donald opened a bank account, and by some natural method, "as luck would have it," (Tremaine subsequently observed,) Mr. Blake got wind of this too, The mode indeed was very simr   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.    161 ple; for Tremaine being ashamed to owe Harry Blake any longer, borrowed of McAboy, who drew him a cheque for the amount, which Tremaine gave Harry, and the latter, delighted that his friend had poneyed up so honorably, showed it to his father with Tremaine's name on the back. All these little matters contribute to decide men's fates. But by this time Donald's prosperity was a fixed fact. Mr. Blake heard of it from various quarters, chiefly through the conversation of his own family. McAboy's patrons and sitters were frequently men- tioned in one way or another-Mr. De Grotius, Mr. Seijas, the Mortimers, the Broadhands, the Deuils, the Gudenows-all people that Mr. Blake knew something about. Young McAboy had ob- tained a "good business connection," it was evi- dent; it needed no longer a prophet to foretell that he would get on. He had got on. I am digressing as usual, but really my story, though simple, has so many threads that it requires some dexterity not to let any of them slip. I left Melanie Blake in the carriage of her friend Mrs. Lynch, going home with that lady to dine and spend the evening, and reasoning with herself by the way on the subject of Donald McAboy's self- ishness as displayed in his behaviour towards Miss    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6851-00000082"/> 162     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. Virginia Randolph. She remembered how firm and resolute he had been about the glove, forcing her (morally) to give it up; then how he had tossed it over the partition into his sleeping-room, almost confessing Miss Randolph to be secreted there; and she was inclined at first to blame him severely for this part of his conduct; but on the whole she concluded that it had been only honorable at the same time towards Virginia and herself. First, he could not suffer her to carry off Miss Randolph's glove, to distress her, to detect her, to be a proof against her: that was plain. Next, as he read her suspicions, it was his basiness to disarm them by frankness, in which she felt that he had succeeded. Her heart acquitted him of infidelity to herself, but not of cruelty to the simple-minded-say, weak-minded-Virginia. True, she could not tell how strong the temptation might be to an artist, to study one so beautiful, under the excitement of a terrible feminine fear. She had heard of paint- ers committing murder in order to watch and seize the expression of the dying in their agony. No doubt the passion for, this kind of knowledge was imperious, but would she like to commit her hap- piness to the hands of one who had yielded himself to it? Then she reflected how all men and all women have their passion, and should one judge   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.    163 another hardly? But Donald must be made sensi- ble of the wrong he had done, he must repent of it, and promise never to do so again, or she would give him up.  These thoughts made her so dreamy at dinner, that Washington Lynch rallied his fair guest, and vowed she was in love, wondering who the happy man could be that made Miss Melanie Blake so distraite and absent. In the dusky, fire-lighted drawing-room, Melanie sat on a low ottoman, straight as she ever sat, (Melanie never lounged or leaned,) thinking with all her might, while Mrs. Lynch dozed on a sofa close by, where that lady had lain down with the professed intention of chat- ting a great deal. The point was definitely pre- sented to Melanie's mind that she might be com- pelled to give up McAboy. Oh, in that case what a blank was life! She had often thought that the lonely fate would be hers, but never before had it looked her so drearily in the face, as now that for several months she had felt a deep and fasci- nated interest in another, and had indulged the hope that her earthly existence might be woven together with his, that he might in his difficult but heroic course, be cheered by her constant love, and she participate by sympathy and the nearest human tie, in his fame. To be other than the wife of an    <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6851-00000083"/> 164     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. artist, or of any artist but Donald, was out of the sphere of her possible fancies now, touching wed-* ded happiness. To be married to a merchant, though ever so rich; to a lawyer, though ever so eminent; to a literary man, if he were as gifted as Scott, and as successful in winning gold with the pen; did not seem to her devoted and faithful heart things that she could possibly contemplate with any satisfaction, even if she were heart-free again. No, only the lovely works of the pencil, interested her deeply and nearly; only the wife of an artist she wished to be. To think, therefore, that Don- ald was unworthy of that devotion, was to lose the sun out of her world. Melanie turned the fact, or the idea, over and over in her mind, and the more calm and still she was, the more keenly the anguish pierced and cut, dividing the heart's tenderest and most sensitive strings. "I cannot give him up," cried she, to herself, let him be what he nay, let him do what he will. Woman was made to suffer, and I will suffer. And yet if he will not see, if he cannot feel, that it is fearfully wicked to despise the soul of any body, and to tempt it and to corrupt it, he and I cannot breathe together- " Tea was brought in. Mr. Lynch had finished his cigar, and came in too-a richly bearded gen-   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.     165 tleman, with long auburn hair that flowed in a thousand curls on his broad shoulders. His superb wife awoke, and they grew lively over their tea. Melanie exerted herself to be cheerful, wherein a conscience more at ease than her's had lately been, greatly assisted her, Mr. Lynch had challenged her to backgammon, when the door-bell resounded, and presently the servant ushered in Mr. Donald McAboy. Washington Lynch glanced roguishy at Melanie and welcomed the visitor heartily, say- ing, "'Now our party is made up. Will you take a hand at whist, McAboy?"-"Fie, Washington, you forget it is Lent," said his wife.-"Is it against the rules of the Church to play cards in Lent?" asked McAboy.-"No," said Washington, "but as I do nothing else to observe it, (I can't fast,) I ab- stain from whist. I really forgot that; and back- gammon too is excluded by my resolution. What shall we do, McAboy?   Miss Melanie, propose something."-"I propose to go home and say my prayers," said Melanie. "' You have reminded me of the duty," This was treated as nonsense at first, but Miss Blake was as resolute as young ladies generally are in what they set their hearts on. "Are you in earnest?" cried Mrs. Lynch, when Melanie insisted on going up stairs for her bonnet.-"Positively," ------ ----b -I YIVIII II UVC CI VI-LLV V  L V*IVI VLJ )    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6851-00000084"/> 166    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. said Melanie.-"But what reason do you give? Does your head ache? Are you sick of our com- pany? Is Mr. McAboy dsagreeable to you? If he is, we'll soon send him about his business."- "Oh!" cried Melanie, " let me go this time with- out any reasons, please. I want to go, but my head doesn't ache, and I am not sick of your com- pany, nor is Mr. McAboy disagreeable to me in the least, I assure you."-"How on earth do you expect to get home?" asked Mr. Lynch.-- 'It is a clear, moonlight night," said Melanie.-"I beg your pardon, the moon is down already. Isn't it more than a fortnight to Easter? How can there be moonlight?"-"Well, it is clear and dry, and the streets are lighted with lamps," said Melanie. "-I suppose that you or Mr. McAboy will have the kindness to walk as far as Santaklaus square with me, for which my papa will reward you with a glass of wine." In short there was an opportunity to secure a tete a tete walk, and Melanie profited by it, as any other young lady in her position would. If she had waited till nine or ten o'clock, one of her brothers'would doubtless have dropped in to play her escort, or Mr. Lynch would have ordered his carriage again to the door-the Lynches had been abroad and affected old world manners. "But if   A WALK NOT Bl? MOONLIGHT.   167 you really prefer a walk on this bright moonlight night, (a fortnight before Holy Thursday!) " ob- served Washington, sarcastically, "and will go now in such an unguestlike manner, why McAboy, 'I see, stands ready, hat in hand, to assert his claim as a bachelor to attend you." "Of course," said McAboy, smoothing the nap of his hat very indifferently. By the way it was the first time she and Don- ald had ever walked home together in the evening from anywhere. "When such privileges," thought Melanie, tying on her bonnet, " are open to any girl who chooses to avail herself of them, how can any body wish to step beyond'the bounds of our honest liberty? I shall take Donald's arm, shan't I? I shall say to him what I like, and nobody will be tie wiser--will they? And all the world may know of our tote a tete-mayn't they? What do 1 want more?  As soon as they were in the street, McAboy said, without waiting for the trembling Melanie to begin as she fully intended,-  "Melanie, you are an angel, and I am a cold, selfish, wicked man. I am unworthy of you, noble, generous girl! I know that too. But forgive me, I pray. Overlook my unworthiness. It is your sweet, your holy influence that is to teach me bet-    <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6851-00000085"/> 168    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. ter things." (The men are always so penitent when they've something to gain.) What could Melanie now say? So frankly to confess his fault-that proud Donald! Without being asked-without being scolded! Surely he was full of real generosity! What did she do. She wept. He saw it by the bright gas-light (for it was clearly impossible to get up a moon at that point of Lent) from the shops in the Blooming Way. "Dear Donald, if you knew how unhappy I have felt to think you could possibly act in so cruel and (forgive me) so unprincipled a manner.' "Say on, Melanie. I deserve it all." They reached Santaklaus square, but I'm bound to admit that owing to the interesting nature of their conversation, they missed the most .direct route, and, as if they had meant to avoid the short cuts, went round by secluded Chit-chat Street, in- stead of vulgar Slip-slop Avenue, so bright with second-rate, cheap stores; and thus entering the corner farthest from Mr. Blake's house, walked, without any particular hurry that I could discover, nearly once round the Central Park on their way to it. Yet Santaklaus square was not bright with shops, but gloomy with tall private mansions, with a street lamp here and there to make the darkness visi-   A WALK NOT BY MOONLIGHT.    169 ble, and the great leafless trees of the park (cour- teously so termed) were not so charming a prospect that one would care to make the entire circuit there- of to see them to better advantage by that imper- fect light. At last, however, they did arrive (if they had minded what they were about, they might have done so much sooner) at the door: they mount- ed the steps; McAboy rung the bell, and notwith- standing he was going in with her, thought it ne- cessary to take a ceremonious leave of the lady, who seemed to be pleased with that mark of his respect. "He kissed me on the steps to-night, dear moth- er," Melanie said, tears flowing fast from her eyes and falling in the maternal lap, "and I did not ob- ject. I may never become his wife-I never will unless you and pa consent-but no other man shall ever do the like, as none ever did before, except pa and my brothers." Auribus attonitis percepit mater amorem. Which means that the gentle mother was con- founded. So was I, who had (but that is no mat- ter) other views for the eldest Miss Blake.

WE must not forget poor Xanthine altogether. Her affairs too at this time were drawing to a cri- sis. A chief reason why Mr. Thomas Tremaine was so anxious to return the money he had (to do him justice) reluctantly borrowed of Harry Blake, so that as we have seen he not only got McAboy to lend him the amount, but actually and faithfully paid it over to Harry, (much as he wanted it for other purposes and hard as it was to part with money,) was that he had made up his mind to pro- pose to the youngest Miss Blake. During that sensible girl Miss Randolph's passing bewilderment for him, Tremaine had wavered a little in his fidel- ity to Xanthine. Well, Miss R. hadn't half the fortune that rumor assigned as the future portion of Mr. P. Blake's daughters; but then she had it in possession, and a bird in the hand is notoriously   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMED.  171 worth two in the bush. Her beauty, her style, her connexions, were superior to those of the Misses Blake. Or if they were not superior) they were so considered, which amounts to the same thing. Miss R. was one of the F F F.'s, or first families " of Dominia, as I have before mentioned; her father (he was killed in a dueD was a member of the Co- lumbian Senate and a planter of tobacco, as well as a great breeder of black cattle, of the species called chattels personal, for the market of Granded Levee, the Southern sugar State-a most respect- able pursuit, far more so than selling Yengeese ker- seymeres and Celtic linens in Gotham like Mr. Patrick Blake. Tom wavered, I say, and well he might. Indeed, if he were to marry Xanthine, unless her father would come down with the dust at once-settle something on her--it was not clear to Tom's mind how he should support her till such time as it should please the old gentleman to " kick the bucket," as he was accustomed to express it. Miss R. had ready money--a thing for which Tom's exchequer gaped hungrily and constantly. But then, again, was it enough? Was it, in fact, as much as he had a RIGHT to expect? Tom had a turn for calculation, which he in- herited (the only thing he did inherit) from the McAboys. Miss Randolph was said to be worth    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6851-00000087"/> 172    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. fifty thousand piastres d'Espagne, (I hate to use any unpoetical word in discussing these delicate affairs,) from which Tom coolly deducted ten thou- sand for exaggeration. The remainder, supposing it invested at the usual rate of interest in Gotham, would yield an income of say three thousand a year. "I ought to have more than that," said Tom. It would have been little, in truth, to live on in Gotham and keep up any sort of style. They couldn't keep a carriage; they couldn't entertain; not on three thousand piastres per annum, they couldn't. "And if V. should have a family, which is sure to be the case when you don't want 'em," Tom said, "that state of things would soon de- generate into poverty. We should have to go into the country and raise our own garden-vege- tables. I'm not mercenary," thought he. "Haven't I let slip two or three real rich girls that I might have had as easy as winking, because they were plain or vulgar or something of that sort? I con- sider beauty and lady-like manners essential. Mrs. Thomas Tremaine must be a person that I can like, and need not be ashamed of. Ah, now, if that dear little Xanthe only had her eighty thousand (it won't be more) standing in her name in good City of Gotham stocks, I wouldn't hesitate a mo- ment. With an elegant quiet income such as that,   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMED.  173 and such a charming, fresh, affectionate creature to share it, I would not only be content but happy. What a good girl she is," mused Tom,-"how modest and pure-minded, with all her budding life and warm feelings! I should be delighted now to see her fondling a baby in a lace robe, and I would  love her and her children dearly." That was the cxact state of the case. Tremaine really loved Xanthine Blake, and it was only the consciousness of his pecuniary necessities which re- strained him from speaking out. Could he have proposed to Mr. Blake to pay something down with his daughter, he would have done so, but it was not possible to put it in that shape. His course of conduct in hanging round Xanthe, and winning her affections, when this was the case, was unmanly, I allow. It was infamous, some may think. He was a despicable fortune-hunter, some may say. True, but he was no worse than a hundred others, and I really think he was about the best-natured fellow in the world, and the very best specimen of his class. "So much the worse for his class!" say you, indignantly; and I heartily respond "Amen " to that. But when Miss Virginia Randolph (whose or- phanage and majority put an undoubted amount of convertible securities at her own disposal, and thereby strongly tempted the highwayman of good    <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6851-00000088"/> 174     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. society)--when she turned crazy for his gifted cousin,-Tremaine, naturally disgusted with her fickleness and nearly cut off from all hope in that quarter, resolved on not incurring the risk that proverbially attends the experiment of sitting on two stools, and renewed his attentions most deci- dedly to Miss Xanthine Blake. That young lady received the truant rather coldly at first, although she had been nearly heart-broken by his desertion and notorious flirtation with the beautiful Virginia; but Tremaine had a thousand excuses for the seem- ing inconstancy, enough to make it appear almost heroic, and Xanthine was credulous and placable to the last degree. Poor Tremaine! a delicate sense of poverty had kept him back, had sent him away to amuse him- self with a forward, silly girl that he never could really care for: it was a pure act of desperation. He was a lawyer by profession, Xanthine knew, and it took ages for lawyers to get into a self-sustaining practice. [What was the reason, then, that Brad- ley Alford, Tremaine's partner, had already a wife and two children?-for the Alfords lived on their share of the common business of the office, where Tom was seldom seen.] And Xanthe said it was all the more romantic for that to marry Tom. Surely his rich uncle James would allow him something,   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMED.  175 and her papa would give her a portion on her wed- ding-day-nothing surer: they would get along for a few years on that. Ah! Xanthine! don't count on what those few years may bring forth! Don't speculate in most distant wise on the day, inevitable though it be, when the kind paternal ,heart shall ceaseto beat, and somebody or other shall adminis. ter before Bradley Alford, Esq., or whoever shall in those days be Surrogate of Gotham, on the estate, real and personal, of Patrick Blake! Youth too, O Xanthine, is mortal, and many are the chances to which thy sex is subject. Wife and mother thou mayest lie in the grave dug by an untimely accident, ere that gray head shall fall with slow decay in the ripe autumn of life. Mark, I say not this will be so with thee, but yet wed rather, I pray, some honest man with a stout arm and a willing heart for labor, who may support thee and thy babes, (if heaven send them) with his daily toil in the woods and ploughed fields of the new and fertile land where thy lot is cast; eat together the bread of industry-it may be earned in ten thousand ways: tell Tom Tremaine to set to work in his office, all lined by his uncle James with tawny octavos, instead of sauntering on the Blooming Way speculating on heiresses and hankering after the effects of their prosperous papas, who have no mind to leave this world- yet    <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6851-00000089"/> 176     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. awhile. Papa-Blke has no intent to quit this sublu- nary sphere, I can tell you, notwithstanding that his religion bids him set his affections on one above the moon and stars; and although there is a precept which says, give to him that asketh thee, he by no means understands it as applying to such a trust as a lovely and innocent daughter, or to so large a por- tion of his worldly goods with her, (dross though it be,) as would suffice to maintain an idle fop like Tom Tremaine in elegant style! Nevertheless, Mr. Tremaine determined to apply for the situation of husband to Mr. Patrick Blake's younger daughter, to which he trusted that a suffi- cient emolument would be attached, to enable him to live in affluence for the remainder of his natural life, The duties of the post he expected would be light, as they would consist chiefly in spending his wife's money, and teaching her how to make her- self pretty, and to cut a genteel figure in the world; he was sure he was competent to the task, and Xan- thine's docility, aptitude to learn, and great admi- ration of himself, would render it agreeable; and upon these qualities, as well as upon her beauty, sweet temper and social talent, he reflected with great complacency in considering that one unavoid- able condition was that he should be tied to her as long as they both lived.   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS- ARE RESUMED. 1" So, by one-of those coincidences which frequent- ly occur, as the young men had formed the acquaint. ance of the girls on the same evening, on the same evening it was, while McAboy was receiving -from Melanie the most sacred promise which a young per- son of her age, without the consent of her parents, could give, and sealing it with so tender a seal, which a delicate mind would consider irrevocable, (as she did,) Tremaine too was cutting short his am- biguities, and instead of fine compliments and soft gallantries, that Xanthine was bound to treat as nothings, or frank confidences and glimpses of his affairs that implied every thing, but which she was not at liberty to seem to interpret so, put his fate in her hands. Xanthe was at home. She might have been spending the evening with Mrs. Leary Mortimer, after a day of shopping and calls, as Mel was do- ing with Mrs. Washington Lynch; but Xanthine was keeping Lent very strictly. I speak of Lent and Easter for the easier understanding of my readers, but of course the Gothamites had proper names for these things in their own language, or perhaps I should say the things rather corresponded to what we are familiar with in the world, than were the same. I might make Mr. Lynch, for in- stance, talk of its being only a fortnight to Pas, 8*    <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6851-00000090"/> 178     BLONDE AND BRUNEITE. (pronounced porse,) at this time, but who would comprehend that? It had done Xanthine a world of good, Tom's shameful shilly-shallying and incon- stancy. It came very near a case of heart-breaking, I own; Leary Mortimer's trifling conduct never hurt her half so much, for all the wet pillows and red eyes it cost her; the contrast to the happiness of her sister Melanie in Donald's noble earnestness and frankness, aggravated the case now, and be- sides, there was a piercing of the conscience, which her innocent credulity as to Leary's intentions had never caused, not when she blushed for it most painfully. She had no mother now to soothe her with, pity, no sister to share her indignation and exceed it: for her mother did not know the bird was wounded again, and to Melanie she was careful never to olyn that the arrow had penetrated this time, and that the barb was left in the tender, bleeding side. In her agony-for it was fairly that-Xanthe flew to religion. Now, the truth is, that woman is made for love, conjugal and maternal, and when the powerful sentiment which seeks this necessary com- pletion of the end for which she was created, has once been awakened and then disappointed, you cannot put her off with sermons and prayers, and a round of filial or sisterly duties. She craves   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMED.  179 the food of love. Husband and children are now become necessary to her moral organization, or it faints and dies, or else the sweetness of her loving nature turns to acrid vinegar, or worse, to death by poison. If religion cannot give her these things, it need not try to help her. The purest virgin that ever gave the model of womanhood in its ideal ex. cellence and untainted snow, was wife and mother both. Single blessedness for woman is a monstrous falsehood. Old maidhood is a wretched, pitiable condition, to which the most unhappy marriage would be vastly preferable, as life, though wretched, is better than annihilation. But happily, in the faith that Xanthine professed, (whatever fault I may find with it,) woman was treated as woman, and whether it were by some divine wisdom, or by a rare human sagacity and policy, (as my friend De Grotius used to contend,) the idea of a spousal re- lation, of which the earthly was only the symbol; of a maternity most real, most exquisite, and full of joys and sufferilgs; had there its constant type, which enabled the simplest mind to understand it; and though her weak heart, like Xanthine's, might be incapable of the highest form of renunciation which this blessed marriage implied, still its virtue instilled into her bosom, and in a lower step of that heaven-ascending ladder taught her to rest,    <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6851-00000091"/> 180    BLONDE AND BRUNErTE. and- look upward with eyes consoled though tearful. In the pastures where she fed grew a bitter herb, of which she ate, and if it did not quite heal her wound, it diminished the pain and inflam- mation, an'd put it in a fair way for a healthy reso- lution (as doctors say) in time. Xanthine was at home that evening, I say--a good place for a woman to be. Papa and mamma Blake were at home. Her brothers were at home. The younger children were old enough not to be sent to bed with the chickens. A safe, happy place for a young woman is the family fireside. Xanthe is not quite so rosy as she was in the purple autumn, nor so plump and apple-cheeked. Her silk robe decks a slenderer figure than her neat print used to fit, when she gathered the blue clusters from the trellis, at Red Fort, standing on a kitchen chair to reach them, the children below holding a plate or basket to receive the superb grapes. Her father noticed that Xanthe was thin, but she was not thin. Tom Tremaine could have told him that. She was only more refined. Tom was right. The blue eyes a little hollow, but soft and tender; the cheek a shade more delicate in tint and outline, the throat less warmly rounded and caressing, the drapery flowing in gentler curves, told a tale, but it was a   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMEIr. 181 pathetic one; and what Xanthe had lost in the physical perfection that a votary -of the antique like McAboy admired, she had gained in the heart- touching traces of suffering sweetly borne, in the soul peeping out, in feminine dignity and in thought- ful grace. Xanthine was happier now that she had resigned herself, but she never was herself again wholly, even since that rough gale had blown over and calmed down. The lightsome and beautiful craft showed marks of the weather she had encountered; she was not so fresh and bright as when she left her port. Papa Blake wondered what made his gay, good-humored girl so sad; for indeed the sad- ness was more marked since its cause had ceased, as Xanthe took less pains to conceal it, and if she were accused of melancholy, laughed cheerfully and frankly, and said she thought of taking the veil. But this particular evening she was unu- sually merry, quite as much so as was either be- coming or na ural during the most solemn fast of her religion; her cheerful voice ran on; her laugh broke out silvery and sweet. It was all about mere nothings. You could not have remembered any thing that was said for five minutes afterwards. Much of it was at the expense of her elder brother -"Pat," she called him (he always wrote his name    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6851-00000092"/> 182     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. "P. Bailey Blake ")-who was playing some very lugubrious music on the piano in the next room, with a very pleasing degree of skill. In the midst of this, Mr. Thomas Tremaine was announced, and Xanthe se tut, as the French say, or, as her little brother freely rendered it, "shut up;" in good English, held her tongue. Tremaine was not much in the habit of coming alone in the evening. It had enough, of singular, his doing so, to make Xanthine's heart jump at the sound of his name. Papa received him with his droll, ,Celtic courtesy, polish mingled with humor; mamma was invariably most kind to Tremaine, and he liked her extremely; Harry was always glad to see Tom; Pat Blake, junior, came away from the piano, greeted the visitor with politeness, and conversed with him as much as good manners required; the two younger Blakes, boy and girl, showed that perfect self-possession which is so char- acteristic of the young Gothamites; little Miss Kitty, in particular, who was not yet out of panta- lets, was as graceful and ceremonious as a grown woman, in welcoming ' Mr. Tremaine." Was Xanthine glad to see him? Indeed she hardly knew. All would see that the visit was in- tended for her: it was an avowed act of courtship -the first; and while talking to Tremaine, her eye   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS ARE RESUMED.  183 roved inquisitively to her parents, to her brothers, to-watch for slight tokens of the way in which they regarded it. That was all her present anx- iety. She did not foresee, nor Tremaine either, that all that full domestic circle would silently melt away and leave them alone. Papa Blake found he had letters to write: he did not like Tremaine, and thought he left enough behind to entertain him. Kitty Blake and Frank conformed to a custom of theirs, and the one in a huge arm-chair, the other with his head on the table, sunk into a state of oblivion to all earthly plays, cares, and loves. They were huge pets, having come into the world so long after their brothers and sisters. Pat Blake took up Kitty in his arms, her head and fair long hair drooping on his stout shoulder, and bore her to some upper region of warmth and curtains and snowy pillows, where somebody was found to stow her away, properly for the night. Harry performed the same kind office for Frank, and as it was not strictly the maid's duty to put such a great boy to bed, good. natured Hal did that too. Pat, not caring greatly to return to the drawing-room, went into Frank's small room and talked with Hal, during the un- dressing operation upon the passive brotherling. While Mrs. Blake was telling Tremaine how kind    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6851-00000093"/> 184     BLONDE AND BRUNETE. her older sons were to each other and their sisters, and to the younger ones, and Tom was thinking, quite touched, that domestic life and good parents and loving brothers and sisters, and all that, " was a capital good thing," (and Tom had never seen much of it himself,) who should come in but a re- spectable man-servant, and say in a very defer- ential tone,-"Mr. Blake begs to speak to you for a moment up-stairs, ma'am." "'Excuse me for a moment, Mr. Tremaine," said Mrs. Blake. "Mr. Blake cannot find his ink- stand, I presume." "If that's all, it's in my room, ma!" cried Xanthe, with/a blush. "Let me go." But Mrs. Blake was already gone, and Xanthine could not leave their visitor absolutely to his own reflections in the scarce a moment ago well-peopled drawing-room. Tremaine seized the occasion. In a hundred years could he hope for a better? Everybody was absent longer than anybody intended. Nay, the door-bell rang, unheeded by the busily occupied groups up-stairs and down; the respectable man- servant let in McAboy and Miss Blake, who, after some delay, timidly entered the drawing-room, where, by the cheerful fire and soft moon-like lamp used by the rich Gothamites, sat Xanthine and   XANTHNE'S AFFAIRS are RESUMED.  185 Tremaine, the former all covered and veiled with roses that grew in her own garden, the finest that ever bloomed, and the latter, as if he'd been rifling them, looked a little apprehensive and guilty, like a cat found in the milk-pantry, and yet radiant too (the fellow was) with the purest and most honora- ble happiness (to do him justice) that he had ever enjoyed.

WHEN Mr. Blake discovered that his inkstand was missing, his first thought, in truth, was to ac- cuse Xanthine (so well were her habits known) of purloining it. It had happened before that the same useful article (without which a writing-desk is nearly useless, though well furnished in other respects) had been taken away in the course of a morning, and subsequently found in Xanthine's apartment, with a copy of verses under it very likely, (the child having a turn that way,) verses which in many cases came to be read afterwards (being usually more comic than sentimentaD for the amusement of the family. Consequently, without making a disturbance, the good, indulgent papa proceeded straight to his younger daughter's room, a snug little piece on the story above, but one that boasted few conveniences   MR. BLAKE USES IMPROPER LANGUAGE. 187 for writing, (if one had much of a literary turn,) being destitute of a fireplace, for example; a dis- advantage compensated for other purposes, by a comimunication with Melanie's larger apartment, which enjoyed the use of one, at this season freely replenished. Here, to be sure, on a small table, Mr. Blake found his inkstand, but nearly minus ink, a circumstance for which an unsightly dark spot in the nice damask table-cover, as if somebody had had the mischance to overset the stand in their haste, sufficiently accounted. First taking note by the aid of his candle of the low state of the ink, and then glancing round with the peculiar dis- satisfaction which this discovery invariably pro- duces, the worthy papa, a little vexed with his Xanthe, observed of her carelessness several traces which at another time he might have overlooked, or deemed no subject of his animadversion. Two at least of the drawers of her pretty walnut dress- ing bureau were gaping, and in one of these a paper caught his eye, scrawled over, in a feminine hand, with lines that evidently were verses. To tease Xanthe by the seizure of her MS., seemed to her father a very suitable punishment of the slipshod habits which had left it exposed. He drew it forth, therefore, and with no more scruple than he would have inspected a drawing    <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6851-00000095"/> 188     BLONDIE AN  BRUNETTE. of Melanie's, perused the following lackadaisical lines: "Beat on, my heart, by treason well-nigh broke! Weep still, mine eyes, your traitor's late return; Bend low, my head! to take love's half-'scaped yoke; My breast I half-cooled, with ancient ardors burn! "Oh weakest heart I that canst not him disdain, Who made mine eyes such floods of sorrow pour; Ah, silly neck! to take that yoke again, Which might have made me burn forever more. "Good lack! how shall I e'er at peace arrive? Which way I turn, disaster hems me round. I die outright, except my love do thrive, tWhich thriving gives my soul a mortal wound. "O teach me, some good Power! the way to find, Kindly to love, yet to myself be kind." This silly rhapsody at first reading made Mr. Blake laugh, but as it had, after all, a certain mu- sical flow in its conceits, he read it again, and re- calling Xanthine's late melancholy and loss of flesh and color, he began to think that it might perhaps be a picture, not much exaggerated, of her feelings in regard to somebody; and with that he began to be displeased at the verses.  Not being so fa- miliar with the conventional language of poetry as his daughter doubtless was, he was even so unrea-   MR. BLAKE USES IMPROPER LANGUAGE.  189 sonable as to blame the use of such words as ( ardors" and ' burning" in a young lady's com- position, not considering that these were consecra- ted forms of expression to describe feelings which, as the writer experienced them, were certainly as pure, and as consistent with perfect modesty, as any feelings could be. Who the person was, alluded to in such pointed terms as a "traitor," it was natural for Mr. Blake to suspect; and he had asso- ciations (as we are aware) with the individual, and with his name, which roused his indignation at the bare idea that such an one should have trifled with his daughter. Scarcely against any one could stronger objections exist, and he was glad at any rate to see that Xanthe was sensible of one of them; for in no other sense could he understand how "her love's thriving" should 'give her soul a mortal wound," than as implying the danger to her salvation from marrying a Negative, andan irreligious and worldly one at that. In short, Mr. Blake repaired to his own apartment again, taking the paper with him, and having sent for his wife, as we have already seen, (at the least favorable min- ute he could have chosen, though the most for- tunate for our friend Tom,) saying nothing to her about the exhausted inkstand, he put the poor little sonnet- before- her, with-"What is .all this      *    <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6851-00000096"/> 190    i BtONDE AND BRUnmCETTy. stuff, Julia, that Xanthe's been writing? Can you tell me what it means?  "It is rather pretty, said Mrs. Blake, after read- ing it; "I did not think the child could write half so well." "And I thrust ye admire the sentiment, Jule, as will as the stoile o' composeetion," said her hus- band, in a richer accent than usual. "Begad!" (but that wasn't the expression he used) "an' if you do, it's what I don't!" "Dor&amp;'t swear-don't-Pat dear!" said Mrs. Blake, in a tender, imploring voice. "The senti- ment is borrowed no doubt, my dear. Xanthe reads an immensity of poetry in those British clas- sics of yours "-looking up at a set of some forty elegantly bound little volumes in the book-case over the escritoire;-- this is imitated from some of those old writers; you may see it is, by the heathenish turn at the end; very likely it is just copied from one of them." "May be it's copied," said  her husband gravely, "but I warrant Xanthe thinks it suits her own case, or she wouldn't have taken the throuble."  "Ah well," rejoined his wife, "it is an exag- gerated expression of the way she may have felt at some passing disappointment. La! I remem-   MR. BLAKE USES IMPROPER LANGUAGE. 191 ber, Pat "-smiling and laying her still fair hand on his shoulder-"I remember when I was in the depths of despair about a Mr. Tremaine," (Mad- am's voice sank a little though,) " who had jilted me, you know, and three months after I thought it was the most fortunate circumstance of my life- and I think so still, Pat Blake!" added she kiss- ing him with tears in her eyes. "You know it as well as I, ye bihunagh," * imitating his brogue. "Ye're a sinsible woman, Julee" said Mr. Blake, submitting to the caress with the grace of a half roused lion, when the dear lioness pets him-" but" -with a mixture of humor and determination in his gray twinkling eye--" look after-your daughter, I beg, for I'll be "-(here he made use of another expression too shocking to repeat)-"I'll be dashed if any body called Tremaine shall ever have me darling child to ruin and maltrate and neglict." Dear Pat-my dear husband-be calm. What is the use? There is no danger, I'm sure." "He is a lazy spendthrift, like his father before him," said Mr. Blake. "Let us hope he won't turn out so," replied Mrs. Blake gently. "Ana a Nigative!" says her husband. "She'll lose her soul, as she says. No child of mine, with Bikunagsh, thief, used as a term of endearment.    <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6851-00000097"/> 192     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. my consint, shall ever marry out of her own bless- ed faith. I did it, but two wrongs don't make a right. There, I've set down me fut, Jule." "Well, Pat," said his wife, "I agree with you on that point perfectly, and that reminds me--" (bethinking herself how she had left the young people together)--" that I must go back to the dwing-room." So Mrs. Blake, without thinking it necessary, in his excited state of mind, to explain the why to her husband, returned with all speed to the draw- ing-room, to secure as effectually as she could the stable door after the beautiful filly was stolen. And here I can't help observing that Mr. Pat- rick Blake was very ill advised to use profane lan- guage, because his daughters, he feared, were going to disregard their religion in another way, perhaps a good deal less wicked and dangerous. It occurs to me to ask whether a swearing father (their religion forbidding to swear) would be like- ly to impress his children with a profound sense of the necessity of letting that religion exercise a veto power over the indulgence of their innocent affections. What else could he expect, indeed, than that those daughters in due time should wed "out of their blessed faith," (as he said,) in whose behalf,   i MR. BLAKE USES IMPROPER LANGUAGE. 193 before bringing them into the world, he himself had made no stipulation that they should be so much as bred in it, and that while he was giving them a mother who was not of it. And if the risk were so great to their salvation as he pretended, why did he expose them to a greater? It is like- ly enough that Mr. Blake consulted, in this instance, for his daughters' children, rather than for thesm- selves; but I own I see more pride than piety in the resolution that no grandchild of his should be a "Nigative" by any chance, when he bound him- self to be-no matter what (something dreadfuD -rather than they should run the remote or prox- imate risk of such a fate. Blake was a good man in the main, and a good Christian, I allow. He never swore but when he was in a passion. I don't suppose that he would be sent to Gehenna merely because he talked of it too lightly; but if anybody who is a particular saint infer the likelihood of some temporal punishment following such peccadilloes, I have nothing to say. Oh, Pat Blake! in several ways you are in for it; and I apprehend that the time has come to make you suffer a little, through your natural pride as a father, your prudence as a man of the world, and your kind old heart. But why should we care any thing for the 9    <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6851-00000098"/> F   In 194    BLONDE AND BRUEITE. feelings of old Blake, when he stands in the way of younger heroes? It is not the way of the world at present, and I do not wish to be out of the fashion. Let the old folks, then, stand aside, and give the young ones a clear stage for their struggles, their sufferings, their pleasures and their or the same reason I should pass lightly over cene between Mrs. Blake and the younger daughter, the surprise and consternation of the former at the strange and inauspicious concurrence of events, when, on Melanie quitting her, after the tearful interview of which I have afforded a glimpse, Xanthine, in her turn, came in, with a nervous tap and a whispered "It's I, ma;" and flinging her arms round the maternal neck, cried, " Oh, dear mother, if pa and you please, I am en- gaged to Mr. Tremaine !" "Engaged!"    How little the young maid knows, or regards the tremendous interests involved in that one word. Not only her own mortal and immortal destiny, but that perhaps of the genera- tions of which her plighted bosom is the germ, turns on it. The future is as long as the past, for all we know, and that blushing girl may become, like Sara or Rebecca, the mother of mighty nations. Kings may spring from her soft pledge; heroes,   MRB.

Time was when woman could reach no higher dignity, which is only represented by that of queens, but which belongs equally to every blue-kirtled peas ant that listens to the tale of love whispered through a cottage window. Surely, unless women sweetly consented, as they do, to become wives and mothers, the world would come to an end, (and small fun would there be ther in writing books, with nobody to read;) for the stream of humanity is always flowing through theii wedded hearts; but better it should come to at end, and the stream disappear in dry sand, that that the idea of woman herself, in her perfect eter nal state, should be lost on earth, giving place tc the sensual dream of the spiritual rapper, or the degraded hope that cheats the Mormon.    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6851-00000099"/> 196     BLONDE AND BRITE. And therefore it is, that, (seeing there is a re- source, and woman needs marriage neither for her highest dignity here, nor to secure her admission to Heaven hereafter,) I wish they would exercise more discretion in using that modest power of con- sent which nature and the laws of God and man have given them, following reason as rational crea- tures, and piety as heirs of heavenly bliss, not in- clination or fancy, like the poor pagans who adored a host of gods and went hopeless ad inferos, or the modern infidels and illuminati, who believe not in any, or, what amounts to the same thing, consider each transient longing of their own corrupt hearts as an inspiration and a command of the Supreme.   CHAPTER XX. BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS. NEVERTHELESS, I do care enough for the feel- ings of the respectable-father and mother in this case, to record how Mrs. Blake could not or would not keep the double secret confided to her, even for a single night ; how she made her husband par- taker in it, and robbed his pillow of all sweet re- pose. It came upon the old man like a thunderbolt, that both his daughters were not only attached to Negatives, but actually plighted to them. One alone it would have been comparatively easy to deal with, but to seem to tyrannize over them both was hard. Moreover, there was a great difference in the two cases, and yet it would be very difficult, and seem very cruel, to make one. " That McAboy," said he to his wife, " is a young man of great promise. He has talents, he has in- dustry, he has notions of business, he pays his debts   <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6851-00000100"/> 198    BLONDE AND BRUiNaE.- and keeps accounts. If he were only not a Niga- tive, I'd not object to Melanie having him. But the other is a humbug-a poor-spirited crayture, who'd be contint to live on his wife's money in idle- ness and dissipation." At breakfast next morning-both girls were ex- tremely affectionate to their old father, putting their arms round his neck and kissing him with mighty fondness; but he scolded and growled and acted otherwise in a very improper manner, show- ing that fathers ought to be got under betimes by their children, or in the end there'll be no bearing them, they're so positive and despotic. Indeed, before the matin meal was over, Mr. Blake did, in a most indelicate way, which nothing: but a defec- tive early education could excuse, before all the family, blurt right out his opinion of the case in hand, and the way he was determined to settle it; and Xanthine cried and hid her face, and Melanie, pale and haughty, rose from the table and walked to the window. It might very well be that the light and unsatisfying nature of the Lenten break- fast for the older members of the family contrib- uted something to this outhreak, a circumstance which the young ladies, with their usual supply of buckwheats and foamy tumblers of milk, did not consider sufficiently. Young people seldom have   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.   199 much consideration for the old, nor people who are full for those who are fasting. Old Blake went hungry and irritated to his counting-house, as Xanthe loved to call it-his store, as he called it himself. His daughters retired to their rooms, where Xanthe cried herself sick, and Melanie, who did not weep, and never complained of her head- ache, seemed to lie sullenly on her couch, idle and silent, pale and proud. But I have heard her say, long after, that people were very unjust to her iny thinking so, for the fact was that disappointment and wounded feeling made her bilious,-it was her constitution, and preventing the process of di- gestion, caused the buckwheat cakes and milk to lie heavy on her stomach, and in short produced a violent attack of dyspepsia. The proper homoe- opathic remedy is chamomilla. The headache, as she described it to me, was " throbbing and violent, with a dreadful pressure over the eyes and a horrid uncomfortable feeling in the occiput." All pro- duced by her father's shocking behavior that morning, and the desecration of her love for Don- ald by that unfeeling parent, in speaking of it be- fore her brothers, and " even, little Kitty." There need be no wonder she felt it. "t Do you think it was fair or kind, Mel, to speak of our being so extraordinary religious as to choose I                , ,     <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6851-00000101"/> a c  200    -LONDE AND BRULETT. Lent for our 'amatory arrangements?"' cried Xanthine, with red eyes. "Could we help it? Can Negatives, like Mr. McAboy and his cousin, be expected to pay the same regard to Lent that we do? When such a serious proposal," added Xanthine, "was made to us, could we answer 'Wait till after Easter before you speak of these matters?'  Would they not have thought we We-tare making fun of them? Or else that we were a pair of hypocritical pretenders? I am sure they W-,; br-s would." "Perhaps not," said Melanie, in a constrained voice. "Our religion is nothing to them, but they know or ought to know that it is every thing to "Do you think we were wrong, then, in that?", "I don't think any thing about it," answered Melanie, shortly.   4 "How cross you are!" said Xanthe. "'Well, dear Xanthe," said Melanie, "my con- science has told me all along that I was doing wrong in being so interested in Donald, and listening to his secret suit, but it doesn't prick me much, be- cause I took a day in Lent to repent and tell ma all about it, and send Donald to pa for his leave -to.--  Melanie did not finish, her voice being choked by a dreadful rising in the throat,   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.   201 It was really lucky for Donald that he did not call at " pa's counting-house" (to adopt Xanth's elegant phrase) until about the hour of noon; Mr. Blake, the clerks said, was just gone to lunch, which McAboy considered unfortunate, as he would lose an hour by it, but that was surely better than to lose his suit. Mr. Blake returned in three-quarters of an hour, having consumed some eight ounces of biscuit and raw oysters, with a glass of tolerable 'stiff brandy toddy, a thing that notably disposes to kind social feelings. He was quite another man, and being delighted to see Donald rather than Tre- maine, sheok hands with the young artist almost cordially, offered him a cigar (which McAboy took) and inquired after his health, as if he hadn't a daughter in the world. It was not his part, in- deed, to be aware of Donald's business, until the latter broached it. It is noteworthy, by the way, that when you call to ask people for any thing, they never anticipate you, although they know perfectly what you are after. McAboy was not sorry, as it gave him an opportunity to make his approaches in the manner which he judged most likely to en- sure success. He had brought with him his account book, wherein, with true McAboy punctuality, he had entered all his receipts and expenditures since he It   '      9* I i    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6851-00000102"/> 2,02-   BLONDE AND BRUNETrE. came of age,all according to the system of double entry. He wanted Mr. Blake to do him the favor to run his eye over it. The account was minute- ly accurate, and regularly balanced once in six months, although the credits in one year (the last that Donald was abroad) did not exceed the mag- nificent sum of $295. On the first day of the cur- rent year the balances indicated that McAboy was then even with the world, though without a shot in the locker when his washer-woman's bill was settled,* not leaving a penny, as he laughingly said, to pay the book-keeper's salary. Since then, the debits to cash had gone on increasing in amount and fre- quency, showing a steadily advancing income; and lastly he exhibited his bank book written up to the close of the preceding week, with a clear surplus of $497 on the first quarter of the year, standing to his credit. "At this rate," continued McAboy, "my total income this year won't fall short of $3,000." "If ye want to invest," said Mr. Blake," I'd ad- vise the Pequcd Mills Manufacturing Company, in the State of Penobscot. I'm a large stockholder myself. Pity you didn't drop in an hour or two, earlier. Me old and highly respicted- friend, the Hon. Plato Vernon of Shawmut, President of the Company, was here, and would have given you   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.   203 every information. He thinks (and he's a very cautious man) that in two years the Pequod will divide eight per cent. semiannually." But Donald proposed to invest his spare funds for the present in a shape more attractive to a young man than the stock of the Pequod Mills. He point- ed out to Mr. Blake that his position allowed him to marry.-"Oh, that's well," said Mr. Blake. "A young man can't do better. Ye're not far from thirty, Mr. McAboy."-"Seven and twenty," said Donald.-"Very good-very proper age."-"And I am ardently attached to a young lady of twenty summers or thereabouts, as she gives me to under- stand," pursued Donald, smiling.-"That's all very well, and very suitable," said Mr. Blake, gravely.- "Our attachment is mutual," continued Donald, "and has been in existence some months, though not so openly avowed on the young lady's side till now; which has not been owing, however, to any want of explicitness on my part. My admiration and the serious intent of it were as plainly confessed to her six months ago, as I have stated them to you, sir, this moment. I need hardly say that I mean your daughter, Miss Melanie Blake, sir."--"I am very sorry to hear it," said Mr. Blake.-"I hope not," says Donald.  There was a brief silence, which Mr. Blake broke.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6851-00000103"/> 204     BLONDE AND BRUNiTTE, ' I am aware of Melanie's attachment to you, Mr. McAboy.

It seems to be the way of this country I am very much obliged to you for the honor you, do our family by the proposition, and I'1l say can- didly, that in every respect but one I consider it a highly eligible one for my daughter; but what that objection is you know, Mr. McAboy, as well as I do. Religion, sir, is the most important thing in life.. If you Were of our faith, I'd give my con- sint with the greatest pleasure in the world."' "You married a Negative, Mr. Blake," says McAboy. "I did, sir, but my example is no rule for my daughters," replied Mr. Blake, warmly, "and it's one I don't intend them to follow." * "If I were hostile to your religion, or preju- diced against it, there would be some reason in that objection," replied Donald. "But there's no rule that does not admit of exceptions, sir. I have -the highest respect for the ancient Church, sir. It was the first, and they say it will be the last. I would never interfere with my wife's religion." ' Something more than that is requisite," an- swered Mr. Blake, quickly, hastening to make a declaration that he hoped would conclude the dis-   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.   205 cussion, as in most cases it would. "Except on one condition the Church disallows such marriages altogether, and except with that condition, I am firmly resolved no Nigative shall iver marry one of my daughters with my consint, as the consint and sanction of the Church they can't have, and I don't believe Melanie or Xanthine would be so undutiful and so impious as to marry without both. All the children, of both sexes, without any distinction, must be brought up strictly in our faith. The he- retical party (excuse me, sir) must solemnly prom- ise that, or the Church forbids the banns, Mister McAboy." "Is that all? I agree to that condition with the greatest pleasure," cried McAboy, eagerly. "Nothing would annoy me so much, I assure you, as that Melanie's conscience should not be entirely satisfied in her marriage. And as respects the case of children," added he, in a deep voice, and with his dark, ruddy cheek flushing, "if Heaven should bless us with them, by whom could they be taught religion better than by a mother? And of course she would teach them her own. Brothers and -sisters, too, should be of the same faith. I should always go to church with Melanie, if I went anywhere; and in fact, sir, I've not crossed the threshold of any other kind of church but yours    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6851-00000104"/> 206     BLONDE AND BRUNThTTE. these five or six years. Artists are not very re- ligious, but the music and the pictures were always attracting me into your temples when I was abroad, and here I go nowhere. That's all right, sir, I hope." Mr. Blake now felt himself in an unpleasant position for the salvation of his-- consistency. Here was a young man of high moral character, (though no religion,) of eminent talents, distin- guished in an art that was a source of both wealth and fame, a youth of thorough business habits, in the receipt of a handsome income already, and far too clever and industrious to lose it, fondly at. tached to his daughter, and she to him, willing to make every concession on the point of religion that -  - the Church herself required-what more could he ask-? He could not help remembering that Me- lanie, with all her personal attractions and fine character, had never had a suitor before. Either she was despised for her religion, or feared for her wit and quick perception of the ridiculous, or un- popular for her shy, proud manner. "The girl is j  more than half Yengeese," said her father, "our Celtic boys don't take to her, nor she to them. Some are too plain, like her old father; some are proud, silly daws that must needs strut about in the borrowed plumes of the native peacocks :--Mel   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.    207- laughs at the latter most of all. And this McAboy is a sweetheart that any girl may be proud of, any how. It is curious," reasoned Mr. Blake, "that our two kinds of people would each rather choose out of the other for mates, if this bar of religion were not between. But for that, the two races would flow together and mingle like two confluent strames." Personal liking, too, has a great influence. Don- ald's physique was agreeable to Melanie's father, as it was to Melanie's father's daughter, no doubt. There was something in the cut of his head and figure that told of the old country; he had an honest, plain, earnest style of face, belonging to the Caledonian Celt; his complexion, though deep- ly embrowned, was not sallow like this Western people's; clear was its tinge of red, and pure white the brow where the hat had protected it-a com- plexion of the old isles. Mr. Blake loved it, as was natural. The reflection which decided Melanie's father was the same that decides so many similar cases in the humbler walks of life. It was doubtful whether, being the girl she was, she would ever have another such opportunity of being married to her mind. For if she was attractive, she was difficult; if she was rich in expectation, she was of an unpopular    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6851-00000105"/> O8     BLONDE AND BRUNETE. religion; few t"Nigatives" would consent so readily as McAboy to those strict conditions (notwithstand- ing their obvious tendency to promote the mere temporal happiness of the new family, which was going to be formed of partly discordant materials); and last of all (deeply to be considered by one who knew Melanie) her virgin affections had now been once bestowed; they would neither bear easily to be taken back, nor be given elsewhere without pain and self-dissatisfaction, and loss of their first delicacy and freshness. It was more than likely they never would bloom a second time, if they were now cut Town to the roots. The plant was too delicate for that kind of treatment. "Well, wait till after Easter, Mr.- McAboy. We must talk to Melanie seriously, and set before her what she is going to do. Her spiritual director must have his say on this important point of con- duct, that is to decide her whole life, and perhaps the next life too. In the mean time I will-be obliged to- you," said Mr. Blake, who, when he chose, spoke as pure English as any body in the world-almost, "not to attempt seeing my daughter. You will do me the favor, that is, not to visit our house till you hear from me again." "That is hard," said Donald. "At least allow me one more interview, before you try to change   BOTH BOATS IN THE RAPIDS.  209 Melanie's mind-just to assure her of my fidel- ity. "' No, no! no interviews!I replied Mr. Blake, with a sagacious shake of the head. "You may write any thing you like, in an unsealed note, which I will deliver." Donald colored, but sat quietly down to a desk and wrote-  "87 RUBY STREET, Friday. "DEAREST MELANIE, "Till you take the veil or wed another, "I remain, "Faithfully yours, "DONALD. "MISS ELANIE BLAKE, "Santaklaus Square." Having offered this to her father, who perused it, Donald tucked it neatly into an envelope, ad- dressed and sealed it, and handed it to Mr. Blake. So he went away, having absolutely forgot to say a single word (as he had promised) in behalf of Tom.    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6851-00000106"/> CHAPTER XXI. YOUNG GOTHAM HOLDS A COUNCIL. WHEN Mr. Blake said that Melanie was half Yengee, he might have reflected that this was a consequence of a choice which he had made with deliberation, and yet with passionate eagerness, some thirty years before. And the remark might have been extended to Xanthine, although in her the Yengee element was more latent, and it re- sulted (as we have before observed) that those who knew only-Yengee or Celtic character, could never calculate on what either of those girls would do in given circumstances. I am far from thinking that this was a disadvantage to them, all things con- sidered; it threw around them a delightful mys- tery; it perplexed you, it gave you frequent sur- prises, and it certainly narrowed their power of being perfectly satisfied, inasmuch as they required a combination of different qualities, and could   YOUNG GOTHAM HOLDS A COUNCTIL.   2" judge according to two widely different standards. On the surface, Melanie was more correct and self- balanced, Xanthine more impulsive and careless; but in the depths of their characters, when they were fairly stirred up, Melanie was warm-hearted and passionate, while Xanthine in the same circum- stances was capable of exhibiting a firmness, or obstinacy, if you like, that no one would have sus- pected. This was the fair and spirited team that Mr. Patrick Blake had undertaken to drive, and which he was bound, indeed, to conduct in safety over a perilous road, winding down a mountain pass, by the side of dizzy, bush-clad precipices, with a roaring torrent (as we've said before) of youthful passion dashing on at the bottom, and wetting the short turns of the zig-zag with the spray of its frequent cascades. The " illigant cray- tures" themselves are fairly excited with the dan- ger and the rapid descent; to give them their head, or to hold them in, is an equal risk; if they take the bit betwixt their teeth, as is likely, we shall have an upset, as sure as I'm alive. Indeed, I meant this for a merry story, and I fear it is going to turn out a sad one. That is nat- ural, at least; for (as the admired satirist, Whack- away, would say) there never was a laugh yet but it was paid for by a groan of agony from some    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6851-00000107"/> 212 -   BLONDE A-D BRUN1TX T - wrung heart or other,-never a smile but its rosy tracewas soon washed out by the trickling of a bitter tear. McAboy and Tremaine, as we hinted at the close of the last chapter, were not long in discover- ing how they mutually' stood with the sisters, and they consulted together freely as to the best mode of proceeding with their suit. "What provision do you intend to make for the support of your wife, Tom, when you have got her?" inquired McAboy, not in the old sarcastic vein, but kindly. Well, I suppose the old gentleman will settle something handsome on Xanthine, when she's mar- ried," quoth Tom. ," Don't be too sure of that," returned Donald. SNothing in the world more likely than that be- sides her outfit and wedding-gear, the bridal pres- ents and so on, which will rather entail expense than lessen it, she wont have a penny from the old man at- present.' If you take his daughter, he'll expect you to maintain her, depend upon it. For my part, I don't want any thing with Melanie but herself. I love my future wife for herself alone, and I expect the greatest pleasure in earning her daily bread as well as my own," concluded Donald. Tom -was silent, as they moved along the night-   YOU** GOTHAM HOLDS A COUNCIL.  213 gloomy Blooming Way, rendered so by the closing of the gay shops and the disappearance of the street-passengers. He was ruminating on the ab- solute impossibility of his doing any thing of the sort. Yet why was it impossible? Why couldn't he do what McAboy did? Donald had a year or two the start of him in life, but in their professional careers Tremaine had the lead. "Donald has genius!" sighed Tom. The thing of all others, Tom, without industry and practical judgment, to ensure speedy ruin or endless embarrassments! "What is your income, Tom, if I may be so bold as to -ask?" demanded Donald, his cousin's silence continuing. "Rather indefinite, I confess," said Tremaine, candidly. "It don't support me alone without running in debt, and how it is to do for another, in the style Xanthine and I are accustomed to live, puzzles me." "Still let us look at it," said Donald. "Come up into my rooms and we'll talk it over." They went up McAboy's now dark and silent stair, passed Madame Ruban's doors close-locked and shuttered, and that of the working-rooms above in the same state. In the studio they found warmth, and in an instant, light. McAboy got pencil and    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6851-00000108"/> 214    BLONDE AND BRUNEITE. paper, and sitting down by his shaded gas burner, demanded the items of Tom's income. "Well, in the first place there's the office-the law partnership of 'Alford and Tremaine;' we divide equally." "And work unequally," said Donald. "Last year my share was eight hundred pias- ters," Tom said. "But out of that I had to pay three hundred to a clerk to do the copying and engrossing for me. Alford does his own." "You can save that expense as well as he," said Donald. "Work nights, Tom. Be independent, man! In a year you'll be obliged to keep a clerk fo-r this extra drudgery, just as I'm going to em- ploy a young fellow of some promise to paint back- grounds and draperies for me. Set down the office income at eight hundred. What next?" "I am a Commissioner of Deeds," said Tom. "That would be worth about four hundred more, if I was to attend to it." "Attend to it, then, and make it worth four hundred. What more? The governor allows you something?' "He allowed me to lend him a cool fifty last Easter," said Tom, laughing, "which he has never paid to this day." "When you are married, Tom, you must stop   YO GOTHAM HOLDS A COUNCIL.    215 lending to the governor," replied Donald determin- edly. "It is written that the fathers should lay up for the children, and not the children for the fathers, and that a man shall leave his father and mother ahd cleave unto his wife. I'm all for going according to Scripture in these things. Well, there's uncle James, what does he do for you?" "James McAboy, Esq., gave us our law library, and paid our office rent the first two years. Since then he has lent me two or three hundred piasters, which he carefully enters in his books, so that it will have to come out of whatever he may leave me in his last will and testament," Tom said. "You mustn't count on uncle James. If you were getting on, he would do something handsome for you, no doubt;-pay your rent or furnish your house. But it appears, Tom, that by merely at- tending to your business, and doing your work yourself, you will have a clear income of $1,200. 'Fore George! Tom, if you can't live with Xanthine on that, you don't deserve to get her-that's all." "If I wasn't so sadly behindhand," groaned Tom. " I'm like Sheridan, my good fellow-I 0 every body." "That's unfortunate," groaned McAboy.-- "How a fellow can be in debt who has had a clear $500 a year, and has lived with his uncle, board-    <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6851-00000109"/> 2.16  . = BLONDE AND BRUNIT:If  - fiee, as you have with uncle James, (wonder if he charges your board on his books, to be deducted from your legacy?)-I say it passes my comprehen- sion.

"Oh, -- it!" cried Tom, "they'd hardly pay the bill of the stable-keeper." "Sell them and pay his bill, then. Come, give us the debts.

"They neither eat nor drink, and you would part with them at a great sacrifice. Though you will never be able to play on the piano, Xanthine will, and it will help to furnish your house. The books ditto. You won't read them, but she will, and   YOUNG GOTHAM HOLDS A COUNCIL.  217 may be the time will come "-glancing at Tom, in a peculiar way-"' when she'll need them." By a close calculation it was found that the curricle and bays would fetch enough to pay off all Tom's debts, except those to his uncle and cousin, the former of which would arrange itself in time, and for the latter, Donald said, laughing, I will make your wife a present of the I. 0. U. on her wedding-day. But you must show what you can do in the way of industry and economy in ad- vance, Tom. Let us see you save the first quarter's income, (as you can easily do,) and working like a beaver to make it as large as possible: then, and not till then, shall we know whether this $1,200 is a fact or a mere figure on paper." "I am so dashed unused to industry and econo- my-fine words-hard things!" quoth Tom. "It all depends on how much you love Xan- thine," returned his cousin. At that Tom swore he would do it. He loved Xanthe to distraction. He would work; he would save. "You'll never marry Xanthe unless you do, if I can prevent it," said Donald, resolutely, tapping the table with his pencil. "If, on the contrary, you can achieve such a conquest over your own indo- 10    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6851-00000110"/> 218    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. lence and habits of expense, I engage that you shall marry her." The young men discussed the matter more at length, and Tremaine gave the strongest promises. MoAboy undertook to communicate Tom's affairs and resolutions to Mr. Blake the next day, when he made his own formal proposals: for he was afraid Tremaine would spoil his own cause, and he perceived that their causes were closely connected. He considered that Tom should not seek an inter- view with Mr. Blake, to demand Xanthe's hand, until he had settled the debts. t"I will send the carriage and bays to Cattlestall's to-morrow," Tom said, quite inspired. "There is a sale at 12 o'clock." "That's lucky," said Donald. "Depend upon it, it will make a good impression when the old man hears that you have begun by selling your horses." But as we have seen, in pleading his own cause, McAboy forgot to say a good word for Tom.   CHAPTER XXII. IN WHCH THE STORY ADVANCES SOME FURTHER. IT was a more difficult thing for our friend Tom to dispose of his phaeton and bays to advantage than any one not used to these transactions would suppose. Still he was determined to sell; it was cutting off an expense anyhow; and to the hammer they went, at Cattlestall's, that very morning, and although they brought scarcely half what he had given for them, (and the carriage was every whit as good as new,) it was enough to pay the stable bill, and leave something handsome over. With a cheque for $200 in his pocket, Tremaine felt as if he had just come to an estate, when, had he con- sidered that his remaining liabilities, all counted, footed up nearly thrice that sum, he might have found reason to consider himself yet a pauper. Waxing confident, then, by the possession of so much money, he resolved first to draw it, and then    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6851-00000111"/> 220     BLONDE A"I BRUINEE f. proceed to Ruby street, and face the father of Xanthine. As his bad fortune would have it, he missed Donald, who had just come away, (McAboy passed the bank while Tom was pocketing his bank notes inside,) and came upon Mr. Blake at a' mo- ment when the latter was meditating, not in the most contented frame of mind, on the result of their interview. Mr. Blake was fretted, and per- haps Tom himself was at the bottom of his uneasi- ness, so that he was by no means in a favorable dis- position to hear what the young man had to say. Nor was Tremaine's manner of accosting the subject calculated to propitiate Patrick Blake, Esq., Sen. "The puppy strutted in," said Mr. Blake, "in the most pompous stoile, as if he had the whole Bank of England in his briches pocket, and address- ing me with a complacent smoile, requisted the favor of a few minutes' private conversation; and says he,' Misther Blake, I believe I've the honor sir,' says he,' to heve wan the affections of yer daughter, Miss Xanthine Blake.'-' An' ifye have?' says I, eyein' the feller not in the most compleemen- tary manner. ' An if ye have, sir? '-' Thin,' says he, ' I've the honor to ask your permission to pay her- my addresses.' 'Sir,' says I, 'any one that was not a dashed rascal would have asked that   IN WHCH THE STORY ADVANCES.   221 quistion first. I wish you good mornin', Misther Tremaine.'--And with that I turned me back on the feller, and I saw in the glass door of the count- ing-room that he stood for a minute by the fire as if he'd been struck stupid, and then he turned too on his heel and strutted out of the store as he came. Such a proud, extravagant, supercilious popinjay as that to be comin' to ask my permission to pay his addresses to my daughter! I'm glad I settled him." Such was, indeed, an over-true account of the vulgar, ill-bred way in which Mr. Blake, senior, received the proposition that Mr. Thomas Tremaine made him for the hand of his younger daughter. And if any one remarked that Mr. Blake behaved like a "vulgarian,' I shall be obliged to admit it, and for that matter, I observed to him not long after, in speaking of it, that to this brusque and cutting response of his to a proposal for which thanks, at least verbal ones, were due, was owing, in a great degree, the unpleasant turn which the matter took subsequently, and which Mr. Blake had great reason to regret. For Tom did not fail to. obtain an interview with Xanthine, and represented to her very faith- fully all that had occurred, not forgetting to lay particular stress on the sale of his carriage and    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6851-00000112"/> 222     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. horses, with a view to the adoption of a new mode of life, and as a pledge of the industry and economy he was about to practise, as her suitor and her hus- band, the very morning on which he had been so insulted. And Xanthe's indignation at such un- worthy treatment of her lover, was naturally much heightened by her knowledge of the very different manner in which her father had behaved towards Donald, more particularly shown in his conveying a letter from the latter to her sister Melanie. This cruel difference made between them excited every natural feeling of resentment, of course; the rather because she considered that she had been far less to blame than Mel, inasmuch as she had not concealed- the fact of Tremaine's suit a single day or hour, after she was herself entitled to be aware of it. In short, it is easy to imagine that Xanthine for ahun- dred reasons, some of which were pretty good ones, thought herself very hardly, very unfairly, and very partially used. Tremaine could not visit the Blakes, it is need- less to observe, after the rude and, as he said, " the ungentlemanly" treatment he had experienced from papa Blake. There were no more visits either, on the part of the young ladies to McAboy's stu- dio, and Madam Blake, to ensure that their morn- ing-walks should not offer an opportunity of meet-   IN WHCH THE STORY ADVANCES.   223 ing and conversing, on the famous Blooming-Way, made some excuse to be their companion on those occasions. Not that Melanie or Xanthine would have abused the confidence reposed in them, but in fact, if two young ladies should meet two young gentlemen of their acquaintance in kthe Blooming- Way of a morning, say when they were shopping, could they prevent the young gentlemen turning about and walking beside them, or following thfem into shops-say Lawn &amp; Cachemire's thronged and almost illimitable saloons, or the beautiful show-rooms of Messrs. Agate and Silberwaaren, dealers in fancy-goods and jewelry? It is quite evident that in such circumstances the presence of mamma would relieve the best disposed daughters of a painful responsibility, perhaps of a rosy em- barrassment. Indeed we must do our friends Xan- thine and Melanie the justice to say, that they found their mother's company a real relief, by ren- dering impossible those meetings and conversa- tions which they felt bound in conscience to re- fuse, but which they would have experienced a great difficulty on the part of their own inclinations in resisting, those inclinations being all the other way. Moreover Donald McAboy was obliged in hon- or, by a tacit engagement to papa Blake, not to    <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6851-00000113"/> 224     BLONDE- AND BRUIEITE seek any further intercourse with Melanie till after tle close of the penitential season. But it was not so with Tremaine, and Tom, I must say, left no means untried to snatch a moment's talk with Xan- thine, or at least to exchange with her some silent token of remembrance and regard. The principal occasions which he made use of for this laudable purpose, were the religious services held during these two weeks, especially in the evening, and which both the sisters faithfully attended. Great were the crowds that gathered in the venerable church of St. Petrus to hear Father Rowman's fer- vent instructions, two evenings in the week. The excellent-pastor never appeared to greater advan- tage than on these occasions. The apathetic man- ner which distinguished his ordinary address was transformed into fire and unction when he expati- ated on the sufferings of his Master, and all the la- tent ardor of his soul broke forth when he dwelt on the:sympathetic dolors of the Virgin without spot, when he described the unsullied yet ardent and impetuous John, reposing tranquilly on the breast of his Lord, and drew from every picture traced by his lips, a lesson that came home to every heart. Xanthine and Melanie in their father's crowded pew, listened with breathless attention, and while they learned to contemn their own petty   IN.

But when the congregation poured out of the church, it was difficult for a family party to keep together; it was natural that a young lady should get separated from her friends in the rude pushing that took place in the densely packed aisle, where every one was eager to reach the open air before the rest, (we speak now of the vulgar mass of the audience,) and then it would chance that a tall, well-dressed young Gothamite gave Miss Xanthine his arm, and aided her to avoid being crushed under foot, or at least prevented that fate happening to her shawl. It was unavoidable under these circum- stances that the young lady exchanged some words with her protector, being in fact an intimate ac- quaintance, and if she fell in ('ll suppose) with some party of friends going the same way, and, having lost her papa and mamma, went on home- wards with them, in the close column that occupied the sidewalk, that the said acquaintance should walk on by her side: and between St. Petrus and Santa- klaus-square it is wonderful what a prodigious inter- change of sentiment and of interesting facts could take place, when both parties were willing to trade 10*    <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6851-00000114"/> 226    BLONDE .AND BRUNETTE. in those commodities, and neither was disposed to stand disputing over the relative value of what they gave and received in such a barter. I only state these things by way of hypothesis, for I am ignorant how the facts stood, except on one occasion when I happened myself to walk home behind Miss Xanthine Blake, who, as well as her sister, was mixed with a party of young people of both sexes, and I know for a certainty that Tom Tremaine, in a sort of mysterious toggery-a half disguise-McAboy's plaid wrapped round the up- per part of his figure, and a navy relief-cap drawn over his eyes, never quitted her'side the whole way, and Xanthe's tongue (usually glib enough) kept time -ith her feet, which moved but slowly, and I could not hear a word she said, she spoke so low- a most unusual thing to be remarked in XXanthine Blake. In the mean time as the sorrowful season drew to a close, and that of sacred joy approached daily, and at last hourly nearer, both our young friends were invited, partly by a rule of their religion and partly by a habit of their family, and no doubt by' their own pious desire, to a very confidential in- terview with their pastor, in which all such pecca- dilloes as we have hinted at, (if such they were,) all failures of filial duty, indulgence of unauthor.   IN WHCH THE STORY- ADVANCES.  227 ized or disapproved affections, and in one case at least, the intention of joining in perpetual and holy wedlock with a person who acknowledged no such obligations, had to be avowed and submitted for advice, reproof, and (we suppose) authoritative judgment-this kind of recourse to a secret, im- partial tribunal of conduct and intentions, being peculiar to the way of thinking in which Melanie and Xanthine-had been brought up. Perhaps in their lives it had never cost them so severe an in- ward conflict, and yet I have heard them say that they never were more anxious to go through with it, hard as it was. The obligation of secrecy be- ing all on one side, and the girls themselves at per- fect liberty to tell all that passed, I learned after- wards as much of these interviews as they at least thought fit to discover. If there was any thing that they had no mind to make public, no doubt they had the discretion to keep it safe enough. But what I heard from them was as follows: Miss Melanie Blake got soundly lectured on this occasion for her long concealment of Mr. Don- ald McAboy's suit from her parents, whereby mat- ters had gradually proceeded so far, that an affec- tion which might easily have been nipped in the bud, was now grown into such an absorbing passion that it would hardly permit the voice of prudence    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6851-00000115"/> 22-8 -   BLOND"   BRUNETTE. and religion to be heard against it, while so much encouragement on all sides had been given to the young man, that it was doubtful whether justice did not require the fulfilment- of the implied prom- ises already given, and certainly they could not be withdrawn without great hardship. And yet it was better to suffer pain, or even to inflict it, how- ever keen it might be for the time, than to risk Melanie's faith, her principles, her happiness in this world, or the next, by a union which in plain terms, Sancta lMater ecclesia, her infallible and yet most tender guide, disapproved and abhorred. This made Melanie cry very much, for she could not have believed that Father Rowman would be so severe upon the project so dear to her heart, and she told him, she said, that it was just a ques- tion with her of marrying Donald or not at all. Not merely that she had never seen any one before whom she could or would marry, and never ex- pected to, in future, but, in short, she had never before had an offer of marriage, although she was near one and twenty, and it was not likely she would ever have another, (which Father Rowman thought a very unlikely supposition, but Melanie insisted on it,) and really she had never believed that she was called to a single life. It was her vo. cation, she sincerely believed, to be married, and   IN WHCH THE S  :ADVANCES.   229 she could never fulfil it except with one person; which I am apt to think made her counsellor smile, in spite of the grave circumstances, or perhaps sigh;--for no one else can judge the sentiments of a pastor in observing these little manifestations of our human facility of self-deception. At all events the upshot of it was that Melanie was left to de- cide for herself what she would do, for Father Rowman would neither forbid her to marry McA- boy, nor take the responsibility (which she would have been glad to lay upon him) of authorizing or advising it; only he said at last, and Melanie eagerly caught at it, that he hoped "it would be overruled for the best." So Melanie Blake got her absolution, I take it, and made her Easter, and some few days after I know for certainty that my friend McAboy resumed his visits to Santaklaus square, and it was very soon understood among us that he was engaged to be married to the eldest of the Blake girls. We have seen how Xanthine's affaire du cceur met with a cruel reception from her family; her father was obstinately stern and implacable with her; never before had he shown himself proof against her wheedling and filial caresses; a dark, scowling brow he wore day after day, like cross papas in romantic novels, towards his beloved and    <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6851-00000116"/> 230    BLONDE: :ND BRUNETTE.  favorite child. And even her mother was silent, not daring to encourage Xanthine, (for her father forbade it,) and thinking it unwise to sympathize with her. Her brothers were awkward and re- served; Harry alone, who was under the shadow of her disgrace, from his former intimacy with Tremaine, showed her a rough kindness that made her feel more her isolation from the rest. Nay- the unkindest cut of all-even Melanie, who cer- tainly ought in these circumstances to have con- soled-her with all sisterly tenderness, could not refrain, when Xanthine complained of the inequal- ity of the treatment they received, from pointing out that the difference was founded on the superi- ority of her Donald's character over Tremaine's; while Xanthine warmly retorted, and bitterly be- lieved, that it was far more the superior prosperity of :McAboy's finances.--"If Tom had a fine flour- ishing practice," cried she, " and was going to have a great deal of money some of these days from his uncle James, papa would like him as well as Don- ald." So it was in a very discouraged and apprehen- sive state of mind that Xanthe went to take her place in the curtained box, one of whose three compartments contained Father Rowman, and with a heart quite sinking, and yet throbbing to suffo-   IN WHCH THE STO  ADVANCES.   231 cation, that she heard the little wooden slide with- drawn, that being withdrawn, left only a certain grating between her and his listening ear. But Xanthine met with more indulgence in that court than Melanie, to believe her own story, which I see no reason to doubt. Father Rowman never re- proved her at all. Perhaps it was because, of all wherein he judged her in fault, she accused herself so penitently. Indeed, he rather exonerated-her of blame in some points where she was ready to condemn herself. She was not bound to know, he observed, what were the intentions of a young man, or rather she was bound to be ignorant of them, until they were plainly declared either to herself or to her parents; and since the youth in this case had chosen her as the channel, she had acquitted herself of every obligation by imparting the mat- ter immediately to her natural protectors; a step for which he commended her with a warmth that caused Xanthine's tears to flow as freely as her sister's, but from a different cause. In short he gave a great deal of most excellent advice, Xanthe said, and especially this, that being pledged to her lover only on the condition of her parents' consent, and that consent having been refused, she was now perfectly free, and by no means should she think of making any other promise, unless, since the    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6851-00000117"/> 232a    BLONDE AND .BUNlETE. young man in question was but a nominal Negative, he should renounce that erroneous persuasion alto- gether and profess the Positive faith. And Xan- thine, who was quite penetrated with gratitude, and full of good dispositions, readily promised to follow this counsel to the letter, and went away from this dreaded interview infinitely consoled. So great a difference there is between the point of view of the best papas and mammas, and that which is found to be taken in that mysteriously curtained box, and behind that little grating. I found afterwards that the difference did not end here, for Father Rowman's point of view sub- sequently turned out quite different from that of most or any papas and mammas, in a way that I scarcely expected. "Fathers and mothers," said he, when I demanded an explanation of this pecu- liarity, "are charged by Providence with the care of their children's worldly prospects, and nature itself teaches them to be prudent for them in that respect, and so it easily happens that dangers which affect only their souls do not receive much atten- tion or are quite overlooked. But even if they are ever so anxious on that point, they are not entitled to penetrate the deepest secrets of their children's hearts, and so they are no judges whether they are in any spiritual danger or no; whence it is not   IN WHCH THE STORY ADVANCES.   233 surprising that their conclusions are different from ours, to whom all is exposed in the most sacred confidence. Our advice is based on a knowledge of which the child keeps the key, and would not turn it perhaps for the most tender and trusted parent that ever lived; and it has but one purpose, that of preserving the child always in a state of grace, while the parent has quite other ends in view, and either thinks little of this, or entirely disregards it." Father Rowman said this after Melanie and Xanthine both-but I anticipate.    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6851-00000118"/> CHAPTER XXIII. PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING. THE time was past when McAboy thought of taking a bride like Melanie Blake to his attic, to work and love together as young artists in Paris live with the class of lorettes, substituting only the sacred bond of marriage for the temporary one of pleasure and convenience. He might have been right in his idea, as a matter of principle, for surely a great deal of unhappiness, and wickedness too, springs in this world from people's false notions of what is necessary in their style of living. But prosperity had brought with it other ideas. It was now needful to pay respect to opinion, and so great a concession as he found Melanie and her family were making in her marrying a Negative, required that every other arrangement on his part should be strictly according to rule. Usage directed a tour immediately after a wedding for all well-bred   PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING.   235 couples, so McAboy's marriage had to be deferred at least till he could command leisure for this ne- cessary sequel of it, that is, till he had completed his commissions, or those which were pressing, and had finished his sitters. In other words, it was needful to wait till other people began to quit Gotham for summer travel or watering-places. "We must wait for the villegiatura," said Donald, gayly. Melanie was willing enough to wait: she had as much as she could do anyhow, to get ready for the important change as a well-bred bride should. Indeed, I have often noticed that many a girl is very eager to be married, and very determined to be married, who, when the compact is formed, is not less very reluctant to fix the day. Then, again, there was the question of after the tour-what should they do when they came back,? The usage of Gotham warranted young people of their condition in boarding for a year or two, but to this Donald was resolutely and wisely averse. He preferred the Parisian garret, with the wife's own little menaqe, however humble it might be, to the most fashionably splendid boarding-house in Gotham. Neither would he take a room at his father-in-law's, as Mrs. Blake advised, ,' until they could look about them." As the season for rent-    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6851-00000119"/> 236     BLONDR AD BRBITN Th. ing houses was at hand, he proposed to take one and furnish it at once against their return from the tour. His uncle James offered him one at a low rate, in a new street he had built, and which he wished to fill with a superior class of tenants. Then McAboy with hereditary astuteness offered to buy, and on his uncle's asking (he thought) too much, resolved to buy at all events, but of some- body else. Mr. Blake confirmed him in this notion. Donald had some thousands in bank, or would have shortly; quite enough to pay down; and the re- mainder could stand on bond and mortgage; he might as well pay the rent in the shape of interest as in any other, and the inevitable rise in the property would then be his own gain. McAboy took Melanie to see a number of houses, and at last they found one that appeared to suit her; but their ideas had risen so much in the process of house-hunting, that Mr. Blake pronounced the price more than Donald could yet afford to give. It was a third more than that of the house his uncle James had offered him; but then it was in a situation already fashionable, and of easy, agreeable access. It was, indeed, in Crayon street, just off Mount Vernon square, of whose young trees it commanded a view. It was three-storied, marble- stepped, marble-mantled to the very topmost story,   PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING.  237 with baths and gas and "every modern conve- nience," besides having a brick stable in the rear, to which McAboy already talked of adding a story, to serve as a studio. The thing was susceptible of being made quite perfect; and as for the rent, or interest, why he " should give up his rooms on the Blooming-Way, of course, and that alone would save all the difference." There is nothing like striking when the iron is hot. The price of this house was $10,000; of which $7,000 could be raised on a mortgage. The brokers who sold it offered to lend that amount on it. It was necessary, however, to pay $3,000 in cash, and McAboy had only some $1,700 in hand. Then Mr. Blake, seeing that he was resolved on the purchase, and thinking it a good investment at all events, promptly told his future son-in-law to draw upon him for what he needed to complete the bar- gain. McAboy calculated that by the first of July, when he could be ready to leave town, he should be in funds to repay Mr. Blake, and have enough over to make him easy about current expenses. As for furnishing the new house, Melanie's father had said from the first day it was mentioned, that if they concluded to go to housekeeping imme- diately, he would do that for Melanie, and charge it to her portion.    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6851-00000120"/> 238    BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. It would appear that this project was only agitated in order to show how willing Mr. Blake was to do any thing for Melanie and McAboy, and how cordially he entered into the project of their union, bating the one objection to which he now seldom alluded. For while they were all full of the house, another question arose. What should be the direction of the wedding tour? -The celebrated Oceanic falls, so called from the immense body of water which there rushes over a tremendous precipice, and the neighboring royal province of Nova Gallia, were a favorite pro- gramme. Donald's patron, Mr. De Grotius, ad- vised him, if he adopted this route, to wind up by coming down the Lake of the Verdant Mountains, and that of St. Sacrament, and to pay a visit to the wild regions lying about Lake Pheasant and Big Buck, where he would shoot deer and catch trout to his heart's content, enjoying at the same time a scenery, then almost unknown to artists, and of great splendor, J - "But if I were you," said Mr. De Grotius, who was anxious about McAboy's fame, and disliked to see him, seduced by a temporary success, plunge into the vortex of fashionable portraiture, the only branch of art which could sustain the expenses Donald meditated,- "if I were you, I would go abroad at once."   PREPARATIONS -FOR THE WEDDING.  239 McAboy had already thought of this plan. As we have observed, by the end of June, after get-. ting through with certain commissions and finishing all his portraits for the season, he would have some thousands on hand, and he had commissions to the amount of as many more, which it would take a year of leisure worthily to execute. What better time, then, could he seize for another trip abroad, to show Europe to his young wife, to enjoy their first year of marriage together there, and, while refreshing his recollections of old art, to heighten rather than diminish his reputation at home. Then he would execute his commissions so much more satisfactorily abroad-with so much more tran- quillity, and yet with so much more fervor. There was one in particular which Mr. De Grotius talked of giving him, but which he had rather declined, because he did not feel able to undertake it in Gotham, to which in any art-capital of the old world he could apply himself with enthusiasm. McAboy was not long in deciding on a project when once he had deliberately entertained it. -He found by inward experience that the artist is essen- tially (as some one has said) of the great Gipsy tribe of the world; he belongs to the "G rande Bohme ;" wandering is his natural vocation, and there is something in houses and lands, and espe-    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6851-00000121"/> 240     BLONDJ AJD BRUNEtIBE. cially in town lots, naturally unpropitious to his free development. He reasoned about it with his intended and her family, and found in the former at least a flattered and eager r ponse to his ideas. In short, the element of romance is necessarily the strongest in an artist, and to spend his first wedded year roving over the classic countries of the civil- ized world, amid the vast repositories of art and the finest scenes of nature, was too fascinating an idea to be relinquished. The idea of property and of amassing must necessarily yield to it. It was agreed that housekeeping, and house-purchasing should be deferred till they came back, and that immediately upon their marriage, McAboy and Melanie should go abroad, to remain a year. It was charming in those days to hear Melanie discourse of these plans: you would have thought that the development and future fame of a Michael Angelo or a Raphael, at the very least, were at stake upon their decision, with so pretty an im- portance did she detail the various motives which conducted to it. This sort of egotism that mag nifies the doings and interests of another self, in which their own is lost, is peculiar to women. They are more difficult to be cured of it, than men of their coarser selfishness, which a certain tact leads the latter to hide, and a higher principle, we   PREPARATIONS POR THE WEDDING.     241 hope, sometimes succeeds in suppressing. Conjugal and maternal selfishness is so like a virtue, so sweet and amiable in its own eyes, so pardonable in the eyes of others, that it scarcely cares to disguise itself, wins an easy and pretty constant victory over good-breeding, and is almost proof against grace.     <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6851-00000122"/>  CHAPTER XXIV. xx  . TOM'S CONVERSIONl ABOUT three months then were to elapse be- tween the engagement and the marriage of Me- lanie: in the mean time, what of poor Xanthe? Let us own that her case is a hard one, to witness her sister's full cup of happiness preparing, while her own has been rudely dashed to the ground. Her father already treats Donald as a son-n-law, while Tom is not even received as a visitor at the house. The name of the one is on every domestic lip, while that of the other is proscribed. Trous- seaux, and houses, and furniture, and wedding tours and foreign travel are talked of for the elder sister, while the younger must not so much as hint at a modest anticipation of some future destinyfor herself. We must not forget, however, that she enjoys a consolation which Melanie has not, in that she :has no misgivings of conscience, which is more   TOM'S CONVRO0XON.        243 than Melanie can say. We have before mentioned Xanthine's poetical turn, and the following, whith was found among her papers, and bears date in the spring of that year, appears to express her feelings at this time: "Ah me! thy wound, my heart I must helpless prove, Which others' joy so causeless makes to bleed! Their wealth would never hurt thy happy love, Which being hapless, learns this envious greed. "Ungoverned heart! persuade thyself indeed, In others' joy to find not desperate harms; Let not that bliss thy jealous anger feed Which never keeps thy loved one from thy arms. Oh, heart! repine not for that 'tis decreed By others' will to cheat thee of thy love, Since thou hast promised for a heav'nly meed, Thy wildest wishes shall not thither rove. Ah, since thy will with theirs all one is found, Let not their joy re-ope thy secret wound." While Xanthine thus lamented and consoled herself in secret, she had not the misery of think- ing Tom  unworthy of her, but indeed quite the reverse. All that she heard of his new efforts (and she heard only the creditable part) endeared him to her, the more. As we have already seen, Tre- maine's business, provided-he attended to it in per-    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6851-00000123"/> 1244    BLONDE AND BRTNJETE. son, netted him enough to be happy upon (as McAboy observed) with Xanthine, in those times, and enough for a young man in business, with Tom's- friends and prospects, to marry upon pru- dently. To attend to it was, indeed, to work hard, but who, in the outset of life, beginning with nothing, has not to work hard? Tom's partner, B  ley Alford, of as good family as Thomas lcAbpoy Tremaine, Esq., and a fellow of splendid talents to-boot, worked hard,-as Tom observed, "devilish hard." He would not have won so early in life, or ever, the distinction he afterwards did, had he not worked " devilish hard." Genius and hard work are the two factors of eminence and of fame; and without genius, with respectable talents such as Tremaine had, with a winning exterior and a fair start in life, hard work was still the essential requisite to the enjoyment of an honorable happi- ness in youth, and an easy fortune in the coming manhood and age. But is it possible for a Tom Tremaine, an insect of a day, to quit his butterfly existence, roving from flower to flower in the par- terre of society, rifling id consuming their sweets, and enter upon that oithe industrious, foreseeing and hiying bee? Tom tried it. He dismissed his clerk, who already paid more attention to his own pleasures   TOM'S CONrVESION.     245 than to Tremaine's business-so that Alfor&amp;dir- getically complained of it,-and gave his moring hours to his office. True he generally arrived there at least an hour later, and departed, worn out, (he said,) at least an hour earlier than his indefatigable partner; and as, if a willing horse and a lazy one are harnessed in the same carriage, no amount of whipping willget out of the latter his fair sie of work, and consequently the willing one must make it up, so Alford was forced to supply Tom's deficiencies, (for the reputation of the office,) and he did it more contentedly for Tremaine, whom he liked and rather petted, than for Tremaine's negli- gent clerk. The chief danger to our friend's steadiness in this new path was the evening. It is a season of the year that is peculiarly perilous to unoccupied young men, in the way of billiards, and of other amusements less indifferent in themselves, which are always at hand in a great city. The dissipations of society renewed themselves after Easter, the more fervently as the advancing season would soon close them; and gayeties pplonged into the small hours of the night were a bad preparation for punctuality and industry on the morrow.

Mr. McAboy gave three evenings of thet workday week to the Blakes, either in society *' them, or at some place of amusement, or -  PteI still, reading or hearing Melanie read, from s6ime;book connected with art or artists, which he had introduced to their notice. The new element of refinement and elegant culture which he thus infused into the family was very noticeable, and they all enjoyed it exceedingly. Tremaine had no wife or babies, no taste for literature-except of a sort that was far from improving,-and he Was cut off from the social evenings at the Blakes, which would have elevated and sustained him, as we' may well suppose. "Work at home," Donald said. "Make up for lost time. Read up your law." Tom tried this, too, for he was really in earnest about making some   , and every fresh effort gave him pluck fotr ther.  He actuallyread imnself to sleep two evenings over '"Kenstonie's Commentaries." On the third, he treated resolI- ti0on with a game of billiards, where he won his   TOM'ss..-i .        24: drinks, and the day following saw him; la te e office. His partner greeted :him with1 a e countenance, An important case was coming on, and some papers that should have been reengrossed stared him in the face on his table.

"f I was married like you," said Tom, "I'd be ^ ar as a clock, but what the -- (dickens) is a like me to do with his evenings?, "Copy law- papers, till he can do better," said Alford a "Weil', said Tom, penitently, -'I'll be --d if I don't copy these to-night." It must be owned that Tremaine's case seems hard, in his being deprived of Xanthine's society and the prospect of being united to her, at the very time when he was making such exertions for the sake of both. But this is the order of things here below, which requiresus to sow for a future harvest, to plough, to labor, to lay out time and money, not for immediate returns, but in hope. He who is not willing, or who lacks the persevering courage, to submit to this condition, shall surely- see the fields of his neig in harvest-time waving with a golden and full- d crop, while his own are overrun with weeds and thistles. That :was just the difference of situation at this moment be- tween Tremainea and; MeAboy.      :  s          r       s j    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6851-00000125"/> 248     BLOZrt bAyD BRUrWJISE. '-'re was, indeed, an obstacle in Tom's way, -whi:onald did not experience. Xanthine let him know in one of their first post-paschal inter- views, with a weeping resolution, that she had de- termined not to marry a Negative, or, at any rate, one whom her parents disapproved. She could not disobey-her Father in heaven and her father on ea4h at the same time, nor fly in the face of the mother who bore her and Holy Mother Church at once. If dear Tom only believed as she did about such things, three of these four parties at least would be on her side, and when she came of age, which would be in two years, she would have him, ifishe had to run away. Here it must be observed that it was Tremaine who had suggested the last mode of overcoming their difficulties. Xanthine repelled it warmly, but she softened her refusal by the above hypothetical declaration, which set Tom, as I believe, upon a new track. - It will be perceived (we have already said so once or twice) that Tremaine had become extreme- ly eager in this pursuit. It is what happens in every chase in proportion as we are engaged in it, whether it be of a runaway debtor or slave, or wife or daughter, or of some game that we never had possession of, such as a deer, or fox, or trout, oran office in the gift of the people or of the President, ,      Ii   TOM'S. CONVBRSION.     249 or a maiden that we woo as a bride. As lang, as there is a hope of obtaining the prize, the m .e:ex- ertion we have made, the more we are willing to make; and time, health, life, fortune, fame and honor are often sacrificed to win what, when won, we scarcely value. But when the game is really valuable, and we are within an ace, as it were, of winning it, and our experience, or our sanguine disposition convinces us that success is possible by dint of perseverance, then the ardor we feel is pro- portionably increased, and obstacles only feed the flame of our impetuous desires. Such was precise- ly the case with Tremaine in respect to our Xan- thine. She was a lovely young girl, gracious and lovable; and endued with such a mixture of vi. vacity and tenderness, of simplicity and wit, of honest susceptibility and genuine talent, as made her grow upon acquaintance, and command grad- ually as much respect as love, even from a Tom Tremaine. Their intercourse as lovers had taught him, too, to appreciate the delicacy and firmness of her principles, notwithstanding her Celtic ardor and frankness, so different from the calculating coldness of the young :ieigeese ladies of his fash- ionable circle on the one hand, and from the self- compromising behavior which, on the other, he was familiar with in less refined classes. AndTom    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6851-00000126"/> 250-    BLOND0E A-N BRUNETrE. being f a pliant nature, that took its coloring from its assoiates, (Tom called it tact and high-breed- ing,) his conduct towards Xanthine S respect- ful yet so tender, that she thought, ii- declared him one of the most honorable and high-minded young fellows that ever lived-every way equal in that: respect to Donald McAboy--although the -tdiesiand young ladies too, had done their best to spoil him. And this again reacted upon Tre- maine, who not only began to think that he was really a fine character, but loved Xanthine so much the more for being the occasion of his entertaining this improved opinion of himself. - Tom also thought, or fancied he thought, the rather because it was McAboy's opinion, who ex- pressed it bluntly, that the religious faith of these sisters, however erroneous it might be, was at the bottOm' of their excellencies. And though this ad- mision was not much for a man like MeAboy to make, whose views were clear and tenaciously held with Tremaine, who had no intellectual difficulties, it might lead very far. Tom was anxious to remove the new and unfore- seen obstacle on Xanthiries own part, entirely out of the way. For this purpose, he could devise nothing better than to try the effect of his eloquence on Father Rowman.- Imagine that astute, thorough-   TOMS cONV-isIoTN.     251 ly educated ecclesiastic, completely armed with theoretickignowledge, discernment of character and self-disci engaged in a contest of wills and in- telligence ewith a Tom Tremaine I Tom would be very likely to succumb, you think? True; in some points he would. And yet Father Rowman (for I knew him welD wasa remarkably easy man. He must have been so, or he would not have allow ed himself to be persuaded by one or two inter- views with Mr. Tremaine that the latter was, or might be, considered, in fact, a Positive. Tom in- sisted that he'was not, in any sense, a Negative. He belonged to no Negative communion, the only rite that bound him to a religious belief, had made him, according to Father Rowman's own con- victions, a Positive. He was a Positive, then, by birth, nor had he-Father Rowman himself in- geniously supplied the argument-ever apostatized by professing any other faith. As faras he knew any thing of the Positive creed, Tom averred, he ac- cepted it; he might be reckoned, at worst, as a bad and ill-instructed Positive, who, as matters stood, must be suffered to count as one. So far, the pastor of the Blakes was easy enough; too easy, some may think, and I. own that if I were a Positive, I should be of their opin. ion; but then came a point where he was o:bli    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6851-00000127"/> 262     B1LOKE :Ar) BRUNITfTE. to bW unyielding.

It--washere tat the conflict between our friend Tomi and his spiritual adversary was to be disputed, here the victory was to be decided. I cannot speak from positive knowledge, but it is my belief that Tremaine went a great deal further than truth warranted in the profession of Positivism, in his eagerness td obtain the consent of Xanthine's spirit- ual guide, I would not be sure, I say, that partly under the influence of his passion, swelled by all the aggravating circumstances I have indicated,. and partly under that of a fit of penitence Which just then seized Tremaine for all the errors of his bachelor life,-I would not be sure, although the fruit was so transient, and he kept it so secret that I cannot affirm,-that he did not actually enter Father-Rowman's mysterious box himself, and ful- fil all the duties of a good Positive, which that pru- dent though indulgent pastor deemed it right to permit him. This part of Tremaine's history is; however, wrapped up in a little cloud of mystery that I have never been able wholly to penetrate.

If even this were so, we must not, however, judge Tom too severely. He may have been sincere, I do not think, as I have said, that of dogma he had an idea. We cannot see into the heart, and there have been conversions apparently no better motived than his, which have proved unalterably persistent, and have given in an edifying change of life the best proof of their genuineness. And although Tremaine's case breaks down in this last point, I must do him the justice to say, that in all his subsequent life, however little to be commended in some respects, he has invariably played the part of what is called a non-practical Positive; if asked, or if the subject is brought upon the tapis, he always says ih his smiling, confident way, "I am a Positive, though I confess, a very bad one;" while Father Rowman decisively says, when the case is mentioned, "Tremaine is a Positive.

And I an  to think that ^if-Mr. P. Blake, sen, had chanced to light upon these verses of his daughter's, as he did upon certain others that the gentle reader remembers, he would have shut her up; and if, in his ignorance of what is called poetic license, he understood literally all the glowing ex- pressions of Xanth's sonnets, he would perhaps be justifiable. But where the girl got her style, is the thing that puzzles me. Her free access to, and constant ferreting in the poetic stores of her father's richly-lined book-case, among all those gilt calf-backs, and clearly-printed antique leaves of the British classics, might, as her mother hinted, partly account for it. But there must have been an im- petuous and sparkling fountain of fancy and feeling gushing up in that hidden nook of her girlhood, hidden by the roses of smiling youth-to suggest such a flood of sentiments, to flowso freely forth in that quaint old borrowed style. It is plain, we think, that she took Tom's con- version, both moral and speculative, for a genuine work, (and so, perhaps it was, though not lasting,) and that such a belief 'must have helped wonder- fully in that divinizing process which the heart* o    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6851-00000129"/> ::266    BITONDE AND BRUNmtrTE . woman so easily applies to the object that has suc- ceeded in filling the vacant niche in its inner tem- ple, which she has always been persuaded, and rightfully, was intended by the builder for a god. There she instals the image of clay, and crowns it with ambrosial- flowers, and offers it triumphantly the sweet incense of her affections. ( A little part and that the worst he sees," who ascribes to the meaner part of our nature the fervid exaltation of woman's love, in its first pro- fuse and unwise prodigality, like Xanthine's. It is the bewilderment of a divine instinct: the mis- direction of a faculty whose true object is worthy of all the devotion that she offers to an idol. Indeed it is evident from the swiftness of the water and the foam and noise when it encounters an obstacle, that we are nearing the falls we spoke of, where the wild and rock-bedded stream leaps bold- ly andbrightly over the dizzy cliff into the basin below. A part of the double torrent has been withdrawn into a calmer channel wrought by art, where it will feed (say) an over-shot mill-wheel, use- ful as well as ornamental object, in the exquisite landscape, but the remainder will find its own way, which God and nature have shown it, to the ap- pointed level of the fair country whither it so rest- lessly tends.   TOM'S CONVERSION.      257 Early in June, when the Blake family went to Red Fort for the summer, Xanthine made another effort, through her mother, to overcome her papa's objections to Tiemaine. Never was papa more ob- stinate than Mr. Blake. But my dear Patrick;" urged the maternal in- tercessor, "Xanthine says that Mr. Tremaine is now a true Positive, not yet formally so, but only wait- ing a proper time to take the decisive step, and perfectly convinced." "I don't care a dash what he is," growled, most profanely, Mr. Blake; " no Tom Tremaine shall iver marry a daughter of mine with my consint. I'd think you'd seen enough of Tom Tremaines, Mrs. Blake, but it- seems you'll never be contint till you've got one, any how." "Now that is a very unkind remark, Pat," said Mrs. Blake, blushing, for there was just a shade of truth in this jealous observation, as to the cause of her partiality for Xanthine's suitor. "I should be very sorry if Xanthine's happiness must be sacri- ficed, without any reason, merely because you were jealous of the gentleman's father.'" "Because the gentleman's father was a scamp, nia'am; and the son is the moral and personal picter of him," retorted Mr. Blake. "Indeed-you've no right to: say- so, Patrick,'    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6851-00000130"/> 258     BLOsWE A. I BR". BBUNETTI replied his -wife, in a grieved tone. "If Mr. : Tre- maine's father ever behaved dishonourably towards me,; you are the last person who ought to complain, as you profited by it."  "I own that, ma'am; Ive profited to have my daughter running after his son, bejingo." "I shall not notice that unjust aspersion upon Xanthine's modesty," said the mother, crimsoning -iaignantly. -"But as for young Mr. Tremaine, he has-never deserted Xanthine, or played her false in any wtay, and he might (every one knows) have had his pick among the richest girls in Gotham this winter.- There was Virginia Randolph was crazy ifor him, and she has eighty thousand dollais all her own.: -Your favorite Mr. McAboy, his cousin, says that Miss Randolph was certainly in love with Tom. Everybody allows that Mr. Tremaine has wonderful- ly changed his habits since he knew Xanthe. He was never dissipated, but now he has become strict- ly ;attentive to business, and they are getting a great deal of it." T"Yes, yes," groaned Mr. Blake, "that bright lad, Alford, is the working horse. Tom Tremaine is:jist a drag on the concern." "You will never believe any good of him, on account of his name, Patrick, and that I call an un- iristian, prejudice. Especially, if he is really, as I   TOM'S OtvERSIoN.      2t5 9 believe, and as Father Rowmanrl himself believes, (for I don't trust Xanthine,) if he is really convert- ed to our faith, it is our duty to: take him by the hand and encourage him in his new! path." "Now if he's going to turn his coat, I think worse of him than I did before. What' does he hope to get, I wonder? Xanthe had better think of Pat McDonough, orsome other honest fellow who has no need to deny his religion -to get her money, and as for Misther Thomas Tremaine, I'd advise him to look after Miss Randolph's money- bags, for he'll never have the fingerin' of mine, and I'll send him word of that same this very day.": This threat Mr. Blake carried into effect by pen- ning a note to Tremaine, not precisely insulting, for it was meant to be civil, (civil with a shocking qualification, used by Mr. Blake in characterizing it,) in which he was given to understand that if he took Xanthine, it would be without a penny, and not one cent (same shocking epithet applied to this hypothet- ical coin) would Mr. Patrick Blake give her if she married Mr. Thomas Tremaine. This was in a-man- ner, I think, to tell Mr. Tremaine that he might, if he liked, run away with Xanthine and be--hem I Heaven forbid that I should imitate-the:profane vul- garityi of Xanthine's father H Mr. Blake undoubtedly supposed -that by1,this    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6851-00000131"/> 26O     BLONDJ AND BRBUNi E threat he would effectually deter Tom from pro- ceeding further in his suit. But there he reckoned surely without his host. For in the first place, men in-these cases are not often as good as their word. Men are placable beings, and fathers above all.' A resolution that they ought never to have made, though guarded by many asseverations, they often -find good motives afterwards to break. They re- lent, -they blame themselves for their harshness, they atone for it by humbly undoing what they did proudly. Then again, without losing any of'his laudale intentions, Mr. Blake might fail to carry: them into, effect. He might die intestate, when Xanthine would get her legal share of his property, whatever it was. People die intestate every day who certainly never intended to do so, sometimes to. the annoyance and sometimes to the great joy of their heirs. Or, again, he might execute avery precise will, cutting off Xanthine without the first red-cent, and for want of some unlucky formality the will not be admitted to probate, when the heirs- at-law would take. Or again, which often happens, if the wil were contested, the court might break it on account of its injustice. No one knew better than -a young lawyer who had often had small cases in the Surrogate's Cburt, how to appreciate all these-chances. And lastly, in affairs de matrimonio ,.        o   TOM'S CONVEiSION.     2 contrahendo, such as this was, it is not safe to reck- on only on the cupidity of the parties-.-their love, their pride, their honor, their anger, and their sense of duty and justice, may induce them to persevere in their plans, against the plainest dictates of pecu- niary interest. Tremaine showed her father's note to Xanthine, and urged her for the first time boldly and almost prevailingly, to fly with him from such injustice and scorn, to let him show that it was for her and not for her father's money that he cared. Perhaps you will ask how he so readily obtained these interviews. In Gotham it was by no means difficult, or rather, unless there were a duenna vig- ilance which could scarcely be possible, and which would have been the height of impolicy in that land of liberty whereof we write, it was easy and necessary to meet.

Tom came up in the afternoon by the steamboat after office. hours, and visited the Red Fort in the warm June evening in alight skiff, with oar or sail.

At length the happy day arrived for the wed- ding of McAboy and- Melanie. They all came down from Red Fort to Gotham a few days before. On a fine summer morning, in the drawingroom of Mrs. Blake's house in Santaklaus square, looking out upon the umbrageous and flower-besprinkled park, were forever sealed the vows which-they had first exchanged when those fine old trees -ere- leafless and those flower-beds ice-bound and-naked. The square was filled with carriages, for .the' bride received her friends at the same time. All the Blake and Bailey connection, whether by blood or business, and all-the McAboys' and-their following. The wealthiest of the latter, and the proudest; were glad to afficher (as the French say) their rela tionship to the distingaished young artist,- ho was regarded as one of the illustrations of hiscotntry.

The blood of the fcA- boys of Mull, and their famous coat of "a Scotch mull. proper, quartered with a cigar-case ouvert, between, Or, two foils or leaves, demi-twisted, of the Virginia weed," werenot disgraced by this al- liance, for the ancient burghers of Gotham are the nobility of the New World, and the Blakes themselves were undoubtedly descended (which of their country-folk is not ) from dethroned Celtic kings.  Father Rowman performed the ceremony, marked by a nude brevity, directed by his Church on such occasions. Sprucely attired in a well-made 'and rather lengthy black frock-coat, with his snowy shirt-collar neatly turned over his black silk neck- cloth, (both of a somewhat peculiar fashion,) he simply inquired, without book, if they took each other. for. husband and wife, and promised mutual fidelity till death, when, being answered in the affirmative, he pronounced them man and wife and wished them every happiness. Melanie turned pale at this abrupt conclusion, although she expected it, and Donald, warned by the ever-ready. Xanthine, who asked him in a loud whisper, "Where's the ring?" mechanically placed the ring upon his wife's finger.

Tremaine was there,'a little reserved and punctilious towards the rest:of the family, but fraternal to Melanie, with: an air of intelligence and confidence for her sister. Tom, indeed, was one of the groomsmen, (by Melame's particular request;) assisted by: Charlie Lynch and young Hobart Bailey, Melanie's cousin, (these forms were kept up in such families,) and Tom never ap- peared to greater advantage than; on this occasiori; his leadingap a young-lady and; introd ucigtt-vi 12     <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6851-00000134"/> - X     BBLONiTIE RS'UBIONBDiTE. the  ide r wassreally a charming affair, and:!d' k- o - h ow many of the introduced fell in love with himn that morning. If Xanthe herself had not lost her heart to him before, she vowed that she would have lost it: then, and I've nwo doubt she spoke the truth. H-e was a handsome puppy, was Tremaine in thse days: and his fine figure, graceful carriage, lassic s Afeatures and perfect moustache, played the very mischief with the hearts of the ladies, at least f- those who were of an age or of a disposition to be so far dazzled with these external attractions as to look-no further. -i The /interest of the reception was much in- : ereased by the fact that the happy pair were going to8 sail immediately for the Old World, and not. a little also by some of Donald's finest recent pic- tures, not yet sent home, being carelessly disposed about the drawing-rooms. In this it may be that the canny artist, "' True to the fountain whence he drew his blood," had-an eye to business as well as to the gratification of his friends, and if so, he was successful, for a rih -banker; a friend of Mr. Blake, sen., who a-. pired-to- the honorsof art-patronage, after looking at-the picture McAboy had just finished for- -M De :Grfotiousgave hixa the, largest commission he   TO- MT osoNVERsO.  had yet eceived, leaving subject, canvas and style to himself.          ,  The reception, however, came to an end at last, and indeed few assemblies are more frightfully rapid in their course than that which greets a new- made bride. Melanie retired to change her dress. It was really surprising, as everybody said,-how well she had stood the fatigue and excitement. Perfectly dressed, snowy blossoms crowning her dark hair, she looked like a young queen, so bravely she bore herself. And now she must lay aside her silvery robe and sparkling veil, and put on a grave but pretty travelling dress. At five o'clock they start by the eastern boat for Shawmut, (before mentioned, I think, as the capital of the State of Massasoit,) where the next morning they take the ocean steamer for Europe. The family generally took leave of her in Gotham, but her father and mother, and sister Xanthine, accompanied the new married pair to Shawmut, to see them off. McA- boy again, half in jest, half in earnest, urged Xanthine to pack up her bundle and go with them, promising to buy her a complete outfit, the moment they landed on the other side, and she laughingly replied that she "would not go with them for the world., The steamboat, then, bore our weddingoparty,    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6851-00000135"/> 208    iBLOSDB A1 BuuWTiLE. as it-has so many athers, along the-beautiful lhime Oriente which washes the eastern shore of the islnd on which Gotham stands, and into the deep sound :f Isot  unga. - At the city of Foresight they took the cars during the night for Shawmut, and at noon precisely on the following day, the great paddles of the Oceanica began to revolve, /and removed the artist and his bride from their native land. Our thoughts remain behind, with those whose nuptial fate is yet, but not long, in the balance. For but a day or two after the return of the Blakes to Red Fprt, Xanthine having been left in Gotham (for the house was never entirely closed) to attend to some affairs for Melanie, at the daybreak rite in old St. Petrus, few, and those chiefly of the laboring class, being present, before the altar Fa- ther' Rowman united a couple in marriage, and offered for' them subsequently the sacrifice, called for the bridegroom and the bride. It was Tre- maine and Xanthine, (to my unbounded astonish- ment) with a couple of witnesses only, the chival- rous Charley Lynch being one, and the other Tom's cousin, Lola Tremaine, (her mother is a beautiful arid wealthy Creole from the queenly island of An- tilla, the gem of the southern seas.) My astonish- ment was unbounded I say, especially to: see in the I x        .     .   miidst of'fie holiest rite bof-the true Positive 'fiithi the altar gate thrown open-- for Tremainie iani Xanthine to enter, (Xanthine in'virgin white :and the simplest veil,) and kneel within the rails on the lowest step, while splendid and priestly Father Rowman, in rich sacerdotal vestments, turning, blessed them with long and high-sounding prayers, in the presence of all that his creed adores as most holy. ,When they rose and turned to resume their places outside the rail, I observed that Tremaine . was white as a sheet, while Xanthine's face was all of a cherubic bloom. I could not but watch eager- ly for the very sacred and interesting part of the ceremony that followed, and I own was a little dis- appointed, and yet somehow relieved, to fsee that Tom  did not partake in it, though Xanthine and -Lola Tremaine (as devout an Espagnole as ever counted her beads) did. In the vestry after- wards, where -they were -signing papers, (and by the way, I witnessed them, too,) I overheard Xanthine tenderly scolding Tom for his thought- lessness in breaking his fast. "I suppose," said she, in her saucy way, " you Wanted nerve for this trying occasion, and so you must needs fly to that bachelor cupboard and takea aglass of wine to for- tify you: fie! fie!", Then' her voice' sunk to a    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6851-00000136"/> 270    BLONDE"AND BRUNiETrE. hisper, and I could only distinguish, sort of consoling tone--" another time." Aye! Xanthe,-another time! There is a time for all things under the sun, and now is the time of life and youth, for thee and thy mate.  Close by the Church of St. Petrus stood a fa- mous hotel, where breakfast was already waiting for the new married pair in a private parlor. Tre- maine politely invited me to partake of it. Xanth- ine in an adjacent room exchanged the bridal white, which she would wear on this momentous occasion, for her gray travelling dress, and joined us. She was rather gay-quite herself in manner-but ate, naturally, a slender portion. By the time she had swallowed half a cup of coffee, the head waiter came in to announce that the first bell of the 'steamboat was ringing. It was the morning boat up the Hendrick. The pier was at the foot of the street, the carriage at the door, their baggage was put on, and, shawl in hand, kissing Lola Tremane, Xanthine soon sprang in. They were going to Red Fort, to throw themselves at the feet of papa;  and mamma Blake, and implore their forgiveness  for the step they had taken. You may imagine that old Blake was excessive- ly enraged just at first. I believe he was, but all   TQM'S CONVERSIONr.     7- he said Xl5, as I understand, im a tremulous old man's tone-- "Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk, You've gone and got married to Mr. Tremaine, Xanth, an -I hope that he'll make ye a good hus- band. Ye might have asked us to the weddin' though, Xanth." "I'd have been very glad to do it," cried Xan- the, throwing her arms around his neck and hug- ging him in. the most bewitching manner, "but I was dreadfully afraid, papa, that there wouldn't have been any wedding, if I had." "Ye'll never get a cint of my money, I tell you, fool as much as you like" said the old man, obdurately. "And many a long day may it be before anybody 'll be for havin' it but yourself," cries Xanthe, with the sweetest brogue imitation in the world. "And why-would you go to break my heart, thin, with marryin' that -" said old Blake, S6ft- ened, but did not finish the sentence, for Xanthe stopped his mouth with kisses.  - Could a mere mortal resist her wheedling and caresses? I think not. Meanwhile, Tremaine was "coming it," to use his own eipression, " over the  old lady'," Mrs. Blake either was or affected to    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6851-00000137"/> 2712    BtLOE ADB -BRUNEiTE eim-re implacable atfirst than her h nd, pr- iaps. because: she had not been admitted-to the seret, and had been deprived of the pleasure (which-a woman could hardly forgive) of witness- "g the ceremony; but Xanthe soon made up for that by the vivacity of her details. In short, Mr. and-Mrs. Tremaine were allowed and invited to - stay to an early dinner, and -Xanthine finished peking her trunk. At the last, indeed, there was weepiing and reluctance to let them go. Old Blake shed la savage tear or two when the steamboat bell was heard. Towards sunset, about the same hour as when we first saw the sisters on the parapet of fhe old fort, the passing steamboat touched at the pier above, where a flag gayly flying invited its ap- proach, and the second pair of wedded mates from that peaceful cote took their flight on their nuptial joirney,--on the journey of life. : I should here observe, for fear of forgetting it, that -a coolness followed between the Blakes and their pastor, which lasted for many a long year -on -lMr. Patrick Blake's side. Father Rowman, however, always maintained that he had done s-im[ply his duty, by granting what he had no rigt to -refuse, and that the banns had even-- been published at St. Petrus,- which the law at that ltime did not require, nor the canon either.

If this then be a comedy, here it ought to end: both theheroines being married to the two heroes --par nobile fratrum-which means (the unlearned reader is informed) that McAboy and Tremaine are a noble pair of brothers. But as thi is neither exactly a comedy nor yet a tragedy, but rather a true story under fictitious names and semblances, with the gentle reader's permission I shall pursue it a little further, in search of our moral, which so far is not very evident. It may be that I shall not find it after all, or not succeed in making it appa. ent, in which case the gntle reader must con- struct a moral for himself out of the pictures of lfe that the story presents, where truth, like a bitter pill nobody likes, is sugared over with fition   THE WEDDING TOUR.      275 to makej go down, or he may consider that the various reflections with which the writer accomi panies the thread of the narrative, are intended to serve in a moral's stead. Xanthine and Tremaine, then, are started on their wedding tour. Xanthine had gained what most girls think the great object of their:existence: she was married; her life belonged to another; she had lost her self-ownership; the one, exclusive, sovereign right, which belongs wholly to- herself and which is all that most unmarried women pos- sess, she had ceded. Whether she had made a good bargain, had been paid off with counterfeit money, or good current coin of the realm, bright with- the sovereign's image and- full weight, re- mained to be seen. And speaking of money, I must mention that Tremaine was supplied with funds for this expe- dition by the proceeds of the semi-annual balance struck in the office, after the bills had been col- lected. The business had been better than usual; Tremaine's share was about $500, which, after pay- ing one or two pressing debts, left him upwards of $350 for travelling expenses, and Tom calculated that by judicious stoppage at certain interesting points, about six weeks--the utmost time he could be absent-might be very agreeably spent, without S           ,    , s B'1 731321    <pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6851-00000139"/> 276     BLONDE :A-D BRUNEITE. exhausting that sum to 'the last penny-- In the new-tworld a maid, or female attendant, was a lux- ury not necessary to a lady's position; they were but two, and travelling was cheap; hotels a little dear, but that item must be counted on. Tom figured away industriously on letter-backs and cards, to demonstrate that he was amply supplied, and formed a regular programme for the distri- bution of his funds to the various expenses of the wedding trip.  One of the inconveniences of the beaten path of travel they were taking, (for economy's sake, as well  as for the superior accommodations it afforded,) Was that, Tremaine being so well known in the gay world, they were perpetually meeting his acquaint- ance. The very first evening, on the state-room deck of the superb Aquatica-a new boat--as Tom and Xanthine were sitting on the side, outside the saloon, (for it was a lovely July evening, and the sun not-set,) watching the lofty shores of the Hendrick, and the wide, glittering waters they enclosed, like an inland lake, the Langfords came upon them of a sudden, and greeted Tom with animation, eyeing from head to foot his youthful companion. The Misses Langford were delighted to encounter so fa- mous a beau, took for granted he was going to Con- gress Spa, and that he would be at the hotel of the   THE; WEDDING- TOUT.     2-7 "UnitedCJonfederacy," for all the world was there, with lots of eligible Southrons, and waltzing officers and so on, as Rose St. Clair had -written to her de voted chum, the youngest Miss Langford.- Tom himself was the chief of all the eligibles as a part- ner, or for a flirtation, and, in a fair degree, for mat- rimony, on the score of his wealthy connections and rich bachelor uncle, (next to his person, always his best card,) and like the war-horse that neighs at the sound of the trumpet, Tom's social vanity was excited by the familiar appeal, and he could scarcely bear to dash all these delightful anticipations to the ground by avowing himself a married man. The Langfords plainly took Xanthine for a young lady with whomr Mr. Tremaine was flirting, apart from her papa and mamma, or other accompanying friends, nor did he undeceive them, but rattled away about Congress Spa and other topics, till they pass- ed on, promising to meet again. But when, the sun having ceased to glitter among the tree tops of the Highlands, and- dusk having drawn its fine, 'clear curtain over the Hendrick, the waiter announced that the supper-table was ready for the ladies, and Tremaine took his bride down, and Xanthine gave him her bonnet and shawl to throw into a berth, and they sat down together at the brilliantly light- ed table (magnificent with silver branches and paint. #    .       ,    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6851-00000140"/> 218     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. ed:porceeain, and a supper for a king,) the Lang- fords, who happened to be opposite,- saw that the young lady was under Tremaine's protection any- how; and when Xanthine bared her plump, white hands, and the plain, golden circlet, adorning the. ring-finger of the left, which Father Rowman had blessed 'the morn,' became visible to the Misses Langford's curious eyes, the truth began dimly to dawn upon them in the form of an hypothesis. But still it might be a married cousin, or something of that sort, and surely must be, for it was not possi- ble that Mr. T. Tremaine could be engaged, det alone married,) and they, the Langfords, not know it! Of course no improper supposition occurred to them for a moment; for besides that such things are rare, Xanthine, though shamefaced and a little con. strained, looked innocence itself; and her neat, gray travelling dress, with its white linen collar, the youthful tresses, a very wealth of tawny bur- nished gold, bound in the most approved girlish braid, the downcast blue eyes and bright blush, (as she seated herself by Tremaine,) the very sparing meal so daintily partaken of, proclaimed the bride. In short, when the Langfords, papa and all, except a beautiful matron who seemed not to know him, had renewed the conversation with Tremaine across the table, the young ladies (for the Gothai'tes are   THE WEDDING TOUtR.     279 less ceremonious when they travel than the inhabi- tants of Londra are,) addressed some remarks to his lady companion; and Xanthine replied, with her native frankness, which the winter's experience of society had refined into polished ease, as much asit became a young girl to exhibit towards strangers; and Tom was so pleased with it and with the im- pression he saw it had made, that he seized the op- portunity, and, bending forward to the Misses Lang- ford, introduced Xanthine. The very surprise ex- torted the inquiry how -long Mr. Tremaine had been married, and Tom answering that that very day had made him the happiest of men, the young ladies could not help a little shout, that roused the whole table of four or five hundred persons, and made Mrs. Thomas Tremaine's cheek redder than the finest rose in her father's garden. "You didn't see us come aboard at Red Fort?" inquired Tom, dexterously heading off further in- terrogatories. "No, indeed!" cried the Langfords. "Mrs. Tremaine's father has a place there," he observed-" you can see it from the water-a stone house with a white piazza, and a garden leading to the Fort-you remember it, I dare say.

This lady, whose name was also Langford, was a native of Mrs. Blake's native island, as her exquisite ac- cent and refined mode of speaking declared, for she belonged to its highest class. She might be five and thirty, was a widow, it seemed, though she wore no weeds, with a beautiful little girl of ten or twelve at her side, like a bud and a rose on one stem, and the simile was never more appropriate. Mrs. Langford was a beauty without any figure of speech, one of the rare instances of unblemished female loveliness She had the rose and lily com- plexion of the North, the raven hair and liquid black eyes of Spain, the grand, harmonious features of Greece or Circassia, the form of the fabled Juno in the tripe, unalterable bloom of her immortality.

Mrs. Langford's manners were as faultless as her person, and even her simple travelling habit displayed the perfection of her taste in dress, indication of that love of pleasing without which woman would cease to please. This she was when in repose, but her finest charm was in movement, when she discovered all the poetry of motion, to rivet the fascination of the beholder. She stepped like a queen on the steiiboat-deck, so that involuntarily every one turned to; look at her. As the poet says- "Grace was in all her steps, In every gesture dignity and love." And withal there was a glow about her, a warmth of feeling, a womanly quickness of appre- hension and sympathy, in which Xanthine recog- nized the Celt. She was capable of sarcasm, too, this perfectly organized and accomplished creature, and Xanthe quickly perceived that she regarded her nieces as a kind of amiable and well-dressed barbarians. She seemed at once to comprehend Xanthine from some superior stand-point of her own, and by a few words won her way into the young bride's artless confidence. These kind loa   THE WEDDING TOUR.      288 dies, in short, took possession of young Mrs. Tre- maine, and having sent the whiskerandos of the party, of whom young Langford was loth to be got rid of, about their business, were soon fully acquaint. ed with all that their curiosity was itching to know touching the particulars of her stolen marriage- the morning rendezvous, the Church ceremonial, the hotel breakfast, the scene at home, the paren- tal forgiveness and the tearful parting. The Langford girls wondered and' laughed, and joked one another thereaient, so familiarly and gaily, that Xanthine speedily felt as if they were so many sisters ; while the superb and winning Mrs. Langford took (it would seem) such a wonderful liking to her fronm her story, and showed, at any rate, such a tender interest in her concerns, that Xan- thine could have regarded her as a mother, had she been a trifle older. Xanthe thought that life was in a manner opening upon her. And here, indeed, were I to go on and relate all that happened on that memorable evening, even between Xanthine and her new friends, I should bring down upon myself the outcries of those who are very sensitive upon such points, for approach- ing too near the awful secrets of wedlock, nearer, at all events, than a superannuated bachelor has any right to come.

The intimacy was a noble friendship on her side, (for- getting or overlooking my want of merit,) but on mine fell little short of worship, though I never so far lost sight of the unworthiness before mentioned as to breathe such a thing to her. She was very entertaining on the incidents of this evening. "fThose girls (said she) were giggling together about something of which they dared not speak openly. At last, my Grace (child-like), their cous- in, got hold of it by teasing, and forthwith whis- pered her mamma, who, you may be sure, chid her, saying (with a blush, I warrant), 'Nonsense, child!' --' But the girls say there is one,' persists Grace.- 'One what? demands young Mrs. Tremaine.--' A bridal state room,' promptly answers my girl, in a loud: whisper-' now is there, Mrs. Tremaine? ' At that, the other girls cry out, reproving her, and threaten never to tell her another secret. But Mrs. T., blushing no more than became her, replies, 'Of course!' affecting gayety. She blushed (I'm certain) fdr her tall coxcomb, who had foolishy en- gaged without her knowledge (as she assured me) that distinguished apartment, of which I bad never   THE W VPDDIN TOUTS.     285 before heard.

Well, there, as I live, was the prettiest French chambre d coucher imaginable, but so small you could hardly turn round in't. The curtains were rich white silk damask looped with silver, the coverlet of white mering embroidered, the pillows and sheets trim- med with real Brussels. The couch was inlaid work, the wash-hand set of the finest Rose de Se- vres, the chairs covered with white satin, and an elegant tiny toilet to match, with a plate mirror reflecting all, by the light of two wax tapers (which the girls lighted) in silver sconces (or I Won't swear but they were plated). The carpet was of white roses. Wasn't it ridiculous? That fair and quick- witted Mrs. Tremaine was one rosy blush all the time.- It was the. strangest thing I have seen this side the water." "'Tis an advertisement to the line," said I, in explanation.

The idea has been ridiculed, as we all know, but has kept its place, and now every new hotel in Gotham has its bridal chamber, fitted up with a lavish magnificence that might content an Empress on her wedding-night, to grace the costly sacrifice she makes to the sacred welfare of the State; which is no costher, say our republicans, than that of the simplest maiden, and merits no greater pomp to deck it. This incident must naturally have annoyed our Xanthine, but it was turned into a fresh consolation reserved for her by a good Providence, for it hap- pened that Mrs. Langford to her other perfections added the crowning one of a piety without either morosenessWor tepidity, and when the silk-lined nest of the Aquatica had been fully viewed, and the young people had quitted it, that gracious lady, holding back her daughter by one hand, turned sweetly to Xanthine and said, holding up a small black chaplet,-"Shall we say our night-prayers together, my dear Mrs. Tremaine?

So the generous and feeling matron cheered the lonely and trembling heart of the young bride by the efficacy of social prayer-the strongest and sweetest thing on earth, from which the participa- tion of an unsullied child detracted nothing, I warrant, in the sight of Heaven, nor would such a three-fold cord as that be easily broken. And when their hearts were opened by this delightful and elevating process, I can well imagine dittle as I know of such matters) that Xanthine could want in that narrow privacy of a steamboat state-room, neither a judicious friend nor a tender mother, nor pertinent advice for frank encouragement. I won't be bail that Providence will always serve runaways in that fashion, nor even those who in all things are obedient: but I set it down for the comfort of all who are misused, unfairly treated, deserted and frowned upon, that such is the moment when Heaven is most piteous, most considerate for them, and sends them the purest rayof its sunshine and the gentlest dew of its blessing. That Xanthine herself was keenly feeling every phase of her new existence, may be inferred, and ample evidence of it is found in her papers. I find a sonnet which is said (on the back of it) to have been written in '"the silken nest of the Aquatica,"    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6851-00000145"/> ^8 8     Bl-ONDE A-D: BBRUNRTE. n t :lQng, apparently, after she came on board, "while.

If some people find a tone of Pagan sentiment in the verses of our Xanthine, and some, it may be, a freedom of expression more than they quite approve, it must be remembered that she wrote for no human eye but her own, and that the sentiments are to be taken, as we have before hinted, partly as conven- tional-borrowed from Xanthe's reading in the classic authors of the isle and the, age just mention- ed, of which her father had so choice a collection. I dare say that Xanthine did (to tell the truth) look at life just then from an aspect of the human affec- tions, with a warm, glowing hope of earthly enjoy- ment.. There is a kind of Paganism, no doubt, in that state of mind; youth, health, beauty and hap- piness are four inveterate Pagans; I am notdisposed to deny that.

Tomi reallycaled not a straw for many things that vividly interested Xanthine, and regarded in the most mat- ter of-fact point of view those special ones which awed, exalted and attracted herthe most. Indeed, on some points, had Xanthine been a woman of the new philos10phic'alf-sentimental sch1ool, like the cele- brated heroine. Jieanette .F^'er, m the novel .f Madaemoiselle loche, she would have discovered -that they were antipathic.

' and be- take herself to her own devotions with a forced smile, and a secret tear, that dropped over the book.  There is a particular reason why the irreligious ness of a husband should wound a wife, who, with. out being a violent devotee, -hs a strong and rather elevated sense of religion; and especially if she has a fine imagination, as Xanthine had, which is a great supporter of religiousness. The irreligious temper is essentially an animal way of looking at things, and of course extends to all the relations of life. Wedlock, for instance (there it comes home to wo- men), has its spiritual aspect in the union of souls, and is hallowed in a chaste Woman's ;eyes, by the religious mystery it- represents; the union of bodies is but the matter of the sacrament, the vulgar and material part, and without the other is but brutish; a high-souled woman feels. herself degraded by it, and hence (apart from all other considerations, which- it is none- of my business to discuss) :mist- be sensibly wounded, I say, by the wanit or notable    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6851-00000148"/> dtefcisnr'--ofthat element in her husband which would disposed him to view their union in its nobler light. Many have sought a definition of love, and have given very silly ones. As man is an animal with reason, so human love (philosophically consid- ered) is the animal instinct determined to one object by the -rational part of humanity. But this last, all experience proves, possesses a permanent empire only on condition of an alliance with a power above humanity.' So love can be permanent only when it is guaranteed by a mysterious consecration from worlds uniseen-, and the lasting dearness of love's material sign, its triumph over satiety and sensual fickleness, comes from the spiritual mystery, from the divine sacrament, which makes the wedded "' twain in one flesh.' Therefore we see why, when this consecrating idea is lost or weakened, the per- minence of the wedded union is assailed by divorce, and its unity is invaded by polygamy; for-love itself has disappeared, (the human attribute,) and brute' appetite has taken its place. Domestic peace, true wedded joys, nuptial happiness, conjugal fidelity; chaste love, well-ordered families, tender parents, obedient children, loving brothers and sisters, all are no more. The' State is uprooted, the bond' of human society is dissolved, labor has lost its   THE WBEDDING ,TOUR  motive, industry its reward, barbarism ..is apr proaching; because without the- religious mys- tery no marriage, without marriage no love, with- out love (men being then but brutes,)-no-true mankind, It is with reaspn, then, that this love is made of so much importance, for here is the life of so- ciety situated: this is the vital spot. Nor can there be a more violently unequal conjunction than between one who reverences the mystery on which love rests, and one who does not even perceive it. That was the thorn which pricked Xanthine under the rose of her nuptial ihappiness, and to the very quick. She herself about this time feelingly ex- pressed it in the following lines.- They were writ- ten towards the end of her honeymoon, while they were stopping for a week of lovely weather in a fine grazing valley hemmed in by green picturesque mountains, where the well-cleared uplands were covered with flocks of sheep of choice breeds. These noble pastures were enclosed by groves of chestnut and oak, and sprinkled with fine maples which produced in the spring of the year quan- tities of delicious sugar, and in summer afforded a thick and grateful shade. Under such a tree they would throw themselves upon the grass to rest, where there were no lookers-on but only the sheep    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6851-00000149"/> ^0   .

Tom brought it her after breakfast, while she was sitting on the sunny side of the house, in the upper piazza, enjoying the solar warmth mixed with the freshness of the mountain atmosphere. She ex- - claimed with delight, and broke the seal with eagerness. Of course it was written very fine, on extrjly thin foreign post, and crossed with red ink I :Fwas a morning's work to read it through, epecially as she read it aloud to Tom, as follows: - LONDRA, Aug. 20, 18-. "'MY DEAR EST XANTHE, :'ou have no doubt heard by my short letter to nmma, of iesafe arrival in Albion, &amp;:c I   v MELTS LrTEI.-     299 w-. g -y  '           age must now give you a short account of our voyage and travels si nd we landed.

By the by, dear, we have just got the dear letters from home, and one containing such intelligence f It took us by surprise, Ipromise you. Oh, you naughty runaway! But I must not chide you, darling,-I suppose- you could not help it. Only it does strike me that Father R. acted rather queer--to give you all the benedic- tions, and yours a stolen match, and refuse them to me, who was married under my father's roof! Donald is rather scandalized by it, which makes me care more than I otherwise should. -Not that I envy your happiness, dearest, to kneel inside the, altar for the blessings of the Church and all, though I wonder (as Donald does) if the privilege can have been fairly purchased. But pray give brother Tom- a sisterly kiss for me, and tell him honestly I hope he did not obtain my Xanth on false prtces. Does this sound tart, dearest? 'Tis only :i:',long way -across the ocean that turns the sweetness into sour, (as you would say, dear,) for my eyes are brimful of tears of tenderness every word I write, and I do (in sober earnest) loveyou both dealy.

If I try, I shall in into fustian. Let's see. 'The mighty steamship ifrrows the bosom of the deep, regardless of its impatient heaving and -of its wild surges, cleaving, too, the atmosphere apart with the irresistible wedge of its sharply-mied prow, defeating all the endeavors of the offended air to arrest, by a head wind, (which we had all the way,) the progress of this new po- tentate of motion, who disdains its ancient help and mocks at its fruitless opposition t' What recks the royal Oceanica, her fiery heart constantly beating, and her broad vans (that's the paddles) scourging the envious and irritated waters into a ragingfoam?

Donald impertinently looks over my shoulder, and laughs so much at the above, that I've  nd to scratch it out. To own the honest tr::u id not enjoy the steamer so much as I would have done a sailing-vessel. Indeed there was but one advantage I could discover in the former, that it was sooner over, like the pulling of a:to ef:by a skilful dentist.

(Donald looks over again, and laughs and cries' Fie! '-who cares?) Well, a steamer is just like that, from all I can learn, compared to a ship, I was sick all the time. You know I paid my devoirs to Nep- tune that first evening, going round Point Deborah, on our way to Shawmut, and as I told you the next morning, passed the whole night on deck, curled up on a bale of goods, just- sayv ; the open air from deadly nausea.

McAboy, you must-know, dear, had mounted a blue bonnet already, and threatened to put on the kilt, but I would not hear of it then! However, I allowed him a plaid against the cold mists which I expected to meet, half enveloping the ancient castle, and the -toplin' craigs aboon it.

I can say with my handi on my heart, (his hand is on it,) that I love and honor my Donald ten thousand times more than I did two months since, and that I have not found a single reason, but only one, which I knew before, (wicked that I am and wickedly hap- py,) for repenting of my choice. -Oh, my darling! iy prayer and my hope is that you may always be able to say the same. So we've come down through old Anglia like lightning again. Donald's portfolio is fiill. of sketches, and he is giving about a fort- night to-the private galleries in London, to which we have-gained free access by the letters Mr. De Grotiusand 'Uncle James' gave us.

Xanthine sighed while she kissed her sister's signature, with such sisterly warmth as if d fain have kissed the writer across the oce She    <pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6851-00000154"/> 80ft    BLONDE ANDY BRUETTlE. observed that Mel seemed very happy. Tom wished that Melanie had enlarged a little more on the high life personages she mentioned in the conclusion, and had narrated what and how much she saw-of them. "I should have been better pleased," quoth Xanth, " had she enlarged more on every thing. I expecte ito hear about the royal palaces and the castles of nobility, and the parks and old cathe- dralsi besides the galleries of pictures all at full length, like a painter's bride; but it is just her own honeymoon," cried she, laughing, "and we know what that is as well as she." If Xanthe had been a classical scholar, she would have remembered what the poet says of those who seek distant lands, "that they change their sky, but not their mind," and then might also have occurred to her what is writ about " atra cura," only it was not black Care that sat behind Melanie McAboy, but young Love who sat before her, with his rosy limbs astride of her equestrian knee, guiding her bridle-hand, (the mischievous urchin,) without her being aware. There were passages of Mel's letter, over which Xanthe cried afterwards, when she re-read it alone. Not that Xanthe was unhappy; but that she was in some measure disappointed in Tom, she could not deny; and Mel seemed perfectly content.   XANTH'S E-R LEtlOiS.      307 "Yet Mel's marriage," thought she,   was not blessed by the Church, and mine was! Can it be because hers was approved by father and mother, and mine a runaway affair?

As lessens one, the other grows; No rayless pit fair Nature knows; By day, by night, alike she glows; Now all her noon-day lustre throws; Now wakes the splendor with repose, Of moon or star-graced night.

AT last a letter from Alford-short, pithy, ur- gent-summoned the Tremaines back to Gotham. "I saw your uncle Jim to-day," wrote Alford. "He wishes you to bring your wife to his house till you can get settled. There's more news which I will impart by word of mouth. My complimepts to the charming Mrs. Tremaine." "That's doosid kind of Uncle Jim," quoth Tom. "I wonder what the other news is."  Well, I hope we shan't trespass long on your uncle's hospitality," cries Xanthe. i"I would rather live in a garret, as Donald wanted Mel to do, and do my own work." So Xanthe packed the trunks, while Tremaine bespoke seats in the stage that passed through the village that very morning.  *  , in  I -;h    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6851-00000156"/> CHAPTER XXVIII. THE BELLS "BROUGHT HOME." THE sun was scarcely risen as the hackney-coach stopped before the lofty portal of Mr. James McA- boy's semi-castellated mansion of brown stone- that beautiful material of modern Gotham, which he was almost the first to introduce. The first considerable mansion built of it was, however, the PaUadian pile still inhabited by our friend i De Grotius. : Early aswas the hour, the hack-driver could not ring the bell before the rich oak doors were- thrown open by the -servants, twho were' ex- cepting the arrival of the young couple, and who received them with a zealous welcome due to the affable and generous disposition of Tremaine. Xanthine-, glanced with innocent awe and admi- dri o at the stately hall into which she was now- for the first time admitted,-its marble pavement, (then' ae nm Gotham,) 'massive oak-grained tair- case,; Goth doorways opening, and dome of   THE BELLS "BROUGfIT HOME."   3" colored glass. Up the broad and easy stair, car- peted with velvet, and sparkling with statues, ar- mor, and bronzes, she followed the tripping maid. servant, to a corridor (as Xanthe said) like that of an old castle, and so to a lofty and sumptuous chamber. Here thei bedstead and furniture was also of oak, richly carved and superbly upholstered. "Why, it is a perfect palace, Tom," cried she. "The finest establishment in Gotham," said Tom, who knew them all. It was necessary that Mrs. Tremaine should apply herself immediately to the affair of the morn- ing toilet. A door of the apartment opened. into a "lovely" bath-room. In about an hour and a half young Mrs. Tremaine was ready, and, her hus- band -having surveyed her pretty neglige with a critical but satisfied air,--he only moved an amend- ment to her little matronly lace cap,-they went down together to the breakfast-room. Tommight criticize, but I don't know what other man could, that dewy morning bloom and fresh and simple toilette. A white-haired gentleman, with a Roman beak, piercing gray eye and florid complexion, looked up from his newspaper as they entered, and after a glane of deliberate inspection, rose, advanced with cordiality, and kissed Xathine affectionately on both cheeks.    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6851-00000157"/> "Welcome to your future home, my child," said the old gentleman. "And by the way, break- ffat is ready. Will you take your place at the urn, Mrs. Tremaine? "With the greatest pleasure in life," says Xanthine, gayly, "as long as you will be an old bachelor, sir."- -  "Ah-!" said Mr. McAboy, "had I met a face asbright as yours when I was of this puppy's age, I should not be an old bachelor now, believe me.' ;, Xanthv0inewas installed, at once as mistress in thespilendid mansion of UncleJames. Tom was thus virtualy acknowledged as his uncles principal heir. In fact, Uncle James had only Tremaine and Donald to whom to leave his fortune, nor could heAdo lbtter than divide the bulk of it between them. ; The immediate enjoyment of so excellentra worldly osition Tom. owed in part to the beauty, mg ;neand: winning gayety -of his young wife, and in- part tot the intervention of that clever Aford. AlfiorMd had represented to Mr. McAboy that the proper way to mollify old Blake towards Tom, so as 1t secure Xanthine's portion for his[ nephew. w'as to. make Tremaiie a good match for the girl,: evn ionsiderinher expectations. So Aiforiwas authrized to,. promise. Tremaine a provision equa   THE BELLS "BROUGHT HOME."    313 to that which Mr. Blake should make for Xanthine. Mr. Blake was at first obdurate. Not a cint of his money, he had said it, should any Tom Tremaine ever finger, and not a cint he should. "All such promises," observed Alford, astutely, "are made either to be broken, or to be kept only in the letter. It is not necessary for Mr. Blake to give any of his money to Tom, or in such a way that Tom can ever finger it. That is easily ar- ranged." In fine, Alford drew up a codicil to Mr. Blake's will, devising and bequeathing to his son, Patrick Bailey Blake, and to Mr. Bradley Alford, one hun- dred thousand dollars in trust 'for his' daughter Xanthine, the interest to be paid to her, for her sole use and benefit, and so forth, as tight as the law could make it. Mr. McAboy, on his part, with true Scotch thrift, commuted his legacy for an an- nuity of $5,000 to Tom, secured by deed of trust, and commencing immediately. "But I must have a quic for my quo," said Uncle James;-it was a standing McAboy jest,- "and that pretty Mrs. Xanthine must keep house for me, and make my Gothic palace cheerful for the rest of my days.", Patrick Blake thought that Uncle James had the best of the bargain. But when was' a Hiber- "    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6851-00000158"/> 314     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. nian a match for a Caledonian Celt, at that kind of game?  Donald and Melanie spent two years in Europe, and returned,-.Donald full of genius, studies, fame, arid gold. They did not go to Uncle Jamie's on their arrival, but to papa Blake's, whence in a month or so, the McAboys migrated into a house of their own, which Donald's taste made the very ideal of an artist's residence. In a few months after they took possession of it, Melanie's son- Patrick Jamie Friedrich McAboy-was born. Mel was very happy-was she not?-with the most gifted husband, the most beautiful child, the prettiest house, not to say in Gotham, almost in the world.  I do not think, however, that Donald's works were altogether worthy of his genius or his fame, or of the position which he undeniably held among artists. They were beautiful, careful, scholarly pic- tures, faultless in color and drawing, and finely mo- tived-but somehow they did not speak right to the popular heart. He got very high pricesfor them, and was highly appreciated by all connoisseurs. Mr. De Grotius used to buy one now and then, and sometimes sold them again. I have heard Manuel Seijas complain that Donald's women were all too much like his wife, or his still more beautiful sister- in-law.   THE BELLS "BROUGHT HOME."    315 The beauty of the latter would go far to excuse any artist for copying such a model. Her golden tresses surpassed the mistresses of Titian, and her countenance (in Donald's pictures, I mean) was as divinely spiritual as her form was luxuriant. Me- lanie was half jealous of her husband's great par- tiality for Xanthine's classic loveliness. Yet Xanthine's happiness had so many draw- backs that it is a wonder her lustrous and undu- lating beauty was neither dimmed nor wasted. Tremaine's habits could not be called good. He resumed from the time of their return to Uncle Jamie's, the profession of a saunterer, and pursued it with an application worthy of a better calling. Billiards were his business, play his excitement, drink his consolation. If he avoided some gross and perilous indulgences, yet the possession of the loveliest woman in Gotham did not render him a perfectly faithful spouse. He grew handsomer as he grew older, and in the brilliant but corrupt so- ciety of the commercial capital, continued to be the favorite of one sex, and the leader of the other.  Then they had no children. The cares and duties of maternity would have sufficiently occu- pied Xanthine's heart and time, to make her almost forget the irregularities, and less sensibly feel the    <pb n="316-317 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6851-00000159"/> 316     BLONDE AND BRUNETTE. too frequent neglect of her husband. But deprived of this resource, the vacancy in her heart and the inward pain that too often rankled there, drove her to seek occupation and solace in the exercise of her rare imaginative faculty. The impassioned poetry and heart-touching tales which we owe to the pen of Mrs. Tremaine, could never have em-l anated from her, had her internal equalled, in calm felicity, her exterior lot. We may encounter her again in the history of another career, and if so, the perusal of this inartificial tale will aid in ex- plaining her character. THE END.
