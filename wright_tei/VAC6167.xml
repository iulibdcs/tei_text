                  <p>Two centuries ago, there lived in Magdebourg, a family that presented a
                     striking example of the effects of labor and economy. There was not one who did
                     not know and esteem honest Wilhelm Grusner, the master-carpenter. All that he
                     possessed was his industry and his two sons,<pb n="4-5"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000003"/> Albert and Cornelio. Grusner had founded an
                     establishment, if not sumptuous and important, at least honest and respectable.
                     Of course, it will be supposed that he made his sons two aids-de-camp. Albert
                     was particularly useful to him, and it would have been very hard to decide
                     whether "Wilhelm or Albert worked the most assiduously at his daily task. So
                     Albert, though only twenty-two, was as much esteemed as those who are many
                     years older, and more experienced. There was not a mother who did not wish him
                     for her son-in-law; his future life seemed clearly traced before him.</p>
                  <p>It was not so with Cornelio, (baptized with this Italian name on account count
                     of his having had for godfather a sign painter from Milan). Cornelio, who had
                     attained his eighteenth year, had no particular inclination for his father's
                     trade; he became more and more tired of the compass, the rule, the plane and
                     the hammer. On the other hand, he conceived for painting a perfect enthusiasm.
                     Had he any spare money, he quickly spent it for pencils and colors; then he
                     would employ the precious hours that should be devoted to his work, at tracing
                     out shapeless sketches—for the poor stripling artist had but nature to direct
                     him, and in his behalf nature had not been as liberal as she had been to
                     Carregio, Claude Lorraine, and other geniuses so richly<pb n="6-7"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000004"/> gifted. Cornelio had more ambition than means to
                     attain his end. In the first place he would have required a master, but he had
                     none. Wilhelm Grusner was always furious whenever he found in his house a
                     strayed paint brush, and he thrust his hand through more than one piece of
                     canvas.</p>
                  <p>"That's it!" cried the carpenter, "more daubings, more nonsense! Why lose so
                     much time and money in things that will never be of any use? Believe the sense
                     of a workman and the tenderness of a father; it is not right that you should
                     have notions that later will be pernicious to you. Cease, then, your painting,
                     and follow the example of your brother er. Ah! he is a workman, he is, and I
                     predict that he will make his way."</p>
                  <p>As one may well imagine, Cornelio, though respectful towards his parents did
                     not want for excuses to oppose those paternal remonstrances. He always
                     undertook to cite the example of artists crowned by fame, but he did not name
                     such as had died either in misery or despair. In those kind of struggles,
                     Cornelio was, it is true, seconded by his mother, who adopted, without reserve,
                     all her son's ideas. So then, whilst the father was proud of the work and the
                     practical skill of his Albert, Madam Grusner was puffed up with the artistic
                     efforts of her Cornelio.</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6167-00000005"/>
                  <p>There came a moment when one should give up to the other: it was Grusner. And
                     when he had a right to command, he swerved from his severity so that Mina; his
                     wife, should not be afflicted. Cornelio is now at liberty to follow his
                     inclination for painting. He multiplies the number of his sketches, his
                     portraits, his frescoes, and there was not a wall in his father's house but
                     what was covered with colors by the apprentice-painter. He felt very happy when
                     an order was given for the first portrait. One of the wealthiest traders of the
                     fair of Dantzick, Master Petrus Greinlich had confided to Cornelio the care of
                     handing down to posterity his own remarkable effigy, and Cornelio nelio gave
                     him the worth of his money. Petrus Greinlich was delighted to see that the
                     artist had made him a superb velvet doublet, bound with orange-colored satin, a
                     real lace collar, and a hat with feathers; the whole figuring on the
                     perspective of a palace.</p>
                  <p>"You will be a great artist!" exclaimed the brave trader, quite flattered at
                     having it so cheap.</p>
                  <p>"Now, you see, my dear," said Mina to the carpenter, "that I was right to favor
                     our son's vocation."</p>
                  <p>But the carpenter shook his head in token of incredulity.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, Wilhelm Grusner was struck with apoplexy, and he died
                     whilst uttering those sorrowful<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6167-00000006"/> rowful
                     and prophetic words: "Poor Cornelio! poor Cornelio!"</p>
                  <p>"Well," said Master Greinlich, one day as he entered the house of widow
                     Grusner, "now there, my young artist, you must not be so grieved. You have shed
                     enough tears, and you have sufficiently proved your filial piety. Work in its
                     turn must take its place. Resume your painting."</p>
                  <p>"But, my dear Mr. Greinlich, what can I do? I am so disheartened!"</p>
                  <p>"I have good news to communicate to you. The respectable curate of our
                     metropolis has seen my likeness, he is delighted with it, and he immediately
                     determined upon confiding to you the decorations of a chapel."</p>
                  <p>"To me!" exclaimed Cornelio, moved and excited with joy.</p>
                  <p>"To you, my dear friend, yes, to you. To-morrow you can begin the
                     undertaking."</p>
                  <p>With reason has it often been said, that men consider very little whether they
                     are suitable for holding certain situations, as long as those situations suit
                     them. So Cornelio accepted the good offer that was made, without reflecting if
                     it were not more prudent to refuse it. To enter upon such a serious
                     undertaking, thorough knowledge arid set rules would have been necessary, but
                     where had Cornelio learned the science which the task demanded? Nevertheless he
                     accepted it, As soon as the scaffolding was<pb n="12-13"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000007"/> ready, he mounted it, full of ardor and vanity.
                     Indeed it was curious to see his hair standing upright, his flashing eyes, his
                     compressed lips, he having all the appearance of one inspired perhaps minus the
                     inspiration. As he leaned on the edge of the scaffolding, he took care to look
                     if he were observed, then he would assume an authoritative attitude.</p>
                  <p>What a pity he made such bad use of the brush that he handled so well, and that
                     he had but the hat and dress of Titian; otherwise let us pardon him his little
                     extremes of vanity. It is next to an impossibility that the first success does
                     not produce like effects.</p>
                  <p>From morning till night Cornelio was there in his chapel, dabbling zealously
                     against the walls, which would have probably complained if they had had a
                     tongue. Our artist sought most assiduously the display of flashy colors; and
                     neither did he spare sky-blue, chrome-yellow, or scarlet-red. At a distance you
                     would have taken it to be an aviary of birds of paradise. From time to time
                     good artists came and cast an ironical glance on the work, but Cornelio did not
                     heed them, or else he attributed those demonstrations of criticism to pure
                     jealousy. "Rivals!" cried he, "envious fellows! We well know what it
                     signifies." And to put a stop to the underhand jealousy of those he called his
                     enemies, he enclosed his<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6167-00000008"/> chapel in
                     vast draperies. He hoped by this means to obtain great success by surprise on
                     the inaugural day. He had already conceived in his mind the praise he was to
                     receive, and the words he would return in thanks. A conquering king would not
                     feel more important on entering his capital. What disappointment for poor
                     Cornelio, when the day that was to ring forth his triumph had come!</p>
                  <p>A great crowd composed mostly of artists, writers, clergy, worldly men, were
                     there in the body of the chapel, waiting for the painter to draw aside his
                     tapestry hangings. The resounding bass-voice of Master Greinlich exclaimed:
                     "See now if my protoge is not worthy of the honor granted him. Oh! when I
                     interest myself about people, I take care to know them well, and esteem them
                     according to their merits."</p>
                  <p>The examination took place; we shall not say that there were various opinions,
                     various criticisms, nor that they came to blows, nor tore each other's hair, to
                     defend more or less the merit of the work. An unanimous opinion prevailed
                     throughout the crowd; it was manifested by the loudest, the heartiest, and the
                     most prolonged, laugh that had ever been heard in Germany. Petrus Greinlich
                     himself, seeing the general hilarity, contrived, as he struck his big stomach,
                     to laugh outright as the rest.</p>
                  <p>Cornelio, pale, mute, and confounded<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6167-00000009"/>
                     ed, did not at first understand the nature of this demonstration; he was even
                     at a loss to conjecture its cause. But he could not so far doubt of his own
                     merit as to misunderstand the general feeling. A cold sweat trickled down his
                     forehead, his knees bent under him, and the unhappy man sank down upon a bench
                     that chance had very fortunately placed near him. The shouts continued to be
                     heard, and Cornelio, as if moved by some sudden impulse, rose up, muttering in
                     a groaning tone, "My God! my God!" He opened a small door, marked by the
                     woodwork, and opening into a hall that led to one of the side entries off the
                     church. The air of the street brought him a little to his senses. He ran on
                     precipitately, and only stopped to breathe when he arrived near his father's
                     house.</p>
                  <p>There, again, Cornelio was struck with a novel sight, contrasting, however,
                     with the one of which he had been a witness. On a little square on which was
                     situated the house of the Grusner family, a crowd of people was assembled,
                     their appearance was bold and picturesque, their costume simple, popular, and
                     poetic. Those men wore beaver hats or caps on the side of their heads, and
                     brown woollen cloaks on their shoulders. Their demeanor betokened a spirit of
                     independence, and a stern gravity which did not exclude gayety. They all gazed
                     towards the house, as if expecting<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6167-00000010"/> ing
                     some one or something. A window opened. Albert appeared on the wooden balcony,
                     then the robust lungs of all those tradesmen shouted forth a thousand bravos,
                     whilst the words re-echoed, "Long live Albert Grusner, the King of
                        Carpenters!<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

                        epoch, the greater number of associations of tradesmen elected a king on a

                        parish.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>In one group Cornelio heard these words, which mortified him exceedingly:
                     "Albert is, indeed, worthy of the homage which we pay him. He is a good and
                     brave tradesman! He has not his equal in all Magdeburg. He is not like his lazy
                     brother, who shuns his father's trade to be an artist."</p>
                  <p>Yes," said another voice, "but I'm sure his behavior will bring him
                     ill-luck"</p>
                  <p>In Cornelio's present state of mind, this sorrowful prediction excited still
                     more his exasperation. Forgetting all caution, he approached the group and
                     exclaimed, in a voice full of terror and anger: "That your evil warnings may
                     fall upon your own head, you fool! I am Cornelio, whose conduct you blame."</p>
                  <p>The man thus addressed, coolly replied:</p>
                  <p>"Your rage proves one thing, that you are in the wrong. If you had no remorse
                     of conscience, you would not shout so loud."</p>
                  <p>This sensible answer, instead of<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6167-00000011"/>
                     calming the artist, enraged him the more, and he cried: "Cursed be this town!
                     cursed be its inhabitants! I shall go seek justice elsewhere! and never shall I
                     put my foot into this house, where vulgar labor receives the honors due to
                     genius!"</p>
                  <p>As he finished this abrupt declamation, he retraced his steps, dashed through
                     the crowd, and disappeared."</p>

                  <p>Indeed Cornelio had no particular view when he left Magdeburg—no thought for
                     the future, and, we could add, no means. He had thought but of one thing—to
                     escape from the scene of his humiliation—to hear no longer the sarcasms
                     pronounced against his paintings, and the acclamations that welcomed his
                     brother. Such feelings were condemnable: whosoever runs the risk of criticism,
                     and flatters himself with high expectations, should endure animadversions
                     patiently. Secondly, the success of a brother should rejoice, and<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000012"/> not grieve the heart; hut so it was! Cornelio
                     was deaf to all but the turbulent voice of his passions.</p>
                  <p>He wandered away from his native city; he rushed on breathless and exhausted,
                     insensible to the beautiful scenery and to the monuments which presented
                     themselves to his view. What had become of this love of art, this desire to
                     contemplate the masterpieces of great men? Since the hour of his departure,
                     Cornelio had not entered a church. An irresistible movement led him on, not
                     knowing what road he was following.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the absolute want of money stopped him Exhausted, too proud to solicit
                     public charity, our traveller sank down at the angle of a wall, determined to
                     wait stoically that hunger which would deliver him from the wretchedness of
                     this life. A rough voice made him shudder.</p>
                  <p>"Well, what is it? said some one.</p>
                  <p>"There's a fine looking fellow, pale and emaciated."</p>
                  <p>Without answering, Cornelio raised his eyes and saw before him a robust
                     personage of dark complexion, and of eccentric costume, his belt filled with
                     daggers and pistols, like a corsair or highwayman.</p>
                  <p>"I perceive," said this man, "that fatigue has overcome you. Drink first a
                     little of this," and he handed him a gourd, "Then we shall make
                     acquaintance."</p>
                  <p>A little of this genuine liquor revived<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6167-00000013"
                     /> vived Cornelio, who, of a naturally confiding disposition, had soon made the
                     unknown man acquainted with his sad experience.</p>
                  <p>"In return," said the latter, "I shall also speak frankly. My name is Ralph
                     Dickson; the sea is my country; with a few brave companions, I have undertaken
                     expeditions and followed the glorious example of Christopher Columbus, Americus
                     Vespucci, Vasco de Gama. Such a trade affords honor and profit. Each of our
                     voyages would enrich a whole city, with the quantity of gold and precious
                     stones we amass and bring back. It is the thirst of adventures, the hope of new
                     discoveries that tempts us incessantly to risk our own lives. Just now I am
                     charged to recruit, here and there, strong and able companions, who would
                     replace those whom fever, fights, and storms have carried off, for I will not
                     deceive you, there is great peril in our trade. You appear perfectly disgusted
                     with the existence you have heretofore had, and you seemingly wish to shun your
                     fellow-citizens. The best way then is to follow us. Take part in our
                     undertakings and you will reap great advantage."</p>
                  <p>The prospect of adventure pleased Cornelio, who made few objections to the
                     shrewd manœuvres of Captain Ralph. He consented to go.</p>
                  <p>Two days after the above conversation, Cornelio embarked at Hamburg<pb
                        n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6167-00000014"/> burg on the ship <hi rend="i"/>Pluton.
                     She was a fine sailing vessel, and she was amply furnished with war provisions.
                     Though our former artist was of a hardy and adventurous disposition, his
                     inexperience in the art of navigation soon drew upon him the railleries of his
                     companions. Those men who hardly pronounced a word without blaspheming, were
                     ignorant of the first laws of politeness, arid they consequently threw aside
                     all restraint. To live for pleasure, to obtain money at all hazards, to spend
                     whilst on shore, to have always in hand, either a bottle or dice; such were
                     their habits. Cornelio's mind was too refined not to suffer by this contact,
                     and sometimes he would so far manifest fest his disgust as to wound the pride
                     of the pirates, who sought in every way to take revenge; they handled him
                     roughly, and more than one of them threatened to throw him overboard. If he
                     then had ever been in a way of painting, it would have afforded him some
                     consolation, but on the <hi rend="i"/>Pluton, arts were not spoken of; war and
                     pillage were their only occupations. The whole crew had sworn a ferocious
                     hatred to Cornelio, and such was his life when one night Ralph Dickson gathered
                     around him all his men on the deck.</p>
                  <p>"My friends," said he, "we shall now manœuvre cleverly, to gain a stand in the
                     little bay you see yonder, glimmering in the twilight. To-morrow<pb n="28-29"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000015"/> morrow, at dawn of day, a rich Spanish galleon,
                     the Trinidad, will pass this way to take in supplies. I am rightly informed.
                     Like tigers we shall rush upon this promised booty; if we succeed in taking it,
                     our fortune is made. Courage, then, and no quarters."</p>
                  <p>"No quarters!" repeated the pirates.</p>
                  <p>"Cornelio," resumed Ralph, "you are accused of being a coward. You dislike this
                     life—in a word, you tremble before danger."</p>
                  <p>"Who accuses me of that?" demanded Cornelio, whose eyes flashed with fury.</p>
                  <p>"Never mind," said the Captain, "It is essential that you put a stop to this
                     talk by your conduct henceforth. To-morrow you shall have the honor to be the
                     first to attack."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, Ralph; I shall prove that I am not a coward."</p>
                  <p>The next day, indeed, the Trinidad came in sight; the pirates manœuvered
                     tolerably well to ply windward, and to gain the broadside of the enemy, without
                     any particular damage. The grappling irons were cast.... Cornelio, with axe in,
                     hand, dashed forward, closely followed by his comrades, but no sooner had he
                     put his foot on the Spanish vessel, than he uttered a loud scream and threw
                     down his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Wretch! traitor!" howled the pirates, and one of them struck his<pb n="30-31"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000016"/> sword with all his might on the head of
                     Cornelio, who fell senseless on the deck.</p>
                  <p>However, the struggle raged on with inexpressible fury; life was at stake, and
                     no one asked or had mercy. The clashing of irons, the reports of fire-arms,
                     mingled with the horrible imprecations of the corsairs, the groans of the
                     wounded, and the death agony of the dying.</p>
                  <p>The beautiful weather, the splendor of the sun made a striking contrast with
                     this scene of desolation.</p>
                  <p>The right cause won. Repulsed on all sides, the freebooters were either obliged
                     to plunge into the sea, or reembark precipitately. They had left but one
                     prisoner in the hands of the Spaniards. It was Cornelio. The poor fellow,
                     horribly wounded, seemed, as it were, not belonging to this world. From time to
                     time he opened his eyes, feeling a little composed by the care that was given
                     him; but he had no knowledge of the situation, nor of the place he was in. Thus
                     the days passed on, and though slow, a change for the better took place.
                     Sometimes a well-known voice would affectionately whisper in his ear,
                     "Courage." This startled, but revived him. He heard them also say, "Do not yet
                     show yourself; excitement would prove fatal." At length this mystery ceased
                     when the sick man was nigh restored to his health. A man, who, by his
                     appearance and<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6167-00000017"/> his dress, seemed to be
                     the doctor of the ship, approached Cornelio, and said to him in a kind tone:
                     "My friend, yon were in very bad company, and in consideration of your being
                     wounded and a pirate, our brave sailors would have thrown you into the sea, if
                     it had not been that Providence sent you wonderful protection. Think over in
                     your mind of the name of your liberator."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, sir, I cannot say."</p>
                  <p>"You do not know," replied the doctor, with a smile. You are yet weak. I
                     understand .... that nevertheless, think again—perhaps memory may aid you. What
                     person in the world has your interest the most at heart?"</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" said Cornelio, sadly, "who could it be but my poor dear brother? But
                     what chance is there of my ever seeing him—above all, here? My brother that I
                     left stealthily—ungrateful that I am; for he was happy, honored—and vile
                     jealousy entwined my heart with her serpents. Oh, my good Albert, that you may
                     some day forgive me." ...</p>
                  <p>"I forgive you," said a voice that, he had already heard several times.</p>
                  <p>The convalescent screamed, opened his arms, and Albert was—folded to his
                     heart.</p>
                  <p>After this first and sweet emotion, a few explanations were exchanged. Cornelio
                     accused himself unceasingly.</p>
                  <p>"Hush! hush?" said Albert; "do<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6167-00000018"/> not
                     fatigue yourself; the doctor has forbidden excitement—listen then to me. At the
                     moment of your sudden disappearance the greatest inquietude overwhelmed us.
                     Having vainly searched for you in the town, we were convinced that you had left
                     Magdeburg. New researches were fruitless. . . My mother was dreadfully grieved.
                     But what was her despair when she learned accidentally that you had embarked on
                     a pirate vessel! Seeing her wasting away, sick, in danger, I offered to leave,
                     and go seek you, were it to the end of the world. God directed me, as I am now
                     near you, and that I can take you back to her who awaits you impatiently."</p>
                  <p>Cornelio, overwhelmed with emotion, pressed his brother's hands. Another
                     thought floated in his mind.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me why you are so thoughtful," tenderly asked Albert.</p>
                  <p>"Must I confess it?" answered Cornelio. "Indeed I dare not."</p>
                  <p>"Speak."</p>
                  <p>"Well then, I was thinking of the humiliations I experienced in our native
                     place. Have I been sufficiently scoffed at? How can I ever appear before my
                     fellow-citizens?"</p>
                  <p>"Have a little more philosophy, brother; if you are the first to laugh at this
                     mishap, no one will henceforth think of railing at you. In such cases it is
                     best to meet jokes halfway. Besides, Magdeburg does not worry<pb n="36-37"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000019"/> about the sign painter—Albert. 'Tis past, be
                     calm, I shall say no more; and when we shall have arrived at home, you then
                     will be at liberty to paint—I shall work for both of us."</p>
                  <p>At this last sentence Cornelio became absorbed in deep reflections.</p>
                  <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
                  <p>Three months after this event—for at that time vessels were not propelled by
                     steam—the two brothers entered Magdeburg. Albert, so as to deal gently with his
                     mother's sensitiveness, had already written to announce their speedy
                     return.</p>
                  <p>How their hearts beat as they knocked at the door! It was night. The house
                     seemed to be illuminated in an unusual manner. The servant opened the door; at
                     the sight of the brothers, she uttered a scream, and with one hand covered her
                     eyes flowing with tears.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter?" said, at the same time, Albert and Cornelio.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! Jesus-Maria! why have you returned?"</p>
                  <p>"Speak! speak!"</p>
                  <p>"My God! my God!"</p>
                  <p>"Why, speak, then, wretched woman!"</p>
                  <p>"Your poor mother—"</p>
                  <p>"Well?"</p>
                  <p>"Is dead!"</p>
                  <p>A double groan responded to this distressing news. The two brothers ascended
                     hastily, and as they crossed themselves they entered the room<pb n="38-39"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000020"/> where Mina was reposing. Both fell on their
                     knees sobbing, and sobbed out the words: "Mother! mother!"</p>
                  <p>A man who was religiously watching the dead woman, extended his hand to the
                     afflicted young men, and said, gravely, "Be strong, be resigned. Mina was tired
                     waiting for you, and she has gone to protect you from on high."</p>
                  <p>This friend, that Providence had sent there, was Greinlich.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! my poor mother," said Cornelio, "I alone have caused your death. Wretch
                     that I am, I have overwhelmed you with sorrow, and I arrive in time to behold
                     the result of my faults."</p>
                  <p>"Cornelio," said the old man, "God reserved for you this great lesson. Now you
                     can understand how much you were in the wrong to despise your father's
                     profession."</p>
                  <p>O! Mr. Greinlich! O! my mother! and you, my dearest brother, I take you now as
                     witness to my sincere repentance. From to-morrow I shall second you in your
                     labors; never shall I murmur, and believe me, that the worthless painter will
                     become an honest carpenter."</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>ONE of the severest winters known was that of 1709. In the rural districts
                     chiefly the poor were suffering from cold and hunger; thousands of families
                     were seen wandering about, covered with tatters, and begging for bread, that
                     public charity could not at all times grant them.</p>
                  <p>It is in Lorraine, which was then under Austria, where we find the hero of the
                     following story:</p>
                  <p>At the age of ten, Valentine Duval<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6167-00000023"/> was
                     left an orphan; after the death of his father and mother, he was alone and
                     desolate—having nothing to his name but misery. It were vain for him to solicit
                     the pity of the villagers, for they were as poor and as needful as Valentine
                     was himself. Nevertheless, with hope and courage, one meets if not fortune,
                     some favorable chance. This thought strengthened Valentine.</p>
                  <p>His village claimed him no longer.... "On the other hand, the world was wide
                     before him. He set out one morning, but before leaving he entered the humble
                     little church, and offered up one of those fervent prayers, which cannot fail
                     to be heard by our Father on high.</p>
                  <p>Valentine is on his way. Alas! how cold is the poor little orphan; he shivers,
                     his teeth chatter, his benumbed feet refuse to carry him, he is famished with
                     hunger; and besides, an unknown agony is wasting away his frail existence.
                     Twenty times is the weary little traveller on the point of stretching down oh
                     the snow, and awaiting in its icy shroud, an inevitable death. But a secret
                     voice, a divine presentiment urged him to take courage.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!" murmured the orphan—and he tottered on. At length he
                     perceives a tiled roof; oh, happiness! a house—a farm—there is hope....
                     Valentine presses his steps,—he arrives, he reaches the<pb n="6-7"
                        xml:id="VAC6167-00000024"/> gateway; he falls, exclaiming "Help! help! for
                     God's sake."</p>
                  <p>On awaking from his swoon, he perceived around him three or four persons, whose
                     appearance was indicative of goodness and compassion. An aged man particularly
                     fixed his attention. This man was endeavoring to warm Valentine's hands.</p>
                  <p>"Unfortunate child," said he, "so young and so destitute! Whence do you come,
                     my little friend?"</p>
                  <p>Valentine told him the name of his village, that his father and mother were
                     dead—and tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"When I found myself alone in the world," added he, "I had no other wish but to
                     die. But our curate exhorted me to be patient, and he told me that Providence
                     would not abandon me. I started then with the hopes of getting something, but
                     shall I have strength to continue my journey?"</p>
                  <p>The old man gazed at him with paternal tenderness, and exclaimed, "Oh, why am I
                     in such a deplorable situation! otherwise I should have been pleased to adopt
                     you, for you appear a good lad; but to-morrow my farm will be sold. To-morrow!
                     after thirty years hard labor, Jacob Kauffmann will be driven from his old
                     homestead! You can have hope, but I have none!"</p>
                  <p>Whilst the farmer spoke, Valentine felt that inward pain which agonized<pb
                        n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6167-00000025"/> him on his way; he uttered a stifled
                     groan, and fainted. Valentine was attacked with small-pox; that dreadful malady
                     was then snatching its victims by thousands; for Jenner, this benefactor, to
                     whom there should be one hundred statues, had not yet made known his admirable
                     discovery of vaccination.</p>
                  <p>How could Valentine recover, cast as he was into the most abject misery, having
                     for nourishment but hard crusts, steeped in water, and lying on an old pallet,
                     with scarcely any covering?.... It was a mystery, and his recovery was probably
                     the work of that Providence whom the orphan never invokes in vain.</p>
                  <p>However, the young traveller was on foot, and he was on the point of his
                     departure, so as to be no further charge to the good Kauffman, when the latter
                     anticipating his resolution, said:</p>
                  <p>"My child, you are now well, thank God. I have been able to care you a little,
                     on account of my creditors allowing me time. Now I must, indeed, quit this
                     farm, and hire myself out to strangers. Do you likewise think of earning your
                     bread? At your age it is dangerous to live by begging; it inclines to habits of
                     indolence."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! that is not my intention, Mr. Kauffman."</p>
                  <p>"'Tis well. Listen, then, to what I am going to say. There is, notfar <pb
                        n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6167-00000026"/> from here, a hermitage, where a few
                     pious men have retired from the world to consecrate themselves to God and
                     prayer. Their only riches is the possession of four or five cows, which afford
                     them milk and cheese. Will you become the guardian of this little herd?"</p>
                  <p>"Willingly."</p>
                  <p>"I have spoken of you to those good fathers, of your gentleness, of your
                     honesty; they are disposed to receive you. When you wish I shall take you
                     thither."</p>
                  <p>"I can accompany you now," said the boy, resolutely. He added, "It will spare
                     you at least one meal."</p>
                  <p>The farmer took his protg to the hermitage, where Valentine again was welcomed.
                     When Jacob Kauffman went on his way home, the child's gaze followed him
                     wistfully. He should ever love this excellent old man who had saved his
                     life.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>From the day that Valentine entered the house of the kind hermits, lie found
                     the peace and happiness of a quiet life. He had bread to eat! It was not indeed
                     the comforts of a home, which you enjoy, dear readers, but it was an easy, an
                     honest occupation in the midst of nature's own quietude. Valentine began the
                     day by prayer, he terminated it in the same manner; he never neglected his
                     religious duties. He who had no father to protect him, no mother to care or
                     caress him, what consolation lie found in the thoughts of God and the blessed
                     Virgin, who is the true patron of innocence!</p>
                  <p>In contemplating the beauties of Creation, he acquired the knowledge of a Being
                     whom he venerated as the author of all things, the Master of life and of
                     destiny. The employment of his time was well regulated. The young herdsman did
                     not restrict himself to the driving of his cows from meadow to meadow; he found
                     no pleasure in stretching himself upon the green sod, as those do who lead that
                     life. Though he scrupulously fulfilled his task, his thoughts were elevated and
                     noble. A great change was operating, as if unawares, on his mind: this change
                     was a thirst for learning.</p>
                  <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6167-00000028"/>
                  <p>How had this simple child divined the invaluable possession of intellectual
                     knowledge? How had the love of study proved to him that the science of the
                     firmament is called Astronomy; that related events of nations were termed
                     History; and that the form of the earth, the positions of countries, towns and
                     rivers, were comprised under the title of Geography?</p>
                  <p>We cannot say; and howsoever it may have been, he had not received those ideas
                     from the lips of the hermits with whom he had been but so short a time. It is
                     to be supposed then, that Valentine had learned by the greatness of his genius,
                     by the intensity of his studies, all that professors have taught for
                     centuries.</p>
                  <p>Admirable example of patience! There is a young man, who imposes upon himself a
                     law of becoming not only a scholar, but a genius!</p>
                  <p>Once having made inroads through the regions of intelligence, he lingers not on
                     the way. In default of instruments, he invents; he constructs his own
                     instruments and geographical maps. He learns something each day; each day he
                     increases his stock of knowledge.</p>

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>ONE afternoon Valentine was sitting at the foot of a tree, with his head bent
                     over a species of map wrought in bark; he was so wrapped up in his own thoughts
                     that he seemed lost to aught else around. Those words, "What are you doing
                     there, my boy?" caused him a sudden start. He instantly looked up, and
                     perceived a man dressed in an elegant hunting suit Not in the least intimidated
                     by: the brilliant appearance of this personage, he quietly answered,</p>
                  <p>"Sir, I am seeking the road to Quebec."</p>
                  <p>"To Quebec!" repeated the stranger, in utter amazement; "do you know what
                     Quebec is?"</p>
                  <p>"Why, sir, do you indeed suppose me so ignorant? Quebec is the principal city
                     of Canada."</p>
                  <p>"Well answered, my boy; you study geography then, during your leisure
                     moments?"</p>
                  <p>"Oh, sir, it is my passion. And astronomy, and history.... But I don't know
                     Latin..... Oh! if I had books!...</p>
                  <p>"You shall have them, my friend, you shall have them!" exclaimed the
                     stranger.</p>
                  <p>Then suddenly fifteen or twenty persons, all richly attired, came forward and
                     exclaimed:</p>
                  <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6167-00000030"/>
                  <p>"Ah, prince, you are here! we were seeking you to finish the hunt; we were
                     growing rather uneasy."</p>
                  <p>"My horse carried me off, and led me astray; but I don't regret this incident,
                     for it has furnished me an opportunity of making a wonderful discovery."</p>
                  <p>"Which? which?" exclaimed all present.</p>
                  <p>"The discovery of this herds'-boy."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" murmured disdainfully some of the young noblemen.</p>
                  <p>"Gentlemen," said the prince, sternly, "suspend your opinion. This boy whom you
                     see will rise far above many who are placed high by rank and fortune. Instead
                     of besotting himself by this life in the open air, by sleeping away the hours
                     of life, while his herds graze he has appreciated the advantages of learning;
                     he has aimed at becoming a scholar; and I confess that his answers have
                     astounded me. Your name, my boy?"</p>
                  <p>"Valentine Duval."</p>
                  <p>"You will become illustrious. That name will yet be known. Come with me. The
                     education which you have so well begun shall be completed."</p>
                  <p>"But I belong to the hermits."</p>
                  <p>"I shall send them one of my officers to apprise them of your departure."</p>
                  <p>"No! no! my lord; I should be ungrateful to leave so abruptly. Allow<pb
                        n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6167-00000031"/> low me to return with my herds, and
                     bid them farewell.</p>
                  <p>"Be it so, Valentine, you are as good as you are learned."</p>
                  <p>The herds' boy whistled for his cows, and disappeared in the direction of the
                     hermitage.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>THREE years of study at the College of M——, completed the studies of Valentine.
                     After this novitiate, coming out as professor, the young man was nominated
                     private librarian and professor of history, by one Leopold, at Luneville.
                     Henceforth his fortune was assured. Here is the use he made of it: in the first
                     place he sought out Kauffman; the poor man was yet living, but so miserably,
                     that he hardly earned what would keep him alive, and that little was obtained
                     by the sweat of his brow.</p>
                  <p>"Do you remember me, Mr. Kauffman?" asked Valentine.</p>
                  <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6167-00000032"/>
                  <p>"No, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I am that orphan whom you saved so generously, when you were depressed
                     yourself, by reverses of fortune."</p>
                  <p>The old man uttered a cry, and tenderly embraced his former protg.</p>
                  <p>"Heaven has blessed me," resumed the young man. "A worthy prince gave me means
                     of instruction, and has placed me near him. But I have not forgotten you. I
                     have come to offer you the means of spending the rest of your days in
                     comfort."</p>
                  <p>A cottage, a little garden, and a pension drawn from the salary of Valentine,
                     were the return of Kauffman's charity.</p>
                  <p>As to the good hermits, their exdrover boy had not lost sight of them. At his
                     desire and at his expense, their pious retreat, which the inclemencies of the
                     weather had in a decree impaired, was restored and built up.</p>
                  <p>Valentine's fame became so great that the emperor Francis called him to Vienna
                     to establish a cabinet of medals. There, in the midst of the great and the
                     learned, Valentine lived many long years; the goodness of his heart remained
                     unchanged, pride was unknown to his mind, and ambition had no place in his
                     soul.</p>
                  <p>An admirable model for those who propose seeking and acquiring knowledge, a
                     bright example for those who possess it.</p>
