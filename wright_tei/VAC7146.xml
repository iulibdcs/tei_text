TO THE DAUGHTERS OF THE ORDER OF SAINT URSULA, INGUISHED ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR PIETY, "EARNING AND,VIRTUE, AND FOR THEIR DEVOTION TO THE SACRED CAUSE OF CHRISTIAN EDUCATION, WHCH STRENGTHENS AND BEAUTIFIES EVERY STATE OF SOCIETY, AND IMPARTS TO IT THE FITFUL CHARMS OF INNOCENCE, LOVE, RELIGION AND TRUTH, THS VOLUME IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7146-00000004"/> PREFACE. To put on record the committal of a deed of shame, and horror, in order that its exposure may in the future deter men from the perform- ance of such crimes, is the aim of the present work. It cannot be doubted that our social prog- ress is such as to make persecutions for conscience' sake matters of rare occurrence. Church wreckings, convent burnings, and such- like barbarisms, however, would indicate the transference of religious animosity from the person to the temple. If our bodies are safe from the murderous hand of the ruffian bigots, places dedicated to the worship of God, and others used as retreats by those who have ded- icated themselves to the service of heaven, are oftentimes despoiled for the gratification of a wild fanaticism, generated by the insidious teachings and preachings of ignorant men who call themselves ministers of the Gospel. Con- vent wreckings at Philadelphia, Charlestown and attempted wreckings in the north of Ire- land, are of too recent a date to make us sup- 6&#xD;<pb n="vi-7 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7146-00000005"/> 'VI       PREFACE. pose that such evil practices have passed away from our midst for ever. Such is doubtless the earnest hope and desire of every honest person, but, unfortunately, the outrageous out- bursts of popular passion, which are witnessed from time to time in various parts of the world, forbid the belief that such dangers as are de- decribed in this book shall never occur again. The permanent exposure of evil practices generally leads to their cure, or, at least, cre- ates such horror of them in the public mind as to render them almost powerless. With this belief the present work was written, and, al- though sufficient historical data concerning the destruction of the Convent of Mount Benedict existed, it appeared to the Author and Pub- lisher, that the formation of such data into the attractive form of a Story was useful and desirable. The Story is, therefore, historically correct, while, at the same time, the surround- ing incidents of interest will be found to con- tain pictures of religion and virtue which should prove acceptable to all. These are so interwoven with the general facts of the burn- ing of Mount Benedict Convent, as to form what the Author hopes will prove a readable volume for old and young.       P. McC.

"Oh bother! Can't you give a reason for such a ques- tion; asked, too, with such a solemn looking face?" (1)  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7146-00000008"/> a reason' why, certainly; but tell me is this the-" "Fifteenth day of August, to be sure." 'Thefifteenth day of August. Ah, you're-quite- right." "Cecilia, what can you mean by drawling forth, 'Ah,  : you're quite right?'"  "Kate, did you not hear it?" "I Hear what?" Those strangely beautiful and somewhat mystic sounds." "Yes, indeed, dear Cecilia. Even now I hear them; strains such as angels might sing. But really, Cecilia, I cannot-I know you'll excuse me-see any connection between your sudden start, your exclamation, and then your query,' What day of the month is this?' " "Don't you remember, Kate, one day when your heart was lone and sad, and when I endeavored to cheer you, how your mind suddenly reverted to the happy days spent in your Ireland?" , ', Not once but many times, dear Cecilia," said the speaker, tenderly embracing her companion, -have I troubled you by reciting tales of sorrow now past and gone." "But do you not remember on one particular occa- sion describing to me the misery you endured at the hands of--" "Nay, Cecilia, say no more--on that subject at least." Pardon me. I was only going to allude to your description of the high festival in your Church on the Fifteenth day of August." "Ah I good, dear girl. I had quite forgotten that. I was thinking of other things just now." "Then you comprehend me?" "I do, indeed, Cecilia. Yes; listen again. That mu- dc seems divine." "How happy they must be who join in that song whatever it may be."                   l   ALAL  T AVIAJl A i V-P 1UALD   U "Wouldn't you like to be present and see as well as to hear, Cecilia?" "Oh! with all my heart. Is it possible, do you think, to be admitted?" "Let us try."                '   Kate and Cecilia did try. Kate, with the slightest shade of persistence in her character, appeared ex- tremely anxious to gain admittance for herself and com- panion. After a few minutes both were quietly allowed to enter the chapel of the Ursuline Convent of Mount Benedict, in the vicinity of Boston, Massachusetts. Both girls, Cecilia in particular, stood entranced at the entrance. Few were present save those belonging to the establishment, and these were composed of the Daughters of Saint Ursula and a few of their pupils; some of the latter being present as a duty, and others by permission. It was Vesper time, and a holy calm was over the place. Not a sound, but the sweet harmony of voices in praise of God and in honor of her whose festival it was, could be heard. The altar was prepared for Benediction. Instinctively Cecilia bent her knee and bowed her head. Her heart, if not her soul, was overpowered by the lovely scene so suddenly presented to her admiring gaze. Kate was at her side, and she too bowed head, heart and soul before the presence of the Most High. There was the altar, overspread with lights and flowers. A mist of incense hung around it. Cecilia saw only dimly. Kate saw with different eyes-with those-f faith. To the one it appeared as a sweet scenf of peaceful enchantment; to the other, as the vestibule of a beautiful tansion, the interior of which was con-  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7146-00000009"/> 4       MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, sealed by waxen tapers and odorous flowers from the gaze of the multitude. Cecilia saw things of earth, beautifully arranged to , captivate and elevate the senses; Kate saw behind those things, and beheld that which Cecilia could not behold! Then again arose those enchanting strains. It seemed as if the seraphim of Heaven had descended and lent their aid to the earthly voices of those below. Cecilia was visibly affected. Kate observed it, and, somehow, her thoughts rose quick to God and His blessed Mother-whether in behalf of herself or Cecilia, or both, she could scarcely say, The O Salutaris and Tantum Ergo followed, and Cecilia Morton felt as if her very soul was ravished with super- natural delight. The sweet tinkle of a little silver bell was the signal for bowed heads, and as Cecilia desired-not through a careless display of vanity, however-to witness every thing-that she could, she felt the blood rush to her face as if she had been guilty of some crime, for not joining with those around her in lowly adoration. But she could not. She had a sort of undefined repugnance in falling down to worship that which she knew she was ignorant of. At this juncture, her eyes rested on the prostrate form of Kate, who appeared dead to all else save that Pres- ence before which she knelt so devoutly. Cecilia envied Kate; but, after all, her envy was not of the usual worldly type. It was envy of that sort which Cecilia looked upon, or tried to look upon, as a virtue, the possession of which she would not have parted with just then, had she been its owner, for any ' worldly consideration. Kate slowly lifted her head; Cecilia was all watch- fulness. Her keen gray eye detected a sparkling tear- drop, which had just freshy fallen on Kate's cheek.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.        6 Cecilia wondered to see it. Was Kate ill, or in trouble? If not, why were her eyes suffused with moisture? A fact which appeared very strange to Cecilia. Kate was absorbedlin devotion. Cecilia was absorbed in Kate, and neither were aware that the beautiful little altar was just then being Stripped of its outward appearance. The Regina Coeli was being chanted, and Cecilia di- rected her eyes from Kate, to the altar half disrobed. The sounds of that glorious anthem filled her soul with a newer and stranger delight. Perhaps it was that the beautiful ceremonies just then being finished had pro- duced a greater effect on her mind than the subdued appearance of Kate. Cecilia felt quite strange like. She had never felt so before in all her young lifetime. For a few moments she fancied she was ill; then she banished that thought, and wondered why it came into her mind. Still the divine strains of the music entered her heart, and produced therein a peace which Cecilia had never experienced before. Somehow she felt troubled, and yet at peace. It was a strange sensation for Cecilia to experience, and that probably would account ;for the manner in which she afterward alluded to-her visit with Kate to, Mount Benedict. I She felt tortured. 1 I love this place," she said-- I no, I hate it bitterly I " was the inward ejaculation of poor Cecilia. The words Begina Coeli still seemed to float in the air. O, how sweetly they sounded on Cecilia's ears, and yet Cecilia began to wish that she did not like to hear the strain. '* Come, Kate, will you depart?" she said, in quite a whisper; and as she said so, she touched her compan- ion slightly on the shoulder. Kate arose, still keeping her head slightly bent downward. Both passed near to the altar, where a veil-like drap- ery of incense yet remained. Kate bent her knee for the last time, while Cecilia  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7146-00000010"/> 6      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, gave a sigh of relief as she once again breathed the outer air. During her visit, especially at Benediction, she got frightened in some way lest her soul might yied to the influences around her. "Kate observed something like this feeling in Cecilia, owing to the uneasy manner of her companion, and adroitly changed the current of her thoughts by direct- ing Cecilia's attention to the varied and golden beauties of the setting sun. The theme suited Cecilia's mind, which instantly be- trayed itself in the delighted expression of her face. "That is heaven's evening panorama exhibited for the delight of the world before the sun sinks into the sea," said Cecilia; " don't you love it, dear Kate?," she asked, as she pressed her companion's arm. "Most ardentlyI " was Kate's reply. "Now, if we had the accompaniment of the convent singing, don't you believe that we could worship God out here much better than in the confines of a small chapel, no matter how beautiful?" "God can be worshipped at all times, and in all places, and truly, too, according to the disposition of our hearts; But our worship is never so acceptable to Him-in fact how can it be so?-as when given in the place wherein He Himself especially abides, and to which place He so lovinglyy invites us."- "But are not the changuing glories of -that setting sun the work of His hands and where can we better worship God than in view of such things?" "To worship Him in His REAL PRESENCE is betters" quietly remarked Kate, " for, thereby we worship Him in all things, He Himself containing everything." "I have often heard you say so, or, something simi- lar," was Cecilia's reply; "but Kate, I never can un- derstand what you exactly mean, I know the fault is mine. and-" "Rather does the fault rest with me," insisted Kate.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       7 "But, perhaps after all, it is too soon to expect that your mind can comprehend those things to which I have repeatedly alluded. Our comprehension of such things does not come when we choose. An earnest disposition to understand and appreciate them is necessary-before the action of God's grace in enlightening the soul." "That will do, Kate-that will do. ^ Whenever you talk seriously on such matters, I always begin to find myself yield to you, and I don't like to yield to you, good and all as you. are, sweet girl," said Cecilia, with truthful animation beaming in her face." i' Never yield to me," was Kate's quiet reply; " but, remember, Cecilia, never reject the first impressions of God's teaching to your soul." "Will Hee make me sure that it is His teaching?" in- nocently asked Cecilia. "Why, certainly." "And not your teaching, Kate?" "Well; in His wisdom, He often uses an humble hu- man means to effect a good purpose." "Couldn't He do it without that means?" 'C I rather thinly He could." "Then, why not. Why not let Him--" "( Cecilia!" "Pardon met dear Kate, I at once see the improprie- ty of my remark." There was perfect silence observed between Kate and Cecilia during the remainder of their walk. Cecilia imagined she had fallen below zero in the es- timation of her companion, while Kate felt as happy as a little queen. As these two young ladies are destined to act a prom- inent part in this story, it is necessary that we should learn something more about them, and for that purpose they are entitled to the benefit of an opening chapter.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7146-00000011"/> 8      ' MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,             ii CHAPTER I. CECILIA MORTON AND KATE CROLLY. " O God of justice I God of love I Rain down Thy mercies from above, And make our sinful souls to be Worthy to dwell for aye with Thee I  CECILIA MORTON was an orphan, a double orphan: had neither father nor mother, and never remembered having seen either parent, both having died while she was yet in her infancy. At the opening of our story, Cecilia Morton was scarcely sixteen years old, and yet there was something more than maiden ripeness in her well developed form. Cecilia possessed a voice of exquisite sweetness, and was rather proud of her musical performances. She had been flattered so repeatedly by those who heard her play and sing, that it was not'to be wondered at that vanity had entered somewhat deeply into her character. Of this she was not half so well aware as others; or, it may be that she was well aware of it, but, like most others, did not wish to appear so; for self-love usually weaves a bandage over our mental vision, in order to conceal from ourselves its own misdeeds. Cecilia had some such thoughts as these, but then there was the ever-vigilant monitor to direct her if she would but hearken to his still small voice. It is un- pleasant, however, to be disabused of our belief in our own merits, whatever they may be, and we often inwardly plead that if our eyes be bandaged it is impos- sible for us to see. ", -   THE VIOLATED TOMB.              9 Don't you think I sing delightfully, Kate?" asked Cecilia, addressing her companion. "Yes, dear girl, you do sing charmingly," replied Kate, with a'coldness of air that chilled the imagination of the delighful singer. "' What every one says is true,' is a common proverb, you know, Kate; and those who have ever heard me, say they never heard my equal." "What every one says is not true, and never was true," said Kate, with more than usual emphasis. The speaker was here taking exception to the absurd proverb or quotation made by Cecilia, and yet the latter was so taken with the beautiful imagery she had con- jured up, regarding herself, that she felt as if Kate pointedly denied her the possession of those powers and qualities which her companion had formerly granted her. Cecilia's face colored a deep crimson, a fact which rather pleased Kate than otherwise. " But you are somebody, dear Kate." " But not everybody, dear Cecilia." "Every one who ever heard me sing speaks as raptur- ously as yourself concerning my performance," said Cecilia, with a tremor in her rich, mellow voice. " I have indeed spoken rapturously, as you say, Ceci- lia; but did it never occur to you that I looked upon you only as happy in the possession of a great gift, and re- ferred to that circumstance much more than to any special merit of your own ?" "That explains many things to me," said Cecilia, "concerning your words of praise. You never looked like others in speaking to me: your words were as kind- ly spoken, your looks as full, even fuller of your own soul, and yet I did not feel half so elated at your utter- ances as I did at those spoken by others infinitely be- neath you." " Beneath me " exclaimed Kate.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7146-00000012"/> 10 OUNT BENEDICT; ORR, "Yes; beneath you, certainly," replied Cecilia, warmly. "Cecilia!" "I am listening, Kate;." "I endeavored only a few minutes ago to laugh you out of the belief of the absurdity of that popular fallacy that what every one says must be true, and here I must take you to task again and inform you that there is no person, no matter how humble, beneath me." Cecilia was astonished, nay, literally stunned an(: taken aback. No person beneath the beautiful, the viva- cious, and the witty Kate Crolly, She whom Cecilia in the hidden recesses of her soul envied as the possessor of certain unseen charms and qualities, the existence of which could be known only to those who were on terms of the closest intimacy with Kate; she to whom Cecilia, had often looked to for signs and words of comfort when suffering from the stings and remarks of others. This was strange, indeed, to Cecilia. "Is not Biddy the old apple-woman down there on Medford road beneath our charming Kate, and in a thousand different ways?" asked Cecilia, with one of her pleasantest smiles. "No; God forbid I should either think or say so," re- plied Kate, warmly, and the light of the girl's pure soul shone brilliantly in her dark blue eyes as she spoke. ;' Oh, I see," nodded Cecilia, with a slight bantering air, ' what everybody says must be true,' and forthwith Kate Crolly takes exception. No one is infinitely be- neath you, and Kate. Crolly rises like a warrior in arms. Now, what if Kate Crolly, in her very anxiety to appear the teacher of others, and in the excess of her humility only sought that praise which she inwardly courts but outwardly despises, should turn out not a vain but a proud little girl, concealing her pride and taking a pri- vate satisfaction in the false belief that she has success- fully imposed upon her friends?"

Cecilia was discomfited and Kate saw it. "Listen now," said Kate, seriously: jthat Cecilia Morton is a good girl Iknow; that she is possessed of rare musical talents, Cecilia Morton and Kate Crolly both know. That Kate thanks heaven for Cecilia's splendid attainments, God knows. That everybody knows everything concerning Cecilia is not true; and if it wpre true that everybody who has the happiness of knowing her speaks the truth in her regard is not true, therefore, my pet Cecilia reasons badly in her own case, and is likely to reason badly in the case of others." "In whose else do you mean?" asked Cecilia, rather imperiously. "In- mine,"' replied Kate, in an irritatingly placid tone. I ' I can scarcely understand," said Cecilia with a slight backward jerk of her head, not unnoticed by her only auditor. "Infinitely beneath-don't you recollect?" and Kate looked up with a smile of innocent meaning into Cecilia's eyes. "When shall I understand you, Kate? do you under- stand yourself? does any other understand you, or?-"i 5 "' A moment, Cecilia, just one moment," interrupted Kate. "There is no one beneath me nor you; we may possess qualities different from others, as theirs differ from ours, and these may be good or bad accordingly as we ourselves make them so.

"' I promise," said Cecilia, rather mournfully, for she dreaded Kate's seriousness. "Well, then," said Kate-"I am only supposing, remember," and she held up her finger by way of warning. "Some people foolishy imagine that the majority of their acquaintances are very inferior to themselves. They never ask themselves in what re- spect. They never imagine that what they believe to be their own superiority is but the exercise of some quality given them by their Creator. That quality may be, and often is, acceptable to the world; say the possession of a rich and very beautiful voice, such as yours, dear Cecilia; a quick eye and a quick hand, guided by a well-trained mind, so as to call forth enchanting strains of music from a dead, dull instrument, which appears to spring into life when you touch it. Now, had these gifts--none of which really belong to us-been bestowed by the same kind hand which placed you in their posses- sion, say, on the apple-woman, for instance, would she not have been just as likely as you to have charmed all her hearers, and might she not, at the same time, have been deaf to all the spurious praise so often bestowed upon us by the multitude?" Cecilia was on the verge of ano'ther interruption, but, remembering her promise, instantly checked herself. Kate observed this but did not appear as if she had noticed it. "No one praises the poor apple-woman," continued Kate, no matter how fine the fruit she sells may be. She seldom procures a generous, pleasant customer. She is told that she sells too dear; her apples are sour, unripe, small in size, old, or whatever else you like.

"Then there is the common dustman, generally of old age, and trying his very best to exert himself as if the strength of youth remained to him. We turn up our nose in passing him by, his appearance and surround- ings are repugnant to our delicate senses, and we wouldn't for the world come into contact with such a creature. What is he? He is only a scavenger who removes offal and dust, and filth of all kinds from our presence. Now these and all such like are creatures of God fulfilling the duties of their station in this life, and if we but compare them faithfully with ourselves the balance will be found on their side."  Have you done?" demanded Cecilia, observing her companion to pause. "Yes, if you desire it," said Kate, with imperturbable gravity. "4 Well, thank our'stars, we are neither old apple-wo- men, nor dustmen, nor none of that class," said Cecilia, more haughtily than was her wont. "Let us thank our stars that we know out position in life, and whether outwardly or inwardly, the latter al- ways preferred, that we exercise that beautiful humil- ity which draws us closer to all who know us and makes them better for our presence."

"AN many thanks to you, my young lady, an' may your face be always as purty as it is this minute, an' may a shadow of this world's care never cross it so as to lave a mark behind;" were the words which fell on the ears of Kate and Cecilia as they approached from an opposite direction unobserved by the speaker. i Have you any sweet oranges, ma'am?" inquired Cecilia, coming forward. "C Lot's of oranges, Miss, but as to their sweetness, not having tried them your humble sarvint cannot say," quietly returned Biddy, with a stiff attempt at a curtsy. Kate smiled at the scrupulous exactness of Biddy's answer, wondering in her own mind if merchants in a higher sphere of life were so precise and honest in their dealings. "You'll have some sweet apples, I suppose?' again inquired Cecilia, who busied herself in examining Bid- dy's stock in trade. 'C Lots on 'em, Miss. I dined on two or three of them myself, an' as -they're all of the same stookl-lady fin- gers we call 'emni-I can vouch,for them," saying which she pointed out several fine specimens to Cecilia who opened her basket to receive them.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7146-00000015"/> 16      MOUNT BENEDICT; ORB, The sale was to Biddy a large one, and she showed her appreciation of Cecilia in the following terms: "My lady has a beautiful voice, I know by the way she speaks, an' if she just eats one of them beauties an' takes a tumbler full of beautiful cold spring water at five or six o'clock in the morning, she'll have, oh, such a delightful voice all the day long.  Kate burst out laughing. She could not restrain her-  self. She knew that Cecilia was anything but an early riser, and she observed the color come and go upon her  cheek, as the old apple-woman had so distinctly speci- fied the exact time for partaking of the cold water and apple. "That's just the very resate as I give to that beauti- ful young lady goin' through the gate yonder," and Biddy pointed to the fair young creature who had earned  the lavish praise spoken in her regard, as Cecilia and Kate approached to where they stood.  "You know her, then?" asked Kate, observing that the young lady had entered the convent grounds of      i Mount Benedict.  'Know her, Alanna? why, bless you, every one knows little Sister Marguerite." Is she a Sister, then?" inquired Cecilia. "Oh, dear, no. But never mind, she says she will be one, some day.

"Have you many customers from that place?" naive- ly inquired Kate, who appeared to be rather inquisitive for once. "t No, dear bless you, scarce a one. That dear child you saw enter is only a scholar; she is returning, to- day, from home over yonder. They gets one day in the month, you know, ma'am--; an' you may be sure the apples she bought are for some little friends in the school."  "But does she not use your own recipe?" inquired Cecilia, remembering the taunt unknowingly spoken by Biddy. "My own what, dear," inquired Biddy, with her ear turned toward the speaker, as if her want of under- standing arose more from deafness than anything else. "Your' resate ' about eating fine apples and drinking cold water early in the morning, in order to improve her voice," said Kate, rapidly. Biddy laughed outright at this reminder, and looked at her visitors alternately, to see if they were seriously or otherwise inclined. "It's only by giving a resate," she said, " that you can get little Sister Marguerite to listen for a moment about her beautiful singin'. She don't understand you at first, an' then through modesty she listens; but who would ever think of advisin' the takin' of an apple to improve the voice.

"Ah I but dear bless you, if you only heard them tip there," she said, pointing to the Convent, 4" as I myself, with my own ears, heard them a few evenings ago, you would just think that it wasn't themselves, but the choirs above, that had come down unknownst and jined them." "I had the great happiness of hearing the nuns' choir," said Cecilia, thoughtfully, " and I think it was the finest music I ever heard." "There now, sure I knew you were a good singer yourself. None but a lady could say that so beauti- fully," said Biddy, quite proudly. "And I, too, heard that divine music to which you refer," added Kate. "Then, praises be to God, you're both good Catholics." "Not both," answered Kate, just a little annoyed at Biddy's outspoken manner. "You are one, for certain," said Biddy, firmly. "I am, but this lady-" "Sure, it's a thousand pardons I ask of the lady an' yourself, I never intended anything but just to ask you --" and Biddy stammered with confusion, as she beheld the color heighten on Kate's cheek.

When they had beaten each other to their own satisfaction they got lown on the ground, and with their coarse sleeves wiped bhe blood and froth from their faces. Keeley then pro-.j  )osed that as Buzzard didn't beat Craze, and as Craze lidn't beat Buzzard, all three should pay a visit to Har-i? ry Buck's house, where they might get something to re- store their breath. The proposal was no sooner made than adopted. In the course of a very short time a perfect reconeila- ion had taken place, and then followed explanations. "Jack," said Rat Keeley, "you knew the import-. ance of the work we had on hand, and as a good deal lepended on it, both Harry and myself felt annoyed and disappointed at your absence. Now, the question is, lave we not lost our chance to-night?" Buzzard replied that he thought they had not. "Why shouldn't our chances be as good to-night as last night?" asked Craze. "Because there's more likelihood of the Boss being    , at home," answered Keeley. "But I know he will not return," insisted Jack Buzzard; t" so, now, let's call in the landlord, and make known to him some of our plans. He's a good fellow, mnd I'll warrant Mr. Buck will prove himself a man." Keeley and Craze both dissented from the proposal of  Buzzard. They insisted that Buck should know noth- ing of their plans, while Mr. Buzzard was equally re- solved that his proposal should be carried out. Here were three villains who thought they knew each other, and not even one kr iw the other, although each be- lieved he knew all about the other two. One of the chief reasons why Buzzard felt so annoyed at Harry   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       23 Craze was, that he, the said Buzzard, felt afraid that some little private arrangements of his own with Mr. Henry Buck might have become known to his compan- ions, Harry Craze and Rat Keeley. That Buzzard was a coward, and was made so by whatever remnant of conscience that individual possessed, was manifest from the fears entertained by him lest Mr. Henry Buck should not be admitted to the order of fraternity (fight- ing included) which prevailed between himself, Keeley and Craze. He fancied he saw something in the faces of his companions which led him to suppose that his designs were known. "You're clever, Buzzard,", drawled forth Craze. "Yes; he's clever," sneered Keeley. "I are," retorted Buzzard, with a sinister look which conveyed the intent of his evil mind, but in a different manner from that understood by his companions. "And for his cleverness let him call in the Boss," said Craze, desirous no doubt of conciliating his com- panion, whose ill-will he had earned so lately. Buzzard felt mightily pleased. "What say you, Keeley?" he asked, addressing that individual. "I can't say as I knows much about him," answered Keeley in a tone not half so assuring to Buzzard as that of Harry Craze.                      . "He's a good fellow," said Buzzard, rather loudly, in hopes that the person spoken of might hear the opinion just then related of him. Mr. Buck did distinctly hear the expression " (rood fel- low," and his estimate of that flattering term may be judged from the exclamation he made when he heard it: "D- D n the scoundrel, but he's kind, very," ejacu- lated Mr. Henry Buck. "He's trurer nor steel and flint joined," insisted Mr. Buzzard.  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7146-00000021"/> "There's some steel and some flint not true even when joined," muttered lat Keeley. "Wise one,' sneered HarlTy Buck, who, with his ear placed to a holp in the partition, and made by himself for listening purposes, heard every word that passed, just as if he were sitting in the middle of the trio then engaged in determining the value of the character of the man whom Buzzard was endeavoring to introduce to his companions. 'I I hain't no perticklar objection to any friend of yours being admitted to our drilling," said Rat Keeley; "but you know, Buzzard, or you should know, whichl ain't better, but worse, that us three were to go on this business by ourselves. I'm now short twenty dollars for them implementa. You and Craze are only half." ' Well, why that's the very thing, the very reason," said Buzzard, slapping his thigh with his enormous paw.  Why, as I wanted another to go halves, and to pay you back your ten dollar piece." "I ain't wanting back anything as I gave for the benefit of us all; but it was understood that three only should divide them profits," said Rat Keeley, rather des- pondingly. "Suppose we take on Buck as an apprentice?" sug- gested Harry Craze. 4 Yes, let us suppose him a 'prentice," added Buz- zard, quite tickled with the idea of initiating a man into a certain course of villainy, who was, probably, as big a villain as any of those who were thus debating about his admission into their company. Craze and Buzzard were unanimous that Buck should be one of their number, while Rat Keeley obstinately in- sisted that the original partnership should remain as at first formed. "Can you give reason-good, solid reason-for your objection?" inquired Buzzard, in an humble tone of   THE VIOLATED TOMB.   25   voice, which proved that the speaker had a memory good enough to remember the occurrence of a few minutes before. "I ain't good at reasons; but I tell you I don't like the likes of Harry Buck, and never did, and never will," replied Keeley, pretty emphatically. Harry Buck heard every syllable of whatever was said in his regard, and the appearance of his face, as he listened to the opposition of Keeley to his admission among the '44 crowd " of worthies then in his house, was- terrible to look upon. Usually Harry Buck had a very sinister expression of face; but there were times when he could make it ap- pear for a moment or two as if lie were the most inno- cent man living, or, as if he were afflicted with some private sorrow, heroically borne and concealed from the knowledge of those around him. As he listened in pri- vate to the conversation about himself, his face had a de- moniacal expression. Jack Buzzard was glad of the op- position given to Craze and himself by Keeley. He felt, Iudginghy his own evil nature, that 44 friend Buck," as he used often to style him, was listening to every word that passed at that 44 meeting," and being desirous of standing high in the estimation of his 4" friend," Jack Buzzard was glad of the opportunity then afforded him of saying something in favor of one whose good opinion he courted. "Let us finish up," cried out Keeley, somewhat impa- tiently .. "Yes; let's finish up, and at once," added Buzzard. "Harry Buck, or no Buck Harry," vociferated Craze, with a horse laugh at what he considered a witty thing.

Two young men named Crolly were left in charge of an only sister. They occupied their father's farm at a place called Saul, near to Downpatrick, Ireland. Tbese young men were aged respectively twenty-four years  and thirty years, at the time of their father's death. The younger was named Owen, and the elder Patrick. Their mother had died many years before it pleased Heaven that their good father should follow her, and one year after the death of the latter, Owen Crolly married a poor but exceedingly handsome Irish girl, called Mary McShane. After the marriage, Owen had a conversation with his brother Patrick, and proposed that he and his wife should emigrate to America. Patrick Crolly listened to all the schemes put forth by Owen, and judged that his brother had suddenly taken the idea of emigrating into his head lest that the mar- riage, which was rather a sudden one, had caused some pain between them. Patrick Crolly looked upon himself as the natural  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7146-00000023"/> 8 ,fMOUNT BENEDICT; OR,  aretaker and guardian of his brother and sister, the  atter a girl only fifteen years old. He entertained a  rery strong affection for his sister and brother, and was nuch grieved that any feeling should exist to cause a  separation.  Owen Crolly was very decided in his expressed de-  :ermination to make America his future home, while his   i )rother wished to know if such determination arose [rom a desire to succeed in the Wforld, or through fear  that his marriage would cause a difference in their family relations. Owen Crolly was the very essence of truth and honor. Ee could dissemble a little at times, in matters of no  serious moment, but when he did so, the tell-tale smile that enwreathed his handsome mouth made it evident that Owen Crolly had just spoken from the lips and not from the heart. It was great praise to say that Owen was as honest as  his brother, and that saying had passed into a sort of  proverb among the neighbors. In speaking of any one whom they desired to rate as high as possible, it was common for the people to say: "Why, he's as honest as Owen Crolly, and he's as honest as his brother." This used to please Owen well, for he dearly loved his brother; and it pleased Patrick, too, for the latter had industriously implanted in the mind of his brother the  lessons he used to receive from father and mother  Such being the case, Owen hardly knew how to spealt to his brother about the scheme of emigrating. Hle did  not sincerely desire to leave home, but he believed that the change which his marriage had effected required a separation. His brother Patrick had far different thoughts, and wished to test his brother's heart to the core. Patrick felt ill and uneasy since his brother's mar-   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       29 riage, and Owen saw this; hence his determination to emigrate. But Owen did not surmise correctly, although Patrick thought he did. ' Can't we all live together, and comfortably, too,". said Patrick, addressing his brother. "Kate is but a child yet, and Mary is so fond of her," he added, " that I cannot see why we should not all be together, and help one another.' That's quite true, brother," replied Owen; "' but you are the head -here, and suppose you followed my example; whereas I should have followed yours, there is no telling how matters would turn out afterwards." Patrick Crolly laughed heartily at the wisdom dis- played by his brother, and assured him that there wag not the slightest danger of two sisters-in-law occupying their house at the same time. "As to my being the 'head of the house,' Owen," said Patrick, "I wish to make you the head and pos- sessor, as long as Lady Seaforde, our landlady, permits you to remain." This, to Owen, was a turn of affairs which he had not contemplated. That was not to be wondered at, when all things else were known. Patrick Crolly had long looked with favoring eyes on the charms and virtues of Mary McShane. He loved the girl with his whole heart's devotion, and only waited a favorable opportunity of presenting himself before her as a suitor for her heart and hand. When his affection had ripened, he beheld, to his dismay, that she and his brother were on such terms of intimacy as forbade his attempt to approach her in the way he had designed to himself. This was a hard and bitter trial, but Patrick Crolly was master of hihself. He battled against his natural dispositions most heroically, and endeavored to console himself with the knowledge thathis brother had  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7146-00000024"/> MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, been happily blessed in the possession of one whose true goodness of heart had first recommended itself to him. ' I don't understand you," said Owen. "Well, the easiest way to understand me is to fancy that we have changed positions. You become the ; head of the house,' as all married men should be," said Patrick with a hearty laugh, " and I being the free foot, will take your place in your contemplated trip to Amer- ica." "And leave me here with Kate, and my wife, and the farm, and allow you to seek a new home far away from us?" said Owen, with true feeling. "Not exactly so," interposed Patrick. "I mean to have Kate accompany me, and who knows but that be- fore we die we will all meet again, and spend the last years of our lives happily together." To say that Owen Crolly was amazed at this speech of his brother would but poorly express his feelings just then. Owen did not particularly desire to leave home for America. His wife's relations, when they first learned his intention, put themselves steadily against all idea of Mary McShane leaving them. This changed Owen's mind very considerably, but at the same time he saw no opening whereby he might escape the diffi- culty, until the late conversation with his brother Pat- rick gave him some grounds for hope. When Owen Crolly learned that his brother Patrick really desired to sail for America, Owen *as far from being displeased. He loved his brother well, and doated on his young sister Kate; but then he was a married man, only lately married, and that, too, to a handsome Irish girl, and it was not to be wondered alf he desired to please his wife and her relatives at the same time, seeing that the proposition of his brother Patrick ena- bled him to do so without any particular violence to his feelings.    THE VIOLATED TOMB.       ,3 After this matter had been long talked over and duly considered, it was arranged that Owen should advance his brother and sister as much money as would decently and comfortably take them out to America. By the readily proffered aid of his wife's friends, Owen speedily accomplished his part of the transaction, and one month sabsequently saw Kate and Patrick Crolly bidding farewell to Owen and his wife Mary. In due course of time Patrick Crolly, with his youngr charge, landed safely in America. This worthy pair were scarce a fortnight in the land of their adoption, when by force of circumstances they were separated for many years. Kate Crolly got employment in the house of Alvah Morton, of Boston, a gentleman of considerable means, uncle and guardian to Cecilia Morton, and in: whose behalf he held a fortune of no inconsiderable value. Kate Crolly was possessed of many excellent traits of character. She had received, thanks to her brothers, a good education. This she had so improved upon that she ventured, when seeking for a, situation, to say to Mr. Morton that she considered herself qualiied to undertake the duties of companion to Cecilia. This was venturing pretty far, especially when it is known that Cecilia Morton had received a superior ed- ucation to Kate Crolly; that is, superior in one or two respects, especially as regarded school attainments, which, after all, do not form a correct standard when we speak of the superiority of that much misunderstood term, education.  Alvah Morton was on the verge of conveying to Miss Crolly the unpleasant tidings that he did not consider her old enough to become a companion to his niece. He informed Cecilia of his intention, and, proud girl that she was at the time, told her guardian that she thotught it only due to her that she should first see the young lady herself.   &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7146-00000025"/> 32      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "I asked her, and she-at once acknowledged that she was-" "What, dear uncle?" exclaimed Cecilia. "An Irish girl!" "But what of that?" inquired Cecilia, with a good- humored smile.                      i "And worse, I tell you," insisted Alvah Morton. "Worse!" reiterated Cecilia, "Being Irish cannot  be a great fault, dear uncle, seeing that you yourself-"  "Hush! Cecilia, she's a Papist, and had the hardi- hood to acknowledge it!" "Sweet, dear thing," cried out Cecilia, " let me see  i her," and this wayward niece of Mr. Morton's ran into the parlor where Kate Crolly had been in waiting.    i The moment these young girls met; on the very  instant they exchanged looks, their souls, seemed to come into contact as it were, and a mutual love sprang up between them. Cecilia, without the slightest formality, shook hands with Kate Crolly, welcomed her " home," promised a    i whole lot of good things, and in half an hour had pre- vailed on Kate to divest herself of her outer garments, and remain that evening with her. A short time sufficed to see Kate Crolly duly installed  in her new home. It would have been a very hard home  for Kate but for the one chief reason, that she and Ce- cilia were nearly constantly together, and thus escaped a good deal of the torment which had been studiously prepared for Kate, in order to disgust her with her place, and force her retirement. It may seem strange, that in the house of a Boston gentleman such a state of things could be permitted to  exist, but such, nevertheless, was the case; and if Al- vah Morton was not privy to schemes of persecution in-; stituted against a young Irish girl situated like Kate  Crolly, it was not so much on account of any special bars e e. m a.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       33 goodness of heart which he possessed, but rather that he dreaded some act on the part of his high-minded niece which would probably deprive him of the guar- dianship he desired to exercise over her. Mrs. Morton, the lady of the house, was American born. She had been brought up in a very straight- waisted kind of way herself, and spared no effort to have her household modelled on the principles so stu- (diously observed by her neighbors. She was the mother of a very fine family, consisting of three sons, two of whom were settled in life, one as the minister of a Meth- odist congregation, by the members of which the IRev. Alvah Morton, Jun., was " highly accepted; " the other was Dr. Morton, a young and accomplished physician, newly married, and whose practice had fallen off con- siderably in consequence. The third son-well; more of him hereafter.  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7146-00000026"/> CHAPTER V.' CECITTA MORTONrS AUNT DISPLAYS A TEMPER, AND SO  DOES CECILIA-KATE CROLLY'S SUFFERINGS.  "Oh I scorn not then the pious poor, Nor the rosary they tell; Ere Faust was born, or men grew proud  . To read by the light of hell,          .

Kate Crolly had her back turned to the lady at the time she was thus suddenly addressed, and not expect-  ing to be interrupted in the performance of the work in which she was engaged, she turned suddenly round, and nearly fainted as lMrs. Morton dashed toward her  : in a rage, and plucked -a Rosary from her trembling  hand.  "This, I presume," said Mrs. Morton, holding up a  little string of coral beads, with a silver Crucifix attached,  "is one of the causes why our niece has been so neg- lectful lately of exhibiting her delightful powers as a vocalist in the church of her cousin. Really, Miss-- Miss, what's your name?"  i; Crolly," answered Kate, glad of an opportunity of saying something to the enraged woman, which required no greater effort than the pronunciation of one word.  "^^ ^^^ ^^ ^^^ "^^i  .   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       35 "Yes, Crolly; :Miss nrolly. How can a Christian Woman be expected to remember such a name, (thilis was said in an under-breath, but intended to be suf. ficlently loud to hurt the feelings of Kate). , You'll be lifting the window-blinds of a Sabbath after a little, and, by your pernicious example, assisting to undermine and destroy the religious principles of our niece. But, I tell you, Miss--Miss, What's your name?-that. these things cannot continue." Kate Crolly had quietly seated herself, 'sarce know- ing what she was doing. Just as the last words spoken by her aunt had been uttered, Cecilia came dashing into the room. One sharp glance revealed, to her active mind, a knowledge of the situation of affairs. "4 What is this, Aunt? What's the -matter, Kate? ' and Cecilia approached the latter, from whose eyes the tears were fast falling. "Oh, nothing dear Cecilia,' answered- the  aunt; "nothing, I assure you, except an inquiry made by me as to the influence exercised over your mind of late by Mgiss--Miss--, "Miss Crolly, Aunt. It s singular how you do forget Rate's name," said Cecilia, with particular bitterness. "But what do you  mean, aunt, by the influence exer- cised over me by Miss Crolly 9 "  "I mean, dear Cecilia, that you are spoken of by your friends, and-and-many of them remark--that-you- that you are not what you used to be, and even Alvah, during his late visit to us, was observed to be quite changed, in consequence of your association with that young lady," said M rs. Mort on, as she plumped herself into a seat, overcome, or apparently so, by the exertion she had undergone   m delivering herself of the fore. going. Kate and Cecilia preserved a dead silence. Kate -was not fit to speak, and Cecilia dreaded the sound of her own voice at that moment. What strange specimens of  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7146-00000027"/> 36      MOUNT-BENEDICT; OR,  nature those two fine girls presented just then. Kate Crolly, with a gifted mind, a pure spirit within her which- regulated her outer and inner life, a dependents, in one sense, o- the bounty of others, yet feeling her own superior worth; and by the strength of her ;1igiotl  principles, keeping that knowledge in complete abey- ance; a sweet will, always under complete control, and beautifully regulated, so as to produce the greatest harmony in the whole relations of the soul; and a  temper-the fruit of all these-balanced like that of a saint, fitted to bear and to: suffer. while the tward expression of the body betokened an ineffable swe ness that lent a charm of exquisite beauty to the posse o Cecilia Morton bore herself with the dignity of  fended queen. Every nerve was stunga to the utmost. She felt indignant at the language and bearing of her aunt, directed as thse were nst ate, who she really loved and for whom she felt more, muchtore  pain, than if the indignities then flung inthe face ofKlate Crolly had been levelled at herself. Cecilia knew qx- actly her own position in that household, and she knew Kate's also. "If Kate- rather, Miss Crolly," said Cecilia, correct- ing herself, while addressing her aunt, "possess any . influence over me, I am glad of it. Her influence always arises from her own goodness, and I require such influence much more than that sought to be exer- cised over me by others." "' What do you mean, niece?" inquired Mrs. Morton. "Simply what I have said--no more and no less," was Cecilia's abrupt, but truthful answer. Mrs. Morton arose, and stalked out of the room, much to the relief of both Kate and Cecilia. Cecilia's queen-like dignity vanished. Her eyes be- came filled with tears as she approached Kate, and silently took her by the hand.        . KiLte's face had the pallor of death at that moment. ;i   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       37 She heaved a deep sigh of relief and then drew her fingers over her eyes like one awaking from a sleep. In doing so, she left a streak of blood upon her snowy cheek. "What is this?"' cried Cecilia, in a voice of alarm, as she stained her beautiful lips in kissing away what she believed to be the result of violence on the part of her aunt. Kate looked up into the face of her companion and seeing the fresh blood on Cecilia's mouth, became also alarmed in turn. Slight as this incident was, it had a terrible effect on both these girls. Kate surmised one thing and Cecilia another. Kate saw the bloody marks on Cecilia's mouth; Cecilia saw the same on Kate's cheek. The one gazed at the other in amazement. A glance by Kate at the broken Rosary revealed the cause of this unpleasantness, and, with a sad smile, she assured Cecilia that there was no harm done. Cecilia bit her lip with evident displeasure. Kate observed it, and suddenly her whole appearance underwent a change. She seemed as if awaking from a dream. There was a fire-flash darting from Cecilia's eyes and Kate dreaded an outhurst of anger. "How did it happen?"J inquired Cecilia Morton, as she raised herself to her full height and put her ques- tion in the tone of an imperious demand. Kate informed her how Mrs. Morton snatched the Rosary out of her hand and broke it in so doing. A bit of the wire on which the beads were strung entered the flesh of her finger, owing to the sudden jerk made at the Rosary by Mrs. Morton. That, and a few hard and unmeaning charges about religious influence exercised over Cecilia, was all that had happened. Cecilia embraced the drooping'form of her companion,   &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7146-00000028"/> 38      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, and, in so doing, revealed to Kate how violently she trembled. -* I have often bantered you, dear Kate," she said, "' on many things connected with your religion, for which I expressed my sorrow then and now. But in all my wild escapades, I never failed in respect while I observed you engaged in your devotion of the Rosary!" "I am aware of it, Cecilia," was the quiet reply, " and it would have been hard if you had," she added, "'for the same little Rosary was oftener used in your behalf than for anything else." The easy simplicity with which Kate said these words touched Cecilia Morton to the heart. That bright girl, with her strong feelings but honest heart, felt lonely until she met with Kate. There was a*void within her heart which nothing could fill. She felt comforted since Kate Crolly came near to her. She could not tell why, but now she began in some measure to realize the full meaning of her own thoughts. It was not that Kate was extra kind to Cecilia, for reprimands from the former were as often given as com- pliments, althoughthe latter were not withheld at the proper time and seabon. Cecilia knew these things and often wondered at them, for Kate was not older than herself, and "wisdom comes with age," she used to say. Yes; but there is oftentimes wisdom displayed on the part of the young which the aged would do well to profit by. Age, no doubt, is very beautiful when wisdom accom- panies it, but such is not always the case. There is a foolishness in age at times, begotten too of the tender- ness paid to it by youth. In such cases age is doubly to blame, for youth is sickened when its wisdom is met with ingratitude.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       39 CHAPTER VI.     i DREADED SEPARATION-KATE AND CECILIA IN MOUNT BENEDICT CONVENT-THE CAUSE OF THElK VISIT. "'When casting many a look behind, I leave the friends I cherish here,- Perchance some other friends to find, But surely finding none so dear." NEXT day Kate and Cecilia had a long walk and a long talk all to themselves. Cecilia was astonished at the freshness and vivacity of Kate. She expected to find-her careworn and in bad temper after the proceed- ings of the day previous. "Aunt Morton will take good care in future to observe how she conducts herself towards you," said Cecilia. "How? explain, dear Cecilia," said Kate. "You have not, I trust, referred to what took place," she added. "I did, I tell you, and in most emphatic terms, too," was the quick reply. "Then I am likely to lose all the merit of my act," sighed Kate, while her head drooped. "More enigmas, Kate. Lose merit? Lose what? Really, I begin to think you would just as soon wish to have your face slapped as your hand shaken. Have you no spirit-no-what will I call it?" and Cecilia's handsome face was flushed with-well, let us acknowl- edge it-with a little passion. "It was so unnecessary," said Kate. "To-day, dear- Cecilia, I intend leaving you-" "' Leaving me!" exclaimed Cecilia, and ere the words     &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7146-00000029"/> 40      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,       - had passed from her lips, she covered her eyes with her hands. Kate looked around in alarm, but there was no one  present. She and her companion had strolled into a quiet avenue of trees, a little to the east of Mount Ben- edict. "Oh! I knew it would come to this," sobbed Cecilia;  "My poor heart-my poor heart is like to break. But you are not serious, Kate." urged Cecilia, drying her eyes. "My aunt must and will atone for her conduct," she  said. "I promise you that all things will be made right; and, by the tender love you have borne and still bear to  me, recall those hard words," exclaimed Cecilia in a tone of supplication.                     ( "Let me fully explain my mind, dearl, dear Cecilia, and when you have heard me, judge me then," was the reply. "See here, we are just within a few yards of the old tree beneath whose shade we have so often reclined when we used to teaze each other so about love trifles."  Cecilia replied not, but moved forward almost uncon-  sciously. In a few minutes both were seated, and Kate  perceived that quite a change had suddenly come over her companion. Poor Kate Crolly! As she gazed into the face of Ce- cilia her heart beat quicker. She felt that Cecilia, more by instinct than by any other cause, partly divined what she was about to say, and, knowing the girl's inner na- ture much better than Cecilia knew herself, felt deeply grieved at the circumstances which compelled her to. add one drop of grief where she would rather have be- stowed the whole love of her heart. The latter was not wanting, at least in great part, but Cecilia Morton was a girl that felt strongly, and Kate knew that anything tending to divide the relations that then existed between them would induce painful suffering in Cecilia. "You are ill, Cecilia," said Kate, soothingly.    THE VIOLATED TOMB.       41 t Yes," was the only reply. "Then let us defer this unpleasant business till some other time," added Kate, with a wretched attempt at a smile. Cecilia did not reply. "What say you, Cecilia?" whispered Kate. "H--" faltered Cecilia, and a moment afterward she fell back in a swoon. "Oh, my God!" exclaimed Kate, frantically, as she sprang to her feet on beholding the pallid face of Ce- cilia. bc She is dead-dead 1" she shrieked, and, wring- ing her hands, fell over the prostrate form beside her. "Blessed Mother in glory, what is that?" shouted an old woman just then coming forward to the spot indi- cated by the voice she had heard. "Arrah! God be with you both!" she cried, as she observed Kate look around. i"Run fast, my good woman!-some water, some wa- ter!" asked Kate, piteously, addressing the stranger. The old woman ran off as fast as her feet could carry her. It was evident that she was making her way to the Ursuline Convent on MAount Benedict. In a short time she returned, accompanied by two Sisters, one of whom carried a glass of cold water. Instantly they beheld Kate and Cecilia, one of the Sisters embraced Kate, with the exclamation: "My dear child." Kate burst into tears as she beheld Sister Aloysius, whom she had known for some time. "Is there any danger to my friend Cecilia?" was Kate's inquiry, with her hands clasped in a supplicating manner. "She's rather cold,"' the other Sister replied. "What's best to be done?" inquired Sister Aloysius. "O! for heaven's sake let us adopt some measures quickly!" was Kate's earnest appeal.   &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7146-00000030"/> 42      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "Let's take the poor, dear lady to the Convent," quickly suggested the old woman, whose voice just then became known to Kate, and in which she recog- nized Biddy the apple-woman. The two Sisters instantly assented, and Biddy thought  that her part of the business was to carry Cecilia in her arms. In a moment she had lifted the prostrate girl, which act restored Cecilia partly to consciousness, especially as Biddy had liberally applied the cold water in bathing her hands and forehead. Cecilia stared around her, and, beholding the forlorn appearance of Kate, appeared as if endeavoring to com- prehend the situation of affairs. -he-poor, dear girl, while gazing at Kate, gave the latter an imploring look, as if to recall'what she believed to be a forfeited friendship. Kate, in her bewilderment, did not understand the meaning of that look. "Do you think you are able to move a little?" said Sister Aloysius, addressing the half-conscious Cecilia. The latter nodded her assent, and immediately the two nuns gave their assistance. Taking her gently by the arms, they moved slowly along, and at every step Cecilia appeared to gain new strength. Kate and old Biddy kept close behind. "Do you see them starin' villains?" said Biddy, pointing to a batch of rough-looking workmen, appar- ently brick-makers, who kept gazing from an opposite field, where they were located, and by their gestures and general conduct exhibiting a coarseness which was as unmanly as it was insulting. "Don't mind these men," quietly suggested Kate, who observed something like a disposition of resentment in the appearance of Biddy. "God bless you, child, but it's well I'm not as good as you, for then I couldn't gratify my ould spite at them. Av coorse it's not to be expected that one like   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      43 you could be one like me, a sellin' of apples every day, an' hear the impident remarks of them dirty, filthy beins', as I calls them, when they pass me by, axin' if I'm a nunnery woman, an' insultin' me in sich ways." Kate had paid little attention to this complaint of Biddy. Her mind was filled with other, and more serious thoughts just then; nevertheless the general tenor of Biddy's remarks had occupied a place in her mind. Our party just then had entered the Convent gates, not the beautiful front entrance of Mount Benedict, but a back entrance of less imposing appearance. Several nuns presented themselves at -the wicket, wondering what could have happened. They saw Sis- ters Therese and Aloysius with a strange young lady between them, and behind these they observed a pale, delicate-looking creature beside a sturdy old woman. The Mother Superior was instantly called, and be- holding the weak condition of both Kate and Cecilia, ordered them to be taken to the drawing-room and atr tended to at once. Nothing could exceed the tenderness displayed by the good nuns, several of whom appeared on the scene and rendered all the assistance in their power to the young ladies.. Cecilia had a relapse of her swoon, and by orders of Mother Superior, she was conveyed to bed, and a mes- senger despatched for the house physician. Kate shortly rallied, and when the doctor arrived was able to inform him of the cause of Cecilia's illness. The Mother Superior being present, listened intently to every word that fell from Kate's lips. She felt as deeply interested as if the circumstances had concerned her more intimately. "This young lady then must entertain a strong affec- tion for you, I should think," said Mother Superior.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7146-00000031"/> "      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "Yes, Mother, I believe she does not only feel as you say, but that she loves me as if I were a Sister," an- swered Kate, with a sweetness and grace that did not pass unnoticed by the lady to whom she spoke. "But why threaten to leave your companion, then?" "For two reasons," answered Kate. ;'In the first place, it was my intention to seek admission, as a novice, Mother, to Mount Benedict, and secondly, I find it to be impossible to retain my place with my friend's family without being subject to many insults and to much an- noyance, both on account of my creed and country." "Which is your country, dear child?" asked Madame Mary Ann Ursula, the Superioress. "Ireland, Mother," was the brief response. "But a Catholic child from Ireland should put up with many inconveniences, especially when she is situ- ated such as you describe, my dear child," said the Mother Superior with what appeared to Kate a slight tone of severity. "I have put up with many, oh! very many, Madam," urged Kate, while the recollections of all that she had suffered brought a flood of tears to her eyes. That splendid lady, Mother Mary Ann Ursula, looked on the crouching form of the dear child beside her with a strong but well concealed affection. If a tear dimmed the full gray eye of that sainted woman, Kate did not behold it, for her head was bowed as well as her heart. "Cheer up, my good girl," said the Superior. "Learn, my child, that those who would aspire to become daughters of Saint Ursula, must never reject their cross, no matter in what form it pleases Him who bore ours uncomplainingly, to send it. We are not to choose that which would suit our tastes, our temperaments, our de- sires, and what we suppose our strength. Our duty is simply to accept, not to choose, dear-not to choose," and the tears fell fast from the eyes of the lady who   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       45 spoke as if some great feeling had just then overclouded her soul. Kate looked up into that bright but austere face that so few could comprehend, and instantly she felt her heart attracted with a divine sympathy toward the Su- perior. "May I speak to you again, and soon?"In- quired Kate. Yes, my love," tenderly answered the good nun. "Meantime, if you feel able to move along, I would advise you to repair to your companion's home, and make her friends acquainted with her temporary illness. They may feel alarmed, and you are the proper person, to correctly inform them of what has happened." "I shall try, dear Mother; your blessing before I leave." "God bless you, my child. May his holy Mother watch over you, and may his angels guide you now and ;hroughout your life!" Kate took her departure, after receiving the assurance ;hat Cecilia had fallen into a sweet and comfortable leep. o  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7146-00000032"/> "      OUNT BENEDICT; ORB / CHAPTER VII. KATE CROLLY ACCUSED OF SMUGGLINC CECILIA MOR- TON INTO THE CONVENT OF MOUNT BENEDICT. "Blow as ye will, ye winds of fate, And let life's trials blackly lowere;  1 know the garden and the gate,  Ye cannot strip my roseate bower." As Kate left the beautiful convent grounds, she looked  around again and again. She felt as if half her heart  remained behind her. She was accompanied by old Biddy, the apple-woman,  who, with all her good disposition not to open her,  mouth, unless axed a question," could not refrain  from informing Kate that she, too, looked with loving eyes on the place around. Sure an' I do be often wonderin', my lady, if para- dise be much nicer than this sweet place," said Biddy, half afraid for once at the sound of her own voice, and not quite certain whether her remarks would please or displease Kate. "It was a great blessing, my good woman-." "Jist ould Biddy, if it's all the same to my young lady," said the speaker rapidly.  "Well, then, if it must be, Biddy, my name is Kate," was the response. An' may God bless the name; sure Kathleen was the  name of my mother," said Biddy, with every mark of affection, as she uttered what was, perhaps, to her the dearest, the sweetest, the tenderest, and most highly oevereunced name in the whole calendar of the Saints.    THE VIOLATED TOMB.       47 "Yes, Biddy, this is a most enchanting spot," said Kate. "Every motion of the air breathes peace-the flowers are the brightest I ever saw-the trees are the loveliest-the birds the happiest and merriest-the whole place, as you remarked, is like a paradise, Bid- dy," and Kate sighed as she stopped in her journey to gaze around again and again, as if that were the first time that the beauties of Mount Benedict had unfolded themselves to her ardent and admiring gaze. "Och! praises be to Heaven, but it's all you could say about it, dear, even nor you were one of the happy Sisters inside that building," replied Biddy, with her hands clasped, and looking upward into the soft blue sky, as if she expected to find there some confirmation of her praises and ejaculations. Arriving at a spot where it was necessary that Kate and Biddy should part, the latter manifested great joy at having " happened to turn up just at the right min- ute." She prayed that every blessing might attend Kate, and thus satisfied, the earnest, good-hearted Biddy went her way. When Kate arrived at Mr. Morton's, she found mat- ters much as she had left them. After a few minutes spent in her own room, she came down to the parlor and inquired if Mr. Morton was within, hoping anx- iously to be answered in the affirmative. Mr. Morton had not yet arrived from Boston, and Kate was compelled to make known the news of Ceci- lia's illness to his wife. She dreaded the task, but felt that it was her duty to make no delay. Just as Kate was framing the words by-which she should communicate her intelligence, Mrs. Morton dashed into the parlor, and in the most frantic manner demanded to know why our niece had been smuggled into the nunnery. "Oh! base wretch that you are," shouted the en-'  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7146-00000033"/> raged lady, "' the poor working men ran here to inform me of your tricks. Is she poisoned? is she drugged? what devil's spells or magic did you use, girl?' Speak --speak, I say, or I'll-" and forthwith poor Kate, be- fore she had time to utter an intelligible word, was struck on the mouth by the hand of Cecilia's aunt, from the effect of which she fell staggering into a chair. The uproar and noise occasioned by the brutal conduct of his mother, brought the Rev. Alvah Morton, Jr., on the scene. He had just then entered the house, and his surprise may be easily imaggined as he heard the ter- rible din and uproar. ' What is this, mother?" he exclaimed, as he beheld that lady almost frothing at the mouth from the effect of passion, and saw Kate-with the blood streaming from her mouth. "That viper, my son, has smuggled away your cousin into the nunnery-the-the-woman's place-the school -the building, you know.?' 'Into the nunnery, mother! How! What! Ex-. plain, Miss Crolly," urged the gentleman, with his eyes ready to start from their socliets. "We were walking and talking," said Kate, with great difficulty; '; Cecilia took ill, and a glass of water being brought to her by some of the ladies of Mount Benedict, they kindly assisted her into their place. -She had a relapsing swoon, and they gently cared for her for a few hours, and I hastened back to give word lest--" C"It is false!' it is false! T" urged the enraged woman. "Did not two of the brickmakers, who know Cecilia by sight, call here, nor even stop to speak till they, reached my own room, and informed me that Ceciliawtas forced by two women dressed in black to go with them to that nunnery?" "' Is she detained?" asked the Rev. Mr. Morton, ad- dressing Kate.   .... v, laU TOMB.       9  "Go!" was the reply. "I shall go for her at once.  She had fallen into a sleep, and I did not wish to dis- turb her." As Kate finished these few words, uttered with a terri-  ble resolution to suppress her feelings, she wiped her mouth, and the blood-stains on her handkerchief at- attracted the attention of the gentleman whom she addressed. She started as he beheld those signs of what he rightly  guessed to be the result of violence on the part of his mother. He dreaded to have his suspicions confirmed, and yet he felt he could not refrain from speaking of what he had observed.  "I hope you are correct in your statement," he said, approaching Kate. The latter looked into his face with a wondrous look, a sort of silent inquiry which plainly meant, "Do you think I am telling a lie?" The Rev. Alvah Morton properly interpreted that look, and answered it. "Excuse me," he continued, "I thought that violence  had been used by some one to Cecilia and yourself, Miss Crolly, and that you were endeavoring, for our sake, to  make it appear as slight as possible." "There was no violence, sir, used by any one to either of us, out of doors." "But those blood-stains?" "Are the effects of your mother's violence since my arrival here, to inform her of Cecilia's illness." "Indeed!" "Indeed, sir."  "Mother, this charge of Miss Crolly is strange to  me," said the Rev. Alvah to Mrs. Morton. "What charge?" inquired that lady. Her son repeated it. In the moment of my desolation of spirit, my son, I approached that girl, and if by accident-by accident,  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7146-00000034"/> 50      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, remember-my hand came in contact-in contact, ob- serve--without intention, without inclination, with her hand or her cheek, and, being possessed of a ma- ternal love for your Cousin, for our niece, and learning from those honest workmen I have alluded to, that Ce- cilia was entrapped and smuggled into that woman's place, that nunnery, I got frantic, as I am this moment, lost all my patience, and may have by accident-by ac- cident, remember-brought my hand into contact-into contact, observe-with that girl's lying mouth." The son endeavored to conciliate the outrageous mother, and the mother refused to be conciliated by the son. Just then Mr. Alvah Morton, Sr., entered, and looked around him with staring eyes and open mouth at all he saw. His wife rushed towards him, exclaiming, Our niece-our niece I " "What of her?" shouted the elder Mr. Morton. "Is Cecilia sick-dead?" ", Worse," screamed the wife of Mr. Morton. "Worse; how? Explain, woman!" cried the hus- band. "Gone, entrapped, smuggled-" Entrapped-smuggled? Where to? What is this? Is there no one to speak?" His son made an attempt to explain, but Mrs. Mor- ton's mind was too full to permit of any one rendering an explanation except herself. Our niece-ouR more than daughter-OUR Cecilia is smuggled into a nunnery!" Mr. Morton's fears vanished immediately. He cast a glance towards Kate, but that young lady was just then engaged in reviewing a portion of her past life: thinking of her brothers, Patrick and Owen, and wondering how they would feel, if they were alive and present, to know how much she suffered.   THE VIOLATED TOMB. Kate Crolly was thinkingtoo, of the strange words uttered to her by the-good Mother  Superior, about the different order of the crosses we have to bear. The consideration of these matters gave to Kae a kind of mournful pleasure. By their aid, she entered into an analysis of her own mind tofind, if possible, poor thing, how far she had been guilty in causing iss Morton'sg sudden illness, by making known to Cecilia her inten- tion of leaving her. Poor, unfriended Kate Crolly  Possessed of a soul over which scarce a shadow of sin had left a trace; whose heart yearned with a fulness of divine love seldom experienced by any creature in the outer world, listened to all that was spoken in her presence if she had no hearing; while at the same time, her heart was painfully acute to the base and hypocritical insinuations of her lady employer. It was a hard task for that poor Irish girl to maintain herself as she did. Young, beautiful, and accomplished (the latter owing to her ndoitable perseverance), she hardly felt her own superiority, but dare not acknowl edge even that to herself. Dear girl, thy beauty of person was eclipsed by the rarer beauty of thy mind, and thy mind was so trained by s elf-sacrifice as to beget a humility that elevated thee even in the eyes of God, while that same humility made the heart glow even while thine eyes beheld the blood from thy mouth and hand. Rare patience! How few Kate Crollys bless the world at present; and yet Kate had learned her best and practical lessons at the Convent of MovrUT BENEDICT.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7146-00000035"/> 52      MOUNT BENEDICT; Or               :'i CHAPTER VIII.

"May every weed, and woe, and thorn Out of your destined path be torn I May all for whose delight you live Pay back the bliss you're born to give." "MAY I ask the privilege of a word??" said Kate, ad- dressing Alvah Morton, Sen. "Why, certainly, child," was the instantaneous reply. "Then your niece, Miss Cecilia-" "Is here, love," cried out a faint voice, as Cecilia Mo0r- ton appeared at the parlor door in company with two nuns from Mount Benedict. Mrs. Morton did not faint, neither did she turn pale; but, on the contrary, she got very red in the visage', and looked with a strange, piercing gaze at the humble ap- pearance of the ladies who accompanied Cecilia, A few words sufficed to explain to her relatives the cause of Cecilia's absence. And after returning her thanks to the good nuns in such a manner as to astonish her aunt and please Kate, these good, kind ladies re- tired, expressing a hope that Miss Morton would not in future be a stranger at Mount Benedict. Kate Crolly forgot all her physical and mental pains as she heard Cecilia give the Sisters, who had kindly accompanied her homeward, an assurance that she would pay them a visit soon, nor be a stranger in the future.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       53 "Oh, what a delightful place, dear Aunt!" said Ce- cilia, immediately after the Sisters had taken their de. parture. "Delightful place, indeed!" sneered that most an- gelic piece of Puritanical humanity.  "Delightful place!" she continued, rising -and pacing the floor of the room in a state of great agitation. "Oh! that I should-ever have lived to see the day that my house should be--should be contaminated by the presence of those black creatures! , screamed Mrs. Morton, still red in the face; or, rather, now purplish, for that amiable lady had wrought herself into a high state of excite- ment. "Mother, you should respect yourself!" suggested the Rev. Alvah Morton. "Yes, dear Aunt, you should respectyourself, and us too, repeated Cecilia, with a tone of bitter irony in her remarks, which did not escape the attentive ears of those present.  Were you not smuggled, Cecilia?" asked Mrs. Mor- ton. "Speak the truth, child. Were you not snmuog- gled into that woman's place, and drugged to make you' appear ill? Speak the truth, child. And did you not see bones and haih? Remember you speak the truth, child." "Go to your room," said Mr. Morton, in a stern-voice, addressing his wife. "Don't you see the girl lauhing at you?" he added in an  undertone. "To my room, under such circumstances! , was the haughty reply of the lady. "Mother," said the younger gentleman, " pray keep cool, and do not permit such a trifling circumstance as this appears to be to put you into such unchristian dis- order."

It seemed as if she had been working for the accomplishment of that end all along. "Understand me," shrieked that lady, as she rose to depart, "' the poor, dear, good, honest workmen in Cutter's field could not pass my door to-day with peace to their own souls without informing me of the base attempt at kidnapping our niece. Ah! Cecilia, if you only knew-if you only knew the maternal heart- burnings of this maternal breast"-and Mrs. Morton struck her bosom with dramatic effect-", you would pity, you would cherish-" uttering which Mrs. Morton was half carried out of the parlor by the combined aid of son and husband. "Heaven is kind, dear Kate, in releasing us from Aunt's presence. Oh, what dear, good ladies, Kate. I love them all, and the oldest in particular"-saying which, Cecilia flung her arms about Kate's neck, inform- ing her that she had something pleasant to communi- cate. Kate smiled at the vivacity of Cecilia, and quietly pressed her hand as she desired her to proceed and tell all the pleasant things she had to relate. "Mother Lady-isn't that her name?" inquired Ce- cilia. l Mother Superior," said Kate. "Well, then, Mother- Superior," continued Cecilia, "kept near to me all the time, and oh! never shall I forget the tender expression of her eyes as I beheld her stoop over me and refresh my lips with a glass of water. She laughed as I recovered, and sat down beside me, and laying her hand on my knee told me, dear Kate, what you so often told me before." "What was that?" inquired Kate, with awakened cu- riosity. "That I was a bad, wild girl." "Oh! nonsense, Cecilia. I thought you were speak- ing seriously."     THE VIOLATED TOMB.      55 "So I am, Kate," continued Cecilia, with a changed expression of countenance. "Mother Superior insisted on knowing what made me ill. She seemed almost to know my own thoughts. I told her all about your sol- emn determination, and added that I really should go wild and bad if deprived of your company. ' But why,' she, asked, ' be deprived of Kate's company?' And then at once she informed me that I, too, might enter the con- vent," said Cecilia hurriedly, and with a joyous laugh that reached the ears of Aunt Morton. "But you do not contemplate such a step?" asked Kate. "You know there are many barriers." "Nonsense., Kate; only to enter as a pupil. Don't you understand me? When I mentioned to Mother Su- perior what appeared to me indeed as a barrier, that I was not a Roman Catholic, she smiled and told me that nearly all the young ladies in Mount Benedict were Prot- estant like myself." "That is quite true," said Kate, " and I am astonished at my own forgetfulness in not mentioning that to you before now."   - "And, besides," continued Cecilia, "Uncle Morton, I know, is most anxious to have me enter a high-class school; and where could I find anything to equal Mount Benedict Convent for that purpose?" "I admit the truth of what you allege, Cecilia, but you know the frightful intolerance of your aunt, and the very mention to her of such a determination on your part would, I verily believe, drive her half mad." "If her intolerance drove her whole mad, dear Kate, I cannot see that that is any reason for me to forego my  good intentions regarding myself."'  "But consider again, Cecilia," urged Kate. -"Your resolution to enter the convent as a pupil will be as- cribed, and with some show of reason, too, to your re- gard for me. Now, God knows I have siffered enough  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7146-00000037"/> 566      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,  unjustly, and at the hands of-your aunt, too, without  suffering anything additional."  "Kate Crolly! I am both ashamed and displeased to  hear you-you, I say-utter such things. In the first place, I have always understood you to lay great stress on the merit of suffering, and which merit was always lessened by speaking of, or alluding even in the rempt- est way, to whatever we suffered. And in the next place, if I understood you aright, you were going to leave us for good, so that the displeasure of Aunt or any one else could not reach you after your departure."  I confess, candidly, Cecilia-"  "Wait one moment. I have not finished. And oi more than one particular occasion you specially recommended me to obtain, if possible, a finished education in such an establishment as that at Mount Benedict." "You are right, quite right in every word you hayit uttered, and I bless Heaven to hear you speak as yo  do. But these things took place before our late visit to Mount Benedict, and I did imagine, dear Cecilia, that you felt somehow displeased after that visit." "Not exactly displeased, but I felt well; I can scarce tell it now, but I know that I experienced a great change come over mein spite of myself, and I was annoyed at not resisting that feeling with greater strength of will than I seemed then to possess." Kate Crollywas more than astonished to hear such remarks fall from the lips of Cecilia Morton. She bit- terly regretted having mentioned the sufferings she had endured at the hands of Mrs. Morton; and, to add to her sorrow, here was the very girl whom she had been endeavoring faithfully to instruct, now turned teacher instead of pupil. Kate forgot her own tender years In thus accusing herself. She imagined that her dependent position had made her older than she was, but the real truth of the . .... ..    THE VIOLATED TOMB.       57 matter was, that she dreaded her Influence over Cecilia. She naturally believed that the intention of her com- panion to become a pupil at Mount Benedict arose from a desire on Cecilia's part to be near at hand, so that their friendship might not be interrupted. Kate was wrong in her surmises; but even if she had been right, why did that trouble her. That was a question which caused great perplexity to Kate herself. Kate was very good, but she did not care to examine her own heart on this point. She loved Cecilia ardently, and often, aye, very often, prayed for her; and yet, the knowledge that Cecilia had formed the resolution of entering the convent annoyed Kate to a degree which she could not account for. Let the truth be told, even as concerns Kate Crolly. Beautiful and good she was, kind and loving, careful of others, much more so than of herself, and as for Cecilia, there was scarcely any sacrifice she was not prepared to make in her behalf. Kate had determined on quitting the world. Not that she found herself in a strange land, and bereft of the care of all friends and relatives; not that her dear brother Patrick was either far removed from her-or dead, she could not say which; not that Owen lived happily in Ireland, where her heart's best affections were centred. No; for none of all these things; but that she desired to devote herself entirely to God, and even selfishy wished that no person should be near to her to disturb the repose she so much desired. We may judge her astonishment, then, when Cecilia Morton informed her that her late determination to enter the Ursuline Convent of Mount Benedict arose altogether from the changed feelings she possessed in consequence of the kindness shown her by the Mother Superior, and the nuns who accompanied her homeward, after her late temporary illness.   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7146-00000038"/> 58      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Then it was not in consequence of Kate's expressed wish to enter the Convent as a novice, with a view to the taking of the black veil, that influenced Cecilia! After a full and thorough explanation of these things, the two girls separated for the night. Kate remained long out of bed, thinking and praying.' In fact, it would not be stretching matters of this kind too far, to say that every thought of Kate was a prayer. She was troubled, deeply troubled, and could not help reflecting on such things. She did not repine at these troubles, although they were poignant enough to have caused a storm of feeling in the breasts of others less masters of themselves than Kate Crolly. For that particular reason, her thoughts and reflections were prayers-prayers without words, their language being the unspoken language of the heart. She dwelt upon them, and so sat u till a late hour. Cecilia retired, with her heart and soul suddenly refreshed, and shortly afterwards fell into a sweet slumber. The picture! Kate Crolly-the earnest, faithful, and devout Kate, suffering in heart and body, poor and without friends, save the friendship of Cecilia Mortn-knelt for hours at her devotions.  Cecilia-the beautiful and well-cared-for, the extrava- gant child; sometimes wayward, and often fretful; dis- posed to worry and find fault, yet truthful and sincere in all her acts; fighting against the truth enunciated by her own soul to-day, and to-morrow bending to the dictates of her heart's honesty-lay profoundly asleep.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       59 CHAPTER IX. TIIE ABDUCTION OF CECILIA MORTON-STRANGE SIGHTS AND SCENES. "  O fear not in a world like this I And thou shalt know ere long- Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong."  MR. MORTON'S household had retired to rest two hours and more. Not a soul was astir nor awake, if we except the piously-inclined Kate Crolly. The moon had risen and cast her beams on all around. The night was murky and cold for that season of the year. It was but the beginning of August, and yet the wind swept fitfully through the trees, and at times caused a thick, dark cloud to obscure the light that would otherwise have shed a radiance on every leaf. Occasionally the wind whistled a strange, mournful dirge, that rather added to than detracted from the silent meditations of Kate Crolly. Kate turned over in her mind all those things that Cecilia had uttered during the evening. She thought of them again and again, and eventually looked upon the kindness of the Mother Superior towards Cecilia as a sort of Providence in winning over that girl's love to the Convent. She felt rejoiced at the turn affairs had taken, and although she naturally desired to feel some sort of re- sentment towards Mrs. Morton, yet the poor, dear girl had so far become master of herself as not only to par-  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7146-00000039"/> 60      -MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, don that lady for her many unkindnesses and acts of violence, but to pray for her. This attempt caused Kate to perform a somewhat . difficult task; but she managed it, and felt all the better for the great victory she had accomplished over herself. Many people of the world will wonder at Kate Crolly's self-abnegation, but many, very many people of the world have yet to learn the value of such an act per- formed by a poor, friendless girl. The conduct of Kate in her forgiveness of Mrs. Mor- ton, and the conduct of those who would probably despise that girl for rising superior to herself, is, after all, one of the great distinctions observable, even at the present day, between the good and the bad, the Wise and the unwise, of our, and of every generation. It required no small amount of training for Kate to reach this point of perfection, nevertheless she managed it, and thanked Heaven for her success. The room occupied by Kate in Mrs, Morton's house was a small back apartment, on the first floor, neither remarkable for its convenience nor its comfort. It served Kate, however, for that girl's wants were few, and even those few not hard to satisfy. After finishing her devotions, Kate retired to rest. She could not sleep, in consequence of her mind being then occupied with many thoughts concerning the transactions of the day then past. She bitterly felt the hardship of her position, and being of a sensitive nature see keenly felt the full force of all the difficulties she had been compelled to encounter and endure. These , thoughts filled her mind, and kept her awake long after the time she should have been at rest. "Have you them  instruments?" whispered Jack Buzzard to Rat Keeley, as these worthies, in company   THE VIOLATED TOMB.   "   with Harry Craze and Henry Buck, approached the domicile of Mr. Morton. "Well, we should think so,' answered Keeley, ap- proaching Buzzard, who was then mounted on a short ladder which just reached to the sill of the window of Kate drolly's room. * At itp em ere, and be d-- d to you wwas the ugly response of Buzzard. Several heavy bars of iron, strange looking hinple- ments-they appeared to be, were then handed tip to Jack Buzzard, who begarn to feel his position unsatisfactory, both as regarded the safetW of his footing and the enter- prise he was engaged in. ' The devil's in them; couldn't. you have put them up easier than that?" hissed Buzzard, through his teeth. "Are yotu sure that's the rightplace? asked Keeley, in a husky tone. "Quite sure-hang, your long throat. Weren't I in the place a dozen times, and there's no one here nor within a good reach of us. Look sharp, now, and let not two of you get on to this old pair of crossbars, or you'll have a smash down, and break your crooked neTks before your time." "All right, old boy," said Harry Buck, by way of en- couragement; ", leave that to us. Our necks are as valuable as anybody's else.' ' Hand me the dark lantern," said Buzzard, while in a stooping position. "Higher," he cried out in a tone of voice that startled Kate from the half sleep into which she had just fallen. The jerk given to the lantern by Buzzard sent a sud- den gleam of light throtiughout her little rooms which plainly revealed to her that a burglary, or worse, was then being attempted. Kate's first impulse was to scream; but she knew that while the sound of her voice could not possibly reach  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7146-00000040"/> aUn Uvcni VI UM MMUF"S ULBUJL uiaIG VJL UI1t; UVUUIP IJLt XLo@U possibly cost her her life. It was but the work of a few moments for Kate to dart from her room as noiselessly as possible, before the window was raised. A few seconds sufficed to bring her into Cecilia's apartment, the same that had served the purposes of both, until Mrs. Morton insisted on a separation, for the benefit of the health of both girls t A sudden shake speedily aroused Cecilia, but it was with the greatest po-ssible difficulty that Kate succeeeded in making known to her the events here briefly recorded. When she had comprehended them, however, she was not long in discerning the nature of the situation, and her quick-witted instincts told her that silent action was the first thing necessary. Catching Kate by the arm, rather nervously for Kate's comfort, she whispered into her ear: "You must go down again into your own room--a quick glance will enable you to see if it is occupied. No doubt there will be a watch placed outside, to give warning of danger from that quarter. Once into your room, lock the door, and before any attempt to return has been made, I will have the house alarmed, and the burglars will be caught in a net. Quick, dear Kate. Away." Kate stole softly down the stairs, and meeting no im. pediment, wondered at the stillness of the place. Her brain was on fire with excitement. She could scarcely  believe her senses. X At moments she imagined that she " saw a dozen of rough looking men, then she would stop for a few seconds to recover -herself, and peer keen-  ly into the semi-visible darkness before her. At times she imagined the house to be full of strange looking, horrible creatures, and the next instant all around her appeared lonely, cold, and desolate. The poor girl clasped her head in her hands, and felt her forehead to be icy-cold. Her lips seemed glued together. Was   she dreaming, or did she suffer from some terrible night- mare? Vainly she endeavored to believe that she was suffering in some unnatural way; but then the feeling. came over her mind that she was awake, and that all that was then passing through her mind was a terrible reality. To convince herself, she fell upon her knees, and with her eyes and hands raised upward to Heaven, besought God to enable her to understand the nature of her position. Just as her thoughts were thus engaged, there arose a sharp and deadly shriek, a painful scream, that echoed through every part of the house. Kate jumped to her feet, and as fitful glances of light appeared be- fore her eyes, she thought she perceived two men hur- rying down a backward stair, with Cecilia Morton in their arms I She tried to scream, but could not; her limbs seemed to lose their natural strength, and in her effort to advance, she fell flat on the floor I Another scream from Cecilia, and Kate Crolly sprang from her lethargy. Instantaneously she seemed gifted with a new life. Without one moment's further thought, she rushed through the house, sounding an alarm that was well calculated to rouse every individual therein. Mr. Morton was the first to appear on the scene. Di- rected by the sound of Kate's voice, he was speedily in her presence, and earnestly inquired the cause of er screams. A  few seconds sufficed to explain, and Kate used signs as well as words to make the apparently terrified gentleman understand the nature of what had happened. Darting from her presence, Mr. Morton slipped back to the room of his son Alvah. After the excitement had passed, or rather partially ceased, Kate Crolly fell off again into a state of semi- unconsciousness. The last sound she heard was the report of fire-arms.  &#xD;<pb n="64" xml:id="VAC7146-00000041"/> "      MOUNT BENEDICT  OR, CHAPTER X. PROCEEDINGS DURING  THE ABDUCTION OF CECILTA MORTON-A MRACULOUS ESCAPE-DISCONMFITURE OF THE VILLAINS. "I have read in the marvellous heart of man, That strange and mystic scroll, That an army of phantoms vast and wan, Beleaguer the human soul." "ARE you wounded, Jack?" asked Rat Keeley of his companion, as they hurried along in the wake of Harry Craze, who bore the insensible form of Cecelia Morton in his arms. "I guess so, but what matter," answered Buzzard. Them devil's didn't seem to care much whether a fel- low got a " nut" in his stomach or the back of his head, confound them for fools." Keeley laughed heartily at his companion's remarks, and no doubt wondered, at least a little, at the sang froid of the fellow in complaining of the efforts made by Mr. Morton's family to prevent the abduction of Ce- cilia. He seemed to possess a partial knowledge, at least, of the feelings of the bereft and injured family, and thus displeased his rough companion, Buzzard. Harry Craze soon began to tire of his burden, and there- fore came to a dead halt. "Give a hand here," he bawled forth, as he beheld blood issue from the mouth of poor Cecilia, who had been ruthlessly gagged, and had fallen into a stupor in consequence.   &#xD;<pb n="Illustration" xml:id="VAC7146-00000042"/>

C5 More than one pair of hands aided Craze in the task he had undertaken, of being chief rascal in the business he was then engaged. Buzzard and Keeley both offered to divest Craze of his burden, but he declined. He had some sort of be- lief that he would manage afterward to make it appear that the principal part of that night's difficulty had fallen to him, and therefore he was anxious to bear his burden longer. "Which way now? , he cried out, as the party entered the beautiful road leading to the rear of the Convent of Mount Benedict. A shady pathway, with trees on either side, was the place now entered on by those merciless ruffians, in the expectation, no doubt, that the solitude of the place would aid them in the consummation of their villainous designs. , "Lay her down for a minute or two," suggested Buz- zard, " and give her breath, or our I chinksI will be no- where to-morrow." Craze was not hard to persuade. He felt more than tired; he was trembling with excitement, and, not being desirous, of handing over his charge to his fellows, yielded to their request of taking a little rest. For one like him, and considering his nature in his then evil mood, and the private object which seemed to possess him more than ought else, he Iaid his -tender bur- den down as softly as possible. In so doing, he also re- moved the gag from the mouth of his helpless victim, believing, no doubt, that he had sufficiently stifled any attempt on her part to raise an alarm. He was right, in that conjecture, at least., "Give her a kick in the side, if she opens her mouth,'" said Buzzard, addressing his companion, "No; I ain't inelined', muttered Craze. I'd sooner give you a touch of what you tasted before. She is here  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7146-00000044"/> "      MOUNT BENEDICT; 0R, now, and bad as our work is, I guess your feeling is prompted by the blank shot you got so frightened at." Buzzard was stung to the quick by this reply to what he, in his villainous nature, considered some sort of compliment to Craze. He was completely taken aback by the language of Craze, for he really did not expect it, and, accordingly, his bile and temper rose in propor- tion to that which he considered some sort of a reflec- tion on his character. "It was more for yourself and your tiredness I spoke," said Jack Bulzzard; " and if you don't choose to go on quickly with this business to its end, or, if you have any idea of breaking down like a sheep-" "Like a what?" sternly demanded the apparently outraged Craze. "Break down like a sheep! Why, you cowardly cur, we had all the difficulty in the world to make you act half the part of a man in this work of to-night, and yet you-curse you, for a fool-" and Harry Craze seemed at that moment of heated passion and remorse, as if the gag he had just lately removed from the bleeding mouth of Cecilia Morton had entered hi-s own, so much was he overcome by the taunts of his criminal confrere, Buzzard. Keeley and Buck endeavored to conciliate their companions by informing them that although the place they were then passing through with their charge was quiet and secluded, nevertheless, a chance might occur which would attract some passer-by, and deprive them of the valuable subject they had that night obtained for a certain consideration. ' I ain't a bit too clear on the whole of this business," said Henry Buck, after Craze had deposited his poor, suffering victim on a little grassy knoll. "Nor I," said'Keeley. "Are you as blind as bats?" uttered Buzzard, " after the hints we gave you when old Morton's skipper tucked us the nod."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       67 "I guess we are as blind as bats," replied Henry Buck, "when it is well known that we all four believed there was a certain sum to be given for the safe lifting of that girl, and placing her in the hands of the fellow, and nothing more." "But we have over two miles to go yet," muttered Buzzard; "1 and damn me, but if there's any more gab or chat about this young 'un, I'll put the contents of this pistol into the heart or head of the man who raises the first objection to the finishing of this job." To Keeley and Buck this language appeared more as a kind of peace-offering to Craze, than anything like the expression of a determined scoundrel to continue in his brutal and villainous course. To the last two men- tioned men there was a spice of unpleasant threat in the words of Buzzard, whom they knew, however, to be a cowardly bravo. "Don't heed takin' about them I irons,"' said Rat, Keeley, with a most unpleasant-emphasis in his bantering tone. "Your 'barkers' are no louder nor ours, nor perhaps half so straight in their line." Buzzard was stung to the quick by the taunt of his companion, and immediately made a move towards him, apparently with a hostile intent. Meantime, Craze had stooped down to find how Cecilia Morton fared. "Damnation!" shouted Harry Craze, with a voice that appeared just then as if it had pro- ceeded from some doomed spirit rehabilitated with mortality. Is it me you mean?" roared out Buzzard. "If so, I think I'm suffering enough here in my shoulder to make me understand your ' damnation,' and I only wish that you had the same kind of smashed up bone," he cried out, putting up his hand to the apparently afflicted shoulder. "That's the spot where the bullet entered!" said   &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7146-00000045"/> 68      MOUNT BENEDICT; OB, Henry Buck, with a sneering tone. "Let all around feel it2" he added. "Maybe it's the spot where Craze gave him the double thump!" said Rat Keeley. The exasperation of Jack Buzzard at these taunts knew no bounds. He fumed like a maniac. He had received no wound after leaving the premises of Mr. Morton, as he had led his companions to believe. During this slight altercation, Harry Craze remained like a man struck dumb. He was more than bewildered. He was terribly shocked and stupefied, and for the life within him, was unable to account for the unexpected disappearance of the abducted Cecilia. It was quite dark, or nearly so. The moon had ap- peared only occasionally, and even then fitfully. Had the earth opened and swallowed Miss Morton? Had the body and soul of that girl taken wings and left the earth behind? What could have happened? Such were the thoughts and exclamations of the villain, Harry Craze, whose mind just then was a torture between that of the self-accusing, hardened villain, and the disappointed wretch who had hoped to receive a large amount of money for his wicked perpetration that night. When his companions came to properly understand what had happened, their wrath knew no bounds. At first they actually believed that Craze had in some mysterious way permitted Cecilia Morton to escape. In the intensity of their bewilderment they never imagined that the poor, frightened, and half-murdered victim of their violence, was utterly unable of herself to do more than move. But, thanks to their loud-tongued disputes, and their incautious belief of the safety and darkness of the hour and place, they did not compre- hend the possibility of anything in the shape of aid to Cecilia.

Buzzard, like an evil bird of prey, was the first to suggest this, and, as he promised to stand the expenses, his character was somewhat raised in the estimation of his vile companions.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7146-00000046"/>  CHAPTER XI. KATE CROLLY'S BROTHER IN A NEW SCENE-BIDDY THE APPLE-WOMAN ON RASH JUDGMENT - RESCUE OF CECILIA MORTON. "In the world's broad field of battle, In the bivouac of life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle- Be a hero in the strife I*' PASSING over a road that lay in the vicinity of Mount Benedict, without any special purpose or intent, that night when Cecilia Morton was torn from her home, was a man of gentlemanly appearance, who was ac- costed by old Biddy the apple-woman as follows :- Lt Shure, then, if one is to judge by appearance, I would say, blessed be God, that I behold a kind gentle- man who would give a poor creature like myself a helpin' hand with-this trifle of a load, and help it on to my head." "Certainly, my good woman," replied the stranger. "Musha, then, may the good turn come out to your own advantage, in more ways than one," was the kind- ly and hearty expression of thanks, on the part of the old woman. "But surely you cannot have far to go with this load, otherwise you'll never be able to accomplish your journey," said the stranger. "Not very far, sir; but, you see I'm quite tired. I carried that bag of pippins more than two miles from I here, an' I had only three rests in the whole o' the journey." -1   71   "And how far may you have to go before you reach the end of your journey, may I ask?" "Faith, a good Irish mile, or more; but, as I'm well rested, an' have only tha last mile to go, sure its Biddy herself that won't think much of that taste of trouble." "Take rest for a few minutes longer," said the gen- tieman, who then laid his hand on the well-filled bag, or sack, and, testing its weight, wondered how an old woman, like his suddenly found companion, could have managed to carry it so far. "Here is a poor old creature," he reflected, " whose probable earnings to-morrow will begin with a single penny, laboring hard to carry home her little store of fruit, which, even had she got for the carrying, would, to her, be earned dearly enough.' And here am I, Patrick Crolly, tired and fatigued both in mind and body, no doubt, in searching for my dear sister Kate; what if I threw the bag and its contents on my shoulder, and shortened the last mile for the poor fruit-seller. A good turn is often repaid in ways. we don't often imagine-so here. goes." "Maybe, sir, I have asked too much of you," began Biddy, by way of remembrance, and who was getting rather uneasy at what she believed to be a decent sort of quiet refusal on the part of the stranger to assist her as  required. "Pardon me, my good friend; I was just engaged with my thoughts for a little time. You must be very tired, and as I am stronger than you, I ask the privilege of carrying this bag right away to the end of your journey." "Arrah, nonsense sure my old shoulders wouldn't demean themselves by allowin' a bag of dirty apples-I beg your pardon, sir, I mean a dirty bag of apples- that is, I mean-I mean a load like that, for a gentle- man-" and before Biddy 'had time to frame a legitimate excuse Patrick Crolly had hoisted the bag, sweet and  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7146-00000047"/> 72      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, clean as its contents, on his shoulder, notwithstanding the desire of the owner to depreciate the burden. "Come along now; you go foremost and We'll soon break the heart of the burden." said Biddy's compan- ion. Biddy did as she was desired, and, after the ex- citement that such a turn of affairs had taken in her re- gard had subsided, Biddy began to Imagine that the strange gentleman had some evil intention in his nmind, otherwise he would never have condescended to act the part he had undertaken. Instead of feeling a sense of relief, Biddy felt a heavy burden had only been removed from her aching shoullders to be placed on her heart. "Sure it's a villain he must be, although in the guise of a gentleman. Och! the divil a gentleman ever I met but poor auld Andy hmself-God rest his soul. But the murderin' villain, he'll soon find out that, tired an' all as I am, I'm fit to purtect myself against a dozen of gentlemen like him." Such were Biddy's thoughts as Patrick Crolly assisted her in the heavy and unpleasant work of the evening. 'An' maybe its eatin' my fine fruit he'll be after awhile," said Biddy. "Well, only let him try it, an' he'll find that I'm well rested an' able to stand by the ould bag." Biddy had thus girded herself for an imaginary fight when suddenly her companion dropped his load and ex- claimed-"- Did you hear that strange, gurgling noise over there, somewhere?" b' A gur- what noise did you say, sir?" ' A noise of queer sounds, as if somebody was in dis. tress. The sound of a woman's voice, just as it she had been released from-listen, there it is again!" Biddy listened, and, feeling satisfied that her ears did not deceive her. replied: "I do indeed, sir, hear some- thing strange-like. Let us hurry on an' we'll soon dis- cover what it means." Meantime poor old Biddy's heart relented. "He can't   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       73 be such a bad gentleman, after all. God bless him, as I had supposed. Och, God be between us an' harm!" she inwardly ejaculated. ' It's our poor selves who are the very first to think ill of our best friends." Again a troubled, smothered cry burst on the night air. Biddy heard it as well as Patrick Crolly. "Keep to the right, sir, over the field there," said Biddy, with a sort of choking sensation iu her throat. "Why to the right, my good woman?" "My ears never deceive me. sir. f know it, I know it. Keep to the right, sir--do. sir. please " Biddy's companion did as desired, and in a few min- utes afterward stopped suddenly and dropped the bag of fruit. The apple-woman seemed just then to have given up all idea of the safety of her little store. Her womantly heart was awakened to a moan of distress. What the cause was she could not deterainei, yet 8he felt that somehow she had a duty to perform. Before her thoughts could take shape, her companion had dropped on his knees, and, laying his ear close to the ground, listened for a few moments. Biddy peered into the semi-darkness, not so much for the purpose of judging the apparent honesty of the gen- tleman who had thus accompanied her so far, as that of trying to satisfy herself that some humautheing was then in an unknown state of suffering. "Drop down on your knees here," said Crolly, " and help me to know if I'm right." Biddy did as desired, and immediately afterward ut- tered a groan of pain. "What now?" asked Crolly. "God an' His Mother be between us an' evil, but that's the voice of Miss Crolly's companion!" "Miss Crolly! Miss-what did you say, old woman? Speak, in Heaven's name!

What Miss Crolly do you mean?" : "Oh, dear sir, there's danger here, somehow. Don't ask me questions just now-there! did you not hear the mnoan of a poor cratur? In God's name what can all this mean?" and Biddy sprang to her feet in order to make a forward rush. i Stop, woman!" cried Patrick Crolly. . Remain as you are t " and the speaker dragged Biddy backward as if she had been but a child. ' Quiet, now, for your life!"n he said. "Heiwnau here only a few seconds, and I shall speedily return." Patrick Crolly took advantage of a moment's tempor- ary darknessi and crept on all fours to the spot indicated by the distressing sounds he bad heard. Immuediately he beheld a lady lying on a small grassy molilud. Beside her were four men of rough aspect, earnestly engaged discussing the removal of the lady. With a peculiar instinct, almost natural to such quick- witted men as Crolly, that gentleman instantly compre- hended the full nature of the position in which he found himself thus suddenly placed. Taking advantage of a loud discussion on the part of the ruffians, engaged in their evil and desperate work of abducting Cecilia Morton, Patrick Crolly managed to approach that young lady, and by some sign or an- other communicated to her that he was her friend. Released as it were from death to life, Cecilia listened to the words of the unknown gentleman. The kindly tone of his voice, the protestation of his friendship, and a hurried explanation of the manner in which he had discovered her sad condition, gave an assurance to Cecilia that made her poor heart throb for joy. "Directing her how to lean on his shoulder, and   beseeching her to pardon him for his manner of assist- ing her, Patrick Crolly literally carried his precious burden to the place occupied by Biddy, without so much as being even slightly observed by the ruffians who had almost effected her abduction. A few minutes sufficed for this, and between the tor- rent ofthanksgiving offered by Biddy, who did not even half comprehend the exact nature of affairs, and the half-articulated thanks of Cecilia, Patrick Crolly found himself in a position such as he never even dreamed of in his whole previous life. - He felt like a giant in point of physical strength, and yet like a mere child, considering the strange position in which he then stood. He was almost breathless after his late exertion, and the anxiety that filled his mind, lest his late undertaking might prove unsuccessful in the end, nearly upset him, and for some minutes he scarcely knew, as he himself after. wards expressed it, " whether his head was on or off his shoulders." OO! then, gracious goodness-an' may God be praised and may the Lord of Heaven look down on us this night! exclaimed the warm-hearted poor Biddy, as Patrick Crolly deposited his burden beside her. The moon was shining in its fullest brightness just then, and Biddy at once recognized the face of a young lady she had seen before. "I was right," she said. The light which thus served to enable the good-heart- ed apple-woman to observe the features of Cecilia Mor- ton, intensified the darkness of the spot then occupied by that lady's abductors. Patrick Crolly felt inclined to kneel down and offer his heartfelt thanks to God for thus being enabled to rescue a human being from some terrible, theough unseen misery.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7146-00000049"/> 76      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,               CHAPTER XI.  CECILIA MORTON ASSISTED TO THE CONVENT OF MOUNT BENEDICT. ...... "Land of the Madonna How beautiful it is I It seems a garden Of Paradise." A FEW minutes were all that was necessary to make Patrick Crolly understand that his work was only half done, so long as Cecilia-to him an utterly unknown being--had no other protection than that which he and Biddy could afford her. He surmised that her perse- cutors would not leave the ground satisfied without a reasonable search to find their prey. No sooner had these thoughts crossed his mind than Cecilia became restored to consciousness. "Where am I?" were her first words, as she essayed to rise, but possessing at the same time some undefined feeling-of security as she observed a female near to her. At this moment, Biddy caught Patrick by, the arm, and directed his attention to the forms of two men then approaching directly to the spot where she and her companions stood. "There are only two," said Patrick, as if speaking to himself. "Why, that's all, sir," replied Biddy, " an' sure's goodness, I can do for one o' them, an' you can do for the other." Cecilia heard these remarks; and, dreading a repeti- K    .  ..s          ....,   tion of her sufferings, fell on her knees and besought the continued protection of Patrick and Biddy. "Fear not, lady," was Patrick Crolly's assurance. "It was God's finger directed me to your assistance. If these men whom we see approach us belong to the party of villains who have treated you so infamously, depend upon it they shall find in the arm of Patrick Crolly a sufficient match for the pair of them." "Patrick Crolly!" slowly repeated Cecilia, in a low tone, as if something of a singular nature had just then crossed her mind, and drove all ideas of her sad condi- tion and her late sufferings out of her head. Patrick heard her; but, as the two men were drawing near, his mind became absorbed in their movements, although he felt inclined just then to question Cecilia on the reason of the strange manner in which she pro- nounced his name. "A fine night, Boss," said one of the men, while in the act of passing. There was no reply. "I say, old fellow, is that a young "un or an old 'un beside you there?" asked the other. "Ould or young, you'll find her a match for your bad manners," roared out Biddy, making a forward move- ment at the moment she spoke, as if with the intention of approaching the two men, but, in reality, to s(reen Cecilia, who had meantime crouched down behind her protectors. "Did any of you see a young lady pass this way a minute or two ago?" was the next question, and poor Cecilia's heart began to palpitate at the sound of the ruffian, Buzzard's voice, as if her life would ebb out. "No lady passed this way," said Crolly, in a tone of voice that made Buzzard quake. Come along," said the latter to his companion: and both walked quietly away, much to the satisfaction of   &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7146-00000050"/> 78      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Biddy, who, with all her warlike demonstrations, felt relieved at the absence of " them devils!" "We are now safe from all further annoyance, young lady," said Patrick Crolly, turning to Cecilia.; And if your residence be near at hand, I shall gladly accom- pany you, if you so desire it; or, if you wish, this good creature beside me will likely come along with us, and leave her little market stores behind her." "Oh, that light!" said Cecilia, in a tone of absolute weakness, and pointing towards the Convent. "Ah I yes; to be sure," added Biddy, at once com- prehending the young woman's meaning. "Let us try over beyant there, and sure they'll only be too glad to admit the dear creatur." "What place is that?" asked Patrick Crotly. "Why, the good Convent of Mount Benedict, to be sure," was Biddy's instant reply. '"Let us hasten-there-there!" said Cecilia, and she pointed with her trembling hand to the place indicated by Biddy. Patrick Crolly took Cecilia gently by the arm, and Biddy also rendered assistance,-saymg as she did so, ' Them fruit can remain there, an' I'm just as sure as I'm a livin' woman, this good night, not a sowl will harm them 'till I get back. An' sure if I never see 'em again, what matter; it's a good work in which I'm engaged." A few minutes only were necessary to bring our party to the back entrance of the Convent, where, in obedience to a call, a lay Sister presented herself to learn what was wanted. A short explanation sufficed; and after being shown Into a calling room, the lay Sister disappeared. She had been absent over ten minutes, and Cecilia was getting worse. The weakness consequent on the awful excitement she had just passed through, rendered her deadly pale, and just as she had faintly gasped out   THE VIOTATMFO TOMB.       79 the word "water," the Mother Superior, attended by two nuns, entered the room. "My dear Miss Morton," said the Mother Superior, tenderly embracing Cecilia, "' what is this that has hap- pened? Speak, child, speak!" But Cecilia was unable to reply. "Sure, she's just murdered, that's what she is," cried out Biddy, after telling one of the nuns to hurry for some water. Kind treatment soon restored Cecilia sufficiently to enable her to satisfy the anxious inquiries concerning her. After duly thanking her protectors and insisting on seeing them soon, Cecilia was gently removed. Pat- rick Crolly and Biddy were warmly thanked by the Sisters, and when Biddy was rewarded with a "God bless you, my good, honest woman," thel tears sprang into her eyes, and she was unable to speak, even one word. Her kind heart was too full. Patrick Crolly, with the air of a true gentleman, politely bowed his head and said nothing. His heart, also, was too full for speech; but the causes were widely different in his case and Biddy's. He had heard the sweet name of his sister pronounced, and although he did not believe that it could have the remotest reference to Kate, yet the sound of her name, pronounced by a stranger's lips, affected him wonderfully, and recalled memories that were painful to him. He had long believed that Kate was dead. He had no reason other than his own imagination, which was partly deranged with love of Kate, to harbor such a thought in his breast. But, after the thought had taken possession of his mind, he did not try to combat it, and so the feeling that she was really dead seemed to grow upon him, and that was how he came to believe it. For the short distance which lay from the Convent to  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7146-00000051"/> 80      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR.            ' where Biddy's fruit store was partly concealed, neither Patrick Crolly nor she exchanged a word. Both were thinking on matters widely, apart, and cared not for con- versation. The night was now advancing, but the moon shone so brilliantly that objects could be seen at a considerable distance, unless when within the influence of the great black shadows of the trees. "There now, glory be to God, them fruit's all safe!" was Biddy's exclamation; t"I knew they would be, for wern't we engaged in the holy work of helpin' the afflicted, an' sure that never goes without 'its reward somehow," she added. Patrick Crolly was glad to hear such expressions from Biddy, and told her so. He insisted on continuing his help, but only got leave to do so under restrictions, that he would not put himself to any great inconvenience. He promised all that was necessary, and when taking leave of Biddy had to do so very hurriedly, for the good fellow slipped something into her hand as valuable at least as the burden of apples he had assisted her in car- rying, and Biddy was about to return her thanks, but observing her companion take a hurried departure, changed her thoughts into prayers for her manly bene- factor. Patrick Crolly, being then tired and somewhat flur- ried, made his way to a hotel, but sleep. that night had few charms for him. New interests had been awakened n his breast, and he choose rather to allow his thoughts to have full play than offer any serious check to their current, although the scenes they recalled to his mind were as oftentimes painful as pleasant.     CHAPTER XIsI. SCENES AFTER THE ABDUCTION - REVELATIONS OF INTEREST. O1 O comfort-killing night-image of bell I Dim register and notary of shame! Black stage for tragedies and murders fell I Vast sin-concealing chaos I nurse of blame I  THE terror of that night, when Cecilia Morton was forcibly taken from her uncle's house, may be imagined by some people to have been of the most intense and terrible description. It had that appearance, certainly, for her aunt screamed and shrieked hysterically for up- wards of an hour. Mr. Alvah Morton, too, exhibited quite a frantic character, but there were intervals when it would have appeared as if he and his wife were act- ing a part, more than betraying such sorrow, and such exertion too, as the nature of the crime just committed would naturally lead us to expect. Alvah Morton, junior, and Kate Crolly were the only real sufferers for what had occurred. Poor Kate was no sooner out of one death-like swoon than she fell into another, and, strange as it may seem, Mrs. Morton appeared to care for Kate much more than that lady's antecedents would have guaranteed. She was anxious and fussy in her attentions, and assured Kate that no one attached any blame to her for what had happened. "We all know, my good young woman, that you had nothing to do with this sad business. Oh I nothing, whatever. We could not hold you accountable for the    &#xD;<pb n="82" xml:id="VAC7146-00000052"/> 82      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, disappearance of our niece.

O! so very bad! but we never could believe that our niece's companion had anything to do in betraying her-that is in allowing -helping, I mean-'in helping to a piece of the dreadful- est villainy that ever was perpetrated in a Christian family." Kate Crolly listened as well as she was able, and en- deavored to comprehend the assurances given by Mrs. Morton, but scarcely succeeded in that task. "Now, do you feel any better?" asked Mrs. Morton, in a condescending tone, and with as much good grace as she was able to command. "A little," was the faint reply. "Only a little. O! I'm really so sorry!" Kate told something like a white lie, in saying she was a little better; she was a great deal worse, and would have given much just then not to be tormented by her old persecutor. Not that she had the remotest thought of anger in consequence of the mental and bod- ily pain she had endured so often at the hands and tongue of her then would-be benefactor, but that she wished and required peace. Her senses were almost paralyzed by the scenes she had passed through, and she was utterly unable to comprehend the nature of the language, or the character of the lady who addressed her. "Never fear, Miss-Miss Crolly-excuse me," con- tinued Mrs. Morton; "although our niece is- oh Heaven only can tell-so far, far removed from us by this timne-that is, notwithstanding all the afflictions we have borne this night-welcome be the hand that strikes, when the blow comes from Jehovah.

The gentle persuasion of Mr. Morton next came into requisition, in order to hasten the departure of his wife from Kate's room. "Just one moment longer, dear," replied the lady, till I ask Miss-Miss Crolly a question concerning- concerning our dear niece. Do you think, Miss, that it is possible-oh, my crushed heart, it will break, I am sure!-do you think it possible that, by any means, our niece-oh, dear, the very thought will kill me!--could have been kidnapped-that is, taken away, and placed in-in that woman's place, you know?." "Come, my dear, you are only distressing Miss Crolly, don't you see, and injuring yourself by conjuring up strange thoughts which will cause you to be ill. Come, come away," and the lady's spouse took her gently by the arm-said arm receiving a secret but sudden jerk, which meant something. "Allow me to receive a reply from Miss Crolly," said Mrs. Morton, as she pulled her arm out of her husband's hand. "Impossible, madam!" was the brief reply of Kate, who betrayed a sickening restlessness during the inter- rogatories of the lady, whose absence she so much desired. "I am satisfied-now lead me away; quick, or my heart will burst!" uttered the troubled lady, as she reached her hands to her head and endeavored to appear really heart-broken.

Nevertheless, she felt that her strength would be increased by being left alone, eithler to think or sleep, as the case might be. Tired nature gave her a short repose. "You have spoiled this business, just as sure as my name's Alvah Morton," was the sharp reprimand given to the late broken-hearted lady. "Of course, dear. But it so happens that your name ain't Alvah Morton; and, therefore, I ain't spoiled this business." "What on earth made you-made you talk about your kidnappin' into the Convent, when you knew-" "There, dear, hush! Your tongue is as long as the ears that walls are supposed to possess." "Oh, botheration! that girl, who is frightened out of her wits, poor thing, can't hear me from here." Poor thing, indeed!

"A lie-a double lie-a thousand lies!" broke in Mr. Morton, whose face was swollen with rage and passion. "I am no liar, sir, but a truthful Christian woman.

But that is your own business, not mine-not mine, remember!" and, with this parting salute, the amiable Mrs. Morton closed her hand, which gave it quite the resemblance of a great fist, which she continued to shake at her hus- band's face until she retired from the room in which the late dialogue had occurred. Alvah Morton sank into a chair, overcome with the combined feelings of remorse and anger.

Of all those present none gave Buzzard such unmer- ciful trouble as Harry Buck. That individual had some sort of knowledge that Buzzard's fervency in the evil work in which these worthies had been engaged, arose from something deeper than the mere trifling reward promised to the villains who had forgotten whatever spark of manhood remained in their hearts when they attempted the perpetration of a terrible evil on an in-   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       87 nocent child who never harmed them even in thought, and who, with all her waywardnc would have almost died to have been the means of dc one or all of them a good turn.

If Buzzard had known this state of mind on the part of his friend Buck, it is more than probable that he would have preserved a more decent exterior than he did on this occasion. "Leave Buzzard's hump and wound alone,"'? he cried out. "If I choose to be a target for the purpose of benefitting my old friends, I am quite satisfied." "Go it, old Buz," cried out Keeley.

"An course not," replied Keeley, with something worse than a sinister look in his dull lighted eyes. "Buzzard's our boy, and here's to Buzzard. Long may he live to cheat the hangman." A low gurgling sound of " hear, hear," followed the rather uncomplimentary remarks of Keeley, while the speaker exhibited a strange aspect in his manner, which plainly conveyed to Buzzard's mind that he did not care a straw if his companion's head was even then enclosed in the hangman's noose. Craze looked at Keeley as much as to say, " p'raps your own might get the benefit first."

For a few minutes there appeared a kind of mutual understanding between Craze and Buzzard in conse- quenbe of this feeling,-nay more, there appeared sud- denly to have sprung up a mutual good feeling between this pair of as consummate scoundrels as ever cursed that part of the earth in which they moved. "Let's have the drinks again," roared out Buzzard. "The chinks as I got from the old woman will stand them, and more. Hear it now, Mr,-Hazry Buck-and more, I have said, for no one can yet say that while John Buzzard had a cent in his pocket that he was either afraid or ashamed of producing it."- "That's good," cried out Harry Buck, glad of the ef- fort made by Buzzard to change the thoughts of those present into a particular channel where strong drink was concerned. The liquor flowed for over an hour, and soon begati to produce its natural effect. None watched this with more earnest anxiety than Buzzard himself, who at times made his conduct in this respect too visible for the com- fort of his companions, who thought they observed in him a vigilance unusual in regard to the amount of liquor he swallowed. Buzzard observed this appearance in them, and, with- out inclining to notice it, drank glass after glass of the stupifying stuff before him, and soon appeared as if suddenly overtaken by its effects. "Of course Buzzard can-can stand-stand-yes, of course he can," drawled out Keeley. Buzzard made an attempt at snoring, but this only   created a laugh, which awoke the others from their state . of semi-unconsciousness. "Stand-why certainly-certainly," said the amiable  villain, Buzzard, who attempted to rise to his feet but suddenly collapsed and fell backward, as it too drunk to maintain a perpendicular position. His companions looked as if they enjoyed the effort of Buzzard, especially as they believed him incapable of comprehending the meaning of the remark made by Rat Keeley.                        1 "No man can-can-stit-stand-half (hie) qua- quart-er, so well-(hie) as Buzz-z-z-ard," sang out Craze in a thoroughly drunken tone of voice, that was horrible to listen to. "He's a brick-no-no-he ain't a-a brick-but abrick-a brickmaker," said the speaker, with a laugh that was frightful to hear or to behold, for the face of the besotted villain just then presented an appearance so repulsive as to startle even the drunken, hardened villains who sat beside him. "True, quite true," sang out the Rat of the company, "and he can cut Cutter out of a dollar as neatly as the  t  best of us." Buzzard's bad temper began to exhibit itself at the  . last remark of Keeley, but he instantly suppressed it. All around him were, in the course of a few minutes af- terwards, deeply buried in a drunken sleep. This was the result most desired by Buzzard, and the very thing he wished most to obtain. He dreaded a lengthened     ' conversation on the result of that night's work, and es- pecially as he saw indications on the face of Harry Buck which betokened something worse than a common    1 row. Rising cautiously from his seat he proceeded outside the door, and was-glad to be relieved of the oppressive heat and stench of the den he had lately occupied. Without any particular thought as to his after mode of    &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7146-00000058"/> procedure, he wandered a few yards from the door, when, to his infinite surprise and disgust, he felt himself suddenly caught by the arm. The uncertain light of the moon did not enable him to discern by what means he was thus so suddenly caught. His first impulse was that some friend of the injured Cecilia Morton had tracked him to his den, and awaited an opportunity of taking summary vengeance on him tor his conduct in the late diabolical proceedings. A short interval sufficed to dispel his fears on this head. What a nice business you have made of this affair to-night!" were the words that first struck upon his ear, and caused him to regain some strength. "Eh, Bill, is it only you? I thought it was the devil, or something worse, the way you gripped my wounded arm.' "Your wounded arm, Jack!" said his brother, Cap- tain William Buzzard, a special friend of Alvah Morton's, and a gentleman in a gentleman's pay and interest. "Yes, wounded, Bill, but not too badly to fdllow vp yonr game, should I see it again." "Of course you can, old fellow; for, may I never splice a brace, if I ain't the most darned, cussed spotter in all creation, and I'm the cuss for spotting for you. What do you think?" he inquired, in as soft a tone of voice as he could then readily assume. What do I think? Why, I thinks as the game's all up. The girl's gone, we're here, and that's the end of the cussed bizziness." "Don't be so tarnal sure, Jack, my boy," replied the skipper. "I warn'tidle to-night. I hurried down from port, after leaving instructions with the men, and was just in time to witness your success, and your Con- founded altercations afterward." "The devil you did   was Jack's reply, astounded at the disclosure then made by his brother.   "Aye! but listen I warn't like you, Jack; I kept my eye on the flying bird, and know her nest. D'ye hear me now?" -"No; I don' hear. I'm deaf with astonishment. But tell me, Bill, have you got the gal down in the ship?" What cricket's around hear?" asked Bill. with evi- dent alarm, as he heard the sound of a drunken man come bang against a door. If Jack Buzzard was deaf with astonishment before this occurrence, he was then wide awake, both with eyes and ears. He was quick enough to catch a glance of the retreating figure. Harry Buck, who had evidently been listening, and had heard every word that had passed between himself and his brother. Here was a dilemma, but how was it to be rectified? Jack was equal to the occasion. "Glad to hear it, ole boy-where's the the nest. then? Speak quick, for our brave fellows who joined me in this business on Morton's account are inside here. and will be rejoiced to hear anything of our lost bird." As Jack Buzzard was engaged in' the hurried repetition of these words, he caught his brother by the arm. and by sundry pinches convinced that worthy that they had been overheard, and that the better plan just then was to make a clean breast of the whole business, and allow Biuck, Keeley- and Craze to hear what was transpiring. "SHE'S IN THE CONVENT AT MOUNT 'DICT!" roared out Bill Buzzard, at the top of his voice, saying which he received a gentle reminder firom his brother, by way of a push, to- make tracks lest he should be called upon for further intormation .

"Through wood and mountain passes The winds, like anthems roll, They are chanting solemn Masses, Singing, ' Pray for this poor soul,' Pray-Pray!" NEXT morning, Sister Mary Bernard, the Mother Superior of the Convent, hastened to Cecilia Morton's bed-chamber, anxious to find out for herself how the poor, dear young lady had spent the night. Cecilia was much recovered, and to her evident surprise learned that the lady who appeared before her had little, if 'any particular knowledge of the outrage that had bien com- mitted the night previous. When Sister Mary Bernard had learned the partieu-  lars from'Cecilia's own lips she knelt down by the bed-  side, and in a voice visibly affected, offered thanks to God for the protection so providentially manifested in   a Cecilia's regard. Cecilia's eyes were bedewed with tears as she beheld such affectionate interest displayed by the good lady beside her. Never, perhaps, in her life before had she such cause. for thankfulness, and for the care she had so kindly be- stowed upon her. She had been used during life to a very different order of treatment in her uncle's house, at least so far as real kindness or womanly affection wyre concerned. True, she was not allowed to want for   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       93 anything, but then she was aware that it was the interest which had accumulated on hter own fortune, and not the money of uncle or auint, which supplied her tastes and necessities. Cecilia felt just then what a changed sort of being she  would have been had she been ulse( to such womanly tenderness as was shown to her by the Nuns of Mount Benedict, who, nearly one and all. having learned something about that strange young lady, came in turn, as their duties permitted. to sympathize with herand express their sorrow for her sufferings, and their joy at her release from the terrible evils which had been per- petrated upon her. ' Each kind word and kinder salutation found a dis- tinct place in Cecilia's heart, and, by the holr influence which manifested itself so beautifully in her regard. her thoughts rose to heaven with a warmth of thankfulness such as she had never experienced in the whole course of her life. At first Cecilia could scarcely account for this change in herself. She remembered, and not without a feeling or sense of penitence, how, on a former occasion, she disliked that Convent and all in it and around it, except the divine music that had so enraptured her soul on the occasion of her visit with Kate Crolly to Vespers. Again and again did Cecilia pass these things in re- view through her mind; and the more she dwelt upon them, the stronger came the feeling of desire upon her to make known her dispositions to the Lady Superior or to Sister Mary John, whom she had just then learned to be the lady who presided in choir at Vespers, and to whose unremitting toil, the high character for music which the Convent had obtained was owing. Besides, Sister Mary John had been most frequently with her that morning, and had brought heXr some tea and wine and other little delicacies, and had paid her ! ,    &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7146-00000060"/> H4    MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, such devoted attentions that she felt more intimately disposed towards her than to any other of the good Sis- ters, save, perhaps, the Mother Superior, and even that itself was doubtful. Sister Mary John had a most angelic appearance.    There was a strangeness about her, however, at times - for which Cecilia could not well account, and especially : if she drew any comparison between that nun and any of the others. "Oh. dear sister," said Ceceilia, addressing Sister Mary John, "how I do envy your almost divine happ i- ness in this heaven on earth. What would I not give to be like you, and to live here forever in peace and con- tentment; but then I am not like any of you. Ah, no! Poor Cecilia Morton is an Episcopalian Methodist, and such happiness can never be mine." "I hope, dear child, that God and our blessed Lady may vouchsafe to you the graces of a Christian child, and that He may continue them to you with the grace of perseverance ever after." "But I am a Christian, dear Sister." hurriedly replied Cecilia, as if to remove a wrong impression. Yes, yes; no doubt, ch'ld, according to your own fancy-or, excuse me, according-wel; yes, dear, you are a Christian of the Episcopalian Methodists." "But why did you pray for me, first to God, and then to the lady who has just gone out from here." "Oh, dear, pardon me, I did nothing of the kind. You mistake me, my pet. The word 'Lady' means our Blessed Mother."  "And is not she your Blessed Mother?" "Ah, no, dear girl! Madame St. George, or, as we commonly call her, Sister Mary Bernard, and oftentimes Reverend Mother, is but one of ourselves, selected, for her many good qualities, to exercise the duties of ai spiritual Mother over us, her children; but the lady    i ,      +   .      .  .   whom  I asked to grant you grades, is God's own Mother." "But, Sister, I don't like-" H4 ush, child I You are too weak to converse much, and I believe that I am myself guilty in allowing you to talk .ust now." "Pardon me, Sister (oh, how I love to call you by that sweet name!) I did not intend to speak so much, but find- ing you-you-so very kind, so thoughtful in all things tomrnnag -m, I thought--: and 06eiia covered her eyes with her pale white hands, as if she had been guilty of some grave indiscretion, and thereby gave mental trouble to her kind visitor. s "God bless you, child-" "Sister Mary John I " "Your commands, Mother." "Miss Morton is excited, and yet so poorly." "Pardon me, Mother; I retire," humbly replied the good Sister to her superior, who had then entered the room occupied by Ceoilia. 1 You must be provident of your returning strength, Miss Morton. I called just now to know your mind as to how we should act in giving information to your rela- tives concerning your safety. Can you direct me, Ce- cilia?" "Yes, madame," whispered Cecilia; "but please do not do or say anything regarding me for the present. I mean, for a little time, dear Mother." Sister Mary Bernard was much pleased with the can- dor of Cecilia, and with the exceedingly affectionate tone of voice in which she spoke. "1 I shall not trouble you, then, any more, just now," said the lady Superior. "Content yourself, Cecilia, and may our Divine Lord and his Blessed Mother have you in safe keeping.

God bless you - say- ing which, Sister Mary Bernard retired, closing the door after her as softly as if she had just left the sleeping apartment of a child. Cecilia, thus left to her own reflections, began to re- view her life, and to make it a study. Her mind was in a happy and peaceful mood, and a few minutes after she had begun to arrange her thoughts, a dreaminess came over her, and almost instantly she fell asleep.    THE VIOLATED TOMB.       97 CHAPTER XVI. CECILIA'S DREAM. "Down the broad Vale of Tears afar I The spectral camp is fled; Faith shineth as a morning stai - Our ghastly fears are dead." As she afterwards expressed it to her dear friend, the Lady Superior, Cecilia thought that she had been walk- ing in a beautiful garden, but could not see its termina- tion. She looked around on every side, and discerned nothing, save the same boundless plain of trees and flowers. Her heart fluttered with a new and indiscrib- able delight, which she had never experienced before, and which, at times, became almost painful to endure, in consequence of its overpowering beauty. The songs of invisible birds filled her ears with heavenly music the odors of the flowers filled the air with incense, the trees had a wavy motion which gave them an appear- ance as if under the influence of a soft, sweeping zephyr. Everything was calculated to move the heart with supernatural ecstasy. Clear rivulets ran here and there through banks of flowers, and the charm of the sounding waters was communicated to the lovely songsters among the flowery sprays. Suddenly a black cloud descended over the bright scene. Lower it came, and lower, until it seemed, in some places, to touch the beautiful earth. Cecilia stopped a moment or two, and with both hands pressed to her temples appeared as if endeavoring 7  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7146-00000062"/> 98      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, either to suppress the thoughts then crowding on her mind; or, to recollect more distinctly the scenes that appeared in her dream. "Yes; I remembered now," she exclaimed, with the pallor of death spread over her face. "The clouds came down, down, until they touched my head. I thought I should have fallen into a swoon, and the thought that all the beauty I had lately witnessed being about to vanish, and no one near me in the midst of the terrible darkness then gathering thick and fast around me, made me tremble with fear and dread. I wished to die-to become unconscious-but of no use was such desire. Every sense seemed doubly alive, and then I thought that I was somehow compelled to bear the heavy burden increasing on me for all the intense pleasure and delight I had experienced before. The heavy masses of clouds increased in weight and darkness. I spread out my arms as if I had the power to fly from the terror of that scene of desolation, and the sense of knowledge which I possessed, and the be- lief that I should witness, even against my will, the climax of the evils surrounding me, rendered me more abject and miserable than it is given to a mortal to de- scribe. Quick as thought there came the report of heaven's loud artillery right over my head; then a deluge of rain! The lightning spread over the whole horizon making the scene of desolation vivid and startling. I reeled and staggered from side to side, forward and backward, as if the earth should open and- swallow me. Finally, I permitted myself to fall, and then came crashing, peal after peal, as if the heaven's themselves were shaken asunder. I became uncon- scious, and remained so-how long I cannot tell. , When awaking, a strange sense of relief came to my aid! The heavens were bright and clear-no, not even a cloudlet could be seen. Around me was a waste. The ground   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       99 on which ae  lay was wet and barren. Far beyond me not. In my nervous anxiety to cross the running waters which separated me from the enchanted ground, I looked around, and to my right I beheld my com panion, Kate Crolly." "Kate Crolly, did you say?" The same, Madare. ' Come with me,' said Kate, 'and I shall lead you gently, Ceciia, from this Katepoor, barren waste.'To where?' I cried out with m mental anguish. 'To the pleasant places of floi$$,' and streams and trees, she replied. ' Quick; let us glo, I answered--and with the effort to arise, I awoke." "Your' mind, my child, was'sadly disturbed in conse- quence of your sufferings. IRest will soon restore you," said the Mother Superior, as she placed her soft white hand on the brow of the poor, wounded sufferer. Ah, yes, mother-,.madam, I should have said; but what of Kate Crolly? My dream. Oh, such a dream!" "Your sweet little friend, Kate, has been here to see you, but, by my advice, she refrained." "Then Kate knew all about--." "O, dear. Remain still and quiet. She learned early this morning an account of all that has taken place., "From whom, and by what means?", eagerly inquired Cecilia, while a flush of fever-red overspread her face. The kind old woman who assisted you in coming here." Crolly-and gave her a true history of all that occurred. at least, as far as she was able to give it." "Then may aunt and uncle know my whereabouts, said Cecilia, with a dejected air.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7146-00000063"/> t100     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, INo, I think not. Biddy-that is the old woman's name-saw Miss Crolly just as she left your uncle's door, when about to go to Mass. She waited till Miss Crolly was some distance forward, and then approached her with the news concerning you." "Did she return?" eagerly inquired Cecilia. "No; she hastened here after being present at Mass, and was most anxious to see you. The tears streamed from her eyes when she entered; and, when I informed her that you were asleep, and required rest, she retired, praying God that you would soon be all right." Dear, dear Kate. What pain she must have suffered! How I should like to embrace her!" "And you shall, dear child, at the proper time. I leave you now, Miss Morton, and pray you, like a good, loving, kind creature as you are, to remain contented for a little longer, and then you will be able, I hope, to see your friends, and return thanks for the many blessings vouchsafed to you."7 Saying which, Sister Mary Bernard retired, to perform some of the many and laborious duties consequent upon the responsible position which she held. Cecilia felt much stronger, and essayed to rise. The task was too much for her, and, as she already began to realize the sweetness of obedience, she remained still; and, for the first time in her life, offered up a prayer of thankfulness to the "' Comfortress ofthe Affited." She no longer felt inclined to smile at the devotion of Kate Crolly; on the contrary, she thanked God that He had sent her such a sweet creature to be a guide and directress to her in her many wayward moods. "And, oh! I I never deserved this great kindness this almost miraculous intervention in my behalf," she in- wardly ejaculated. "How many times in private have I not sneered at Kate's earnest devotion and thought her worse than a fool, although I did not say so. How   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       101 oft and again have I indulged in merriment at her ' su- perstitions,' and, above all,at the language she used when speaking of those lovely creatures whose hospitality and care I have experienced!" and Cecilia Morton fell into a train of thought--THE PRECURSOR OF HER AD- MSSION INTO A STATE OF GRACE! It is an unwarrantable practice, generally speaking, for an author to diverge from the plain path of his duty either by reflections or sermonizing. Whatever lessons he has got to inculcate, should be spoken by the charac- ters in his work. Their speech, and not his own, should come before the reader. With this knowledge plainly before me I desire to break through the conventional rule, and, at the expense of adverse criticism, venture on the expression of a few thoughts relative to the effect and example cf companionship. Kate Crolly and Cecilia Morton are no mythical char- acters. They lived and had their being just as they have been described, and it matters little whether their names have been correctly given in this story or otherwise. Kate Crolly's character was no accident. It was not born with her; rather was it the result of severe train- ing, and a devotion to virtue for virtue's sake. Here now is a point for sceptics and fools to grapple with. That young lady's character was the result of con- stant prayer and vigilance, and these, be it forever un- derstood and remembered, arose from the poverty ot the girl! The poor-that is, the good poor, as distinct from the viciously inclined-have more than mere poverty to contend against. Their situation in life inclines them towards vice and as a refuge against their temptations they have r4ourse to prayer and watchfulness. Where these are honestly performed, they become Christ's best guardians of virtue on earth. They are good and vir.  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7146-00000064"/> 102      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, tuous for sake of goodness and virtue, and wherever they come into contact with those who are able to ap- preciate such things, the value of the example of their lives becomes incalculable. Kate Crolly was one of this rare class of special beings, whose life was but the re- flex of her own pure and virtuous heart. That heart had been taught by suffering to suffer and be patient. To look into her deep, thoughtful, and most beautiful eyes, one would have imagined that it was quite natural for Kate Crolly to be all that she appeared. She was tender looking, soft-hearted, and inexpressibly beauti- ful, owing to the sweet order of her life. But it was no more natural for that girl to be and to appear to be what she was, than for the veriest outcast of society to -be natural in the worst order of life. Kate Crolly had to rise above nature before she became all that she was-not what she desired to be-for she aspired after divine perfection. Her phys- ical and mental suffering in the presence of Cecilia's aunt was none the less acute because she did not resent tie insults offered her. The tameness of her disposi- tion did not arise, as many in the world would imagine, from lack of spirit or courage; or, from want of a per- fect consciousness of wrong. Not from any of these, but from the knowledge that those who are not called upon to suffer, are almost worthless, either to them- selves or others, arose the splendor of the almost per- fected nature of this girl. The world could not behold these heavenly virtues which enriched the soul of Kate. They were studiously concealed from the gaze of the world-that is. the general world--but their effects were visible enough in the life of their possessor, and, as far as the example bf that life went, it was priceless beyond measure. With such people as the renegade Morton and his Puritanical spouse. whose natures had nothing what-   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       103 ever of the spiritual in them, the beauty of Kate Crolly's life was not only non-effectual,' but was positively hateful. There, indeed, Kate's presence did no good; neither would the presence of St. Paul have been of any service in the same place. But Cecilia Morton was widely different in her dis- position. She desired to be good for goodness' sake, and on that account looked on her companion, Kate, as a heavenly visitor, who permitted no opportunity to pass by without some profit. ,1  i   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7146-00000065"/> 104     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPTER XVII. A MEETING BETWEEN THE BUZZARDS AND CRAZE-' FURTHER PLANS LAID OUT FOR ANOTHER VILE AT- TEMPT ON CECILIA. "Villains I permitted for some wise end, To blast the love and kindness of a friend." CAPTAIN BUZZARD being aware of the whereabouts of Cecilia Morton used every effort, as privately as pos- sible, in conjunction with others, to see and have his evil ends in her regard accomplished. For that reason himself and brother kept prowling around the Convent at all hours, but especially at night time; for physical darkness and the evil dispositions of the minds of such men as the Buzzards have a relation- ship of some kind, the balance being always favorable to the former. Finding his efforts baulked at every step, he got out- rageously angry, and so did his brother Jack. Harry Buck contrived on two particular occasions to meet the Brothers Buzzard at most inopportune places, and at very inopportune hours. At such times, Buck had a singular habit of sticking his hands behind his back and twisting his head to the one side, would give a villainous glance or leer at Jack Buzzard and his brother, and in that position inquire what was the news? The continuance of this game on one occasion came nearly costing him his life. Captain Buzzard presented a pistol at his head, and challenged him to a repetition   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      105 of his conduct. Buck only smiled an innocent smile, behind which lay as much unadulterated villainy as it was possible to find encompassed in the characters of half a dozen common scoundrels. Neither William nor Jack Buzzard saw this, and, even if they did, they were not sufficiently comprehen- sive in brain-power to understand its meaning. Buck declared that he had a most important secret to communicate, but under no circumstances would he communicate it unless properly remunerated for his risk. "Certainly!? replied Captain Buzzard. "Why, certainly!" continued Jack Buzzard. "Say the word; but let it be fair,' repeated the Captain. "Yes, yes; say the figure-but it must be square," added the careful brother. Then bending over his head to his companions, in a hoarse whisper Buck informed them that for fifty dollars down in his palm, just on the spot, he would give such information as would make the fifty dollars appear like nothing. "It's done!" said the Captain, taking out a leathern wallet from his pocket and handing the money to Buck. Jack Buzzard watched the transaction closely, and appeared, by his looks at Henry Buck, as if he could have eaten him for naming so small a sum. Hie was a kind brother, was Jack Buzzard. TIad he got an opportunity he would have had little, if any, scruple in telling Buck to double the sum, and give him half. Having safely pocketed the money, and buttoned his coat, as much as to say, " you don't leave there without my knowledge, ' Harry Buck communicated the impor- tant intelligence that Cecilia Morton was secreted in the "  Nun's House " of Mount Benedict.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7146-00000066"/> 106     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Here was news to have paid fifty dollars for.' "You-don't-say!" was William Buzzard's slow but significant exclamation.  ' Accept the word of a man for it," replied Buck. A pause followed this disclosure, during which the gal- lant captain revolved in his mind his next course to pursue. It was at once evident to his mind that Harry Buck must have seen him and recognized him, on the grounds of Mount Benedict, during the attempted ab- duction. To hint to Buck that such was the case, and thus show to that scoundrel that he, Buzzard, was al- ready in possession of the information, would have been rather a dangerous course for him to follow, as it would prove cowardice on his part, and so he prudently pre- ferred to allow Buck to labor under the impression that the secret just disclosed was not only new but valuable. No one was more astonished at this course of con- duct than brother Jack. To that individual it was sim- ply inexplicable why something was not said or done under such circumstances. As it was, he stuck his large paws into his trowser's pockets and kept whistling an unknown tune, during which his mind was busy at work as to what would follow. "That's important, so it is, I tell you," said the Cap- tain. "'Portant, I say, is no word for it," nodded Jack, with a knowing wink, which implied, "don't be afraid of me, old boy, I know your dodge-when you say it's 'port- ant." i"I knew you would both say so," chuckled Buck, quite merrily at the success of his plans, but wondering, in quite a philosophical mood, how Buzzard could put up with the sell so nicely. It never struck the Captain that there was any other way by which Buck could have arrived at his informa- tion but the one suggested by himself, and so curiously   THE' VIOLATED TOMB.      107 astounded did he appear to be, that Buck began to fancy that his ears had deceived hkm. But Buck's ears were seldom deceptive to their owner, who had trained them for many years before he adopted them into his service, as faituful workers in their master's plots and counter- plots. After due rumination on this to Buck a matter of much importance, and especially as all three had re- marned quiet for a few minutes, Harry Buck sagely con- cluded that he was all right, and that his ears were as good as anybody's else, and he would swear by them, if necessary. "Now there's nothing easier than to go to that nun- nery and demand that girl," said the wise Captain, more by way of addressing himself than throwing out a sug- gestion to his brother and Buck. "The very thought as flashed like the light of a lan- tern over this child's mind," was Mr. Buck's response. "Damn him for a scoundrel, he has seen me, then!" was the interior ejaculation of the Captain, "that al- lusion to the lantern proves it." "Ain't there some quick plan, then, which us three could start to and work upon at once?" inquired Jack Buzzard. "As for me, Ifm just as ready as ever to 'gaoe on a decent bit of work, and what's better and decenter, I ain't a g0in' to put it on any heavier than just as Mr. Buzzard likes." "It would spoil the whole darned thing, if I were to be seen engaged in it," was the assurance of the Captain. "An sure it would," condescendingly replied Mr. Buck, who was delighted at the prospect of cowardice thus given by the Captain. John Buzzard was trying hard to understand friend Buck, but if he had tried from then till now, he could not have even partially succeeded.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7146-00000067"/> 108     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Mr. Buck was a much greater mystery to Blizzard than anything of the genus homo which that individual had ever encountered throughout life. This knowledge perplexed Jack Buzzard very much, and rendered him somewhat doubtful of any new scheme proposed to regain possession of Cecilia. Nay, more, it made it a matter for consideration on that individual's part as to the expediency of having anything additional to do in this " confounded bizziness." ' Let's take a look out for Craze," said Jack Buzzard. "He helped us before, and we may require his help again. Brother Bill don't want to appear to get mixed up in our work; and, after all he has done, we should not press him into it." "- Agreed-agreed," was the pleasant response of Mr. Buck, and to show his devotedness to his friends, he there and then proposed to " swallow " a portion of the money he had received in drinks. The night had turned cold, and as the three villains had walked into a known quarter where some depraved haunts were scattered around, they were not long in gratifying their desire for strong drink. Being seated at a deal table in a half-dark room, and having indulged pretty freely, it was arranged that Mr. Buck should depart on the friendly mission of inviting Mr. Craze. Buck did not altogether relish the idea of leaving the two Buzzards together,-while, on the other hand, he wished to have the first word with Craze. "An' course I'll go-do anything fair and square required of Henry Buck; and it's none other that says it, by G-!" and the valiant creature slapped his thigh with his hard palm, by way of confirmation and illustration. "Good-bravo!" shouted both brothers, amid which Buck sprang to his feet, and, tossing off half a tumbler of rum, darted off on his mission.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       109 CHAPTER XVil. MEETING BETWiEEN KATE AND CECILIA AT THE CON- VENT-BIDDY ON A SELF-IMPOSED MSSION. "Come, let me take thee to my breast, An' pledge we ne'er shall sunder; An' I shall spurn as vilest dust The world's wealth and grandeur." IF no other cause had existed to prove to Kate Crolly the heartlessness of the family with which she resided it was soon rendered visible to her by the want, or nearly so, of all honest effort, on their part, either to trace the whereabouts of Cecilia, or discover who were the ruffians that had thus outraged all law, and violated the sanctity of a citizen's home. When Kate had received permission from Madame, Mother Superior. to visit Cecilia, she thouglt her very heart would burst with joy. She laughed, or, rather, tried to laugh, but the effort was a poor one. Cecilia gave evidence of greater strength than her companion, and tried to banter her a little on 'her weakness. Several of the Sisters obtained permission to be present at the interview between Kate and Cecilia, and, by special permission, a few of the more advanced lady pupils. Among the latter was little Sister Marguerite, whom, it will be remembered, was spoken of in such terms of endearment by Biddy, the apple-woman. Several in the Convent had heard of a young lady being brought within its Walls for safety from a band of villains, but that was all that could be learned. Then  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7146-00000068"/> "O      MOUNT BBNEDICT; OR, it became known that the lady was the companion of Miss Crolly, a new acquaintance of at least some of the inmates. Many and kind were the inquiries as to the state of Cecilia's health, and every one of such inquiries reached the heart of poor Cecilia and awoke thoughts to which, but for Kate Crolly, she might always have been a stranger. "Oh! my heart will burst with the combined strength of my feelings-joy andgrief are trying for the mastery!" uttered Kate with choking emotion, as she embraced Cecilia with more than the warmth of a sister's affec- tion. i' To pray for blessings and not to know whether it is better that we should receive them or that they be withheld, makes us bend to the Divine Will; but to have our most earnest desires and blessings granted us in the fullest plenitude of Heaven's gracious kindness, almost before the heart has uttered them-that, oh! that is be- yond everything, and makes me this moment almost afraid to realize, or even to try to realize, the goodness and greatness of God." Kate's heart beat high with gratitude to God, but let. us also admit that Kate may have erred-just ever so little-in imagining that it was her prayers in behalf of Cecilia that were heard, and not those of Cecilia- her- self. The Mother Superior did not omit to notice this little exhibition on the part of Kate, but the wise Moth- er knew properly how to interpret all such beautiful manifestations of feeling. It was not exactly plain that Kate believed in the effi- cacy of her own prayers alone, although she accepted the fact of Cecilia's rescue as a direct intervention of God in proof of the power of prayer. "Not now alone, but always, dear Kate, have you, from the first moment I had the happiness of beholding your sweet face, remembered me in your orisons. I   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       1" often thought so before; now I feel it-I feel it, sweet girl," said Cecilia, while an impassioned glow over- spread her beautiful and intelligent face. "Oh! please, dear lady, accept this beautiful apple from me," said a youthful creature approaching Ce- cilia. "It will be so nice for you to eat. I know it will do you good, and you will like it. I got it from old Biddy, and she sells such beautiful apples-" "Och do, my good lady, just allow me for a few minutes, you know, to see the dear creature," said a voice at the door. "My good woman, I cannot, indeed, disobey my orders-" "But I have business with Mother Lady, an' so I must get to see her. You don't know it-" "You cannot obtain admission. Whatever message you have shall be taken to the Lady Superior, so there is no use insisting more." "Faith, an' I'll insist should I stay here the whole day, and lave all I have unpurtected to the wide world." "There-there! That's Biddy's voice," cried little "sister"Marguerite. I know it. Oh! she's come to see you," and the child clapped her hands with joy. "Let her be admitted," was the order of the Lady  Superior. Kate and Cecilia were so much engaged talking mat- ters in a soft, low tone, that they did not seem to com- prehend what 'was going on, although Cecilia, in the kindest manner possible, had received the present of fruit from Marguerite. In a minute, or less, Biddy was in the midst of the little party who surrounded Cecilia. She was altogeth- er flurried and'confused, looking first at Cecilia, then at Kate, and scarcely appeared to recognize either. "It's the Mother--the Lady, I want," said Biddy. "Oh'! here's our Mother," laughed out the child Mar-  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7146-00000069"/> "2      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, guerite. "Don't you know her, Biddy, Lady Sister Mary Bernard?" Biddy turned round and looking earnestly into the Lady Superior's face, eagerly asked permission for a private interview. This being readily granted, Biddy, without so much as a kind look even, to any of those around her, took her leave, accompanied by the Superior. Arrived at a small waiting room, and having satisfied herself that the door was properly closed and every- thing in due order as regarded privacy, Biddy, heed- less of the invitation to be seated, clasped her hands together and with upraised eyes exclaimed: "Oh, may the blessins of all the angels and saints surround this house to-night. Lady, dear, sure it's only two hours ago when who should I meet but old Ryan, the melon man, an' what does he say to me, but ' Good day, Bid,' that's what he always calls me, Madam-' Good day, Ned,' sez I, 'an' what's the news?' manin', Madame, anything about our little markets. ' It's the news your axin' about, is it,' sez he. ' In' course, the news, Ned, what's the price of the pippins in Boston? '" "But what of all this, my. good woman? I thought you had some business of importance with me," said Sister Mary Bernard, with particular dignity, which did all but upset honest-hearted Biddy, especially as the Lady rose to depart. Biddy was worse than confounded. She was thrown completely off her guard and stammered out something to the effect that she had something of importance to communicate, otherwise she would not have troubled her ladyship. * * Madame St. George, or, Sister Mary Bernard, as she was affectionately styled, was a truly dignified and commanding, lady. United to a well trained, scholarly mind, a pious, and well regulated heart and conscience, she possessed a will of   THE VIOLATED TOMB.        113 Sister Mary Bernard relented of her haste, but, as she had really important duties to discharge elsewhere, she merely intended that her visitor should be a little less singular firmness, which although unpleasant to those who re- quired restraint, was, nevertheless, an essential of special re- quirement in such an establishment as that of the Ursullne Convent at Mount Benedict. Behind this will, beat a soft and tender heart, which required the exercise of the will in no small degree to prevent that over demonstrativeness of affec- tion which in most cases pertains to those of Irish birth and lineage. Sister Mary Bernard (Grace O'Boyle) belonged, I be- lieve, to the latter class. She had received the greater part of her highly polished education on the continent of Europe, was a nripe scholar in modern languages, and in every way fit- ted to fill with special dignity the high office of Lady Superior in such an establishment as that of Mount Benedict, where her duties required her to superintend the Sisters who had received the Black Veil, as well as those whose novitiate had not yet permitted them to enter the advanced state. Besides these duties, the lady pupils of the establishment generally num- bered between seventy and eighty, together with teachers and servants for in-door and out-door work. Such a complication of duties of so extraordinary a character, surely required a- combination of the rarest qualities of Judgment in one on whose shoulders rested such grave responsibilities. Au these were found in the Lady Superior and sufficient proof of that fact was found in the endorsement of Sister Mary Bernard by the learned and pious Bishop Penwick. The Lady Superior was also known as Sister Mary AmI Ur- sula. To some it may appear unnecessary that the author of a Story should travel out of his legitimate domain in order to write in this strain of Sister Mary Bernard. The author is of a different opinion, and while he admires and oftentimes defers to the opinions and even prejudices ot others, he considers this step necessary, and at this stage of his Story, inasmuch as many erroneous opinions have been entertained concerning this celebrated lady, and that, too, by those from whom a different course might naturally have been expected. Had it been possible that Miss O'Boyle should have appeared as one of the leading or continued characters of this Story, then, indeed, all this would have been rendered unnecessary. 8  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7146-00000070"/> "4      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, redundant and round-about in imparting whatever she had to say. "Well; whatever you have to communicate I shall hear it," said the Lady Superior, in a more soothing tone to her half-scared visitor. "Yes, Madam, an' many thanks," whispered Biddy, perfectly restored to her former state of confidence, and, it may further be added, perfectly cured of her wander- ing statements. "He told me-that's Ned Ryan, you know-" "Yes, I know. Proceed." "--That in passing Cutter's field he heard four men- that's the truth, Madam-say one to the other, ' Damn it, we can burn down the whole nest in that Nunnery if we don't get her out,' that's, precisely the words they used, an' so without stoppin' even a, minit, Madam, I hurries along sayin' a pater an' ave now an' again to be in time an' to tell you's all here that Miss Cecilia may be the cause of the ruin of the place." "Did you learn nothing further?" inquired the Su- perior. "Oh! the divil a haporth-I mean, Madam-oh dear-" and here Biddy fairly broke down, and the tears streamed from her eyes. She felt she had been guilty then, indeed, all this would have been rendered unnecessary. But such is not the case, for the character of the lady only comes in at a point and in a place where but few words are given to her to speak. As to the character here laid down for Sister Mary Bernard, the Author has to state that after re- spectful applications to those who lived with this lady, he has been favored with the most complimentary sketches of her life, by those most competent to judge. Among others, the Author returns, thus publicly, his thanks and indebtedness to the good Nuns of Mount de Chantal, near Wheeling, West Vir- ginia, to whom he is also indebted for many facts regarding "The Mysterious Lady," confined at Mount Benedict Convent, and who was the innocent cause of the burning of that splen- did establishment.

You have been deceived somehow, but that matters nothing. The temporary residence of a young lady in this house can bring us no harm. She feels grateful for our kinds "Yes, ma'am." Too grateful, indeed, and I feel confident that you have been imposed upon-not designedly, remember- and I feel very thankful indeed for all the trouble you have taken." "Yes, ma'am, an' many thanks," were Biddy's last words. Once out of the Convent, Biddy gave vent to her feel- ings in a strain of anything except praise, while reflect- ing on the errand her feelings had carried her in conse- quence of the " bad information of that ould fool, Ned Ryan, the good-for-nothin' cratur, who doesn't know whether his head's a pippin or a melon."  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7146-00000071"/> "a      MOUNT BENEDICT; Ol, CHAPTER XIX, HARRY BUCK'S MSSION-AN INTERVIEW BETWMEEKN CAP- TAIN BUZZARD AND ALVAH MORTON. "Here Brewer Gabriel's fire extinct, And empty all his barrels; He's blest-if as he brew'd he drink, In upright honest morals." WHEN Mr. Harry Buck called upon his friend, Mr. Harry Craze, he found that gentlemanly specimen of creation engaged in a quiet conversation with another mutual friend, Mr. Rat Keeley. Mr. Buck's astonishment was not one bit greater than that of the other gentlemen. "Called on bizziness?" was the interrogatory of Mr. Craze. "- Of importance," added Mr. R. Keeley. "W-h-y, I g-ue-s-s i- i-s s-o-m-e-t-hi-n' o-f t-h-a-t e-r-e n-a-t-u-r-e," drawled out Mr. Henry Buck, as he eyed his boon companions. The droll appearance of the last speaker rather helped to ingratiate Mr. B. into the good graces of his fel- lows than otherwise. "How's old boy Buzzard?" inquired Mr. R. Keeley. "Aye, aye; what of old friend Buzzard?" added Craze. It ain't over half an hour since I saw him, and my par- ticular business with you-that is, Mr. Craze-is to say that our friend, OUR mutual friend, Mr. John Buzzard, would like to see you on that ere business."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       117 Harry Buck was glad of an opportunity of saying these words in presence of Keeley. He did not antici- pate the presence of the latter on his arrival, but he was none the less glad to find him there, for villainy was so deeply implanted ih the man's nature, that anything which tended to introduce ill-feeling among his com- panions, did him a positive good. Digression: I How many such like men are there in the world as this Buck? Villains of a decenter tpye there may be, that is, in appearance, but whose hearts are as equally cor- rupted and as bad. That is a problem that but few can solve. And yret, this class predominates in every circle of society. Go where we may, do as we think for the best, give our best sympathies to those whom we con- sider fit to redeem themselves, still the ugly fact stares us in the face, the old villainous remnant is still palpa- bly before us. So there are are many Mr. Harry Bucks in this world, and it is unfortunately only too probable that they will so remain to the end. At best, the most that can be done is to reduce their number and influence. Keeley did not feel over complimented at the allusion of particular friendship between Buck and Craze. On the contrary, he felt wounded at the tenderest point of his honor. "His honor," be it remembered-for such be- ings as the Buzzards, Craze, Buck, and Keeley, do ac- tually believe in "honor." Consequently, Rat Keeley was not half pleased at the very particular manner in which Mr. Buck introduced himself, on the matter of business to " friend "Craze. "And Mr. Buzzard requires our aid, eh?" drawled forth Mr. R. Keeley. "Yes, our aid," echoed Craze. "Not unless you wish to give it, gentlemen," was the polite answer of the messenger, Mr. Buck. Keeley and Craze looked at each other for a few mo-  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7146-00000072"/> "8     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, ments, as much as to say, what answer should we give, or should we give any answer at all. "I'll tell you what," said Keeley, as if suddenly struck by an inspiration of good; "tell Mr. Buzzard, that is, Jack Buzzard, our friend, to come this way himself, and give us a slight wrinkle of the new work in hand. If we can benefit him-never speaking of any benefit to our- selves-why, as in duty bound, we shall talk to him like a brother." "Yes, just like a brother," said Craze. "I'm perfectly willing, gentlemen, to do as you say," half whispered Harry Buck. "Of course, I'd have pre- ferred to-to-to-find Mr. Buzzard's friends ready and willing-mind what I have said-ready and willing to stand by him in his difficulties." "Certainly-why certainly," repeated Craze and Keeley, almost in the same breath. "Then let us agree to go in with him and help him along in his work," continued Buck with much earnest- ness. "No, not even for Buzzard. We're his men, if he chooses to act the part of a man himself," said Keeley, very emphatically. "Then I'm off to inform friend Buzzard," sneered Harry Buck. '"No you ain't anything of the kind, I assure you, old fellow," said a voice right behind the speaker. It was Jack Buzzard, himself, who had just then ap. peared. Fearing that Harry Buck might not be over-truthful on the business of his mission, Captain Buzzard pre- vailed upon his brother John to follow Harry lest the latter might be in some way remiss in the fulfilment of his duty. Captain Buzzard had a main eye to business, and, in- dependent of his infamous desire to succeed in the evil   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       119 work in which he was engaged, he desired his brother's absence lest he should be called upon to account for the non-performance of a certain work. He was not far astray in the latter conjecture: for, immediately after the departure of his brother Jack, he was waited upon by no less a personage than Mr. Alvah Morton himself. "I'm behind time," was the hasty remark of Mr. Mor- ton. "Not exactly behind time," replied Captain Buzzard. "My brother is just gone off,. sir, on a mission connected with our work." "Oh! hang your work!" was the half angry rejoin- der "Hang my work?" said the Captain. "Why I'm en- gaged in your work for the past fortnight, and hang me, as I deserve to be, but I'm getting tired of it. I have spent all my money and yours to boot, and here I am , as far from the accomplishment of your design and mine as the first moment I entered on the performance of the task you assigned me. -Not a moment's time have I lost, and yet, somehow or other, I am as far from the fulfilment of your instructions as I was the first mo- ment I undertook to carry off that niece of yours." This was anything but a, pleasant announcement to Mr. Morton. He had expected to heir other news from this man, William Buzzard. "  But the fault is not mine," said Mr. Morton. "Nor mine," answered Captain Buzzard. "Then whose could it be?" inquired Cecilia Morton's uncle. "The devil's," quietly sneered the Captain. "I don't know the person you allude to." "No, of course you don't; but everything in its time you know. You'll know him, and if I mistake not he'll know you when he sees you," rejoined Captain Buz-  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7146-00000073"/> 120      MOUNT BENEDICT; OI,  zard, with a heartless chuckle that pierced Morton to the very soul. "' Let us understand each other, Cap" said Morton, in a tone of voice that indicated pretty clearly how much the speaker was under the influence of the man he ad- dressed. "That's exactly the very thing I want," replied Wil- liam Buzzard. "Is the schooner still lying down in Boston Har- bor?' "The old sea-gull ' Fanny,' is as quiet as a babe at her moorings; the men sleep in their berths every night; and I only await a fair wind: then ho, for the South.. Cargo and all is ready, but the prettiest piece of furni- ture is wanting for the cabin, your--" "I know what you mean," despondingly whined the base guardian of his brother's child. "I have given you now over one thousand dollars, and, farther than failure, we have not arrived at anythin ." Capt. Buzzard knew that Morton knew he was telling a manifest lie. Nearly twice as much had been given at different intervals, but Morton believed that by mak- ing the price of his rascality appear as small as possi- ble that he would hereby gain greater favor in the eyes of the Captain. He falied in this, for Buzzard held a lower opinion of him than ever, in consequence of this very attempt. "Another thousand will scarcely suffice for finishing the job,1" quietly remarked the Captain of the "Fanny." "And another, I'm not fit to give." "Then all's up, and I shall proceed to sea." "I suppose we can make no better arrangement, then?" "None that I'm aware of." "But are you positively certain of the girl's where- abouts?" tremblingly inquired Mr. Morton, who began.   mTHE VIOLATED TOMB.          121 to doubt the truth of what he had heard, and was at the same time troubled with a sort of vague belief that Ceci- lia was then actually an inmate of the cabin of the "' Fanny." The assertion that the men slept every nightI In their berths gave cause to this doubt, and partly con. firmed him in his suspicions that Captain Buzzard was bent only on black-mailing. However, Alvah Morton had taken the first few steps in his villainous career, at the instigation of his wife, and it was now easier to pro- ceed than go back. Had the poor fool only known it, Captain Buzzard was not even the proprietor, nor master, of a rowing boat. The schooner "Fanny" was altogether a myth; but its alleged existence was necessary to the plot in which the Captain was engaged. "If I could feel assured that you know the hiding place of Cecilia, and that this business can be suc- cessfully managed, I would have no objection to the terms you ask," was the next concession of Morton, who began to pluck up heart a little, as visions of his scheme in becoming owner of his niece's fortune flashed through his half-crazed brain. "Her hiding place is known to me. The men are ready to go work again, but not without double pay this time; so, if you say another thousand down, consider the work done. I would not attempt it for such a trifle, mind you-for some of us may get our lives taken for our pains-but that I dearly love the girl, and desire to marry her." That was the villainous idea that filled the uncle's mind also. A marriage he thought would cover any scandal which the whole business might create, even should publicity attach thereto. That Captain Buzzard really intended to marry Cecilia, If he could by any possibility effect his diabolical pur- pose, can be easily understood, but not for the purpose  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7146-00000074"/> 122      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, of benefitting Morton, whom he believed to have a mer- cenary design in his evil course: but rather for the pur- pose of benefitting himself. Of course, the black- hearted villain had no love for the dear girl, but that mat- tered nothing. "I'll come down honestly, if you tell me where she is located," said Morton. "Impossible-I've told you so before-I cannot reveal that secret!" There was no use in further parley, and Buzzard inti- mated as much. For a few moments Morton was completely staggered. He felt himself deeper than ever in the net of villainy, A gleam of remorse shot through his conscience, but, had he waited to examine his new feeling, he would, have found, had he chosen to acknowledge as much to' himself, that fear was the genuine cause, and neither pity for his suffering niece, nor an honest desire to re- trace his evil steps, actuated him. It was rank fear and cowardice that took moment- ary possession of him. He was in the toils of villains, and could not see as to how he should break with them. The longer his connection with Captain Buzzard, the less foundation he had to rest upon. Just then he would have given all he possessed if he had never com- menced the career on which he had entered. Just so! Thus it is with all the rest of mankind. Without a thought as to the result to mind or body, reputation or cast, the evil doers of the world plunge recklessly into all sorts of crime, and if the promptings of a better nature make themselves felt for a moment, the admonition is crushed out of life, believing that it is of no use to go back-that matters are as bad as they can be-and so the devil triumphs! Well, I'm resolved!" said Morton.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      123 "That's right, old boy! Give us your hand for that," was the rejoinder of the Captain. "Wait till you hear my resolution! , "O! certainly! "Well: I'm resolved to wait a little time before we conclude this bargain." "O! with all my heart!" laughed Buzzard, with such a tone of voice that Alvah Morton actually trem- bled as he heard it. Good-by, for the present. I know where to see you again," said the conscience-stricken man. "One word before you go. I'm out of pocket con- siderable on my own account, and chiefly through love- mind you, love of the girl---and so you can't have any objection if I ask you to loan me a hunchded dollars. Mind you, it is only a loan!" Morton complied more willingly than was expected, and both parted.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7146-00000075"/> 124      MOUNT BENEDICT; ORB CHAI'TEll XX, A PAINFUL INTERVIEW AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN ALVAH MORTON AND HS WIFE. "Come, ye spirits, That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here; And fill me from the crown to the toe, top-fall Of direst cruelty." WHEN Alvah Morton returned to his own dwelling, his mind was anything but a heaven to its possessor. His better nature, if it did not return, or obtain permis- sion from him to return and assume its control, was, nevertheless, thoroughly awakened, and he felt its scourges on his unhappy soul most poignantly. In a few hours the fate of age seemed to have over- taken him. He was overwhelmed in misery, and at times was tempted to act the cowardly part of a suicide. Scarcely had he entered the door when he was met by his wife, who saw at the first glance that her unhappy husband had suffered great torture since he had left. "What has happened, my dear?" was the first question addressed to him, as if the tender heart of the wife had prompted it. "Nothing, my dear; nothing worth mentioning," was the reply, given in the bitterest manner the speaker could assume. "Alvah, you are cruel to address me thus!" "Who's cruel?"  "You, love 1" and Mrs. Morton, for the first time in many years, endeavored to caress her husband.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      125 "Hands off, woman-devil-or whatever you may be. I am cruel, the cruelest of the, cruel, and who made me so? Answer that, I say: who made me cruel?" "Get off, you old coward. I see what you are driving at. You have failed in your work, and you would revenge your failure on me. Ah! pity us, poor women, who have to stand the brunt of this wicked, wicked world, and deserted by our natural protectors, too. Oh! who is there to pity us!"Saying which, Mrs. Morton assumed an air of injured innocence, that completely upset her weak-minded husband; and banished from his mind, as completely as if the thought had never entered it, every disposition he lately possessed to stop in the middle of his mad and infanous career. "Excuse me, Eddy (this was his affectionate title for Edith). I have been unfortunate with that man, Cap- tain Buzzard. He knows where Cecilia 4s concealed, and will not tell me. He requires another thousand for the completion of his work, and I had to loan him a hundred dollars before I parted with him." "Heavens! who ever heard the like of this! Is there in all Charlestown an idiot, a dolt, equal to this fool of a husband? What's to be done, anyhow-anyhow?" Such were the, exclamations which greeted the ears of Alvah Morton. He attempted to rush from the room, but was prevented by his wife; who could assume a weakness and exercise a robust strength alternately, so as utterly to confound even Alvah himself, who had been joined to her for a period of over thirty years, and during which time he had often tried, and as often failed, to understand his Eddy. "What would you, woman?" he managed to gasp out. "That you sit down there, sir, and, like a dutiful  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7146-00000076"/> 126      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, husband, unfold the secrets of thy heart to thy spouse, so that the knowledge thereof may enable her to bear a porion of thy troubles, which she is willing to do, provided thou speakest the truth, and leaveth nothing untold." "Was Alvah here to-day?" "Alvah was not here to-day. Why do you ask such a question? Do you want to have God's minister mixed up in your business with your niece?" Mr. Morton was silent for a few minutes. Only a few minutes, and yet, during that short period, his mind had quickly glanced over every act. of which he had been guilty towards his poor, unoffending niece, and in par- ticular of the manner in which he permitted himself to be made a tool of by his designing wife. Mrs. Morton appeared as if she had quickly compre- hended the inmost thoughts of her husband. At best that was no very difficult problem, especially when the interpreter of such things was Mrs. Morton, and when the subject of that lady's analysis was her weak-minded husband. "I see your thoughts on your face," said Mrs. Mor- ton, addressing her conscience-stricken partner. "No you don't, you old beldame," was the polite re- joinder. "To prove it, I tell you that you are wishing that you had not commenced this work, Alvah.!" "You lie; and not for the first time in your life, either," shouted out Alvah Morton, in a voice rendered hoarse with suppressed passion, and with a face of livid whiteness. As he spoke flecks of foam were on his lips, and his whole appearance betokened the strong emo- tions under which he labored. His wife never had wit- nessed such an appearance in him before, and for a few minutes even her stout and callous heart became troubled at the awful aspect created by her own innate villainy.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      127 "Could you not have said that your wife was mis- taken?" smirked out Mrs. Morton, with a sickly attempt at a smile, which she believed to be a potent spell over her husband. In this instance, at least, she was foiled, for, although she had correctly divined the thoughts of her husband, she now had cause to regret her outspoken manner. Alvah Morton was sensibly changed, whether for bet- ter or worse shall appear hereafter. One thing was quite certain: he was no longer the Alvah Morton who could be wheedled into doing or saying anything and everything to please his wife. That lady had lived rather an extravagant life, and, with all her decorous and rigid notions, had managed to bring her husband to the verge of ruin. Her habits, combined with too great a love of her children, and her desire to see them occu- py prominent positions in life, had been too great a strain on the business habits and income of her husband. She knew that already the fortune of Cecilia, which amounted to over 40,000 dollars, had been seriously in- terfered with; and having learned that Captain Buzzard, the commander and owner of a ship trading between Boston and the West Indies, was dying in love with Mr. Morton's ward, but feared to approach the young lady to make known his intentions, thought that there was nothing very serious in the matter of catching Cecilia and taking her away perforce. There was only a little bit of romance in the whole thing, and an honorable marriage would soon make all matters right. Besides this, the abduction was to have been an unknown affair to herself and husband, and how could they prevent an unforeseen accident. Such were the reasons with which this really guilty woman endeavored to satisfy her bad mind. She judged herself as she wished to be judged, not as she deserved. The world was everything to Mrs. Morton. She had  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7146-00000077"/> 128      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, some sort of hazy knowledge of a hereafter, but cared very little concerning the unknown state, although to hear her at times, when speaking of her son Alvah, one would have been led to believe that this woman was no only a sincere, but a pious Christian. So much for the religious shams of this world. Alvah Morton sat with his head cast downward. lHe scarcely appeared to notice the fact of his wife's pres- ence. "Then I suppose I am not to expect any decent an- swer from you at present," said the lady, in a tone of voice considerably changed from that used by her lately. "Where is Miss Crolly?" he asked. "In her room, I suppose. The last time I saw her she was on her knees, the little hypocrite, as usual." "The little hypocrite?" "Well, rm wrong there-the little angel, Irish angel, I should have said, perhaps."  "Of course, it never entered into my wife's mind to inquire what reason she has for her particular hatred- I was going to say dislike', but that word would not half express my meaning-of that poor girl?" "No, sir; it never entered your wife's head to enter- tain any such foolish notions. I am fully convinced that you owe more of your failure to that girl than to any other cause, and wish you so to understand it, sir. I never cast my eyes upon her, but I feel inclined to tear out hers, and no matter what the upshot of this busi- ness of yours-mind now I have said yours-I am de- termined that Crolly won't remain another week in this house. You hear me now, I suppose. Your ears are long enough for that purpose, and I know you can re- member things which you don't like, as well as H-I mean as well as any one else." Mrs. Morton had now wrought herself into the wild- est excitement of passion, no unusual thing for that   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      129 lady to do; but it did seenm just then to her husband as if he had never before beheld her in such a wild and un- governable state in all his life's experience. He felt an evil spirit arise within himself-a spirit of anger, resent- ment, and recrimination, as if called forth by the demon then holding sway in the breast of his wife. He started to-his feet, while his eyes glared with a vicious fire. "Look, now, madam," he said, addressing and ap- proaching his wife at the same moment, "I'd sooner boil over and scald you than restrain myself. I have been a wicked tool in your hands for the basest of all purposes. Not only now, but for many a long and painful year have I been so; but latterly I have heark- ened to your worse than murderous designs, and all through your greed of money. It is not the first time I have been led to act an unscrupulous part at your insti. gation. it is the last. Hear it, n'ow, thou worse, than devil! it is the last!" and Alvah Morton screamed him- selt hoarse, as he uttered the last words, and held his clenched fist in a menacing manner close to the face of his wife. That lady permitted herself to drop into a seat. She attempted the old game of hysteria, but in the present instance did not succeed. The contortions of her mouth showed plainly enough the dreadful workings of her mind, but a single word she either qould not or did not attempt to utter. Alvah Morton enjoyed her discomfiture, as if it had been to. him the greatest treat he had ever enjoyed. Springing to his feet, he darted from the room, know. Mug well that to leave his wife's presence at that partic- ular juncture, was to add to her misery and chagrin. -As he rose to leave, she opened her eyes with a sort of languid expression, intended to convey the meanino to Alvah's mind that she had been utterly unconsal ou of all that had passed.  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7146-00000078"/> 130      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, The only response to this act was a glare from the hus- band, accompanied with a compression of the teeth which plainly meant: If you assumed the form of an angel you could deceive me no longer. And so the mutual wrath of this ill-assorted pair pleased the Spirit of Evil, and made their unhappy minds to experience something like the sufferings of the damned.  ,         .    THE VIOLATED TOMB.      131 CHAPTER XXI. CAPTAIN BUZZARD'S INDIFFERENCE ABOUT HS WORIK-- HARRY CRAZE DESCRIBES BIDD  IN A  UNEQUAL ENCOUNTER. "An outrage on the humble, A sneer and a jibe-for the poor, Is the work of dastard and coward, Whom MEN drive from their door." WHEN Captain William Buzzard had joined his party, after his late interview with Mr. Morton, he learned that Harry Buck in a fit of drunken enthusiasm had in- formed his companions of the fact that Cecilia was safe- ly concealed in the "Nunnery." Captain Buzzard did not know exactly whether to feel pleased or angry at this disclosure. Had the like happened before he had received the last hundred dol- lars from Alvah Morton, it is more than likely that he would have evidenced his displeasure unmistakably, but somehow he began to fancy that he saw some disposi- tion of relenting on the part of Morton, and just then he was indifferent at the act of Buck. "That 'Nunnery 'ain't good for nothin', "was the sage remark of Rat Keeley, to those around him. "Yes; it is that," said Buck. "It's good for some- thin ' more nor nothin '." 'Well; you jist mention, for I can't see." "Ain't it good for the black un's who live on the young un's, and don't our Selectmen support it, for the black un's witcheries makes even them come down with the  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7146-00000079"/> 132      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, yaller chinks for eddication purposes, Mr. Keeley. Don't yer see?" "No; I'm blind," was the answer. "In course you are, blind drunk you may be, but you ain't no ways blind with them ere peepers of yourn, that I can see, and we all can see it. Can't we, boys?" "Every one on us," was the general reply.  j "Cutter's brick men are right," said Jack Buzzard, with a fiendish expression of countenance, most revolt- ing to look at. "Right, how? What way? Ain't you one of Cutter's men, Jack?" were the inquiries of Mr. Harry Buck. "I were, and I ain't. Who'd give a damn for the Boss. He squeezes us as we squeeze clay, and builds up dollars by means of us, jist as you'd build a big house. But his men are bricks, do you hear now!" There was uproarious laughter at this independent speech and witticism-of Jack Buzzard, who felt delighted at the indirect praise of his cleverness by his compan- ions. "Did none of yer observe the fight 'tother day be- tween the big Irishwoman and one of Cutter's chaps?" inquired Harry Craze. "That's one of Craze's yarns," said Jack Buzzard. "No yarn, but truth," was the reply, "' and I tell yer she walloped him till one of his chum's came up and re- lieved him out of chancery." "Well; spin us the whole of it, if you're inclined," suggested Buzzard,."' and here!s a drink of yellow Tom to begin with. Lots o' drink and nothin' to do, that's my game; so give us a history of the fight." "Aye; aye;" chorused one and all, "give us a his-. tory of the fight, Harry? '"Reach that bottle over here," said the latter. Half filling a. dirty goblet with the contents of the bottle, Craze took a long draught, lit his pipe, and commenced   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       133 as follows:-"It was the day before yesterday, and shortly after the men had given over work, jist as I was a-coming down RMedford Road. I heard a voice right be- hind shouting out 'Hilloa. Craze, ole boy, how goes it?' I turns round right away, and there, before me, was young ' Fishpond--' , "What! Pressy Pond?" asked Buzzard. "No, Jack, not Pressy, but 'tother cove; Pressy's coz, you know." "Oh, young ' Fishy' as we calls him-the feller with the eyes?" "The same, Jack. 'So you're here in these parts again?' says I. 'Wasn't a bit farther off than New Hamp. this many months,' was the answer. So we chatted and walked along till we comes up to where the Irish woman. keeps her fruit stall. Three or four of Cutter's men were standing around, and the very first thing we sees was Tom Clacker a movin' round and round, and a pitchin' in with his jaw to the apple-seller. 'Here's a muss,' said Fishy, and we hurries on jist in time to see Clacker dodge his head and nail the woman on the nose. ' Go it, Clacky,' says one of the others, and Clacky tried, but couldn't. It was better nor a play to see the color of Mr. Clacker's face; I thought a pity for him, for he was bumin' over. He looked like a cheat, he did, take my word on't. 'What brought'n you here, and the likes of you, that's what I should like to know,' he said, addressin' the fruit woman. ' You're a Nunnery woman,' he added, right up to her face. Then there was a laugh all 'round. ' What are them black snipes up there?' said Clacker, pointing onwards to the Nunnery. ' What are they for, and what are the girls for, can't you answer, woman?' and before Tom could gather more breath, the Irish woman had bunged his mouth with a hard apple. Oh, it was fun, I tell you. ' Stick that in your jaw, you hungry clay mixer,'  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7146-00000080"/> 134      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, said the woman, as she flung the fruit right against Clacker's teeth. He couldn't stand that, and I saw it, and cried out ' fair play! ' ' Tumble her shop,' said a fellow beside Clacker, and down went the concern all of a heap. Fishy and I pocketed a few fruit, and the others did the same; and just as the woman stooped to gather up her goods, Clacker slipped round and gave her such a wiper in the ear as nearly tumbled the crea- ture. But, by heavens, she up and at him, and before one on us had time to think, she made the red go from his nose like a small New England river. Clacker coughed and sneezed, and down came her fist again, right 'atween his eyes. He looked up, but couldn't look straight. He then hobbled, and she gives him such a pounder right in the stomach this time, as sent poor Clacker half way over the road. I couldn't stand to see a fellow nailed in that ere fashion, and I approached the fruiter and inquired how she do? It wasn't her fist, this time, but her foot that she presented at me, and I never, in all my natural life, was so near catching a rib squeezer as at that moment; but Fishy give me a pull, and I jumped aside-" "You caught it, Craze, acknowledge it like a man," vociferated Buck. kWell, only slightly, though. I made a plunge at the offender, and caught her right below the ear. Clacker was clever, for he was slightly recovered, and he made a spring at the same moment. She got cured, I tell you, for she staggered like a feller after rum. 'Give it her on the snout,' cried out Fishy, but there were two ugly looking Paddies coming quickly down the road, so we thought better nor stop to see another muss." "Of course you did, and quite right to mind your d-d eyes, that showed you the ugly looking Paddies- a   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      135 comi' down the road," exclaimed Jack Buzzard, with a most contemptuous sneer at his companion, Craze. "There were five or six o' you, and you hooked it," continued Buzzard; " destroying the good character of us all," he continued. Craze felt rather chop-fallen at the remarks of Buz- zard. He had intended a good laugh at the recital of his own and Clacker's prowess, and, instead of that, he saw displeasure burning in the face of Buzzard, and dissatisfaction on the faces of the others. "Well, all I can say is, that she deserved all she got, and more," muttered Craze. "We have put up too long with those Irish, and their Nunneries and Mass Houses, their Nuns and Priests, and all the rest of them," growled Harry Craze, anxious to say something to con- ciliate his boon companions. "That's true, at any rate," nodded Captain William Buzzard. "That's true," added brother Jack. Harry Craze had a strong suspicion that he had struck the right chord, seeing that Buck had not scrupled to tell all that he knew about Cecilia Morton's where- abouts. "And there's that girl, Miss Morton:" he ih' "siowed away in some of the cells, and by all accounts which I learned from Fishy Pond, them cells are just like graves, and it is known that things take place in that Nunnery as no one knows anything about. Fishy told myself that his coz is married on a sister of a girl who was in that Nunnery, and she had to jump. two fences before she got off, and then she was chased and caught, and pulled back again into them dark cells," and Craze looked around for some expression of admiration. "Who in d-n would believe anything that 'Becca  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7146-00000081"/> 136      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Reed would say," cried out Keeley, with a sort of snort that proved that individual's contempt for Craze's au- thority. "I tell you she wrote a book on't," emphatically re- plied Craze. "Pressy Pond did, at any rate for her, or tried to, but we all knows that crowd of beats very well. The girl ain't worth nothin'. She's all spite because she aren't a lady-woman. First she goes a dyin' about Alvy Morton, of the Hanover meetin' place. That game don't take. INext she tries it on with his brother, which is ten times worse. Then she gets into the Nun- nery through charity sake, and the black un's spots her out, and won't give her her way by any means; and after that she bolts, and thinks to impose on the public, but we ain't sich fools as to gulp down 'Becca Reed's yarns." When Keeley delivered himself of the foregoing, he helped himself to a mouthful or two of strong liquor. Craze was delighted to hear such remarks from Mr. Rat Keeley, inasmuch as he hoped that that individual would be looked upon as trying to uphold the character of the Nunnery; but in this he was also mistaken, for Jack Buzzard and the others maintained that Rat Keeley was right. Capt. Buzzard suddenly reminded himself that he had a place to attend in half an hour, and must leave. Having expressed himself to theF effect that nothing practical could be done in the matter of their work, he left, promising to see his friends soon. Shortly after his departure the others followed his example, each with the idea in his mind that Nunneries and Papists, and Irish people, were things that should not be permitted to thrive in New England.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       137 CHAPTER x x i . CECILIA'S PRESENCE A SURPRISE AMONG HER RELA- TIVES - EXPLANATIONS AND APPARENT   CONSE- QUENCES. "To their surprise and wonder A saint beside them stood, Whose heart was quite 100oo saintly To understand that brood." IT was a customary thing for Cecilia Morton, both before and after her first interview with Kate Crolly, to keep to her room or walk abroad, just as she liked, without let or hindrance from either her uncle, or without the slightest knowledge on the part of her aunt. For several days she would thus continue to act guardian. At first this course seemed very unsatis- factory, and even faulty, to Kate Crolly, but usage and constant explanation on the part of Cecilia soon recon- ciled Kate to that which appeared to her, at first, as singularly imprudent. One of the principal causes which led to this course by Cecilia, was the ill-concealed dislike which she bore towards her aunt and uncle. She disliked their com- pany, and, consequently, seldom appeared among them, except when the strictest requirements of society de- manded her presence-seldom, if ever, otherwise. From this it will readily be seen how much Cecilia stood in need of a companion such as Kate Crolly. Had the latter been different from what she was, there can be no question but that Cecilia Morton's mind and conscience would also have been different.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7146-00000082"/> 138      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, How few there are amongst us fit to properly realize either the goodness and fruitfulness of good example and good companionship, or the terrible and bad effects of evil example. ; Cecilia and Kate had returned in company with each other from the concert, and both had been for over eighteen hours in the house of Cecilia's guardian with- out the slightest knowledge on the part of Mr. or Mrs. Morton. By the merest accident Cecilia had overheard the greater part of the conversation and conflict between her uncle and aunt, but, in consequence of a delay which occurred, owing to her unsuccessful attempt to induce Kate to accompany hey to the lobby to hear the pair, Cecilia very fortunately missed hearing several things which her quick comprehension might have in- terpreted in a manner too truthfully for her own subse- quent peace of mind. "Kate, we will go down to the parlor to-morrow morn- ing, and breakfast with-with the people of this house." "I am quite satisfied, Cecilia; but will not poor Mary, your aunt's ' help,' suffer in consequence of not making known our presence here?" "Mary very seldom speaks, and when she does con- descend to open her mouth she is vulgarly reminded to 'shut up!' which she does on the instant, and feels rather refreshed afterward if she is told that she should have spoken of this thing and that other thing." Kate was not very hard to be made a convert to the' plans of Cecilia. Next morning, Alvah Morton, his wife, and their eld- est son, the minister, and Dr. Morton, the younger brother, were seated at breakfast and earnestly discuss- ing the news they had received concerning the safety of Cecilia at Mount Benedict Convent, AND HER FORCED DETENTION THERE BY THE LADIES IN-BLACK!   THE YIOLITED TOMB.       139 "It's a spoiled case," said Alvah Morton, Sen. "By G-d, it ain't any spoiled case," exclaimed th younger son, most emphatically. "If David we we should soon have some bloody work in this s t' Alas! yes; my dear child David," sobbed the lady of the house, without any particular reference as to Ce- cilia, or, in fact, to anything else. "But David ain't here, and so much the better," said Dr. Morton. "There must be some steps taken at once to place this business righit before the public," quietly remarked the Rev. Alvah Morton, Jun. "Which business, dear Coz?" said. Cecilia Morton, who, in company with Kate Crolly, had just then en- tered the parlor. Mrs. Morton did not faint; on the contrary, she sat right up in her straight-backed chair with lips com- pressed and eyes staring, as if she had been a resusci- tated corpse. She looked again and again, from Ce- cilia to Kate, and from Kate to Cecilia. Occasionally she heaved a deep sigh, which appeared to give her im- mense relief, especially in the breathing apparatus of her body. Alvah Morton, Sen., hung his head down till his chin reached his breast. His sons looked from one side to the other, with an aspect of wonderment that caused their cousin Cecilia to utter a laugh such as she had not done for many weeks past. "Take a seat, please, Miss Crolly," said Cecilia, at the same time handing a chair to Kate. The latter took the proffered place with an air of sang -froid that caused Mrs. Morton to change her particular gaze into a series of eye-twitchings, which assuredly were not lost upon her keen-sighted niece. "My love!" exclaimed Mr. Alvah Morton, " this is indeed a surprise."  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7146-00000083"/> "O      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "I should think so, dear Uncle," was the quiet reply. "And Miss Crolly, too!" he continued. "How is my poor child?" "Quite well; thanks," was the quiet answer of Kate. "Why, my life! ain't you in the ' Nunnery ' place?" inquired Dr. Morton, as he gazed on Cecilia, who just then looked better than she had probably ever looked before in all her life. "Not just now, dear Cousin, as you may perceive. I am here-here, observe you," said Cecilia, with some- thing more than a particular animation in the tone of her voice. "Yes, by Jove and Jupiter, you are there-here, I mean, and no mistake," exclaimed young Dr. Morton; "but --but - hang it-weren't you in the 'Nunnery' concern, Cecilia?" "Do you mean the Convent of Mount Benedict?" quietly asked Cecilia. "Yes, of course; that place, you know, where the people - the women - go in mourning," was the response. "The same," answered Cecilia; "but you see, dear Cousin, I always like to call places by their proper names, so that there may be no misunderstanding. I was in the Convent, not altogether willingly--" i "I knew it, I knew it!" screamed forth Mrs. Morton, in a voice as if her heart would assuredly burst. "Our niece- your niece, Mr. Morton -has been wilfully enticed into that woman's place; kept there, imprisoned, while her poor aunt and uncle and dear cousins were searching the world all over for our lost child. Comei to my arms, lost one; restored one; the beauty of our house; our dear Cecilia," cried out- Mrs. Moi ton,who sprang from her seat and rushed to embrace "our" niece. It should be observed here that Cecilia had not even   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      141 the remotest notion that her uncle or aunt were aware of the deep designs which she had been made the victim. She partly blamed herself for her want of thoughtful- ness in not sending them word of her safety, but she felt that in so doing she should mention the place that had so kindly given her shelter, and her inward con- sciousness of her aunt's intolerance forbade even the thought of such information. Kate Crolly had very different ideas regarding Mr. and Mrs. Morton; but even she attributed their carelessness in looking after Cecilia's whereabouts to a cause very different from the real one. Mr. Morton was very conscience-stricken at the appearance of the two young ladies; but his want of demonstrativeness was a proof both to Cecilia and Kate of an apparent depth of suffering, which had the effect of making them sympathize with him. Alas! for the short-sightedness of poor human nature. Here was a man conscience-stricken with the enormity of his guilt. He saw the finger of God clearly, in the break-down of his evil purposes. He reflected on these things, and poor Kate and Cecilia thought they beheld in him sorrow and broken-heartedness for the trouble occasioned him by the abduction of Cecilia. Here was the wife of that man, in a condition to deceive the devil himself. Half tears and half hysteric laughs at the re-appearance, and, therefore, safety, of Cecilia. She knew that Cecilia was aware of her hatred of that "woman's place," and did not attempt to, conceal her dislike of the Convent of MOUNT BENEDICT even in the moment of her supreme happiness at beholdingo Cecilia once more in her old place in the family circle! "Why so dull, Uncle?" asked Cecilia, with a merry voice and pleasant look. "Dull, child? Why do you ask?"  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7146-00000084"/> "2      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Aye, dear child, why do you ask?" murmured Cecilia's aunt. "Seeing as how your poor, dear uncle never knew a moment's comfort since- since that unfortunate affair took place. Oh! it breaks my poor affectionate heart to think of it, even now, much less to dwell upon it; seeing as how Heaven has once more restored to our midst our niece, our dear girl, Cecilia." Saying which, Mrs. Morton covered her face with her hands in apparent sorrow, but in reality to look through the spaces of her fingers, in order to learn, by a glance at Cecilia's face, how far successful she had been in her imposition. "And do you not know, my dear child," continued that woman, " how as your dear uncle run the risk of losing his life in your regard. That he did. And, oh! Cecilia, he is not yet restored from the fright into which his courage roused him for you. He darted forth, half naked, after those villains, and fired volley after volley among them; and you know, dear Alvah," said the speaker, " how, when you returned, you thought your poor heart would break, not knowing how as whether you might not have injured even our niece, whom you went forth to save. Oh, Cecilia! thank Heaven that I have a husband, and-you an uncle.; thank Heaven, dear child, that our protectors are still spared to us in this the Egyptian bondage of our lives." Both Cecilia and Kate were almost driven to shed tears at the sympathetic recital of all the sufferings endured by the Morton family, both in consequence of the sad fatality that had overtaken Cecilia, and, the dangers encountered by Mr. Morton in behalf of our niece. It may appear strange, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that Mrs. Morton appeared kind, even to Kate Crolly, on that occasion. Whether this arose from the knowl- edge on Mrs. Morton's part that she had succeeded, not   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      143 only in allaying all suspicion as to the true cause of Ce- cilia's abduction, or from the belief that she had man- aged to prove to all who heard her the sufferings en- dured by her husband and herself in consequence of said abduction, is not certain; but that the wife of Alvah I4orton felt just then exceedingly happy at the knowl- edge of her own power and resources, is a truth which required no demonstration.  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7146-00000085"/> "4.     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPTER XXIITI. FISHY POND IN A CONVERSATION WITH CAPTAIN BUZ- ZARD-HNTS REGARDING 'BECCA REED'S CAREER. "Trying to out-do each other Is the work of knaves, 1MEN are free from all such bother, From the cradle to their graves." FISHY Pond, brother to Pressy Pond, the brother-in- law of 'Becca Reed, the lady who had been admitted for charity's sake into Mount Benedict Convent, was a creature of a very low order of morals or. intellect. By the merest accident he got to be acquainted with the brothers Buzzard, and, owing to some hints which had fallen from these men, he believed that a further ac- quaintanceship with them would somehow lead to his advantage. For that purpose Fishy Pond lost no op- portunity of ingratiating himself with the Buzzards. He was very anxious to tell them something which he had learned concerning the Nunnery, and having ob- tained from Harry Buck a slight knowledge concerning the business of that worthy and his companions, he felt delighted at the opportunity thus opened to him of vin- dicating (?) certain statements of his brother's sister-in- law, Miss 'Becca. e It was not long until Fishy Pond was afforded an op- portunity of putting his evil designs into execution. Meeting Captain Buzzard one day accidentally in Bos- ton, Fishy Pond made great demonstrations of joy at the meeting, and insisted on having the pleasure of   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       145 treating his new acquaintance. Captain Buzzard was just on his way down to his!" ship " in the harbor, but had no particular objection to have a drink with Mr. Pond. Arrived at a suitable place both entered, and in a few minutes were deeply engaged in conversation concern- ing the Nunnery. "It's the worst place, Mr. hBuzzard, in all New Elng land-aye, in all America. Miss Reed, a clever girl, I tell you, was enticed into the place by false promises as to how she would be a lady, and after listening to all the promises made by a Bishop, and six or seven of them Priests, and as many of the Nuns, she consented to enter the Nunnery, and from the first moment of her entrance till the hour she made her escape, her life was the most wretched, the most miserable, that any human creature ever endured." These were wonderful statements for Fishy Pond to make, but he had received his instructions from Pressy, a bigger but more cunning scoundrel than himself. "You don't say 1" was the terrible exclamation of Captain Buzzard, who looked at the speaker with star- ing eyes and open mouth, as if he had been dreadfully stunned by all he heard. ' Fact, sir" continued Fishy. i "There ain't anything like it, sir, in all creation. 'Becca is, cute, I tell you, and it required the exercise of all her qualities to keep up an appearance till such time as her opportunity would come round. More nor once, r twice, nor ten times she tried to get out on business. But all was of no use. Then she would be discovered a sitting down and cry- ing as if her poor heart would break." "Break!" ejaculated Fishy's hearer. "Yes, indeed, sir, break; and soon after a scene of this kind one day, she was dragged by the hair by two of them black Nuns, and pulled down stairs and put into 10  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC7146-00000086"/> "6      MOUNT BENDICT; OR, a black hole of a place. where she was kept for three days and three nights without even a drink of water or a crust of bread. Oh I her sufferings were sufferings, I tell you." The last assertion was considered necessary by Fishy, for Captain Buzzard had just begun to rub his nose, a gentle reminder that his doubts about Fishy's story were momentarily increasing. Fishy observed the look of unbelief, and would have sworn to every word he had uttered, rather than Captain Buzzard should doubt even the smallest of his asser- tions. "But that did not even starve her," Fishy again began. "But what had she done-what were 'Becca's faults?" naturally inquired Mr. William Buzzard. "Faults-faults? why, of course, because she would not go down on her knees and pray to the head lady, the one as lords it over the others, and-because-be- cause-she-she would not condescend to-to-" "Comne now, Fishy-to what?" "Well, I ain't very good at memory, but 'Becca is the girl could tell you herself. I never heard anything like it in all my days. Her hair was pulled out by the roots, two of her teeth knocked out, her eyes swelled with blows and with tears, the nails of her toes pulled out with pincers, a weight of five hundred pounds placed upon her head, her arms stretched until they were three inches longer than usual, her ears pulled by strings till they cracked, large woodeiin, but sharp-pointed skewers were placed around her ribs, her nose was filled up with plaster, and her neck compressed till she could scarcely give a scream."          . "Hold! hold! Mr. Pond," shouted out Captain Buz- zard. "I have heard of tortures, but the like of that-" "I knew your heart would melt, sir- -" ,-1, h r o viA a nd vonur 'Becca together! Do you   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      147 fancy there's even one fool in the world, mubch less in old Massachusetts, that could be got to believe one-tenth of the yarns you spin?" "Well, I did think, Mr. Captain, that you were about the last man on earth as would doubt anything concern- ing that stne Nunnery, and the afflictions as follows those who are coaxed into it. But there's one as I knows who believed every word I have told you, and ten times more!" "And who is he?" innocently inquired Buzzard. It s not a he, by no means--it's a the!" "I was just a-wondering," quietly remarked the Captain. ' But you have no need to wonder!" "I s'pose it was 'Becca herself?" "Nosir  t we ren't 'Becca-but a lady as you knows There was a pause of a few moments, during which Captain Buzzard kept scanning the face of Fishy Pond, to try and fully comprehend that creature's reference to a lady whom he himself knew well. He verily be- lieved at the moment that that assertion of Pond's was like all the others concerning the ill-used 'Becca. "That I know well?" "Why, certainly! Don't yer know Alvah Morton's wife?" Captain William Buzzard made one or two uneasy movements in his seat, somewhat indicative of a hostile intention towards Pond, but the latter was utterly igno- rant of the faintest idea of having given any offence, and therefore did not anticipate even an angry word much less a violent personal attack, such as Captain Buzzard contemplated, in consequence of Fishy's refer- ence to Mrs. Morton. Oh, of course! I know Alvah Morton's wife-that is, I saw the lady once or twice-no, only once, I be- lieve," slowly repeated the Captain.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7146-00000087"/> "8      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "Well, then 1ll tell you: she says as how you're an excellent gentleman-fit for any lady-that you're the owner and captain of a ship, and she's proud of her acquaintance with you." The Captain nearly slipped off his seat with excite- ment, as he heard these words from his then companion. he had some doubts of Pond, especially in relation of 'Becca Reed's sufferings in the Nunnery at Mount Bene- dict; but now that he had proved himself to be in the confidence of Mrs. Alvah Morton, he felt more inclined to be friendly with Fishy Pond, in hopes that he might learn something further concerning the opinion enter- tained in his regard by Mrs. Morton. Captain Buzzard had some sort of indefinite notion that Mrs. Morton was not ignorant of the relationship in villainy which existed between her husband and him- self. He had no particular proof of this; neither was there any way by which he could arrive at any correct knowledge of it, although he sincerely wished to pos. sess some information under that head. "You are well acquainted with Mrs. Morton, I sup- pose?" asked the Captain, addressing Fishy Pond. "Well, not exactly what you call well acquainted, although I does know her. She's a woman as is pretty strong, and pretty well made to make her man much as she likes to." "You don't say!" was again the extraordinary re- mark of Captain Buzzard. "Yes, I do say; and what's more, I intend to say something else besides." "You do, do you?" "Why, certainly!" "And what may that be, Mr. Pond-my friend, Mr. Pond, I should have said?" "Well now, you see I ain't so sure about expressing things as I know-especially as regards the Mortons."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      149 "But, my dear feller, there ain't a thing-nonot a thing -as I pertickerly cares about; but yer see as how I only remarks about your intimacy with a good lady-that is Mrs. Alvah Morton." "A good lady I " laughed Fishy Pond. "Well, that's good, any how. Yes, she is a good lady; but as to where her goodness lies, I can't say. For certain, she is good to herself, and no mistake." "I think she is good to all alike," quietly remarked the Captain. "Oh! most decidedly, nothing wrong in that; but that she bears any very kindly regards for you is more nor I can swear to." "How-what do you mean, Mr. Pond?" " I means nothin'," quietly remarked the cunning idiot; "at least nothin' of consequence. I don't think as how Mrs. Morton would exactly die for you; p'raps she might, but as far as I can guess she don't like to die for any one-no, not even you, -not even for Alvah, ,nor 'tother Alvah; but I think I does know as to how she would like to live for every body. She is so kind, so very kind!" "No doubt on it-no, not, the least doubt," was the somewhat careless reply of Captain Buzzard. The lat- ter gentleman made several ineffectual attempts at learning something more concerning Mrs. Morton's opinion of hinself, but failed. Fishy Pond was not to be drawn out further than that individual desired. To all intents and purposes, Mr. Pond was much the inferior of Captain William Buzzard-at least the latter so believed; and leaving him in that belief, we have now to transfer our notice to other remarkable accidents, inci- dents, and coincidents, of this remarkable story. Messrs. Pond and Captain Buzzard will probably meet together again before the close of this work. They were both what they were.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7146-00000088"/> 150      MOUNT BlElNMEDICT; OR, CHAPTER XXIV. XATE CROLXY'S INTUITIVE WDSTETP OF MRS. MOR- TON - A DECLARATION ON THE PART OF CECILIA WHCH MADE KATE'S HEART GLAD. "You have my mind regarding her, Take it for what itW' worth." "My soul to God in thanks I give, My sister now doth surely lve." "WHAT a pity it must have been, after all," began Cecilia, in addressing Kate Crolly, the morning after her sudden appearance in her uncle's house, "to wit- ness the horrors endured by uncle, aunt, and cousins, when they learned what had taken place in my regard, and without the slightest knowledge of my where- abouts. Oh, what they must have suffered!" To Cecilia's very evident surprise, Kate did not seem to enter into the spirit of her warmly expressed excla- mations. "I do think, Kate, that the rude language of coz Dr. Morton, must have been highly offensive to you." "Which language do you refer to, dear Ceeilia??" in- quired Kate, looking up innocently into her companion's face. "Why the rough words uttered by the Doctor con- cerning Mount Benedict." "Pardon me, I did not hear him utter anything what- ever." "Well, now, I'm glad of that, Kate, my beloved girl." "Indeed, Cecilia, I was thinking instead of listen- Ing."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      151 "Ah, you Irish baggage, I half guessed your mind at that moment," hissed a woman's voice who was listen- ing at the door. -"Poor aunt, bad as she is, has a woman's heart, Kate; and although she acts and speaks rashy and badly at times, I can easily understand the dreadful condition of her mind, racked and tortured with surprise, uncer- tainty, and fear." "Poor aunt, indeed!" repeated the voice of the un- seen. "How like a fool she prattles; his brother's daughter could be no other than she is, that is plain. Let'her only know how little I know, how little any of us know, and wouldn't New England get a taste of her temper. But i'll Watch our niece, and if that old fool fails hereafter, there's another and a safer means of reaching the half-born Papist." Saying which, the speaker departed; but not without being noticed. Had she remained only a very few minutes longer, she would have heard something from Kate Crolly of a more unpleasant character than anything she had then learned. "I am -not so thoroughly satisfied regarding your aunt's innocence in this unfortunate business, as you seem to be, Cecilia," slowly replied Kate. "Neither do I believe in her appearances of joy at your return." "You partly shock me, dear Kate," was Cecilia's re- sponse. "I know, nay, I have always found you to be truth itself in all things, and I feel something like alarm in the dryness of your tone, and especially in the concealment of the meaning of your words. At one moment you inform me that you did not even hear the rude language of my cousin, and when I referred to his conduct, not by way of apology, indeed, but to soothe your feelings as I supposed, you quietly tell me that you did not hear a syllable of that which he uttered.

"Because my whole attention was rapt in the appear- ance of your aunt, Cecilia." "Well, come now, I shall insist on learning what my dear Kate thinks about aunt. Remember. I must have the whole of what Kate thinks," saying which, Ceeilia approached Kate and sat down closely beside her. *' You shall have the whole of my heart, Cecilia, on the subject, as you desire it, and it will not keep me long in disclosing to you all I wish to say. To my mind, your aunt is a hypocrite-a deep, designing woman, who does not believe in one syllable of what she has said re- garding her joy at seeing you restored to the family. 1 care nothing about her sons, for they are just as she has reared them, and just as she desires to see them. There now. Are you satisfied now, Cecilia?" "No, not satisfied; that- is, not fully and thoroughly satisfied," answered Cecilia, with particular thought- fulness, and a shade of sorrow spread over her beauti- ful face as she slowly made answer to Kate. "I know," she continued, " that you never give ut- terance to sentiments-rather should I say, to expres- sions, Kate-which do not spring from your heart, and consequently I feel the more strongly on anything ut- tered by you so seriously. May I further inquire, Kate, the grounds or reasons you possess for your belief; for I must consider what you have now said to amount to your fullest conviction?" "I judge as much from my own innate feelings, dear Cecilia-at least in this business-as from anything else." "No more than that?" "Perhaps from an unerring instinct, which I have never known to lead me astray as yet, especially when applied to just such subjects as we are now speaking of. I may be astray, Cecilia-quite possible, dear girl-but   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      163 you see I am thus plain with you in order ffilly to sat- isfy you regarding my impressions." "I am much afraid I do not fully comprehend you, Kate," was Cecilia's reply, with something like a trou- bled aspect of face. "You say your instinct in such cases is unerring, that you have never known it to lead you astray, and just in the next breath you admit that you may be astray." "Perhaps I should not have been too positive. You have marked my words very correctly, and I admitted the possibility of error on my part, more for the purpose of qualifying my previous remarks than aught else." "Then you do really adhere to your first assertion: that by the strength of an unerring instinct you believ Aunt Morton to be a hypocrite?" "I do, indeed!" "But you must remember you have had some time now to judge her character, her general habits and conduct?" "I acknowledge that you have some show of reason there to oppose me. But, believe me, Cecilia, had it been possible for me to have been thus plain with you, one hour after our first introduction to each other, I should have said then what I say now." This staggered Cecilia not a little. She fully believed, as she had a right to believe, every word uttered by Kate. She knew that the acquisition of all the world could not tempt Kate Crolly into a deliberate lie. "Well, we shall let this subject drop for the pres- ent," said Cecilia, "as I have something more of im- portance to speak to you about. Have you made final arrangements for entering Mount Benedict?"  "Indeed I have not, Cecilia, nor can I tell when I may. Soon as possible, I hope in God." "I have changed my mind a little, in regard to my own entrance."              .  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7146-00000090"/> 154      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Kate looked very disquieted: she dreaded a change in Cecilia, and therefore urged upon her the necessity of due regard to the step she was about to take, even in what concerned her own education. "You look puzzled-like, Kate." ' A little, I suppose, (Peeilia." "Well, be all attention now; weigh every word I say, and be prepared to give me your best-mind, your very best-opinion of what I utter." "I promise most faithfully, my love." "Hear, then: I prefer to enter Mount Benedict as a child of grace f" There was a dead silence for a few moments. Kate did not expect this announcement, and from the dispositions she lately saw manifested in Cecilia, she was very much surprised when she did hear it. Cecilia imagined that her companion was rather sud- denly shocked at what she had uttered; but Kate was inwardly thanking God and his Immaculate Mother for the blessing which had been thus vouchsafed to her ar- dent entreaties in Cecilia's behalf. "Well, Kate, what think you of that little declara- tion?" Kate flung herself into the arms of Cecilia, and twined her arms around her neck in a tender embrace. "How happy I feel," whispered Cecilia, "if this be your direct answer." Kate wept tears of joy, while Cecilia held the girl's pale hands in her own. "And then, sweet Kate, I shall be able to call you sister, and kneel down beside you full of faith-and, I hope also, full of love." "Thank God!" were the only words uttered by Kate. Her heart was too full for further utterance. Involuntarily, both girls dropped upon their knees, and, with eyes raised towards Heaven, poured forth the   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       155 sweetest incense of human hearts that ever wafted itself to Heaven. A beautiful ray of yellow light, soft as the first sweet beam of Spring, lingered lovingly over their heads like a halo of infinite beauty, warm with a new but unseen life, to quicken the birth of grace in a soul scarce stained with sin. 'T was a holy sight, and so we draw the veil softly around the happy hearts thus brought so close together by the love of simple lives.  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7146-00000091"/> 1t;66. MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAirTE1  XXV. A MEElTiNG OF RUFFIAN CONSPIRATORS-THREATS AND DENUNCIATIONS AGAINST THE CONVENT OF MOUNT BENEDICT. "Night made hideous by their demon yells, They seemed like devils from a thousand hells,- Nor heart, nor tongue, could think or speak But vengeance dire against the weak." "&amp; MR. David Dodge, gentlemen," said Fishy Pond, introducing a young scamp to a meeting held in an old empty building at the rear of Cutter's brick-field. "Glad to see Dodge." 6, Welcome, Davie, young buck." "Hand him a drink." "' Come to take part in our liberations for the freedom of this place from black lady eddicators, eh?" Such were a few, and only a few, of the words of welcome addressed to the new comer by those present at a meeting which consisted of about twenty ruffianly- looking men, most of them evidently of the lowest and rudest type of laborers in a brick-field. A few candles were placed here and there, on a large plank. which served the purposes of a table, and around which the men were placed, well supplied with whiskey, ale, and tobacco. Prominent among those present were William and Jack Buzzard, Harry Craze, Rat Keeley, Fishy Pond, Harry Buck, and a pair of ferocious looking scoundrels, known as Parker and Mason. These latter villains seemed to be among the roughest   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      157 and most drunken-looking of the whole lot. Their appearance would have condemned them to a halter in any decent and respectable community. "Who's that Davie you brought in a while ago?" inquired Jack Buzzard, in an undertone, of Fishy Pond. "Don't yer know our friend David?" was the answer. "How in hell should I know a brat as I never seen afore, till this night?" "Why, it's he as supplied nearly the whole of the drinks," whispered Pond. That's another of your damned lies!" shouted out Buzzard, which had the effect of bringing the "Captain" to the speaker's side. "It was our Bill, I say, as stood all the liquor, and he's prepared to stand more-" "Never mind, Jack," said his brother. "'It's all right." "No, it ain't all right, but it is all wrong. Here's Pond brings in a young 'un as no one knows, and when I only axed about him, lie turns round and tells me, as knows better, that the chap furnished all the stuff for the night.'" "Well, ask the Captain and see who's -right. Ain't I right, Cap?" "All right, Pond," was the answer. "Why, damn it, then you're the liar, Bill. But who's the young 'un? That I must know, for we're not agoin' to put our necks in ropes without knowin' who is likely to blab." "Bill will tell you," said Pond, who moved away. f  Bill would have preferred not to do anything of the I kind, but his loud-tongued brother left him no other al- ternative, so he stooped towards Jack's ear and whis- pered something therein which made Jack give a spring that upset the ricketty seat he had been using, and caused him to make a most hideous grin, which plainly showed that the semi-brute was well pleased.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7146-00000092"/> 158      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "Who the hell'd a thought it," he exclaimed to him- self. "No less a bird nor young Davie Morton. Well, here's a go, for sartin," and Jack Buzzard grinned again with a devilish species of delight. Springing to his feet, and filling a tumbler with dark-colored liquor, he ar- rested the attention of the others, who were smoking and drinking in small batches of twos and threes, with a shout which plainly indicated that he was not in such dread of publicity as he had appeared. "Gen'lemen, here's a clinker to our new friend, ' David Dodge.' To your feet, gen'lemen-to your feet, I say. Let every man fill as has a bit o' flint, and let the rest wait a turns. Here's to ' Davie Dodge,' I say. Hip, hip, hip, and a tiger." The toast, if it can so be dignified, was drank amid uproarious din and confusion, especially on the part of those who were anxiously awaiting their turn of the glasses. Many there were who did not choose to wait, but applied large black bottles to their equally black and begrimmed mouths, in order to testify their readi- ness to pay " honors " to their young companion. "David Dodge," drank his own health, and, after wip- ing his mouth, stood up to speak. At first sight it was pretty evident that Mr. Dodge had been imbibing freely before he entered. He was scarce- ly able to maintain his perpendicular, but he knew, or seemed to know his company, and did not care. Nat- urally, he bore the appearance of an idiot, although he was by far the best dressed person present. His drunk- en aspect made him still more idiotic looking, and when he attempted to speak he giggled like a fool. "We are all gentlemen here (hie) I (hie) 'spose. An- swer, gen'lemen, for your (hie) for your (hic) selves- selves, gentlemen (hie), mind (hic) that. Here's your (hie) nuns-your black (hie), black's the (hie) color- ain't it (hie), gen'lemen?

THE VIOLATED TOMB.      159 Having delivered himself of this short oration, Mr. Dodge looked around him with fixed, glassy-looking eyes, his mouth half open, and a filthy liquid streamnig therefrom. He was applauded, and his health drank over again. This caused the creature to laugh and gig- gle, and swear that those around him were gen'lemen of the right stamp. Pond next sprang to his feet to speak, but was im- periously commanded by Jack Butzzard to stick to his piece of timber." The others shouted out that Buzzard must not Inter- fere with the bizzness in hand, and so Fishy was per- mitted to go on. "I weren't a-goin to say much," began the-speaker; "but jist to say that-that it was me as had the honor of bringing Mr. Dodge to this meetin'. Not as he axed to come, but as I insisted- " "Darned liar!" remarked the individual referred to by the speaker. "Well, he only axed to knowmight he come, and I answered, sartin, yes; all the men will be glad to see you. Ain't that so, Mr. Davie?" "That's (hie) so (hie)," responded Davie, quite tickled, apparently, with the freedom of calling " darned liars," and then being appealed to for the purpose of answer. ing the important query, "Isn't that so?" "I knows young Mr. Dodge right well, an' I knows his good mother," continued Pond; " she's jist as good, an' as well disposed to our work as the best among us. She won't be behind, I tell you, when the right time comes, as will free this place from the curse that hangs over it." "Go it Fishy (hie) Pond; (hie) she's a good 'un, I know (hie); but blast the gov'nor," roared out Davie Dodge, alias Morton.

"Pond's right, an' I'm prepared to maintain every word as drops from his clapper," bawled out Rat Keeley, by way of confirmation; "' and the people think as how it Is better not to interfere; but we're the people-mind that! We're the people, I say, an', by Heaven, we shall Interfere!" An uproarious noise, clapping of hands, shouts of "'ere, 'ere," and rattling of glasses and empty bottles, succeeded this speech of the wily fox who delivered it. "I rise," said Mr. Jack Buzzard-who was afraid of the popularity of Pond rising too high-"I rise," he said, I to give information to all the gen'Iemen present- remember, I say, to all the gentlemen here aroun' this- this festive board, that I know, and that one or two others of us, the people-as Pond has rightly announced it- knows, that in this place called the Nunnery, there is a lady-mind now, gen'lemen, a lady, as I says, who is there, and who is kept there against her own knowledge -I mean against her friends' knowledge; and are we, as men, to know these things, and not go over there- aye, this very night-and ransack that ere buildin' till we find her, and then turn them she-devils, as I calls them, out of their nice quarters. What say you, gen'le. men? Ain't we right to purtect ourselves?" "Of coorse we are!" was the general response from all present. "Then let us drink to the success of our work," roared out Jack Buzzard; " and here's damnation, and a long time of it, too, to the man who doesn't drink to these sentiments, or who would go back upon the work of rooting out that ere rookery with its black crows." If Fishy Pond received the applause of the assembled ruffians, Buzzard received wild acclamations. The   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      161 brute felt satisfied, and added to his insane ardor by quaffing a tumbler of rum and water, filled to the brim. "What I wants to learn," 'said Mason, a man of the very lowest type, and the possessor of a face that at once stamped him as a composition of evil without a single redeeming trait of manhood or generosity "I wants to know if the hands here are enoughto carry this work right straight throgh? ,h "There are plenty on us," cried Buck and Craze in the same breath. "'Cause you must know," continued Mason, "that Parker and myself can get plenty of help from chums as we know in New Hampshire." "Bravo! bravo!" was the general response. "Here's to Mason, the jolliest dog in the crowd.", "I thanks you all,' cried out that individual, whose vanity was specially gratified at what he considered a compliment to his wisdom, but what was, after all, a point gained to shield his Own cowardice. The night was spent by that congregaton of black- guards in a fitting carousal. Deep curses and impre- cations were breathed against the poor defenceless nuns of Mount Benedict, who were just then wrapped in sweet slumber. after offering up the pious prayers of their gentle hearts to God for all sinners, and for their reclamation from the ways of vice. Their dreams, if they had any, must have been of heavenly things, for their souls knew no thought of evil, even to the least of mankind. All was beautiful around them-peace hallowed their dwelling, for the spirit of grace abided there.

"Go search the world, and a happier place It is not oft to mortals given, To see and know that here is grace, Divinely shed as gifts from heaven." THE sixth day of August, A. D. 1834, was a happy day in the chapel of the Conyvent of Mount Benedict. Some beautiful preparations had been made by the nuns in honor of the Feast of the Transfiguration. Early in the morning, it became evident that something of more than usual interest was about to take place. Out in the flower-garden were two of the Sisters gath- ering the dew-bespangled flowers, to adorn the altar and enrich it with their sweet fragrance and bright colors. The happy and healthy look of those pure-souled be- ings bespoke the sweet contentment of their minds. They must, in some way, have considered themselves privileged to engage in this work, so ardently did they relish their employment. They plucked nothing but the rarest flowers, leaves, and buds, to enrich their store, and a goodly treasure lay before them from which to select the bouquets and wreaths their nimble fingers wove. They had sown the seeds of those flowers themselves, watched them, nur- tured and tended them in sunshine and rain. That   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       163 garden was to them and their associates, and the pupils under their charge, a little paradise of flowers. With their own tender hands they uprooted every weed, and took especial pleasure, in their moments of relaxation, to train every spray, and make every flower-bed a nur- sery of sweet odors and bright leaflets, in order to train and attune the minds of those committed to their charge. Rake and hoe lay scattered around, and here and there were plots of ground newly sown for winter flowers. Iin several parts of the garden were little heaps of dried leaves, and broken twigs and stems, showing that earlier in the season the gardens attached to'Mount Benedict had given fourth several harvests. Lilies and star-like flowers were hastily clipped from their tiny stems; roses, and sweet-smelling leaves from odorous plants, were -mixed together, so that their united perfume and harmonic arrangement of color might make a pleasing offering of nature for the Con-- vent altar. It was a sweet employment for those child-like Sis- ters, and one, too, in which they took great delight-ex- periencing a holy joy at being thus enabled to assist in the outward decoration of that spot on,which their souls' truest and best affections were centred. Behold the pale faces of those holy Nuns, as they bend over the bright offerings of earth and cull them, as one would gather precious gems, to lay around the altar on which the great Sacrifice was to be celebrated that day. Already those Sisters were enjoying, by anticipation the transfiguration which awaited them in a higher and holier state hIereafter. In every sparkling floral gem they beheld mysteries unseen by the common eye. The diversified works of Him whom they so ardently loved and labored to serve, enchanted their souls and opened a way for thoughts unknown to those who make the pleasures of life their god. i  .   &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7146-00000095"/> 164      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, They have finished their appointed work, and now hasten to lay their gifts where the mysterious Sacrifice of Love is about to be consummated. Cecilia Morton and Kate Crolly have already arrived in the Chapel of the Convent. They are permitted to occupy seats near the Mother Superior. Cecilia is dressed in virgin white. A holy calm o'erspreads her face and makes it radiant with divine love. Kate's whole appearance betokened an ineffable sweetness and joy. There was something like super- natural happiness in her soul which betrayed itself in the outward composure of her whole nature. The waters of holy baptism were scarce yet dry on the head of Cecilia. and Kate had stood by her during the ceremony! No words escaped the lips of either. Their hearts prayed in unison, and the prayer was all of thankfulness to God and His Mother, whose name Cecilia had chosen that morning with her own. Just as the priest ascends the altar steps, a burst o light like a stream of liquid gold, pours through the stained glass window over the altar, and bathes the place with a softened radiance like a nimbus of celestial glory. Then there arose from the choir a soft strain of deli- cious music, as light as the breath of angels, an exquis- ite harmony which made the words, Gloria in excelsis Deo, seem to float in air, and repeat themselves as if the voices that uttered them in dulcet cadences were too feint to give them force to carry them away. This was the fullest realization of human art applied to the worship of God. The harp tones that mixed with the singers' notes gave the music its last touch of beauty. Be it remembered, that Mount Benedict stood foremost of all the educational establishments in Massachusetts; and that, among the accomplishments taught in that   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      165 sanctuary of learning, vocal and instrumental music occupied a high position. Children of tender years came there from the sunny South, like young pilgrims to the fountain of knowledge, where the Virtues kept watch and ward during their stay, and sent them away refreshed with the. plenitude of a Christian education. It is not to be wondered at, if Mary Cecilia Morton felt her soul ravished with a delight she had never experienced before. Every thought which had entered her mind on the day she first passed the portal of the Convent chapel, came back to memory with particular vividness, and called up reflections which ended in prayer. Kate, too, at that moment, could not help reverting to the same happy evening when she had entered the place, in company with' Cecilia. She had had many trials and discomforts to bear and suffer; but what of them all now? They were past and gone, and, behold! here was the fruit of patience and resignation! At a signal from the silver bell, Mary Cecilia Morton and Kate Crolly, in company with all the nuns of the establishment, approached the altar most reverently. .  Cecilia has made her first communion. When Mass was over, Father Byrne, Kate and Cecilia were entertained at breakfast by the good Nuns. Many and hearty were the congratulations offered to Cecilia, and, by the kind permission of the Mother Superior, our friend Biddy was permitted to shake hands with Cecilia. As usual, Biddy, the warm-hearted, overstepped the liberty accorded her, and kissed Cecilia with evident emotion. "; An' sure, my lady's more nor common, this good day-that's what she is." 'And isn't Biddy beyond the ' common,' to-day?" asked Father Byrne, who ahd known Biddy long and favorably.  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7146-00000096"/> 166      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "Yes, your reverence; I always feel happy, Glory be to God, when our Lady Mother gives me permission to be present in the Convent Chapel-God bless her." "I think she was well entitled to allow you, of all others, to be present on this occasion, Biddy, knowing, as we all do of your gallant conduct in behalf of Miss Morton," said the priest. "Oh! don't mention anything that the likes of poor me could do. It was God, sure, that helped me, weak mortal that I am; but we won't think of these things just now, your reverence. The past is gone, thanks be to God, and who knows but our sufferings and terrors that night was the thorny path that led the young lady to where she was this morning. Oh! God's ways are 'scrutable," added Biddy, who possessed a wonderful knack in tracing sufferings as a prelude to the enjoy- ment of great blessings afterward. That was a happy party in the breakfast room of the convent that morning. What a pity that the murderous designs of intolerant ruffianism and bigotry, and the thievish propensities of others whose dissolute lives led them to live on success- ful robberies, should ever have been permitted to enter that paradise of innocence, and befoul the sacred pre- cincts with their foul presence. Yet so it was, as the sad sequel of this story will show. A deed of shame was made to stain and blast the character of the State of Massachusetts. And that stain has never yet been wiped away I!

T HE conversion of Cecilia Morton became soon known to her aunt and uncle. During her preparation for that important event., Ce- cilia and Kate had removed from Mr. Morton's and taken up their abode with an elderly Catholic lady, in Charlestown, recommended by Father Byrne, who had good reason to know that Cecilia's preparation for the reception of the holy Sacraments could not well be con- ducted under the same roof with her aunt. From the moment Cecilia had taken her departure, her aunt's rage was boundless. She ascribed all that had happened to the influence of Kate Crolly, and was loud in the expression of her anger against that poor girl. "I tell you what it is, sir," she said, addressing her distressed husband; "you are the guardian of your niece, and you can easily bring round that old doting fool, Thompson, to assist you; and I command you to go about the busines this very day, and by legal pro- cess force that girl back to her home. I shall take good care that the young seducer, Crolly, never enters this house again. You have already dipped your fingers into Cecilia's money to the depth of four thousand dol- lars.

"; Go on," said Alvah Morton, coldly. "Go you on, sir. You will find several of our good and wise Selectmen to assist you. I have only got to unburden my bosom to our friends, and point out to them that Cecilia Morton has become a Papist, in order to fire their hearts in the service of the Lord, and they will soon make the trumped-up baggage of priestcraft be glad to return, sir, to the home she has deserted." "Take my advice, and-don't." "Oh! ye vile monster! Go, I say, or I shall go mad, stark, staring mad." "Take my advice, and-don't." "Dastard, hypocrite, knave, thief, rll Scorch your eyes out." "Take my advice, and-don't." Mrs. Morton flung herself into a chair. Her breast was heaving with something stronger than maternal affection. She was simply in one of her outrageous moods, aggravated to a pitch beyond anything she had exhibited before. The cool appearance of her husband added fire to her burning breast, and caused her a heav- ier affliction of spirit than she had ever been doomed to experience during life. Alvah Morton saw all this, and he felt gratified beyond measure. He was too painfully aware that his wife had contracted debts, in order to supply the wants of a profligate son. He knew that her heart was set on the illegal acquisition of his niece's fortune, and for that reason would not have scrupled at the perpetration of the foulest. crimes 'known to the worst of mankind. He knew the guilt of his own acts, but inwardly thanked Heaven that he had been saved' from the fulfilment of his cruel- designs towards a weak   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      169 and unoffending child, whom he was bound by every law to save and protect. With such thoughts as these, Alvah Morton looked then on the exasperated state of his wife with a coolness of demeanor that almost astonished himself. "You have made up your mind to do nothing in this case, I suppose, sir-not even to screen your own guilt?" "I have made up my mind, madam, to do nothing further that is wrong. Nay, more-.and pay attention to what I say-I shall endeavor to atone for the evil that is past, and if you dare-observe my words, now-to take act or part in anything injurious to Cecilia Morton, by heavens, at every risk of disgrace, and scandal, and punishment, I shall reveal the whole of the devilish de. sign, concocted by you and executed by myself, even were I to be hanged for it." Mrs. Morton was as pale as death. Her husband had struck the right chord when he ventured to swear ex- posure. But all this was most unaccountable to Mrs. Morton. The Slave of the Lamp was never more subservient to another's will than was Alvah Morton to his wife. How to account for the extraordinary change that had thus come over her husband was the problem for which Mrs. Morton could find no solution-no, not even in her active brain. To say she was overpowered and bewil- dered would poorly express the astonishment she ex- perienced. A thousand reasons offered themselves to her mind, which were rejected as fast as they came. What if Cecilia and he were secretly engaged in defeat- ing her? She believed that at one time he had been a Papist himself; but of this she was not certain. What if he and Kate Crolly were in league together! Ah! there was something in that view of the question. The young Irish Rlopish baggage was a fox in she p's cloth- ing. She was fit for anything.

There was nothing for it but to candidly acknowledge that some spark of conscience remained in the man's breast after all. "O  if I could only know that for certain, and find out where the spark lay concealed, wouldn't I soon ex- tinguished it for him. Conscience, indeed!" "Alvah, dear, I am sick-sick unto death! You language sadly perplexes me, and puts me into a state of mind which I cannot describe. I see danger around us on every side, and I, your poor counsellor, your poor heart-broken wife, would fain avert that danger if I could. I admire your conscience, dear, after all; for with all our human frailties we must some time or an- other turn our eyes inwardly on ourselves, and examine. Yes, dear, we must examine, and, after all, I am bet- ter pleased, now that I reflect upon it, that Cecilia has betaken herself from this place. If the report be true, that she has, or is about to join the Scarlet Lady, what more natural than that your outraged feelings, and my own, and our son's, should be too great to tolerate such an inmate, such an ingrate, and such a serpent in the house of God-fearing people?" Alvah Morton was strongly moved at the first words of these last remarks of his wife's. He was on the very point of yielding again to her will, but the concluding touch restored him to full possession of his senses, and brought back the old bitterness which was now standino to him in the place of virtue. "God fearing devils!" exclaimed the husband, spring- ing to his feet, as if unable to control his feelings of in- dignation longer. "' I tell you, woman, that you are filled to the throat with hypocrisy.

"No, madam!" sneered the husband, 4" but I intend to reinstate myself in my proper position as head of this house!" "Take my advice, and-don't!" was the only reply vouchsafed. Alvah Morton was stung to the quick by this retort. If he had one weakness greater than another, it was to apply to him language used by himself in what he con- sidered a tone of successful banter or sarcasm. "Time will show whether I intend to act as I have said, and remember this,^ he slowly repeated: "God's vengeance will overtake you, Madam, sooner or later, as a punishment to your guilty heart!" saying which he retired, but not until his ears were greeted with a demoniacal laugh of scorn, the sounds of which con- tinued to reach him some minutes after his departure.

AN UNEXPECTED MEETING BETlWEEN KATE AND HER BROTHER-A LAUGH AT CECILIA MORTON'S EXPENSE CONCERNING HER VOCATION IN LIFE. "Soon as the sun's broad flame Was formed, so soon the clear light filled the air; Yet was not till he came: So love springs up in noble hearts, and there Has its appointed space, As heat in the bright flame finds its allotted place." IT would be very little, if any exaggeration, to state that few mortals ever enjoyed such pure and unalloyed happiness as Kate Crolly and Cecilia Morton. Several causes transpired to produce this enviable state of things, but, as may easily be surmised, the new life upon which Cecilia had 6te'ly entered, and the closer relationship and affectionthetween her and Kate consequent on that new  state, tended very largely, to produce this happiness. There is probably no purer or sincerer joy experienced than that enjoyed by those whose dear friend or friends have, by virtue of divine grace, entered the infallible church of the One Fold. We know of none, unless it be that still greater joy experienced by an Irish wife, in the full and unexpected conversion of her husband. Mixed marriages are doubtless often a great scandal, and entail great misery as the penalty due to such unions, never speaking of the graver dangers which usually happen to families born of such unions. Never- theless, there are many instances where the vhitue and   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       173 religious practices of a good Irish wife have resulted in the conversion of the husband, and only in such  } instances can there be found a parallel for the joy experienced by Kate Crolly in the beautiful conversion of Cecilia. Kate Was a strong believer in the doctrine that great good often springs from that which at first sight often- times appears to be incurably bad. For instance, she looked upon the attempted abduction of Cecilia, and the indignities which she suffered during, that event, as the means of drawing her closer to God. Then, again, the tender kindness bestowed- upon her in her wretched condition by the good Nuns of Mount Benedict, appeared to Kate's mind as still further aids in the good work lately consummated. Belioving these things, Kate lost no opportunity in Tfipressing on Cecilia's mind the great value of trying, as best one can, to convert evils and mishaps into blessings. "Everything that happens," maintained Kate, in a conversation with her companion, "is permissible by God; the good is ordained by Him, and the evil per- mitted, for some wise and inscrutable design, unseen by us short-sighted mortals." "But, by carrying out this theory, might it not appear that God was the author of sin?" innocently inquired Cecilia. "Nothing of the kind," sharply answered Kate. "Good is the antithesis of evil, and the author of the one cannot be the author of the other, for it is incom- patible with His very essence," and- Kate looked then very like one disposed to combat all opposition contrary to her theory. Cecilia laughed heartily at Kate's earnest appearance, and informed her that she had nothing to fear, at least from her.  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7146-00000100"/> 174      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, When we speak of the good feeling and almost holy friendship which existed between those girls, it must not be inferred that the spirit of unity exercised such a spell over them as to prevent the slightest disagreement or difference of opinion. It was in their well regulated hearts that unity existed, much more than in their outward actions and words. In the latter, they were just like the commonest of mortals, and often twitted each other not a little on things of the commonest kind. "Now that you're a good Catholic Christian, Cecilia, I suppose you'll never stop until you found a Nunnery and become a Mother Superior yourself," said Kate, half in fun, but in reality to learn a little of Cecilia's mind as to her future life. "I should dearly like to be all that you could desire me to be, Kate; but you must know, sweet monitress, that in such things as you speak of we are not the best judges of what order of life is best suited for us." "I feel that you are paying me back with interest, Ce- cilia." "The very thing I intended. How often has Kate Crolly instructed me to the effect that a religious life re- quires a vocation as one of the most essential requisites." "True, indeed, Cecilia," answered Kate Crolly. "I have often told you so, and I repeat it again. But do you not think yourself that you have a vocation for the, cloister?" 4"I have tried hard to determine that very point and have failed. Sometimes I imagine it to be presumptuous in me to be so anxious to know about myself so soon. after the changes God has so bountifully wrought in me." "I consider your remarks wise and well put, Cecilia. But did you never seek the assistance of Father Byrne?" "Once only, and got a good hearty laugh in return for my pains."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      175 "How was that?" "Oh, bother! I'll tell you some time again." "But, come, Cecilia; now is the best time to satisfy my curiosity." "Well, he burst out laughing at me, as I have said, and then told me I was much more likely to become a candidate for Hymen than a novice in a Nunnery." It was now Kate's time to laugh, till the tears almost blinded her. The thought that Cecilia's investigation of her own mind should take such a turn as that, upset her; and that Father Byrne should, of all others, turn it into such a channel, so tickled the risibilities of Kate that she really enjoyed the dismayed looks of her com- panion. "I knew you only wanted a cause for mirth," said Ce- cilia, while her own face clearly indicated that she had caught the contagion of Kate. "But I can't help it," laughed the latter. "Of course not. so said Father Byrne," and both girls joined together in a hearty peal of laughter. "Some one has been pronouncing my name," said a strange voice, as a gentleman entered, accompanied by another, who kept a little in the background and was almost unnoticed by the two girls in their attention to the priest. "Miss Crolly and Miss Morton permit me the pleasure of introducing you to my friend-" and before the priest had time to mention a name Kate's eyes were bent upon the floor, while Cecilia came forward and offered both her hands, saying at the same time; "Oh! how shall I offer my thanks, my everlasting thanks to you, dear sir, for all your goodness. Kate, dear sister, this is the gentleman who aided me, who rescued me on that dreadful night." Kate made a low curtsey, and added her thanks to those of Cecilia, in a mamnner that must have touched the stranger's heart.  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7146-00000101"/> 176      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "I am rejoiced beyond measure that my steps were so directed asto be enabled in any way to render as- sistance to a lady while in the toils of such villains." "It was a gallant action, sir," said Kate, with much fervor; "the action of a true gentleman, and carried within itself, I hope, its own reward." "Right well said," replied Father Byrne. "A word with you fort a few moments, Miss Morton," he added, and both retired. Kate Crolly and the strange gentleman were thus left alone, and Kate felt very uneasy, more especially as her modesty had forbidden her to look the gentlemen straight in the face. Not so with the stranger. He eyed Kate in the most, scrutinizing manner. Neither had spoken, and the si- lence was exceedingly painful to Kate, as she believed it might be interpreted into rudeness on her part. She desired to speak, but did not wish to refer further to the event she had already spoken of, if she could help it. There was no other topic presented itself to her mind just then, and so, with a great effort, Kate managed to speak of Miss Morton's grateful recollection of the ser- vices rendered to her. "A decent, poor woman, was really of as much ser- vice to the young lady as I," slowly repeated the stranger. Kate's pale face assumed an air of sadness. Her heart was throbbing, and it was evident that she was trying to master some emotion. The stranger noticed it, and his face was also much changed from the time he had entered the room. w Another pause ensued, and Kate felt that the eyes of the stranger were fastened upon her. He approached her, and, laying his hand upon her shoulder, said: Is it possible that Kate Crolly cannot recognize an old friend from Ireland?" "Pardon me, sir," said Kate rising to her feet, " you   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      1" have an advantage I do not possess, otherwise--" and Kate gave a sudden look upward only to behold tears springing from the eyes of the gentleman beside her. She made a backward movement, as if to reassure her- self, and then with the exclamation-"Another prayer granted-my dear, dear brotherrPatrick!"fell into that brother's arms. "Just so-just so," said Father Byrne, laughingly, as he entered with Miss Morton. "No vocation whatever, I tell you-why, how is this?" he asked, looking bewild- ered-like at the situation of Kate and the stranger. "Oh! my dear Father, heaven is truly kind to your poor penitent to-day," said Kate, as she flung herself at the feet of the good priest; " my long-lost brother is re- stored to me. Oh! little did I ever dream of such un- bounded happiness!" "Rise, my good child," said Father Byrne. "For over a fortnight I have observed this gentleman around in these parts. Fortunately, lhe called upon me to-day, and made known his mission. I told him it was surely heaven that directed his steps to me, as I was just the very person that could assist him to the fulfilment of his self-appointed mission. . Having learned so much, it was impossible to restrain him, and so I had to leave for here at once. The ways of God are indeed wondrously strange. By your good example, Kate, your friend Ce- cilia, acting in conformity with the workings of grace- too often, alas 1 rejected by more worldly-minded crea- tures-has arrived at a close, and, I trust, enduring friendship with Heaven. On the other hand, she owes her preservation, in an almost miraculous manner, to your gallant brother. Truly, you have all a good right to be thankful." Saying which, Father Byrne seated himself, and informed Cecilia that he intended, in the face of all these things, to lengthen his visit with Mr. Crolly over the time he had intended. 12  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7146-00000102"/> 178      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPTER X X K. A MEETING OF CONSPIRATORS AGAINST THE CONVENT OF MOUNT BENEDICT-ACCOUNT OF THEIR SUCC1-I3 AND HOW IT WAS ATTAINED. "Aim your lightnings At the oaken, Massive, iron-studden portals t Sack the house of God, and scatter Wide the ashes of the dead." ACCORDING to previous arrangement, a meeting of the conspirators against the Convent was held in the old school-house on the same evening which witnessed the happy re-union of Kate and her brother. While Father Byrne was the life of the party at Ce- cilia's, and contributed to scatter joy around him on all sides, there were others of whom he was totally igno- rant plotting against the sanctity of the place of which he was th9 beloved chaplain. Keeley had progressed so far in his evil designs as to eclipse the efforts of Harry Buck, and the scoundrel felt satisfied at his successes. A large gathering of brick-makers had been brought for that evening from New Hampshire, and as many of the loose and daring characters of Boston, Cambridge, and Charlestown, as could be depended on, were also gathered together for the purpose of inflaming their bigotry and their passion for plunder. The original workers, the Buzzards, Keeley, Craze, and Buck, together with Fishy Pond, "David Dodge," and one or two other choice spirits, formed a sort of inner ring, to whose counsels the others were not admitted,   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       179 These worthies held a preparatory meeting in Keeley's house previous to entering on business with the general body, in Cutter's old school-house. Keeley was d-d if they did'nt swear in the whole crowd, that ugly work was sure to become of the whole business. "Right, Keeley," was Harry Buck's response, and the speaker bore such a look, that it produced the opposite effect of pleasing Keeley, as intended. The latter could not, if then called upon, explain why his mind was sud- denly embittered towards Buck; but he felt it, neverthe- less, and was not slow in giving Buck one or two re- minders of the fate which should overtake all blabbers on the business then on hand. "That's right again, I say," reiterated Mr. Buck. "Death to everyone as blabs on this ere bizziness. We are men as knows exactly how to do our work, and un- derstands the ins and outs of the whole of it. We runs risks for sartin, and so will take care that those as runs these risks shan't have any sly-waggers among us, not if we knows it." Both the Bfzzards and others present delivered themselves in like fashion, and, after taking several pulls of whiskey from a huge black bottle, started forth in twos and threes for the general rendezvous. When they reached the school-room, over forty men had arrived. As on the previous occasion, the place was only dimly lighted, and, by the secret orders of some of those who composed the chief ring, there was a plentiful supply of drink, which seemed to please the strangers very much, and prepare them for the ready undertaking of any daring act of violence. By pre-arrangement, Fishy Pond was appointed the first speaker, and it was further arranged that during his remarks the others comprising the ring should move around among the men, and learn their sentiments and their determination.

After a liberal distribution of liquor, Fishy Pond arose to address his " comrades." He commenced by informing them that that was not the first meeting of the kind that had been held, "There had been several held before in different places, chiefly in the house of their friend Mr. Keeley (' damn you, tor an ass!' from Keeley). A friend, he would call him, who had an op- portunity better'n any man there of seeing how things were carried through at that blarsted Nunnery, where poor girls were entrapped against the constitootion of Massachusetts, and kept there until their hair turned gray! (sensation). I, for one, am in a position to prove that a friend of my own, that is, of a friend's-you all know, probably, that I refer to 'Becca Reed -who was kept in a dungeon in that Nunnery, on bread and water, till she made her escape, and she would have been dead and in her grave before now if she hadn't escaped. That's the truth! Well, now, seein' as that's the truth (ahem!) are we to stand here and see our sis- ters and female acquaintances immured, and us to do nothing but let the Papishes and Roman Babylons, as I calls 'em, ride rough-shod over this ere community? doud cries of 'No, no.') Are we to see them hypo- crites skulkin' about in their black gowns doin' nothin' but pullin' flowers, and givin' them to priests to deck their Popish altars with?" (cries of ' Never I never! down with 'em! burn out the rookery!') And what's worse nor all, jist two weeks ago a injured female ran out o' that Nunnery half naked, and flew; yes, I say, flew, for her bare life, till she reached Boss Cutter's house, where she fainted, and when she come-to again, looked wildly around her, and thinking she was still pursued by the black women-I mean them ones in   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       181 black-darted out, and was pursuin' an unknown dray when she was caught. She hollered like death for help, but there was no help at hand, and so she was dragged back by the hair of the head-and whether she is now living or dead, I don't know."' Loud execrations followed this fanciful picture, when a man, in the garb of a brick-maker, rose up and bawled forth: i"We can take in a good, long yarn, Mr. Pond- excuse me for interruptin', you know-but that's too much of a good thing, even for the best of us." "I swear to Heaven it is every word true!" shouted Pond, fearful of losing the impression his rascally fancy had created. "Swear to hell if you like; but I know it ain't true. Some on it is true; but some of us know all about 'Becca Reed. She's a good 'un, and never got a dollar for her work. Oh, no; and some of us know-I, for one, know -that the lady who called on Boss Cutter was a little touched up here," and the speaker pointed to the top of his head to indicate his meaning. ' Friends, do you hear that :" vociferated Pond. "The lady was driven mad. (' That's so-that's so,' was the general cry.) And with this evidence staring us in the face, we presume to call ourselves men and permit this abomination to live before our faces. But worse fol- lows. There's another lady, the niece of a respectable citizen, in that Nunnery; taken there against her will; kept there in irons till she becomes a Papist through fear. Now this lady is a rich lady, and she has offered thousands of dollars to get her liberty, but she is only laughed at for her pains. A priest caused her to be smuggled into that devil's place, and there's no redress." "Why don't her friends interfere, and call upon the Justices and the Selectmen to enforce the law?" in- quired the peaker who had interrupted Pond before.  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7146-00000104"/> 182     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "So they have," shouted Fishy Pond; but the lady is denied, while her friends know her to be there." "Gammon, gammon," repeated the dissatisfied au- ditor. "It's no gammon," roared out "David Dodge."' "I know it to be true, and the lady is a friend of my own." "Name her," was the next demand. "Her name is Miss Morton, and she is my cousin." "Oh, you go be hanged! I saw Miss Morton this morning, when I was a-goin' to work. I knows the lady as you refers to," was the unpleasant rejoinder of the disputant. "You're a liar, a d-d liar! I don't care who you are," shouted ", David Dodge," in a fit of passion, which caused him to froth at the mouth. The man thus ad- dressed arose and slowly approached Mr. Dodge, with- out the slightest hindrance on the part of any present. He was a powerfully built man, exceedingly rough in appearance, but with a horrible, determined-looking aspect. "Look you here, friend David," he said, grasping that individual by the arm. "You keep liars, and all such talk, for others like yourself. Use them words again, and I'll make you swallow them quicker nor you ever swallowed pap when you were a baby. You hear now." Mr. "David Dodoe" endeavored to laugh, but only succeeded in getting out a very sickly smile. He offered his hand, but the last speaker only stuck his fist deep down in the pocket of his pants. "David Dodge," or, as he was sometimes called by way of familiarity, Davie, took possession of a seat, as if to watel. the effect of the conduct of his interrupt- er on the audience. He did think that his fervor aggainst the Nunnery should have raised up for him at least a dozen of men to swear by every word he had uttered.

"We know what the Nunnery is, arid so there's :n. use in Mr. Pond and his friend Dodge tryin' it on over the likes of us. As I understands the game, there is somethirng to be earned by this work (hear, hear), and, like mnen, we mean to go into it right away. There's a lot on us here as wishes to know what's to be had-if anything--and, if so, whose to pay? That's what I calls work."' "I'll give fifty dollars to the first man as enters the d-d Nunnery!" exclaimed Jack Buzzard. "Not as I1 am any way interested, but for the rights of liberty." "And I'll give fifty more to the first who sets a good blazing brand right in the middle of that den!" cried out Harry Craze. "Fifty dollars ain't much for a fellow's neck, after all!" said one to another, in an under tone. Keeley's sharp ear caught the remark, and a new in- spiration'seemed to have been given him by the pow- ers of evil. Springing to his feet, he demanded to be heard in the " good cause in which they one and all felt interested." The chairman gave permission, and asked for order to hear friend Keeley. "Seein', sir, as but one opinion prevails among us brothers, here to-night, and in order to bring this part of our business to a close, I move that every man present here be solemnly sworn to keep secret all that has transpired, and that each one binds himself to be present on the grounds of the Nunnery on next Monday 1ight, August 11th, 1834, to do and to act as it seemeth best to him.

Now, in view of this fact, we pledge ourselves, before Heaven and in presence of each other, to root out the cause of this slavery; and seeing and knowing, as we do, that people are deprived of their liberty in these Convents, we shall take an early op- portunity of judging for ourselves, and take such measures afterwards as shall seem good and proper for us to take, in order to rid ourselves, in all time coming, of the hateful presence of Priests and Nunneries-So help us God.'" At mention of the last solemn words, every man in that assembly rose to his feet. and swoie to "uproot all Nunneries out of America." Some one had opened the old creaky door, and a gust of wind soon left the semi-intoxicated creatures in the dark. 'Twas an awful moment! Behold those demons- almost utterly unconscious of the act they had per- formed, swearing and cursing at things they knew not of-staggering forth in the middle of a pleasant night, breathing vengeance against those who never did them harm; swollen with rage and undefined bigotry, led  i by the cunning of a few into the perpetration of the most wicked schemes-and for what? To gratify their brutal passions against those who knew not of their ex- istence, and whose chief duty in life consisted in pray- ing for poor sinners led astray by the genius of evil. Thus is it ever with the world! The persecuted con- stantly beseeching Heaven for blessings on the worst of mankind, and the latter engaged in the secret service of the devil, to supplant the good and the virtuous, whose lives are a terrible lesson to the bigot and to the viciously inclined.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       185 CHAPTER xX . THE SELECTMEN OF CHARLESTOWN- VISIT THE CON- VENT-INTERVIEW WITH THE LADY SUPERIOR. "Hail I then hail to you all I To the heirdoom of Heaven be ye welcome." NEXT day, after Father Byrne and Patrick Crolly had taken their departure from Kate and Cecilia, the sun rose with unwonted splendor in the blue vault above. The glorious Indian Summer had dawned in the pleasant State of old Massachusetts. The air was balm- laden with the dying sweets of the Fall. Nature en- joyed as it were a kind of loving repose after its great exertion in bringing forth the fruits of the earth for man. Earth and sea and sky were alike at peace, and naught was heard but the mystic sound of the forest leaves. Odorous incense arose from the bruised leaves of flowers, and this bespoke an immortality even of those small things -in nature. Spring and summer would revive those gentle things of nature after the rottenness of winter had passed away. The life-giving germ re- mained within them while divested of every sign of life. Other suns would call forth new springs of life, and give to every floweret the means of resuscitation. Such a day was well calculated to inspire the minds of Kate Crolly and Cecilia Morton with thoughts beyond the transient things of life. "It is possible, dear Kate, I suppose, that when the heart is happy and at rest, that nature in its ordinary and seasonable beauty appears richer and lovelier to our senses."  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7146-00000106"/> 186      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,  "There can be no doubt, Cecilia, that under such circumstances as you contemplate a sweet and blessed unison springs up between the calm and unruffled mind and the well ordered harmony of nature. To a poor mortal like myself, having experienced such wonder- ful joy on yesterday, and beholding those lovely, quiet scenes, and the bright golden-colored sky, I feel as if the great Creator of the universe had vouchsafed bless- ings too many and too great to us poor sinful mortals." "I feel, somehow, doubly anxious to pay a visit to the oratory at Mount Benedict to-day," said Cecilia. What say you to a walk for that purpose?" "That you have just. anticipated me," was the response. "How do you account for it," asked Cecilia, "that I still neglected to have a conversation with you, Kate, concerning the gentleman who now turns out to be your brother. Oftentimes and again had I determined to speak to you as to his general appearance, as far as my poor memory servedme at the time, and yet some- thing happened or intervened at the moment so as to prevent me." "It is somewhat singular, but I attach no importance to it now, especially when affairs have taken the turn they have." "Hist! By Heaven's there's Miss Morton, after all the run we had last night. That bummer was right, then," said Rat Keeley, who, with his friend Harry Craze, had been dodging around the grounds of Mount Benedict, and had suddenly discovered Cecilia and Sate, arm-in-arm. The men were partly concealed in the shrubbery, and were unnoticed by the young ladies. "I sometimes feel glad as how Buzzard didn't man- age that bizziness, after all," remarked Craze.   TNE VIOLATED TOMB.      187 "Well; I don't know. He'd a gotten a lot of dollars, but how he'd have divided the spoil I ain't so sure on. Now he be a blarsted cuss, that same young Morton. lHe told only yesterday, as to .how his coz was in that Nunnery, for sartin; and swore an oath as would have startled even me - only I knows the kid - that she warn't in her own house-no, not in two weeks agone." "I suppose he jawed Pond into the belief that she were in the Nunnery, too." "Not a bit on't. That Pond knows right well what he's about. 'Becca Reed has given him all the inform- ation where the head Lady keeps her money, and where the valuables are. Do you think Master Pond goes in for work as he talked last night?" asked Keeley, with a look and accent which plainly meant, If you do, you're much greener than any one ever took you to be. "I think nothin' of the sort" replied Ciaze. "I, guess he's in for a bit of plunder, as well as some oth- ers of us; but he did a good thing in getting the brick- makers to believe it was all for liberty to the impris- oned females that they were called upon to work." "That was the best point of the whole; and if there's a good fire in the case, most people can't tell whether things is lost, carried away, or destroyed," quietly re- marked Keeley. The hints contained in these words were not lost on the attentive Mr. Craze. "But don't you think, now, that Mr. Pond should just take one or two of us into his confidence, and let us honorably divide the swag?" asked Craze, by way of a feeler. "No," was the abrupt answer. "He would deceive his father under such circumstances. I know the boy. The best plan to follow is to keep a sharp look out for him on that night. It will be dark before the work is right under way, and let you keep near to me.

At the right moment, we can pounce upon him-by accident, you understand-and then give him some help. You're clear, are you?" "Ha, ha! Well done, Rat! Why I is as clear as thunder," was the ambiguous reply of Mr. Craze, as he slapped his companion on the shoulder, by way of en- forcing his clear-sightedness. Just as Kate and Ceeclia had left the oratory, they encountered two strange gentlemen in what appeared to them like an altercation with the Lady Superior. One of the gentlemen produced a newspaper with a notice concerning a young lady, who, it was alleged, was de- tained in the establishment against her will. "We are not responsible for the stories and inven. tions of newspapers," replied the Lady Superior, who appeared to look upon the gentlemen's presence as an intrusion. "Is the lady in question present; and can she be seen??" inquired one of the visitors. Kate made a movement as if to leave, but was pre- vented from so doing by Cecilia, who whispered to her: Don't stir. I know both of these gentlemen-one of them is a great favorite with Aunt, and is consequently rather a dangerous personage." "'The lady you refer to is Sister Mary St. John, who has been ill with brain fever, and is not yet perfectly re- covered. She 1is still very nervous, and would feel much annoyed, I am sure, at being subjected to inspection by those who have no right to annoy her," was the calm and dignified reply of the Superior. ' Miss Harrison, I understand, is the name of the lady, " said one of the visitors.. "The same. That is- her worldly name, but Sister St. John is her conventual name.",   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       189 "Why change the lady's name,' was the next imper- tinent query. Is it for the purpose of examining me in matters re- lating to our practices and observances that I am in- debted for the honor of this visit by you to-day?" asked the Lady Superior, with a visible color of displeasure in the tone of her voice. "It is our duty, Madam, to investigate the circum- stances connected with the 'Mysterious Lady,' of whom we have heard strange accounts,"' was the reply. "Then I am to understand, gentlemen, that you are here in your official capacity." "Officially, yes; but not deputed by our brothers, the Selectmen." "Then I tender your body an invitation to come here to-morrow, and examine everything for themselves." The two gentlemanly visitors looked at each other, as much as to say, Shall we accept the invitation; or is this only a Nun's ruse to get quit of us, in order that the place may be put in order meantime, and that the mys- terious lady may be removed or properly instructed to act a part assigned her?"' Madame St. George at once comprehended the mean- ing of this look, and at the same time properly inter- preted the minds of both gentlemen. "Or, should it please you better," sheladded with significance, " one of you may remain here, while the other goes to summon the whole of your body." Such a candid invitation was not without its value, and the Lady Superior's offer was about being accepted, when three other gentlemen made their appearance. Kate and Cecilia approached the Mother Superior, and asked if they should retire, or remain as they were? "Remain, my children,"' was the kind answer; 1' your presence gives me strength." Hurriedly, and in a whisper, Cecilia told her what she knew of one, at least, of the strangers present.  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7146-00000108"/> 190      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, After mutual explanations were made between those who had first arrived at the Convent, and those who followed, one of the gentlemen who came first, a Mr. Hooper, informed the others of the very fair offer made by the Superior. This seemed to please the others much; one of whom, Mr. Stephen Wiley, desired to know if the Superior could satisfy them that the rumors lately circulated were false. flie Lady Superior at once assented, and gave orders for the immediate attendance of Sister St. John. That young lady shortly after appeared, but became quite nervous when she understood the mission of the gentle- men present. She at once acknowledged having left the Convent about a month previous to that date, but she candidly confessed that she was instigated to the act by her nervous state of body and weakened mind, arising from a bad fever, induced in part, she believed, by the smell of paint in some of the rooms of the Convent, but chiefly from too early a resumption of her duties as musical teacher. "Then, you must have been compelled to resume your duties before your health was fully restored?" inquired Mr. Hooper. - "n the contrary, sir, I was forbidden; but the ihn- portunities of my pupils, all of whom are very fond of me, induced me privately to disobey my orders; but I have paid the penalty of my disobedience." "Have you any objection, Madam," asked Selectman Wiley, " that we should satisfy ourselves of the order of your establishment by a personal inspection?" "  Not only have I no objection, but it is the earnest desire of our good Bishop, the Chaplain of the Convent, and it is my own desire that you should fully satisfy yourselves by a minute inspection, and Sister St. John will be able, I hope, to conduct you through the house herself."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       191 Miss Harrison consented, and forthwith led the way for the Selectmen. ( The inspection was of the minutest character, and i fully satisfied those who came there for that purpose. Meantime, all sort of rumors were circulated outside, to the effect that the Selectmen dare not make known the truth of their visit publicly. The Rev. Alvah Morton had somehow procured access to one or two of the newspapers, and, at his instigation, induced, on the other hand, by the instiga- tion of his pious mother, procured the insertion of paragraphs intended to inflame the public mind against the Convent.  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7146-00000109"/> 192      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPTER x X x 1. THE NUNS OF MOUNT BENEDICT AT THE MERCY OF THE AUTHORITIES-DERELICTION OF DUTY ON THE PART OF THE LATTER. O, fear not in a world like this, And thou shalt know ere long,- Know how sublime a thing it is To suffer and be strong:., RUMORS concerning the convent were now matters of hourly occurrence. Those who were acting as the se- cret agents of the conspiracy were busy at work, and as they proceeded with their hellishy concocted designs, respectable people, whose prejudices against the Catho- lics, and particularly against conventual institutions, who had been heretofore held in abeyance, were now foremost in their denunciations against Mount Benedict. The Selectmen endeavored to appease the public mind by issuing the following card :-- "To THE PUBLIC: Whereas. erroneous statements have ap- peared in the public papers, intimating that the liberty of a young lady was improperly and unlawfully restrained at the Convent in this town, and believing that said publications were intended to excite the public mind against that institu- tion, and might result in unpleasant or serious consequences, the Selectmen, considering it their duty to endeavor to allay any such excitement, have, at the request of the government of the institution, fully exainiaed into the circumstances of the case, and were conducted by the lady in question through- out the premises, and into every apartment of the place, the whole of which is in, good order, and nothing appearing to them to be in the least objectionable; and they have the sat- isfaction to assure the public that there exists no cause of   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       193 complaint on the part of said female, as she expresses herself to be entirely satisfied with her present situation, it being that of her own choice, and that she has no desire or wish to alter THOMAS HOOPER, } A BIJA MONROE, SAMUEL POOR,  Selectmen. STEPHEN WILEY, JON RUNEY,  J CHARTISTOWN, August 11, 1834. But all was of no avail. The stream of locked-up bigotry was let loose, and the people became literally frenzied. Handbills of the vilest character were issued, no one knew from what source. These were liberally distributed in Charlestown, Boston, Cambridge, Water- town, and all the immediate vicinities. Men left off their work and gathered at the corners of the streets eagerly discussing the Imaginary acts of violence perpetrated inl the Nunnery. No language was too base nor too vile for those whose bigotry and intolerance were thus awakened. The characters of the nuns, whose sole office was the performance of religious duties and the due instruction of the young ladies committed to their charge, were bit- terly assailed, and commented upon In the most atro- cious manner. The worst possible motives were as* cribed to them, while their pure lives were painted as those of concealed harlots. Rebecca Reed's book, en- titled "Six Months in a Convent," was eagerly read and criticized, even by those unfit to peruse its lying pages. During all this period of excitement it never once oc- curred to the authorities that any necessity existed for the protection of life and property at the Convent of Mount Benedict. Such a plain dereliction of duty could admit only of one interpretation, and that was, that there were those among the said authorities who quietly winked at the surging of the public passions, and cared iot in what violent manner the whole thing terminated. Their guil- 13  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7146-00000110"/> 194      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, ty quietude enabled such infamous scoundrels as the Buzzards and Keeleys to propagate whatever lies came uppermost in their minds. Those thieves, burglars, and murderers, were not slow to turn everything to their own account, and the negligence of the authorities en- abled them to perfect their plans without let or hind- rance! Harry Craze had despatched two messengers hurried- ly to New Hampshire with intelligence to send in large numbers of men; strangers to the place preferred. Provi- sion would be made for them during the "' sport." Wil- liam and John Buzzard were not idle. For the time being, those men seemed to be completely in the toils of Fishy Pond, while the latter and "David Dodge," alias, Morton, were simply puppets in the hands of Alvah Morton, Jun., and other evangelicals of a like type. It is unnecessary perhaps to observe that the Rev Alvah Morton was in complete subjection to the orders and dictates of his respected mother. Young Dr. Mor- ton was also availed of in the general ferment, and when, to these were added the individual prejudices, and open and avowed hatred, and hostility of a host of puritanical people, it will be readily understood how great was the peril and danger of the poor Nuns of the Convent of Mount Benedict, who, up to that moment had little, if any, knowledge of the great danger in which they stood. Blessed ignorance! These poor Nuns, who had forsaken the world and all its joys and temptations, in order to devote themselves to the care of their own souls, and the advancement in virtue and education of some fifty young ladies, of dif- ferent religious persuasions, placed -under their charge by parents and guardians, were the most unconcerned in all the rising tumult which was then swelling around them to the most dangerous proportions. They were innocent of all guile and guilt, and thus could scarcely   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      195 be made to believe that the Spirit of Evil could enter men's minds to their injury. Biddy, the apple-woman, was anything but a quiet spectator of the scenes around. Father Byrne, in company with Patrick Crolly, had been to the Bishop's residence, and reported what they knew of the btate of the public mind. Bishop Fenwick could not bring himself to believe that anything worse than a turbulent ebullition of mis-directed feeling was then possible. Besides, the sainted chief Pastor was just preparing a statement concerning the Convent, which he was about to publish, and which he believed would have the effect of allaying the passions of the excited mobs. Judging matters by the same standard as the Bishop, most men would have been of the same opinion, but the religious liberty be- queathed by the emigrants of the Mayflower was not precisely of that character which prevails at the present day. There was in those days liberty" granted only to think as others did, and a close scrutiny of men and manners at the present time, would show that a rem- nant of the old Adam still lingers around the good State of Massachusetts. It is but a remnant, however, and the growth of a healthier public optinion in other States sends its sweet odor even into Massachusetts, to generate in men's minds and make them conformable to the true spirit of the American Constitution.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7146-00000111"/> 196      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPTER X XX l. BIDDY'S DESPATCHES-CALMNESS OF THE MOTHER ,SUPERIOR-FINAL CONCERTED ACTION OF THE CON- SPIRATORS. "In the Convent of Drontheimj Alone in her chamber, - Knelt Astrid, the Abbess, At midnight adoring, Beseeching, entreating, The Virgin and Mother." POOR Biddy, our old friend the apple-woman, was, in those days of excitement, up in arms, and everywhere. At one time she was known to be engaged in the very easy work of rousing her countrymen to a sense of their duty, and in the next of sending some messenger to the Convent with what she termed a pretty accurate idea of the " state of the war." In such cases, Biddy's despatches were often im- proved upon by the force of her imaginative powers. She had it that all the sogers in Amerikey were comin' to destroy the poor Nuns." Her impulsive nature, how- ever, and her well knewn devotion to the Convent of Mount Benedict, were well nigh being the cause of re- taliatory measures on the part of the outraged Irish. Even Patrick Crolly was known, in more than one in- stance to exclaim, "Biddy is right, and he is no man who will not follow her advice!" More dangerous words were never uttered at that memorable period. Bishop] Fenwick, Father Byrne, and others, Irish and American, were strenuously ex- erting themselves in the cause of public order, and it required the exertion of something like- Supernatural   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      197 powers to keep the Irish element in restraint. Viewed calmly at the present day, one cannot help admiring the super-excellent wisdom of the good Bishop Fqnwick, while on the other hand we can scarcely help wishing that the bonds of restraint had been burst asunder for the purpose of teaching the bigots of Charlestown that America, originally the home of the Red man, is as free to the Irish race as to any colony of Dutch, or Eng- lish Cromwellians. Biddy had passed through the streets of Boston, and gathering all the information she could, hurried off to Charlestown, which she did in little over half an hour, for Biddy was no laggart in what she conceived to be "her bounden duty between God and man." Arrived at the Convent, she found Kate and Cecilia there before her. "Where's Mother?'; cried out Biddy, as soon as she entered. "I am here," said the Lady Superior, who had ob- served Biddy hurrying up the avenue. * There's bad blood up this good evening," hurriedly exclaimed the excited creature. "There's bad blood up, I tell yees, and the sooner you quit here, the better for you, one and all." The Lady Superior listened unmoved to the warning of Biddy. She was then surrounded by several of the Nuns, some of whom exhorted her to heed the warning of the apple-woman. ' Others of the Nuns were at their devotions, offering up their pious prayers for the benefit of the vicious and wicked.                        D "There is no danger-at least, no immediate danger" -was the assurance of the Lady Superior. "We are all unprotected females here, and, bad as the case may be, men will not surely descend to harm women and children."  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7146-00000112"/> 198     MOUNT BENEDICT, OR, Just then, one of the Sisters came in and reported, that a crowd of bad-looking men were gathering right in front of the building. Still Madame, St. George refused to believe that any- thing further than an exhibition of passion would take place. She could not bring herself to believe that an establishment devoted to educational purposes, and sup- ported and patronized by the leading Protestants and Dissenters of Boston, could suffer in any way other than by the unscrupulous and false reports of evil dis- posed people. "Then, again," she maintained, in presence of her spiritual children, " there are the authorities to protect us in case of danger. The law will be upheld, and if anything improper should take place the guilty parties will be punished. This knowledge will prevent any outrage, so that- we have nothing really to dread, after all. I advise you, therefore, dear children, to retire, attend carefully to the wants of your pupils, and on no account communicate to any of them fears or suspicions which might annoy them, and cause them uneasiness. Accept my blessing now, my dear children, and retire." Such was the simple reasoning of the good Mother Superior, who could not bring herself to believe that any real danger was at hand., Her faith in the protection of the lawful authorities was supreme, and most natural. Turning to Ceolia and Kate, she inquired with greater exactness as to the state of the public mind outside. But they were utterly ignorant of anything likely to be- come a cause of trouble or annoyance to their dear friends in the Convent. They had learned more of the threatened dangers since they came to the Convent than they could have learned by themselves outside. Besides, they saw Father Byrne, lately, and he men- tioned nothing to them. On the whole, they were strongly of opinion that the Mother Superior had taken   - THE VIOLATED, TOMB.       199 the correct view of affairs, and they both expressed an ardent hope that they had learned the worst that could happen. After an affectionate leave-taking Kate and Cecilia departed. Coming down Medford road they saw small gather- ings of rough-looking men engaged in angry debate. They quickened their steps until they reached their own dwelling, where Cecilia procured a copy of the Boston Post, and the first thing her eye alighted on was the fol- lowing letter:- To THE EDITOR OF THE BOSTON MORNING POST:-Some ex- citement having been created in this vicinity, by misrepre. sentaiTons that have come before the public, in relation to the disappearance of a young lady from the Nunnery in this place, I deem it proper for me to state certain fac^s that are in my possession respecting the affair. On the afternoon of Monday, the 28th ult., the lady in ques- tion came to my house, appeared to be considerably agitated, and expressed her wish to be conveyed to the residence of an acquaintance in West Cambridge. I lent her my assistance; and on the succeeding day I called with the purpose of inquir- ing for the causes which induced her to leave the institution. I was informed that she had returned to the Nunnery in com- pany with the Bishop, with a promise that she should be per- mitted to leave in two or three weeks, if it was her wish. Since that time various rumors have been in circulation cal- culated to excite the public mind, and to such an extent, as in- duced me to attempt to ascertain their foundation: according- ly, on Saturday, the 9th inst., I galled at the Nunnery, and re- quested of the Superior an interview with the lady referred to. I obtained it; and was informed by her that she was at liberty to leave the institution at any time she chose. The same statement was also made by the Superior, who further remarked that, in the present state of public feeling, she would prefer to have her leave. As it has been currently reported that the lady was not to be found, to allay the excitement in consequence of it, I have thought the above statement due to the public. EDWARD CUrTji. CHARLESTOWN, August 11, 184. Cecilia nervously read this letter and became deeply  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7146-00000113"/> 200      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, agitated as she proceeded. ' I know Mr. Cutter," she said to Kate, "' he is a decent gentleman, but there are those around him who are bigoted enough, and who would not scruple to raise false alarms concerning the Convent, on the strength of the little they know. Rest assured, that the visit of Sister St. John to that gentle- man's place has been taken advantage of to the detri- ment of the Convent by those whom Mr. Cutter would never suspect." Kate listened, but in reality her mind was differently occupie d than in paying as much attention to this sub- ject as Cecilia gave it. Cecilia was not very far astray in her estimate of mat- ters concerning those who surrounded Mr. Cutter. But there were other and worse agencies at work, originated chiefly, though indirectly, through Cecilia herself. Her aunt had been secretly instrumental in poisoning the mind of Prescot and Fishy Pond, and in supplying them with funds to carry out the fell designs of the con- spirators who aimed at the destruction of the Convent. William and Jack Buzzard now appeared openly on the scene, and held a consultation with Rat Keeley. In the middle of their hellish deliberations, Harry Craze made his appearance, and conveyed the information that over forty men had arrived from New Hampshire, only a few days ago. Their presence was not generally known. Some had obtained work around Boston, and others had been compelled to beat about in search for employment, but had failed. They were even then gathering id 'considerable force in different parts of the neighborhood, and their opinions concerning the "Nunnery " were just of the right stamp. It is needless to say, that Keeley and the Buzzards were delighted with the news brought them by their friend Craze. "What of Buck and-his comrades?" inquired Jack Buzzard.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       201 "I saw him this morning, but he was as drunk's a beast," answered Craze. '"He had been around with some of Cutter's men, and wherever he got the chinks, I don't know, but he had lots of dimes, and was spending them as fast as he could." "Then Buck's all right," added William Buzzard. Right well the latter knew that Buck was all right, having supplied him, the night before, with money to do the work which he, Captain William Buzzard, had been appointed to do himself. "What's the first thing to be done?" asked Craze. "The first thing to be done, friend Craze, is to see if Keeley has got in anything, to put ourselves in order. I guess he ain't such a fool as not to, and when he has discharged his dooty to his friends, we'll start right away into the bizziness of the evening, and see what we'll 4do," Keeley was not far behind time in supplying his companions with the chief thing requisite to encourage their fell designs. Jack Buzzard showed his capacity for rum in a man- ner almost to bewilder those who saw him. Keeley made two or three feints at following the example of Buzzard, but it was evident that his design was not to partake of much just then. Harry Craze watched matters closely, and could not be induced to dip as deep as Jack. He had no objection to pocket a bottle of stuff, to serve him at another time, but he maintained tihat that time was the time for work. ":Now or never," he bawled out; and as he did-so, a murmur like a half-suppressed cheer reached the ears of those present. Harry Craze rushed to the door to learn the cause, and although it was pretty dark at the time, did not fail to discern crowds of men hurrying towards the Convent.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7146-00000114"/> 202      MoIr BENEDICT; OR, Rushing in, he informed his party that a large number of their friends, with faces blackened and otherwise disguised, had just passed Cutter's house. Some had torches, and others were carrying barrels. "I sent in word to-day for twenty barrels," said William Buzzard. "They will all be required before morning, I guess," was the cool assertion of Keeley, who advised an immediate exit-singly, of course, so as to prevent any particular observation.

If He but wave His hand, The mists collect, the rains fall thick and loud  Till with a smile of light on sea and land, Lo I He looks back from the departing cloud." "Go, my dear children, back again to your dormito-. ries," was the command of the Mother Superior to a few of the elder pupils who had refrained from retiring to rest at their usual hour. They obeyed, but with tears in their eyes. They had some sort of presentiment that a cloud of danger hung over their happy home. Nor were they far astray. The crowds around the Convent continued to increase, and their boisterous character soon became apparent. Loud yells and cries, of a perfegtly hellish nature, were heard by the Nuns and pupils shortly after they had retired to rest. These cries came and went at intervals like the roar of angry waves beating against the limits of the shore. Fortunately the extent of the danger, then becoming more visible every minute, was unknown to the majority of the innocent creatures sheltered by the holy roof of the Convent. The Mother Superior paced the corridor alone. Her heart was devoted to prayer, for sake of all those under her charge. Unseen by human eyes, she prayed for and claimed the protection of God and His Immaculate  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7146-00000115"/> 204     'MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Mother for her children I She could not bring herself to believe that any serious or immediate danger was at ,hand, yet she prayed with the whole force of her soul for protection, and, as the loud yells of the unmanly crowds outside reached her ears, she redoubled her pe- titions to heaven, that come what may, the poor, dear children and the Nuns, who claimed her as a Mother, should pass unscathed through the really fiery ordeal which her intuition showed her was impending. It was a terrible hour of supremest agony for a wo- man's heart-but that heart quailed not! Again the fiendish shouts were renewed. This time they were accompanied with cries of "Down with the Nunnery! Down with the Nunnery!" The Mother Superior heard those terrible words with secret awe. Several of the Sisters rushed to her, im- ploring her to fly with them and save their lives. "Retire, and be prompt at command," was her only answer. "Guard Thy children, O God! from contact with this ruffian rabble," was her exclamation in that moment of distress. Suddenly a crowd of men, some of them on horse- back-the brothers Pond, and the brothers Buzzard, among the number-appeared right in front of the Con- vent, clamoring like demons to others behind them, to come on and sack the d-d Nunnery. The Mother Superior, imagining that the moment for final action had arrived, appeared at a window on the second sory, and. asked those below what they wanted? i We want to tear down this cussed building, that's what we want, and will tear you along with it, too!" "The Selectmen have been over this house, to-day," said the Mother Superior, " and satisfied themselves of the falsehoods lately promulgated regarding us. If you keep patient you may return to-morrow morning and   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      205 also receive admittance, so as to satisfy yourselves, like your townsmen, that no cause exists for this to us terri- ble annoyance." "Leave there, you damned old figurehead!" shouted Harry Craze; and as soon as the words were spoken, a shot was fired by an unknown hand at the 1Mother Supe- rior. The shot appeared to come from behind a willow tree, right in front of the spot where the Lady Superior stood. The Superior moved not. The bullet had deviated from its appointed mission, and she, at whose heart the aim was taken, refrained not from confronting the angry crowd beneath her. O! the majesty of innocence! Without another word being spoken, the crowd dis- persed to the extremity of the Convent grounds. "Hell and damnation," hissed Jack Buzzard through his teeth, " what are the fools about! ' "Prevent' them from -dispersing, Pond," roared out Craze, who was speedily in the midst of the uncertain multitude. Only a few minutes elapsed when a bonfire was lighted by the hand of Keeley, and around which the crowd gathered and danced like demons. That was one point gained for the fell conspirators. Some who were about to leave, returned, and the chief hands in the evil work that night were not slow in pro- I viding plenty of maddening liquor in order torestore the X I failing courage of the cowardly mob. The sight of the bonfire acted upon those maddened beings like the taste of blood upon the starved tiger in his Indian jungle. It was significant, and conveyed to the minds of the mob the very thoughts the chief con- spirators desired to convey to them. The passions of the wild mob increased as the flames of the fire rolled upward. During this exhibition of wild excitement there was  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7146-00000116"/> 200      MOUNT BENEDICT; ORB, not wanting plenty of instigation to inflame the minds of the semi-drunken men, and paint the " secret horrors of the Nunnery " in such a manner as to elicit the most obscene remarks and blasphemous language of those whose baser natures were thus successfully ministered to. Harry Craze and Keeley were as active as such devils in human shape could be. They directed and superintended the breaking and tearing down of the fences around the Convent grounds. These were used to feed the bonfire, and as each new pile of dried wood was added to the hissing flames hoarse cheers were raised, which continued from time to time to terrify the Nuns, and create a state of dread and nervousness among them worse than the wildest panic could have caused. David Morton, alias Dodge, was as busy just then as he could well be. He was distributing handbills among the crowd, and appointing parties to read them for the benefit of those who were unable to do so themselves. The following are specimens of the articles thus issued:- "TO THE SELECTMEN OF C ARIESTOWN.

Now it is your duty, gentlemen, to have this affair investigated im- mediately; if not, the Truckmen of Boston will demolish the Nunnery on Thursday night.

I  The effect of these on the minds of the ignorant rabble was electric, and proved that the infamous work-  ers in the hideous work of that night knew well the inflammable nature of the characters of the creatures they had got to manage. The threat contained in the first of these notices, that the Truckmen of Boston would demolish the Nunnery on Thursday night, was intended to throw the authorities off their guard. One hour after the distribution of these handbills, a general cry was raised of, "Tear down the d-d rookery!" Now was the moment for Buzzard to make a sudcTen assault at one of the windows of the Convent. Ells example was' followed by Craze, and, in less time than it takes to write it, a simultaneous rush was made by a majority of the crowd, and windows and doors were smashed in with a vengeance that was pitiable to behold. Oaths, curses, and blasphemies accompanied the work of destruction; while those who were not actually en- gaged in the demolition of the holy edifice procured torches, in order, apparently, to give light to the wreck- ers, but, in reality, to be ready to consign the whole building and its beautiful surroundings to the devouring element of the flames. Simultaneously with the smashing of the doors and windows of the Convent, the mob rushed frantically in- to the building.

Hurriedly, in the dark hours of. night, distracted and bewildered, those poor, defenceless women and chil- dren were compelled to fly from their home-their sanc- tuary for life, as many of them believed-half dressed, and not knowing where to flee. Instinctively they' sought the rear of the building, but even there they had to climb over fences, and wander through paths un- known to them. Some gathered together in the sum- mer-house, their pleasant retreat in happy hours; others wandered, scarcely knowing whither, desirous only of escaping from the infuriated wretches who had turned the sweet, peaceful shades of Mount Benedict into a pandemonium. Onward they moved, noiselessly and under cover of the night, looking through the darkness before them for some kindly haunt where they might seek shelter and safety. Behold it, men of Massachusetts! . Even ye of the present day, beholdthat sight!

CECILIA AND KATE VISIT FATHER BYRNE-PATRICK CROLLY ON INACTION-A NUN ATTEMPTS TO SAVE THE HOLY TABERNACLE. "For there come a mightier blast, There shallbe a darker day; And the stars, from Heaven down-cast, Like red leaves be swept away I Kyrie eleison I Christe eleison P" CECILIA and Kate having learned something from Biddy, the apple-woman, as to the progress of events at the convent, paid a short visit, in company with Patrick Crolly, to the house of Father Byrne. The good priest was just after despatching several messen- gers to the different authorities in and around Charles- town, informing them of the imminent danger to life and property at the Convent.  Several times he made the attenmpt to pierce the crowds who encircled the building, but soon found out the utter impossibility of that course. When the sudden action of the mob to wreck the Con- vent became known, the inmates hurriedly left. The interior of the building was then speedily taken posses- sion of, so that the friends of the institution who be- lieved that nothing further than a violent demonstration of popular anger would take place, were thus taken completely unawares, believing, no doubt, that some spirit of manhood was still left among the clamorous crowd, that would forbid a personal intrusion on the undefended home of ladies and children. "  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7146-00000118"/> 210      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, But herein was the greatest of all mistakes. A wild and infuriated drunken rabble of men, with passions excited to the very utmost by inflammatory handbills and by the active but secret machinations of thieves and religious bigots, knows not where to stop, once the machinery of such a hellish system is set to work. Father Byrne, therefore, anxious to use as much pre- vention as possible, but neVer believing that matters would arrive at such-a crisis as they did, kept out of sight, -when his presence would only have added fuel to the flame. He was glad to see his friends visit him even at an unseasonable hour, for he himself required some sym- pathy as well as others. He received none from either Cecilia or Kate. Rather did they come to be consoled. From all they could learn, and observe for themselves, they dreaded the worst, and were not far mistaken. Patrick Crolly was almost dumb with horror. But that he was restrained by the combined influences of his sister and Cecilia Morton, he would undoubtedly have undertaken a task that might, that could have had but one result-the penalty of bloodshed. It was Kate's knbwledge of this that made her pro- pose a visit to the priest. Cecilia partially under- stood Kate's mind, and seconded her efforts. A few private words, hurriedly spoken by Kate to Father Byrne, made known the state of her mind and her fears regarding any action of her brother. Father Byrne at once comprehended the meaning of her visit, and used his peaceful persuasion to good effect with Patrick Crolly, by expressing his belief that matters would turn out better than' might be expected under the circumstances. "Very true, sir," replied Patrick Crolly; "Matters may not turn out as badly as they appear; but that is   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       2" just the very reason why steps should be taken at once to ensure the safety of the place. Should they turn out differently from what you now expect, or rather hope, how then?" "I1 fully appreciate your view of the case," answered the priest, earnestly addressing himself to the speaker; "but even admitting that a change for the worse should occur, there is nothing that we could do, presently, to prevent the evil." "It is not for me, Father, to dispute with you on such matters, knowing that you are the better judge of such things in these quarters, and believing, as I do, that you are fully competent to understand the whole situation. For my own part, I consider it a disgrace to stand idly by and see the danger increasing, without going forth and making an attempt in some way to con- front that crowd of cowardly blackguards whose pre- sence before the convent is a sacrilege." Father Byrne fullyrealized the meaning of these words, slowly and deliberately utttered by the brother of Kate. In fact, if he had judged himself by the heart, as Pa- trick Crolly had just done, he would necessarily have arrived at the same conclusion. Still, he hoped against hope, and again assured his visitors of his belief that the worst had arrived. At this juncture a private messenger rushed in to Father Byrne, and communicated some intelligence which seemed to please the priest very much. "Just as I expected," he said. "' the crowd is breaking up in disorder, threatening to return on Thursday next. That will afford ample time for sufficient precautions to be taken on the part- of the authorities." This was not the very latest news, but it helped to reassure the good priest that his judgment had been properly formed. Kate and Cecilia eagerly grasped at the apparent good tidings, and made a move to leave.  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7146-00000119"/> 212     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, Another messenger arrived, but a motion of the hand of Father Byrne prevented him immediately commum1i- catinug whatever news he had to impart. With a kindly good-night, and 'God bless you " theheart-broken priest bowed his visitors to the door. Patrick Crolly experienced no small difficulty bringing his sister and Cecilia to their residence. "iPatrick, you will come in and remain with us a while: we shall feel so lonely ," said Rate. Hier brother refused, more with a nod of the head than by words. Cecilia joined Kate's entreaty, although the tone of her voice had a nervousness about it which it did not, usually possess. "]Miss Morton's request at any other time would be obeyed by me as if it were a command," was Patrick Crolly's reply. Cecilia did not venture to repeat her request, but clung closer to Kate, as Patrick Crolly, with a polite bow, took his departure. Kate looked after her brother, to see which way he went. Cecilia, too, betrayed an interest to see what direction he took when leaving. A few minutes and he was concealed from their sight. He has gone towards Boston," remarked Kate. had often been their wont of late. Patrick Crolly was too much agitated to think of go- ing quietly to his hotel Accordingly, he retraced his steps, and       ere long was right in the middle of the drunken and brutal rabble around the convent. He mixed in with the crowd, in the hope of seeing some one whose appearance would indicate displeasure at the profanity which he witnessed. But in this he was dis- appointed, and a momentary sickness came over him as   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      213 he beheld the ruffianism of the crowd increase. Ribald jests and obscene expressions, the like of which he had never heard before, fell fast and thick around him. The shouts of those within the Convent, and the exe- crations of those without, made the scene a thing of unutterable horrors, "See, Bill," roared out sack Buzzard to his brother, "that Rat Keeley is digging away at them desks this quarter hout and more."$7 Just then the person r/ferred to made his exit from the apartment he had pltLndered. "Lay in like a good 'un, Craze!" shouted Harry Buck to his friend; "Pond ain't idle, I tell you." ' I guess not," was the short rejoinder of Harry Craze, who was making the most of his opportunity. The chief part of the rabble had just then gathered together in a room where an idiot, known by the name of Marvin Marcy, was engaged in the destruction of a splendid library. Tar-barrels were lighted by some of Keeley's com- panions in front of the place where Marcy was engaged in a sort of mock-auction business. The- valuable collection of books belonging to Bishop Fenwick, which contained many rare and valuable works on science, philosophy, and theology, were scattered before this uneducated boor, Marcy; and, as he proceeded, the books were knocked down to supposed bidders, and consigned to the flames of the fire without. MXantime, the affrighted Nuns were fast taking their departure. One of them, in delicate health and almost frightened to death, was being supported by two of the Sisters. She had fainted more than once, and in the- midst of the awful peril which surrounded them, those poor, dear creatures, who had never given offence to mortal being in their lives, suffered an agony of mind which only few could understand.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7146-00000120"/> 214     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, The ruffians who had been instrumental in bringing affairs to the crisis which had then occurred, were engaged ransacking every private drawer and desk where they were likely to succeed in their robberies. Silver plate, gold watches, wearing apparel, fine musi- cal instruments, cash, in gold and silver, the property of the Convent and of the young ladies, were stolen, and afterwards disposed of privately to parties in Boston. It was not strange that nearly all those most actively. engagored in this diabolical robbery, had -determined beforehand to quit that part of the country, immedi- ately after they had succeeded in their plunder. Apparently, they were of one mind in all things pertaining to their evil course, but not even one knew of the ulterior intention of the other, once the hours of that night had passed. To make the most of it was the motto of one and all. The crowds outside were getting to teel very uneasy, and something was required to. keep them in order. Just then, Rat Keeley darted outward, and, rushing forward to the blazing fire, caught a brand in his hand, shouting-"Burn the Popish den to h-1!"The wildest exclamations ever heard from the same number of throats burst forth on the midnight air, and appalled even some of those who had came there to " see justice done to an imprisoned Nun." The evil work was now about being consummated, and the activity of Jack Buzzard, Keeley, and Craze lent new fervor to the crowd. The splendid furniture of the Convent schools had been gathered in a heap, and set on fire! That was a sight which, fortunately, no friends, of the Convent were doomed to witness. Two Nuns, who were passing the chapel in their flight, rushed in to prevent the worst sacrilege of that night, ipfamous in the history of Massachusetts.   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      215 The Holy Tabernacle was locked, and, not finding the key one of those weak creatures, with something like superhuman strength, lifted it in her arms, and made her escape. This was not in the days when the catacombs of Rome afforded shelter to those who sought to worship God! Such things happened in our own days, in one of the New England States, where lived the descendants of those who had been forced to leave their own country for their conscience' sake. Even in those days when Christians were flung into the arena of the amphitheatre to wrestle with lions; women and children were mostly spared, but not so in Charlestown in the year of eighteen hundred and thirty-four, nearly two thousand years after the persecution of the early Christians. -4  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7146-00000121"/> 216      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, CHAPi JIR X X X V.

LrE convent, the chapel attached, the outer buildings, and all belonging thereto were in one mass of flames. A death-like stillness reigned over the country all around. Fire companies were there, but those who composed them were either afraid or unwilling to go to work to save even a remnant of the holy places from the devouring flames. It was an awful and impressive moment: so awful and so impressive that even those who were the authors of that shame and scandal unre- deemed, stood appalled at the sight of the incurable evil they had created. When the flames were at their highest Mrs. Alvah Morton appeared at the scene and declared that iHER EYES HAD NEVER BEHELD SUCH A GLORIOUS SIGHT!

The blind mother of the Mortons stood still, not knowing where to move. A cold shivering came over her; she staggered and reeled, calling at the same time for her husband to come and save her! Her hands were out- stretched for aid, but no one came to her relief.. One of the crowd in rushing past knocked her down, and she remained there fully an hour, until Patrick Crolly hap- pened to pass by. He immediately offered his aid to help her, but got confused when he found her to be blind. "This is a strange place to find one so disabled as you," remarked Crolly, as he endeavored to lead his charge from the place in which he found her. "Disabled! yes; I am disabled-and would undergo twenty such disabilities for the sight I beheld to-night." Patrick Crolly did not know how to interpret such lan- guage, and accordingly inquired what his companion meant? He was not long permitted to remain in ignorance.. The woman whom he had taken charge of soon informed him of the tribulation that had overtaken her. "Don't you find in this a retributive vengeance?" asked Patrick Crolly. "Vengeance for what?" "For your exclamation of delight at beholding an un- paralleled injury to others who never did you harm." "Hush I " said the blind woman, as her conductor led her quietly towards the place she had directed. "That Nunnery deserved to be burned. Those who inhabited that place made a Papist of our niece-I mean my hus- band's niece. I always thought they did, and if they did not, her companion, a young Irish schemer, called Kate Crolly-perhaps you know her-did the work which the women in the black dresses were bent on doing."  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7146-00000122"/> 218      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "I think I know Miss Crolly," slowly repeated Pat- rick.- "Then you know a-a cunning young vixen.

I shall be all right in a few hours. My sight, weak at the best, was overpowered at the glorious--" "' You are now within a few yards of your place. It is right before you, and I must leave you," said Crolly. "Many thanks, sir, for your kindness. I shall be all right soon, and should like much to-see you. Please call upon me to-morrow." "Are you sure you could then know me by sight?" inquired Mrs. Morton's assistant. The woman stood still for a moment, and appeared to reflect. She spoke not; nevertheless, Patrick Crolly be- lieved he could understand some things passing in her mind. He at once judged her to be the aunt of Cecilia, and, on that account, had acted towards her with more kindness than he could have shown under different cir- cumstances. He had brought her nigh to her own door, and, in parting with her, assured her that he was a par- ticular friend not only of Miss Crolly, but of Miss Mor- ton, also. "This is the first curse of my momentary darkness," exclaimed Mrs. Morton; " but my son, the doctor, will speedily set matters right in my regatd," saying which, she stumbled into her own dwelling. Patrick Crolly retraced his steps, but only to find the Convent grounds all but deserted and in ruins! A few   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      219 drunken men loitered around, cursing and blasphem- ing. The Sister who had endeavored to bear the Holy Tab- ernacle to a place of safety, was compelled to abandon her precious burden, and conceal it in the shrubbery, near to the little burying place allotted to deceased Nuns of the Convent. "The places of the dead are sacred," she said, as, fainting and wearied, she reverently laid her holy trust near to the tombs of the dear departed. Silently she knelt beside that spot, and offered the tribute of her prayers and tears for the safety of that which was dear- er to her than a thousand lives. But the dark-minded villain, Craze, had dogged the steps of the sainted creature who had thus risked every- thing to accomplish her holy mission. No sooner was she gone, than Craze approached, and with the Strength and violence generated by his drunken state, wrenched open THE DOOR OF THE EARTHLY COV- ER OF THE HOLY OF HOLIES! "This must be a chest of plate,' exclaimed the vil- lain, as he lifted the holy ciborium in his polluted hands. To his astonishment, he found but that and the chalice! For a moment or two, he shook with an unknown fear. In his confusion, the ciborium became overturned, and its most holy contents were spread upon the ground! He knew not this, but eagerly clasping his prize, ran off as fast as he could. Exhausted almost to death, the poor Nun, who had striven to a point beyond nature to save that which was far dearer than the Convent, had obtained shelter in the house of a neighboring gentleman. When requested to retire and take some sleep, she refused, and begged permission to sit by a window where she might behold the sad devastation of her beloved home.

"'The dogs of Pilate may have lapped the Sacred Blood of our dear Lord from off the scourges," she repeated to herself, "and indignities born of sin have often since then been flung in the face of the world's Redeemer." With such thoughts she endeavored to pass the tedious hours, not knowing how her compan- ions fared, or if they had escaped from evils worse than death itself. Behold that desolate creature Lonely she sat by the window; her eyes fixed on the one spot which of all others on earth was to her the dearest. The dying flames which encircled her late happy home caused her sight to diverge from the place where she believed she had safely deposited her heavenly trust. But she thought not of the convent. Every emotion of her pure soul was directed to the one place, and even then she desired to rush forth and satisfy herself of the safety of her plan to secure that which was more precious to her- self and her community than all else besides. The first blush of the eastern sky had scarcely tinged the yet smouldering ruins on Mount Benedict, when that pale and watchful creature, wrapped in a thin mantle, rushed forth to offer her prayers at the hidden shrine, to which her heart directed her. In her anxiety to reach the place, she flew rather than walked. rThe moment she arrived at the elevated spot, she fell upon her knees to worship God's Presence, doubting and trusting as to the safety of her previous charge. A glance or two soon revealed to her the terrible truth that the hand of sacrilege had been before her. There, before her tear-stained eyes, lay the proof! The little tabernacle had been wrenched open, and its sacred contents removed. Wildly she gazed around, but only to encounter the frightful spectacle of two men en.

Benedict, subsequently Superior to this same community, is appended. Those desirous of further information can find it in the ample details of a phamphlet published by Patrick Donahoe, of, Boston, and entitled, '"The Charlestown Convent; its Destruction by a Mob, on the Night of August 11, 1834." "On the evening of the 11th of August, 1834, we all retired to rest, but were awaked a little after nine by screams of ' Down with the Nunnery I Down with the Nunnery 1! We dressed with all haste possible, and on going to the windows of the second story, perceived some men standing in front of the Convent, and a few on horseback. The Superior (Madame St. George) spoke to them, and asked what they wanted? Their answer was that the building was to be torn down, and they wanted to come in. She told them that the Selectmen of the town had been all over the house that afternoon, and that if they would take patience, they might do the same next morn- ing, but that the night was no time for admitting visitors. They then went off to the extremity of the Convent grounds, and seemed to be holding a consultation. -After a while they lighted a bonfire, danced round it, and screamed like infernal beings. Pretty soon the alarm bells were rung, as on occa- sion of fire, and the engines approached, but were forcibly stopped at the gate of the entrance on Medford Road. What a moment that was for us! Our hearts had been exalted at the  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7146-00000124"/> 222      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, approach of the engines; we imagined our situation to be known, and, in seeing the crowd swelled to an immense num- ber, we thought that THERE must be friends, as well as toes. We waited most anxiously, expecting that aild rmust come, but we waited in vain. It was then that a sense of the full extent of our forlorn situation rushed upon us like a tide, and it must have overwhelmed us, had not -Duty obliged us, for the sake of our sick Sisters, and of the children, to force upon us a certain composure and presence of mind. "The mob then increased most fearfully, and again came up to the front of the Convent, screaming as before: ' Down with the Nunnery I Down with the Nunnery!' A Lay Sister (S. Bernard, who died in Quebec, March 25,1838) appeared at one of the windows, beseeching them to leave off acting in that way, as the children were almost frightened to death. Are there any men in the house?' they inquired. "'Not one,' said the Lay Sister; 'we are all unprotected women and children; for God's sake leave us quiet.' "'That is a nice lady,' said they, 'and she deserves better to be Superior than you,' looking up to Madame St. George, standing in the window of the second story. They then in- sulted her, wagged their heads, sang obscene songs, called her the Figure Head, shouted and yelled like demons, and a gun was fired at her from under the willow tree in the labyrinth, Just in front of the house. The tumult was now at its height, and we. from the windows of the Convent, seemed to be look- ing into the infernal regions. "After a while the mob retreated, shouting as they went, 'Good night till Thursday.' This was Monday night. We then thought all was over, and directions were. given to the children to go to bed again, when suddenly the windows were heard to crash and the doors to give way, under the assault of those without. We immediately left the house by the back doors, taking shelter in the summer house at the extremity of the garden. This. I think, was at 11 o'clock. Meanwhile, Sisters Mary Joseph and Bernard flew to the chapel to save the Blessed Sacrament; and, not being able to find the key, while the latter bore off the tabernacle-so heavy that a mau must have found difficulty in lifting it-the former went up stairs again to see if Sister Mary Austin, who, in con- sequence of fright, had fallen into a fit in the course of the evening, had yet made her escape. She found her partly un- dressed. and so completely stupefied, that she could with diffi- culty get on her clothes and drag her off. Two of the large   THE VIOLATED TOMB.        223 girls were with them, and all escaped without being molested, though they met several men in passing out. The children all went to a neighbors house, but we remained in the cloister till the men, after having searched the Convent, rushed into that we should seek safety in flight. We hastily passed the limits which, a few hours before, we should have deemed it sacrilege to violate. The cloister was soon left far behind, and we, who had thought to live and die in peace on that hallowed spot, found ourselves, in the dead of the night, wandering through the fields, expecting, every moment, to be seized by some lawless ruffian, and we were at length obliged to seek an asylum in a secular house, and from a stranger I - "Having arrived at Mr. Adams', on Winter Hill, we sent for the children, who had stopped at Mr. Cutter's, for we felt anxious to have them under our own eye. Some slept on the carpets, and some on our knees, while others conversed. Two of the youngest came triumphantly to show their dolls, which they had saved. In the wreck of that night, they had lost clothes, books, jewelry, and many valuable articles, but they were smiling with angelic innocence, and harbored not a feel- ing of regret, having saved what, in their eyes, was most pre- cious of all. "At this time, Sister St. Henry, a novice, was extended on a sofa; her limbs were deathly cold, her face of a marble white- ness, and her lips of a livid hue, as though the spirit had' for- saken its earthly tenement. This lady had been for some time, in a delicate state of health, and the scenes of the few preceding hours had had a fearful effect upon her frame. On leaving the Convent, two Nuns were obliged to support her, for she had scarcely sufficient strength to take a step alone, and when arrived at Mr. Adams', we thought she might not live till morning. "At about one o'clock it was announced to us, that the con. vent was in flames, and we went up stairs to look at it. It was a splendid, though a melancholy sight; but, to complete the scene, we must add the awful screams of the mob, which, now and then, interrupted the stillness of the midnight hour; the peals of satanic laughter that at times struck on our ears, and the infernal shouts that rent the air at the moment that the Cross fell in. Our feelings at that time may not be imagined, much less be described; still, God had permitted all for the best, though His designs were enveloped in mystery. Good might be drawn from evil, and, though afflicted, we were re- signed.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7146-00000125"/> 224      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, "At two o'elock the parents and friends of the children, who by that time had got information of what was going on, camo to inquire after and take them home. Bishop Fenwick sent his ecclesiastics, with carriages, for us at six o'clock, and we were conducted to the Sisters of Charity, There we found the good Bishop deeply afflicted, and the Sisters in tears. Every kindness was lavished upon us. Sister Mary John, who had been in a delirium all night, Sister St. Henry and Sister Mary Austin, were put to bed, and were made to take some refresh- ment. "Sister Bernard had got separated from us in thenight. She carried the tabernacle till she felt herself completely exhausted from its weight, and then concluded, though relue antly, to hide it in some bushes, not having the slightest suspicion that the rioters would extend their searches to that secluded spot. She then went to a neighboring house, proposing to return in the morning for the tabernacle. At the dawn of day she en- veloped herself in a cloak and went to the spot, but found nothing. She then went to the tomb, which was open, and saw some men inside, breaking the coffins, and the tabernacle on the ground, with the door forced open, and empty. The wretch who had stolen the Blessed Sacrament cut his throat that very day or the day following. "We continued with the Sisters of Charity two months, and then took a house in Roxbury. Sister. St. Henry died a week after our removal, forgiving and praying for her murderers. Two days after, some of the Sisters left for the Ursuline con. vent of Quebec, the members of which had offered us repeated invitations to that effect; and in the month of May, 1835, the rest followed. We returned to Boston in 1838. "SR. M. BENEDIOT, Superior."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       225 CHAPTER X xx VI. AN EARLY MASS-REFLECTIONS BY PATRICK CROLLY- BIDDY IN A NEW SPHERE. ", Hail, then, hail to you all! To the heirdom of heaven be ye welcome I Children no more from this day, But, by covenant, brothers and sisters." Y3 something like a miraculous direction, Father Byrne, who was early astir around the desecrated grounds of the Convent, came to the very spot where the sacred contents of the ciborium had fallen from the hands of Craze. In an instant he was on his knees in adoration, and gave thanks to God that the profanation which he had expected had not been consummated. His were the hands that had, placed the ciborium in the tab- ernacle, and from that which he then witnessed, he felt satisfied that the sacrilege had ceased with the theft of the sacred vessel. Meeting with the Sister who had been there on the same errand, he informed her of this circumstance, and a light of heavenly beauty overspread her face as she listened to the glad tidings. She then informed him of the sudden decision of the mob to bum the Convent, and of the speed made in the work of devastation. In a voice broken with sobs, she further informed him of her attempt to save the taber- nacle and its contents, and Father Byrne could not avoid shedding tears of pity and admiration as he lis- tened to her rehearsal. His words of assurance con- cerning the Blessed Sacrament gave the poor afflicted Nun the greatest comfort and consolation, and many a -X  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7146-00000126"/> 226     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, prayer of thanks she offered to God, as she took her way to search for her companions and impart to them the news she had just learned from the pious priest. On Father Byrne's return to his own dwelling, he found Patrick Crolly before him, who communicated the news of his accidental meeting with Cecilia's aunt. The Priest was much struck with the information afforded him concerning Mrs. Morton. "You have served Mass in your boyhood days, I pre- sume, Mr. Crolly," said Father Byrne, addressing his visitor. "Many times, sir, almost daily, for a number of years." "I am glad to hear you say so. I desire to celebrate Mass, to-day as early as possible, and you will assist." Patrick Crolly assented, and was even glad at the opportunity of doing as required. While engaged wait- ing on the priest, his thoughts reverted to those days when, in Ireland, his dear mother's greeting awaited him onhis return from the parish chapel, after having as- sisted in the mannoer now proposed to him by Father Byrne. Then he was happy, and blessed in the possession of both parents. The song of the morning lark was not more joyful than the merry laugh of Patrick Crolly, as he and his younger brother, Owen, alternately carried sister Kate over the rough bye-roads to the daisied mea- dow, where, in the bright days of summer, they ram- bled and played together with the fresh, hearty glee of youth. Those days were bright indeed-too bright to last, thought Patrick Crolly. The shadows came after- ward, bringing with them cares and anxieties, which,- after all, had but purified the lives of those over whose heads they fell. True, Owen and his dear little wife, Mary, were happy at home-atleast, so thought Patrick Crolly, in his pardonable musings; and, after a severe   THE VIOLATED TOMB.       227 term of probation, he had almost, as if by a miracle, discovered his beloved sister Kate. He felt almost as happy as ever. His mind had suffered much in conse- quence of the sad scenes which he had lately witnessed, and he rightly interpreted that the early Mass that morning, by Father Byrne, was in some way connected with the horrors of the night which had just passed I It was by the merest accident-such, especially, as often takes place with strangers in a new country-that Patrick Crolly got separated from his sister Kate one Sunday evening while leaving church after vespers. This happened in Boston, on the evening of their arrival there, and before they had sufficient time to take up their residence in that town. Patrick Crolly had travelled over a good deal of the country in search of his sister, following every one's ad- vice rather than the dictates of his own mind. Kate acted differently. She remained in Boston without en- gaging in any extraordinary exertion to discover her brother, as he had done in her regard. Her -mind at once directed her to the belief that under such circum- stances Patrick would eventually continue his search for her in and around the district wheie they had first been separated. Meantime Kate could not afford to be idle. and, as has already been seen, soon found employment in the house of Alvah Morton, where her kindly good nature so endeared her to Cecilia, that a lasting friend- ship had sprung up between the two girls which no un- toward circumstance could violate. "'Twas indeed most strange," repeated Patrick Crolly to himself, in those moments of self-communion, "to think that Kate and I were thus so accidentally sepa- rated; and then to look at the results of that separation, and the strange circumstances which have led to our discovery of each other." Yes; there was plenty of food for thought in all these          .  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7146-00000127"/> 228      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, things, and the study of them kept Patrick Crolly fully occupied until called by Father IByrne. Entering a small oratory, Patrick Crolly was not a little astonished to find there before him some eight per- sons, permitted by Father Byrne to be present. Among these he observed Kate and Cecilia, Biddy the apple- woman, two nuns, and three young men, one of whom he had seen a few days previous in company with the priest. There was no sign of recognition on the part of any present. Mass being finished, Father Byrne entered into con- versation with his little flock. He described to them how one of the Sisters present had endeavored during the terrors of the night to bring the tabernacle of the Convent chapel to a place of safety; but, lest feelings of sorrow should predominate too much in the minds of his hearers, he changed the conversation and paid some compliments to Biddy, who had been present during the worst scenes of the outrage, and endeavored to do all in her power to assist the nuns in their flight. "It was the poor children, your Reverence. And sure I carried two of them in my arms, and then came back to give some help to the poor, fainting Sister; but it's little help she'll require after a while. She's murdered! and may God-" "Take care, Biddy!" suddenly remarked the clergy- man. "Forgive them, sir, I was only going to say," added Biddy, with a sorrowful sigh. "That's right, Biddy. There is nothing like praying for those who do us an injpry." "Isn't there, indeed?" said Biddy, with something very like, or approaching to a sneer. 'Well, if the villains of last night, your Reverence, never get a day's good luck till I pray for them, their time will hang very heavy on their hands-that's all I say."   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      229 Solemn as the occasion was, Father Byrne and his few auditors could not refrain from smiling at this plain declaration of unforgiveness on the part of Biddy. Soon after, a messenger arrived with the news that the Nuns and pupils of the Convent were all safe, hav- ing received the hospitalities of gentlemen's houses in the neighborhood. Father Byrne hastened his preparations to confer with the Bishop, and therefore bid his friends good-by. By the special request of Cecilia Morton, Biddy ac- companied that young lady and Kate Crolly. Biddy looked on this invitation as a special favor, and, once arrived at the place of their destination, very soon exhibited her tidy ways in small matters relating to housekeeping. "I should suppose, Biddy," said Cecilia, with a pleased manner, " that you were not always confined to your trade of apple-selling." "Not always, Miss Morton. I tried and tried, to get a situation hereabouts, but failed; and then I just said to myself, 'You can't succeed, Biddy, and there's no dis- grace in following up any daicent employment, and so I just threw away my bit of pride, and took the advice of a friend, and commenced a little trade." "But you seem to be adapted for something better," added Cecilia.' "I am just now in want of a person of clean, tidy habits, like yourself--that is, Miss Crolly and I are in want,-and I think you could not do better than to make up your mind to come and help us." "That just settles the matter!" replied Biddy, in a somewhat mysterious manner. Cecilia did not understand, neither did Kate, and for a few moments there was a slight confusion. Biddy observed this, and endeavored to explain. "You see, Miss Morton, and Miss, Kate-begging your pardons-you see how it is, just this: Ould Ryan  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7146-00000128"/> 230.     MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, and myself were talking, lately, about the markets, and he says to me, ' Biddy (here the speaker held down her head), times is dull, but after a while '-them's jist his very words-' you and I ought to strike up a closer acquaintance; we're both in onetrade,and why shouldn't both be one in something else?' Well, you see, I thought over the matter, and waited, but ne'er a word did Ryan spake On the subject since. So, I'm your obadient sarvant, Miss Morton," and Biddy made a curtsey as she finished her unvarnished story. Cecilia tried to preserve a quiet and sober aspect, but * failed. She could not keep back the tribute of a laugh at Biddy's outspoken manner. Kate Crolly, too, although her heart was far from mirth, joined with Cecilia, and then Biddy herself laughed with the young ladies. The latter, however, wasJust then thinking of the effect oi a "1 disappointment in love', 'n the part of old Ryan, whose life was altogether mixed up with the markets. It was arranged, there and then, that Biddy should enter on her new situation as soon as possible, and, with a view to that purpose, she took her leave, promising to return as soon as possible; and, as an earnest of her outspoken nature, declared, as she left, that she would just as soon " work for three as for two, and she did not care if the third should assume the shape of a man in the house." i"That was intended for you, Cecilia," said Kate, as, soon as Biddy had retired. Cecilia did not reply, but appeared busily engaged with some very unnecessary work. As fast as she made things right, she put them wrong again, and, finding out her mistakes, hurriedly left the room somewhat unceremoniously. Kate had been paying but little attention to anything around her, while, on the other hand, Cecilia thought that her companion's eyes were fastened on her, and   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      231 had detected her slight mistakes, caused by the late remarks of the outspoken Biddy.

AFTER EVENTS-SUICIDE OF CRAZE. "I know not whether God will have it so, For some displeasing service 1 have done, That, in his secret doom, out of my blood He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me?. As soon as the sorrowful news relating to the Con- vent had reached the good Bishop Fenwick, his sorrow became almost overwhelming. He hastened to secure a refuge for the homeless Nuns, and those of their charge whose guardians were far removed. In the meantime, the parents of the children who had attended the Convent, and who resided in Charlestown, Boston, and vicinity, hearing of the terrible disasters that had overtaken the establishment, sought out the hiding places of their little innocents, and speedily removed them to their homes. It is worthy of remark, that nearly all those parents were Protestants, or dissenters of some sort, and, during that period of excitement, Bishop Fenwick received no more hearty expressions of sorrow, of sympathy, and condolence, than such as came from those parents. This, above all things else, proved the high estima- tion in which the Convent was held, and it must have been a source of sincere gratification to the supreme Pastor of the district, to receive such kindly evidence of good will from those who differed in religious opinion from himself; and those dear creatures, who1 under his fostering care, had made the schools of   THE YIOLATED TOMB.      233 Mount Benedict a theme of praise on the part of all who were best fitted to judge. Thus, in tearing down one monument, the bigots and conspirators raised another. In the midst of the excitement, consequent on these terrible scenes, the report went abroad, and was shortly after confirmed, that Harry Craze, who had sacrileg- iously opened the Holy Tabernacle, had cut his throat on the day following His body was found in an out-house near to the residence of Rat Keeley. This terrible judgment struck many with awe, and none more so than Mrs. Alvah Morton, who fainted when she heard the news. Meetings were held in Boston, Charlestown, and other places, to condemn the outrage which had been committed. The most respectable citizens took part in these meetings, and the sentiments delivered by them spoke well for the tolerant principles of the speakers. Further than this they did not go. Some few had proposed an indemnity to the Catholics for what they had lost, but either through supineness, or a dread of unpopularity, the movement went no farther. The money value of the loss sustained amounted to nearly one hundred thousand dollars; but the debt of honor still remains unpaid. There, in view of Bunker Hill, the grandest monument to human freedom in the world, stand to this day the ruins of the Convent of Mount Benedict! Massachusetts requires a long and painful evidence of its own iniquity ere that part of the great American Commonwealth can fully realize its indebtedness to the principles of the American Constitution. Time tries all, and even the Puritan State may, in time to come, redeem itself from the foul stain incurred by its apathy during the August of Eighteen Hundred and Thirty-four!  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7146-00000130"/> 234      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR,  After the destruction of the Convent, Keeley, Buz- zard, and other participants were tried for arson, &amp;c Harry Buck, true to his evil nature, turned State's evi- dence against his former companions. Religious, or rather party excitement, ran high at the time. At one place it was announced that twenty thousand Irishmen were ready, at an hour's call, to enter Boston and Charlestown and avenge the dark deeds committed at Mount Benedict! Bishop Fenwick. however, exerted himself to the utmost to prevent retaliation. He con- vened meetings, and implored of his hearers to forgive the crimes of those who had injured them. Independently of all the testimony brought against the chief instigators, they were liberated! Some of the minor tools in the sad catastrophe were imprisoned, but the humane action of Bishop Fenwick and the leading Catholics procured their release. It was pretty evident at the time that in consequence of the threats held out to the jurors on the trials that no other result than a defeat of justice could have taken- place. Assassination was put forth as the reward of any juror who dared to find a prisoner guilty, and inas- much as the Rev. Alvah Morton, Jr., and others of his class, saw fit to use their profession for the justification of those who were proved to have been guilty of act and part in the destruction of the Convent, it is not to be wondered at that justice should have miscarried. The scenes during the trial, where the Mother Super- ior and those of of her spiritual children appeared, shall never be effaced from the memory of men. Those were sad days, and their obliteration depends in great measure on the future conduct of the people of Boston and vicinity. Already we observe indications of a better spirit appearing in the chief State of New England, and even that is something to feel thankful for.

KATE Crolly's intention of entering Mount Benedict Convent as a novitiate, was frustrated by the murder- Convent as a               Thst'iat of l"t - . y , ous occurrences on the 11thl of August, 1834. These, however, did not prevent Kate from following up the vocation she felt herself called to. A number of the Ursuline Sisters had retired to Canada, and Kate fol- lowed them. After her term of probation had passed, this dear, sweet girl assumed the Black Veil of the Order she had loved so much. The same day that witnessed the consummation of Kate's most earnest desire to enter the service of the Ursulines, also witnessed the marriage nuptials of Ce- c'ilia Marton and patrick Crolly I "And sure I often tould you, Mrs. Crolly, that you would never finish your eddication in the Convent," assured, that, so far as it remained in the power of Kate Crollyto correspond with her sister-in-law, there was not wanting the fullest inculcation of old lessons, taught on manty a bright and happy day before-layea   THE VIOLATED TOMB.      237 and on many 'a dark and bitter day besides. Uncle Morton was among the first visitors to Cecilia after her marriage. He was glad to see her, and expressed the pride he felt in beholding her husband. Cecilia was much pleased with the remarks of, her uncle, and told him many things she had learned con- cerning his early life. 4 But God has spoken before you, Madam, and taught Mr. Morton many things," said Biddy, who had gained upon her small privileges, and took advantage of her position to express her mind much better than if she "had been stuck to that ould apple-man,. Ryan, who didn't know much of anything." Cecilia was anything but displeased to hear the re- marks of Biddy. Her husband, also, was present, and indicated by his looks that he considered Biddy's re- marks as well-timed. Cecilia, with her unwonted good- ness of heart, identified herself with her husband, and so made the visit of Uncle Morton much easier than he had expected. During a quiet conversation with Ce- cilia and her husband, he communicated to them the fact that he had once been a Catholic, but had, until lately, forgotten God and his religion. The departure I of Cecilia and Kate from his roof, had opened his mind to a reconsideration of his early days, and the late burn- ing of the Convent of Mount Benedict, and the terrible affliction which had befallen his wife, had finished the good work of his conversion. "Didn't I tell yees that God had spoken before yees," exclaimed Biddy, with tears in her eyes, as she retired to offer thanks to God "' for--for-everything." Mr. Morton left soon after. For nearly two years he labored hard to undo the errors of an earlier life, and partially succeeded. Mrs. Morton lived some years after him. The Rev. Alvah Morton, the Doctor, and David Dodge, were in no ways changed, save that in  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7146-00000132"/> 238      MOUNT BENEDICT; OR, their attention to their blind mother they acted the part of anything but dutiful sons.

"Biddy, Biddy," said Father Byrne, " just think ot what you are about." ' I'm thinkin', yourReverence-but I'fl never be able to think over all this trouble." "Why, you old fool, the child is a girl, and Kate is the name?" said Father Byrne. "Och, then, your Reverence-poor Biddy has no choice; but, sure, I was misinformed." Biddy never felt too proud of her position after that day. Meeting old Ryan, the pippin man, soon after, she was reminded of her mistake concerning the first- born of Cecilia's family. - "Never mind, old melon-monger," said Biddy, "I ain't so old but I'll live to see a Patrick born in the sane family." And Biddy was as good as her word. The after career of the chief instigators at-the burn- ing of the Convent of Mount Benedict was sinful and sorrowful: it needs not to be recounted here. The Mother Superior died as she had lived-a child of God, the predestined of Heaven. Her children were scattered for a while, but eventually they returned to the land that had driven them forth from the holy sanc- tuary of their home. Even at the present day, some of them live to continue the good work of training Amer'.- can youth to the service of God and the practice of those homely virtues which, when possessed, render womankind the envy of the world. The ruins of the Convent of Mount Benedict, and its   THEM VIOL&amp;XTED TOMB.      39 Violated Tombs, remain as. they were left by the hands of the desecrators, save in so far as they are covered with the mouldering ivy that would conceal the law- lessness of nearly forty years ago.
