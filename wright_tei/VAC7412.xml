Mr. Lambert resided on a fashionable street in the Queen City, supporting a style somewhat aristocratic in his own opinion, and truly enviable in the eyes of surrounding citizens. His mansion, internally, and externally, was provi- ded wlth every comfort and convenience that his taste and desire could suggest; also many ornaments, dis- playing the taste of his wife and daughter, could be seen by casting a glance through the curious wrought fence, that encircled their grounds from the plebeian tread. Upon either side of the little shell walks were nurtured and trained the greatest profusion of flowers and shrubs, which wafted their fragrance as free to the passer-by as to their two mistresses, who every spring would oversee and assist the progress of their little Eden. The interior of Mr. Lambert'S dwelling was furnished a la mode with the latst impor- tations.' (7)  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7412-00000005"/> 8       MY THREE NEIGHBORS The association and appearance of a thus elegantly furnished mansion, not only sustained the Hon. Mr. L. and lady in dignitate superiori, but created a haughty spirit in their handsome young daughter, Miss Julia, who had never known else than this style of living. Julia was one of those pretty black-eyed girls whose every step was proud and queenly, yet her eye was full of mischief, and just enough bewitching to capti- vate the modest. schoolboy at a glance, as he passed upon the street. Julia was passing the sunny hours of youth in the best seminary of the city; yet the beauties of botany and astronomy could not gain her attention like the latest pattern for a miss's dress, or a new piece of music. Frequently when Julia was bending over her stu- dies, she would find herself in imagination riding along some pretty road; perhaps an accident, and' a rescue by some handsome fellows, a general romance passing through her mind, when instantly she would get a glimpse of her lesson, and reprimand herself for wafting time in building, air-castles, take a glance at her book, and in a few mohents be conjuring up a new style basque. So it were not strange if Julia's education was superficial. Nor was it her fault, for she was the only child of wealtfy parents; -and although young, her second aeptenium had been variegated with embroidery, piano-forte, shell-work, and cotillion accomplishments, of which she fondly   IN THE QUEEN OITY.       ; 9 loved the latter; and now being so much loved and admired, she thought education was a minor affair. Julia was only past fifteen years, yet she was already receiving instructions from her ma, as to the manner of conducting herself, should she be, called upon by some of the city gents. Mr. Lambert's, neighbor, upon  one side, was ,Joshua Lane, Esq., a very plain man, who believed in the comforts of life, but not in the superfluities. He owned the neat and comfortable duelling in which he resided; had formerly been a planter in Alabama, afterward a merchant; was now living comfortably and genteelly on a moderate yearly income. IIis daughter Lizzie was of a lighter complexion than Julia Lambert: having dark auburn hair, and a full blue eye. "Blue eyes a steady flame portray, That lives and burns beyond a day- Black eyes bespeak a lively heart, Whose kind emotions soon departi Lizzie Lane was neither homely nor beautiful; but what she lacked in beauty was supplied by talent. She was as deep-ainded and thoroughly educated as any miss in the city, of seventeen; familiar with all modern branches; at home in the classics; besides well informed in all the topics of the age. And Young America, when enjoying her good society, was careful not to branch out too largely until some ,..  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7412-00000006"/> MY THRyIk NSIGHBORS familiar subject presented itself, lest Miss Lizzie might excel even in political news. Yet Lizzie was far from being one of these self-con- ceited critics, who would sneer and beg leave to cor- reet her erring fellow-beings whenever an opportunity offered; but, per qontra, she was a lady, and would rather hide a blunder of an acquaintance, than to in- jure feelings by repeating it.  Yourfirther acquaintance will be pleasant, and no doubt you will become much attached to LTzzie hereafter. Adjoining Mr. Lambert's residence, upon the oppo. site side from Mr. Lane, resided A. J. Winfield, a commission-merchant; who, with his wife and son Charles, also three daughters, constituted the respec- table Winfield family. Kate was the eldest. of the daughters. Not brilliant at first appearance, yet there was a womanly sedateness in her manners peculiar to a lady of twenty-five, though she was not more than seventeen, possessing a mind well balanced and finely cultivated. As to her brother Charles, it would be unkind to say that he was a vain, selfish young man of twenty; yet we will venture to say that he had sufficient self-esteent and importance to pass well in society, where externals were at par. Charles was a model form, medium height, and of dark complexion; seemed most attractive at a ball or cotillion; quite popular among young ladies, but much disliked among young gentlemen of the Queen City; the latter of which might have been caused by the envy of the young fellows; or that he did not seek   IN THE QUPINK CITY.   male associates-being very fond of female society, Charles spent his time entirely to his own amusement, excepting an hour or two each day, in assisting his father, as he was a good accountant, and an excellent penman. When not thus engaged, he might be found at home upon a lounge, skimming over the last novel, collecting pretty sentences and large words, rather than lessons of. human nature, that may be culled from the popular works of the day. *   *.  *     V -  *    *   V The first day of May is at hand with all its attrac- tions. The streets are lined with various processions of happy children, preparing an attack upon the wild- flowers of the nearest wood about the city. Omni- buses loaded down with May parties, are thundering along the bowldered streets, alive and anxious for the rural scenes, and rustic romp. The little steamer, engaged by other parties, is plying its way up the Ohio; its noisy pipe beating time for the favorite band of music, teaching the hills along the Ohio to echo with some sweet extracts from De Beriot or Rossini. The boat groans beneath the merry host of social dancers, anxious for the green soil upon which to while away the day. Now and then a new impulse was added to the already anxious crew, by the horn- pipe discoursed on the upper deck. On with May, day! it is now nearly past, as you see, by the tired and weary youth. The little boys with strings offish, and many a lass with flowers and shells, 1 wlong home to rest. But troubled sleep falls or their weary ,    '  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7412-00000007"/> MY THRE MEIGH13OB limbs that night, for oft awakened in their dreams by- sudden screams, as was heard that day. It was a happy May-day that Miss Julia Lambert spent in the country, on a visit to her cousin, Miss Ella Blair. The scenes of rustic life were new to her; and it was not strange that she remained a week. She had romped over the entire farm of her uncle. Now watching the playful lambs sporting on the turf; now in the fields where the boys were dropping corn, to see the blackbird and redhead tracing the furrow, to find the hidden treasures; then down to the barn to get a ride of Fan or Dol, as they went round and round upon the threshing-floor. Perhaps another hour Fould find her in the dairy, taking a sup of new butter- milk. A day thus spent, would find Julia and Ella preparing for an evening call: as Julia had caught a beau already, who had called every evening, ad he was naturally smitten with such a lively piece, and was making every evening count one, as she was not going to stay long. A week thus spent terminates in Julia's returning home, impressed with the delights of a country visit. Julia and ma were now seated in a little arbor in the side-yard, over which the catawha, cypress, and honeysuckle, were spreading their leaves, to hide them from the afternoon's sun. "Oome, Julia, tell ma all about your visit to the country," said Mrs. Lambert "Ma, I hardly know where to commence, as every-   thing was novel, and seemed (to delight me; but the best thing was, that I had a country beau-he was so much taken with me that he called every evening." "But, daughter, how do you know that he fell in love with you, or even visited you; perhaps he was Ella's beau, and you should not have staid in the room," said Mrs. Lambert. "O no, ma; Ella hid one, too-they both came to- gether; and George Lenore, for that was his name, always talked to me, while the other gentleman talked to Ella. Just before night, Ella would tell me I must smooth my hair and look as pleasant as possible, as my beau was coming, and that he was a wealthy young farmer, and that I would do well to catch him some day for a husband." "Yes, I'll see you marry some country fellow!" said Mrs. L., ironically. "How late did they stay each evening?" "I think it was about twelve o'clock when they left for home."  Why, my daughter, I am astonished to think you would be guilty of such an impropriety, just because you were not under my supervision. You should have sent them away at half past eight o'clock; besides it is repugnant to tfy feelings to think you would mix with any person from the country in 'such familiarity, unless when our relatives come to see us, and then we cannot help it. "But, ma, he is wealthy and fine-looking, and seemed to have such good sense for a country fellow."   &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7412-00000008"/> "      MY THBE NEIGHBORS "I don't see what you found to talk about so much, each evening." "Well, I talked about city affairs, and he enter- tained me with habits and customs of the country. And when I go out again, he is to learn me how to ride on horseback ('Yes, I will see you go out again'), and then he would ride out with me every evening. And, ma, I must tell you about one little thing that I thought was so strange: the last evening that I was there, he asked me my age, and when I told him that was my birthday, he seemed amused, and said, when a girl told a beau her birthday, then he was entitled to a kiss. 1 resisted, but he succeeded in his attempt." "O, dear me, Julial go and bring me that little bottle of hartshorn and my fan." Julia walks to the drawing-room, soliloquizing how strange her mother acts about her country visit, when she enjoyed herself so much. She then returns, hands them to her ma, who is actually fretted at her daugh- ter's rudeness in the country; after a little relief from her fan, gives Julia a bit of advice, as to her future conduct, places some new notions in her head, con- cerning her situation in society, and some high-toned notions of aristocracy; intimating that she wishes her to be the attraction and belle of the Queen City. And if it was ever known that she associated with such a country fellow, it would be a serious impediment to her success in city society.    IN THE QUEliN CITY.     15 ,         CHAPTER II. DINNER IN THE COUNTRY-THE WOODLAND-AN APPLE-CUTTING. THE hot summer days are now upon us; May par. ties and spring pie-nics have passed for this year; the city seems somewhat deserted in the way of amuse- ments; the theater has dropped its curtain for a season; the minstrels have hung their "harps upon the willow;" the entire fields of pleasure have now become a desert. The wealth and fashion of the city, the young and old, are off to the north, enjoying the cool breezes of the lake, of the gay ircles of Niagara. What a source of delight is the first northern or eastern tour to a western student, who has just finished his collegiate ,course, and previous to a launch in some lifetime occupation, to have an op- portunity of, visiting the various watering-places of which our land can Ioast! Reader, do you remember the first, and perhaps the only time, that you seated yourself in 'the thundering car, bound for the north, flying past the village or town, as if beneath your notice; new scenery intro- ducing itself on every sidei for a few hours, and you have reached Lake Erie I I it not vivid in your mem- ory, how unwilling you set foot upon the large bite 2 &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7412-00000009"/> 16   --   MY THREE NEIGHBORS whiqh seemed anxious to tear you away from the soilI About midnight leave your sleepless berth, sally forth upon the deck, and find no land in sightl and did you not wonder for a moment, if it were not the Atlantic instead of Erie Did you not fear an explosion, or collision, while so far from land I Did you look around for a loose plank, or tie on a life- preserver, to be ready in case of accident?

Now you reach the land, and in a moment are surrounded, and almost torn in pieces by a hundred hungry coach- drivers. One takes you by the coat collar, another your carpet-bag; and almost before you are satisfied that yon are again on terra firma, are pushed by one, jostled by another, until you are glad to escape into the first vehicle at hand, even to be bled double the amount the law allowed for legal fare-you finally reach a- hotel, minus fifty cents or so, all for pleasure. "Good-morning, Miss Lizzie," said George Lenore, a'r he was shown into the parlor where Lizzie was sitting, one fine morning in September; "are you ready to take that ride out' to Ella Blair's, as I pro- posed when last I saw you?" "O yes, George, I am ready-I have not forgotten it. Do we take the cars"  "O no! my rockaway is at the door. I thought it would be more pleasant, as we could en'joy the scenery much better."   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      17 Lizzie and Ella were intimate friends, and old acquaintances, yet Julia Lambert did not know it, for she seldom saw her cousin Ella; and although she and Lizzie were very intimate, yet she had not mentioned it to Julia. George and Lizzie had a pleasant ride to ;-the country,.for -it was only a few miles, and they reached Blair's in time for dinner. On the way ovt, George related his new acquaintance with Julia Lanm- bert; while Lizzie was quite amused, and as much. astonished, knowing the disgust the family had for country beaux. After the Usual salutations and a hearty welcome. to Lizzie and George, the Usual summons (from the cook), informed them that dinner was ready; and such a repast. as now invited their attention, would tickle the palate of an aged epicurean-a dinner good enough for a king, and sufficient for a dozen congress- men. Instead of napkins and -rings, they had roast. turkey and domestic bread; instead of fingerglasses and river water, they enjoyed cold milk and hot coffee. Each one was helped to a full variety, and the dinner was dispatched with but little ceremony; at least the performance was not tedious enough to discourage the appetite, as might be the case in a city, where food is expensive.  It was the middle of the afternoon, when George, Ella, and Lizzie wept out upon the farm,. determine d for a regular romp; they finally, come to woodland, where they have a fine time swinging upon the grape-  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7412-00000010"/> 18      MY TurPrE NEIGHBORS vines that hang from the tops of the beech, rough sport-but such is country pleasure. And could the city miss spend the hot days of summer in the country, there would not be the pallid, sunken- cheeked females of twenty-five, that walk our streets by hundreds. But, no, they had beer- stay at home, father cannot afford to have his Ohildren traveling about, or to pay their board in the country: he is1 trying to get rich, and we think wealth is better than health, at least we want that first, and then we cant enjoy it afterward; and yet when you find the pe on who says, we have enough, let us enjoy it, then you have found a rare curiosity. The American people, en masse, toil day and night,; grasping after the mighty dollar. No holidays,- no recreation, but keep several Sundays, and one thanks- giving during the year. Give me a German life in; preference to the life'of a care-worn, money-seeking, and heaven-forgotten Yankee. Did you say the Germans were beer-drinking, stupid people I Then visit Souders-Hausen, or Baden-Baden, and see their fine workmanship, from the minutei time-piece, to the mighty tower. Visit Dusseldorf, and enjoy the fine arts; a school for all the World. - The German closes his business at three in the afternoon, and retires to the beer-garden for the balance of the day, to eat and drink under the sound of the cornet or string band--besides the hundred holidays during the year. Do you raise the accusation of my favoring a    foreign nation! Not at all, I only recommend their holidays and pastimes. As for our land, it is the ne plus ultra, having no master but God; fearing no other nation; and respected in all the earth. "Halloo! halloo! supper has been waiting a halt' hour," said Patrick to George and the ladies, as he just found them roaming through the woodland, "Faith, and it was meself that thought you were lost, and I have been nearly an hour coming up here, and it was down hill all the way, to be sure." After tea, our young folks prepare themselves for an apple-cutting, at Mr. Jones', about two miles distant. Lizzie was very anxious to attend, as she had never witnessed such a party,. Patrick was now ready with coach and two-as this style was supported by the Blairs-and perhaps the only coach that would be at the party that evening. Mr. Jones' residence was a large double frame cottage, with kitchen large enough for a country prayer-meeting, and a fireplace large enough for a full-length stick of cordwood. The kitchen wall was ornamented with tinware, and a few strings of red peppers. The parlor was furnished with a domestic carpet, some windsor chairs, a high-posted beadstead, completely covered up with white fringe, and curtain calico. In one corner stood one of those old pioneer eight-day clocks, full seven feet high; while upon the wall was a small print of General Washington, and a neatly-fraled picture of the old steamboat Alleghany. But now they were gathering in for a frolic. The  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7412-00000011"/> 2Q      MYT THRi .NEIGHBORB bright-eyed literati and alumni of the country garound were there. Several tubs and barrels of apples were'  already in the middle of the floor, surrounded by a group of rustics, all paired off, and each lgent pareing apples for his duloinea; ;who sat with knife in hand, to. quarter and core them. No one, could have been more amused than Lizzie, to see so many hands in motion-a continual shower of quartered apples find- ing; their way into a large box, convenient for all.

The scene changes, by all parties assisting in a clearing out of the boxes and pealings, preparatory to a dance:  "No sleep till morn, where youth and pleasure meet." They danced a few rounds, as they termed it, when recess for refreshments was. announced. , They now marched into the parlor, while the old lady and one of the boys passed round the goodies, which consisted of a cup of cider for each, and some nice little cakes, about the size of a dollar, and an inch thick, slightly scented with sugar, and baked so hard that a dog could n't bite them-of course they soon disappeared, Some had nibbled in vain, and finally slipped the cake in their pocket; those who had no pocket, had rolled them under the bed, or poked them through a broken pane of glass, rather, than hurt the old lady's   IN' THE' QMtUEN 'OTN .    21  feelings, by an open refusal to eat. But the old fiddler had taken something stronger, to keep in irits, and was ready to proceed. "Murther! murther!" came shrilly through the win- dow, when they all ran out to see what was the matter, and there was poor Pat bawling: " Faith, an I got badly whipped by that poor divil for cutting the horses loose from my coach, and they are gone, boo, hoo, hoo, hoo; and sure an I would have bate him, when I got him down, but he- was on the top of meself all the'while, to be sure." Pat now started in search of the horses, while George, Lizzie, and Ella started home on foot, which destination they reached about midnight. Pat reached home the next morning, but the horses had arrived before him; he fixed up the harness and went after the coach. The cause of the disaster was, that some country fellow, owing a grudge to George, had taken this mode of revenge.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7412-00000012"/> sa MTY THRMC NEGHBBOBS CHAPTER III. A FLIRTATION-VX1tING THE WATERINGi-PLACEs-A LOVER IN DIFF6ULTY. ' PA, I do think September such a sultry month, and I wish you would take me on an eastern tour pre- vious to cold weather, as I believe it would be congenial with my natural habits," said Julia Lambert to her father, who, having finished his tea, had taken a seat among the flowers, and leaned back against a sun- dial to enjoy a fine Havana. "If you are in earnest, daughter, I will accept your company, as I have to start next Monday on business; I am going to Niagara, Saratoga, New York, etc." A few additions to Julia's wardrobe, and they were off to the north. Upon the cars, Julia received several introductions to gentlemen of her father's acquaintance, which made it very pleasant as they traveled along. By the time they reached the Falls, Julia had become much attached to the humorous and entertaining gentleman, Mr. Carrot. He was fine- looking, and winning in his manners. Mr. LTambert took his leave of Julia at the Cataract Hotel, under the charge of his and her friends, who he knew would take-good care of her, while he was going farther, on business. Mr. Carrot was attentive   IN THE QaEEDN CITY. 2c3 to Julia--sometimes assisting at the piano, at, other times in a game of chess, or whist, and frequen taking a promenade with her, although it was forbid, den in the laws of Moses. "Why, how do you do, Charles Winfield " was uttered by Mr. Carrot, as they met on the balcony-- both expressing delight, as they had not met for many a long day, and yet were old acquaintances; "Well, Charles, I am glad I have met you, as I was just going away, and now I will introduce you to one of the Cincinnati ladies--a perfect belle, and you will be pleased with her acquaintance and company." "Who I who 1 " said Charles. "To a Miss Julia Lambert--a rich heiress some day, as her father is very wealthy," said Mr. Carrot. Charles resided next door to Lambert's, in the Queen City; but as he had not lived on that street but a short time, he was not acquainted with his neighbors. Julia was now sitting in the parlor, and quite lone- some, when Mr. Carrot entered, introducing Charles Winfield to her, as a companion, as he was about taking his departure. Charles and Julia were now conversing glibly, as Mr. Carrot bade them farewell, and was leaving the room. "Stop a moment, Mr. Carrot, I wanted to inquire about your wife and fiimily," said Charles. "They are all well-good-bye, Charies?"- rrot was gone. "That Mr. Carrots is a fine; jovial fellow, I have known him foryears, said Charles. 3  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7412-00000013"/> 24      MY THEE NEIGHBORS ' "I believe he is," said Julia, who-was now revolv- ing in her mind, the pleasure of wasting her affections on a married gentleman; as wae Mr. Carrot: "Mr. Winfield, you will please excuse me, as I1 wish to retire to my room, for I feel weary from dancing last evening; also some condiments that I masticated at dinner, have not been congenial with my nervous membranes." Charles thinking she had made a fine play upon words, gave an answer accordingly: "You are ex-. cusable, Miss Julia, and I must go down to the phar- maceutist and procure some of Christopher Columbus' vegetable pain extractor, as I have a severe tic dou- loureux in my face, from catching a cold last evening; so I bid you good-day,' said Charles. About this time Mr. Lambert returns, and finds Julia sitting in her room, and appearing rather dis- consolate; after some quizzing, finds that Julia had taken quite a fancy to Mr. Carrot, not knowing he was a married man; and was now abiding the dis- appointment and mortification of being duped in that manner. The old gentleman laughs heartily at the joke; while Julia thinks married men should wear a con- nubial badge, or stay at home. However, after- a night's rest, Julia seems gay as ever, and determines to forward her acquaintance with Charles Winfield, and make him the subject of a flirtation: the begin-- ning of which commenced before they left the Falls, and continued as they visited Cape May. -The side.   IN THE- QUEEN CITY.      28 dishes of this flirtation consisted in cotillion parties, confidential tete a tetes, and a few bottles of Old Nick's sparkling catawha at dinner-times. They have done with Cape May, and are now journeying homeward; have crossed the Cumberland Mountains, and arrived at Wheeling at five o'clock in the morning. Charles, instead of getting on board of the boat which was to start at nine, leaves Julia in care of her father, and seeks a little rest at a hotel-says his prayers, and retires-wakes up about ten o'clock that morning-curses the porter, for not waking him sooner-hastens down to the river just in time to see the wake of the last steamer for Cin- cinnati-finds he has left his: carpet-bag somewhere- walks back to the hotel, but cannot find it-feels like cutting his throat, but supposing his penknife gone, too, he resigns himself to his fate--cncludes to pur- chase a box of Havanas, and smoke away his troubles; but finds he had left his pockethook in his other pants, in the carpet-bag. ' Man born of a woman' is full of trouble. If I don't see Julia pretty soon I'll die." 'He now writes a letter to his mother, states all about his falling in love with an heiress-his intentions to marry; but most important, to send him some money by the next mail ; but, coan founded and absent-minded, directs the letter, to Miss Julia Lambert, Cincinnati, Ohio; and waits two weeks for the money.' In due time Julia gets the letter, supposing he had put the letter in a wrong envelope, and perhaps his *    '  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7412-00000014"/> 26      MY THRE  NESIGHBOR8 mother had one for her; but not knowing where the Winflelds resided, lays the letter away as a curiosity. Charles writes again, and waits two weeks longer; but the unfortunate mail-boat was lying aground on Wyandot Bar, without his permission or knowledge. He now picks up a newspaper to look for a situation, not liking the one he already had, as he was not making money enough to pay his hotel bill, or passage home. His eye now caught the following "Any person knowing the whereabouts of a tall young man with dark complexion, who was traveling under the cog- nomen of Charles Winfield, who left Cape May for home, some four weeks ago, will confer a favor by sending word to his distressed parents, who are afraid some evil has be- fallen him." "Confound the luck I Did any person ever have as much trouble all at once?" said Charles, as he threw down the paper. The hotel keeper noticed his emotions-ascertained a statement of his difficulty, and loaned him funds to take him home.  * ,    *   *   *  ' The yellow leaves trembling upon the fibers of the beech, in obedience to the tyrant Frost, are losing their attachment in countless numbers, and returning to the earth from* whence they came-hiding the tender plant from the coming winter., The nimble squirrel jumps from limb to limb, storing away his usual supply of food in some hollow tree.

"My dear Lizzie, how did you spend your time while-pa and I were East," said Julia, as she and Lizzie met for the first time since Julia's return, and were now strolling among Julia's flowers and shrub- bery. "I have had a rich time in the country since you left--riding on horseback, visiting thecountry peo- ple, and amusing myself at their manners and ex. pressions. To give you an idea, one day I took dinner at Mr. Jones', in the country; they had a very plain dinner, and by way of apology, he remarked, that it was a pity if I could not eat one meal of what he had to-eat all the time." "Now, Lizzie, that was pretty smart for a country fellow," remarked Julia. "Some time I must tell you about a strange party that I attended-they called it an apple-cutting. But first you must tell me about your eastern tour." "Yes, I will, and the. first thing I did, was to fall in love with a handsome gentleman;, and after a few days pleasure of his company, ascertained he was a married man; and that makes the third time I have made a fool of myself; and now I have resolved to make as many conquests as I can, for I don't care a fig about the fellows any more.

"I understand you, Julia; but what was his name a " "Ah, Lizzie, here is his card--Charles Winfield, Cincinnati, Ohio."  "Why, Julia I I knew him long before you and I were acquainted; and don't you know that his parents reside in that house adjoining your father" " "I wonder if he is at home a I left him at Wheel- ing four weeks ago, and have not seen him since,  although I gave him my residence," said Julia.  "Nor have his parents heard from him since he left Cape May. They have advertised for him,.and are nearly distracted at his absence," said Lizzie. "Why, poor fellow, I am afraid something has be- fallen him; let us go and see his parents, as I saw  him at Wheeling, and perhaps I can give them some information concerning him. Ah, there comes our girl Biddy. Well, Biddy, what do you want?" "And faith Scarles Windmill is at the dure, -and wants to see yourself."  "Come, Julia, and go into my house, for I believe that is he now." Julia and Lizzie soon} had the pleasure of meeting their old friend, Charles Winfield. "We have just been talking about you, and con- juring up various causes about your absence; now tell us about it, Charles." He here repeated a full history of everything except   INm t QUEEN crr. ' ;29 the actual cause of his delay: stating that he tstopped at Wheeling on a speculation, and the river became too low to travel, and that he had written. home, iut they had not received his letters, which was the cause of the uneasiness on the pairt of his parents. ' . Julia now arose to go home, and Charles offered his company. But Julia replied, it was but a few steps- to her father's gate-she bade them good-night. "Ah, she is light as a fairy, and graceful as a queen," said Charles, who had been watching her- hasty steps, ' Charles, you must be in love I Now take a little advice from your friend Lizzie; don't be offended at me, but I do not want you to fall in love with Julia, and be rejected, with one corner of your heart knocked off; then mope around society with a face as long as Deacon Grimes'." "Ha. ha, Julia I I am much obliged to you, but I can take care of number one." "That is a pretty good joke, you called me Julia. Now that speaks a volume, and I know that she has already made a conquest of you; and Julia has -so many admirers, that it is a question who will ever be the happy man to receive her hand." "Lizzie, I will remember what you say, it is get- ting late, and I bid you farewell for this evening."' Charles is in his. room. "I cannot help thinking how kindly interested Lizzie is in my affairs, but I believe she is a little jealous herself; but I must now look over father's books, as I see he has left them  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7412-00000016"/> 80      MY THREE NEIQBBQORS here.

CITY people would have as much hospitality and friendship as the farmer, were it not for numberless elements averse to such characteristics. The all ab- sorbing business of the day brings into action the entire mental force of man, leaving neither time nor opportunity for development of the finer feelings: "Calls man from his couch at early dawn, Or haunts his soul and body all night long With dearest friends he has no time to stay, Nor to his Maker has he time to pray." Pushed alongi by the rapid current of money changers, each one, grasping to hold fast, lest he be crushed to beggary, an eat rich food or sup his wins at home, but cannot exchange affection with his fellow- men.

"I wonder who it can be-there, he is helping a woman out of the wagon-just look what a bonnet I Ma, I do believe it is Uncle Jake Lambert from the country." "Yes, it is, daughter. Go down and tell Patrick to hitch it in front of Mr, Lane's house, for I would not have Gooseback's nor Blickford's folks to see it in front of our house for a kingdom; and besides, that horse will injure that shade-tree.

Mrs. Lambert kisses. her sister-in-law with her under-lip, and kisses Brother Jake with the side of her face. "Oh no, we cannot stay a week or two, but I am going a little farther on business, and will leave my wife here while I am absent for a few days. There are some pumpkins and sweet potatoes out in the wagon, that I brought you for a present, and I will bring them in." "u0 no, let Pat do that." Pat drives the wagon around through the back alley, and takes in the vegetables through the back gate. The. next morning Mrs. Betsy Lambert talks of taking a walk to see the' city and do some shopping,   IN THE QUEEN MCrr.      33 asks the Hon. Mrs. Lambert to accompany her,-who does not feel well enough to venture out. Mrs. Betsy starts out by herself, having a memorandum of dry goods, groceries and shoes to purchase, as well as a determination to see the sights. "' Now, Julia, you have a little leisure, you must write a letter to your cousin Ella Blair, and I shall dictate some sentiments and language while you per- form the penmanship. Now, dear, as you are not accustomed to corresponding, you must commence your letter with 'Affectionate Cousin,' and then state how many engagements you have with young gentle- men to attend the opera, theater and Swiss Bell ring- ers, etc., and how many new dresses, and what style you are having them made. You must use some quo- tations from Byron or Shakespeare, also, pretty words here and there; now, 'oblivion' is a very pretty word; try and use that while I think of something else. You must invite your cousin Ella to come and make us a visit, but I do hope she will come before your holiday parties." "Now Ma, I am tired of writing and must prepare to go callingi after dinner.

Well, what did you see that amused you I " "I saw so much that I can hardly tell you all; and what was strange, I went to a store and bought me a iustre dress, and then asked for some molasses and sal- eratus, but they didn't have any like they do out in the count where 1 live; and then I saw those long cow sheds where they were selling meat, and was down to the river and saw the steamboats. "The next thing that attracted my attention was a sign of the Greek Slave, and I went up stairs, paid a quarter, and when I got in she was not dressed yet, and I ran like a streak.

After tea Julia is amusing herself at the piano as Mr. Charles Winfield presents himself to her come pany. After the usual salutations Charles insists on a continuation of vocal music, while, of course, Julia insists on her bad cold as an excuse. "Indeed, Julia, you can sing, for I heard your sweet voice just as I rang the, bell' "Charles, you are making fun of me." "Indeed, I am not." "Well, if you are in earnest, I will sing something- but what shall it be? "Anything that you choose," said Charles.

"Now, Julia, let us have a confab about that tour we enjoyed so much, and conjure up another one for next summer." "Charles, I would be pleased with another tour, but that is too far off. I am now planning my parties for the winter; and expect to have a fine time, and you may have a season ticket. And for amusement, we will have tableaux, and play the Lady of Lyons at one of my parties, and I want you to be Claude Melnotte."   &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7412-00000019"/> 36      MY TMRY C NEIGHmBOBm "O, I would rather be lion among the ladies," said Charles. "Ahem, you are quite a, punster this evening." The conversation is here interrupted. "Well, Kitty, what do you want?" "Mr. Biscuit is at the door, and wants to see yourself." "Go and send him in. How I do hate that Mr. Blister; he is always calling on the ladies, and I never knew him to spend a cent for them in his life. He is so penurious, that a shilling before his face would hide the market-house."' Mr. Blister enters-exit Charles--Julia enters into a dry conversation with Blister, at the same time planning some trick, by which she might drop his society, as he was not as liberal as his circumstances would permit, and the ladies generally knew it. Julia had a plan, but wanted company, and proposed introducing him to ,hercompanion, Lizzie Lane, who resided next door; at the same time remarking, that she was a pleasant lady, with whom he would be pleased ,. He consented, and soon they were seated in Liizzie's company. The conversation was, of course, on general topics, until Julia remarked, with affected surprise: "O, Lizzie have you seen that beautiful saloon, just opened on Walnut street, for ladies, where you can get oysters and sweetmeats in style " "Yes, I saw it, Julia; but I have not had the' pleasure of visiting it yet," remarked Lizzie.   IN THE QUEEN cdTY.      37 Of course Mr. Blister could not do otherwise than ask the ladies if they would go and patronize the new saloon; but hoping,:at the same time, that it was too late, or looked too-much like rain. "Lizzie, it is not too late," remarked Julia, at the same time looking at her waatch, 'it is only half-past nine." "If you think best, Julia, we will accept the invita- tion." With this, the ladies put on their shawls, and Mr. Blister, seeing no way to retrograde, picked up his hat, and they walked out of the door. "Why, I do believe it sprinkles," said Mr. B. "Yes, I felt a drop on my hand, but there is a large umbrella in the hall,' said Lizzie, who, with the word, reached it, and handed it to Mr. Blister. Julia was pleased, for she determined to have some oysters.., They now promenade along Eighth street to Walnut, when it commences sprinkling pretty fast, and Mr. B. expresses a fear that they will get wet, and catch cold. "O, no!" says Julia, "it is bad luck to turn back, let us go on now, since we have come this far." So they proceed down Walnut street to the saloon. Ah, here it is, what a splendid saloon, all lighted up with gas, reflecting on the gilded cornice and marble-top tables. Now they seat themselves around, one of the tables. "Ladies, what will yon havet" said a waiter, who was standing ready. t,    ,  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7412-00000020"/> 38      MY lr;THBJ NEGHtfBOgSo "I will take a half dozen, stewed," said Julia. Ditto, Lizzie, and also Mr. Blister. The servant returned with oysters for three. "Anything else, ladies," said the waiter, as he sat them on the table I "(Of course we want some crackers, and butter, and milk to eat with them," said Julia, without looking to see whether there was not already a sufficient quantity served up with them, however the servant obeyed without a murmer. Mr. Blister now resolved in his mind, at least, that a dollar was gone to its long home; and- did  not even  enjoy the oysters. However, by the time the oysters were dispatched, the servant passed that way.  "Anything else, ladies f" Julia looked around: "O yes, some of that fruit- cake, and those macaroni, would please me just now." They were accordingly brought and served up in like manner. "Mr. Blister, I am much obliged to you for this treat; but I believe it is the first time you were ever out with us," said Julia. "Yes, I think it is the last time," said Mr. B. "Why, what is the matter; are you afraid you will be sick and die, from over-eating V" remarked Julia. "Let us go, it is getting late," said Lizzie; and they arose to depart. Mr. Blister now walks up to the desk, and calls for the bill. "'Three dollars and forty cents," says the clerk.    W Tas Quln Ct -O ,      89 "Well, sir, I came out this evening unexpectedly-- have no funds, but will call in the morning and settle," said Mr. Blister. "No, sir, we don't do business in that way. You have eaten your refreshrlents, now you can pay for them, you pusillanimous, penurious, infernal--" "Stop I stop l" cried Julia, " don't insult the'gentle. man; he will settle, and here is my diamond ring and breast-pin, as collateral security. He will settle this in the morning."' The clerk was satisfied, and they walk toward home, where Mr. Blister bade them farewell, and used his last five cent piece in getting over the river: for the fact was, that he never took along funds, more than sufficient to pay ferriage, for fear he would spend it; but the next morning he called and settled the bill Wand sent the jewelry home. Mr. Blister has since sworn eternal exclusion from the society of females, and has a particular dielike to oysters. Julia often laughs at iow she sold a penurious beau; but Lizzie deeply sympathized with the poor fellow. 4  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7412-00000021"/> 40      MY Ta- K '1 NEIGHBORS CHAFPTER iV TEI PAUr--NEW YEn's DAY-'   'As P"BTT.

Since she is coming, I will write her another letter, giving her a cordial invitation to my party, and I will give her a hint that the party is going to be a grand one, and perhaps she will replenish her wardrobe or postpone her visit until after the party." "And it is the top of the morning to ye, Miss Ella, and be sure I got a letter for yourself, at tMe Goshen post-office this morning," said Patrick.

DEAREST COUSIN :-'It is with the most profound pleas- ! ure that I address you at this time, anticipating the hap- piness of your company during the holidays. I also give  you a welcome to my party on New Year's eve, which will be a grand entertainment of the recierche style.- You will  have an opportunity of seeing the height of the fashion in dress, the rich brocade and brilliant satin. My company will be composed of the aristocracy of the Queen City. Your cousin, JULIAA AMBERT.

' Yes, an' faith, wont I be ,: there myself to be sure An' isn't it meself that goes in the same society. I will drive the coach and take J Miss Ella there, and while July Lambkin is talking to  the fellows in the parloor, I'll be after talking to Kitty Lambkin by the kitchen fire, as I always go in the first circle, since I left Dooblin."  "Now, ma," said Ella, "I understand that letter. She would not have written so soon again if she did not mean something. She describes the party in that manner either to discourage me from coming, or, if I do, to make a fine appearance. I know Julia so well tft she cannot deceive me, and the fact is, I am determined to go."   *        *    * The day of the party arrived, and Patrick, with his  '          Si 1   IN THE QUEEEN OITo.      45 coach in fine order, took Ella into the city, and left her at Lizzie Lane's, as she thought best to remain with Lizzie until evening and then go with her to the party.  "Ma, it is strange that Ella has not come. I think she must be sick. To-night is my party and she will not be here. I thought that letter would fix the mat- ter," said Julia.  The long looked for New' Year's eve had now ap- proached. The last sun of the old year had gone to rest, throwing a dark mantle about the Queen City.  to the young and gay there seemed majestic greatness a the approaching night. The daily din had ceased, the mass had closed their doors against the cold and wintry wind. All was hushed save now and then a lively group, wending their way to a private party or public ball. The upper class were reveling in a parlor dance with their-selected friends. The poor were gathered around their scanty meal or bright fire-  side to spend a homely yet happy evening. The low were reeling in a bar-room dance. The old town clock was striking nine as Charles Winfield, in company with Lizzie Lane and Ella Blair, was introduced -to the company at Julia TLarn irt's. Who could have been more surprized than Julia to see her cousin, and pleased to see her look so well. Ella wore a rich satin robe with a neat and careless sash about her waist. Her style of dress exposed as symmetrical a neck and arm as could be seen that   &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7412-00000024"/> "     AMY TH  E NEIIGHBORS eve. Miss Ella was a merry sou1, with laughing eye and more than cnmmon sense. Miss Julia with her diamonds, And Charles with /oin cravat, Miss Lizzie 'mong the beau monde Attraction gave for "a' that." The parlor walls now echo with the happy confusion of a hundred voices, all life and gaiety, as if a care or trouble had never entered their tender hearts, just as it should he at such a time. Here a group delighted with some joke, and there a few were planning out charades, while a full circle were on the carpet play- ing Copenhagen. Julia now has an opportunity to converse with Ella-ascertains that she has been acquainted with Lizzie a year or two, and also that Charles had frequently taken Lizzie out to visit Ella, etc., all of which were news to her. In the meantime, Charles is seated at the piano, with his large hands spread upon the keys, as if to tear them from their place, while his moustache and underlip meet and separate to the words of "love not." Meantime some gents in the opposite corner, are commenting on his position, and sweet, angelie voice; which they said was spoiled by whistling against the wind, when he was young. Another moment finds Charles entertaining some ladies, by expatiating on an oil painting--"The Coli- seum by Moonlight," which scene he supposes is taken Somewhere in New England.   IN THE QUEEN crrY.      47 We now see Miss Ella in full glee, and cheerfully conversing with several young gentlemen, with whom she was well acquainted long previous to the party. A slight change of programme now takes place, from the entrance of two old cremonas, under the arms of a pair of modern Paganinis, who initiate themselves with the tune of Fisher's Hornpipe, sud. denly diminishing the specific gravity of each indi- vidual, as if by magic. Life and hilarity join them in the dance--time speeds faster now. The last sechottische was changed into a march, that brought them around the festal board. The pyramids of frozen cream, the southern grapes, and oysters a la mode, with various kinds of cake and wine, were introduced to Julia's guests, who had earned the food by the sweat of the brow that very evening in the dance. As wine is the mother of wit, you can imagine the puns and toasts that were brought into existence and expired the same evening. The rich repast was soon over, when they returned to the parlor to renew the chase. It was two o'clock when they adjourned, and ten in the morning when some of them  arose witha viile headache. How many friends Miss Lizzie made that evening, or how many admirers Miss Ella had, 'we cannot say; but that Charles made some advances upon Julia's affections, was established beyond a doubt. New Year's day had now arrived, with all its pleasures-business was generally suspended.

Thou parlor serpent, whose lips do bum With slanderous words most foul, Deny thy name, in thy duplicity, And charge them to innocent. THE holidays have passed. Ella Blair having made a happy visit in the city and returned home, this evening, receives a visit from George Henore, entertains him with a glowing description of Julia's party and city enjoyments, then, learns that George is going to the city to reside and finish his studies pre- paratory to a legal profession. Ella teases George about going to the city on Lizzie Lane's account, knowing that he admired Lizzie, and that it would be so convenient to spend his evenings at 'Squire Laneys. Sudden changes of affairs are now in embryo. We introduce Mrs. Pettifroid; she was known in society as a kind-hearted, good-natured- and enter- ttaining old lady; fluent in conversation, knowing everybody's pedigree from Alpha to Omega. She was an intimate friend of the Lanes, and they never had cause to doubt her sincerity. She was, therefore, welcome to their house, and frequently staid a week or two at a time, although she lived  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7412-00000026"/> O0      MY THREE NEIGHBORS but a short distance from the city. Mrs. Pettifroid was slightly acquainted with the Lamberts, but not so intimate as she wished to be, for she was very fond of the best society. This evening, however, she was at Mr. Lane's house. Tea being over, they were conversing about things in general, until the conversation finally turned upon the Lambert family, when Mrs. Pettifroid remarked that she had known the Lamberts for years, and that it was an enigma, to many people, how he had grown so rich and amassed so much property in such a few years, and yet he did not seem to follow any business. Yet Mrs. Pettifroid knew, and, of course, they must not say anything about it, but the fact was that he had been fraudulent in land speculations, and also was a gambler. So stated Mrs. Pettifroid. "Is it possible?" remarked Lizzie, "I never should have thought of such a thing. I knew he owned a fortune in that homestead, yet I did not know from whence came his income, as that is all the property that he owns to my knowledge." The conversation is here interrupted by the ap- pearance of George Lenore, at which time also Mrs. P. takes her departure. A few evenings after this we peep into Mr. Lain- bert's family circle and find them conversing about Mr. Lane's folks. "My dear husband, we must be a little more particular about Julia's company. Now she thinks there is no one like Lizzie Lane, and if she associ-   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      51 ates with!Lizzie she will have to become acquainted with her beaux also, and then, that George Lenore visits her so frequently that I am so afraid, our daughter will become attached to him. He may be a very nice young man, but Julia must look pp for some one more aristocratic," said Mrs. Lambert. "That is all true; and that house of Mr. 'Lane's is looking quite shabby, and I wish it was torn down anal that they were out of the neighborhood, although they seem like nice people, yet I must take some plan to get this square to looking genteel if I have to buy that house and build a finer one in its place," said Mr. Lambert. "Yes, and this morning they turned off that poor Irish Catholic girl and accused her of stealing a dozen silver spoons, and I don't believe that they ever had a dozen; and, besides, I don't believe that Bridget would steal, for she has such a good coun- tenance. I will hire her myself," said Mrs. Lam- bert. Just then a rap was heard on Mrs. Lambert's door and Kitty made her appearance. "And Kitty, what do you want this time of night ." "An' would you be afther thinking that Mrs. Lane has turned off Bridget, and that she wants a place to sleep, and is looking for a place to work!" said Kitty. "Tell Bridget that she can stay with you to-night,  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7412-00000027"/> 852      MY THRrT NEIGHBORS and that to-morrow I will speak to her about a place to work." On the following day Mrs. Lambert engages Bridget as a chambermaids In the evening when Bridgpt is setting to rights the sitting-room of Mrs.; Lambert, Mrs. L. thinks it a good opportunity to quiz Bridget about family affairs at Lane's. Of course Bridget- could not speak well about a family who had just turned her off; thus the conversation resulted in a partial statement not creditable to the Lanes. Bridget stated that she heard the Lanes say that Mr, Lambert was a gambler, and also that he had obtained his property by swindling. "That will do, Bridget, go down and help Kitty," said Mrs. Lambert. "My Heavens, they shall suf- fer for this vile talk; I never did like that family, and I shall never be contented until I get them out of this neighborhood," remarked Mrs. Lambert, just as her husband entered. "What is the matter now, wife, that you seem so irritated?" said Mr. L. "There is enough the matter; those Lane's keep me in hot water all the time: in the first place, I don't like such plain homespun neighbors, and what is worse, they have been talking awfully about us, and particularly of yourself. This Bridget that is working for us, lived at Lane's before she -came here, and to night she told me a great mess of slang that the Lane's said about you, which   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      53 amounted to your getting your property by swindling, and that you was a gambler, etc. "What do you want now, Bridget " said Mrs. Lambert who was interrupted. M" rs. Pettifroggy is down to the door, and wants to know if you are at home," said Bridget. "Yes, send her up stairs. Now I will find out more- as Mrs. Pettifroid is a visitor of the Lane family, and if any person has ever heard them say anything about our family, she is the one" contin- ued Mrs. L. Mrs. Pettifroid enters. After cordial salutations and some conversation about things in general,-they gradually slide into a confab about their neighbors, furnishing a good opportunity (which was accepted by MrF. Lambert) to ascertain if Mrs. P. had ever heard anything confirming what Bridget had said. "Mrs. PEttifroid, I wish to know if ever you heard the Lanes say anything reflecting deleteriously upon my husband's character!" C"You know, sister Lambert, that I would not keep anything from you, and since you have asked me, I feel it my duty to tell you all I heard; now mind, it is confidential, and amounts to this: I was there one evening, and heard Lizzie state that Mr. Lambert was a gambler, and that he had made his property by swindling, and, in fact, the talk was scandalous about your husband. Now, as I said, I hope you will not mention this, as they will try to palm it on to me or some one else," remarked Mrs. Pettifroid.  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7412-00000028"/> 54      Mt -Tuis. EIGHBOB8, "L'Tis abominable;- I will ferret out the whole matter, and I will take them up for slander: not to get money out of them, but to frighten them and other people from talking about the Lamberts; so that even if they know anything, they will not dare to open their months about us," said Mrs. Lambert, quite agitated. "Now, I do hope that you will not mention my name in the affair, as they would think strange for one who had visited their house a thousand times, to mention what had been said in social conversation," said Mrs. Pettifroid, as she bade them good-night. During this same evening, Miss Lizzie Lane was at home, entertaining her friend, Mr George Lenore, as Mrs. Pettifroid made a short call, and departed; after which Lizzie took occasion to speak of her, remarking, that she thought Mrs. Pettifroid was such a sweet woman-kind-hearted and generous to every one, and she loved her, because in all times of difficulty or sickness that she had been a kind, attentive, and sympathizing friend. , "O yes," said George, "that much may be true, but she has an object in all this; and I am afraid her bump of self-interest is larger than that of benevolence. You know that she lives near our house in the coun- try, when she is at home, and I have a good oppor. tunity to know as much as any one. 1 venture she was alwaysw hinting at you to give her this old silk dress, or that fancy apron, which, of course, you could not refuse; and the fact is, that she never pretends to   IN THE QULN OIT.       553 buy anything for her children, as she is acquainted in so many families where she can take the same privi- lege; but that is not all, for I believe self-interest is the sole foundation of her acts' of kindness, and that she is deceitful; but I do not expect to convince you of it," said George Lenore. ' No, indeed, George, I could believe anything else easier; for we have been acquainted with her so long, that it would be hard to convince me so contrary to my long established opinion, unless I should see some. thing corroborating your statement; but I beg pardon for differing with you," said Lizzie Lane. Here the conversation terminated concerning Mrs. Pettifroid. During this evening, Julia Lambert was at home, in company with her choice friend and admirer, Charles Winifield; both of whom seemed delighted in each other's society. His visits were more frequent now than usual, as he wished to enjoy the time as much as possible previous to his departure for Europe, which -he contemplated in the coming spring. The evening being far spent in building air-castles, offend- ing and pardoning, a little pouting, etc., Charles bids her good-night, and departs. "Come, Julia, I wish to talk with you a few minutes," said Mrs. Lambertr who met her at the head of the stairs, and they seated themselves in,- Julia's room. "What do you wish to say this time of night, ma P" said Julia,.

Now, the Lane family .,are,.-not wealthy enough for your society, and a am going to put a stop to your visitsig them at all; and, besides, if you know how they talked about. us you would shun them entirely. That Lizzie, that you think so much of, has reported that your father is a gambler and swindler, and dear knows what she has not said." "I do not believe it--I know it is false,' said Julia. "O yes, you will take their part, but that will do no good; for I will not be content until I make them sorry for it, and I will never let them have any peace in this neighborhood," said Mrs. Lambert, -as she left Julia alone. Julia slept but little that night, knowing that she could not restrain her mother, and fearing she might lose her friend and companion, Lizzie Lane. During these winter days and long evenings, the Winfields, especially the better half of the family, were engaged with duplicate labors. They were not only busy in making cloaks and mantillas for a store, but were replenishing Charles' wardrobe for his spring tour. Yes, making mantillas for a store; but that was a private affair, and no one's business but their own: and by that means, Kate and her mother had made enough not only to live comfortably, but could spare enough for Oharles to make a visit to Europe. They thought if Charles could make a tour to the old world, that [is accomplishments would be complete-   IN THM QUBEB OITY.      t7 he would not only be respected in society, but. he could then marry whom he pleased; and they were very desirous to see their only son do well in that most important event of life; yet it was going to be almost an affliction to have Charles leave them for such a length of time.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7412-00000030"/> t68      MY TRKWM NEIGHBOB8 C CHA  *PT E R         \I. THE TRIAL-COMMENCEMENT OF TROUBLES. Behind the thickest cloud, the sun shines bright; Then why despair? 'Twill not be always night. "T is strange that I have not seen Julia Lambert for two weeks," said Lizzie Lane to her ma; "we used to be together every evening until lately; and when I called last evening and did notsee her, I knew she was at home, for I saw her pass the window up stairs as I was coming out the gate. I do hope I have done nothing to offend 'her, as she is my choicest com- panion."     /  Just then the door bell rang; presently Bridget handed them a document from the hand of the sheriff. Lizzie opened it and read to her ma: State of Ohio, Hamiiton County. C ASr oF LAMPBERT v.

Case set on the first day of April-damages five thousand dollars. Had Gabriel with the last trump appeared, they would-not have been more astonished than by this event.   IN THE QUEEN OITY.      59 "Why, ma, what can this mean? there must be some mistake, and how it will astonish pa. I don't believe he would rest a minute this whole night. Let us not give it to him until morning, and then, perhaps, he can inquire into the matter." "'CO no, that will not do, daughter; there he is, coming through the hall." Mr. Lane enters-they hand him the unfortunate document. The old gentleman perused the docu. ment, and in an agitated manner, threw it upon the floor as he exclaimed, "My daughter, we are ruined I Have you ever said anything against the Lamberts?" "Indeed, father, I have never uttered a word against them in my life." "Then there must be some mistake about the matter, at least I hope so, for that amount would turn us out of doors," said the old gentleman. "Come, father, don't worry yourself about it; perhaps I imay see Julia to-morrow and find out what it means. As we are innocent, I don't think any evil will come out of it, although it is an awful thing to be accused of slander." They parted for the night with heavy hearts. On the following day as Mr. Lane was walking out he met Mr. Lambert on the street. "Good morning, Mr. Lambert, I wish to speak a few words to you." "Don't speak to me, sir," said Mr. Lambert, and passed on indignantly.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7412-00000031"/> 60      U V TRtBMEE NEIGHBOfiS "Welly that is strange," thought Mr. Lane to himself. "I cannot see through it. There seems to be something wrong, but I am not going to let it trouble me, as I know my family have not been guilty of the charge." This seemed to be the griteat trouble that had ever befallen the Lanes. They had always lived com- fortably within themselves and peaceably with their neighbors; and now to be accused of a vile slander, of which they were innocent, grieved the whole family; and for it to become public, that they were tattlers and mischief-makers, seemed to them a greater slander than that of which they were charged. "Fatheri, did you see any of the Lamberts to-day, to. ascertain what was the meaning of all this?" said Lizzie, as her pa came home to dinner. "My daughter, I met Mr. Latnbert and spoke to him, but he passed me in a!most indignant man. ner, so that I learned nothing from him; but I am convinced that there is something wrong." "I must try and see Julia this evening or as soon as possible," said Lizzie, "and she will tell me all about it; for I think'she is a true friend of mine, and if she is angry she will tell me, for we agreed never to let any one make mischief between us, without divulging everything to each other, and if she has an ill-feeling against any of us, she will tell me the cause." - The evening came along and you may have seen the Hon. Mr. Lambert and lady on their way to   'IN THE QUEEN CITY.      61 church, for it. was Wednesday evening, and they were seldom absent from the sanctuary) on that night. She was a good member of the Universalist Church, and he accompanied her for appearache sake, but had never united with them, although a strong believer that he would nevertheless be saved. Julia was of the same opinion with regard to hersef, and did not go at all, 'but thought it a good time to steal a call on her friend Lizzie, which her parents  would oppose were they at home. A few moments found Julia at Lizzie's door. Presently they might have been seen walking the parlor with an arm about each other's waist, as if they had not met' for a year. "Now, Julia, why have you not been in to see me for so long a time? I have really feared you were angry," said TIizzie. "'You know it was not my fault, for I love you as much as any one can, but from some strange notions of my mother, she would not permit me to call. I suppose you have heard of sode unpleasant things between our families, have you not, Lizzie?" "Indeed I have, and. cannot understand what it means." "In the first place, Lizzie, you must not think strangely of what I say, for I must speak candidly, and rest assured that, if possible, I am a more firm friend of yours than ever. You know, Lizzie, that my ma is so proud that there is hardly any one igood enough for her or my associates, and she does  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7412-00000032"/> 62      MY THREE NEIGHBORS not even want me to associate with you; then, with the assistance of some mischief-making persons, she believes that your folks have injured my father's character by saying that he is a gambler," etc. "But we have never spoken a word against your father." "No difference, Lizzie; she wants an excuse to break up our intimacy, which she can never do." "'But, Julia, who could have told your mother that we said such things about your father, when there is not a word of truth in it " said Lizzie. "Do not weep, Lizzie, I know you were never guilty of slandering any one, and I dare not tell you who are the mischief-makers, at present, for fear of nimaking further trouble: but I will tell you some other time, and, in the mean time, will use my in- fluence'in your favor as far as I can without seem- ing interested, as that would frustrate my efforts. Come, Lizzie, cheer up, and remember that you have a true friend in me. One who will intercede for you, and repair any injury that you may receive from this affair, so far as is in my power. I must hasten home for fear my folks might find me- here." Julia bade Lizzie good-night with a kiss, and they parted. Lizzie was alone with her unpleasant feelings, yet the kind whrds and promises of Julia gave her some comfort. The next morning Lizzie told oher father all that Julia had said, which gave him some relief in the matter, although he was still in suspense as'to how the' matter would terminate.   IN THE QUIEN CITn.       63 Julia sought relief by taking her-;little -basket' upon her arm, in which were stored substantials and sweatmeats, and seeking' .the outskirts of, the city, where she could find hungry children and feed them from her basket,+ which was one of her great- est pleasures. At this time,% you might see her enter the humble cot of Joel Burner who seemed to be the most destitute of any among her objects of charity. This morning she finds them with their last stick of wood upon the fire, and both hovering close to -it: while the old woman was, repairing some clothing, the old man sat smoking his pipe, which seemed to be a great comfort in his old age. When Julia entered he laid down his pipe as if it were sacrilege to smoke in her presence. Julia seated herself upon a wooden chair, and fully learned their condition before taking her leave. When she re- turned' home she sent them a load of wood and some marketing, thinking she would assist them all she could this winter, for it was doubtful whether she could the next from the, present state of affairs. Lizzie seemed to let this Lambert affair trouble her, and, in fact, sundry circumstances made the balance, of the winter rather gloomy in many re- spects, to our Three Neighbors. There was the Winfield family fretting about Charles' journey to Europe, as if they would never see him again. Hlowever, that was natural enough, , as he was an only son and doated on 'more than usual. 6  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7412-00000033"/> "      MY THRUt HEWIGifBORS But the young folks would have some enjoyment in each other's society, not burdening themselves with cares, as is too much the case with the old folks. Lizzie Lane's most pleasant hours were those spent in company with her admirer, George Lenore, who had made many calls since his residence in the city; for her attachment had become generally known, as was'also the fact that it was reciprocated by him, and that he had proposed to her and been accepted; but they had named a day sufficiently distant to let him establish a business in the Queen City, which would perhaps take a year or two. Strange to say, that although George had avowed his attachment to Lizzie, yet he stole a call occasion- ally on the fascinating Miss Julia Lambert. Lizzie knew it, and was jealous-fearing that Julia'snwinning ways might make a breach in her future happiness. Julia's parents were aware of, and entirely objected to Lenore's visits to their daughter; because he was from the country, and not fashionable. Oldr M. Lambert was heard to -say, in pointed language, "My daughter, that George Lenore visits you too often. I am getting old, and if ever you should'marry him, I will haunt you after I am dead." Julia paid little attention to what her father said, nor did she think so much of George Lenore as'her' parents supposed, for she had many as worthy ad&amp;  mirers, who visited her as often as George. The very gentlemanly scholar and exquisite Mr. Charles Win.- field who was the idol of Julia Lambert, and who, in   IN THE QUEEiXN CIT' .     65 the agony of his soul, had bowed in humble sub- mission, besought Julia, an angel of mercy, to accept his protection down the stream of life. Julia ac- cepted--the grand nuptial ceremonies to take place after his return from Europe.           ' Time rolled on, and the first day of April, which was set for the trial of the Lanes for libel, came around; although they were in hopes that it would amount to nothing, they made their appearance in the court room, according to the summons, but it was no ruse, for there they met the Lamberts, in full earnest to carry out what they had commenced. The case was called, and the first witness on the stand was -Bridget O'Finnigan, the girl that Mrs. Lane had turned off for taking; things, and who wask now at Lambert's: the amount of her testimony was, that she had heard Lizzie Lane say that Mr. Lambert was a gambler, etc Next witness was the amiable peace-maker, Mrs. Pettifroid, who testified in words corroborating that of the first witness; which was sufficient on the part of the plaintiff. Now Mr. Lane's family, of course, were not permitted to testify in their own favor, as to whether they had ever said anything about the Lam- berts, and therefore had no defense to offer. The jury retired, and soon made their appearance with a verdict in Lambert's favor, to the amount of two thousand dollars, for injury done to his family. This result seemed to bear heavily upon the old  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7412-00000034"/> "      MY THREE NEIGRBORS. gentleman, Mr. Lane, as he was not in funds sufficient to pay this unjust verdict, and what few dollars he had, were necessary for the demands of his family. The only chance left, seemed to be the selling of their homestead, and that must be done soon, as the law suffered no delay. Mr. Lane now ordered his lawyer to seek a purchaser for his house. In a few days Mr. Lambert concluded to purchase the Lane premises, which was valued at five thousand dollars. The terms agreed upon, Mr. Lambert paid im three thousand dollars, and that settled it. Now the trial of leaving their beloved home was at hand-the old, familiar walls would soon know them no more. It is hard to bid farewell to old associations. They were not long in suspense as to where they should find a new home, for Mr. Lane was fortunate in purchasing a- neat cottage on the opposite side of the street; an humble yet respectable dwelling. They now commenced gathering up their household goods, removing the little ornaments from the mantlepiece, and storing'them away; taking down the lold corner- clock, that. had not been disturbed for years, and bringing down from the gallery little toys and gar* ments, reminding Lizzie of the days of her childhood. Poor Lizzie I she went about the house with tears in lier eyes, and, could hardly see what she was taking hold of, nor understand why all this trouble had come upon them, and dreading the introduction to a strange dwelling; but the work went on, and we soon find them comfortably established in their new home.

But it was no use to grieve, they determined to bid good-bye to the old homestead, and become reconciled to their new home; yet there was something that seemed-to cast a gloom over Lizzie's mind-she could not disclose it to any one, or, at least, expect much sympathy if she did: for if she had brought this trouble upon her parents in their old age, and had the name of a tattler in society, then every one would shun her. Ah! that is what brought the gloom upon her brow.  But, no; Lizzie's old acquaintances did not forget her, nor did they) think her guilty of the charge, knowing too well, that they had never heard her speak ill of any one; they visited her as frequently in her new home as before, and sympathized with her, and cheered her up as much as possible. If anything was said about the case, a few words from Lizzie were sufficient to establish her innocence: for it was but reasonable to suppose that an angry servant would seek revenge in that manner. .Yet it was an enigma hiow a professed lady, who had partaken of their hos- pitality a thousand times; had received many presents at their hands, and had enjoyed their friendship and confidence, could fabricate words, and testify against them, as Mrs. Pettifroid had done, unless to clear her- self from the charge, and, by pretended friendship, fp  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7412-00000035"/> 68       r THREE NEIGHBORS establish herself more firmly with the Lamberts, as they were wealthy, which might: be more advanta- geous to her hereafter.  Mrs. Pettifroid almost made her home at Lamberts, and everything was done to make her comfortable, except on Julia's part: for she despised Mrs. P., which was natural enough, while she sympathized with Lizzie Lane. But Mrs. Pettifroid soon had a chill put on her expectations 'from the Lamberts: as one day in a jest :she-remarked to Mrs. Lambert, that she ought to bequeath her that Lane- house, as it 'did not cost them much. Mrs. Lambert made no reply, but thought Mrs. P. 'was more in, earnest than jesting, and from that time never seemed to have so much regard for her, but was rather of the opinion that Mrs. P. expected rewards for her volunteered services.  One evening after Mrs. P. had, gone to her home, and- Mr. Tambert and his wife were chattering buisily in the drawingroom, Julia thought it a good oppor. tunity to make an evening call, and soon we see her and Lizzie Lane spending a few happy moments to. gether, as if no difficulty had occurred between their families. Although lulgh Julia a vain, haughty girl; yet Lizzie's home was a mansion for her.

Thus it is, that two hearts beating in unison must fondly love, or, rce er8a, must vilely hate; while the former, united hearts, send and -receive roses of affection, without thorns, the latter exchange thorns without a rose. Julia and Lizzie had let the evening, pretty well advance, in general conversation, but Julia wished to converse on the late -troubles of the Lane family, yet felt a delicacy in approaching the subject, for fear of arousing unpleasant thoughts in Lizzie's mind. How- ever, an opportunity offbred, as Lizzie remarked how natural their old house looked, across the street, and how remindful of former happy days. "Come, Lizzie, since you mentioned the old home- stead, I want you to tell me all about your affairs, and, perhaps I can cheer you up on that subject." Lizzie sat with tears stealing down her cheeks, while she gave Julia a full statement of her affairs. Julia learned that evening, that Mr. Lane only pos- sesed the cottage they now lived in, and that his means, for their subsistence might not last more than two or three years, even with economy; and that their late loss had fallen heavily upon Mr. Lane. "Never mind, Lizzie, my parents are getting old, and if they lenae me any property when they die, I shall refund double your loss; and in the meantime, shall lend you every assistance in my power;, I will remember my vows," said Julius' as she bade Lizzie good-night.   * ,.         * "   &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7412-00000036"/> o70      MY THREE NEIGHBORS This had been a busy week with the Winfields, for they, were all busy in preparing Charles' wardrobe for his European tour. His mother and Kate had pre- pared many a little article of comfort and convenience, and stored them away in his trunk, to be discovered when he was far away. How many times his good old mother had taken him one side, and given him a lecture against the temptations of the world; and the last thing was to put a Bible in his trunk: taking good care to slip it down to the bottom, for fear he mighlt throw it out before he took his departure: knowing that if it remained until he was away, hle would thlen keep it, out of respect.  The last evening that Charles spent in the city, before his departure, was in sweet communion withi Julia Lambert. They were happy hours, because of the mutual affection: to love and be loved, was their greatest joy. Yet there was gloom 'mid all the pleasures, as they conversed upon his departure by to-morrow's sun, the great distance, and long absence about to intervene. The evening is now advanced, and Charles bids Julia an Affectionate farewell; at the same time placing in her hand a miniature, neatly encased in a gold necklace, requesting that she should wear it, in remembrance of him, during his absence. A few moments found Charles at home with his mother and sisters, and they were determined that he should not find much repose, as they were rather jealous that he had spent so much of the evening with some young lady; so the best thing he could do, was   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      71 to sit up the balance of the night, and then the cars would not leave him in the morning, which was ac- cordingly done, and in the morning he took his depar- ture for the East.

"You don't, hey I Well, it is my opinion that you were rather rash in that affair, and pushed the matter along, without knowing the facts of the case; and had I known what I do now, the Lanes would still be living in the old house," said Mr. L. "Yes, that is the way; you conducted the case yourself, got the money, crammed it in your pocket, and now want to lay the blame on my shoulders. Now, that is the way with these men, they think the women can stand anything, but I will not submit to it," said Mrs. L. "I am informed, if you please, Mrs. Lambert, that they, the Lanes, never said a word against us; that Mrs. Pettifroid had said it herself, and when she found that it had reached us. she laid it on them, to screen herself. Then, if you please, Mr. Lambert, you had better give them the house back again."   IN TIIE QUEEN CITY.     73 "I never retract," said Mr. L. "Well, then, what are you tantalizing me for? Why don't you go about your business, you cruel taunt, and not be worrying the life out -of me? You are always saying something to hurt my feelings, you old wretch," said Mrs. L. "Mrs. Lambert, if you please----" "Don't say please, to me I "If you will allow the expression, Mrs. Lambert, I understand you wanted- better neighbors than the Lanes, and were determined to get them out of that house at all hazards, if you please, Mrs. Lambert." "Don't say that to me, you old smooth-tongued hypocrite, trying to tease the life out of a Christian woman." "Yes, and if you have anything more to do with that Mrs. Pettifroid I'll let you both take care of each other and see how you get along," said. Mr. Lambert. "Yes, and if you don't leave this room, Iwill," said Mrs. L. It did not take Mr. L, long to snugly ensconce himself in bed under the nice counterpane, while she flirted out of that room and into another, where she passed the night on a lounge; getting up in the morning with a bad headache and' neuralgia, as one would naturally have after a stormy night. This was rather adverse to connubial felicity, and Mr. Lambert thought he could spend his evenings more pleasantly away from home, and acted accordingly. The evening after this, Mr. Wolf, one of those gen-  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7412-00000038"/> 74      MY THREE NEIGHBOB8 tlemen who are permitted to run all night, and wear a star upon their breasts, was prowling about the city. He found a nest of sporting characters seated around a table, dividing their funds as the cards dictated. Mr. Wolf disguised himself, went in and played one game himself, in order to ascertain who they were, but did not succeed, as the young foxes had donned old wigs and the old men, false moustaches, which en- tirely prevented their recognition. However, -Mr. Wolf sallied forth, and soon returned with two assist- ants, who now made an attack upon the illegal sportsmen.. A general scuffle ensued, some escaping in various directions. The result was that each of- ficer arrested a man. Officer Wolf had captured a large, fine-looking -victim by the collar, and with the assistance of a genteel club if needed, was escorting him to the watch-house. As they approached a gas- light he looked his prisoner in the face and recognized him. In his astonishment he exclaimed, "Is this Mr. L!" "Don't call me by name in this public place; here is a purse, take that.' Of course, the officer could not hold two things at one time, and only took the latter to the watch-house, which was much easier to take. To mention the name of the individual would make an opening for another libel case, thus, you will permit silence for the present.  +    *   '   * Many changes are visible in our neighborhood. Charles Winfield is in our circle no more. Mr.   IN THE QUEEN OIT.       76 Lambert. has not been home since that connubial storm. Mrs, Pettifroid had donned entire black for the loss of her husband; and to-day Lizzie Lane had accompanied old Mrs. Burner, the pauper, to her last resting-place. Even this brought gloomy thoughts upon Lizzie's mind, as she would miss the old lady in her usual errands of charity to that part of the city-and now what was to become of the old man Burner I Lizzie and Ma were planning what to do with him, and finally concluded to arrange their attic room and let him live there, and they could give him food from their table without incurring any extra ex- pense. No one knows why they take so much inter- est in the old pauper: but perhaps some good may come out of it, as "bread scattered upon the waters will, return after many days." They had just settled their arrangements about the poor old man as Ella Blair made her appearance.  Lizzie's countenance brightened up to see her friend Ella, whom she had not met since the holidays. They now stole away, by themselves, leaving Mrs. Lane to prepare tea, as it was almost night, while they held confidential chat. "Come, Lizzie, tell me all about city affairs, for I have not been to town since I saw you before, and I want to hear the news." "Ah, Ella, I venture you have seen George Lenore often enough to get the news." "Indeed, Lizzie, I have not since he came to the city, for you have superseded me entirely in his affec- tions.

He is the finest looking gentleman of my acquaint- ance, and if you remain a few days with me, Ella, you may see him; but you must not be too pleasant and'winning, for he always did like you pretty well, and besides, you would be spoiling my affairs, as I never will care for any other gentleman." 'Well done, Lizzie; how candid you are, I should thinJr you and George were in full earnest, or else you would not be so positive in making him the sole ob, ject of your cares; well, I will not interfere, as I have some one to care for, as you term it," said Ella. The conversation here changed, as Lizzie inquired after Mr. Lambert's family. "Ella, what has become of your uncle Lambert? as I have not seen him go in or out the gate for sev- eral days; is he sick or absent from home " "I will tell you all I know about it, Lizzie: you are aware that my aunt, with her troublesome pride, has some very peculiar notions, and they do not cor- respond with his views exactly. Well, it appears from these, and perhaps other causes, that they do not live together as happily as some folks do; hence, the other night, they had some pretty sarcastic words, and Mr. Lambert has not been seen since; now, whether that is the cause of his absence, or whether some foul   W TnE quaE On.

"Her name was Irene Bard," said Lizzie. "Well, what I was going -to say is this: Mrs. Pettifroid is our neighbor, and as she is about to move to the city, since she has lost her husband, I thought I would make her a visit, and take tea, which I did just before I came to the city, and on her table, noticed some familiar looking spoons, marked ' I. B.,' and thought they were the same I had seen at your house, and did not know what it meant." "Can it be possible, Ella t why we turned off that Bridget, because we missed them, supposing she had taken them," said Lizzie. i  Well, I knew you would not part with them, and thought strange, that she should have the same mark that you have," said Ella. "Now, I hardly know how to believe such'a thing but if you are positive about it, Ella, I will take some plan to get them without getting her into any more trouble, as her afflictions are great enough at pres- ent- therel ma is calling us to tea; let us go." Charles Winfield, after waiting a week or two in New York, for a vessel, has now bid farewell to his * '   TS*f  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7412-00000040"/> MY, THRES I NEIGHBORS native soil, and is just starting out on a fine steamer, bound for the Old World. Manhattan Island, with all its attractions, is fast disappearing. New York City, with its immense buildings and tall spires, has dwindled to a point. Charles, taking a last view, is left alone to contemplation, revolving in his mind the first, unpleasant feelings of an introduction to the Atlantic, viewing its surface with sublime feelings, mingled with suspicion, knowing that its calm coun- tenance was not free from frowns, that many a mortal had met a cold embrace in its now peaceful bosom; again,. thinking how unpleasant to travel without a companion; no' associates but strangers; no enter- tainment for a " city gent;" no music but the noisy crew, and the dashing, splashing waters around the frail, bark. Just at this moment Charles received a gentle tap upon the shoulder, and looking up, was astonished to see his city friend, the Hon. Mr. Lam- bert, staring him full in the face. "I How does it happen, Charles, that you are just starting? I thought you left some ten days since," said Mr. L. "I was detained some time in New York looking for a vessel suitable for such a voyage; but I. cannot understand how I should meet you here, at this time, as you did not contemplate the journey when I came away," remarked Charles. "1 Don't ask me any questions, at this time, Charles; but I will tell you at some other time, as, perhaps, I will accompany you through your whole journey, if   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      79 you have no objections. I wish you to feel at ease in my company; although I am much older than your- self, I will join you in your rambles, and can be as young as you are. I am resolved on a regular spree, and lhpe we will have a gay time," said Mr. Lam- bert. "I am happy to have your company, as I should have had a lonesome tour, all by myself," replied Charles. With- this, they went down to their berth, got out a pocket companion, and each took a sup of strong "Iemonade," followed by a dessert of cigars, and that by another julep. They soon became fluent in con- versation, and the old man gave Charles a full his- tory of his family affairs. Charles learned that there were two. causes for the old man's leaving home :one was that he could not get along happily with his wife, and another, to. avoid an anticipated law-suit that he thought his absence would prevent, and the preven- tion of which would be a pecuniary advantage to him, concerning which the reader will know more at another time. Julia and her ma were now queens of the castle, and sole proprietors of the old Lambert mansion. Julia was very uneasy about her father, and was prepared in her own mind to hear the worst news concerning him. Mrs. Lambert, however, seemed perfectly at ease, and did not trouble herself, except when asked the where- abouts of her husband, which she could only answer by saying he was absent on business; yet she knew  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7412-00000041"/> 80      MY, TIRRE NEIGHBOBS this excuse would not always do, and was afraid that public conjecture might reflect upon the family, as his departure was so mysterious. Julia and her ma had already begun to contrive some means wherewith to meet their future necessities and extravagance, as the old man left only a few hundred dollars at home, and that would not last them a great while. A conversation concerning those things, was inter. rupted by a call from a gentleman from New York, who was an acquaintance of'the family, and having heard from some source, that they did not know any. thing of Mr. Lambert, or of his whereabouts, had come, thinking that what little he knew might give them some relief. The gentleman stated, that he saw Mr. Lambert iu New York City, and had a long conversation with him about affairs of the Queen Oity: among other things, Mr. Lambert seemed troubled about a lawsuit; and the last he saw of him, was at the foot of Duane St., where he bade him good-night, as he said he was going to take the ferry-boat for Hoboken. He was afraid afterward that Mr. L. Ilad drowned himself, for the New York papers stated that some man had fallen overboard from the ferry-boat that night, al- though he could not collect information sufficient to decide whether it was his friend Lambert or not, but thought it his duty to tell them the circumstances. Mrs. Lambert remarked, that she was not uneasy, for he was not fool enough to kill himself.   M TH QUEN  rrITY.     81 Julias would have been more iuneasyt ab6ut her father, had it not been for the indifference shown by her mother, which made- her think that she knew something of his absence, and perhaps had an idea where he was. However, Julia had determined to assuage her troubles by receiving company, giving encouragement to the young fellows, and enjoying their society as much as possible, during Charles' absence.- The evening came round, and so did Mrs. Pettifroid, with iwhbm Mrs. Lambert was renewing her intimacy, since each had lost a' husband, and could sympathize with the other, although Mmrs. Lam- bert was not certain whether she was a widow or not. After relating the whole affair to Mrs. P., the latter lady suggested that she could relieve her from her doubts entirely, if she would not mention it to any one. Now Mrs. Pettifroid was a believer in astro- logy, necromancy, spirit-rappings, and all other doubtful sciences of the day; and belonged to the tribe of mediums, who could disclose the fate of Mr. Lam- bert, without leaving a doubt upon any one'smind. She could tell past, present, and future events (no doubt the former), but did not wish it-to become a public matter, as she did not like the name of fortune- teller; but Mrs. Lambert was willing, and they pro- ceeded. A small table was placed in the center of the floor, with a widow-on two of its sides. As they were alone in communion with -tle spirits, they ask questions, and with their four hands placed upon the. table, wait for an answer.

Meeting so much encouragement (they were satis- fled with the performance, so far as it went), they now tried a pack of cards, by, and through which, they could see the old man, at a great distance: he seemed to be in trouble-but last they retire to the kitchen, and make a cup of tea strong enough to bear an egg on its surface; having drank the precious fluid, they now consult the leaves in the bottom of their cups, which reveal to a demonstration, the whole mys- tery. "Yes, I can see him as plain as can be, in the bottom of the cup I Yes, there he is I He is drowned, and that settles the matter!" Mrs. Pettifroid, after a few words of condolence, takes her departure for the night. Mrs. P. now resided in the city with her two daughters, who were lately married. Their husbands were a couple of worthless fellows-not having energy enough to earn a livelihood, hence their wives and mother-in-law were compelled to do sewing and milli- nery to make a living, as this seemed, at that time, the only resort for females: unlike the present day, when they can mount the rostrum, like a Clay or Webster in their eloquence; or like a Kossuth,-can unloose the purse-strings of a generous public, then, retire and live in elegance, like a lady; or, after a few years study, can take their buggy, and visit   IM, THE QUEEN OITY.      88" aflicted families, giving pills and consolation; which, by the way, is no discredit to our American woman, but, per contra, goes to prove that talents have been distributed equally to male and female, and only lie dormant where they are uncultivated, and, therefore, undeveloped.  c,  -  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7412-00000043"/> 84      trMY WKai  SEIOHBOi ' CHAPTER IX. THE CONQUEST-ARRIVAL AT BREMEN-THE OHOLFRA AND ITS VICTIM, ETO. ELLA BLAIR had completed her visit at Lizzie Lane's, and returned home to prepare her wardrobe and worldly matters, as she was about to bestow her hand upon a young merchant, with whom she be- came acquainted at Julia's party. Yes, prepare her worldly affairs: for it seems that dying and getting married are synonymous terms, in our western coun- try ; at least so far as society is concerned, for so soon as the happy pair have passed the day of nuptial ceremonies, there follows an entire exclusion from society, a kind of don't-care-for-anybody-but-my-hus- hand, or would'nt-wish-to-see-any lady-but-my.-wife, and  a general cutting of old acquaintances and friends; in fact, becoming a self-entertaining duett, with fill determination -to increase their pecuniary means, and "lay up something for a rainy day," or prepare for squalls in the sea of matrimony. After Ella had finished her visit and gone home, Lizzie Lane made herself busy for a day or two, in fitting up the attic-room for old Mr. Burner to occupy. She had procured a cozy little bedstead; a small bit of carpeting; an " old arm chair," and such other   IN THE QUBEE Orr.       85 articles as she thought of, for his comfort dauing the rest of his days. Now, that she had him under her charge, it would save her many a long walk during the hot days of summer, as it was now the latter part of June. Lizzie had just finished her own supper and sent a portion up to the atfic,'as Julia came skipping into the house, full of glee, and met her with a kiss, and at the same time slipping a few sovereigns in her hand, darted off home in a trice, lest her mother should miss her, and find out where she had gone. Lizzie knew what it meant, and did not consider her- self an object of charity, nor dependent upon the Lamberts; but remembered Julia's former vows, and knew she was only getting what belonged to her; yet she thanked Julia, in her own mind, and admired her trait of honesty; and truly this commencement of favors toward Lizzie, was noble in Julia, for they were almost at their wit's end to know how to man- age their own affairs, as their means'were at a low tide, and they hardly knew where to get sufficient to keep up appearances, after the present purse was empty. They had a valuable residence, to be sure, but selling that, would be like starving, to their dig- nity. They had the old Lane house, but that did not bring much income, after paying taxes and re- pairing. So they must put their heads together, and conjure up some plan to replenish their purse. As "necessity is the mother of invention," Julia and her ma soon hit upon a plam that would do for a  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7412-00000044"/> 86       MY THREE 3SEEIGHBORS while, and that was to have a few genteel acquaint. ances come aid reside withl them, from whom a liberal compensation would furnish their table and wardrobe for the present. It was a capital hit-" it took " very well. Now, Mrs. Pettifroid was the first to take a comfortable back room, in the third story, where she could do her sewing, and not be annoyed with her two'sons-in-law, as she and they were dis. posed to wrangle. After a few days they made arrangements for Mrs. Ella Blair Kelly and her husband (who were moving to the city) to take a large front room, in the second story. Now, that was very pleasant, to have a neice and nephew in the family, and he, being a merchant, could pay fifteen dollars a week, easily enough, es- pecially as they were just married. And beside, they needed a man about the house, as it was unsafe for females to live alone in large cities: as, in case of robbers breaking into the house, they would be fright- ened out of their wits. So this completed the ar- rangement, which worked like a charm. Soon (with the surplus revenue they already had, the little rent coming in, and the profits of the table) they had laid by a small sinking fund. Elated with success, Miss Julia must enjoy herself, and to keep up appearances, must take a tour north and east, to the fashionable watering-places, both to avoid the heat of the city and benefit her health. All she had to do was to suggest a thing to her ma, and then get ready. Julia was now determined to enjoy-herself, and make   'M THE QUEEN CITY.      87 the best use of her time, during Charles' absence, as after his return, she must terminate her flirtations. She had already prepared herself, and set a day, for going east; her young mercantile acquaintances were posting themselves as to the time of her depart- ure, each- one intending to make it convenient to start about that time, to purchase goods, and have the pleasure of her company. Julia was aware of this, from the repeated questions as to when she was going away, and to make a joke out of it, she made a point of telling each one, and. intimating that she would be pleased With his company; but George Lenore (who visited Julia occasionally) had the pre- ference, and had made a positive engagement to ac- company her. Lizzie knew that George visited Julia quite 'often, but did not know that he was going to accompany her on her eastern tour, or her jealousy would have augmented, for she was already a little jealous, fear. ing that Julia's charms might entice George away, and weaken the claims she had upon him. Yet, what could she do? she did not blame Julia for tak- ing a fancy to such a fine fellow; nor could she cen- sure George, if he was carried away by her winning ways; therefore, she was left entirely to the fates, and would have to abide the result like a philosopher. ' I do wonder if he will come this evening," said Lizzie to herself, as she sat by the parlor window watching the approaching twilight, " or will he go to see Julia 8 Now, if he has more regard for her than 8 !  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7412-00000045"/> for myself, he may go, and I don't care a straw, an neither of them shall ever know how much I leveI the fellow. Ah, here he comes tow; I will notic his conduct particularly this evening," thought Lizzie By this time he had entered the door. Lizzie me: him, cheerfully as usual, and they passed a pleasant evening; but the conversation was of a general char. acter, not confining itself to affairs of personal inter- est. George mentioned nothing about his going to accompany Julia on a tour, but when he left, bade her an affectionate farewell, saying that he would not see her again for a month perhaps, as he was going to New York, iln the  oring, on law business, which would detain him that length of time. The next morning, by dawn of day, a coach con. taining Mr. Loenore called for Jalia, who was all ready for once, and soon they measure the distance to the depot, in order to take the first train. They get comfortably seated, when they move slowly through the eastern subnurbs of the city. Now a half dozen young fellows individually and separately walk by, bidding Miss Julia good morning. Finding her comrn. fortably entertained by Mr. Lenore, and themselves uncomfortably cut out of the pleasure of her company, they come to the conclusion that they have been sold, and take a seat in another car. Some of the beaux get di at the first stopping place and wait for the next train. Now this was a  piece of mischief in Miss Julia, buit such as she delighted in.  They now traveled along pleasantly; making nice   IN THE QUEsN OrTY.      89 remarks about the passing scenery, viewing the man- ners and dress of all kinds of folks that you meet on the cars, and making themselves merry at others' ex- pense.  So the day passes and night brings them to Cleveland. Here is a general rush and tumble to get aboard the steamer, anxiously awaiting to bear them across the lake. In a few minutes they reach the "bark upon the billow." Julia is seated in the eabin, while George spends a full hour, jamming and push- ing at the ticket. office to procure a state-room, Finally he gets one for Julia, but finds number two has to sleep on the floor, as the boats are always crowded at this season of the year. The next thing is the enjoyment of -a fine supper, after which the '.old folks" retire and the young people have their amusements. George and Julia did not join in the glee of the cabin, but took a seat outside to enjoy the cool breeze and see the moon spreading silver leaves upon the lake. Soon, however, they glide into an affectionate exchange of words and opinions perfectly applicable to young people at this tender age, particularly if one admires and the other reciprocates. If an interval occurred between subjects, Julia would occupy it by singing, in a low tone, a few lines from "Love not," or "Home, Sweet Home." Thus the evening was whiled away, but not without leaving impressions, more durable than words written in the sand. But alas, there is an end to this sweet communion for the present; here comes the chambermaid, who is about  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7412-00000046"/> MY THRER NEIGHBORS. to "close for the distribution of the males," and gives notice accordingly. Julia bids George good-night, and he is let, alone to contemplation. , "Ah, she is a gem!  Is there any possibility of my succeeding in a suit for that heiress I It wont do to think of it, for what will poor Lizzie do? I almost wish I had never seen but one of them. I must go down and take a mint julep, perhaps I will feel bet- ter." George went down   to the bar, took his julep, smoked a cigar, and then reclined on a lounge. He could not sleep, or banish from his mind the idea of' pressing a suit for Julia's hand, although he knew there were vows opposed to it on both sides. The next morning they arrive at Buffalo, where they take the cars for Niagara, and in an hour or two are enjoying the pleasant society at the Falls., Perhaps this absence from the Queen City was for-, tunate on their part, for in a few days after their de- parture that dread disease, the cholera, made its appearance, and soon spread itself through every ward of the city, marking out its victims and placing its fatal seal upon their brow; baffling medical skill, and crushing human beings to the earth, as the car of Juggernaut. Citizens, seeing its boldness and tatal- ity, are gathering up their families and fleeing the "  wrath to come." Man, in all his greatness, falls to the earth beneath the tyrant. There is not a time in memory, when dearest friends collect together, and. shudder with fear, as when this plague is at the ,*8   IN THE QoKS cITY.       91 threshold. The city is wrapped in gloom; business seems suspended on every side; man walks forth in his strength, but may return in weakness to his couch, before the setting sun. Among its first victims at this time, was the good lady, Mrs. Winfield, who i now no more. The chil- dren weep for a mother, the husband-a wife; the once happy home now seems a strange dwelling place, for nothing constitutes a home when the mother is taken away. The father who is absent so much on business, receives- a share of affection from the chil- dren, but not equal to that of the mother, whose kind words and gentle caresses greet them all day long; the loss of which makes a deeper and more lasting impression upon the family than the loss of a father. Charles could not share their affliction  at this time, for he was beyond the reach of such sad news. It had been two months since he left home; lie enjoyed a fine voyage with his elder companion. At this time they had passed through the English Channel in safety, and had completed their voyage, by their arrival- at Bremen. They were in Deutschland, enjoying new scenery, queer costumes, and a strange lingo; all was nix for-stays, except native wine and lager-beer, which they understood pretty well. However, they soon discovered Englishmen  enough, to have a few asso- ciates, who could point out objects of interest and admiration, in New and Old Bremen, which were divided by the Weser River. During their stay in this place, they- viewed with interest, some of the  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7412-00000047"/> 92      MY TBhBE NEtGHBOBS noted works of architecture, one of which, was St. Peter's Cathedral. They also visited the great mu- seum, and the' immense libraries; in the latter of which they did not consume much time in reading.  Their visit here was of short duration. They soon find themselves in Dusseldorf, on the Rhine, which is a great school for artists. - Here they could enjoy the fine scenery, which had furnished subjects for many an easel. After taking a survey of the natural scenery, combined with ancient monuments of art, as may be seen on every side in these old countries, where old castles and kingly palaces have crumbled to the dust, save a few pillars here, and there, which remain a little longer in their lonely dignity, because time has not ordered a dissolution, they take a second view of the same, by visiting the art-galleries, where the old and new masters had placed upon canvas, viventes impresmones. Dusseldorf is at present an unrivaled school for artists, and receives students from all parts of the world. They here met one or two old acquaintances from the Queen City, who were pursuing the study of the fine arts, and whose fine productions still orna- ment the walls of the Art Union Gallery.. Anxious, however, to iee the country from north to south, they soon depart from Dusseldort, by taking a boat and traveling up the beautiful Rhine, viewing the classic scenery on either side, until they reach Cologne, which, place is familiar to our city belles and beaux, from its sweet scented extracts. Of course Charles   IN TE  QUEEN Crir.      98 laid in a supply of the same, and a sufficient quantity for all the handkerchiefs flourished at a Queen City opera., After a few days in Cologne (during which time they were highly fed, and drank copiously of Rhenum. vinumn), they take the cars, bound for Aix-la Ohapelle, which is noted as the birth and burial place of Charle- mange, and for its ancient relics, dating as far back as the erunciion ; such as pieces of the cross, and clothes of the Saviour; which are owned and treasured by Roman Catholics. Here we leave them seeking -every enjoyment the country afforded. *  *  *    #    , But, to return to the Queen City, we find Mr, Win- field quite at a loss to get along with his broken up family: there were the two younger children, who needed some one to take charge of them, and Kate, the eldest daughter, could not undertake such a task; therefore Mr. Winfield was contemplating engaging a governess, if he could find one of a suitable disposition. He inquired of Mrs. Lambert, if she could refer himn to any one, whom she thought capable of filling that place, and that would be kind to the children. After a few moments consideration, she suggested Mrs. Pettifroid; whom she considered would be the very person to supply that place. The recommendation was sufficient. Mrs. Petti- froid was engaged, and made mistress plenipotentiary of the Winfield family, by consent of all parties. The duty that now devolved upon her, was to look after  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7412-00000048"/> 4.      MY THREE NEIGHBORS the affairs of the house,: from the culinary department to the. chamber; and to make purchases of marketables and merchandise for the family, as necessity required. She must also win the good graces of Kate, which was soon acecomplished, and also of the two yung children, which she did by kind treatment. - Mr. Winfield's health seemed impaired by his afflic. tions, and his physician required him to- take a journey, as perhaps a temporary absence from the place of his late afflictions might expel the gloom from his mind, and recruit his care-worn frame. He therefore arranged his business, so that it would per- mit his absence, and took his departure for the north, leaving funds at, home sufficient to provide' for them during his absence. Mrs. Pettifroid was now sole proprietor of family and funds, and with some economy and financiering, she could spare some food and funds. for her two daughters, who could not earn enough to live upon;  thereby doing an act of charity, and robbing no one, as it would merely be the result of her own economy, as it was hardly flair play for one family to be over- fed, and another starve. Such was her philosophy and logic. Thus, frequently, a double supply was purchased on market-day, and dispensed with accord- ing to her above-mentioned principles. Sometimes her daughters lacked a sufficient amount of money to- pay their rent, which she advanced to them, and replaced by economy. But it is very naughty to be prying into other people' affairs, or finding f4ult, when folks   1W TUE QUNEN CITY.       9i are trying to keep up appearances by private finan- ciering, orpettyfrauding. . The Queen City, with all its attractions and enter- prize, wealth and hospitality, presents as great a variety of living specimens, as would suffice for a human museum, comedy, or sketch-book. Here and there is a wealthy family, living at ease, respected in society, and digtus Aonore, from all mankind; ,upon the other hand, are specimens of humanity poor and proud, always donning a costume of latest pattern, as la mode de Parisienne, at the expense of lifers com- forts; too proud to work in the prime of life, and com- pelled to ask assistance in their old age. Another specimen was old Mrs. Driftwood, whose family sup- ported themselves at the expense of their neighbors, but without their consent; in other words, they borrowed clothes, wood, and food, without leave, and forget to return them; who were finally fed and clothed at the expense of the State. Again, there was old man Chester, who lived at his ease from large donations by a generous public; that is, he kept a kind of bank, or pecuniary post-office, where the good people sent their funds to strangers, and it "ne'er was heard of more." The approach of autumn, restored the Queen City to its usual health and energy.

Tile citizens whbo had left the Queen City during the summer, were returning home; among whom were George and Julia. They had enjoyed a fine tour; having gone the same round that Charles Winfield and Julia did, the year previous; but George had no ill luck, nor got left behind at Wheeling some four weeks, without a change of linen, as did Charles, who was Julia's first suitor; but they had met with abun. dant pleasure and amusement, had made a trip down the beautiful Hudson, visited Saratoga, promenaded in Castle Garden, wrote their names on the Washing- ton Monument, in Baltimore, were baptized at Cape May, and came home rejoicing. 'Ah, Julia, you bave had so many calls during your absence; you will find all the cards, and some letters, in your card-basket on the etagier," said Julia's ma, after they had a long chat about the trip. Julia hastens down to the drawing-room, takes a seat, with the card-basket in her lap, to see how many calls she owed, and who had written to her. ^Ah, here is a strange looking letter, who can this be from? I will see.'*' She finds it is a letter 'from Charles Winfield, and reads: BREMEN, July, 18. MY DEAREST JULIA: The profound sentimentality of my feelings (when contemplating an epistolary communion between two congenial spirits as ours) is almost inexpress- O  -   * 9      S   IN THS QUEVN CITY.        97 ible. I can hardly refrain from giving full utterance to my sentiments, at this time. If too flagrant with terms of my devotion, you must attribute the same to a source founded deep in the heart of one who admires you; and a heart sending forth germs of affection, kept alive by the dews of admiration. It seems as if I cannot await the time and distance that intervenes between us at this time. O that IF could mount the clouds, and ride on the wings of the winds that I might see thy smiling face ere the setting sun.      , I have enjoyed my travels, so far, very much; but since I sit down to write to you, I have taken the horrors most* wofully-a gloomy sadness fills my mind, and a meager hope is the food of my spiritual existence. That I may again see thy cheerful face, and hear thy sweet voice in accents of euphony still familiar to my memory, is my prayer. Please write to me at Florence, in Italy. Remember thy vows to--     Yours, affectionately,     , CHARLES WINFIELD. Now I am in a dilemma, thought Julia, after pe- rusing this affectionate epistle; the poor fellow: he loves me still; but I don't care a straw about him, and I hardly know whether to answer this letter or not; nor in what manner, if I should. If I write him an affectionate letter, it will giveehim encouragement, that, perhaps, would not result in his favor. If I write him a cool letter, he will despair of future hap- piness, and take himself to dissipation, as he vowed I was his only choice, and I know his sanguine tem-  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7412-00000050"/> 98      MY THBEE NEIGHBORS perament will - not admit of disappointment, without serious results; yet. I am not decided as to what course to pursue; I will go and ask. ma; perhaps she can give me some advice. Julia is now in her ma's presence: after reading the letter to her ma, she awaits her advice. "My daughter, what does he mean by ' vows,' in the latter part of his letter--have you made any en- gagement with him " "I did 'make a sort of engagement with him; but I am not going to seclude myself from society on his account; and if I see any one that I like better, I will not wait for his return," said Julia. "I think, my daughter, that you are too young to marry; but when you do think of such 'a thing, I must know about it, for I want you to marry some wealthy, prominent man; and if I am able, I would, like to have you visit Europe, and hope you may be fortunate enough to marry a count or a prince before your return," said Mrs. Lambert. "O dear, what high notions you have; you must think I could get any person." "Yes, daughter, and if folks do not carry a high head, they will never accomplish anything; but as to that letter you had better write him a rather indiffer- ent answer for the present; after his return you can treat him rather coolly and by that means break off his visits.'" Julia took the advice, wrote Charles an epistle con. taining more news than sentiment. After slipping it   IN THB QuEIN OlrY.       99 in the post-office she made a call on her friend Lizzie Lane, relating the minutiae of her travels. Lizzie was much interested, so far as a description of the beautiful scenery and variety of fashions was con- cerned, but it was news to her that George had been her gallant during the tour; yet she did not intimate such a thing to Julia as being a little jealous; nor did she blame Julia, or have the least ill feeling toward her, although they were now rivals; yet she must censure George, in her own mind, for trifling with her feelings and for his fickleness. Julia now places in Lizzie's hand, a purse, containing the savings during her journey, caused by George's lib. erality in defraying expenses that Julia expected to meet with her own funds. Having done this favor, she leaves Lizzie alone once more and hastens home.                   J Tea was set aside at Lane's, and Lizzie was help. ing her ma by arranging things -for the night, as George Lenore announced his presence by a gentle tap on the door, which was standing open. Lizzie was glad to'see George, for he had been absent so long and she almost worshiped the fellow, although George was halting between two opinions; yet he was equally pleased to see Lizzie. They happily conversed upon spontaneous subjects during the evening. Finally, George 'gave a programme, ver- batim, of his pleasure-trip with Julia, at the same time intimating that her company was more acci-  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7412-00000051"/> 100 )     MY THREE IIGHBORS dental than intentional, as if she happened to be going east at the same time.  However, Lizzie knew; yet she did not blame George for making some excuse. George had mentioned this to see if Lizzie was jealous, but she assumed such an air of perfect indifference, that he could discover nothing like jealousy., His object was to find out by observ- ation, whether there would be any blighted pros- pects or disappointed hopes if he should break the engagement with Lizzie. George loved Lizzie, yet he had permitted himself to be blinded by the pur- suit of wealth and attracted by fine appearances; he thought he ' had better marry wealth, and let love and happiness come afterward, than to marry one whom he loved, and struggle through the world to make a livelihood, fearing the lat- ter iwould quench the last spark of happiness; that living in an humble cot, would chill the young germs of affection ere they had time to bloom. Erring youth, look around among the wealthy families of our city; see the old man, gouty, rheu- matic and bloated with high seasoned food and foreign wine; see the wife and daughter reclining on their velvet couch, with pallid face and sunken cheeks lined with foreign ivory.

LAMBERT and Charles, in the meantime, had left Aix-la-Chapelle and returned to the Rhine. A short tour up the river brought them to Wiesbaden, which is a beautiful city, and as great a resort for the native aristocrats as our Niagara or Cape May. It is noted for its hot springs, containing the medicinal virture of curing all diseases arising fromn high living; ergo, the epicure and gourmand find the disease and cure in the same place. Charles and his companion find Wiesbaden a fine place to draw on their purse; but being rather for- tunate in replenishing the same at the roulette and card-table, they conclude to remain and enjoy their high living .for a time. Their success at gaming might be attributed to their being strangers to each other in the gaming room, yet playing as partners; thereby helping each other to win,- and divide the spoils at some other time. When tired of this place, they take the cars and in an hour or two find themselves looking about Frank- fort, which is an old town under republican govern- ment, having two presidents and a hundred congress- men to support, which they thought was sufficient.   IN THE QUEEN CITY.      103 They continued up the  Rhine to Baden-Baden, which being a place of some note, they took pains to loolk around. After getting a glimpse of the Grand Duke, they were shown the old prison, and entertained with some of the ancient modes of tor- ture and punishment, but were somewhat relieved when informed that they were not used at the present day.  " A few evenings after this, our two Americans were seated by a roulette table, in an obscure back room of a strange house, in company with half a dozen gentle- men with mustachios: It was quite late, and Mr. L. had been more successful than any one this evening; and, in fact, had almost stripped his companions in the game: he now spoke of its being late, took another glass of wine, and was about .taking his leave, when they objected; having no notion of letting him depart with all their funds. They were determined to play as long as they had a guilder left, hoping their luck might change, and they could win back some of their money. Finally, Mr. L. and Charles arose to depart, which caused angry feelings-stimulated by wine, they were easily aroused. Mr. L. approached the door, when a general fuss began. Mr. L. was finally knocked down, the lamp was broken to pieces, leaving them in total darkness; Charles fired a revolver in the air, which caused the crowd to disperse. Mr. Lambert was not so much injured, but that he and Charles could make short the distance to the Hotel Del Eu-  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7412-00000053"/> 104      MY THaRER NEIGHBORS rope, and as soon as possible retire to their private room. "(My goodness, Charles, that was an awfuFescape; they had determined to rob us, but each one left it for the other to do, and they all fled in different diree. ton's. I suppose they intend to 'meet and divide the spoil. Well, it is no joke; I believe you saved my life, and if ever I have an opportunity, I will reward you for it; but let us see what we have made this evening;" so Mr. L. empties his pockets on a small table, and count out half to Charles, who had not made anything. In order to drown their excitement, and being bent on a spree, they consult a pocket companion as: to its contents, and are soon able to consult themselves on the same subject. The wee drop of Bourbon did not mix very well with wine, having a tendency to make them rather eloquent; while the old man tries to con. vince his audience that Ben. Franklin discovered America. Charles is trying to retire by stretching himself out upon his trunk, which being one of those round tops, finally let him down behind it; there he lay betwixt the trunk and the wall, with his feet stick- ing out past one end and his head visible at the other. While the old man had taken a lamp, and was navi. gating the room in search of Charles, calling- him at every step, Charles, half asleep, was answering in a smothesed tone, The old man concluding that he was in the room some place, gave up the chase. Next the old gent   IN TEI QUBEN COITr      105 concludes to wash himself and retire, gathers up the wash-bowl, which is full of soiled water, raises the window, sets the bowl upon the sill, and tips it in, in- stead of out, which causes the discovery of Charles, who lies beneath. This sudden shower seemed to arouse Charles enough, to find the proper place to retire; and soon they are in the arms of Morpheus. The next morning they arose pretty late, with a vile headache; but feeling somewhat better after they had accomplished breakfast, concluded to take a little ride about the city and country, hoping that the fresh air and scenery might revive their spirits, as the re-action from the previous stimulants had left them as much below par, as they had been elevated the night previous. They had chartered a small diligence, and were now driving out of the city; being entertained with new landscapes, as they rode along, and entertaining them- selves, by conversing on various subjects. Among other things, Mr. L. spoke of his daughter Julia; and when he found that Charles had visited her quite often, before his leaving home, he felt quite interested, and free to converse about her. J "Ah, Charles, I must tell you a joke that Julia and I had a hearty laugh about: When she and I were taking an eastern tour, she became acquainted with a young fellow, who proposed to. accompany her home; this gent was left behind at Wheeling." "Is it possible?" said Charles, looking the old gent in the face; to see if he could discover anything. "Well," continued the old man, "this fellow was  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7412-00000054"/> 106      MY THREE NEtGHBORS robbed at Wheeling -and had no means to get home with-writes a letter home for money, and, by mistake, directs the letter to my daughter." "Is that a fact I " said Charles. "Yes; and signs the letter ' Charles Winfield,"' said Mr. L., bursting into a loud laugh at Charles' expense. "That is a pretty good joke; we had better stop at that house on the hill, and take something, on the strength of that, as it is my turn to treat." After halting, and taking something for the inner man, they turned about to return home. They were cozily seated in their carriage, when Charles proposed, that if he would never mention that joke again, he would make him a valuable present, before they left the car- riage. The old man agreed; when Charles handed him a gold locket, containing the ambrotype of Julia Lambert. Mr. L. was pleased, and astonished beyond measure; he looked upon the little portrait with most intense pleasure-finally made a duplicate offer to Charles. "Now, Charles, if you will let me keep this little treasure, I will never mention that joke again; and I will also make you a present of the original, herself." "Agreed I " said Charles; when they shook hands, and bound the bargain. Charlds thought his happiness "complete, from what he had accomplished at this time; for Julia was his idol, and he now had the consent of daughter and father,   IN THE QUiB -cYIT .     107 They returned safely to Baden-Baden, where we leave them for the present. Autumn had now thrown its hazy mantle over the Queen City; a misty dimness, covered hill and dale, permitting the-sun's rays to fall tenderly upon the fair earth; the cool breezes of each night, wafted sweet repose to the wearied frame of mortals; and each day, with its bracing atmosphere, added new impulse to man, tired \of the summer's heat; the swallow had sung a farewell note, and taken its departure for a southern clime; the song of the melon-boy, through the streets, was now exchanged for the meiodious notes of the charcoal vender, in every alley and avenue. A. J. Winfield had just returned from his recruiting journey, and was much restored in mind and body; this evening met his family around the cheerful fireside, to relate his adventures, and hear what had transpired during his absence. He was pleased to hear that the children had been treated kindly, and that they loved their new mistress; all of which, he learned from the children. It was now time to retire, as Mrs. Petti- froid came into the room. Kate took her two youbger sisters and retired, leaving the old people to converse about domestic affairs. "I suppose, Mr. Winfield, that you are somewhat fatigued, after your ride in the cars; is there anything that I can do for you? Will you have a cup of tea and a sandwich, before you retire!" "O, no! I do not feel hungry, I only need rest; but  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7412-00000055"/> 10    .,  I MY THjaB ttBB OS 8 how did you get along during my absemn e t Did you have any trouble with my two little girlst" i  L"None at all; they seemed to love me so much, that it was a pleasure to take care- of the darling creatures." "Did your funds hold out during my absenee, suffi- cient to supply your familyinecessities " said Mr. W. "By economical management, I succeeded in get. ting everything we needed; but yesterday I borrowed five dollars from my daughter, whom I met in market; and in the morning I will need the amount to return to her, and as much more, to replenish our sideboard a little." ' "You have done very well; as I stayed longer than I intended," said Mr. W., at the same time handing her the specified amount, 4' and you must not be back- ward in asking me for funds whenever needed." Here the conversation ended; Mrs. Pettifroid went about her night's work, and he retired. On the next morning, after breakfast had been set aside, and the mistress had gone to market, Mr. W. was conversing with Kate, to ascertain the details of affairs during his absence; finding that Eate's opinion was favorable, he felt free to remark that they had been fortunate in getting such a good housekeeper. After suggesting to Kate the propriety of keeping on pleasant terms, and treating her with respect, as was now the ease, he went to see about his business. 4 "Good-morning, daughters, how have you been since I saw you which is nearly a week?" said Mrs,   m  A qUiSjBf oArr.     109 ' Petifroid, as -she met her two great, lasy, grown-up daughters in the market "Why, mother, we have been well enough; but we have been waing -here on the corner a fall half hour. Why did you not come sooner  you know we have not had our breakfast, and nothing' to buy it with." "Hush, don't talk so loud. You know Mr. Win- field came home tired last night, and slept late this morning, and I could not leave until breakfast was over." "And another thing, mother, our rent was due on last Saturday; and, the landlord says, if we do not pay to-day, he-will turn us out of the house." "Here daughter, is eight dollars, that will pay your rent; come, let us go on through the market, and not be-standing here; but where are those lazy husbands of yours this morning!" "We left them both asleep; and they will not get up until we return and get them some breakfast." "What is the price of these steaks, Mr. Butcher V" "Fifteen cents apiece, ma'am." "Well, I'll take three of them," said Mrs. P., as she picked them up. They were as large as a cradle blanket, and tough as sole-leather.

"Yes, I see," said Kate, "you have eggs, turnips, and potatoes; and, 01 what a nice steak." "This is a fine steak, but it cost forty-five cents; which is pretty high, I think." Rate made no reply, for she cared nothing-about these matters, but went about some needle-work; while the mistress went to preparing for dinner: which consisted in laying out the beef-steak on a board, and giving it the heavy end of a flat-iron for three quarters of an hour, until it assumed the consistency of a jelly, and then frying it an equal length of time; which, with the vegetables, was served up for dinner; being a kind of pot-luck repast in a private family.  ,$s   * .                    .   mN THE QUEEN OIT.      1" CHAPTER XI. THE SMALL TEA PARTY --PROPOSALS TO THE WIDOW- THE DREAM. MRs. LAMBERT was now a widow. Yes, and it was given up by every one that her husband had committed suicide, and she had now taken the second degree in her afflictions, which was to put on half- mourning and commence receiving company; or, in fact, was setting her cap for a husband already. At least that was what the world said; but, for once, the worldly talkers were a little behind, for she had been receiving attentions for some time, and this evening has her two beaux and some others invited to take tea with her in her own mansion. The day was passed in preparation for their even- ing party. The time arrived and brought the ex- pected company who were invited to attend at six o'clock, but arrived about nine. Among the distin- guished guests were Mr. Blatters, the Englishman, and Mr. O'Boozle, from swate Ireland. The repast was soon ready, consisting of tea, deviled oysters and fricasseed chicken. The tea-bell brought them around the board in fine spirits.

Biddy hastened to the side-table, took some of each kind, mixed them together and then divided them on, separate dishes. "And what part of the chicken do you wish, Mr. O'Boole " t"And it is meself that will take the head, and if small, bring me two." "We did not cook the head." "Then bring me one of the spare-ribs," said Mr. O'Boozle, who was not used to- the chicken tribe or their anatomy.

They don't care what folks say about them, or whether they have calls, or go calling* In fact, nothing seems to trouble them; they don't seem to care one day what will happen the next." '"How you do talk; I suppose you would like to live in some attic like old Joel Burner across the street." "No, mother, but I would like to live just as the Lanes do, and not be tormented to death with com- pany; yet they are respected in society." "Daughter I will not have you talk so; you are really wicked; you must go and read your Bible, for that will teach you dignity and elegance: for there you will read of purple robes and fine linen, and Sol- omon's splendid temple; you will also find that Paul, says, 'let everything be done decently and in order;'" here the old lady threw back her head with an air of  dignity. , This burst of eloquence caused, Julia to yield, and the argument was postponed. ,    &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7412-00000058"/> "4      MY 'I'UCHE NEIGHBOBS "Ma, why did you not invite cousin Ella Kelly down to tea this evening?"

Julia and her ma were now sitting by a Novem- ber fire, in the drawing-room, financiering and plan- ning to meet their future expenses, such as holiday entertainments, and paying taxes, etc. They now thought of selling the old Lane house: 'twas done as quick as said, for Julia put on her hat, and was soon in a real-estate office, on Third street. The price and description of the property was left with the agent, who said he would soon find a customer, Julia, after making a few calls, returned home re. joicing in the prospects of selling the old house. "' Come, daughter, tell me, what are the prospects of a sale " "I found an agent who says he, has ready pur- chasers for city property, and will sell it this week for three thousand dollars, and that will keep us com- fortable for a year or two. There I ma, I came near forgetting to tell you that I called on Miss Pinebud, as I was coming home, and don't you think she was en dishabille rubbing the furniture and scour- ing the mantlepiece, and had no fire in the parlor?

"Be careful, daughter, we have no fire in the parlor this afternoon." ' Yes, but I told Bridget if any one called, to tell them that we are not at home." Tea had been set aside; mother and daughter were taking a conversational feast in the saloon par. lor. Julia, who was entertained by three, beaux, was as far from her ma as the length of the parlor would permit. Julia was enjoying a trio of young gents, who must have consulted a lexicon, previous to their call, as they were launching out words large enough to choke a Quaker; while' Mrs. Lambert, who ap- peared as youthful as her daughter, was being enter- tained by a pair of suitors, both - striving a, conquest of the widow's affections. One of her beaux .was a Mr. Goldleaf, a small dried up specimen of humanity, rather on the old bachelor's list; yet, making amends for his appearance by being quite wealthy; or, as they call-it in Kentucky, had a " good moral charac. ter."  The rival beau was a young man, of fine ap- pearance, very prepossessing in his manners; could not boast of wealth, but was from one of the " first families in Virginia." He was only about twenty- two years of age; while Mr. Goldleaf had passed thirty nine summers. Mrs. L. was in a  dilemma, halting between two opinions. Had she been so wealthy as they supposed, she would have chosen the young man at sight; for widows always choose a   young man as a second-mate: but here was wealth against appearance, and she could not decide as yet,  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7412-00000059"/> "16 "     TSBBraa t wBE8 for fear 'of regretting it afterward, therefore was try- ing to encourage both, until she could cometo:some conolusion . However, the evening was passed in general con- versation until ten, when Messrs. Goldleaf and Co. took their departure. Mrs. L. retired fully resolved to -come to some. decision, before they should call agai, for fear of receiving a proposal and not being able to answer. Julia's beaux had come and gone during the evening, excepting George Lenore, who remained until about media nocte, on account of not having a good opportunity to chat when there were so many fellows to assist. Julia had no difficulty in making choice, as George was decidedly the fa- vorite. The next morning at the breakfast table, Mrs. Lambert just remembered the dream she had that night. It came to her mind clear as crystal; it must mean something. "Daughter, I had a strange dream last night." "' There it-is again; another dream." "'Yes, and I must tell you this one, for I know it means something." "Don't bother me about your dreams; they are always a mess of nonsense." "I dreamed about two dogs-" "Oj mother, do hush.

"Go on." "Well, I went back to my cupboard and took some pieces of food and returned to the front door." "Proceed'" "I threw the crumbs down at my feet, and one of the dogs came 'up and ate them,' but the other was frightened and ran off." "iWhat kind of dogs were they?" "O yes, I forgot to tell you. One of them was a large Newfoundland, the other was one of these little rat-telTiers, and had a nice gold band' about his neck."

"I am much obliged to you, Mrs. Pettifroid, you have relieved my mind of a great deal of trouble, I will do you a favor some time, for your kindness. I feel much relieved," said Mrs. Lambert, as she de- parted. One evening, the following week, Mr. Goldleaf called at the Lambert mansion and found Mrs. L. alone, for once. Meeting with some encouragement, he conducted the conversation with a little familiar- ity; conversing about the difficulties of widows, such as providing for a family, and settling bills, paying taxes, collecting rents, etc. "Yes, it is a great deal of trouble for me to attend to out-door business; and if I should hire some one to do it they would cheat me, perhaps, and I should not know it, for I know so little about business. But I will have some one to do these things, for I cannot bother about them." Here was an opportunity for Mr. Goldleaf; he made use of it. "Mrs. Lambert, if it be not adverse to your re- fined judgment, or does not conflict with your future intentions; if it be not a reflection upon the high    IN TR QUCES Crry.,      119 standing of your family, nor repugnant to yonr sen- timents, I would offer my unworthy self as a protector for you and yours."

They remain a few days at Genoa, after which they take a boat across the gulf to Leghorn; taking a bird's- eye view of the latter, they push for Florence, the place of their destination, and their headquarters for the winter; as they had decided to make this place the center of a circle, from which they would radiate, to enjoy Italian scenery.

"The cholera has raged in this city since you left, and your mother was one of the first victims. Could I console you, I would do it; but one consolation you have is, that she was a Christian, and is now enjoying per- feet happiness.

However, with your father, it is a loss that can never be repaired: he will never banish her image -from his heart sufficient to have another in her place.

But you are not alone in your afflictions i as, about the time of your departure, occurred the mysterious disappear- ance of my father. This is a deep grief, mingled with sus- pense, as we know not whether he is dead or alive, but have little hope of the latter. Your friends, George Lehore and Lizzie Lane, seem as cheerful and happy as ever; although I do not think that George's attachment to Lizziie is as firm as formerly: per- haps because she has become somewhat reduced.

The next morning, Mr. L. inquired of Charles the cause of his unusual docility, which Charles answered by giving him the letter. The old gent soon acquainted himself with the contents-he deeply sympathized with Charles; yet was pleased to see his daughter's autograph at the bottom of the epistle. "Charles, how does it happen that Julia has written to you? Come now, I wish to know all about it," "That is rather a delicate subject for me to converse about," said Charles. "Pshaw, you can put your modesty in your eye, but that is not to the point. Did my daughter encourage your visits, and do you care anything for her " "That is all true, which you say." "But I did not say anything: I ask you those questions." "O-ah-yes-I understand." "Well, go on." "I remember making propositions to a young lady by that name; I suppose it was your Julia," said Charles, in a taunting manner. "Did she consent " 1"She did." "If that is true, give me your hand;" which was accordingly done, and they went down to the saloon, and took a glass of wine, and then a cigar apiece.   IN THE QUEEN IT      128 "Now, Father Lambert, I want you to relate the cause of your sudden departure from the Queen City," said Charles, mischievously. "Well, sonny, I can do that in a few words, Mrs. Lambert and I never enjoyed that peaceful, connubial state, that some people are permitted to enjoy, and a few evenings before 1 came away, she gave me such a ' candle lecture,' that I determined to let her care for herself for awhile, and see if they would miss me; I also had another reason, which was a lawsuit, that I wanted to avoid, and which would 'not be undertaken if I were absent; and my absence of two or three years would nullify it altogether." "Do you think Julia is a chip of the old block 25" "Come, sonny, let us take a walk, and enjoy a little of the pure Italian air, and ambulate about Florence." They here met a couple of old acquaintances, from the Queen City, a-Mr. Kellogg, a well known knighit of the easel, and Mr. Powers, renowned master of the Greek Slave, who tendered their services in showing our tourists about Florence, and particularly among thefine arts.

During the last two months, Julia had been re. ceiving visits from a Dr. H., who managed a visit alternately with George Lenore. The doctor had met with the utmost success, so far as welcome smiles and loving looks were concerned, and thought himself the chosen one, if he only had the courage to propose. Mischievous Julia deserves a reprimand for playing smash with tender hearts; yet it was a game she fondly loved. In former days she bad many a moral lecture and kind advice, with regard to conquests and coquetry; yet she heeded not; nor did she remember the words of Lissie, that they " would come home some day." Julia had actually given the greatest possible en. couragement to Dr. H., and the result is, to-day she receives a little billet doux containing important pro- positions, stipulating for the future, and that he would call on a certain evening for a verbal answer. Here Julia was making inroads upon Kate Win- field's private affairs, for the doctor had been visiting Kate for more than a year. Although Kate was- only admired by the doctor, he, had visited her regularly for, that length of time, and could give himself no better reason than that he had commenced and never knew any good reason to break off his visits, as Kate was good company, at least. Upon the other   Im THE. QUAlN CITY.     129 hand, he had won KRate's- entire affection, for heowas her first beau, and she, in her innocent confidence, had supposed his visits a mark of love toward her, and himself worthy of being loved. At this time, the doctor was entirely smitten with Julia, and was awaiting his doom with the. utmost suspense. The appointed evening came, and the doctor was fortunate in finding Julia at home and alone. So far as Julia cared, she would as leave been absent, were she: not determined to have some fun: at his expense. Dr. H. was a man of good common-sense, and a mind well balanced; but like many other young fellows, seemed perfectly blind, when required to read the actions of a female; thus permitting himself to be carried to an extreme, that would only result in his own mortification. - Julia was in high glee, this - evening, conversing at random, and particularly avoiding any words that might lead to the expected subject. The evening was pretty well advanced, and the doctor determined to approach the desired subject. "Julia, did you get a -note. from me, this week V" he inquired. "Yes, I believe I did-- O I I forgot to ask you, I doctor, if you had heard the last new song " "I believe not," replied the doctor, in a sage tone. Julia seated herself at the piano and sung the "Mistletoe-Bough."  "'That is is very pretty, but you did not say any- thing about that note I sent you."  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7412-00000066"/> 130      MY TRUR NEIGHBORS "Keep still, Dr. H., I will -sing you one morem" said Julia, previous to the song, "O I should like to marry," etc.  "Very fine," said the doctor; "are those your sen- timents, Julia I " "No, not by three years, at least." "Let us lay all jesting aside, and then tell me if you have no regard for the proposals contained in that epistle " To tell you the truth, doctor, your letter contained such a mess of hyperboles and hypotheses, that I could not tell what you meant." "Well, then, I can tell you now; my visits here for this length of time, have been evidence of my attach- ment for you, and your encouragement has led me to suppose that I was the accepted suitor for your hand, and all that was necessary, was for me to propose and get a minister to consummate thb matter,", "Well done, Doctor H., I do believe you are in earnest; why I never thought of such a thing. I have no idea of getting married for three or four years; and; if I did, I do not think our dispositions would suit each other at all. I had no idea of---." :'Well, that will do for you; don't say another word to me, Julia;" and the doctor took his departure very abruptly. He-was one of those sanguine temperaments, which was now aroused to the highest point; wounded pride, disappointment, and revenge now lurked in every vein; every moment increased a hatred, caused by unreci-   IN THE QUS acrn.       13 1 procated love. He sought dissipation for relief, which only crazed his troubled mind, and more inflamed his spirit of revenge. Day after day went by, but yet his desperation increased. Night after night, he watched the house, and yet accomplished nothing, but to aggra- vate his soul. He often heard her merry laugh and happy words; and that increased his jealous hatred yet the more. "She has destroyed my future happiness-my life, by her deceitful lips, and can I live to see her fair hand bestowed upon another I cannot; I will seek revenge most foul, and thus complete my misery." It was a dark, rainy night; few people could be seen upon the street. Dr. H., groped his way through a dark alley to the rear of the Lambert mansion; he entered the back gate, and left it open, while he moved forward to a place where he could se? into the kitchen, as the door stood ajar. A few burning em- bers in the dining-room, starting into a bright blaze, assisted his vision faintly to that department. He stationed himself in a place where he could look into the kitchen and see if any one approached. There he stood, half-crazed by his augmented ills, and raving mad with his vile imaginations, with a deadly weapon in his hand. "There comes a form; I know that shawl and silken robe: I shall stain it now."  A report fol. lowed-she fell. He threw the revolver into the kitchen, and made his escape,     *  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7412-00000067"/> 132     rMY THRE NEIGHBORS Julia and George, who were conversing in the par- lor, now hastened back to whence the sound pro- ceeded;-but poor Bridget was no more-she had killed herself-there lay the pistol.

The coroner and priest were sent for, and the body disposed of. The next morning found Dr. H. on the cars, bound for the lakes. The deed was done; remorse of con- science now completed his misery. A thousand evil spirits haunted him all day long, and yet he journeyed on in haste, "as the wicked flee when no man pursueth." He passed a restless night at Cleveland; in the morning picked up a Cincinnati paper, to see what was said; when his eyes caught the following: "SUICIDE-On last evening, one of the domestics at the residence of Mrs. Lambert, committed suicide. She had acted strangely for several days previous; and in a crazy spell, had put on the, clothes of the young lady of the house, and then committed the deed." "Pshaw-suicide; well if that is the way it has turned out, I will return to the city; for I don't care anything about it-what business 'had she to steal Julia's wardrobe. I could dissect a half dozen such girls for stealing; but I am satisfied now-   IN THE QUEEN CITY.     133 I am glad it is no worse.

The very atmosphere seems blue; silver beads glisten on every tree along the pave; the icy-plated bowlders repel the oblique rays of the morning sun; the mercury even crouched within the tube, rather than face the northern blast; yet the in- dustrious citizen supped his coffee, and ventured forth to his daily occupation. "'I do not think you should venture out this cold morning; you had better let Biddy go to market, and you stay at home, andtake care of yourself," said Mr. Winfield to Mrs. Pettifroid, as they were finishing breakfast. "Why, what does this mean," thought Kate, " this unusual care about her-taking cold. I should think she was old enough to know how to take care of her- self. But it is not strange, for these widowers al- ways act the fool when women are about." "O no, I do not think there is any danger of tak- ing cold, if I walk fast, and beside I am pent up in the house so much, that I think this bracing atmos- phere will do me good, Andrew."

"Now, I cannot bear my father to look at a wo- man; and if these two old fogies increase their fa- miliar talk, she shall leave this house, or I shall marry the first man that' offers, and leave it myself; " thus soliloquized lRate, yet said not a word. Mrs. Pettifroid ventured forth through the market, and soon had a couple of baskets filled with the best things of the season; then bent her steps toward the residence of her children. She found the two couple -seated around a small stove, in which they had just built a small fire, and were waiting for breakfast to come itself. "You lazy things, why did you not meet me at the corner I here I have had to carry these two baskets, and my arms are nearly broken i' "It is such a cold morning, mother, that we thought we would not venture out, knowing that you would come and see what was the matter-and now you see don't you I " "Yes, and I have a notion not to let you have- anything to eat, for your -laziness."

The winter has nearly passed, and happy were its reflections upon Charles irnd Lambert; for nothing in the wye of pleasures had escaped their attention. They had enjoyed the society of the Italian ladies; had attended the various places of amusement in Florence-spend- ing many an evening at the opera, and many at night in the ball-room: the former seemed a deliciousi pas- time; the latter, a perfect delight. "Charles, I have just been thinking about those Italian-girls at the dance last night-that peculiar shrug of the shoulder, and -those expressive smiles," said the old man, as he and Charles were enjoying a Havana after breakfast. "Don't mention them again; for I am almost in love with M'lle Laconi; she waltzed delightfully last night.

Mr. Lambert soon discovered that his family had been living extravagantly-had made sale of the old Lane house to defray expenses; but that was only equivalent to the fact, by way of vexation, that Charles was going to have a bran-new step-mother; and the fact that Mrs. Lambert had wept the loss of her husband, and was going to marry as soon as a sufficient time had elapsed, was only parallel, with the fact, that Julia was going to take advantage of Charles' absence, and bestow her hand upon George- Lenore; and all these things to take place by the.. first of May.

"ZZIE had already commenced her duties in the seminary, which consisted in her taking charge of some primary classes, while a part of each day she recited in some of the higher classes. Her uncle, Paul Bard, was the principal of this seminary, at Coveland, which had a valuable reputation at home and abroad, on account of the strict rules of govern. ment, and strait-jacket requirements of the institution; which the old fogies of the present day think abso- lutely necessary, to bring up children in a way that they never go afterward. It is enough to chill every spark of innate genius, to be compelled to undergo the daily drilling of certain institutions in this republic. Freedom of limbs and lungs is a stranger to the inmates, and *yet we wonder how so many pale-faced females are seen among the higher class. A seminary off in a secluded grove, yet thoe student is not permitted to talk loud, or laugh out I A hundred acres of land inclosed about the buildings, yet a race or a romp through the tempting grove would be an offense worthy of punishment, and very unbecoming, for fear of showing an embroidered skirt   to strangers; yet no one is permitted to enter the grounds except on business I The Coveland Seminary was situated upon grounds of the above dimensions, with cultivated fore-grounds, while in the rear of the main building was a grove of trees that natured had planted more: than a century past, such as the oak, beech, elm, etc.; yet the timid squirrel jumped from limb to limb, not frightened by the girls, who were sometimes permitted to take a peaceful stroll beneath the foliage during the hot days of summer. Lizzie was permitted to room (as they termed it), with one of the girls of the senior class, to whom she soon became much attached. t Lizzie was loved for her frank and candid manner. She loved Kate, for she was full of life-mischief lurked in her black eyes, and a perfect defiance to anything serious, seemed a prom- inent feature of her character; and it was well for Lizzie, as it had a tendency to drive away those gloomy feelings that persuaded her tO seek such se- cluded society, in preference to the gay scenes of the Queen City. Lizzie had no time here to indulge in the gloomy thoughts of the past, nor opportunity, where Kate was, yet the- iron rules of the institution seemed an impediment to perfect cheerfulness--such rules and regulations as should have perished with -the blue- laws and witch:craft long ago.

Such were only a part of the rules, which were printed upon a card, and suspended upon the wall in each room. Although Lizzie was assistant in the primary clanes, yet she was subject to these rules and their penalties, with the other inmates of the institution, Lizzle never thought of such prison-like precision, and especially from her uncle, but she soon learned never to expect favors' from a relative; in fact, she believed him more strict with her than with the rest; perhaps it was because -she was not accustomed to such strait-jacket requirements. A month or two had already elapsed since her com- mencement, and she determined upon a little freedom of action, even at. the expense of a scolding; so one day after her morning recitations, she ventured forth by herself to take a general view of the dimensions of the grove, by-way of strolling around, although she knew it was against the rules, yet she knew her uncle was hearing a recitation, and would be through about dinner-time; so thinking of matters, she found her , way leisurely along the shell walk uttil- she reached the front gate, where the main road passed that led to the Village ; she here enjoyed a full view of persons, earriagesi etc.   '.  rs 'THE QUES A Cm r     1 - A half-hour thus spent seemed- like a few moments to Lizzie; but to make the best of her time, away she skipped like a fawn, keeping along the outer-edge of the grove; now taking a glance toward the seminary: alas, she beholds her old uncle, looking out of his 're citation window, beckoning to her,. She did not think she had gone around on his side of the, sem- inary so soon. Lizzie now returned with pensive feel- ings to the seminary, reaching there. just as the dint ner-bell rang; they met at the dinner-table; her uncle looked at her with a frown-she knew something was in store for her. Dinner being over, her uncle approached, ." Miss Lane, I wish to see you in my recitation room;" and with dignified steps he marched through the long hall, and poor Lizzie, half-frightened, followed behind. When they had seated themselves alone, Mr. Bard said, "If you know the rules of this institution, how did you happen to be romping around through the woods, at this time of the day, without my con- sent A" "I thought it was no harm, as I was through with my lessons." "No difference what you thought you were through with H-you must not talk back to me in that way!I- I will not permit it, and beside,if my rules cannot be obeyed, I may as well give up the control of my in- stitution at once; no, you must be punished for your disobedience, come along."  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7412-00000077"/> - 15;2    MY    VC TB E IGHBOS Lizzie followed him toward another room.

It was the first time good-natured Lizzie- was ever aroused to such a pitch. Ah, here he opened the door of a large vacant room. "Now, you can stay there the rest of the day, and see what you think of yourself," said her uncle; giv- ing her a push, he closed the large door and locked it. Lizzie now looked around the apartment-not a single thing in the room but herself-not even a car- pet adorned the floor. A long room it was, with a small window next to the grove, which admitted a gloomy light; there was not even a chair to sit upon. Lizzie was now alone in her agony, which you may well term such treatment to one so innocent and timid as Lizzie was. Angry, grieved, and mortified. she sat down in the middle of the floor and wept. The lachrymal fountains seemed broken up, as the burning tears fell fast upon her. throbbing bosom: one moment she would appeal to resolution, and wipe away her tears, and then resolve to run away the first opportunity; then again give way to her feelings, and think what a miserable, unhappy mortal she was; what a fool ehe had made of herself, and what a dis- grace -to the seminary, fearing that she would be hated by her associates, and a reproach to her par- ents; then burst forth in tears; now wipe her eyes, and in her ire would clench her delicate fist, and wish'   Ix THE QUEEN orIT,     158 her uncle Paul would fall down the stairs and break his neck, as she was not large enough to fight him, and beside he might leave Aer somepterty,which would compensate her for such treatment These things run through Lizzie's mind in a moment of time, yet it seemed to her like an age, While in this durance vile, Lizzie heard some one approach the door, and the bolt slide .back in the lock, and that was all, for she heard no one come or. go. She now went to the door, made escape from thence to her room, which she found almost as vacant as the one she had just left, for Kate was absent at recitation. Lizzie seated herself and tried to assume an air of cheerfulness, as Kate came skipping into the room as merry as a cricket, and imprinted a kiss on her forehead. "Why, Lizzie, you have not been crying? Such nonsense-1 would not have noticed such things. I saw old Paul 'taking you through the mill,l as we call it, and I was afraid you would take it to heart. Now, I was in there twice before I had been here a month, and never shed a tear. I see your eyes are all swollen, and you have not been there more than a half an hour, and I have been there four hours at a time, and you would have been there that long, if I had not let you out."

"Father it is embarrassing for me to talk with you on such a subject, but I don't know what, in the name of common sense, you want to get married for, in your old age. I would rather take charge of the work myself, than to have a mistress and stepmother over myself and young sisters; and it will be sevoer enough to Charles to return and find his'mother gone, let alone having a stranger in her place. Another  thing, I don't think-you would be doing well at all, to marry that woman. I should think you would hold your head a little higher, and try- to get some one of a better family.", "That is another frivolous excuse, Kate.

A few days after this conversation, Mr. Winfiel and Mrs. Pettifroid left the city for a week, to vis some of her relatives at the north, leaving Rate t keep charge of affairs during their absence. The bad no sooner started than Mrs. Lambert came in "Miss Kate, your father wished me to tell you thb they will be married before their return, and hope you will have everything in perfect order when the get home, as they will be receiving much companj and Mrs. Winfield will not take charge of affairs fo a while at least." "Much obliged to you, Mrs. Lambert, and I wil try to have everything in the most perfect di8 order." "How yon talk, Kate. I should think you woul( be glad to have your father marry so kind a womat to take ctharge of your younger sisters." '"No one can fill the place of my mother, and it ii only mockery to attempt such a thing." , "Kate, you must not think hard of me, for your father requested me to tell you, and I have done ac. cordingly; so, good day."   \  iDU THE QEBBx tY.:      1?T In the evening Dr. H. called and received Kate's consent to his previous proposal, and also learned from Kate, that the sooner the contract was finished, the better; for she was determined not to reTnaill under the sovereignty of a stepmother; therefore, the doctor was ready to comply with the immediate termination of arrangements. On the following day Kate ransacked the house, collecting every shred of wardrobe, and every little valuable trinket that had belonged to her own dear, mother, from a set of china dishes down to the little shell pin-cushion, and stored them away in a, large old-fashioned chest, ready for any emergency; at the same time keeping her eye on. the old arm chair, sewing-basket, and work-table, which she intended to claim in remembrance of her mother. On Thursday, Kate received a letter from her father, who had been absent since Monday. He wrote that he would be home Saturday evening.. He hoped that she would be reconciled to-the matter by that time, and would make everything look cheerful for her new mother and prepare a nice cup of tea for them, as they would be coming home tired and late on Sat- urday evening,  "Not a drop of tee will I get for them," said Kate, as she threw the letter upon the floor. 'lAh, there is a postscript; I must read that;" and picking up the letter, resumed her reading. "P.

"I wish they had met the sheriff and had the kno tied under the chin," said Kate, throwing the letter into the fire, and nervously resuming some sewitg fo her private benefit. Saturday night came along. Bridget had givel the girls their supper early, and let them retire. "How cold it is, dear, for this season of the year,' said Mr. Winfield, as -he took his lady's hand t, help her from the carriage, " but we are home again and Kate will soon give us a warm cup of tea, an, then we will feel comfortable." *"Mercy, Andrew, how gloomy the house looks- not a light or fire in the parlor."

"Leave my house; you Irish Biddy," said Mr. W., looking for a broom-stick. "'And that's what I'm after doin'," said Bridget, as she disappeared, for the last time through the backl door.

Andrew finds his way to the cellar, while Mrs. W. explored the cupboard, and found a slice of bread a week old, and about a thimble full of tea.

The meeting was very different from what was ex- 'pected. The father seemed happy to see them, and in perfect good humor; gave the doctor his hand, and, Kate a kiss, wishing-them a happy life,- prosperity, etc. He knew Kate was opposed to his proceedings -in getting married, and in her provocation had served them the trick of Saturday night,- and the best retort was to say nothing about it.

COARm. and Lambert were in the height of anxiety to- reach their native land in safety, being perfectly tired of -voyaging, although their journey had been a prosperous one: thus far; and the captain *informed them; that, with' the fair wind they now had, they would reach New York in a -few days; but, from the appearance of the setting sun, and the indications of the barometer, he feared a gale. The white-capped waves are now swelling, and the sails filled to a bending mast; as Charles and company retired, night was advancing, but the moon, which was far above the horizon, had not shown its face through the gathering clouds, that formed a dark canopy over the gallant ship, and reflected their somber forms in the mighty deep. Each moment the gale increased; now the orders to take in sail, were followed by general confusion. The brave bark bat- tling with the storm, aroused every inmate to a sense of anxiety and uneasiness; the angry waves ran high, tossing the ship about, as an empty shell; the lieght-   W TE QufBaN  rrr.,     '168 ning flashed at intervals across their path,- as if to ' make a victim of their vessel before the morning dawn. "Work fast, brave boys!" said the captain, as the top-sail was rent to ribbons, "close the hatchway, the water dashes in." "Captain, is there much danger " said one. -- "Are we lost I " said another. "I never knew the wind to blow so hard--it's a hurricane, I almost fear the result," said the captain. The running to and fro of passengers, the weeping humanity, the pallid faces, the clustering together of friends, now formed an indescribable scene, baffling description. The lightning now seemed one continued blaze, as if Satan had opened the door of his dwelling to give them entrance; the thunder muttered and groaned, as if the Almighty was giving orders for their destruction; the waves beating against the ship, sounded like a death-rattle to their ears. "Mercy, what a crash" 1 said the captain, as the mainmast was swept from the deck, almost'rending the ship in twain. "All is right yet," he continued; to give them some consolation. ' "A leak  she has sprung a leak l" cried one oi the crew from below. "Then man the pumps in haste,"' cried the captain. All hands went to work; morning- dawned, and the storm of a night lulled itself gradually away, ast if discouraged in its attempt to utterly destroy the  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7412-00000083"/> i0o      MY THBBs NEIGMhORS vessel; yet satisfiea with the mastless, mangled and leaky condition in which it left them. With every human exertion they had thus far man- aged to keep the water from filling the vessel, but somee assistance must come soon, as their strength would not last much longer, and they could make no progress in their mastless vessel. Noonday found no assistance for them. The water was gaining on them; they hung out a signal of dis- tress; the day was passing away, and not a ray of hope to cheer their frantic minds. They well knew thfiat another day would never dawn upon their leak- intg vessel. It was almost sunset, as two vessels were attracted to their assistance; all were filled with anxiety and fear, lest they might sink before the vessels would reach them; one of which was a British ship, bound for New York; the other a Spanish vessel, bound for home. They were now within speaking distance, as the captain ordered all passengers on the upper deck. "Be quick, she will not last five minutes," cried one of the crew; "the pumps are stopped-the water is rushing in." General confusion followed; some were grasping pieces of timber, others spring to the yawl, others threw themselves upon the waves as the ship went down like a piece of lead; the life-boats were filled, and many holding fast, who were. not able to raise themselves up; others were keeping themselves up   IN THE QUig," CITY.     t65 by pieces of wood, while the water was dashing in their face, almost strangling them as the two ships came up.  Many were saved and some perished; many of-those taken up were so prostrated that they could not tell whence they came or where they were going. Now we turn aside from the calamities at sea to inquire about matters at home. Mr. Goldleaf's visits had became more frequent since his success in gain- ing widow Lambert's consent. He looks forward to the time when he will form a co-partnership with the proprietress of the Lambert mansion, which time had been agreed'upon, and would take place about the middle of the approaching summer. Julia, however, had fixed upon the first day of May, which would terminate her flirtations with- the young gentlemen, and grant her the opportunity of confining her remarks to George Lenore for life. The time had almost come: as April showers were falling fast, inviting May-flowers to hasten forth'.and deck Miss Julia on the bridal eve. Julia was fond of gathering wild flowers, and had resolved' to ter- minate her pleasures of single life by gathering May- day flowers, and have them witness the happy scene on May-day eve.  Meantime her- intended, George Lenore, busied himself in making preparation for the ' all -important act of his life, and revolving in his mind with much anxiety, whether she could make an affectionate companion, considering how many fellows * ' ^  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7412-00000084"/> "66     MY. TWi NKEIGHBORS she had admired; whether he would be a suitable companion for one so rich and gay; whether his or her affections would always last, and whether the time would ever come as each day seemed like a month. George had strange feelings about this matter, hence such strange thoughts. He often thought of Hfarry's bet,. that he never would marrny Julia. He often thought how old JIambert hated him, and threatened to haunt him if he married her; and even feared the old gent might still live, and make his appearance at some future day. Neither did he for- get his first love, Miss Lizzie Lane, nor his rival, Charles Winfield; but then he thought of the old adage, that the' course of true love never runs smooth, and the most valued prize is the spoil of the hardest -fight. "Ma, my white satin has come from the mantua makers, and fits me handsomely; those other silks will be done this week, I hope they will please me as well. Now what else must I have, as I want to make a grand debut into the marriad world; and, besides the Goosebecks and Blickfords will be here, and you know how fastidious they are about such things." "Yes, daughter, you must go down to Shillito's, and get one of those eoniton Bertha Capes; if it costs ' a hundred dollars you must have it; also that bridal vail, at twenty more than the cape; then you must have a few-of :those fine handkerchiefs, and get one with point-laacearound it, about four inches wide,'etc.   IN THE QUESN CITY67 We might as well make a grand affair out of it this time, for such things do not occur very often in one family; but, my gracious, I do not know how we will keep up appearances afterward, unless our husbands make money like Jehu--however George is a promis- ing lawyer, and Mr. Goldleaf is substantitally wealthy; I think we will be running no risk. Ytet by the time we are both married, we will have the-old Lane house on our back, that is the proceeds of it; and when that is done, they will have to launch out the funds all the time. Don't you think so, daughter E "Yes, ma, I agree with you; but we will not talk longer now, as I must go a shopping." , Julia spent the afternoon in making her purchases, and last calls on her particular friends. In the even- ing, she and her ma had decided upon what persons -to invite, and which minister was to officiate on the occasion; thus finishing verbal arrangements, Julia picked up the evening paper, to read aloud to her ma, as she often did. "Mercy, ma, here is an awful disaster at Sea-fifty or more lives lost; what an awful thing, so many human beings to find a watery grave. Do let us road it and see what it says; here is a list of the missing, let us see if we know any of them." Julia gave a sudden scream, and fainting, fell in her mothers arms. a ".My daughter, what is the mattere" said Mrs. Lambert, as she reached some water from- the side. board and dashed it in Julia's face. 15 ft  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7412-00000085"/> 168      MT TraieM T  NEIGHBONB Jtlia revived, muttering, "My father, O my father is lost!" and Mrs. Lambert, preparing herself for the worst, picked up the paper, and found in the list of missing, the names of Mr. Lambert and Charles Winfield. Here was mystery mingled with grief. Where had Mr.' Lambert been all this time, and how he and Charles should happen to be on the same vessel, were questions that time only might solve. 'Tis enough to say that instead of the white satin dress and nuptial ceremonies, they donned entire black, and postpo*ed everything ; as Julia's grief was too great to think of weddings, for she'loved her father devotedly. Ilence the wedding-day was postponed until the first of August. If the reader could now take a glimpse into the Winfield family under the new arrangements, he would find that Andrew had entirely recovered from his former afflietions; already had the image of his first wife fled from his mind; in fact he strove to banish all remembrance, lest it might sadden his spirits, and unfit him for a cheerful companion for his present wife; in other words, he could not'worship tile living and weep for the dead at the same time. As for Mrs. W., she had married in -a respectable family, her husband was wealthy, which would pre- vent her and her own children from ever coming to want; as she was his private treasurer, she could dis- tribute small amounts with bher children, and theold gentleman never know anything about it.

"I agree with you exactly, and to-morrow I will order a supply of groceries and vegetables," remarked Andrew, as he sat hemmed up in one corner of the fireplace on a Sunday evening. "Besides, Andrew, I must have some funds, to- make some purchases of dry-goods for family use; I only want to get a couple pieces of muslin, a piece of linen, and. some black silk, for I must have a black flounced dress; that is all." "Very well, here is fifty dollars, which is enough; I suppose."  Monday came, and Mrs. W. went a shopping, pur- chased a dozen yards of cheap muslin and a few yards of linen; while Andrew purchased a new supply of provisions by the wholesale. Quite a new era with the Winfields, for they had always purchased as little as possible, and managed very economically; hence they- bad saved up what was now about ibeing scattered. broadcast, for the footsteps of her ions-in-law and daughters were becoming familiar upon the threshold to, which they were once strangers; and Winfield's cellar and pantry were their market-house, where they could buy without money or without price.

TTRiF months have passed; Julia will soon con* summate her happy union with George Lenore - The grief at the loss of her father, was now alleviated by preparation and anxiety with regard to leaving her young associates^behind and joining the list of the married people. Already had she sent a few invita- tions among her acquaintances, particularly those with whom she wished to continue on calling terms, as this was a fine opportunity to cut those who were not aristocratic enough for her associates. To-morrow evening is the time for nuptial cere- monies at the Lambert mansion. This evening, George makes his last call on Julia, to relate how he has succeeded in his preparations, and to learn how Julia has prepared everything for the occasion. He finds Julia in a happy humor, and everything in a state of readiness for the occasion. Their conver- sation this evening is made up of future prospects and happy days in store for them; treating also of each other's peculiar disposition and traits of charac- ter, so that they may mould into congenial harmony with each other those discordant strings of humanity, before it is- too late.  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7412-00000087"/> 172      MY THREE NEIGHBORS "How fortunate, George, I have been, in being left to choose the object of my first admiration; it seems as if it had been decreed that I should marry no one else, for every impediment has been removed, and when I made engagement with Charles it seemed to me that it would never come to pass. You also know how strongly my father was opposed to you: it seems as if Providence has smiled upon us, and re- moved every obstacle-although I deeply regret the loss of my father; yet, were he living, he never would have permitted or consented to our marriage: for I too well remember how forcibly he uttered these words: ' Julia, if you marry that fellow, I will haunt you after I am dead.'  "Well, well, Julia, that is past now; perhaps he was out of humor that day, and might have consented at another time;-yet his opposition would have done no good, for if we were determined, there would have been ways enough to accomplish our purpose; but we will drop this subject, Julia, for I want to know whether we will take a tour north for a few weeks, or remain with your ma, until my house is finished and furnished " "You must be forgetful; we decided a fortnight ago, that we would take a tour and I have every- thing ready for the jaunt."

"I have only invited two or three dozen, as I did not want to go to much trouble, and get no thanks X   rW TS QUEES CITT.      173 for it; beside, 'fools make feasts and wise folk eat them.'" "You are pretty sensible on that subject, Julia, and I do not believe in much excitement on such occa- sions, for when it dies away, it seems as serious as a funeral." "I :suppose some of your friends will be here, George "  "I have let no one know it but my friend Harry, not even my parents for I want to take them by sur- prize. I have given Harry an invitation, for I have a private bet with him for a suit of clothes, and I want him to be here." "What is the bet--I am very inquisitive." "Since matters have gone so far, I will tell you: he wagered me a bran new suit, that you and I would never be married." "Why, what did he mean by that?" "His reasons were that you have had so many beaux, that he thought you would jilt me as you had the rest them." "Very well, let Harry come, we will jilt him out of a new suit, sure enough." Thus was the evening spent in-conversation, until George took his departure for the hotel; he soon reached his room, and retired to dream of wedding- cake and mothers-in-law.

Everything was now in confusion, caused by the unexpected guests. However, since they could not have a wedding, they were invited to a feast, of which they partook heartily; supping sufficient wine to cancel their disappointment. They separated quite early for their homes, cogitating in their minds, what would be the result, and rendering their sympathy for George Lenore; all knowing that Charles had the first claim upon Julia. As for poor George, he went home almost frantic with mortification and disappointment, while Harry gave him encouraging-words; telling him that it was better that the remonstrances had presented themselves before the wedding than afterwards. George tried to bear up manfully, knowing that the old gent was opposed to him, and that Charles would have been his perpetual fear; yet his decision was not sufficient, for he and Harry imbibed freely during the night, and the morning found both of them temporarily oblivious to all that had happened the previous evening, As for Julia, the following day found her fast re- covering from the severe shock upon her nervous system, caused by the return of her father like one coming from the dead; but to-day she is able to converse with her father, who relates his adventures   mt TEm QUEUN CIYr.     179 in the old world; his being shipwrecked and how they were picked up by a Spanish vessel and carried to' Spain, thus having been tossed about nearly five months on the ocean.

'THE surprise of the Winfields at Charles' return was great, but not equal to the pleasure thus afforded them by his delivery. He was glad to see once more the remains of his family, although it seemed as if the loss of his mother had taken away the greater part of the once happy circle, and especially to find the vacancy filled by a stranger, seemed like a mockery; hence the introduction to his new mother was rather a cold formality. Charles' first impressions were not equiva- lent to motherly love; and after Kate and his younger sisters had told him of their more than imagined ills, his second impressions were still less favorable. Poor step-mothersl they have a thankless office to fulfill, and not one of a hundred can succeed har- moniously, especially where there is a family .of grown-up children.  A single word of authority from a step-mother, makes her a tyrant; while a single act of disobedience on the part of the children, is an unpardonable insult to the step-mother, and must be reported to the father, and accordingly pun. ished; thus creating hatred and discord in a once happy family; for the father always takes the side of the wife against the children.   IN THE QUBN o Tr Y     183 It now had been nearly a year since Mrs. Winfield took charge of Winfield's affairs, the result of which had not been very profitable, as his expenses had been more than double that of any-previous year; yet he was not aware but what everything was going on prosperously, but the children could see how it was, and these discoveries had created perfect hatred to- ward her, who was scattering to the four winds what their mother had earned, toiling by the midnight-lamp to assist their father in gaining what he now possessed. They plainly saw that a few years of such loose man- agement would soon sweep everything, and leave them without a penny at their father's death; yet to intimate her artful extravagance to their father, would be the height of folly, as he thought her-infallible, and it would only bring his^wrath upon their own heads. Yes, he thought her without fault. Why should he not for he had evidences of her piety and fidelity; for if at leisure, whenever he came in, she was perus- ing the good old family Bible, which lay upon her lap with the last novel underneath; as soon as he was gone, the novel took a chance. If gadding the street all day, she was sure to get home just before he did, knowing his regular hours, and when he came in, complain of how hard she had toiled that day, when the two little daughters had done the work. But that was not all, for she not only did nothing about the house, but in her anxiety to make her own two daughters comfortable, had taken almost everythng portable to them, from pins needles and pockethand-  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7412-00000092"/> 182     I MY THRRtE NEIGHBORS kerchiefs, to rocking-chairs and gridirons--even the family library had been reduced and sold to second- hand book-stores, and the proceeds went in the same channel; and if Mr. Winfield missed anything, he was told that his children destroyed them. One evening after tea, the old gentleman and his domestic angel were sitting alone in their room; as he complained of not feeling well, that there was an oppression on his lungs, and feeling low-spirited, remarked, that he thought he would not live a great while. Here was a chance for her to propose an idea that she had previously kept to herself. '"Yes, my dear husband, what should I do if you were to die; as I am getting old, it would be very hard for me to make a livelihood." "Don't worry, wife, I will try and make some money before I die, so that you will not come to want.' "But, dear, I think you ought to have your will made, so that if you died unexpectedly, I would be sure to have something. Your daughter Kate has married, and doing well; Charles will marry soon, then he and Kate could take care of Blanche and Cliffie, as they are young, and can easily get along, therefore I think you ought to bequeath all your property to me; and you ought to make your will Isoon, as life is uncertain, and death sure." "Very well, I believe I will leave to my children a small amount, try evade the law, and to you my two homes, and my money."    J THE QUEERN CtrY.     183 "I think it would be no more than right, 'and I am glad you take such an interest in me ; I -hope you will attend to it soon. You look tired, husband; but-before you retire, you had better give me some market- money, as you may forget it in the morning; and, while I think of it, some, also, to get Blanhe -and Cliflie a black silk each, with flounces, low neck, and short sleeves, which I know will become them, and I will make the purchase to-morrow." "Very well, use your own judgment about these things," said Andrew, as he launched- forth some visible means, and prepared for retiring. On the following day, Mrs. Winfield purchased a few vegetables, but donated the rest of her funds to her two daughters--managing to make Blanche and Cliffie a dress out of her black silk, which she had dyed a" few weeks previous, which made the third time Andrew had given her the price of the same silk.  Charles was at home the evening of the conversa- tion about the will, and had overheard the same, therefore his feelings were aroused almost to despera- tion; but he could do nothing more than relate the affair to Kate, when they would sit down and pro- nounce malediction on their step-mother. To speak of Charles personally, we find him pros- pering finely in his prospects for a wifey as his chances for Julia were restored by his return; she seemed to have a greater attachment for him than before-the rejoicing was as great as that upon the 16  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7412-00000093"/> 184      MY THREE NEIGHBORS return* of the prodigal son. Charles' return had entirely disjointed the engagement between George and Julia, for various reasons. She only loved George, because she would soon need pecuniary assis- tance from somef source, and because she had no better offer after. Charles' absence; but since his return, necessity became a, virtue in renewing her old engsgement, as he was her father's choice. The old coals were easily kindled, hence matters pro- gressed'finely; 'having already appointed a day in September- when she would again attempt to, give herself away., As for George, she had heard nothing of, and cared but little for him, since Charles' return. "Here, Julia, is:a letter for you; the penny-post just handed it toy me, as I was at the door,' said Mrs. Lambert, as she and Julia seated themselves, to know who it was from, and hear the news.

"Don't you believe it, daughter; ai poor girl like her would think it an honor to get a young man that you had been engaged to; but you know I don't permit you to have anything to do with her, since that slan- der case."

Lizzie had almost thrown off her former troubles, by being absent from the place where they originated, and from not having time to think about anything but her class and recitations; yet she had not forgotten George, although she thought it neces- sary, from present prospects, to banish him from her memory, which she had accomplished far enough to prevent any sediment of gloom, which is often the re- suit of disappointment or blighted affections. There was only one thing that worried Lizzie, and that was anxiety about her'parents fearing that they were not comfortable, although she sent them all her earnings. This evening Lizzie sat alone in her room, as Kate had gone into an adjoining room to see a schoolmate who was ill, for hardly anything else would separate them. Lizzie had just prepared her lamp, and sat down for a lonesome study as her uncle Paul entered the room. "Here, Miss Lane, are two or three letters; I think you, had better open a private post-office for your own accommodation, if your correspondenits in-  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7412-00000095"/> 188      MY THREE NEIGHBOUS crease as they have lately. I have looked over these and if any more such love letters come, I shall de- stroy them, without your knowledge: here is a hnn- dred dollar bill, which was inclosed in a letter from Julia Lambert: I don't know what; that means, but you can send it to your ma, as you need not think of purchasing finery, to put on airs with, about this seminary, and that's enough!  "Very well, uncle, I will do as you direct.' "Exit Paul.  "What does this mean I?-three letters all at once; who can they be from?-I wish Paul was in the dead-letter offilce-look at these broken seals-down- right sacrilege!" "Ah, Lizzie, talking to yourself again ; there must be something wrong,', said Kate, entering the door, which had stood ajar. "O no, Kate, nothing wrong; I have received some letters; we will see what is the news from the Queen City-I will read ma's first.," Julia reads the letter. "Kate, what do you think --Charles Winfield and Mr. Lambert have returned-or come to life rather, for do you not remember of reading their ship- wreck last spring " "Is it possible, Lizzie!" "Yes, and that match is broken off between Gebrge and Julia.' 'Hurrah, Lizzie, you will have a chance for George, yet." *   .   .

"I suppose, Lizzie, you are glad of that, for you will have no further cause to be jealous of your friend Julia."  "I was over that long ago, Miss Kate: I would as soon she would marry Charles as George." "I do not doubt that, Lizxie-only a little rather." "No, Kate, I meant vice versa." "Stick to what you have said, Lizzie; you were right the first time." "Kate, you must not think I would be, made a dupe of because I once loved the fellow, for I would not marry the fickle-minded fellow for his weight in gold." "Ah, Lizzie, I like to hear you talk that way: it is a good sign-I have heard folks talk before: I am going tor intercede for George-I think it will come out right." "I wish you would hush-you are a perfect tease; come now, keep still; this letter is from my friend Julia; she writes happily about the return of her father; sympathizes with me, and remembers her vows, which were that 'I should never want while she had anything;') and here she sends me the savings of her pocket-money, to repay our loss at their hands. You remember, Kate, how we lost our property, as I told you about that slander case. She says nothing about George nor Charles-that is very singular-but here is a note that came in Jllia's  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7412-00000096"/> 190      my UtiEf NEIGHBORS letter: what can it mean --it seems to be a letter from George to her since their marriage was broken off; he states in it that he never did care anything for her, but wants her to intercede between him and myself. Ah, I understand: she thinks I will write to her, giving George encouragement, but she will miss it very much. George may do his own courting and interceding, but he need not come this way." "' What did I tell you, Lizzie? everything is tend- ing toward your assistance-it will all come right." "There you are again, Kate, on the same tune. Why, I will have nothing to do With him, although I don't believe that he ever did love Julia." ' Nor I, Lixzie -.1 don't believe that he ever loved anybody but you." "Kate, you are a tease-I won't talk any more about it, but you will see." Here the clock struck nine, and the seminary bell sent them to retire, as suddenly as theIrish girl prays at the chime of the cathedral. This same evening George Lenore called at Lane's to ascertain the whereabouts of Lizzie, but Mrs. Lane was excused from seeing him: he therefore obtained no information. He would have almost despaired at this, had not Harry given him some encouragement, promising him that he would find out where Lizzie had gone to. On the following day, according to promise, Harry called on Charles Winfield, from whom he obtained the desired information.   - N THE 4UNN OITr. Y . Upon informing George that she was at the Cove- land Seminary, he said he would write to her imme- diately. "And, Harry," he said, "if I get a favorable an. swer, I will bring her away from there in a Short time; what do you think about it t" "Well, I think you will have to strike a better vein of luck, than you did with Julia; if you succeed with her now, you will have to conduct yourself in a very strait-forward manner. .You must write to, her one of your nicest letters, and be careful not to revive any subjects that bring up unpleasant remembrances of the past." "Don't discourage me, Harry." "I do not wish to; but I am afraid you are build- ing up your hopes too fast on a slim foundation; but proceed and write your epistle, as I will leave you alone, while I attend to some business down town." Meantime George accomplished his epistle for Lizie and sent it by post to its destination. In due course of things the letter reached Coveland, but it was only through accident that Lizzie was ever permitted to peruse it; for, of course, Paul Bard opened and perused -the same, muttering to himself "What a love-sick mess," as he stored the document in his pocket and resumed his duties, fully resolved that Litzie should not see it, but thought he would send it to her ma. After the toils of the day were over, Paul thought to show the letter to his wife and get her opinion as to 17           '  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7412-00000097"/> 1i9S     MTY H1MtA E NEIGHBORS its disposal; but lo, it was gone, he must have dropped it somewhere.

Lizzie laid the letter upon the table for further con- sideration.   m THE qus Nerrs.       195 CHAPTER XXII. OFF TO THE NEW COUNTRY. SEPTEMBER has just passed; having recorded the nuptial ceremonies of Charles and Julia, as they had agreed upon one destiny in the tide of life, and the minister had sealed their obligations, they now start upon their voyage with new impulse-bright hopes glitter before them--mundane happiness seems in store for them; the world seems to revolve, and the sun to shine for their especial benefit; their path is strewn with flowers; friends pour blessings upon their heads, wishing them long life and much happiness. They look back upon their past life as a desert, with here and there a weakly shrub, or stagnant pool; they look forward to Elysian fields, with silver streams and verdure covered banks, amid groves of perpetual green, alive with the melody of birds, and fragrant with the sweet perfume of flowers. Bright hopes are often blasted; yet it seemed as if nothing could mar their future happiness, since they had the old folks to take care of them, while they resided in the Lambert mansion-so they sat down, and folded their hands, and looked at each other, as if to say, let us eat, drink, and be merry. Honey-moon thus passed away, when Charles re.  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7412-00000099"/> 196      MY THREE NEIGHBORS snmed the clerkship in his father's business, at a moderate salary; while Julia Winfield had nothing to do but receive and return calls-the forenoon at the toilet, the afternoon in some parlor: being disposed to pass the days in that manner, while evenings, and almost nights, were passed at the theater, opera, con- certs, and ball rooms; thus keeping pace with the fashionable entertainments of tfie day. 'Twas a dull, rainy, Saturday evening that Charles and Julia would not venture out, but thought to enter- tain themselves at home, as the old gent entered their room, and found them in a cozy chat. ".Take a seat, father.'" "Thank you, Julia, I will, as I want to consult you about your own affairs." "Very well, father, I hope you will give us some good advice; as your age and experience will permit you to impart some outlines for our future'welfare." "But, Julia, you may not be prepared for my new arrangements, but I will tell you my desire." "' Go on, father." "I think you and Charles had better choose a small and comfortable house, and go to housekeeping for yourselves." "What are your reasons, father." "Well, I think young folks ought to always shove out and do something for themselves; for they will have it to do some time, and the younger they are, the sooner they will learn. What do you think, Charles "   IN THE QUEEm onr.      197 -' I have no objections, I am sure.': "Very well, if you will discover a house that suits -you, I will furnish it for you neatly, but not ex- travagantly." "Thank you, I will look for one on Monday," "Now, Charles, I do not make this arrangement because I am unwilling to assist you, for I will do just as much as if you were here; and when I die, I shall leave what property I have to you and Julia, for you are my only children." With this the old gent lade them good-night. Charles and Julia, making a virtue of necessity, soon come to the conclusion that housekeeping. would be the nicest thing after all. They could furnish their table to suit their own palate,-could open their house for parties and company, and, in fact, could live to satisfy their own taste exclusively. 'Twas done as quick as said; for on Monday, Charles obtained a respectable dwelling on Fourth'Street. The old manl furnished it according to promise, and in a week from the first mention of it they were comfortably ensconced in their new home-so we leave them. A month after this, old Mr. Lambert came home in the evening-seemed to be worried about something, and the old lady noticed it.   l "Well, Lambert, what is the matter now t You seem to,be agitated about something." "Not much, I guess; but I suppose I will have a little trouble to quiet the title of a piece of property, as I received a notice that such would be the case at  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7412-00000100"/> 198      MY THREE NEIGHBOR8 the next sitting of the court," at the same time hand- ing her the legal notice, which she perused. "My dear husband, I do not understand this-what does it mean? Who is the instigator of such pro- ceedings!" "Well, that young fop of a lawyer, George Lenore, thinks he has discovered something that will benefit somebody, if he can only find that somebody; who, he says, has a better title to a certain piece of pro- perly than I have." "Mr. Lambert, it will worry me to death, in my old age, if we are to be tormented by such fellows, and meddlers in other people's business." "You need not fret, my lady; I think it is only a ruse gotten up by him to annoy me, and he thinks I will give him a bonus to still the matter, but he will find himself mistaken; and, besides, I believe the man I got it from has died long ago, therefore he will not find him." "Yes, but it is such an annoyance to have folks meddling with our property, as if we had obtained it by swindling. Will it be tried in public a" "Certainly, it will be in the public court-house." "Dear me, then everybody will be talking about Lambert's swindling somebody, just like when them Lanes had made such a report. I don't know what to do--I feel as if something was going to happen. Now I was down to Julia's to-day, and they talk of making a change, and they have only been housekeeping a month ."  -    . (    IN TRHE -UEEN CITY.    199 "What now--what's up P" "'Well, Mr. Winfield says he cannot pay Charles much salary now, and after awhile he won't need him at all, but proposes to give Charles a small farm up in the country, if he will take his family and live on it, and work himself. Charles has accepted the proposal, knowing that he cannot live in the fashion on small means; and, dear me, I would as leave bury Julia, as have her go up in the country among the heathen ; but I know they'll go-I feel it--they will do it," here the old lady choked up and sobbed. "Pshaw, there's no use of fretting, wife; I think it the best thing in the world for the young cubs, for I am not able to do anything for them." "Yes, but only think, husband, after all the trouble I have had to bring her up in style and elegance, to have her in the country, climbing fences and wading through the mud. Why, after she had been there a year or two, she would look like a mighty, gawky thing, walking along Fourth Street. It's too bad!" "Where is the farm." "Julia says it is adjoining yourbrother Jacob's farm." "Perhaps that will be the more pleasant for them to have neighbors with whom they are acquainted; but when do they think of going "    - "I believe, husband, they are going just as soon as they can get ready; for they will have to prepare the farm for cultivation in the spring."

"I believe, Mrs. Lambert, that Mrs. Winfield is as artful as Satan, and that the old man is perfectly blind to her conduct, and permits himself to be completely governed by her whims. She is pulling the wool over his eyes, and Julia says, she is trying to worry him out of the way, and then get his property. And how should he fancy such a creature; she is continually on the street, and looks like Meg Merriles. She is a by- word among the boys; I have heard them call her race- hose, camel, trotter, peddler, and I don't remember what else; but she seems to have given room for such names, for I always see her out with two, baskets and a bucket, and sometimes all full at once, and she often seems to be carrying them away from home; I suppose it may be for some poor families; if so, she should have some credit for being charitable." . "Yes, if so, Mr. Lambert; but her charity. all goes to one place, and that's where she has,a couple of overgrown daughters and their lazy husbands to sup- port, who live in an obscure street, and are as poor as a desert rat But that is their business-we will. let them attend to it, as I never like to talk about folk,   IN. THE QUEEN CTrrY     201 You are weary, you had better retire, and I will see if the servant has things prepared for the night." A few weeks passed away-Charles Winfield and lady were bidding adieu to the Oueen City; provisions and agricultural implements had been provided, also some means from the old folks, to assist them until they could reap one harvest, to establish their independence. They, with their furniture and baggage-wagons, arrive at the humble cottage in the evening. The men, after unloading, return a short distance to a country tavern, where they put up for the night. But young Mr. Winfield and lady were almost lost amid the boxes, barrels, bundles, and bedsteads; and her feelings were almost like that of Pauline, on exchang. ing her father's mansion for a common dwelling; to be sure this -was a neat cottage of frame, with two large rooms in front, and two small ones in the rear;. the latter two, of course, were intended for bed-rooms, while one of the front rooms must suffice for a dining- room and kitchen, the other for a parlor, drawing- room, boudior, etc. But these acc9mmodations did not suit Julia, alto- gether. The sudden change did not agree with her constitution, but what could be done? They must put, up their bedstead, or sleep on the floor. They must get their own -supper, or do without. Here was a dilemma, and Julia's- tender hands were never made to work; and so she thought, as she threw herself upon some bedding, and wept at her conditionm  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7412-00000102"/> 202      MY THREE N GHBOR "Come, Julia, don't fret in that manner. You can- not help the matter by crying." "Go away, Charles, don't speak to me. I don't think well of a man who would drag a delicate female to such a miserable abode.' "My dear Julia, don't go into the hysterics; you will find this a very comfortable place, when you get used to it." "It may suit you, but I was raised very differently, and I want you to let me alone. Don't talk to me, I can't work-I won't. I know I shall die here; get me a drink, I shall faint. I feel awful, go quick I " Charles ran out to the well, where a bucket was suspended to a long beam, a la mode countrie. He soon lowered the bucket, and brought it up full, and ran toward the house; when suddenly the pole and chain jerked the contents upon his face and head, thus preventing him from fainting and learning him that the bucket did not unhook: he gave it up, while he returned to look for something'to get water in, but everything was nailed up in the boxes; and when Julia saw how the matter was, she began to feel better, and concluded to do without, if he would let her remain quiet. It was getting dark in the' house, as Charles built a fire in the huge fire-place, and commenced to open their boxes, etc., in order to have some supper, if he, had to get it himself. In the course of an hour, you might have seen the large iron tea-kettle suspended from the crane over the huge fire, and the coffee-pot   rs THE QUBBN OITg.      208 steaming away on some coals, and who was the cook but Charlie. In the meantime Julia had aroused her- self, and was sitting pensively before the fire, while Charles was wrestling with the pots and dishes, good- naturedly, whistling his favorite tune, "Love Not;" while he arranged the table with some cold corn-beef, bread, butter, etc., not saying a word to Julia, who was, no doubt, considering the best way to turn a new leaf. But the supper was soon prepared; which consisted of a cup of coffee, a cold check, and a good appetite. Charles looked around to see if everything was in order,-set a couple of chairs to the table, then ad- vanced almost in front of Julia, and proceeded with a jovial and polite invitation: "Mrs. Winfield, will you walk out to tea- " It would have done Julia good to give vent to a hearty laugh, but she turned her face away-bit her lips, knowing that it would not do, so soon after such a spasm: however, she arose, took a seat at the table, and proceeded, by pouring out a cup of coffee, which she seasoned with some sugar, but looked in vain. for milk. "Why, Charles, what will we do for milk y" "Ah, that is a fact; I think we can get along with the milk of human kindness, until we get a cow " said Charles, as he burst into a laugh. "That is old, and nothing to laugh at in osuch a miserable place as this," added Julia.

Here their progress was impeded, for there was not a knife' or fork on the table; a few minutes search soon prepared them for completing their supper after which they went to work, arrang- ing furniture for a night's lodging. j   -18l TH 48ffiX;O '    205 CHAPTER    XXIII.

"Yis, Hwill answer that letter, Kate; but I shall want your advice as to what shall be the nature of the epistle; for if I send George a flat refusal of recon- ciliation, the poor fellow will kill himself for I am vain enough to think that he has the highest regard for me." "You mean, Liszie, he is deeply in love with you." "You may say that, Kate, but we will not investi-n gate that now, for I want to know if it would not be best to write him a cool letter, not sufficiently hostile to his proposals to distract him, nor afifectionate  enough to give him a sudden encouragement; or, as an editor would say, neutral on all 6ubjects except religion." "Since you have appealed to me, Lizzie, I will say that unless you wish to reconcile the matter, I cannot see why you would write at all, for the very actsof an- swering his letter would give him encouragement un- less you give him to understand that you wish no further intercourse; at the same time, I would rather you would use your own judgment about it, as you are the interested one, for I would not marry him for his weight in gold."   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7412-00000104"/> 206      M TBEB NEIGHBORS "Why not, Kate " "O, I did not mean that; I just said it to iet you know how it sounded, for I heard a young lady about your size use the same expression, one evening not long since." "Very well, Kate, I say so yet; but I thought I would treat him with some respect." "Yes, Lizie, write him a letter of respect now, after while, one of honor, then another of regard, and winding up with one of affection.' "K ate, yo are a perfect tease. I don't know what -you get your conclusions from, but you are deter- mined to have me reconcile the matter, whether I wish or not, but you will find yourself mistaken. Now you may retire, and I will write something to suit myself." "That is what I thought, Lizzie; that you would ask my advice and then do as you chose. But no dif- ference; I will retire, and I want you to tell him, that if he is looking for a wife there is a chance at Cove. land Seminary.  Give him my love, and tell him I will not deceive as Julia did; tell him that I am a perfect mischief, and good company, etc. etc.; in other words, give me an epistolary introduction, and tell him to write to Kate ---, Coveland, care of A.

' Very well, Kate, you may have him if you choose. I will write as you say." The conversation here terminated, and Lizzie pro- ceeded with her task, for such it was, as she did not know whether to give George encouragement or not; and now she was fearful that Kate might win, if she did not improve the present moment, for she intended to do as Kate requested; for it would be c6onsidered a school girl's joke, if nothing more. But what if George should write to her, and then if he should visit her? Ah, here was a dilemma, for Kate was a charmer, and Lizzie knew it. Now Lizzie's feelings and thoughts could almost have been read in her countenance, and among other ingredients there was a little jealousy. However, she accomplished a letter which Patrick put in the office, for two shillings as hush money. George Lenore had begun -to think that he never would hear from Lizzie, as it had been two Months since he had written, and the only consolation he had received, was that he had called on Lizzie's mother and learned that the young ladies of the seminary dare not correspond with young gents. He. had determined to visit Coveland, but he knew that they would not receive calls, and, besides, his business oc- cupied all of his time and attention, forbe was about entering an important suit with Lambert, provided he could find a certain individual, who, though not 18  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7412-00000105"/> 208      MY T"^ci NEIGaBOmS aware of it, was the legal owner of some property which Lambert held. His search, thus far, had been unsuccessful, yet he was determined to ferret itout for two reasons; one was, for the fee, the other a de. termination to annoy the proud family. At evening George was sitting alone in his room, trying to cogitate some plan to obtain aninterview with Iiazie, or at least to find out whether it was pos  sible or not. While thus meditating, his friend Harry came in. "Well, George, you are in a brown study; perhaps I have something to cheer you up." "What have you for me, Harry " "I inquired at the post-office, as you requested, and received a letter for you, post-marked 'Coveland;' now I don't want- you to commit suicide-here it is."

"My dear George, I don't see any enigma about that letter-I think she has given you tit-for-tat: you jilted her, now she has given you the cold shoulder. She says if you want her, you can have Kate: so I think your ' cake is dough' up there. You had better ' hang your Wrp on the willows,' and wait until you get better looking."

"When are you going, George!" "I will go to-morrow." "You had better go to-night-I would not wait until morning," said Harry ironically. "Is there a train *oing up to-night?" asked George, rising from his seat, as if he was, about to take Harry's advice. Harry burst into a loud laugh. George now saw Harry was jesting and taking advantage of his sanguine movements; however, he would risk the journey and reception at Coveland on the morrow- on his own responsibility, knowing that a venture could not make the matter any worse. Ac- cordingly the first train of the morning was boarded by George Lenore and a few hours fqund him transe ported to the neat little village of Covedale, which he thought was an enchanted place, being the residence of the object of his affections. He took a room at the first hotel in town, as there was but one, and that a poor specimen: compared with the city hotels; yet that was good enoogh for him, as he was seeking other enjoyments at this tiPe of more importance than hotel entertainments. He spent a half- hour in his room, arranging his toilet, theq walked down to the gentlemen's ordinary, which was a very large, ordinary room, with a tall stove in the  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7412-00000107"/> 2       M12 'iEU I W t "TORPOB9 center of the floor while the wall were- decorated with large circus bills; a few chairs and no carpet complete the furniture. Some halfdozen country gents took an inquisitive stare at him as he entered, one of them, however, getting up, offered him his seat by the stove, which George accepted with a polite- bow, and sat down to enjoy a Havana while dinner was being prepared; not that he cared much for din- ner, but thought-best not to make any calls until after- noon. He sat still, smoking and meditating what conrse to pursue, hardly noticing who was about, while these rastics fed their optics upon the appearance of a city gent as if it was -good for sore eyes. He, however, aroused himself to externals, and began a conversation with his company, inquiring about the location of the streets, the residence of A. J. -- (Kate's address), also eoncerning the seminary, some, thing about its principal, by-laws, etc., etc. He soon found, from the information he received, that it was as unapproachable as Gibraltar. Here dinner was announced, and followed by a rushing of men and boys, tumbling over chairs and benches, making more noise than a dozen sheep run- ning over a pile of shingles. George followed to see -what was the matter, and found it terminated around the dinner table. There were several: vacant seats at the table, hence he could not understand the rush, but concluded to eat his dinner before it was de, soured, 9s they were "pitching in!"as if working -by the job and paid aocordingly.   nr THS AEoulN Ovtrr.    18. Dinner over, George took a walk in'seareh of Mr. A. J. '"--- , hoping to learn when, and hw Misses Lizzie and Kate could be seen. He found the place, and the gentleman at home, but received liitlde encour. agement as, to a personal interview with the young ladies, as he was informed that Kate was only there occasionally, and Lizzie Lane, they knew nothing about, and learned also that no one but a rela* tilve could get to see the students at -the seminary, He now bade his informant good-day, and bent his steps toward the seminary, thinking he might get a glimpse of Lizzie and Rate, by walking around the seminary. He reached the grove, but its picket fence kept him sufficient distance from the building to pre- vent his recognizing any one if he had seen them, but he walked slowly around until he came to where he started from. He could not assume courage enough. to enter the premises and inquire for the ladies, as he might get himself into difficulty, and make it unpleass ant for them; he endeavored to devise ways and means during his walk, until he found he had walked around the inclosure the second time without accom-e plishing anything. He then concluded to return to the hotel until he could conclude what was best :to do, yet fully determined not to leave town until he had ac- complished the object of his visit, at all hazards. He loafed about the hotel the balance of the day, passing the time as best he could, thinking perisaps, the mor- row might present something more encouraging. -He passed a   restless night,-and morning came, but llo-  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7412-00000108"/> 214      MY T')cr NEIGHBORS thing seemed to assist him in gaining an interview. He finally hinted to the landlord that he wished to see a young lady of the seminary, and did not know how to proceed, when the host told him that to-morrow be- ing Friday, they always sent up to the post-office for the letters, and if he could get to see their man, Pat- rick, when he came after them, that he might make some arrangement with him, to get word to the young lady that he was in town. He also informed him that Patrick came up about 12 o'clock. George here found some relief, thanked the landlord for his information, and puffed away at his Havana, which seemed to be much finer flavored than the previous one, and, meantime, concluded to wait patiently until the morrow. George knew not that he was already creating a sensation in the little town or corporation, and al- though he had only been there two days, was ternned the Mysterious Stranger; and why was it, unless be- cause he seemed to have no particular business, and was acquainted with no one I He was neither ped- dling pills nor patent-rights, had plenty of money and no visible means of support; in fact, folks began to think he was a gambler or burglar, for he was so well dressed, and he certainly would not be stopping there without intending to make a haul before he left. George was not aware of such opinions, although he thought the people stared at him sufficientlyjto know him the next time he came. But this is a great peculiarity of country towns; no sooner does a stran-   IN THE QUEEN CITY.     21 ger arrive than every one takes at look at him, and then walks around and looks at him in another direc- tion; then the boys run home and tell their sisters that a fine looking man has just arrived with a big trunk, and brass buttons on it. Perhaps he is going to live there and take portraits, or open a store, and so it goes all over town like electricity, and so it happened everybody knew that George Lenore was in town, and wondered what was his business. But Friday came, and the stranger was still in the cor poration; yes, this was actually an incorporated town of about five hundred inhabitants, with all the rig. ging, mayor, council and sheriff; and the sheriff, by this time, was aware of the presence of a stranger, and had been notified by some of the citizens, to keep his eye on him while they went home and put padlocks on their back doors. George remained in the gent's ordinary, by'the small fire (yet it was not cold), until toward noon, when he walked toward the post-office. He had not been there long, when Patrick stepped up and in- quired for the seminary letters, which he received, and was starting away as George spoke to him politely, "Sir, I beg leave to trouble you with a few ques- tions about the seminary, as I am a stranger here." said he,t "An' that would be perfectly right, sure, with your honor, sir."

"Well, give her this letter, and don't let Mr. Bard know it, and here is a dollar." "' Thank you; an' sure Lizzie will git this, an' half this money I will give to the praste, and git drunk on the other half on Christmas; an' its g6od day to:your- self." "'God dday, Patrick " They now parted. George went to'the hotel to await his destiny, while Patrick hastened to the sem- inaryi having been detained longer than usual; they were at dinner when he arrived,.so he walked around the table, taking a peep at the girls; he delivered the letters to Prof. Bard. As he passed out, he gave   IN THE QUaEN OITY.     21 a consequential look at Lizzie, which she thought meant something; perhaps she was looking for a pri- vate letter from the city; but Patrick was now at his wit's end to know how to get the note to; Lizzie with- out any one seeing him. Ah, here a thought popped into his head, that the hall needed sweeping out, that passed Lizzie's room, and with the Thought he gath- ered up a broom and rushed up there, knowing that Lizzie would soon return from dinner, ,and that was his chance. No sooner had he commenced operations, than Lizzie come skipping up to her room, all alone, as she had finished dinner sooner than any one else, and Patrick met her at her door. "An' faith, Miss Lizzie, an' it's myself that saw your beau, an' a finer lookin' gintleman niver came from the holy sod of Ireland, itself, than that George Lenore." "You are joking, Patrick."

"Why, Pat, why did yon not give it to me imme- diately p" A footstep on the stairs set Pat to sweeping with all his might, and Lizzie closed her door to keep -out the dust. She had just taken a seat and opened the note as Kate came in. "Ah, ha, I thought something had taken away your appetite; but where did you get a letter and from whom!" "I will tell you, Kate-of course you will say noth. ing-but Patrick says George Lenore is in town, and gave him this note for me; let- us read it, for I am anxious to know what it means, and what he is doing here." FRIEND Laz nZ: I have come to Coveland on purpose to see if there is any possibility of getting to see you, and of having an understanding about our former affairs, as I cannot possibly postpone the matter any longer, without knowing whether I may be reinstated in your good will, and the old engagement renewed, which was broken without a cause. A few words will suffice in this note, for we can converse better than write. I know there are difficul- ties in our having sociable meeting, on account of the strict laws of your seminary; yet, if you will do as I request, I think we can have a friendly chat without the knowledge of the old folks. It is this: if yourself and your confidant, Kate, will go quietly down to the front door of the college   TO TBB QUlBHS AIto      219 building, precisely at eight o'clock to-night, I will meet you there on friendly terms; that is, I would rather not see you than to stir up old and unpleasant things; but if your are disposed to be friendly, and forgive, and forget the past, then you will be there; if not, your absence will signify it. I have no objection to your having Kate with you, as you would be timid by yourself; and beside, I have nothing to say this time, that I could not trust with your companion.    Your sincere friend, GEORGE LENORE. "Now, Kate, if you want to see George, this will be your chance." "Yes, Lizzie, and if you wish to see him, now is your time."' "What do you say, Kate--will you go down with me?" "Of course I will; but what if Paul should find us out " "Pshaw  he will be safe in his room before that time, and know nothing of it: we will venture it for George's sake, for the poor fellow would be disap- pointed." Meantime George was whiling away the long hours, anxious for the appointed hour, to know his destiny; and had he known how closely he was watehed, he would have scarcely undertaken anything; for "the excitement was getting higher, and he had evenl , watched during his conversation with Patrick, ad they supposed he was trying to get some information out of the poor fellow about the seminary bnuildings,  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7412-00000111"/> 220      MY TuRA NEIGtHBORS  and likely that would be the first place of his depre- dations. He At all events, the time wore away, and supper was passed, and about fifteen minutes of eight o'clock, George walked toward the seminary; it was star- light, and not very cold; yet George thought he would not detain the girls long in the night air, as they were not used to it; hence he had in mind a condensed form of words to submit to the ladies, and particularly Lizzie, should he be so fortunate as to see them. He walked slowly along, and as he opened the large gate carefully, his heart seemed to make more noise than the gate, as it was making active vibrations from suspense, as to his nightly adventure. He walked hastily down the shell-walk, and soon dis- tinguished two forms in the large open door of the seminary ;-a few moments and he held Lizzie's hand, - while she gave him an introduction to Kate; it was a sociable meeting, and hard to tell which was hap. pier, George or Lizzie, and a few words soon satisfied George that all was well; he made 'his requests and remarks to Lizzie, then appealed to Kate very politely for approbation, who, of course, decided in- his favor all points of dispute. TAL..io turned around to look through the hall to see if any one was about, as Paul Bard was going to lay his hand on her shoulder. She gave a sudden scream, and was about falling out of the door, as George caught her, until she regained' her feet, for she was only frightened.   IN TE qUESES OITY.      221 At this moment, tie sheriff and his assistant seized George rudely*And despite all protestations, hurried him off to the village. George found that, with an officer on each side of him, he had better walk along without any resistance, and try to convince them that they were mistaken in the man; but it was all of no avail, for they had been watching his movements for several days. He was taken to a substantial room in the sheriffs dwelling, fixed for that purpose, until the regular jail was finished; here he was ex- amined as to deadly weapons and skeleton keys, but finding none, they left him alone in his glory to await his trial the next morning, before the magis- trate, on charge of assaulting two young ladies, with ill intent, etc. "Now, I have made a fine thing of it," thought George to himnelf; "here I have come up to this one-horse-town to see the ladies, and got into the lock-up the first peep, and don't see much chance of getting out on a habeas corps. I suppose by to-morrow I will be tried for an attempt to murder; I will have to send for Harry; and then those poor girls, I have them in a nice difficulty, for Bard will have them tried for standing in the door after night, and there is no telling when I will get back to the city. Gracious, I will say prayers and retire." How much he slept we cannot say; but the morning found him ready to plead his own case. At nine o'clock, a quorum was formed in the magistrate's office, sufficient to try the important case.  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7412-00000112"/> Y TH19KI0 NEJfBf7PORS George was brought in before his Honor, accom- panied by the two officers who arrested him, and Paul Bard. was present, who with the officers, were the only witnesses against him. He now informed them that he would plead his own case, and that he wished them to issue a subpoena for LiTzie, Kate, and Patrick, and also wished them to bring the letter that he addressed to J, iizie Lane on the day previous. Of course, a deputy was dispatched for them, but Paul had them locked up in a room for their disobedience, and had to accompany the messenger to get them out. When they arrived the trial commenced. The officers were first to testify, and their evidence corresponded in the facts that they saw him approach the seminary in a stealthy manner, and by the time they reached the place, by a circuitous route, they saw him take hold of the young lady in a rough manner, and heard her scream. Paul Bard now testified that he was looking about the seminary to see if everything was in its proper place, when he saw a young man approach the young ladies, and did not know what was his object. Next came Lizzie and Kate. Their testimony cor- roborated the fact that they had been informed that he would make a call that evening, and, knowing it was against the rules, Lizzie concluded to see him at the door, and that Kate merely accompanied her out of consideration for Lizzie's timidity. They further related how they received information that he was going to call. George here requested Lizze to pro-   I   IN TIE q9UES ITi ,    223   duce the letter which would show the object of his nocturnal visit. Next, poor Patrick was brought up to state what he knew about it; and they soon learned that he "met the gintlemun at the post-office, and that he carried the litter, unbeknoWns to Prof. Bard." The evidence being through, the magistrate thought the case would not bear argument, and that Mr. Le- nore only wished to visit the ladies, and was obliged to take that plan on account of the rigid laws of the institution; therefore, he was released from custody. The audience now dispersed, thinking the matter a pretty good joke, and concluded it was a lesson not to be so suspicious of strangers. But Prof. Bard was angry to think such a fop could make such inroads upon his affairs without punish- ment, and concluded that Liyzie and Patrick should forthwith leave his premises. Such decision, however, was hardly necessary on Lizzie's part, for she had de- termined to leave after being shut up in a room and not permitted to have any breakfast, and did not know what would have been the result, had she not been sent for, and that now she was free, she intended to remain so, and informed her uncle of the fact as he was starting home. She let him go alone while she bent her steps toward the interior of the village, intending to remain with a friend there until Monday, and then return to the Queen City, being perfectly tired of old fogy seminaries. Kate returned to the seminary, after bidding Lizzie   &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7412-00000113"/> 224      MY THRTE NEIGHBORS an affectionate farewell. Paul set Kate to packing up Lizzie's property, and told Patrick to carry the trunks after they were packed, up to the hotel, and then in- form Lizzie where they were; and as soon as that was done to pack his own and clear out. Poor Kate had lost her chum, and as she gathered up the articles and stored them away in Lizzie's trunks, she wept as if death had separated them, and forlorn Pat did not know where he would rest his head; yet before night Pat and all the baggage were at the hotel. He there met George, and related to him his misfortune, who told him to remain at the hotel until Monday, at his expense, and then he would take him to the city and give him plenty to do and a fair compensation. In the evening (it was Saturday), George made a call on Lizzie, and was treated-by her acquaintance as a gentleman; had, a cozy little tete-a-tete with Lizzie without molestation. On Sunday evening he repeated the same; and on Monday the trio came happily away from Coveland, and arrived safely in their home city.   IN THE QUaN CITr.      225' CHAPTER XXIV. THE WILL.

" Yes, Andrew, I will fix some herb-water, for you know that will be good, as you know I am the best kind of a nurse;--just remain easy-it will not take but a few minutes; but I will have to go down stairs and leave you alone again."

"I will know all about it, for I bottled it, and have it in my pocket, and will analyze it before I retire." When the doctor reached home, he proceeded to examine the compound. He soon discovered that its chief component parts were morphine and deadly night-shade, two most powerful sedatives, the latter a deadly poison, and had Mr. Vinfield drank the same, it would have been his last sleep. The doctor thought it best not to tell Kate of his discovery, but concluded to let the matter rest until morning, knowing that Ktate would not rest while her father was in such danger. Morning came, when the doctor related the whole affair to Kate, and further stated that Mr. Winfield must not be left alone with her, until he was able to bear being told what had happened.

Here they were all interrupted by the return of Mr. "'Mr. Winfield-you have given me the wrong paper. 1 suppose you thought you were going to die, and had your will ready; but I did not wish to read it'" "You must be mistaken, Mr. B--, I have never made awill " ' "Well, sir, here is the paper-you can have it, asnit is not what I want;-I will bid you good day, as I am in as hurr ; - you can hunt up the agreement and send it down to the store."

Just at this moment Mrs. Winfield gave an awful shriek, and fell upon the floor in a hysterical fit; one scream followed another, while she lay and kicked, as if getting up a revival on her own hook. The house was thrown into some confusion, while the doctor sug- gested the idea of letting her kick it out.  A forged will was now manifest, and it explained also the drug-tea, that was prepared the evening pre- vious. The doctor here related to Mr. Winfield his expe. riments with the drink his wife had prepared for him, and concerning its poisonous contents.  By this time, the treacherous woman had nigh ex- hausted herself in shouting; they assisted her to a bed in an adjoining room, where she had an oppor- 20 s   &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7412-00000117"/> 282      MY TWRRi NEIGHBORS tnnity to reflect upon her situation,-to enjoy the sweet reflections of " living in clover," as she termed it; or rather a chance to submit to the lashings of a guilty conscience, to review the artfulness and du- plicity of her past life,--to look upon her miserable self and weep. And now was the first time that she had ever been checked in her career of sin, which had its birth in a desire to take small things that did not belong to her; and a disposition to talk about everybody, which kept her continually maneuvering to keep herself out of difficulty. When she slandered any one, and was likely to be detected, she would charge it upon some innocent person, and these formed the base of her career, which had increased her talent and desire for scheming, that every day added a new variation to her plans; but now she was detected in her grandest effort, and just in time, for she might soon have con- nected herself with the Wall street brokers, or opened a wild-cat bank in a Western State.

GEORGE LENORE had searched in vain to find the legal owner of certain real estate held by the Hon.* Mr. Lambert; at last he inserted an advertisement in a daily paper, as follows: "If any person knowing the whereabouts of Joel Bur- ner, who formerly lived in Cincinnati, will call upon George Lenore, he will be suitably rewarded," etc. In the evening George called upon Lizzie--found her at home, as in former times. During the even- ing, Lizzie inquired who this Joel Burner was, and why he had advertised for him in the evening paper. a' Joel Burner was an Irishman, and lived out near Deer Creek, a few years ago, and since his removal, I find no trace of him," remarked George. "What would you do if you did find him-does he owe you anything?" "O, no I he does not owe me anything. I have business of more importance than that." "1 did not know anything could be more important. But what is it?" "If I could find him I would have the pleasure of putting him in possession of an estate, receiving a good fee for my trouble, besides having the eatisfac-  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7412-00000118"/> 284      MY- W TW NEIGHBORS tion of revenge on a proud family that attempted my ruin." "Is it possibleu I don't understand youn" "It is very plain, Lizzie; for he was, and is yet,r the legal owner of the Lambert property, and I am' determined to aggravate them." "Very well, George; what- reward will you give" if I tell you where to find him "  I believe you are teasing me, Lizzie. Do you know anything about him." "But what reward will you give " "If you are in earnest, I will give twenty-five dol- lars reward to know where to find him; and if I gain the property I will give four times that amount.' "Well done, George, I will show him to you. Fol- low me!, Lizzie took the lamp and bent her steps to the attic', room, Seeing a small light in the room and knowing that he had not retired, they walked in. There sat Mr. Burner in, his lonely room; his bent form and hoary locks seemed to demand a degree of veneration from his young visitors. -He laid up his pipe as Liz- zie introduced George Lenore; at the same time ask- A  ing his pardon for interrupting him at such a late hour.

"I expect that will be very fine, indeed," said Julia, thinking to herself that she would rather attend an opera. "Where is your husband " "He is out on the farm, fixing the fences for spring." "But how in the world do you get along, as neith- er of you know anything about farming?" "Charles has a German to help him, and I have some cook books, by which we are enabled to get along; but you would have been, amused one day at my churning. I churned nearly the whole forenoon, and then Charles churned until his arms ached; then we found that the bottom had come off from the dash- er, and that we had been punching the cream with a straight stick."

Good day, Julia." "Good bye, aunt; I hope you will come over quite often." It was not long before Charles came in. "Julia, what beggar was that I saw going away from the house a few moments ago " "Be careful, Charles, how" you talk, for that was our aunt Lambert; she lives on the farm adjoining ours." "She was dressed mighty commonly, I think." "Well, the women folks all dress in their linsey dresses up here, and I expect to have one before long, for I am losing all my pride, and don't care how I look, as I don't get to see anybody; and then we can't afford to wear fine clothes, where one is tearing them all the time on these worm fences, as you call them.

"Now, Julia, I am so tired, you go and get a small arm full and let me rest." "Charles, I would not mind it if it was not for that nasty fence, for it is a great annoyance, and I should think you would have the wood placed on this side, but I will go and get some if you will promise to put the wood in a more convenient place next time." "Ah, she is going to be a good housewife," thought Charles to himself when she had gone upon the er- rand; but a sudden scream aroused him from his chair, and with a spring he was soon out in the yard, and discovered Julia in a predicament. She had made a hasty descent upon the opposite side of the fence, and her dress had caught upon a large splinter while her toes were just touching the ground, and she could not turn around to unfasten it. Charles soon relieved her, then he had a hearty laugh while she pronounced a few maledictions on country life. However, she was so frightened that she could neither carry wood nor climb the fence; ergo, he took down the fence, and then carried in the wood himself. Julia, however, soon prepared their tea, and they took their evening meal.- "Now, since you have had your tea,I will furnish the dessert," said Charles.

Yet let happen what will, I hope it will not affect your happiness in your comfortable home. Your father, l- j-L JAMBERT. Julia threw down the letter, and fixed her eyes upon Charles, who seemed to be intensely interested, as if to let him speak first, knowing that he was ex- pecting something of a fortune from that source, and that sihe-now, could see what effect a disappointment might produce on him." "I think that is very strange. I don't see how that George Lenore could affect his title, if it is good for anything; and if he has come by the pro- perty by foul means, I cannot understand why your folks always put on so many airs, as if you were in- dependently rich."   - IN THB KQEED CITY.    8'  "Come, Charles, do not cast any,.reflectiohs, for it may come out well, and if not, it is too late: now to mend the matter."

"Ah, indeedl Your father told us that even- ing when he wanted us to go to house-keeping that he was going to leaveyou his estate."

IN THE QUEN0, CITY.     243 CH AP TER    XX:VI I. CONCLUSION. THV spring term of court decided the great Lambert case, in which Burner gained the estate, with its im- provements, the latter being allowed to him as equiv alent to the annual income of the lot, during the time it had been in the hands of Lambert; yet it was necessary for Burner to pay the mortgage which had never been foreclosed, according to law, which amount he wass able to obtain from George Lenore, by giving him a mortgage for the amount,:and'4also for a fee of one thousand dollars for obtaining the property. Mr. Lambert bore his loss manfully, as perhaps he had anticipated it long before; but, his wife could not beat the misfortune-such a descent from her usual mode of living, was too much: such a fall of pride, and prospect of poverty, overpowered her. She grieved and refused to be comforted--he died. The family had been called- together, not only to witness, for thez last time, the loved one of the family, but to perform the painful duty of bidding farewell to the old homestead-a -task that came as heavily upon Julia as it once did upon Lizzie Lane--then the loss of her mother added, made it tenfold more afflicting.  While Julia was ransacking the house, and gather- ing up treases, remindful of her mother, her hus-  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7412-00000123"/> 2414:    DMY ' HUiTcV NEIGHBORS band and her father were off about the city, trying to drive away their troubles in any diversion that society might offer. She was alone, toiling and weeping, when her dlong treasured friend, Lizzie Lane, came in; Julia was happy to see her; yet there was no room in her heart to express it, for her troubles were gathering thick and fast, as one trouble never comes alone, and she knew not where they would stop; she was fearful of her father entering into scenes of dissipation,and that she might lose Charles' affections; but -Li4ie came to give her that consolation she had once re- ceived from her, and in cheering tones spoke many oothing words to Julia, who was weeping with her head gently resting .upon Lizzie's shoulder, as they were seated upon a divan. Lizzie promised that she should never come to want, while it was in her power to do anything; and intimated, also, to Julia, that she soon expected to get married, and knew that then she would be able and willing to give her a home, at the time entirely forgetting that Julia's husband had a farm in the country, and also that her intended hus- band was at variance with Charles and Julia, es- pecially since he had been instrumental in Lambert's losses, Yet all this made no difference with Julia and Lizzie, for they had ever been firm friends, and still remained so, aside from the many incidents that had a tendency to destroy that intimacy. "Lizzie, what has been transpiring of late about the city," asked Julia, who seemed revived by Lizzie's company; "as I  hae b #pp sento all winter and   IN THE QUEEN OITy.     245 troubled so much, I hardly know what is occurring of late." "I expect I know something. about old Mr. Win. field (excuse me-I should have said your father-in. law), that you have not heard." "What is it, Lizzie?" "Did you hear about the forged will that Mrs. Wifield had executed?" "O yes, I heard of that."    i "And about her attempt to poison Mr. Win- field " "Yes." "Well, yesterday he obtained a, divorce from her, without even allowing her alimony." "Is that true, Lizzie " "Yes, I saw it in the evening paper." "Well, that is the best news I have heard. I knew she had been absent ever since that spree, as I call it, and I was afraid the childish old man would forgive her; but I am glad he did not. Where is she now, Lizzie " "She is living out at the edge of the city, with her lazy children. They do a little work at dress-making, but they cabbage so much, that folks are afraid to - trust them-I mean the   daughters,-and the old woman has hung out a shingle, 'Mrs. Pettifroid, For- tune Teller, Clairvoyant,' etc., and they live like cats and dogs."  "Can it be that she has come to that, izzie I how- ever it just suits. her: only I almost wish she wouid  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7412-00000124"/> 246      MY T1HHeO NiHBBOBRS starve, for father Winfield says she has just robbed his house completely." "Don't wish her any bad luck, Julia, for she will get her reward ;-but, dear me, how late it is: I must go home; take good care of yourself, Julia, and keep cheerful until I see you again; good-bye." And away went Tiszie as suddenly as she came in. She had forgotten that she had much to do at home, having become so interested in Julia's company, that she had remained with her longer than she intended. "My dear daughter, where have you been so' long, when you have so much to do?" "Don't scold, ma, for I was in company with Julia, and we had such a sweet time." "I am not scolding, daughter; but we have so much to do by hext Thursday evening, that we will not be ready, if we lose any time, as this is Monday, and Thursday will soon come." "First thing, ma, I will slip out and complete my purchases. I need some collars- and, pocket-handker- chiefs; as soon as I return, I will prepare the sponge cake and ladies'-fingers. George is going to present me with a large fruit-cake."' So all hands seemed to be busy at Mr. Lane's, as if something was going to happen-and so there was. 'Tis evening: George Lenore is sitting quietly in his room; a porterenters, leaving a large package, containing a full suit, just from the draper's. No sooner is he gone,'than a boy enters with a sample of fruit-cake   IN THE QUEEN OIT.      247 "I want to see Mr. Lenore." "That's my name, sir." "Your friend, Harry, sends this as a sample of Mr. Louden's cake, and says if you like it, to go there and purchase yours."  "Thank you, sir;" and the boy made his exit. George picks up the small package of cake, and bends his step toward Lizzie Lane's. On his arrival, he finds Ti47sie is in high glee. "What is this package, George " "That is a sample of some fruit-cake I want you to taste;--if you think Louden makes good cake, I will purchase there." "Indbed, George, I cannot, for I have been tasting and cooking sweet things all the afternoon-any more would make me sick; beside I never eat such things at night,;-I will leave it to your judgment." "Very well; I shall give it a fair trial, as I am almost hungry for something good." Having eaten a portion. they continued chatting upon various sub- jects. "Lizzie, I cannot say that I like that cake," said George." After a half hour of pleasant chat, George again remarked, "Lizzie, I do not feel well, at all, this evening." "Perhaps you have taken cold, this changeable weather." "I think not; a cold never affects me in this way."* "I will go and see ma, perhaps she can give you  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7412-00000125"/> ";88    MW THRRr NEIGHBORS some 'old woman's remedy, that will relieve gout," said Lizzie.  Lizzie left the room for a few moments, and re- turne with her mother. George, in the meantime, had reclined upon the sofa, and complained of feel- ing much worse. They were frightened as they looked on him." "My dear George, what is the matter!" "Indeed, Mrs. Lane, I cannot tell; but please cross the street and bring the doctor." Lizzie was off in a twinkling, without even a bon. net. George grew pale; a cold sweat covered his brow; his eyes looked wild. TLimie and the physician now arrived. It took the physician only a moment to decide that George was poisoned. Lizzie shrieked and ran through the house like a maniac, at this announcement. '0, O doctor, will he die "A repeated Lizzie, with her hands clasped, in anxiety. "Behave yourself, child; we will do our best to save him." George was now suffering much, and almost insen- sible. They had him conveyed to comfortable quar- ters, where they administered powerful antidotes, as it was a critical moment. Night- passed slowly, as they watched by his bedside, with anxiety and sus-. pense, until morning dawned, by which time there was a very favorable change, giving hopes of a speedy recovery. The cake had done the mischief. Harry was sent   IN ,THE QUEEN CITY.     249 for and be came, but knew nothing about it. No pos- sible conjecture-could be formed as to whence it came or why. Thursday evening came, and George was able to stand before the minister and exchange vows of eternal fidelity with Lizzie Lane; she had now taken the name of Lenore, and they were happy.  But poor Julia had now another links added to her chain of trouble: neither her husband nor father had been seen since Monday, being nearly a week of dire suspense, worse than she had ever undergone before. She had wept the loss of her father once before, but now was added that of her husband. She lived in anxiety and suspense; the hope of their return, was the only buoy of her existence. She now resided at Winfield's, and they used every means to cheer her drooping spirits. Two years have elapsed. - On last New Year's day, I called upon George Lenore and lady, who reside in the Lambert mansion, opposite the old Lane cot- tage, Lizzie having become heir to the mansion at the death of Joel Burner. Her husband is a prominent lawyer, permitting her to live at ease, and she may often be seen riding out, in her coach, under the charge of Patrick, of Coveland. Charles and father-in-law Lambert have returned from California, and now live upon the estate of A. J. Winfield (deceased), enjoying the fortune they ob- tained in the golden-land. Charles, of course, was  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7412-00000126"/> 260      MY TRHYB  NEBGHBOBS heir to his father's property adjoining the Lambert mansion, where he resides with his wife, her father, and his two sisters, Blanche and Cliffie, which make- up the now happy Winfield family. The intimacy still existing between Julia Winfield and Lizzie Lenore soon spread to their husbands, who "smoked the calumet of peace;" thus it happened that the two families become very intimate and neighborly, and many a pleasant evening they spend in rehearsing together their ups-and-downs and family revolutions.
