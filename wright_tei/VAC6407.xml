            <head>DEDICATION.</head>
            <p>IN this age of prolific intellects, neither author nor editor is compelled to search
               for a patron of letters amongst a horde of illiterate and conceited noblemen,
               addle-pated princes and lords; nor is he, in this progressive country, constrained to
               beg the favor of some distinguished demagogue's name to give caste or currency to the
               lucubrations of his brain, or the compilations of his industry. This may be regarded
               as a very favorable change in the times, yet it is not without its inconveniences,
               which the editor has fully experienced. Not being bold enough to violate a
               well-established precedent, and send his volume forth into the world without a
               DEDICATION, he was for a while sorely perplexed in his inquiries for a proper person
               to whom to inscribe it. Although modern progress could freely dispense with the
               patronage of the nobility, it still retains the practice which perpetuates their
               former importance in the literary market. Thus the author who is too cautious to
               trample upon a time-honored custom, is frequently no little embarrassed in his
               laudable efforts to observe it, not having an array of aristocratic vanity, ever
               ready to be redeemed from its insignificance through a lying dedication, from which
               to make a choice to please his fancy.</p>
            <p>True, the editor might have determined to send his volume adrift under false colors,
               by writing some imaginary creature's name upon the title-page, and then dedicated it
               to himself,—for which, no doubt, he could have found precedents enough.<pb n="6-7"
                  xml:id="VAC6407-00000004"/> After giving to this idea the careful deliberation to
               which it was entitled, he came to the conclusion that no better expedient could be
               devised to provide him with an even disposition; for should he hear his name noised
               about by every fool and knave, who are always so vociferous in their praise or
               censure as to overrule entirely the worthier opinions of the wise and honest, his
               temper would never fall below the seething point. He therefore wisely avoided, in
               this wilful manner, to hazard both his character and his happiness. "But," he hears
               you ask, "had he no rich and flourishing acquaintance, who would gladly have
               permitted the inscription, and verily believed it a great honor?" He is not so
               fortunate (or unfortunate, if you please,) as to be without at least a score of the
               kind; but not one of whom would have failed to degrade his book, through a cursed
               propensity "to turn everything into a speculation." Then, too, he might have
               dedicated it to some personal friend, but upon looking around, he could see none whom
               he particularly desired to own as such, except a few poor fellows with whom he
               occasionally whiles away an entertaining hour on a gloomy Sunday. Amongst these,
               however, he recognised none whose poverty,—than which few things sooner fall under
               the ban of the world,—did not seem too heavy a burthen to be borne by so unpretending
               a production.</p>
            <p>In this dilemma, his benevolence, perhaps a little influenced by the thought that the
               man who reads his book is his best friend, came to his aid, and he at once concluded
               that it should be generously and freely DEDICATED TO THE READER. He is not impelled
               to this by a design to propitiate the favor, to influence the judgment, or to
               moderate the criticisms of any one, but simply and solely by the charitable desire of
               pleasing all. He thus provokes no one's envy by showing more favor to another, and
               gives to each the opportunity of having a book dedicated to himself. Lest, however,
               the editor should furnish but another illustration of the maxim, that "they who seek
               to please all, will surely succeed in pleasing none," it is here carefully set
               down—that should any not wish the distinction sought to be conferred upon him in this
               dedication, he may rest well assured that it was not in the least designed for him.
               With this happy disposition to accommodate all he has only to ask of the reader, that
               his book be not consigned, before ascertaining what it is made of, to some murky
               closet, to keep company with the dusty and decaying volumes already imprisoned there;
               and for the faithful observance of this request, he subscribes himself,</p>
            <p>Most respectfully and sincerely,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it has been established as a precedent that every book should have a dedication,
               it has been more imperatively enjoined that none should make its appearance without a
               preface. These are matters of punctilio which it might appear ill-breeding to
               neglect, and constitute the soft and easy civilities through which books find favor
               in the eyes of their readers. As no one is disposed kindly to welcome the rude boor
               who intrudes into his presence, and without a polite nod or pleasant smile at once
               encounters him with rough speech, so none is inclined to enter upon the perusal of a
               volume without first knowing somewhat concerning it.</p>
            <p>Now, it is only necessary for the editor, in the discharge of his trifling duty, to
               inform the reader that sometime ago the records of an old association came into his
               possession. The precise date when this junto was formed could not be definitely
               discovered, yet it has been certainly ascertained that it was gifted with a very
               peculiar kind of life—surpassing, in the tenacity with which it adhered to existence,
               the nine lives ascribed to the cat. Though it had been defunct, to all appearances,
               more than a dozen times, it was as often revived to flourish again for a brief
               period. Not many years have elapsed since it received its last blow; but whether this
               has given it the final quietus, being neither a diviner nor prophet, the editor
               cannot decide: yet he is inclined to the opinion, that if those of the<pb n="10-11"
                  xml:id="VAC6407-00000006"/> present generation will do nothing to restore it to
               life again, their rising posterity will not suffer it to sleep in peace.</p>
            <p>It was the design of this organization to unite the useful with the amusing, and each
               member was required to furnish his quota of the one or the other. The consequence was
               that a large number of papers were collected together, some of which are now "for the
               first time given to the world." Whether the world will do them the honor to value
               them, remains to be seen; yet the editor flatters himself, that in the deluge of
               literature which this age is incessantly pouring forth upon the poor reader, they
               will float along with the endless array of small craft, and perhaps his book may
               prove as successful as some others in contributing its just portion to produce the
               wreck and ruin of some better and worthier production.</p>
            <p>The Magi of Persia were at one time the depositories of learning. With us the people
               are the Magi, and although their unaccountable tastes and Quixotic fancies have
               heretofore elevated into note the effusions of many a fool who experimented upon
               their discrimination, and permitted the productions of some very wise men to sink
               into utter and irredeemable oblivion, the editor still trusts—if not to their
               judgment, then (which may be safer for him,) to their good-natured indulgence. He is
               fully aware that his book contains nothing above their comprehensions, and is not in
               the least apprehensive that they will condemn the RECORDS, as an old council did the
                  <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Petit Office,</foreign> because "<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                  >signo</foreign>" was spelt with a C instead of an S: much less does he fear that
               his freedom will be endangered for the reason which prompted the same council to
               arrest the Prince de la Mirandola, because "so much learning in so young a person
               could only be acquired by a compact with the devil."</p>

                  <head type="sub">PREFIXED TO THE FOLLOWING TALE, AND SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN
                     BY THE SECRETARY OF THE JUNTO.</head>
                  <p>THE author of the following paper vouches for the correctness of the whole
                     story, having himself received it from the person who enacted the part of the
                     spirit therein. When it was read at our meeting, a large number of listeners,
                     who had been enjoying themselves in promiscuous conversation, were seated
                     around the table in a cheerful circle. Although some were at first inclined,
                     perhaps more from a habit to find fault than from a displeasure at the tale
                     itself, to cavil at and doubt it rather than to be amused, there was an honest
                     and bewitching humor in the face of the speaker which alone seemed to entitle
                     his story to full belief: so that by the time he had finished it, but one or
                     two continued serious, whilst all the rest at once agreed that it was
                     creditable in every particular. Whether they were not influenced to this
                     conclusion more through their mirth than their careful judgment, I could not
                     well ascertain; yet I am disposed to think, they merely meant to "take the
                     story for what it was worth."</p>
                  <p>An old gentleman now advanced, who had not only been careful all his life long
                     to avoid the frivolities of the world, but who had also experienced some of its
                     rough realities, if true inferences were deducible from his care-worn
                     appearance and<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6407-00000007"/> thread-bare garments.
                     Not satisfied with what had been read, the old man gazed inquiringly into the
                     speaker's face, and then so overwhelmed the poor fellow with troublesome
                     questions, that he resolved from that moment never to read or narrate another
                     story, without previously demanding a solemn pledge from his auditory that they
                     will remain content with what he may choose to give them, and under no
                     circumstances trouble him for further explanations. Whilst thus pelted with the
                     old man's queries to his great relief a smiling little gentleman stepped up,
                     and turning to the questioner, told him that every story would be spoiled by
                     too much minuteness in its narration; that wherever he found a blank he should
                     fill it up with his own fancy, otherwise he would experience nothing but
                     annoyance; and that the moral of the tale he had heard, simply warned him
                     against too strong a love for worldly things,—a warning for which I could see
                     no necessity in his case,—so that if he should ever be tempted by spirits or
                     ghosts, he might avoid the alarming fatalities which so seriously afflicted
                     poor Hans Dundermann.</p>

                  <head>HANS DUNDERMANN: THE DUTCH MISER.</head>
                  <p>ONE of the most foolish and deplorable passions that could possibly influence
                     the conduct of men, is that wretched penuriousness so frequently encountered in
                     our intercourse with some of our fellows. We often find it the object of hatred
                     and contempt, of disgust and ridicule, and even of a bitter malice which, if
                     not just, seldom secures censure or elicits rebuke. We rarely see it exhibited
                     to a very marked degree in men of substantial intelligence or liberal
                     experience in the socialities of life, and its generous interchanges of
                     friendship. When discovered in such, it is usually the part of discretion to
                     avoid, if possible, a close intimacy with them. The wider range of their
                     knowledge, and their greater sagacity, though rendering them less contemptible,
                     only make them the more dangerous. It not unfrequently, however, constitutes
                     the ruling principle of those not possessed of a superior order of
                        intellect,<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6407-00000008"/> and whose ideas of life
                     are measured by the narrow aims for which they contend and struggle. This may,
                     perhaps, be greatly owing to the fact that wealth consists of material things,
                     which they can readily see and appreciate; whilst the riches that pertain to
                     mind and heart, not being directly visible to them, are beyond their
                     comprehension.</p>
                  <p>I have a German acquaintance who resides in a small village at which I
                     occasionally sojourn, and who is known by the euphonious nomenclature of Dutch
                     Hans Dundermann. Whether this be the name he lawfully inherited from his
                     paternal ancestors, or whether certain peculiarities of which he is remarkably
                     possessed, and which are by no means well calculated to render him an agreeable
                     companion, or make him a desirable neighbor, can claim the credit of having
                     obtained, for him so musical an appellation, the villagers have not yet been
                     able positively to determine. However he may have acquired this title of
                     recognition, which can be matter of small consequence to the present generation
                     of the villagers, and much less to their rising posterity, he is one of those
                     inveterate misers who have no scruples to check their desire for acquisition,
                     and whose parsimonious propensities invariably incur general ridicule and
                     displeasure. Whatever of good may be in their compositions is totally
                     overshadowed by the sordid motives which usually govern them, and thus they
                     always prove successful in arousing the disgust of all with whom they may come
                     in contact. This miserly element in Hans Dundermann's character is so
                     exceedingly prominent that it is supposed to counterbalance and control his
                     entire nature. It is constantly urging him to the commission of acts which his
                     neighbors readily construe into heinous offences, and it has accordingly earned
                     for him no very enviable reputation. To describe to any one acquainted with him
                     the height of petty and disgusting meanness, it is only necessary to use his
                     name in the adjective form; and the attempts to do so are not unfrequently even
                     more ridiculous than the subjects which occasion them. Hans, however, though he
                     may exert himself to increase his store, if not absolutely lazy, is not free
                     from the slowness of his native race; to which he adds a stupidity so
                     excessively Dutch, that scarcely anything beyond the glitter of a coin can make
                     the least impression upon his mind.</p>
                  <p>After thus briefly introducing my acquaintance in as favorable a manner as
                     circumstances permit, I will narrate a little incident in the adventurous
                     portion of his life, which occurred whilst he was yet in the vigor of manhood
                     physically, and intellectually no better off than he is now. Time, which never
                     progresses without making some changes, has utterly failed to renovate or<pb
                        n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6407-00000009"/> improve him. Whilst advancing years
                     have worn upon his bodily powers, apparently the only thing impressible about
                     him, experience has had no effect, either for the better or worse, upon his
                     mind, into which no idea, unless connected with his ruling desire, seems
                     capable of penetrating. A life so selfish, and absorbed in the contemplation of
                     one thing, and that by no means as well intended to expand his intellect as to
                     contract his heart, can afford but little of adventure; yet the trifles which
                     we sometimes encounter in such a life, are so peculiar in their nature, or so
                     marked in their effects, that we welcome and enjoy them the more. They often
                     provoke our merriment or elicit our surprise, excite our admiration or awaken
                     our sympathies. The cold torpor which becomes natural to the inactive man
                     through the eternal sameness of his daily career, renders him a fitting and
                     interesting object for our gaze when he is drawn into positions demanding the
                     exercise of his energies. Whatever may be the effect of the occurrences here
                     related—whether their recital may interest or prove tedious—they certainly
                     constitute the most prominent events in the life of my acquaintance, the Dutch
                     miser of the village.</p>
                  <p>A party of young men who had for years been in the habit of congregating twice
                     each week at the southern corner of the village school-house, to review the
                     gossip of the neighborhood and amuse themselves with boyish sports on the
                     pleasant play-grounds of the scholars; or, by way of variety, occasionally to
                     contrive some idle mischief to disturb the equanimity of the usually quiet and
                     industrious villagers; at one of these frequent meetings determined to exhibit,
                     in some extraordinary manner, Hans Dundermann's passion for money. Various
                     expedients were accordingly suggested, and duly discussed and considered, until
                     they finally resolved upon one supposed to be capable of accomplishing the end
                     in view. After levying a contribution amongst themselves of all the antiquated
                     coin they could obtain,—for they wisely concluded that he could not be aroused
                     from his accustomed stupidity but through the instrumentality of such a
                     token,—the sum was secretly conveyed to him. This was accompanied by a very
                     mysterious letter, which purported to be the favor of some supernatural power.
                     It spoke of the coin as coming from an almost inexhaustible fund, and
                     generously concluded by fully recognising him as a judicious person to be
                     entrusted with the care and keeping of so valuable a treasure. As was
                     anticipated, this had a marvelous effect upon him. He straightways connected it
                     with a standing tale of the village, which he had heard upon different
                     occasions, and which had more than once greatly excited his curiosity. It was a
                        well-circulated<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6407-00000010"/> circulated
                     tradition, (and what town has not a similar one?) that many years before the
                     village numbered a score of substantial buildings, vast treasures were
                     undoubtedly hidden in its immediate vicinity. He had frequently heard how a
                     wealthy Englishman, at a time the date whereof was never definitely fixed, had
                     lived near the village in all imaginable splendor, and how he had died without
                     leaving even so much as a shilling to be found upon his entire premises. This
                     splendid gentleman (so runs the tradition,) had been the descendant of a
                     prominent English nobleman attached to the house of Lancaster, who, when the
                     Red Rose drooped under the terror inspired by the triumph of the house of York,
                     had gathered together his estates, which of course were very large, and retired
                     from the kingdom. The union of the two Roses, which followed the extinction of
                     the Plantagenets, and the partiality exhibited by Henry VII. towards the
                     Lancastrians, never tempted him to return. The last of his descendants,
                     inheriting all his wealth, yet depressed by the death of friends and
                     connexions, eventually emigrated to America, and took up his abode near the
                     village. Here he revelled in all the luxuries that riches could supply, and
                     when nothing was discovered after his decease, the great surprise of the
                     villagers soon conjured up numerous tales of hidden wealth, which have ever
                     since been carefully transmitted to each succeeding generation. It was with one
                     of these that Hans associated the mysterious epistle.</p>
                  <p>After they had thus interested the miser's feelings, one of the company visited
                     him on the evening of the following day. When brought into the presence of
                     Hans, he commenced a train of very vague remarks, as though he had something
                     important to reveal, yet seemed doubtful whether it were better to make it
                     known than to treasure the secret. Confining himself to the subjects which he
                     knew were ever uppermost in Hans' thoughts, he soon succeeded in drawing the
                     miser into a very animated conversation, which, however, was rendered somewhat
                     uneasy by his mysterious demeanor. From some cause or other, perhaps because he
                     was thinking of the matter at the time, for he had thought of little else
                     during the entire day, Hans immediately surmised that his visitor sustained
                     some connexion with the singular letter he had received. This impression was
                     not only strengthened more and more by every word that fell from the stranger,
                     but his very dress, which gave him the appearance of a fashionable gentleman of
                     the preceding century, seemed to confirm it. When, however, his visitor
                     introduced the general carelessness of the world, a point upon which Hans had
                     always been well decided, and to which alone, he had<pb n="20-21"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000011"/> often said, was to be attributed all the poverty
                     in it, he became certain that his surmise was correct, and watched carefully
                     for something which might reveal the rich mine referred to in that mysterious
                     and treasured billet. When he had been worked into a state of uncontrollable
                     anxiety and excitement, the stranger, still preserving his mysterious air,
                     suddenly rose from, his seat, and rolling his eyes upwards in an agonized
                     manner, preceded by several terrible yawns, he rapidly repeated a few very
                     singular words, not found in Hans' vocabulary, if in any other. This had the
                     desired effect, for it so surprised and stupefied the poor Dutchman that the
                     stranger, in the increasing darkness, readily made his exit unobserved. After
                     the miser had somewhat recovered from the shock occasioned to his nerves and
                     ascertained that his visitor had vanished, it was clear to him that the
                     stranger could not have disappeared as he had entered, but must either have
                     sunk through the floor or ascended through the ceiling. Recollecting the
                     supplicating manner in which he had turned up his eyes, Hans quickly inferred
                     that the latter was the course he had taken, and under the exciting
                     circumstances of the occasion, it was not long before the inference became a
                     conviction which has ever since been most sacredly believed and maintained.</p>
                  <p>Now, Hans Dundermann, it should be known, had frequently held interesting
                     conversations with Heinrich Speitzer and Yorick Bozum, two of his most intimate
                     friends in "vaterland," and was perfectly satisfied that ghosts and spirits had
                     as real an existence as gold and silver, though their presence was far less
                     acceptable. He used to listen to the stories of these tried companions, and
                     tremble from head to foot when he was told how the wicked Frederick Metzel, on
                     a dark and dismal winter's night, had been claimed in pursuance of a contract,
                     attested by his own hand and seal, and carried off by the devil, amid great
                     lightning and thunder, to no one knew whither; for the place of his abode was
                     beyond the power of human discovery. It is true some of his warmest friends,
                     who had always been his companions, and enjoyed his favors during his
                     prosperity, and who had never neglected to sound his praises upon every fitting
                     occasion, now shook their heads significantly and solemnly whenever his name
                     was mentioned. This may have been intended as nothing but an exhibition of
                     their deep regret for what they had lost, yet the uncharitable soon interpreted
                     it unfavorably for the future of poor Frederick, whilst the more humane and
                     hopeful remained silent, simply because they knew what to say. Hans still
                     remembered how the spirit of old Herr Von Reicher, sorely troubled because he
                     had refused to reveal an important secret before his departure<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000012"/> ure from the lower world, returned to the home
                     six months previously left to mourn his death, and made known to the daughter
                     of his grand-child,—who had always been his favorite,—the cause that prevented
                     his rest. This was done by directing her to a dark and almost impenetrable
                     recess of his castle, where great treasures were concealed, which he had
                     hoarded up and frequently visited during his life. Now, however, that he had no
                     further occasion for such visits, his sense of justice, which had never in the
                     least troubled him whilst living, would not permit him to deprive his friends,
                     who had so carefully attended to his dying wants, of so valuable a secret, nor
                     his creditors of the only means through which their demands could be satisfied.
                     Nor had Hans Dundermann forgotten how the son of Karl Keiser, a pleasant
                     companion with whom he had spent many hours rehearsing wonderful tales, the
                     accuracy of which he never doubted, had been accosted in the rough woods, on a
                     dark October night, by a copper-colored man, out of the crown of whose head
                     issued a constant flame of fire, and led several leagues from home. What had
                     been the object of this singular and startling apparition—whether it had been
                     an evil spirit and intended the young man as one of its victims, or whether it
                     had merely meant to disclose some great and troublesome mystery—had to remain
                     undetermined termined, for day intervened and summoned the vision to its
                     abiding place. Many surmises were occasioned by this strange affair, vouched
                     for by the person himself whom it most concerned; but the majority agreed in
                     the opinion that no harm had been intended to the young man, otherwise the
                     spectre would not have waited until daylight to be deprived of its prey: others
                     expressed their conviction that it simply designed to relieve itself of some
                     serious trouble, whilst there was still a third class who pronounced the matter
                     all a foolish tale, which owed its origin to too much Rhienish wine and the
                     cold winds of October.</p>
                  <p>Whilst Hans was reflecting upon these marvelous stories of his youthful wonder,
                     and thus endeavoring to assist his mind in determining the character of his
                     late visitor, he gave evident signs of being engaged in a new employment.
                     Although he had heard many strange things in his time, and often threw up his
                     hands towards the skies, opened his mouth as wide as nature permitted, and
                     exclaimed "mein Gott!" in surprise, he certainly had never before been called
                     upon to decide whether any of his visions had been a ghost or a spirit, a witch
                     or the devil himself. In this troublesome dilemma he resolved to consult his
                     old housekeeper, whom he had brought with him from Germany, and whose greater
                     age and experience; he hoped, might be<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6407-00000013"/>
                     capable of relieving him from his perplexity. This indispensable article of his
                     household seemed to have descended to him with his father's estate, and
                     presented an appearance even more than ridiculously Dutch; but Hans had been
                     taught to regard her as a pattern of good taste, and as she had always
                     manifested the strongest devotion to his interests, he never doubted her
                     superior excellence. To give a faint description of her would be no trifling
                     labor, for she had apparently been worked together by nature without reference
                     to form or proportion; and whenever seen, was invariably covered with a
                     superfluous amount of greasy calico, which seemed to have no other support but
                     a twisted chord that encircled her extensive waist. Her head was remarkable for
                     nothing but a large quantity of light flaxen hair, to which the sun had failed
                     to give a ruddier tinge, although, as since her twentieth year she had scarcely
                     ever worn a covering, it had shone upon her pate fairly and with full effect
                     for more than thirty summers. Increasing age, though it had robbed her of her
                     teeth, put wrinkles in her face, and somewhat loosened her joints, seemed to be
                     equally powerless to make the least visible impression upon it. The singular
                     conduct of the stranger, who had been observed but casually by the old woman as
                     he had entered, was fully considered and commented upon by her and Hans. Though
                     she sympathized with him as much as her nature permitted, and gave ample
                     evidence of her desire to render him all possible assistance, she could offer
                     no suggestions which tended in the least to solve the mystery. Her many
                     exclamations, however, if useless in the explication of a mysterious and
                     difficult problem, brought some relief; and thus consoled, he reluctantly
                     concluded to await the full development of what he believed had just fairly
                     commenced with the letter he had received and the visit of the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"Whatever this may forebode," said Hans, "it is so very strange that we must
                     wait until the end shall come; yet I hope that my end may not be like that of
                     Frederick Metzel. Let me be spared the terrors that fell to the lot of Karl
                     Keiser's son, and if the worst should come, let it be no worse than that which
                     happened to the great-grand-daughter of Herr Von Reicher."</p>
                  <p>These remarkable occurrences, constituting some of the most startling he had
                     stored up in his memory, had been so repeatedly told to his housekeeper, with
                     great embellishments, that she had become perfectly familiar with them.
                     Although Hans did not much like to have dealings with spirits; yet, had he been
                     certain that the mysterious stranger would never afterwards have troubled him,
                     he would gladly have entertained him once more, if assured of a revelation
                     similar to that made to the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6407-00000014"/> youthful
                     daughter of Herr Von Reicher's grandchild.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," responded the old woman, whose frame trembled violently at the
                     supposition that calamities so terrible could possibly befall them, "heaven
                     avert such fatalities! Surely, Hans, nothing of this kind can happen to us, for
                     you have never had any intercourse with the evil one, nor have you ever been
                     closely allied to any of those poor creatures whose spirits are not even
                     permitted to rest quietly in their graves."</p>
                  <p>As he had thus, for several days been moved by strange thoughts, it was
                     observed by those whom he happened to meet that a very singular change had
                     suddenly come over him. His actions seemed to be dictated by a variety of
                     conflicting impulses, and the little mind he had once possessed was absent more
                     than half the time. He would make long pauses in his conversation, abruptly
                     change from one topic to another, and occasionally, to the great amazement of
                     those with whom he conversed, he would walk off before he had half completed a
                     sentence. Then, too, he was frequently seen to stop in his solitary walks and
                     engage in earnest conversation with himself, a smile sometimes animating his
                     countenance, whilst at others he appeared very sullen and dejected. On several
                     of these occasions he was overheard to speak audibly of spirits and treasures,
                     which so greatly surprised all who heard him that some even suggested an
                     investigation into his soundness of mind. To those acquainted with the design
                     to play upon his stupid and credulous nature, it was daily becoming more
                     apparent that he believed vast quantities of gold were somewhere concealed in
                     the vicinity, and that he was troubled to know where, and how he could secure
                     them. At length his changed demeanor became the subject of remark throughout
                     the entire neighborhood. Some of the villagers, in their efforts to account for
                     it, expressed the belief that his heart was beginning to soften and that he was
                     relenting of his former penuriousness—a reformation which, in his case, it was
                     generally conceded would have been sufficient to account for his singular
                     conduct. Others, however, more strenuously maintained, that so far from his
                     heart undergoing so favorable a change, it was simply passing through the last
                     stages of ossification. That the former were mistaken in their charitable
                     surmises, was soon ascertained by an experiment eminently calculated to arouse
                     his generosity; but there are those still amongst the latter, who contend that
                     they were correct in their opinion, and are determined to obtain positive
                     evidence of the fact, upon the miser's decease, through the aid of an
                     anatomist, who has already been duly engaged for that purpose.</p>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6407-00000015"/>
                  <p>When it was supposed that Hans was exclusively abstracted in the train of
                     reflections suggested to his mind by the circumstances related, it was deemed
                     expedient for the stranger to venture another visit, which he accordingly did.
                     It so happened that he obtained admission unobserved into the same room in
                     which he had before met Hans, and giving seven distinct raps on the old oaken
                     floor, he was soon brought into the presence of the miser. After the latter's
                     surprise had partially subsided, and his face assumed something like its
                     original hue, the stranger commenced addressing him in a manner equally hasty
                     and incoherent, but Hans was all attention as if determined to absorb the
                     import of every word as it was uttered. He by no means comprehended all that
                     was said, yet he distinctly understood the request of his visitor to meet him
                     that night, at the hour of twelve, at the edge of the wood bordering on the
                     western extremity of the village, where the important secret was to be
                     revealed. The stranger had scarcely finished this request, when he was seized
                     with a violent cough, resulting from a stream of munched tobacco which had
                     unforbidden entered down his gullet, as if offended at being imprisoned within
                     his mouth whilst personating a character whose dignity would not permit him to
                     eject it. Giving vent to an almost inaudible curse, which was unfortunately
                     mistaken taken for a call for water, Hans immediately seized a pitcher, and
                     hurried out of the room, informing the old housekeeper, as he was in the act of
                     passing her in the kitchen, of the presence of the spirit. Upon her reminding
                     him that spirits were never in want of such earthly necessaries, surprised at
                     his own absence of thought, he dropped the pitcher and quickly returned; but
                     the stranger, no doubt glad of so favorable an opportunity, had
                     disappeared.</p>
                  <p>Hans Dundermann, at the earnest entreaty of his old housekeeper, whom I shall
                     here name Malchen, not because she was so christened, but simply out of
                     solicitude for the jaw-bones of those who might attempt to pronounce her
                     ponderous title were it fully given, retired to his bed at an early hour that
                     evening. It has already been stated that he desired no intimacy with spirits,
                     and especialy with such as disappeared so unexpectedly; but his endeavors to
                     banish from his mind the request of the stranger were unavailing, and the
                     tempting promise which accompanied it would not permit him to close his eyes in
                     sleep. Impelled by an irresistible anxiety to secure the imagined treasure, he
                     arose from his bed, and walked up and down the room in great agitation until
                     within a few minutes of midnight. His love of gold, however, at last succeeded
                     in conquering his fears, so, seizing a German bible, which had<pb n="30-31"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000016"/> evidently grown antiquated by neglect amid dust
                     and cobwebs, and cautiously placing it in his capacious pocket, for he had
                     often heard that whilst he had so good a book about his person no evil spirit
                     could harm him, he repaired to the appointed spot. Here he had for some time
                     been intently peering into the dark wood, when suddenly he heard a strange
                     noise behind him, and upon turning he obtained a full view of the stranger, who
                     had taken the precaution to provide against the prevailing darkness by a
                     lantern, the red rays of which only gave to everything around a more gloomy
                     appearance. Hans involuntarily startled and most heartily wished himself in his
                     bed again, but it was now too late. Grazing supplicatingly into the pale face
                     of the spirit, for he was fully persuaded that he stood in the presence of a
                     veritable spirit, he commenced imploringly inquiring about his personal safety
                     and the prospect of securing the treasure. His appeal, however, failed to draw
                     a word of consolation or encouragement from his supernatural companion who
                     simply indicated by a sign that silence had to be observed, and pointing into
                     the uninviting wood signified to him to move on. Tremblingly the miser
                     proceeded, frequently staring wildly around. Whether it was all imagination, or
                     a fancy which had some substance for its basis, he certainly thought, upon
                     passing several large trees, he saw odd figures behind them. However this may
                     have been, a death-like silence was maintained, nor did Hans seem inclined to
                     break it after his first rebuff. At length they arrived at a small old
                     building, which, though it was not many miles from his residence, he had never
                     before seen. All now surrounding him was dark and strange, and he gazed upon
                     the structure with mingled emotions the like of which he had never before
                     experienced. Whilst endeavoring to collect his wandering wits during this
                     momentary halt at the antiquated building, an unearthly howl was suddenly set
                     up around it, which so frightened him that he at once attempted to test what
                     virtue there was in his heels. Alas! poor Hans! His knees knocked together and
                     his frame shook so violently, he could not move. He was as much a prisoner to
                     his terror as the chained criminal in his cell. It was now that the solicitous
                     advice of his faithful Malchen came rushing upon his memory, and he deplored
                     the folly which had caused him to disobey it. His regrets however, it is
                     believed, were more owing to the wealth he had left behind him than to his
                     having disregarded her good advice, for he began to apprehend that he should
                     never see it more. During this interval of his great consternation, the spirit
                     had remained perfectly calm and composed; and after the noise had entirely
                     subsided it again exhorted him to silence, and softly whispered<pb n="32-33"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000017"/> into his ears that the place was surrounded and
                     protected by numerous imps of the devil who had been commissioned to guard the
                     treasure. Though many before Hans' time may have been in equally close contact
                     with some of Satan's extensive brood and felt no fear, and although he had
                     spent nearly all his days in executing to their master an indisputable title to
                     himself, he found no consolation in what the spirit had told him. If he was
                     inclined to render service to Lucifer he preferred doing so at a more
                     convenient distance from him.</p>
                  <p>Without any visible intervention of the spirit, at least such is the testimony
                     of Hans Dundermann, an opening into the cellar of the building now appeared.
                     Here he was bidden to enter, which he did more through fear than inclination,
                     attended by his mysterious guide. The red glare reflected by the lantern, gave
                     the place a very solemn and haunted appearance, and made the old walls resemble
                     more the neglected ruins of some venerable edifice, than what they purported to
                     be. They had evidently been built when masonic skill was in its infancy and
                     when huge, substantial clumsiness was the fashion. He surveyed the cavern, for
                     such it appeared to him, with wild respect, confident that this had once been
                     the retreat of the Englishman whose memory had so long been perpetuated in the
                     traditions of the village. What was next to befall him, now that he was
                     entirely at the mercy and in the power of the spirit, he could not divine. He
                     was carefully watching its movements as it walked around the cellar, cautiously
                     treading the damp ground, until it came to a stand, and beckoned him to
                     approach. Here, then, he ascertained, was hidden the treasure which had so much
                     engrossed his attention, and caused him so many perplexing thoughts. His fears
                     now yielded to the first flushes occasioned by the almost certain assurance of
                     securing the hoarded gold. Thus animated by the promising prospect before him,
                     his recent regrets were entirely forgotten, and he felt pleased and proud that
                     he had left his bed for so bold and profitable an adventure. His anxious
                     anticipations, however, were not to be so easily gratified as he had at first
                     imagined. The wealth he coveted was still a considerable distance under ground,
                     but this, to him, appeared but a trifling obstacle. He had often handled the
                     pick and spade for a paltry price per diem; and now, that a great reward was to
                     be the issue, he could use them to advantage. The requisite utensils were soon
                     supplied by the spirit, and Hans squandered no time in commencing vigorous
                     operations. Though a veritable Dutchman, he entirely lost the Dutchman's
                     slowness upon this memorable occasion. He relied more upon energetic effort for
                     success than upon tedious perseverance and plodding patience, and the soft
                        earth<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6407-00000018"/> was made to fly in every
                     direction. The excitement of the employment soon brought back his usual
                     complexion, and gave his plump face a greasy and shining appearance; when off
                     went hat and coat, and every other article of apparel which generally encumbers
                     a Dutchman whilst at labor. He was now too intently engaged to pay any
                     attention to the spirit, which made its exit from the cellar unnoticed and
                     unheeded.</p>
                  <p>For some time all continued quiet, not a sound being heard beyond the noise
                     occasioned by himself. He was making rapid progress and congratulating himself
                     upon soon reaching the expected bounty, when his pleasant reflections were
                     suddenly disturbed by another terrible and unearthly howl, much resembling that
                     which had before so greatly excited his fears. In its hollow re-echoes through
                     the cellar it was rendered even more terrific. The spade dropped from his hand,
                     and turning round in his bewilderment, he now first discovered that the spirit
                     had abandoned him. Although he had previously most heartily desired it to leave
                     him and permit him to find his way home again, he now regarded its
                     disappearance as ominous of ill. Alone, with nothing but a credulous and
                     excited imagination for his guide, he was made the victim of a thousand
                     unpleasant impulses, and realized all the dread horrors of unrestrained fear.
                     His face became deathly pale and big drops of cold perspiration stood upon it,
                     whilst his hair rose on end and his eyes dilated and literally sparkled. For a
                     time, as he stood the impersonation of terror, he was unable to comprehend his
                     position, but with returning reason he applied himself to diligent search for
                     the opening through which he had entered. Every nook and corner was quickly
                     examined, but no means of escape were discoverable. Although that awful howl
                     subsided almost simultaneously with his dropping of the spade, he could not
                     approach the spot where he had been digging for the treasure without hearing it
                     again. Had not the spirit told him that the place was guarded by the imps of
                     the devil, and how could he be expected to withstand them? Had not Frederick
                     Metzel been carried off, notwithstanding his resistance, and never heard of
                     more? Oh, Malchen, this for neglecting your anxious and wholesome advice! All
                     these reflections, and ten thousand others no more comforting in their nature,
                     passed rapidly through his mind. The thoughts of a life-time were now crowded
                     into a few of his minutes, and a volume could not give a faithful transcript of
                     the many marvelous stories that spontaneously rushed through his brain. When
                     the devil seemed determined to prevent Luther from prosecuting his work, the
                     Reformer seized an inkstand and hurled it at his head. Though the missile<pb
                        n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6407-00000019"/> had little effect upon the object at
                     which it was aimed, being simply dashed to pieces against the wall, upon which
                     the black marks are said still to remain, the tormentor nevertheless vanished.
                     Hans could not deal thus summarily with the great adversary, who happened to
                     have no small claim upon his miserly soul, ready for settlement at any moment.
                     Debtors, and especially those indebted to Satan, are obliged to be more
                     courteous. He was therefore compelled to yield to an influence which his more
                     devotional countryman had only overcome with great difficulty. All ideas of
                     obtaining the treasure were accordingly abandoned, and imprisoned as he was,
                     his first great care was to effect his release. How this was to be accomplished
                     he knew not, as he more slowly and carefully re-examined the old walls, with
                     lantern in hand, escaping only the place where he had so faithfully dug for the
                     hidden wealth. That he could not think of approaching, for he now distinctly
                     and unmistakeably saw a half grown imp seated upon the fresh earth he had
                     thrown up, who was eyeing him in no very complacent manner. Hans has since
                     described him as the very image of a picture in one of his German books, which
                     he had often contemplated with feelings of melancholy dread, and which had
                     equally often puzzled his brain by the thoughts invariably suggested to his
                     mind whenever he beheld it. He never could divine the real policy of tolerating
                     the existence of such hideous monsters; and, perhaps more influenced by
                     personal considerations than feelings of charity for mankind in general, he had
                     frequently most heartily wished their utter extermination and the total
                     annihilation of their constantly increasing kingdom. The puny devil before
                     Hans' eyes was undoubtedly a legitimate offshoot of the parent stock. He had a
                     large two-pronged fork in his right hand, and in his left he held one end of a
                     strong chain, whilst the other was fastened to his body, so that its great bulk
                     had to trail upon the ground. His long tail, pointed like an arrow, and erected
                     several feet above his head, appeared even more formidable than the fork. His
                     posture much resembled that of an old man, seated upon a low stool, his stiff
                     legs drawn up towards his body. He was almost entirely covered with rough,
                     brown hair, and the bristles upon his head pointed in every direction. There
                     was a fiery glitter in his eyes, and the expression of his countenance,
                     according to Hans' description, could be handsomely counterfeited by
                     compounding together the faces of a grinning monkey and a fat Dutchman.</p>
                  <p>At last, fortunately, Hans Dundermann thought he discovered a prospect of
                     delivery from his torments. Not possessing the magic power of the spiritual
                     guide that<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6407-00000020"/> had led him into this
                     horrible prison, the walls could not be expected to part at his simple bidding,
                     and he therefore wisely determined to test the virtue of more natural means.
                     Seizing the spade, he made a number of vigorous thrusts against the substantial
                     masonry, which, though it resisted his efforts for a considerable time, was
                     eventually compelled to yield him a passage, through which he could escape.
                     Thanks! he was now once more in the open air and breathed again! The devils set
                     up another howl, as if in exultation, and several seemed to be slyly
                     approaching him; but Hans, relying upon his nether limbs, which appeared to
                     have derived strength for the occasion, hurried off with remarkable rapidity.
                     Not content, however, with having prevented him from obtaining the treasure,
                     the whole pack of imps now followed close upon his heels, crying his name at
                     the top of their voices, but this only increased his speed the more. No
                     obstacle seemed a hindrance to him. Dark as it was, he scaled the rocks, and
                     stones, and stumps, in his leaps, as on he flew, leaving those in pursuit far
                     behind. There was no manifestation of the tardy Dutchman in that chase, as he
                     pursued his course for miles, not knowing whither it led and feeling little
                     inclination to pause and consider. When, at last, he came to a stand, lo! the
                     veritable spirit which had enticed him into the wood stood, at his side and was
                     calmly gazing upon him. Hans shut his eyes, but it was still there. Drawing in
                     his breath, he bolted in another direction with a speed that outdistanced even
                     this supernatural vision, but led him far from his home. Hatless, and coatless,
                     he eventually seated himself upon the earth, determined to await the approach
                     of day. Though he knew not in what locality he was, nor how, lost in the wood,
                     he should find the village again, he was yet consoled by the reflection that he
                     was free from the clutches of satan and his imps. The terrors of Karl Keiser's
                     son had been nothing in comparison to those he had endured.</p>
                  <p>When morning dawned,—and never had Hans Dundermann more welcomed the approach
                     of day,—he be took himself to the difficult task of searching for his home. His
                     venerable housekeeper had been thrown into great consternation upon discovering
                     his absence. Not knowing whither he had gone, or what had become of him, her
                     fears at once made her conclude that he had shared the sad fate of Frederick
                     Metzel, and been carried off by the spirit during the night, as a terrible
                     punishment for having neglected to meet it as he had been requested. She now
                     reproached herself for having obtruded her advice upon him, but to make amends,
                     she told the matter to her neighbors, and search was immediately commenced for
                     the lost. He was not discovered<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6407-00000021"/> until
                     the succeeding day, and when brought to his dence to the great delight of
                     Malchen, gave a narration of his adventures which alike astonished the
                     credulous and amused the doubting.</p>
                  <p>Those who heard it at once determined to investigate the matter, and, if
                     possible, obtain the treasure and make a general distribution of it amongst
                     themselves. Hans now had the entire neighborhood at his heels, many fully
                     believing his entire tale and looking anxiously for a portion of the spoils;
                     others following from sheer impulse, not knowing what to think or say; whilst
                     others still were led on by curiosity to see the end of what they simply
                     believed to be a foolish vagary of a distempered brain. He was but a sorry
                     guide, however, and after vainly searching for the old building to which he had
                     been led by the spirit, he gave it as his settled conviction that the imps must
                     have removed it, leaving no trace behind that it had once existed, lest they
                     might experience too much difficulty in preserving the wealth it contained. The
                     conclusion was a wise one, and if it taught nothing more, it at least
                     illustrated the remark of a learned Genoese, that "miser's worship no God but
                     money, and will deny even the very faith they profess rather than fail in
                     schemes to augment their treasures." However faithful servants of satan they
                     may be, he knows that they would betray even him to gratify their desire, and
                     understands them too well not to place his possessions beyond their wily
                     clutches, in which he is certainly more judicious than many mortals.</p>

                  <p>THE succeeding essay was read before the Association, and appears, from the
                     following prefatory remarks, to have been the production of one of its
                     committees.—EDITOR.</p>
                  <p>"Your committee, simply from the want of a new theme, have been compelled, even
                     at the hazard of proving tedious, to confine themselves to an old one. The many
                     extravagancies daily exhibited by those around us might perhaps afford more
                     matter for ridicule than admonition, but few are willing that their follies
                     should be made the means of amusing others, Whilst none will object to a little
                     kind advice, though he be determined not to heed it. We therefore concluded
                     that the latter mode of treating our subject, if the most stupid, would still
                     possess the merit of being the least annoying. Then, too, stupidity having
                     become a common quality, in which each is privileged to deal, a sacred right
                     not to be denied without closing the mouths of more than nine-tenths of the
                     world, our dullness can be no trespass and consequently needs no apology."</p>

                  <p>IN the extended range of our wishes and their diversified character, the
                     reflective man will recognise one of the greatest sources of human misery. The
                     many desires which impel us affect alike the mind and heart, frequently
                     disturbing the healthy repose of the one, and rendering the other cold and
                     selfish. The illusory nature of life and its schemes, and the changing
                     influences which ever surround us, seldom permit us to attain the most moderate
                     aspirations of our youth. Through the lively impetus constantly given to the
                     imagination during that period of life, we are prone to devise certain plans
                     and arrange magnificent schemes to accomplish our desires; yet the weight of
                     years steals upon us gradually, until we look upon the past but as a<pb
                        n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6407-00000024"/> long chain of circumstances, and our
                     present life and condition as its result. One by one our determinations,
                     however long and fervently cherished, pass away unrealized; whilst our sanguine
                     wishes, with their ardor perhaps somewhat abated through the influence of
                     experience and the cool meditations of riper age, still remain ungratified. He
                     who had contrived and contemplated schemes to amass wealth, and then retire to
                     repose amid the comforts and luxuries of the world, may linger out a life of
                     toil and poverty in some humble hamlet; he who had longed to ascend the steeps
                     of science and gather in abundance its noble treasures, may feel the
                     admonishing wrinkles upon his brow even before he has made one permanent
                     acquisition; and he who had encouraged dreams of ambition, and courted the
                     uncertain plaudits of fame, may die at last forgotten and unknown.</p>
                  <p>Moderation in our wishes is as rarely witnessed as their realization. It was an
                     argument with the Cynics that absence of all want was the natural condition of
                     the Gods, and therefore he who stood in need of but few things most resembled
                     them. The remark ascribed to Taxilles is admirable and philosophic, "What
                     occasion is there, Alexander, that you and I must needs quarrel and fight;
                     since you neither came to rob us of our water nor of our food, which are the
                     only two things that men in their wits think worth contending for?" The idea of
                     the Cynics is rarely exemplified in human life, and the moderate desires
                     expressed by Taxilles equally seldom infuse into men the modest wishes they
                     suggest to our minds. St. Cyprian, and others before and after him, distributed
                     their possessions amongst their fellows, reducing themselves to poverty. If all
                     cannot admire the wisdom of their action, certainly none can find anything in
                     their motives to condemn. They who have thus mastered their selfishness and
                     avarice, two vices sufficiently powerful to destroy many of the nobler virtues,
                     have obtained a command over themselves more desirable than wealth or
                     distinction. They have conquered impulses whose end not unfrequently is agony
                     of mind and destruction to all the sensibilities of the soul; they have
                     subjected their wishes and tamed their desires to encounter the vicissitudes of
                     life with philosophic calmness.</p>
                  <p>The present pleasure may pass away into oblivion, or it may leave a permanent
                     sting behind; and yet it is for this that extravagant wishes leap into being
                     and expand to the limit of possibility, or to the extent of our comprehension.
                     The diviner philosophy which teaches us the vanity of our desires, and the
                     vexation of spirit attending even their full gratification, is neglected until
                     forced upon us by the irresistable teachings of experience.<pb n="48-49"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000025"/> The most excellent lessons of virtue are treated
                     with Indifference to further imposing schemes for riches, for fame, or for
                     power; yet the one is not attended by peace of mind, the other brings no quiet
                     comfort to the soul, and the third fails to realize happiness and contentment.
                     The flatteries of friends and sycophants which follow you in each, only fill
                     your face with frowns and your heart with loathing and disgust. The wealth of
                     Crassus, the Rich, brought him neither contentment nor protection; the
                     distinction of Pompey could not brook the rising glory of his great rival, and
                     but provoked his malice and his envy; the power of Csar only increased his
                     ambition, which continued to prey upon his soul and in his longings for the
                     crown it became his own avenger; and the flatterers of Canute but made him feel
                     his insignificance and aroused his contempt.</p>
                  <p>The wish for distinction and renown, however, may not only be blameless in
                     itself, but when restrained within proper bounds, highly honorable. There is a
                     medium between ambition and a total neglect of reputation as hard distinctly to
                     define as it is difficult to practice. Few have known how to follow it, and
                     many whose wishes were at first confined to the rule of a town, afterwards
                     aspired to empire. History even refuses to agree with Cicero in according to
                     Csar the credit of having, at the beginning of his career, devised and pursued
                     a definite plan to subvert the Roman Common-wealth and elevate himself to the
                     tyranny. None would add to the infamy of Marius or Sylla by supposing that the
                     first aspirations of either were for absolute power. When it is remembered how
                     difficult it is to be restrained within this medium, it will not appear strange
                     that so many should have overstepped it, often to the great injury of
                     themselves and more frequently still to the great affliction of the people. If
                     our wishes be prompted by motives to promote the public good, they may justly
                     acquire the title of patriotism; and when, in addition, they are so wholly
                     under our control as to enable us to assume the command to-day and renounce it
                     to-morrow should the interests of the country require it, we are eminently
                     qualified for every sphere or position in the Republic. Frederick, the Elector
                     of Saxony, refused the crown under the impression that an Emperor more powerful
                     than himself was needed to preserve Germany; and the humble Cincinnatus found
                     more repose and pleasure in the cultivation of his little fields than in the
                     exercise of power or the trappings of wealth. Unlike the treacherous decemviri,
                     when the duties of his high positions had been performed, he meekly resigned
                     them again to seek the approving smiles of his Attillia and the content of his
                     humble home. These are examples with which history does not abound, and
                        whatever<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6407-00000026"/> credit we may accord to
                     their deeds of worth and valor, we yet see more to admire in their generous
                     humility and the noble command they constantly reserved over themselves.</p>
                  <p>It is a small matter to wish for virtue, yet a more worthy desire never entered
                     the mind of man. Virtue is the highest of all treasures, and however rarely it
                     may be seen, is neither beyond the reach of any nor above his comprehension.
                     The high and low, the prince and the peasant, are alike possessed with the
                     power of attaining it. All the greater excellencies of nature are free and
                     within universal reach. It is the remark of an old philosopher, that "many
                     people, without having their reason improved by study, live nevertheless in a
                     manner conformable to the dictates of right reason;" and Montagne observes that
                     the life of the peasant is frequently more agreeable to philosophy than that of
                     the philosopher himself. This wish is none the less ennobling because its
                     answer is within universal reach. It is even more rarely realized than desires
                     for wealth or power, and is infinitely preferable to either when attained.
                     There is nothing in nature more useful, for what evils does it not avert? It
                     renders us impregnable to the stealthy encroachments of vice; relieves us of
                     all selfishness, guile, and hypocrisy; robs us of all malice, deceit, and
                     treachery; frees us from the gnawings of envy, the miseries of hate, and the
                     slavery of passion; delivers us from the bondage of avarice, ambition, and the
                     remorse which so frequently attends them; and fits us not only to think of but
                     to do "whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever
                     things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,
                     whatsoever things are of good report." It is no less permanent than it is
                     useful. We scarcely know which most to admire, the cool indifference of
                     Phalereus, or the tribute which he pays to the durable nature of virtue, in his
                     reply, when told that the Athenian people had thrown down and destroyed his
                     statues: "Well, but they cannot overturn that virtue for the sake of which they
                     were crected." It is a noble companion for every sphere of life, teaching us
                     how to wear, with just humility, the honors we may acquire, and how to submit,
                     with becoming dignity, to the reverses of fortune, the treachery of friends,
                     and the persecution of enemies. Under its guidance, the world is seen in its
                     true character, and our duties towards it discharged with forbearance and
                     charity. Without it, none can be truly great nor truly happy. With it, all may
                     obtain a just share of human happiness and contentment, and each secure for
                     himself the noble tribute which history has paid to Epaminondas, a higher<pb

                     through the realization of the grandest schemes for wealth or glory: "HE WAS A
                     MAN ADORNED WITH EVERY VIRTUE, AND STAINED BY NO VICE."</p>

                     has attempted to detail, merely designed to attract attention to a rich
                     resource of pleasure inherent in every good man. To him who has carefully kept
                     himself free from dishonor, and whose life has never been marred by the stains

                     mind, a great reward." He who has so lived as to obtain it, whatever his

                  <head>THE SICK MOTHER.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE never sat by the sick-bed of a mother without finding gradually stealing
                     over me a deeply melancholy and impressive feeling. Nature has so constituted
                     the human mind as to render it susceptible of an infinite variety of emotions,
                     and made it so expansive in its grasp as to enable it to contemplate everything
                     within the boundless universe. However finite it may be, there is nothing of
                     which it cannot think; and although there are many things which it fails to
                     understand, they all inspire some feeling or awaken some emotion within the
                     invisible recesses of our nature. The many truths of which we know, and the
                     countless beauties mirrored before our eyes by the imagination dwelling upon
                     uncertainties and doubtful probabilities, often give rise to a variety of
                     sensations so powerful as to hold us spellbound. The deep springs of the heart,
                     frequently hidden to our comprehension, are ever flowing for our enjoyment. Of
                     this I was recently reminded, in a very<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6407-00000029"
                     /> impressive manner, by being ushered into the presence of a mother, who had,
                     for three successive years, been confined to a sick-bed. The information of her
                     sore affliction suggested a train of thought, and prompted a number of
                     reflections, the recollection of which will forever abide fresh in my memory.
                     She was yet young, and notwithstanding her many trials, exhibited a vigor of
                     mind and a freshness of heart seldom discovered in the most healthy and
                     buoyant. The knowledge of her prostration for years, in the prime of her life,
                     and when possessed of all the impulsive desires and sanguine expectations
                     common to those of her age, saddened me to sickness as I first entered her
                     apartment; but upon discovering her genuine animation, her beauty of heart and
                     sprightliness of mind, my feelings alternately changed from sadness to
                     surprise, from surprise to veneration. How many pleasures, thought I, had I
                     enjoyed during the past three years! How had I, watching the changing seasons,
                     relished the many delightful things each of them had brought forth! In the
                     mellow sunlight of the morning, I had drank in the beauties of the earth; and
                     in the sweet twilight of the evening, I had reaped the richest bounties it
                     afforded. I had daily sported with my friends, many of whom had never felt a
                     wish unanswered, yet still remained unsatisfied; I had played alike with the
                     young and old with an intensity of interest rest that touched every chord of
                     the heart; and I had felt the ecstacy of a variety of joys, whilst the vigor of
                     uninterrupted health but spread out before me all that heart could wish, or
                     soul desire. There were our glorious winter parties, where kindness,
                     friendship, and love, ministered to our wishes; gleeful rides over the silvery
                     snow, cozily muffled in furs, and almost buried in robes, our exuberant
                     hilarity rising high above the jingling music of the bells; summer meetings
                     beneath the shady branches of the willow, in the downy meadow; and moonlight
                     strolls with cherished companions all around us, and loved ones leaning
                     tenderly on our arms. We had our social enjoyments in all their diversified
                     characters; our many exhibitions of the noblest intellect fraught with the
                     golden treasures of study; our seasonable round of vivifying concerts by the
                     highest talent in the wide world; our splendid and attractive operas, with all
                     the more and less refined amusements which the age required to make up the sum
                     total of this never satisfied and insatiable human life, Whether in door or
                     out, we found all that could be desired to make existence pleasing, and attach
                     us the more firmly to it; yet here was one who had none, or few of these
                     things. Chained down within the narrow compass of her bed, her ill destiny had
                     denied to her the pleasures of the world without. How could she endure it?
                     Would not<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6407-00000030"/> her heart wither for want of
                     food, and her mind perish for lack of stimulants? Nothing in the least
                     approaching to this was perceptible. She ever seemed the happy spirit that
                     could rise above the afflictions of fate, and over which no misfortune could
                     cast a cloud of despair.</p>
                  <p>In conversation, she spoke of the world with a knowledge and a heart that would
                     have persuaded you she constantly moved with the busiest portion of it. She was
                     fully aware of the condition and employments of her friends, enjoying their
                     sports and amusements as much, apparently, as though she was participating in
                     them; and often, with her own delicate hands, she had prepared some trifling
                     and expressive thing, which told how much she wished their happiness. There was
                     no complaint in her, nor could you force repining regrets upon her. Her answers
                     to your queries were always the same in sweetness and resignation, and such as
                     might almost have led you to think she preferred her condition to one of
                     health, and its attendant pleasures. It is true, she did not conceal that, at
                     first, her situation seemed indeed terrible to herself, yet principally from
                     one cause, which never ceased more or less to trouble her. She had a young and
                     devoted husband, and she regretted more for his sake than her own, her
                     incapacity to mingle in the social spheres of life, and thus afford him
                     enjoyments which were denied him in her condition. Her selfishness, if she ever
                     had any, was changed from herself and directed towards him, upon whom she would
                     have conferred every merit or good quality she possessed, had she had the
                     power, and many more, if possible, and regarded the task the most delightful
                     she had ever performed. His very desires and aims of life had become her's, and
                     I believe she would have suffered any personal inconvenience or sacrifice to
                     have gratified him in them all; his troubles and vexations, by some strange and
                     inexplicable influence of sympathy, she had invariably succeeded in removing
                     from his mind, and placing in their stead a new and more exalted vigor: in
                     truth, he had never felt a regret, a pang, a trial, however trifling, in which
                     she had not participated, and which, by some mysterious balm distilled by her
                     own sympathetic heart, she had not contributed to remove or obliterate. If,
                     however, she shared so much in his sorrows, she partook none the less of his
                     joys. His happiness was her own; his successes and his triumphs were her's; and
                     the just rewards of his ceaseless labors, deservedly elevating him in public
                     esteem, were even more gratifying to her than to himself. In his honorable
                     elevation, she beheld her personal advancement, and in the brightness of his
                     reputation, she felt additions to her own. When his aspirations had been
                     realized, she had experienced a gratification superior to his, and when he had
                     attained a<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6407-00000031"/> point through assiduous
                     effort, the acquisition afforded mutual pleasure. Thus entering into his very
                     existence, she deplored her affliction more from a desire to promote his
                     happiness than from any wish or anxiety for personal gratification and
                     enjoyment.</p>
                  <p>The apartment occupied by her was neatly fitted up and arranged with a view of
                     making her situation as comfortable as possible, and evidences were not wanting
                     of the generous sympathies of her friends. Whatever was supposed capable of
                     affording her a moment's cheerful amusement, or of lessening the tedium of her
                     constant confinement, was supplied; and the innumerable attentions bestowed
                     upon her bore ample testimony of the esteem in which she was held. Her
                     acquaintances seemed really to be vieing with each other who could do most to
                     attest the good wishes entertained in her behalf, and the many expedients
                     invented to gratify her, well exhibited the magnanimous ingenuity and skill of
                     their authors. How highly did she appreciate this kindness, and how
                     enthusiastically did she speak of it! To hear her, was to forget her
                     afflictions, and partake of her grateful and joyous feelings. She had often
                     exclaimed, in the fullness of her heart, that she could wish for no more; and
                     indeed, turn where you would, you could see nothing but tokens of sympathy and
                     love, which the stricken soul alone can fully know how to cherish. Then, too,
                     she had a little bright-eyed, prattling boy, the best and happiest in the
                     world, she would say. With him she would play for hours together, and pet him
                     with tender caresses, attesting the power of her motherly affections, and
                     evincing how much she treasured him. In his gleeful gambols, she would watch
                     him with ineffable fondness, and his infantile freaks elicited emotions which
                     she would not have bartered for the world. Next to her husband, her boy was her
                     greatest earthly idol, and a stay which, though tender, made life, however
                     afflicted, a boon that filled her heart with gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Whilst seated in her apartment, in conversation with her, her husband, with
                     whom I had spent many of my youthful days, and once taken a long excursion
                     through several provinces, entered, without observing me, and, walking to the
                     bedside of his wife, he tenderly embraced her, and then sat silently down
                     before her. I fancied I saw a tear glistening in his eye, and I never was more
                     moved to pity. How much I had been mistaken, and how misdirected had been my
                     compassion, I was pleased to ascertain soon after. As I was upon the point of
                     addressing him, she cast a look upon him so sweetly soft and gentle, that, once
                     seen, it could never be forgotten, and smilingly said,</p>
                  <p>"Come, Charles, be more cheerful and communicative. Let me know what has been
                     astir within the past few<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6407-00000032"/> hours since
                     your return. You certainly do not appear to be displeased, and yet you are not
                     disposed to be talkative."</p>
                  <p>"Nothing has in the least ruffled my temper, I assure you. I am as well
                     contented with myself and the world now as ever, and would not so belie the
                     home of my friend as to cause a supposition that my visit to him had rendered
                     me dull and gloomy."</p>
                  <p>"What, then, makes you so silent? I have noticed your quiet moments, at times,
                     heretofore, without being able to divine their cause, and you have never been
                     pleased to make it known."</p>
                  <p>"That was because I thought your own heart knew it, and felt it: but as I am in
                     the mood, I shall endeavor to tell you. You are well aware that there are
                     periods when the heart speaks more in silence than the tongue could possibly
                     express—when a momentary pause reveals more than the talk of a day could
                     unfold. I know you have sometimes found your feelings too powerful for
                     utterance, and in silent thought permitted them partially to subside before you
                     ventured to speak and break the spell that enchained you. Nature has so
                     constituted those capable of genuine love, that, whilst feeling the influence
                     of so sacred an affection, their ecstacy should not be disturbed even by the
                     pleasures of conversation. The strength of this passion, at times, overpowers
                     every other impulse; and though it may then enforce silence, it only does so to
                     enable us to enjoy the more the rich treasures of our own hearts. Depend upon
                     it, such moments wear the touches of angels, and furnish us with the sublimest
                     idea of the enjoyments of heaven that can be realized in the present life.
                     Their recurrence cannot come too often, nor can they be retained too long, when
                     present, for they are our choicest blessings."</p>
                  <p>If ever, thought I, a wife had been answered to her heart's full satisfaction,
                     this sick and helpless one was in the present instance. It was now her turn to
                     become silent, and changing her position, I obtained a full view of her
                     animated countenance, from which I inferred that the words of her husband had
                     penetrated into her soul to be secretly treasured there. My position had
                     already become too embarrassing to allow me to remain silent any longer; so,
                     rising from my seat, I advanced towards him, and was about offering an apology,
                     but he overwhelmed me with joyful greetings. Upon his pressing invitation, I
                     was prevailed upon to remain with him and his family until the succeeding day,
                     and thus I was favored with ample opportunities to witness the disposition of
                     the sick mother, and enjoy her conversations. For this, though I never much
                     liked a sick room, I afterwards became thankful; for I felt that I had, in
                     rehearsing the many exploits I had had with her husband, opened<pb n="64-65"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000033"/> new sources for her enjoyment, whilst I likewise
                     learnt a lesson of the human heart which I can never fail to hold in
                     remembrance. Upon one occasion, in entering her apartment, I found her
                     affectionately playing with her boy, and remarked upon the pleasure she must
                     experience in the possession of so fine a plaything.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, sir," said she, "I have my amusement with him. Day after day I thus
                     while away many an hour, which might otherwise be rendered dull and tedious, so
                     pleasantly that I scarcely note its passage."</p>
                  <p>"Without him," remarked I, desirous of ascertaining how so long a period of
                     confinement could be endured, "time would, no doubt, hang heavily upon you, and
                     your sources of comfort and pleasure be much diminished?"</p>
                  <p>"Since I have become accustomed to the many gratifications he has brought me, I
                     can scarcely endure his absence for a single day. Though he is not my only
                     source of comfort and amusement, to lose him would be a most terrible
                     affliction."</p>
                  <p>"How," continued I, putting the question direct, "could you tolerate this long
                     confinement, and yet retain your youthful glee? I should long since have
                     perished from utter despondency."</p>
                  <p>"It was not so easily done," was her answer, whilst a pleasant smile lighted up
                     her countenance, "yet I made every effort to maintain my spirits, and with the
                     kind assistance of all around me, I happily succeeded." After speaking of the
                     many kindnesses of her friends, and the constant devotion of her husband, in so
                     animating a manner that I could not help fully sharing in her feelings, she
                     continued: "If I cannot move with the busy world, I constantly hear of it, and
                     often think of it. To appreciate and feel its pleasures, it is not always
                     necessary that we should actively participate in them. The heart and mind are
                     the seats of true enjoyment, and the occurrences and events of busy life can
                     only be pleasing as they harmonize with the one or the other, whatever may be
                     your condition. There is no joy, unless you reach them by the right direction,
                     and no pain, unless you approach them wrongly. The measure of happiness depends
                     more upon the manner in which they are made to move, than upon external causes.
                     They are likewise mighty sources of comfort and amusement within themselves. I
                     had lived happily for a number of years, partaking of all the enjoyments my
                     tastes suggested, or opportunity presented; and since confined in this room, I
                     have again and again lived over my former life. Every incident has been
                     reviewed, even from my infancy to the present hour. This retrospective life, if
                     I may so denominate it, is very singular, and withal, very pleasing. The pure
                     pleasure of a good action is often little experienced whilst you are performing
                     it, but felt most<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6407-00000034"/> keenly after it has
                     been done. At times an occurrence makes you tremble with affright whilst
                     beholding it, and when your momentary terror has subsided, its ridiculous
                     nature convulses you with laughter. I have known men to fret, and scold, and
                     swear, for entire days at the inconveniences that beset them, and when safely
                     over their difficulties, sit down and detail them again and again with the most
                     heartfelt merriment. I remember having once encountered a traveller, who was so
                     provoked at the miserable condition of the road, and the cold winter weather,
                     as very audibly to wish the company in a much warmer locality more than fifty
                     times during the slow journey; yet, a few days after, I met him comfortably
                     seated before a cheerful fire with a friend, whilst tears of unrestrained
                     laughter rolled down his cheeks, as he rehearsed this part of his rough
                     experience. Such are the effects of a combination of the past and the present
                     upon the mind, and so is it with this retrospective life. That which caused
                     pleasure once, or made you joyful and merry, will always renew the like
                     emotions whenever you think of it; that which truly enlisted the feelings of
                     the heart at one time, will never fail to do so again whenever you ponder upon
                     it; that which in any way seriously affected you once, will continue to do so
                     as often as it may be brought to your remembrance; and the recollection even of
                     many of those things which you would fain have averted or avoided, may prove
                     objects of gratification. Think of this, if you please, and by directing your
                     attention more studiously and carefully upon the past, experiment for yourself,
                     and you will find that the soul's impressions are not perishable. Examine the
                     hours gone by, and you will discover for your future old age beauties which
                     your present youth cannot fully comprehend or justly appreciate, and sources of
                     enjoyment scarcely known to you now. Nature has so ordained, and most
                     charitably and wisely, that each day passed in active, vigorous youth, should
                     provide for the quiet amusements of age—that the pleasures of one period of
                     life should happily be productive of delights for the other, instead of being
                     felt but for the moment and then forgotten forever."</p>
                  <p>"No doubt, madam," remarked I, "you are very correct in what you have said; but
                     to be compelled by necessity, at an age like yours, just properly adapted for
                     active participation in the affairs and pleasures of life, to resort to such
                     means of enjoyment, can scarcely be supposed to place you in so happy a
                     condition as that which you have assigned to old age."</p>
                  <p>"You may, perhaps," continued she, "be partly right, but you are much more
                     wrong. Short, comparatively, as has been my life, it has furnished material
                     enough for an age of thought, and by using it I have<pb n="68-69"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000035"/> again and again felt the pleasures of the soul.
                     Then, too, this was not a dream life, the idle vapors of which could be
                     dispelled by a sudden transition to reality, for there was nothing in it that
                     had not, at one time, been really seen and felt. It was rather a life of quiet
                     and happy reflection. It is not a dream nor delusion to wander back, by the
                     marvellous power of thought, and take your accustomed place once more at the
                     social board of a loved and peaceful home, and have again renewed within you
                     the feelings of youth. It so resembles the substantial truth that we can
                     scarcely discern a difference, and revives sympathies so pleasing that we
                     involuntarily desire their constant presence. The spirit ever retains its hold
                     upon the past, and the delightful hours of childhood, when we drank in the many
                     joys of our young and unruffled life, come back again to awaken the same
                     emotions that animated us then. The affections once more leap into young and
                     untainted existence, and we feel as guilelessly happy and buoyant as in youth.
                     No occurrence fails to re-enlist our attention, but each trifling incident
                     contributes its just portion to our pleasure. How much we doat upon these
                     things, and how fondly we cherish them! There," directing my attention to a
                     neat little article, "lies a trifling relic of one with whom I had spent many
                     of my days in girlish companionship. She no more walks the earth, for she sank
                     quietly and peacefully into the grave, just as she was budding into beautiful
                     womanhood. She had done the work appointed unto her, and Death gathered her to
                     himself; but, though she is buried, I never gaze upon that small trinket
                     without calling up again her sweet image from its solemn resting place to
                     experience once more, perhaps more vigorously than ever, the many pleasures we
                     had enjoyed together. Here," lifting up her hand, "is a token of friendship
                     which I need but gaze upon to revive a variety of remembrances so pleasing that
                     I would not exchange them for the most valuable treasure. How well do I
                     remember the day, the very hour, though sad it may have been, when this tiny
                     ring first encircled my finger! It was an hour of parting between loving
                     friends, yet not an hour in which they forgot each other. Though far away, she
                     still remembers me as ardently as I retain my recollections of her, and the
                     many happy moments we spent together. Happily, however, it needs not these
                     material trifles to wrest from oblivion the incidents of our lives. One after
                     another we can breathe them into existence as often as we will, through the
                     powers upon which they have made an enduring impression, and as they re-appear
                     before us, the hallowed shadows of substances once enjoyed, we become enchanted
                     with their loveliness. There is a beauty in this review of life, in thus living
                     over again the years gone by, that affords the richest comfort to the
                     soul."</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6407-00000036"/>
                  <p>"Is it then," queried I, "by thus asking pleasures of an active and happy past,
                     that you have maintained your freshness of mind and brilliancy of spirits? In
                     another, the same things would have caused melancholy and desponding regrets,
                     by exhibiting in contrast a hopeless and pleasureless future."</p>
                  <p>"My future," she pleasantly replied, "is not hopeless, but were it even so, the
                     consequences could not be so sad; neither will it ever be more void of
                     amusement than the present, which is full of enjoyment. It is an old Spanish
                     maxim, well suited to the temper of the Spaniard, that 'he who loseth wealth,
                     loseth much; he who loseth a friend, loseth more; but he who loseth his
                     spirits, loseth all.' With so fatal a loss, the mind sinks deep into despair,
                     and the heart finds nothing to cheer it. Our natural organization, however, is
                     happily provided with guards and barriers against it, and to those who are not
                     permitted to mingle in society, this retrospective life is the best and noblest
                     of them all. There is no reliable middle course in affliction, and if you guard
                     against the pressure of unfavorable circumstances, you not merely avoid the
                     dangers of despondency, but also increase your capacities for enjoyment. Your
                     heart will mellow and expand by sickness, and whatever coldness or indifference
                     characterized it, will yield before the power of sympathy. The ill in your
                     nature will be imperceptibly destroyed, and the good remain standing alone.
                     Where before you were quick to censure, you will manifest generous forbearance,
                     and even positive injuries will be forgotten and forgiven. How well is this
                     state and condition adapted for a review of the past! Whilst it causes you to
                     extend friendship to those whom you hated, it attaches you so closely to those
                     whom you loved that your very being seems to become blended with theirs. In
                     your adoration of them, their lives are made part of your own, and though they
                     may not always claim an interest so intense, they afford equal enjoyment. You
                     ponder upon their adventures, contrasting them with your own, and each separate
                     incident affords new matter for the employment of your thoughts. If, then, I
                     have my own life spread out before me, and the lives of those who are nearest
                     and dearest to me, have I not sources of enjoyment sufficient to do much more
                     than maintain my present spirits and buoyancy."</p>
                  <p>Thus she continued ever finding something to interest her mind, and bring
                     pleasure to her lively affections; whilst I felt pleased with this happy
                     manifestation of her well-trained disposition, and found in it much to
                     instruct. Here was one whom I had regarded as a fit object for compassion,
                     enjoying herself more than the vast mass of humanity much better situated for
                        enjoyment<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6407-00000037"/> ment. All this, too, by
                     properly guarding and guiding her thoughts. Here was a commentary on human
                     happiness, showing how well we are adapted for pleasure, and what sources of
                     comfort we may be of ourselves. The deep and unseen springs of sensibility and
                     joy within us, thus made to gush forth at our will, augur a higher and sublimer
                     destiny. The crude philosopher, or the still cruder sceptic, may doubt and
                     deny, but still they will continue to direct him to the imperishable
                     testimonies of immortality. It is not within us to believe, that the power
                     which dictates and controls our thoughts and our impulses, so tender that every
                     impression made upon it even in infancy retains its hold until the grave closes
                     over us, is destined to be forever obliterated. Even in life, it gives us
                     evidences of eternity. Should we live for countless ages, though the particles
                     composing our bodies might continually yield to decay and be replaced by
                     others, its own identity would be maintained, nor could we erase from it the
                     impressions of our childhood. No change in life can destroy it, or move it from
                     its directing and controlling sphere. Is it, then, merely the unsatisfying
                     mystery of an invisible element, endowed with the capacity of preserving and
                     summoning before us the shadows of past beauties, though doomed itself to
                     perish? Is it only a fleeting, flickering ray, simply given to illumine our
                     physical existence, whose last flash shall be forever extinguished when the
                     nature to which it was joined sinks before the rough contacts of earth, or
                     slowly dies out of its own infirmities? Happily, it awakens sweeter thoughts,
                     and inspires higher hopes. Its brightness is not like the passing lustre, of
                     the moonbeam, receding behind the first murky cloud that floats across its
                     path, but may be made to shine only the more brilliantly through the
                     surrounding darkness. With her, whose afflictions and pleasures I have faintly
                     described, it was not a mere visionary creature, conjured up by powerful
                     imagery, and clothed with the devices of a fine fancy, yet compelled, to fall
                     before the first truthful reality it encountered. Following out its mission in
                     truth, it is our faithful companion and guide through life; and who shall deny
                     it another sphere of nobler existence, where it may never cease to feast upon
                     the untold loveliness of creation, and forever dwell upon the past, reviewing
                     its own good deeds with unabating gratitude to its author, and unending
                     happiness to itself.</p>

                  <head type="sub">WHICH HAD SERVED AS AN ENVELOPE TO THE FOLLOWING PAPER.</head>
                  <p>THE manuscript enclosed was found upon the desk of the Secretary and read by
                     permission. The author, perhaps to his own credit, cautiously withheld his
                     name. Though many inquiries were made without success, I could not avoid
                     ascribing its paternity to a young rogue near me, who appeared greatly pleased
                     with it; and after the reading, desired the Junto to take the labor of reducing
                     the practice of lying to a science under its immediate supervision and
                     protection. This imprudent expression of his wish at once involved him in
                     numerous difficulties. It was looked upon as a very slanderous reflection, and
                     the poor fellow was so roughly handled that he not only gladly withdrew it, but
                     himself also, perhaps a little wiser than he had been before. His difficulties
                     no doubt impressed him with a proper idea of the value of discretion, and
                     certainly taught him that no matter how much men may be given to evil habits,
                     they are averse to having their faults paraded before their own eyes as well as
                     to seeing them exposed to the gaze of others. They may be addicted to a
                     disgraceful practice, yet ask them to avow and openly protect it, and they will
                     raise such a terrible clatter about your ears that you are fain to withdraw as
                     speedily as possible.</p>

                  <p>OF the many practices to which our people are addicted, and which exhibit their
                     progress towards the higher walks of civilization, there is none more prominent
                     than the habit of lying. Celius wrote of Pompey, "he is wont to think one thing
                     and speak another;" and we may say, that amongst us, it has almost become
                     difficult to decide, whether we act upon the principle that language was
                     invented to express our thoughts, or simply for the purpose of enabling us to
                     conceal them.</p>
                  <p>I have an old friend who, adding to a mind accustomed to accurate observation,
                     more than fifty years of experience, frequently remarks that he has never yet
                     had half a dozen conversations with any person, without detecting<pb n="78-79"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000040"/> a falsehood.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"

                      It is well known that in our day it is scarcely possible to bargain
                     even with a saint, without discovering him a liar; and I verily believe that
                     had all who ever indulged this habit been treated like Ananias and his spouse,
                     the world would long since have been depopulated. Fortunately, none are now so
                     summarily punished, or there would be a terrible "falling down and giving up of
                     the ghost." For this generous forbearance, we may, perhaps, be indebted to the
                     superiority which we have acquired over these two rude victims. We have
                     certainly improved somewhat upon their example, yet it must be owned that our
                     progress in this habit has not been commensurate with that made in the other
                     improvements of the age. Some of the fabrications of the Carthaginians and old
                     Assyrians, noted for their proficiency in this particular, were greatly
                     superior to any encountered in the present day. We have lost the ancient
                     spirit, which, it is feared, can only be revived by re-enacting some of the
                     ancient laws. For instance, in Sparta, it is said, thieves were punished, not
                     for stealing, but for permitting themselves to be caught; the lawmakers, no
                     doubt, arguing that the fool deserves severer chastisement than the rogue. Were
                     the same rule adopted now as to lying, it would soon close the mouths of those
                     arrant bunglers who so frequently provoke our ridicule and contempt.</p>

                        secret political organization, one of whose principles is universally
                        felt to be the worst species of lying, it may not be long before it will
                        be extremely difficult to find a man of real truth.—ED.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>Man was originally endowed with the power of clear and distinct articulation,
                     which, after some improvement, enabled him to convey what ideas he pleased to
                     his fellows. It is agreeable to all experience that in using this excellent
                     gift, he should consult his own convenience, and he has accordingly introduced
                     this habit of lying. From the highest to the humblest, and from the grayhaired
                     old man to his youthful grand-child, all find it of use. The priest, the
                     lawyer, the physician, have rendered it a necessary part of their professions.
                     Tradesmen and mechanics have by no means neglected it, and some have made such
                     signal use of it, that we now look upon the sons of Crispin as comparable only
                     to a horde of Cretians, who, we are assured by excellent authority, <emph>were
                        always liars.</emph> The conveniences resulting from this practice have ever
                     been so very apparent, that its origin was almost coeval with the existence of
                     man; for one of our primitive ancestors, after exhibiting his moral depravity
                     by murdering his brother, was stupid enough,<pb n="80-81"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000041"/> when asked the whereabouts of the slain, to
                     answer the all-knowing questioner, "I know not; am I my brother's keeper?"
                     Since his day it has been introduced into every walk of life, and is now used
                     without reference to the occasion—some being even so addicted to it as to tell
                     a lie when the simple truth would answer better. In childhood we seek to avoid
                     the rod by resorting to it, and when we attain to years of discretion we find
                     it convenient upon much more trifling occasions. Does some intolerable bore
                     intrude upon you, you dismiss him to the digestion of a lie, and find pleasure
                     in the reflection of having done so. When an impatient creditor duns you, what
                     more convenient than a plausible falsehood? When an appeal is made to your
                     purse by some importunate borrower or beggar, you know well how to answer him
                     by an untruth. Should you get into difficulty, you study what virtue there is
                     in language, and use it to effect your end. When an inquisitive wife pests you
                     with her troublesome inquiries, you have the example of an honorable Roman
                     senator for telling her a lie; and when you have broken a promise, why, you
                     know well how to excuse yourself by resorting to the same means that caused its
                     violation.</p>
                  <p>Knowing the great conveniences of this habit, and being masters of our tongues,
                     the fault lies with us if we cannot touch whatever chord in the nature of our
                     fellows that we wish to arouse. To attain this degree of perfection, however,
                     we should be properly schooled. Ever since the times of Thauth, Hermes, and
                     Cadmus, many have endeavored to excel in efforts to reduce the gift of speech
                     to writing, and to regular rules and systems. Every variety of sciences,
                     whatever their pretensions, have so used it as best to promote their interests,
                     inventing new words, or assigning strange meanings to old ones, whenever
                     occasion required. It has been the great fountain and support of every
                     excellence of which we know, and the powerful medium of every humbug that has
                     heretofore cursed society. It may, therefore, appear strange that no one has
                     yet, for the great benefit of mankind in general, resorted to it for the
                     elements to establish, as a distinct profession, the art of well and skillfully
                     framing a falsehood.</p>
                  <p>The schools of philosophy have settled it that men may lie. Whether they have
                     done so upon the strength of the bold opinion of the crafty Lysander, that
                     truth and falsehood are indifferent things; or upon the comprehensive saying of
                     Sophocles, "I judge no speech amiss that is of use;" or upon the more designing
                     maxim of the Spaniard, "tell a lie and you will get out the truth;" or upon the
                     anatomical principle of the petit Prince of Bantam, which will certainly be
                     admired by our modern physiologists, "my tongue has no bone in<pb n="82-83"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000042"/> it to make it more stiff than is necessary for
                     my interest;" it is not material here to determine. Suffice it, that it has
                     been so settled, and as our practices conform to so enlightened a decision,
                     policy would seem to require that they be reduced to regular and systematic
                     rules. It is true, some have manifested considerable anxiety to secure for this
                     habit a kind of scientific distinction. They have accordingly had resort to the
                     stars, or if despairing of flights so lofty, the hand or a pack of cards
                     answered equally well to tell a fortune by. Though their plans and schemes were
                     sufficiently ingenious, lying itself could not endure them. They could hope for
                     no proselytes except amongst the credulous, and even amongst those they could
                     only gain such as believed there was as much "pleasure in being cheated as to
                     cheat." Thus their efforts in this excellent work, have not only been defeated,
                     notwithstanding the high encouragement they sometimes received, but if
                     Euripides speaks to the purpose, they themselves have been made to feel the
                     consequences of their mistakes: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"What's an Astrologer? I thus reply,</l>
                           <l>A man who speaks few truths, but many a lie,</l>
                           <l>Which, when found out, he takes his heels to fly."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Perhaps their great failure is principally to be attributed to the narrow
                     defectiveness of the founder of their tribe. It is true, the worthy man's name
                     has not yet been definitely ascertained, but then this very ignorance has
                     helped us out of our perplexities in searching for it. The writers and critics
                     upon Junius, when unable to discover the author of the famous letters, very
                     sagely conclude that he was a man who had made himself acquainted with the
                     affairs of his time, and who was, withal, somewhat of a genius. So Voltaire has
                     disposed of this query in a very summary manner, by assuring us that "the first
                     rogue who met with the first blockhead" was the inventor of soothsaying. Whilst
                     this conclusion has been generally accepted as a very satisfactory one, it must
                     be admitted that, though he may have been an acute rogue, he was none the less
                     an indiscreet one, or he would not have attempted to confine this important
                     privilege and practice of lying within so exclusive a circle.</p>
                  <p>There could be no lack of material in speech upon which to construct a system
                     of scientific lying. Perhaps, by applying to it a term which has long since
                     been banished from "ears polite," on account of its harshness, I may be accused
                     of a want of interest in so noble an enterprise. If so, I can only render as an
                     excuse, that if lying can claim any one merit more than another, it is that of
                     having ever maintained its own identity, no matter what efforts were made to
                     increase its<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6407-00000043"/> respectability by titles
                     supposed to be more delicate. In this particular, it must be owned, it has
                     always resembled its author, who, whether known as Satan or Beelzebub, Lucifer
                     or Pluto, is nothing but the plain, common devil after all; and who, though you
                     should call him an angel, would be the devil still. Thus sacrificing no merit
                     which it can justly claim, the difficulties of reducing it to a science could
                     be easily overcome.</p>
                  <p>An old maxim has it that "fools and children sometimes speak the truth." If
                     "maxims are the condensed good sense of nations," as Sir James Mackintosh
                     pithily observes, it would require excessive presumption to deny the wisdom of
                     this one, so universally received and acted upon. The ancient moralists, after
                     rearing a queer medley of truth and nonsense upon a few wise sayings,
                     pronounced the heterogeneous mass the "Science of Morality." This was at least
                     generous, for it must be owned that a more convenient appellation for all who
                     desired to sin according to moral law, could not have been invented by their
                     philosophic magnanimity. "It is in the creed, sir," would have answered every
                     accusation, and put an end to all further contention. "Know thyself," and "Too
                     much of nothing," proverbial sayings for ages, were so well received that the
                     seven wise men of Greece consecrated them to Apollo, and inscribed them in
                     letters of gold upon the door of his temple at Delphos. After so important a
                     precedent of respect to maxims, notwithstanding the many changes wrought by
                     time since the days of Thales and Solon, he who should seek to reduce the
                     practice of lying to scientific rules, might claim equal consideration for the
                     axiom given above, which he would of course so interpret as to make all wise
                     men liars. If the wisest and the best who ever assumed the troublesome nature
                     of man, could hang all the law and the prophets upon two commandments, surely
                     the modern man of science might build a system upon a single maxim, whose
                     object would be more to increase the dominion of Satan than the glory of a
                     different kingdom. The service he would thus render to society would be
                     incalculable, and forever perpetuate his name as one of its most worthy
                     benefactors. By teaching the public, young and old, and without distinction of
                     sex, to lie according to an approved system, our contempt would no longer be
                     aroused by the fools now addicted to the practice, and who constantly exhibit a
                     stupidity only equalled by that of the first liar of whom we have any record.
                     Though we may have mules in the professions, who only make work for keener and
                     shrewder knaves, and blunderers in the sciences, this should be no excuse for
                     bunglers in this most worthy art of lying. Such, however, could readily be got
                     rid of by elevating the habit to the dignity of a science, which<pb n="86-87"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000044"/> each should be permitted to practice after being
                     skilled in its rules. To secure the more general proficiency of those who
                     desired to study the system, it should be made an indispensable antecedent
                     requisite, that they be fully worthy of their Prince, and as honest as the
                     Lombardian sect spoken of in the bull of Pope Adrian VI., who fully ackowledged
                     the devil as their head, and promised obedience to him.</p>

                  <head type="sub">FILED AWAY WITH THE FOLLOWING TALE.</head>
                  <p>THE tale of the Alchemist was related at our meeting to a concourse of as
                     drowsy listeners as I ever saw congregated around a cheerful fire. The
                     individual who related it, however, manifested a deep interest in every
                     incident of the story. Indeed, when he arrived at some of the more startling
                     and mysterious passages in it, he gave them with a ghostly intonation of voice,
                     slowly and cautiously, looking anxiously around him to discover what impression
                     they made. He exerted all his powers to be interesting, and preserved a very
                     serious air throughout; which caused me to greatly suspect him as one of those
                     easy-natured creatures, who are ever willing to believe whatever they hear,
                     without troubling their heads for philosophic reasons, or permitting their
                     faith to be at all interfered with by measuring probabilities.</p>
                  <p>After he had finished, it was soon ascertained that the story is a genuine
                     tradition, as faithfully believed by many as any chapter in their Bibles, and
                     certainly oftener thought of and repeated. Upon being questioned, he replied
                     that he had heard it from a number of citizens of well-known veracity, and that
                     to doubt it was regarded, in the neighborhood where the events occurred, as the
                     rankest heresy. Then, too, he added, it has some strong points to recommend it
                     to our belief: it definitely disposes of several matters which would otherwise
                     be compelled to remain forever unsettled; it is old, and many have
                        heretofore<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6407-00000045"/> given it full credit,
                     which should make us slow to doubt; much of it is marvelous, and therefore
                     incomprehensible, and what we cannot understand it would be irrational to
                     condemn or deny.</p>
                  <p>This provided against every doubt, and left no other choice but to believe or
                     remain silent. The latter seemed to be generally preferred, and the story was
                     accordingly received as one of those strange tales in which every town used to
                     abound, and filed away as a part of the traditional history of the village to
                     which it related.</p>

                  <head type="sub">OR, THE MAGIC FUNNEL.</head>
                  <p>IN a small village on the banks of the Susquehanna, several miles from the
                     present location of the capitol of Pennsylvania, many years ago, there lived a
                     very singular individual known to the villagers by the name of Felix Deford. He
                     resided in a little log building at one end of the village, and during the
                     first year of his abode there, never spoke over half a dozen words to any one
                     of his neighbors. This strange exclusiveness, in a community so small that each
                     one not only knew the other but was perfectly familiar with his most trifling
                     habits and pursuits, excited great curiosity, as could very naturally have been
                     expected. He at once became the subject of general conversation, and various
                     surmises were suggested in explanation of his conduct, in the propounding of
                     which the ladies were decidedly the most<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6407-00000046"
                     /> prolific. This was owing, it was affirmed, to their naturally more
                     inquisitive dispositions; but, in the present instance, I am inclined to
                     believe that it resulted rather from their having been endowed with feelings
                     more tender and sympathetic than those of the opposite sex. This opinion seems
                     to derive great strength from the fact that their conjectures generally agreed
                     in assigning as the cause of his secluded habits, some unfortunate occurrence
                     that depressed his spirits, and made him melancholy.</p>
                  <p>It was indeed no little entertaining to hear the quiet and simple villagers, at
                     their gossipping meetings, discussing the case of this mysterious stranger, for
                     to them he was doubly a stranger, from whatever view they might regard him.
                     Though they occasionally saw him, yet so far as social intercourse was
                     concerned, he might as well have been in China. During the first year of his
                     residence amongst them, notwithstanding their many efforts to effect an
                     acquaintance, they had not been able to ascertain anything respecting him
                     beyond his name, which he never manifested the least disposition to conceal.
                     Whatever advances had been made towards a closer intimacy he had invariably
                     repelled, but always in a manner, and with a modest and attractive politeness,
                     which only prepossessed those who had made them the more in his favor. Instead
                     of losing their interest in him through the progress of time, their anxiety
                     daily increased to obtain some knowledge of his manner of life, if nothing
                     more. As yet, no one had been inside of his house since he resided in it, not
                     even the rent collector, upon whom all had looked as likely, at least
                     partially, to gratify them in this particular.</p>
                  <p>On a warm evening in the month of August, a large party met at the house of one
                     of the villagers, when, as was usual at such gatherings, the subject of
                     conversation turned upon the queer habits of Felix Deford. One fair young
                     creature, who had once been favored with a sight of him, gave it as her
                     opinion, that not having heeded the judicious counsel of Sophocles, "never let
                     woman rob thee of thy wits," his hopes had been wrecked in some sad and
                     unsuccessful love adventure. In giving vent to her sympathies for the
                     unfortunate Felix, she did not refrain from denouncing the cruelty of some of
                     her sex in a manner which modestly intimated, that her own heart would never
                     have permitted her to send so devoted a lover as he must have been into
                     miserable exile. This was immediately taken up by a sharp-visaged,
                     hatchet-faced specimen of the ancient maiden lady, whose beauty, had she lived
                     ages ago, would scarcely have induced the most forlorn Grecian gallant to
                     pronounce her, in the expressive and complimentary phrase of his time, "a
                     virgin who gained oxen." For<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6407-00000047"/> forty
                     years she had experienced the terrors of single blessedness, from what cause
                     she could not divine, which had by no means rendered her patient and
                     charitable. She unhesitatingly advanced it as her judgment, that his conduct,
                     if love had anything to do with it, resulted rather from remorse of conscience
                     for past offences than from female cruelty. Examples of this kind were not
                     wanting, and she herself had once known a Frenchman the recollection of whose
                     wicked amours so preyed upon his mind that he voluntarily banished himself from
                     the sight of men—as severe a punishment, it was thought, as could possibly be
                     inflicted upon a Frenchman. An old lady here interposed, and related a story of
                     a melancholy individual, whose many deplorable mishaps had fully convinced him
                     of the ancient theory, that each one was born under a good or an evil genius.
                     It had been his direful fate to have been ushered into the world under one of
                     the latter kind. Whatever he had been prompted to undertake, soon gave evidence
                     that, however fickle a goddess Fortune may be, to him she was ever constant:
                     not that she loved him, but merely because she was even more patient and
                     spiteful than an affronted Corsair. Nothing would prosper under his protection,
                     though he had been as watchful as a vestal virgin. He had frequently envied the
                     Grecian youth who, killing his stepmother in endeavoring to hurl a stone at a
                     dog, exclaimed, "Fortune had a better aim than I." If luck had been half as
                     favorably inclined towards him, some fortunate accident would not so long have
                     permitted a Fury in the form of a termagant wife to have added to his troubles.
                     After wooing Fortune for a number of years to no purpose, he at length
                     determined at least to escape her frowns and punishments, if he could not share
                     her civilities; and therefore betook himself to the wood to adopt the life of
                     the anchorite. What became of him after this was never clearly ascertained, but
                     it was supposed his evil genius had found in him too good a subject to be
                     abandoned to the whining winds of the forest. To this a young gentleman replied
                     that he had good reason to believe that Felix was not so much a fool. He at
                     least gave evidence of possessing more fortitude, judging from the manner in
                     which he had resisted the repeated and troublesome inquiries of the villagers.
                     It may be, suggested the young man, that he had come to the village from mere
                     love of a retired life; or, perhaps, being of studious habits, he sought its
                     quietude to prosecute his researches. Another one remarked, that he had once
                     known a very worthy and pious minister, who had been so exclusively given to
                     religious meditations, that he had often wished for the most solemn privacy and
                     quietude; and had it not been for the sweet temper of his lovely wife and her
                     happy efforts to interest and cheer him, he<pb n="94-95"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000048"/> would inevitably have shut himself up in some
                     dungeon. An interesting young Miss, who had spent much of her time in reading
                     novels, now thought it her turn to venture an opinion, which she did by drawing
                     upon the extensive and valuable stock of stories hoarded in her memory. She had
                     often read of men, who, though they could not transform themselves like Mris,
                     the magical shepherd, or become altogether lycanthropic, yet abandoned human
                     society to mingle with wild beasts in forests and deserts, or in the darker
                     recesses of cliffs and caves. Having fixed their affections upon some object,
                     their souls became wrapped up in its pursuit and attainment, and when
                     disappointed, they could not withstand the revulsion of feeling that
                     necessarily followed, and therefore flew to solitude. Some of these,
                     interrupted the sharp-visaged elderly lady before alluded to, were no doubt
                     driven to such extremities through the excessive indulgence of evil passions,
                     through bitter regrets and remorse, through a deep sense of their infamy, or to
                     hide their shame whilst planning new villanies to be practiced after the old
                     ones had been forgotten.</p>
                  <p>This proved an unfortunate interruption, and had a remarkable effect in
                     preparing the minds of the party for what followed. Under the influence of a
                     particular impression, we are often led to make ourselves ridiculous, or to do
                     that of which we afterwards seriously repent pent. The ideas naturally prompted
                     by the words of the last speaker, were well intended to reverse the course of
                     their remarks when aided by what transpired immediately after. She had scarcely
                     finished her insinuating speech, before a new acquisition was made to the
                     circle by the entrance of a young man, a simple, good-natured soul, whose silly
                     humors had frequently afforded amusement to his more knowing acquaintances. He
                     reported that, having just passed Deford's house, he heard a terrible racket,
                     and upon endeavoring to ascertain the cause, by placing his head against the
                     door, he became so much alarmed by the mixed confusion within that he quickly
                     hastened away. True, he had seen nothing, but his ears had convinced him that
                     the sounds were unearthly, and not the voices of ordinary human beings. They
                     were unlike anything he had ever heard before, and then, too, they were
                     accompanied by singular groans and painful hisses, by the clatter of chains,
                     and the jingling of small sharp-sounding bells, and by a confused noise which
                     much resembled that occasioned by rapidly striking two pieces of sheet-iron
                     against each other. Such a formidable array of incomprehensible things had not
                     failed to make a very visible impression upon the countenance of the young man,
                     which, however, was only regarded as confirming his tale. After this
                     astonishing narration, though before there were few in that circle<pb n="96-97"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000049"/> who had not regarded Felix as an honest,
                     well-bred gentleman, there was little charity left amongst them, and indeed
                     much less sense. Their minds were now directed into another channel of thought,
                     and quite different causes were alleged as explanatory of Deford's habits—so
                     sure are we to follow the lead of what is uppermost in our heads, though we
                     should be rendered the veriest fools for our pains. Each of them now had some
                     fanciful story to relate, and it soon became the settled conviction that poor
                     Felix had to be shunned, for there could be no telling what mischief he might
                     bring upon the village. Some expressed their thoughts that perhaps he might be
                     nothing more than an escaped convict after all, or some despicable outlaw, who
                     was compelled to keep himself hid to avoid detection. Others had heard of
                     highwaymen and freebooters, after a long life of crime and infamy, retiring to
                     some private habitation quietly to enjoy their plunder, and repent of their
                     misdeeds at leisure: a practice now much in vogue amongst lesser criminals, and
                     highly honorable in refined and civilized communities, though it was then
                     little known to the rude and industrious villagers. Others, still, had heard of
                     those who hunted up unfrequented and gloomy places to meet the hideous spectres
                     of the night in their peregrinations "up and down the earth;" whilst a fourth
                     even recollected individual instances of miserable wretches resorting to hidden
                     and secluded spots to hold communion with the evil one. Certain it was, there
                     were few now in that circle who were willing to affirm that Deford's conduct
                     was the result of good motives or an honorable career. The tide of opinion was
                     turned against him, so sure is an odd demeanor, sooner or later, destined to
                     breed ill-thoughts in those around us, and arouse suspicion. Curiosity hates to
                     be baffled, and when it seizes hold of an entire neighborhood, it becomes a
                     dangerous thing, and the discreet and judicious man will always avoid it.
                     Without a guide to govern and control it, the itching phrensy of
                     inquisitiveness is as limitless in its range as it is void of reason and
                     discretion.</p>
                  <p>Whilst, however, the villagers had been moved to the highest degree of anxiety
                     to learn something more of Felix than simply his name, he was no less curious
                     concerning matters of quite a different character, but which were of about
                     equal significance. Unfortunately for him, he was one of those deluded,
                     so-called philosophers who have always had their counterparts in all ages of
                     the world; and who, despising simple and common things, as a French commentator
                     truly observes, followed the lead of quaint fancies and cheating vagaries, even
                     rejecting the plainest truths unless they came invested with a charm to gratify
                     their desire for the extraordinary and marvelous. Every fantastic story of
                     ghost or goblin<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6407-00000050"/> that had come to his
                     knowledge, and every mysterious witch transaction, had, to him, been important
                     matters for study. He had squandered many days in search of, an antidote to
                     decrease the dominion of death, yet never attempted to wrest from its grasp any
                     poor victim of disease. "Was there not," he would ask of himself, "a tree of
                     life in the garden of Eden, and if its fruit possessed the magic power of
                     imparting perpetual life, has nature lost the qualities and elements of which
                     they were composed? Are we not informed by the ancient Skalds and Sagas, that
                     the heroes and warriors of old, when pressed down and enfeebled by age,
                     repaired to the fair and beautiful Iduna, to eat of the 'apples of youth,' and
                     become young again?" To him, the efforts of the Spanish voyager, Juan Ponce de
                     Leon, in search of the mystic spring, located, by tradition, somewhere amongst
                     the sands of Florida, a sip of whose precious waters imparted rejuvenescence,
                     and secured perennial youth, had been an enterprise so noble that better
                     success should have crowned it. Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastes Paracelsus
                     Honenhelm, after first pruning down his monstrous name to decent proportions,
                     which was, perhaps, the most sensible act he performed during his life, became
                     possessed of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">elixir vita.</foreign> "If," thought
                     Felix, "the foolish neglect of a careless and fickle world, which not
                     unfrequently throws away its greatest bless ings, or treats them with contempt
                     for long periods of time, permitted such important knowledge to be entirely
                     lost, the best, if not the only thing that can be done, is to endeavor to
                     restore it again." Most excellent reasoning, and practical enough for a better
                     cause. How vast, how immeasurably incalculable would be the results following
                     the revelation of these hidden mysteries, which formed but a trifling portion
                     of the wonderful and marvelous things to the investigation of which Felix had
                     devoted his life! The elixir of Paracelsus would effectually banish from the
                     world the innumerable nostrums now poured down the throats of the public in
                     torrents which threaten to supersede entirely the use of nature's beverage as a
                     drink. The visitors to Florida would far exceed in number and array the
                     pilgrims to Mecca, or the deluded travellers towards the holy waters of the
                     Ganges. Fortunate Iduna! what a mighty host of love-sick swains would woo thee!
                     Who, then, would have reason to lament over the terrible inroads of age? The
                     pleasant and innocent means now resorted to, with most commendable patience and
                     perseverance, to conceal its hated furrows and wrinkles, would be doomed to
                     oblivion, as things interdicted from human remembrance. The novelty of nature,
                     unadorned by such admirable arts, which many have been so anxious to behold,
                     would then be everywhere paraded to the popular gaze, and habit<pb n="100-101"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000051"/> would soon accustom us to its sight. Some
                     inspired poet, then, might sing a doleful requiem over rouge and pearl, and no
                     loving youth would be compelled to search a clear, unpainted, and unpowdered
                     spot whereon to kiss his lady-love. None, too, would then be moved to reecho

                     range, the world might possibly become stocked with a superior order of men,
                     and its wickedness cease to be a constant and an endless subject of complaint.
                     It would then be a delight to live in it amid its general harmony and concord;
                     and none would be made to appreciate the feelings frequently expressed by a
                     friend of mine, who always resolved, whenever disgusted at the depravity now
                     too common, to emigrate to some uninhabited island, and commence the world
                     anew, in imitation of old Adam, firmly believing that he could raise a better
                     brood.</p>
                  <p>Felix Deford, however, during his residence in the village, had been more
                     particularly engaged in other inquiries. The things which we ordinarily
                     encounter during life, were far too dull and stupid for his ardent nature. He
                     longed for something more extraordinary and marvelous, and accordingly betook
                     himself to search for it. He had wit enough to know, that nature, so far as it
                     is understood, has fixed a certain, definite rule of government which had first
                     to be surmounted before the supernatural could be attained. This had been done
                     long before his time, and so very signally, that even the most wonderful
                     metamorphosis were wrought with perfect ease. Does not Pliny himself affirm,
                     and he certainly should have known, that the change of females into males is
                     not fabulous, and Montaigne assure us that he actually saw a man who had once
                     been a woman? Thanks, we should rather say to Felix, that such magic powers are
                     known no more; for in our day, when women so madly aspire to man's condition,
                     the stock would soon be entirely lost. Felix, however, apprehended no evil
                     consequences from such a discovery, for women would then be no longer needed,
                     and who, argued he, could, suffer to be incommoded with them but for their
                     absolute necessity? Whatever<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6407-00000052"/> dangers
                     suggested themselves to his mind upon this score, he rapidly dismissed, with
                     the reflection that the world was at no loss for inhabitants, and after a sip
                     from the mystic spring, or a slice from Iduna's apple, the race would no longer
                     require replenishing, and could therefore readily afford to dispense with the
                     fairer portion of creation. If we contemplate with awe the ruins of nations,
                     ideas of whose imposing grandeur have been transmitted to us for our admiration
                     and wonder, and ponder with melancholy anguish upon the fact that millions of
                     human creatures were crushed in their fall, what strange emotions, what
                     terrible feelings, would not be inspired by the total extinction of the most
                     lovely of the sexes—the first honored companion of solitary man in the sacred
                     bowers of Eden! No, Felix; no discovery, though it should be a secret passage
                     to the gates of Paradise, could atone for so sad a loss. Woman was the only
                     instrument of Godly mercy fit to shed a ray of sunshine upon the path of man
                     when first his race began. Though she caused him to go astray, she has done
                     much to repair her error. In the bright glory yet in reserve for her, to calm
                     and cheer the agony and despair of his last hour with the sweet and exhaustless
                     affection of her lovely nature, well will she redeem the stain her impulsive
                     confidence brought upon her angelic character.</p>
                  <p>The realization of these unnatural powers constituted the dream of Felix, and
                     for this he had devoted his hours to magic in his solitary study, which, to the
                     view of a stranger, would have much resembled the operating room of an
                     industrious philosopher. Old, musty, and neglected volumes, bearing ample
                     evidence that they had undergone the vicissitudes of many years, and suffered
                     treatment too barbarous to be entirely ascribed to the hands of studious and
                     inquisitive man, were piled promiscuously upon the shelves. Scarcely one of
                     them could boast an entire cover, and their black letter and roughly ornamented
                     pages presented a bold contrast to the volumes of the present day. Around the
                     room were seen numerous instruments, with now and then some strange
                     apparatus—things for which science had but few names, and common parlance was a
                     total blank. In one corner your eye met nothing but crucibles, mortars, urns,
                     pots, kettles, and cans; in another, yon beheld a variety of jugs, decanters,
                     bottles, and vials; whilst others contained a mass as indescribable as it was
                     nameless. All, too, bore testimony of having been frequently used, and emitted
                     a repulsive scent, sufficiently exhibiting that it required no very refined
                     sense of smell to detest the pursuit of an alchemist. The rules of neatness and
                     arrangement, however, were not neglected in all this confusion. In the centre
                     of the room a large circle was drawn, whilst the walls were totally covered
                     with odd signs, strange figures,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6407-00000053"/> and
                     mystic devices. Here it was that the magician employed his charms, and conjured
                     up his spells, and here the alchemist pursued his intricate investigations.
                     Here Felix had applied himself, with a devotion worthy of the greatest
                     commendation, to realize, by magic and alchemistic means, the dreams of those
                     deluded Germans whose fantastic theories, for so long a time, had run away with
                     the reason and good sense of their native cotemporaries, and eventually worked
                     similar results in different sections of the world. He longed to verify the
                     fancies of Rosen-creutze, which had set many a man's "wits a wool-gathering,"
                     and made strange fools of some of the cleverest, but too credulous, fellows of
                     all Europe and elsewhere. How happy he would have been in having been brought
                     into closer communion with his Maker, or made the companion of noble spirits to
                     whose wisdom he could have given the impress of utility, and thus eventually
                     succeeded in driving pain, disease, and sorrow from the world! Had not the
                     noted Dr. Torralba a magic Zequiel, apparently unlimited in power, to accompany
                     him as his pledged and faithful friend, and had not Naude's "zenith and rising
                     sun of all the Alchymists," the skilful Paracelsus, a spirit confined in the
                     hilt of his sword, and another imprisoned in a jewel? The famous magician,
                     Cornelius Agrippa, whose talents are attested by the great Erasmus and the
                     smooth and gentle Melancthon ancthon, did not only command the demons of the
                     earth and the spirits of the air, but could even break in upon the repose of
                     the dead, in the presence of whose greatness he would have cowered during their
                     lives, and summon them before him, clothed in their accustomed habiliments!
                     Though the tunic and mantle of the ancient Grecian had been decayed for
                     centuries, and his body consumed by the devouring limestone which had composed
                     his singular sarcophagus, the dismembered particles came together again, and
                     were compelled to reappear at the powerful bidding of Cornelius. This wonderful
                     knowledge of the historiographer of the Emperor Charles V., and the author of
                     the "Superiority of the Female Sex," to the great loss of the world, had been
                     permitted to perish with him, and perhaps forever. Though Felix was
                     industriously laboring to restore it again, and revive the marvels of magic and
                     alchemy, it must be acknowledged he was not exceedingly well adapted for the
                     task. Although he had energy and perseverance to surmount every conquerable
                     obstacle, he yet lacked two essential elements—he possessed too much honesty,
                     and not enough imagination. Every pursuit requires certain qualities of mind
                     and heart, and in none have imagery and dishonesty more to do than in that in
                     which he was engaged. They are indispensable to success in such<pb n="106-107"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000054"/> an enterprise, and in both Felix was deficient.
                     To speak the simple truth, there was a limit to his madness. He was weak enough
                     not to doubt the truth of the superhuman exploits and performances ascribed to
                     the masters in the art, whose works he had diligently studied; yet not
                     sufficiently crazy to see unearthly visions appearing in answer to his charms
                     and incantations, when, in truth, there was nothing but vacancy before his
                     eyes.</p>
                  <p>Combining the fanatical theories of Bohmen, with the more rational and
                     philosophic demonstrations of common chemistry, he would undoubtedly have
                     triumphed in his inquiries but for his deficiency in the qualities alluded to
                     as essential to the alchemist. Though he had dreaded a search for the
                     philosopher's stone, that great marvel for ages, after so many had failed
                     before him; yet if Agrippa had so far succeeded as to change iron into gold,
                     though it was destined to be converted into simple and worthless stone after
                     one revolution of the earth, might not an improvement be made which should
                     render the metamorphosis more permanent? Whether Agrippa had worked this
                     wonder, which, indeed, would have furnished the clue to all others, by the
                     discovery of the pebble for which so many had searched in vain, or through the
                     direct intervention of the devil, had always been a mystery to Felix; but he
                     had pondered upon it again and again, until it eventually brought him to the
                     determination of summoning his satanic majesty before him. Although satan had
                     unquestionably proved himself a bad magician, if he had been the instrument
                     made use of by Agrippa, Felix believed this was owing rather to his wily and
                     treacherous nature than to a want of power. This determination once fixed, he
                     resorted to the best approved arts usually employed in invoking demons and
                     spirits, and such had been one of his principal occupations during the latter
                     period of his residence in the village. He by no means desired their visits
                     upon mere terms of intimacy and friendship, but demanded absolute dominion over
                     them before compelling them into his presence. Justin Martyr, and all the most
                     ancient Fathers,—and certainly their statements ought to be of great
                     weight,—had too strongly depicted the horrors wrought by bad demons who had
                     visited the earth, for Felix to desire their reappearance without possessing
                     full power to control them. These learned and devout men, venerated even to
                     this day with a kind of religious fervor, had furnished enough, and more, to
                     show that such supernatural agents had not lost the worst vices of humanity,
                     but in addition possessed greater means of indulging them, which they were not
                     timid in exercising. Felix Deford knew the world's many afflictions too well to
                     wish to add any more to their number; but he believed that a charm so potent as
                     to force the powers of darkness to<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6407-00000055"/>
                     obey its summons, had only to be dispelled to drive them back to their homes
                     again.</p>
                  <p>It would be wrong to neglect stating here, that if the masters whose
                     astonishing knowledge and power Felix admired, mingled the mysteries of
                     religion with their theories and principles, he by no means disregarded them.
                     If it be true, (and who doubts it?) that in the antediluvian age, men had lived
                     so many years as to make life resemble a sweet and pleasant immortality upon
                     earth, a very remarkable change must have been effected since then. In the
                     opinions of his masters, that this long life had been the result of a closer
                     communion with the divine element, of social intercourse with the many good
                     spirits supposed to inhabit and abound in space, and of possessing a
                     controlling power over the evil ones, he saw no poetry, but the serious truths
                     of philosophy. Here, then, there had been sufficient to attract his attention
                     to the mysterious portions of his Bible, just as the disbeliever is drawn to
                     those which human intellect is incapable of solving or reconciling. His
                     researches, however, had a less ruinous effect, for they perplexed only
                     himself, and did no harm to others.</p>
                  <p>He pursued his studies, boiled his mystic herbs, applied his minerals, made his
                     magic mixtures, and resolved his wild problems, constantly expecting some
                     answer from regions which he was incapable of penetrating. His failures never
                     daunted him, for the doctrines of his masters had been too well settled in his
                     mind, and he was too thoroughly convinced of their accuracy, to permit a
                     supposition of their untruth. He was neither so vain nor impatient as to
                     reproach his predecessors because he had failed to meet with equal success, but
                     ascribed his repeated disappointments to his own deficiencies and
                     imperfections. He had been too intent upon his studies to have much concerned
                     himself about the villagers, who, ever since the meeting of the evening party
                     before described, suspected his motives and feared his designs. Not knowing
                     what evils he might bring upon them, and impelled by a very troublesome
                     curiosity, they imagined the worst, so naturally are we given to exaggeration;
                     and now began to refuse supplying him with the requisite comforts of life, thus
                     expecting to bring matters to a decisive point. This, at last, compelled him to
                     greater sociability, but he refused to become communicative. Though asked a
                     thousand times, directly and indirectly, concerning his solitary pursuits, he
                     had as many civil and respectful answers, leaving his questioners as ignorant
                     as they were before. At length, however, the curiosity of the village
                     triumphed. A young rogue, more cautious and cunning than the rest, ascertained
                     what were his employments, and smiled at the great consternation caused by the
                     discovery. He adorned his tale with all<pb n="110-111"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000056"/> the poetry of his rough fancy, and so interwove
                     it with marvels and falsehoods that it gave ample proof that he would have made
                     a much better alchemist than Felix. His story fully realized the imaginings of
                     the wildest magician, and soon succeeded in persuading the villagers that
                     Deford was the absolute controller of spirits, and the unlimited master of
                     demons. As a dealer in forbidden things, he was now still more carefully
                     avoided. Had Felix here thrown away his honesty, for he began to feel the
                     undeserved reputation he was acquiring, and issued from his cloister publicly
                     to practice his incantations, he could have performed wonders before the eyes
                     of the villagers not surpassed in splendor by any accredited to his masters:
                     but he preferred to continue his studies and his conjurations as if unconscious
                     of the opinions entertained concerning him. This only had the effect of
                     increasing the consternation of the villagers still more. His name at once
                     became an object of dread to the credulous, and a subject of terror to the old
                     women, who soon made it the fright of the nursery. Recollections of old and
                     marvelous stories were rapidly revived, and for some time nothing seemed to be
                     known or talked of in the village but terrible tales. There was scarcely a man
                     or woman to be found who had not recently seen a ghost or been troubled by some
                     fearful spectre, for all which Felix had to bear the blame. Amongst these, the
                     most conspicuous was the sharp-visaged old maid, who now saw more ghosts and
                     phantoms than there had been Gods in the heathen Pantheons, and pointed to this
                     fact as a full and triumphant verification of the opinions she had first
                     expressed concerning him. To billet an army upon a town is always attended with
                     great confusion, and necessarily with no little terror; but she accused him of
                     something more awful still. She unhesitatingly affirmed that he had filled the
                     village with spirits and devils, to trouble the repose of its people; but an
                     incredulous fellow, perhaps moved by a malicious disposition, insisted that
                     such could not possibly have been the case, otherwise she could not have been
                     secure for a single moment. No nook or corner could be found where ghost or
                     goblin had not been. The street had become the dancing ground of the tenants of
                     darkness, and the limits of the village the general theatre for their sports
                     and evil practices, and all through the incantations of the conjuror. Every
                     bare spot which had refused to yield as abundantly as its neighbor, brought a
                     curse upon poor Felix; every strange mark discovered was regarded as a sure
                     indication of superhuman agency, and every odd foot-print afforded a monstrous
                     theme for conjecture. Singular noises began to be heard in the air: some
                     exulting and merry—others plaintive and<pb n="112-113"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000057"/> melancholy. Confusion seized the cattle, the
                     horses became as stubborn as the women, the dogs kept up a continual howl and
                     fight, and night was rendered hideous by caterwauls. The pigs and chickens were
                     no less rebellious, the noisy fowls became more noisy and restless, and the
                     barn yards resembled perfect Babels. The crow of the cock was no longer the
                     morning signal of the approach of day, for it was heard at all hours of the
                     night. Everything seemed to have been turned upside down, or tossed about by
                     some miraculous and fearful power. It is supposed that the land inhabited by
                     spirits is pleasant and enchanting, that fairies and genii seek none but the
                     abodes of beauty, but here all was dismay. It was not strange that the majority
                     of the villagers should have been made afraid to venture out of doors after the
                     decline of the sun; yet notwithstanding all this, Felix had a few defenders.
                     Though none could deny the evidences of tumult existing, these assigned quite a
                     different cause for the fact. Make a village mad, said they, drive all the good
                     sense out of the heads of its women and substitute fear, spread consternation
                     amongst the children and discord amongst the men, and it would be truly
                     miraculous if matters followed their usually peaceful routine. The brute will
                     partake of the turbulent humors of its master, and when constantly disturbed by
                     surrounding dismay, cannotavoid becoming infected with the general
                     confusion.</p>
                  <p>Felix, at last, began to fear the mischief he had unintentionally been
                     creating, and sallied forth once a day with the view of allaying it. As secresy
                     was no longer possible, he endeavored to become as sociable and communicative
                     as circumstances would permit, but the villagers generally shunned him as
                     though he had been a pestilence. A few only could tolerate his presence and
                     submit to his conversations, and these had to encounter the censure of being
                     leagued with him. An evil motive and wicked intention was now ascribed to every
                     trifling thing he did, and all his attempts to commingle sociably with the
                     villagers were quickly attributed to some base design. It is strange how error
                     leads us to phrensy, but such appears to be its very nature. When once it has
                     taken root, it spreads and increases with unaccountable rapidity. With not one
                     half the beauty and attraction of truth and reason, it yet seems to possess a
                     hundred times their power and influence over our conduct. Truth moves with slow
                     and certain tread—error with fearful impetuosity. A town once set in motion the
                     wrong way, presents a terrific spectacle, and to arrest its career of madness
                     is a task not easily performed. It had been so in the case of Felix Deford, and
                     he soon ascertained that it was much less difficult to create a turbulent
                        storm<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6407-00000058"/> than to allay it. The
                     villagers became lavish in threats and curses against him; yet, mistrusting and
                     doubting, their fears compelled them to act with caution. Repeated deputations
                     were sent to him, politely requesting him to retire from the village, lest his
                     personal safety might be endangered. His efforts to remove their delusion
                     proved unavailing, and they continued to insist until he dismissed them, no
                     less impatient at their importunities than they had been apprehensive of his
                     residence amongst them.</p>
                  <p>Whilst they had been thus engaged in devising means for the expatriation of
                     Felix, a danger more immediately threatening called for their undivided
                     attention. Though it had been supposed they were entirely safe from Indian
                     incursions, they noticed several suspicious signs and indications which induced
                     them to prepare for an attack. The friendly feeling that had existed between
                     the villagers and the savages in their immediate vicinity, had not deterred
                     other tribes from ravaging wherever opportunities were presented. In this new
                     difficulty, the alchemist nobly volunteered his assistance. Without waiting for
                     such a call, he assumed the command as one familiar with the practices and
                     habits of the savage, and who had frequently been engaged in similar
                     skirmishes. As was apprehended, the warwhoop was suddenly heard early one
                     morning, and fully indicated the desperate encounter to be expected. The attack
                     was commenced with a fury common to Indian warfare, and it was mainly through
                     the vigilance of the magician that the contest resulted in the total rout of
                     the savages. All were compelled to be lavish in their praises of his services,
                     but even the marvellous exploits which they ascribed to him could not inspire
                     confidence and friendship. They were simply regarded as convincing proof of the
                     exercise of forbidden power. Upon being rehearsed again and again, no little
                     magnified at each repetition, few were willing to believe that he could have
                     escaped unless protected by some superhuman agency. Some had even seen strange
                     figures hovering above his head and arresting the many and repeated blows aimed
                     at him. Others had seen him surrounded by more than thirty savages at a time,
                     yet none of these could so closely approach him as to use any weapon. He
                     appeared to be encompassed by a mystic circle which no one could enter, thus
                     enabling him to deal destruction around, whilst his assailants were rendered
                     harmless. When tired of the slaughter in one section of the village, he almost
                     imperceptibly rose above the heads of friends and foes, and was quickly
                     transported to another that demanded his aid. Others, still, had seen him rush
                     wildly into the very midst of savage groups, and rescue a number of brave
                     villagers who had been defending themselves against great odds,<pb n="116-117"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000059"/> and so confusing the assailants that they even
                     fell upon themselves to hurry their retreat. The more marvellous his exploits,
                     the more did the villagers regret that he lived amongst them, for he might
                     eventually prove more dangerous than the savages themselves, and how could they
                     resist him?</p>
                  <p>Felix, however, was not disposed to be an object of dread to the villagers any
                     longer. A few days after the incursion of the Indians, he was no more to be
                     seen. To account for his sudden disappearance, it was alleged that he had
                     followed the savages, and would continue to pursue them until their tribe was
                     totally extinct. He was to become their evil spirit, who would enter into their
                     midst and slaughter as he pleased, whilst their arms should be unavailing
                     against him. This opinion obtained almost general consent as the most
                     plausible, after a careful and cautious examination of his late residence had
                     been made. Nothing was there to be found or seen save the black circle upon the
                     floor, which, to the great astonishment of all, resisted every effort made to
                     erase it. The walls were now more clear and clean than ever, and retained no
                     traces of the mysterious devices that had formerly ornamented them. The entire
                     building appeared as though it had been fitted up for the reception of some
                     fastidious tenant. All this, in the opinion of the villagers, had been the
                     undoubted work of the spirits which they supposed the conjuror had under his
                     command, and which would aid him in his avenging mission.</p>
                  <p>Their surmises were destined to be materially changed upon the arrival of one
                     of the villagers who had been absent for several months upon public business.
                     He was one of the principal men of the village, which important distinction he
                     had won more through the interest he had manifested against Felix than any
                     excellent qualities of his own. True, there was a little of the German's good
                     nature in his composition, and he had a great love for all that was wonderful
                     and mysterious. He heard with astonishment the details of the villagers—how
                     they had been attacked during his absence, and how Felix had assisted them, and
                     then suddenly departed, as they supposed, to take vengeance upon the savages.
                     In return, he had something interesting to relate, which soon undeceived them.
                     Whilst wending his solitary way towards the village, he reported, night had
                     overtaken him, and having been still a considerable distance off, he kindled a
                     fire upon the banks of the river, intending to repose until morning. Sometime
                     during the night he was aroused from his quiet slumber, and looking round, he
                     beheld a bright, blazing light in the air, high above the water. To his utter
                     amazement, there was Felix Deford in the blaze! He was vehemently
                        remonstrating<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6407-00000060"/> strating with a
                     figure so closely arrayed in black that its outlines could not be distinctly
                     traced. The discussion continued sharply for some time. Although circumstances
                     sufficiently indicated that Felix was in the presence of a superior, his spirit
                     was unconquerable, and he ever seemed the victor in the wordy conflict, as the
                     villager inferred from the manner of his antagonist. The black figure continued
                     to become more terrible at every word, and at last began emitting foam from its
                     mouth and fire from its nostrils, but Felix refused to abate the least in his
                     remonstrances. A different encounter now commenced between them, which promised
                     to be more decisive than words. The blaze that enveloped them began to spread
                     and heave as though it partook of the anger of the combatants, much resembling
                     huge and boisterous billows when dashed into spray in quick succession against
                     an irresistible rock. It seemed to have been caught up in a terrible tempest,
                     and amid its turbulent agitation, the contest between Felix and his antagonist
                     was continued by rapidly hurling large black darts at each other. No want of
                     skilful aim was exhibited, yet each appeared to be composed of an impenetrable
                     substance, and the destructive missiles no sooner touched the person of either
                     than they rebounded again, or flew off at angles, and vanished into air.
                     Abandoning these apparently inefficient instruments, they approached, and
                     engaged hand to hand with fiery swords; but so equally were they matched in
                     this mode of warfare that they only exhausted themselves, and after making a
                     number of furious, but ineffectual blows and thrusts, they threw away their
                     weapons. Panting from the exertion of the desperate battle, they stood for some
                     time gazing intently at each other, exhibiting a fearful and unearthly
                     savageness. At length the contest was again resumed, and huge bolts, whose
                     dark-blue color contrasted beautifully with the glare that surrounded them,
                     were thrown with marvellous dexterity, but they were as vigilantly and
                     skilfully parried or avoided. It was now as difficult to be true to their aim
                     as it had been easy before, plainly indicating that a blow from the bolt was
                     held in different esteem than a stroke from the darts previously used. Suddenly
                     Felix sprang with a savage leap upon his antagonist, having at the same moment
                     been struck by one of these monstrous missiles, when instantly the flame
                     disappeared, and both fell rapidly down into the water. Nothing was now heard
                     but the rushing of the current, which seemed to have become more boisterous,
                     and the villager composed himself to sleep again.</p>
                  <p>He awoke in the morning, and directing his eyes over the body of the water, he
                     beheld rapid currents from all sides, rushing towards the spot where the
                        combatants<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6407-00000061"/> had fallen. The object
                     was strange to him, and he entered his light canoe determined to investigate
                     it. Fortunately for his curiosity, before he reached the ungovernable current,
                     he saw the trunk of a large tree floating down the river. It was drawn towards
                     the arena that had attracted his attention, and rapidly approaching the centre.
                     It was whirled round and round, tearing up the water as if laboring in a mighty
                     whirlwind, or grappling to be freed from the clutch of a fearful monster. Its
                     terrible struggles were unavailing, and by a powerful effort, as though the
                     might of the waters had been concentrated upon one object, it was raised on
                     end, when down, down it passed from sight. This new wonder was scarcely less
                     surprising to the villager than the occurrences he had witnessed during the
                     night, and guarding his fragile bark he for some time watched the raging
                     element. Every thing that came within reach of the current, which had formed
                     itself into a great funnel, was dragged down its voracious centre, however
                     awful or prolonged its struggles. What became of it afterwards ever remained a
                     close and impenetrable mystery.</p>
                  <p>After this astonishing report had been heard and fully commented upon by the
                     villagers, all other surmises in reference to Felix were abandoned, and many
                     visited the place where he had fought his last battle. There was none now to be
                     found amongst them who had no regrets for the poor alchemist. Although he had
                     been an object of fear to them whilst seen in their midst, he had rendered
                     services too important when the village had been assailed by the savages, not
                     to have secured the good wishes of all; and if they had so heartily desired him
                     to remove his abode elsewhere, they as fervently wished prosperity to attend
                     him. Even the sharp-visaged old maid, who had before so repeatedly expressed
                     her ill opinion of him, now exhibited her gratitude. During the assault of the
                     Indians, she affirmed, he had twice rescued her from the tomahawk of the
                     savages just in time to prevent the blows that would certainly have terminated
                     her existence. With all her want of charity and magnanimity, there was still
                     the sweet tenderness of woman in her nature, and she could not restrain her
                     lamentations and her tears.</p>
                  <p>For a long, long time, the story of Felix continued to be the village talk. The
                     strange disposition of the waters that commemorated his last exploit, acquired
                     the name of the "Magic Funnel" from the villagers, and whatever was drawn into
                     it was engulfed forever. Its end or termination remained unknown. It was a
                     suggestion of some of the more philosophic villagers, that the immense currents
                     which then fed it may have<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6407-00000062"/> entered
                     again into the body of the river at a distance of many miles, or have had a
                     number of outlets so small that none would have thought of tracing them to
                     their original source. Whatever of truth or error there may have been in these
                     and kindred surmises, it is said, as a truth which was never doubted by the
                     villagers, that the poor and ill-fated alchemist makes a circuit every year,
                     entering the "Magic Funnel" again, together with his antagonist. On every
                     anniversary of his fearful encounter, the singular flame may be seen again in
                     the air, with a renewal of the battle. Often these waters lash each other as if
                     in great trouble, and it has passed into a traditional saying with the sturdy

                     impetuosity, that the conjuror and his powerful adversary are at each other
                     again, interchanging their terrible frowns and hurling their fearful bolts. The
                     humble boatman, as he cautiously moves by this mysterious place, now far less
                     dangerous than many years ago, with his fragile skiff or light canoe, still
                     gives a sighing thought to the memory of the conjuror, and not unfrequently
                     sings a doleful requiem over the fate of the Village Alchemist.</p>

                  <head type="sub">INTENDED TO PRECEDE THE FOLLOWING ESSAY.</head>
                  <p>"IF, in the paper herewith, submitted, there may be any confusion, or supposed
                     misapplication of terms, we claim our privilege. In old time, those who
                     excelled in the sciences were called <hi rend="i"/>Sages, which was equivalent
                     to our <hi rend="i"/>learned. This pedantic appellation, however, could not be
                     tolerated by the modest Pythagoras, who, being merely an anxious searcher after
                     knowledge, refused to arrogate to himself its actual possession, and therefore
                     assumed the title of <hi rend="i"/>Philosopher, or <hi rend="i"/>Lover of
                     Wisdom. He deserves immortal honor for this happy application of the word, yet
                     we are not quite sure that he would have used it at all had he foreseen the
                     consequences to which it has led. Ever since his day, it has become the custom
                     to look upon all whose wild fancies are inexplicable, as "Philosophers;" and
                     whenever a confused mass of nonsense is collected together, so heterogeneous
                     that human ingenuity is at a loss to classify it, it is generally dubbed
                     "Philosophy." Whatever of incongruity, confusion, or misapplication may be
                     detected in our essay, must, therefore, under the most approved customs of the
                     times, be regarded as wonderfully philosophic, and being thus converted into a
                     merit, we need add nothing in extenuation."</p>

                  <head>AN ESSAY.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE BEAUTY OF A WELL CULTIVATED HEART.</head>
                  <p>HOWEVER high and exalted the achievements of mind, and whatever the pleasures
                     and consolations of knowledge, these are small when contrasted with the
                     beauties of a well-cultivated heart. The grand attainments of talent and
                     genius, exhibiting man's lofty superiority over all animated existence, may
                     attract our admiration and elicit our surprise, but the manifestation of those
                     noble qualities which we ascribe to the heart, alone can make us feel. Mind
                     only appeals to mind: heart alone to heart.</p>
                  <p>"Knowledge is wealth," was a favorite and perhaps somewhat egotistical saying
                     of the ancient philosophers, and, indeed, without it man would be a most
                     pitiable creature. It is a maxim ascribed to Zoroaster, that "he who lives in
                     ignorance knoweth<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6407-00000064"/> neither God nor
                     religion," and Thales, one of the seven wise men of Greece, and founder of the
                     Ionic sect, calls him "who enjoys good health, finds fortune favorable, and has
                     well cultivated his soul with sound learning," the happy man. Without, mental
                     culture, we cannot appreciate the treasures of nature, and unless we have a
                     knowledge of its laws, obtained through a study of the sciences, we cannot
                     realize the comforts with which it is arrayed for the benefit of mankind. Even
                     the merciful government of God is rendered one of terror and fear through
                     ignorance, whilst the intercourse with our fellows so essential to social
                     happiness, is restrained within the most narrow bounds, and we remain little
                     better than barbarians. The Mitylenians esteemed ignorance of the liberal arts
                     a deplorable punishment, and thus, when masters of the sea, they prohibited the
                     revolted allies from teaching their children letters or music, as the most
                     grievous penalty they could possibly inflict.</p>
                  <p>The affections, and those virtues which signally reach them, we have for ages
                     been accustomed to place to the heart's account. "We yield to it all the
                     virtues of sensibility, and thus it becomes the great source and centre of
                     feeling. To it we ascribe that generous commiseration and sympathy which
                     constitute the pillars of society, and which have long since confirmed the
                     declaration of the great Roman orator, that no nation has ever existed where
                     civility, good nature, and gratitude, were not had in esteem, and where the
                     proud, the mischievous, the cruel, and ungrateful, were not had in contempt and
                     abhorrence. Wisdom may flatter our self-love, and as it advances, justly
                     challenge our respect, but we fail to see in it the power or the pleasure which
                     is inseparable from the heart's good sentiments. "It is to no purpose to be
                     wise, unless we are rendered better," truly observes Lucian. Life is made a
                     blessing, not through the influence of mind, however much it may have done to
                     surround us with the means of comfort and enjoyment, but through the great
                     excellencies of man's nature. It is a law of nature, as we are told by the most
                     eminent moralists, that each should cultivate an agreeable sociability as the
                     best means of promoting the end for which human society has been instituted.
                     This can never be successfully done without the virtues of the heart—such as
                     friendship and love, and above and including all, CHARITY.</p>
                  <p>The pleasure of man's intercourse with his fellows depends principally upon the
                     virtues that adorn him. The wise, if arrogant, vain, and ungrateful, may only
                     succeed in awakening within the good feelings of mingled respect and contempt;
                     whilst the generous, the humble, the just, will ever elicit universal esteem.
                        We<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6407-00000065"/> rely upon their gratitude and
                     confide in their friendship, realizing the happiness of their guileless
                     sincerity and truth. Without friendship, life would be a gift which we might
                     well despise. "By what other means," asks Seneca, "are we preserved, but by the
                     mutual assistance of good turns?" It is this generous virtue, springing from
                     the heart, that renders our associations agreeable, and throws around our
                     existence the joys and pleasures of social life. "If any man," says Xenophon,
                     "a lover of virtue, ever found a more profitable companion than Socrates, I
                     deem that man the happiest of human kind." This celebrated ancient general and
                     scholar, in thus speaking of his friend, utters but a truthful tribute to the
                     virtue of friendship, as exemplified in the life of every honest man.</p>
                  <p>The man who has well improved his heart becomes a fit companion for all,
                     whatever may be their condition. He views the actions of men through the medium
                     of his generous virtues, rather than through that rigid severity which
                     accompanies an unforgiving temper. His noble charity recognizes a universal
                     equality, and whilst he bears with the errors and follies of those around him,
                     he seeks to remove them by generous appeals to the heart rather than by censure
                     and rough rebuke. He remembers that the tender entreaties of his mother, and
                     the lamentations of his wife and children dren, prevented Coriolanus from
                     destroying the Rome that had formerly banished him, and not the fear of the
                     Romans nor their tempting overtures; and that afterwards the moderation of
                     Valerius Corvus, the Dictator, quelled a dangerous mutiny, and accomplished,
                     perhaps a similar end. He is not prone to look upon every error as a serious
                     crime to be resented, but prefers to act upon the magnanimous dictum accredited
                     to the Chinese philosophers, who "reckoned it a true mark of a brave, and wise,
                     and worthy man, to put up the hurts and affronts he received, without any
                     inclination to harm the author." When it becomes necessary to punish a villain,
                     he prefers the example of Pericles, if circumstances allow it, who, it is said,
                     endured the ribaldry of a rogue for an entire day, without exhibiting anger,
                     and then commanded a servant to light him home with the torch: thus, perhaps,
                     taking the most signal vengeance possible, for none can patiently bear such
                     generosity and silence from him whom he hates, and with whom he desires to
                     quarrel. In the wide range of human blessings there is none to equal those
                     generous impulses which govern the conduct of such a man. They enable him truly
                     to fulfil the destiny of his affections, in whatever station he may be called,
                     despite the circumstances calculated to arouse his passions and excite the evil
                     elements in his nature.</p>
                  <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6407-00000066"/>
                  <p>They who have well cultivated the heart's true sensibilities, find the means
                     and sources of enjoyment spread lavishly around them. The fickle and whimsical
                     pursuits after momentary pleasure, which vex and perplex so many, never disturb
                     their quiet nor encumber their repose. The happiness that attends them is
                     unalloyed, not subject to the regrets of disappointment, nor the frequent
                     remorse which preys upon the mind of him who had haunted the glittering
                     pleasures of animal life and its enticing enjoyments. They feel the full
                     gratification of the inward sense, which is sincere, penetrating, and
                     permanent. The store upon which they draw is exhaustless. Other elements of
                     nature may perish by too frequent use, but the sensibilities of the heart only
                     increase in strength and vigor through every occasion that calls them forth,
                     and expand the more the more they are exercised. It is use that preserves them:
                     slothfulness is their great and formidable enemy. "All virtues," says an
                     ancient Grecian philosopher, "depend upon exercise and use; to preserve them,
                     we must practice them."</p>
                  <p>The career of man often presents melancholy illustrations of the want of this
                     true sensibility. The aims of life, too frequently governed by the arbitrary
                     decrees of society, lead him into paths that rather blunt than encourage it;
                     and he finds little substantial pleasure in fulfilling a destiny which
                     circumstances have forced upon him against the better qualities of his nature.
                     Fortune may have smiled upon him, enriching him with her bounties, yet these,
                     if simply depending upon themselves, soon sicken and lose their interest. The
                     riches of the soul can only be enjoyed through the sensibilities of the heart,
                     which lead us to the performance of deeds of truth and charity. They alone can
                     enable us to discharge the mission of sympathy and love towards the unfortunate
                     and distressed; they alone can qualify us for generous and magnanimous
                     intercourse with those whose evil destiny deserves our kind indulgence, and fit
                     us for more exalted association with equals and superiors; they alone can
                     develope the good germs in our nature into exceeding excellencies, and lead us
                     to true virtue and its exhaustless treasures; and they alone can make the
                     journey of life resemble a smooth and even surface, and surround us with
                     pleasures and comforts which the insensible may never know. How much, then, is
                     it our duty to cultivate the heart through the exercise of its sensibilities,
                     and thus obtain the full gratification of every virtuous faculty in our nature!
                     How much, then, does it behoove each of us to conquer the sordid and selfish
                     motives too frequently engendered by surrounding influences, and bring into
                     more healthful existence those<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6407-00000067"/> noble
                     affections with which we are endowed! Thus alone can we truly live in mind and
                     heart, and effect a happy harmony between soul and body—no longer verifying the
                     saying of Theophrastus, that the former pays large rent to the latter for its
                     dwelling.</p>

                  <head type="sub">MADE BY THE SECRETARY.</head>
                  <p>THE following paper was read at a full meeting of the Junto, and listened to
                     with considerable attention: not more than a dozen falling into a nodding doze
                     during its reading. I was at a loss to account for this interest, not knowing
                     whether to ascribe it to the style of the composition or to the manner of the
                     reader, who frequently indicated his delight, though perhaps at the expense of
                     his charity, by his insinuating emphasis of particular sentences. To be
                     relieved of my perplexity, I addressed the inquiry to a gentleman seated near
                     me, upon whose face I noticed a savage scowl, which had probably been
                     occasioned by his having heard too accurate a description of his own character.
                     Turning towards me, perhaps with the view of ascertaining whether there was not
                     a double meaning in my query, he gruffly replied: "Neither style nor manner;
                     but scandal, to be sure: the drowsiest cur will prick its ears at scandal—the
                     sluggard, be he never so sluggish, never gapes when furnished with a dish well
                     seasoned with its venom." That he was correct in this, I shall not here venture
                     to record an opinion;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6407-00000068"/> but certain it
                     is, that at the conclusion he was the loudest in applause of Peter's dream, and
                     the first to declare that "it was not all a dream." Notwithstanding this
                     emphatic declaration, however, it was soon ascertained, upon questioning the
                     gentleman who had introduced the paper, that it was, of a verity, what it
                     purported to be. He had received the manuscript of a friend, who had heard
                     every incident therein related from Peter Easy himself, and could not be
                     mistaken. This seemed to satisfy the curiosity of each, and it was therefore
                     generously decreed that the "Dream of a Loafer" should be allowed a place
                     amongst the records of the Association.</p>

                  <head>THE DREAM OF A LOAFER.</head>
                  <p>IT has often been matter of surprise to me, that the important and truly
                     philosophic individual upon whom the community has generously conferred the
                     title of "loafer," should frequently be so little appreciated as to receive no
                     higher encomiums than such as he may be able to extract from a laugh or a
                     sneer. His title is certainly one of dignity and distinction, and although many
                     efforts have heretofore been made to change it, and substitute the more refined
                     and aristocratic appellation of "gentleman of leisure," he has ever, and very
                     properly, in my opinion, indignantly resisted such invidious encroachments upon
                     it. He has thoroughly examined its derivation, and fully investigated its
                     import, with all of which he has no reason to find fault, and therefore remains
                     perfectly content.</p>
                  <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6407-00000069"/>
                  <p>That the loafer is a meritorious personage, one fact alone should be sufficient
                     to satisfy the most doubting: he is always emphatically a "self-made" man. By
                     carefully studying excellent examples, which have been increasing ever since
                     the world began, and to which we are promised many more bright additions, he
                     seldom fails to attain a great degree of perfection. Unfortunately, our
                     civilization prevents him from securing that renown to which he is fully able
                     to establish a just claim, and which had generally been freely granted to his
                     first predecessors. Should he presume to live, as it is reported of our
                     primitive ancestors, upon husks and acorns, we would quickly pronounce him a
                     madman, if for no other reason than because this would demonstrate that he
                     differed from us in taste, or was blessed with a better organ of digestion!
                     Should he diet upon raw beef, employ his naked fingers and the hollow of his
                     hand in preference to the many table articles invented for our convenience, and
                     now constantly used, we would soon think it an act of charity to confine him in
                     some lunatic asylum, instead of immortalizing him as a philosopher!
                     Civilization, so much admired for the many comforts it has brought with it, has
                     thus resulted much more to his injury than benefit. If the dial of time was set
                     back some two or three thousand years he is perhaps the only one who would not
                     lose by the change. In truth, civilization and enlightenment, though he does
                     not deny that they have greatly benefitted others, are his most formidable
                     enemies. It will therefore be seen how unreasonable and ungenerous are those
                     who condemn him for doing nothing to advance either. These elements of modern
                     society have been the great cause of inducing many to doubt his usefulness,
                     whilst they have even impelled some seriously to question the necessity of his
                     existence. In proof of this, I may here state, that I once had a very
                     inquisitive and philosophic friend, now for several years gathered to his
                     fathers, whose death, it is said, was occasioned by too close mental
                     application in efforts to ascertain the usefulness and necessity of a
                     well-known micher, who was constantly to be seen at the village tavern. Such, I
                     have been assured, was the precise statement of his physician, who likewise
                     added, that he might perhaps have survived, but for the many perplexing
                     difficulties suggested to his mind by the old command of the apostle, "that if
                     any would not work, neither should he eat." This entire statement, however, was
                     much questioned; but then, those who doubted it, invariably remarked that the
                     doctor, having so well doctored my friend that he quickly died, had less regard
                     for the truth than solicitude for his professional<pb n="138-139"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000070"/> skill. This involves the whole matter in
                     uncertainty, where I must leave it, not because I belong to the school of the
                     Pyrrhonists, those lying doubters of old, but simply because the subject is too
                     intricate, and might perhaps prove as fatal to me as the one before alluded to
                     did to my worthy friend. Whatever may have been the cause of my friend's death,
                     we must feel sorry that, if he was engaged upon so serviceable a work, he was
                     not permitted to complete it and present the result of his labors to the world.
                     The information might have proved of considerable benefit to the
                     philosophically inclined. Indeed, if he had removed all possible doubt of the
                     usefulness of such individuals, and shown the real necessity of their existence
                     in our society, a very difficult problem, I must own, would have been solved.
                     Such a favorable solution, too, would have afforded much consolation to all of
                     that class, and might even have caused a great increase of their number. Of one
                     thing, at least, I am certain: it would have confirmed still more, if such a
                     thing be possible, the habits of an acquaintance of mine, who resides in the
                     same village with me. He is known to the villagers by the designation of Easy
                     Peter, but always writes his name, whenever you can induce him to perform so
                     much manual labor, PETER EASY. He is descended from a family whose lineage has
                     been traced to the Welsh and Germans, of which stocks he is extremely fond of
                     boasting. This, to me, seems simply to illustrate an excellent trait in his
                     character, for it exhibits the respect he entertains for his forefathers. Some
                     of the villagers, however, ascribe his boasts to vanity; declaring that he is
                     as vain as a woman, and that if mythology had no Narcissus, he would furnish it
                     with an excellent one. That these are much out in their reckoning, I am well
                     persuaded; for should he become so enchanted with the loveliness of his figure
                     as to languish to death at the fountain in which it might be reflected, they
                     would be the first to attribute his demise to sheer laziness,—a disease, which,
                     fortunately, is not very fatal, otherwise epidemics would never cease in the
                     world.</p>
                  <p>Easy Peter may at all times be seen in our village. If he is not found at the
                     old log tavern at its eastern end, you are certain to meet him at the tobacco
                     house at its western extremity, where two smoky youths have for several years
                     been engaged in "rolling up" the weed into form for the enjoyment of its
                     devotees. I believe it is the universal experience that all of Peter's
                     excellent habits possess a great proclivity for places of this kind. Whether
                     this may be owing to a desire for idle associations, or simply<pb n="140-141"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000071"/> to a love of the articles retailed there, I am
                     not well qualified to decide; but whatever may be the cause operating upon
                     Peter, he has a peculiar affinity for these two places in our village, at which
                     his enthusiasm and verbosity frequently amuse and occasionally astonish his
                     auditors. It is true, no one seriously apprehends that any modern Festus will
                     ever impatiently accuse him of being made mad by "much learning," however
                     prolific he may be in his speeches. He is in no such danger, nor is it probable
                     that he will ever earn the reputation of being wise simply through being
                     boisterous, although many have done so before him. Always referring to the
                     generous liberality ascribed to Socrates as an illustration how men should use
                     their knowledge, he even seeks to surpass this much renowned ancient
                     philosopher, whom he recognizes as his worthy model, in the lavishness with
                     which he dispenses whatever he may happen to know. This, it must be
                     acknowledged, is not so exceedingly much; but then he always mixes it with a
                     marvellous amount of useless verbiage, principally drawn from his imagination
                     and his dreams. Herein, it will readily be conceded, he is not at all singular,
                     and only plays a part for which the times furnish innumerable examples. The
                     inhabitants of the village are all perfectly acquainted with him and his
                     habits, and he has therefore long since ceased to disturb them, not from any
                     reasons of his own, but simply because they have learned not to heed him. It so
                     happens, however, that we are not unfrequently visited by strangers, and these
                     invariably stare with amazement whenever they encounter him at either of his
                     favorite places of resort. It may be supposed that in these magnanimous efforts
                     to entertain all who can be induced, from curiosity or other motives, to while
                     away an idle moment with him, he should naturally indulge in denunciations
                     against the world and its practices. This, I must confess, is an inference not
                     in the least repugnant to his habits; but then he never finds fault from the
                     mere pleasure of doing so, in which he is so very singular, that I must leave
                     it to others to determine whether he is in advance of the age or behind it.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the hour of noon, on a certain summer day which will long be
                     remembered in this locality because of its excessive heat, a young and
                     sprightly farmer chanced to visit the village. His entrance seemed to be
                     regarded as an event somewhat remarkable, for so dull was the season that no
                     strange face had been seen by the villagers for several weeks. Upon arriving at
                     the tavern, having been curiously stared at by the occupants of every building
                     he had passed, he encountered Peter, who immediately entered<pb n="142-143"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000072"/> into heterogeneous conversation, if that can be
                     called conversation in which the talking is all on one side. I will here
                     venture the opinion, though cautiously, that it may, for custom seems to have
                     so decreed, and with few things has custom had more to do. Having invented no
                     new word fully adequate to the occasion, and sufficiently expressive, we are
                     led to submit to its long continued acquiescence in the one now employed. Then,
                     too, excellent talkers could never consent to change this form of expression
                     for any other less creditable to themselves, and the good listener may find
                     sufficient to reconcile himself to it in the remark of old Simonides, who
                     declared that he had frequently repented of having said too much, but never of
                     having remained silent. Notwithstanding the apparent determination to exclude
                     the possibility of a stray word from the new comer, Peter's conduct had
                     something of novelty in it to the stranger which at once induced him patiently
                     to listen. Of course, this attention was highly pleasing to the talker, for
                     several weeks had been a very long period for him to remain, on account of the
                     dullness of the season, in that silence to which the villagers had doomed him
                     by common consent, under the impression that time spent with him was
                     unprofitably and irretrievably cast away. When, therefore, he was invited by
                     the young man to a seat in his conveyance, Peter had no hesitancy in accepting,
                     and not until they had left the village several miles behind, did he ascertain
                     that the stranger had no intention of returning to it again. He now first
                     bethought himself of the ridiculous blunder he had made in not having informed
                     himself of this fact before. In this sad plight, very sad indeed to him, he
                     slowly dismounted from the vehicle, and commenced pondering upon the best means
                     to get back again to the tavern he had so incautiously left at the bidding of
                     the stranger. To walk so great a distance he would at any time have looked upon
                     as an exceedingly laborious task, but in the awful heat of that day the idea
                     was too terrible to be entertained. At length he concluded to trust to his
                     luck, which had sometimes favored him, although he had frequently complained of
                     its hard decrees, thinking that chance might perhaps send some conveyance that
                     way, through which he could return to the village. I should be greatly
                     gratified to be able to say, that in Peter Easy I had found the man who never
                     lamented over his fate, and who never affirmed that he was the "unluckiest
                     fellow in the world;" but I cannot claim the credit of having made so happy a
                     discovery. Whether that fortunate individual has ever set a foot of real flesh
                     and bone upon earthly soil, is most extremely doubtful; yet all will confide in
                     their better<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6407-00000073"/> destiny, as did Peter
                     in the present instance, though the certainty of disappointment may seem to
                     stare them in the face. Cheered by so comfortable a hope, he seated himself by
                     the roadside, beneath the shady branches of a ponderous tree, and not feeling
                     just then like the young lady who always "dreaded to retire to bed because she
                     could not talk in her sleep," he was soon lazily spread out full length upon
                     the sod. He had not been long in this posture, before he found gradually
                     stealing over him a dull and oppressive stupor, which may have owed its origin
                     to a hearty and undigested dinner, for in his case the saying of the wise man
                     did not yet apply—"slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul
                     shall suffer hunger," Fortunately for him, his father had been a careful and
                     judicious man, and thus placed him beyond the calamity of the latter portion of
                     the proverb, which his habits might otherwise have reaped; and I much question
                     whether he had ever been so blessed as to realize the truth of the former by
                     experience. In this state of unconsciousness, verging unto sleep, he had a
                     dream, which he has since so often related that it must be very widely known.
                     At least, such is the inference of the villagers, who suppose that it has been
                     honored with frequent repetitions by some of the many strangers who have
                     visited the village since this eventful day in Peter's life, none of whom could
                     escape hearing it either in whole or by parcels. I shall here endeavor to
                     narrate it, though conscious that much of its effect must necessarily be lost
                     through the absence of his manner and gestures, which no human skill could
                     transfer upon paper; nor can I give it precisely in his own words, for reasons
                     which I must withhold, leaving the reader, however, at liberty to supply such
                     as may best suit his fancy.</p>
                  <p>Easy Peter, not so exceedingly easy at the time, imagined in his dream that
                     some supernatural power had suddenly seized him. From whence it had come, he
                     could not divine, but it gradually transported him beyond the confines of earth
                     into another world. This so much resembled our own, that had he awoke here, he
                     positively affirms, he should not have been able to discover the least
                     difference. He was not as fortunate as the man who "dreamed that there was no
                     credit to be given to dreams;" and strange enough, in his conscious hours, he
                     defends this fanciful excursion of his momentary slumber as a substantial
                     truth. It has been so effectually impressed upon his mind, that he speaks of
                     it, not as the deceptive experience of a dream, but as a real adventure. The
                     first thing that attracted his attention in this new sphere, was the variety of
                     employments at which he found the people<pb n="146-147"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000074"/> engaged. A French philosopher declares, that
                     they are mean souls who are so buried in business as not to know that the most
                     glorious and principal work of man is to live well; and as Peter gazed upon the
                     continual efforts and ceaseless struggles here exhibited, he could not refrain
                     from indulging in somewhat similar reflections. Scarcely an occasional pause
                     was to be observed in the general commotion, so intent did each appear upon
                     some object that hurried him on.—Amongst these eager scramblers, running to and
                     fro in hot haste, chasing every chimera supposed to hold out a promise, Peter's
                     eyes detected one who at once claimed his entire attention. He was as ugly as a
                     Theban sphynx, lean and lank, his very gait giving evidence of his cunning and
                     treachery, whilst his countenance, if it mirrored what was passing in the soul,
                     plainly cried out, "Money, money! at whatever cost or consequence, I must have
                     money!" A worthy illustration of the heartless miser, who seeks for nothing but
                     the gratification of his insatiable desire, he never hesitated to inflict a
                     wrong, or crush a soul, to obtain possession of a shilling. The French
                     Vandille, to save the extra expense of three bleedings at three pence each, let
                     out the four and twenty ounces of blood at a single operation, thus purchasing
                     his death at a sixpence—certainly a very cheap transaction. He had his
                     counterpart in this avaricious wretch, who, Peter positively affirms, would
                     have added another four and twenty ounces for the gratification of feasting his
                     eyes upon the glitter of a shekel. "Had he lived," said a stranger, "in the
                     days of Eumolpus, he would have been an excellent subject for remembrance in
                     the will of that whimsical fellow, who ordered that all to whom he gave
                     legacies, besides his children, should receive them upon condition that they
                     cut up his body and eat it before the people." "Many," replied Peter, "have
                     waded through disgust to wealth; and for a trifle, he would never have paused
                     until he had munched it up entirely." His miserly propensities urged him to the
                     violation of every principle, the sacrifice of every virtue that happened to
                     come in contact with them; and thus he pursued his daily course, still adding
                     to his store as he lost of his manhood. How very ridiculous it is, thought
                     Peter in his dream, that men will grasp and grasp without stopping to ask a
                     question, and thereby only increase the certainty of being eventually grasped
                     themselves, by most unwelcome clutches, without being allowed the time to
                     answer any.</p>
                  <p>Turning from this wretched specimen of humanity, Peter recognised another who
                     was no less busy, and who seemed as ambitious as Phton or Icarus, determined<pb
                        n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6407-00000075"/> mined to set the world in a blaze,
                     or what appeared more likely to happen, break his own neck in his aspiring
                     flights. He knew of no medium by which to be controlled, and would even have
                     found pleasure in the reputation of being a fool; but, unfortunately, Hobbes
                     spoke truth when he said, that "without learning it is impossible for any man
                     to be either excellently wise or excellently foolish." Herein he was deficient,
                     and the "number of common fools far exceeding that of wise men," as a German
                     author observes, they were rendered so general and were so frequently
                     encountered that even this prospect of securing celebrity promised him nothing.
                     Moved by his "wild distemper" he forgot the realities by which he was
                     surrounded, and in his impetuosity to climb up the crooked ladder of
                     distinction, he was hurried to the most extravagant excesses. Erostratus, to
                     obtain renown, fired the temple of Diana, but the Ephesians, to bury his memory
                     in eternal oblivion, prohibited the mention of his name under the penalty of
                     death. This individual, if not yet driven to such extremities to gratify his
                     passion, could nevertheless foresee, in the satiric ridicule certain to follow
                     his mad endeavors, sufficient cause to "go and hang himself out of sheer
                     mortification." Such, thought Peter, not unfrequently, is the melancholy end of
                     the zealot, when his zeal triumphs over his judgment and dethrones his
                     reason.</p>
                  <p>As he was watching the manœuvres and expedients of this not uncommon character,
                     a party of gentlemen suddenly intervened between his vision and the subject of
                     his gaze. They were all so exceedingly merry that Peter felt anxious to join in
                     their sport, and declares that he should have done so had he not been deterred
                     by seeing one of them slyly and skilfully sliding his hands into the pockets of
                     another, where, he quite reasonably supposed, it had no business. This was an
                     exploit the like of which he had never witnessed before; but having frequently
                     heard of the practices of a learned profession, he immediately concluded that
                     this cunning villain was a lawyer, so prone are we to form opinions from
                     general, reputation. He soon after discovered his error, however, for the loud
                     "hue and cry" that met his ears, very distinctly informed him that upon this
                     world there were pocket pickers and robbers as well as upon our own, showing
                     that we cannot claim these blessings as belonging exclusively to us. Inference,
                     thought Peter, is a very uncertain thing, as often unjust as it is mistaken,
                     and he asked of himself whether it had ever assigned to him a place in the
                     category of rogues. Of this he might have been satisfied, for it has not yet
                     been shown that any has ever escaped such imputations, and we can only be
                     surprised that so many are foolish enough<pb n="150-151"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000076"/> to manifest doubtful anxiety in a matter of
                     which each may be so certain.</p>
                  <p>Another, who was hurrying along with all possible speed, and whose wild
                     appearance seemed to attract general notice, now claimed Peter's attention. Not
                     in the least regarding his late experience, he at once concluded that this was
                     a madman, in which he was again partially mistaken. Following after, it was not
                     long before he discovered him to be an eminent physician, visiting a patient to
                     whom he had the day before administered a dose, and who was now in his last
                     agonies. "A wretched, bungling quack! a quack, sir," exclaimed a young
                     physician, who became irritated at our dreamer as he was declaiming upon this
                     portion of his dream. "Perhaps," replied a stranger, "the people of that sphere
                     are stupid enough to follow the practice that caused the uncivil jest of Fabius
                     of Bentivoglio, who, on his way to manufacture a doctor, by chance espied an
                     ass yawning with open mouth as if he were laughing. To whom, 'why laugh you,'
                     says Fabius, 'you silly creature? we can make you a doctor too, if you have but
                     money.'" However this may have been, the great haste of the physician was
                     matter of surprise to Peter, who could not understand why a professor, whose
                     business it was to assist people to get out of the world with ease, should be
                     so much concerned for the life of a single patient. His wonder, however, soon
                     subsided upon being furnished with reason to believe that the man of medicine
                     was a more careful student of the Talmud and the Rabbins than of his
                     profession, and that he had not been running for the good of the sick, but for
                     his own fee, which was of infinitely greater importance. Many a one, thought
                     Peter, is rendering service to the devil, even at the very time that we may
                     think him engaged in works of superior excellence.</p>
                  <p>Easy Peter now lost sight of the physician, but his place was filled by a
                     straight, slender, and serious looking individual, who was holding forth in a
                     magnificent building, which had evidently been erected with a due regard to
                     lodging accommodations. It required nothing beyond what he saw to inform him
                     that this was a preacher in his fashionable temple. Peter had seen few men,
                     notwithstanding his extensive intercourse with the world, who had the faculty
                     of assuming so saintly an appearance as this one, and he therefore determined
                     to follow him home. The holy man had scarcely descended from the pulpit before
                     Peter saw an illustration of how much easier it was to preach humility than to
                     practice it, and felt how few, even of the priesthood, really understood the
                     saying of the essayist, that "the souls of kings and<pb n="152-153"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000077"/> cobblers were cast in the same mould." To show
                     obeisance to the one, however guilty and degraded by vice he may be, is easy,
                     and honorable, and an imitation of Jesus: to shake hands with the other, and
                     seek to reclaim him by magnanimous and friendly fellowship, is countenancing
                     and encouraging "publicans and sinners." To greet with the pleasant social
                     smile, and the exhibition of generous solicitude, the poor and ragged
                     parishioner, is changing religion into levity, and "walking in the counsel of
                     the ungodly, and standing in the way of sinners:" to fawn upon and court the
                     favor and association of the more fortunate worshipper, who seldom ever rises
                     from his knees until he has planned some new scheme to play the villain towards
                     his fellow, is "exhorting one another daily, while it is called to-day," or
                     taking "sweet counsel together, and walking unto the house of God in company."
                     Peter was not a little surprised, upon reaching the residence of the minister,
                     to discover how much better he was fitted to declaim upon the beauties of
                     charity than to practice magnanimity and forbearance in his own house. This,
                     thought he, is not the only one who, to obtain skill in lecturing the public,
                     exercises himself at the expense of his family's comfort and happiness.</p>
                  <p>Peter became interested in the private habits of this reverend gentleman, and
                     would gladly have remained to ascertain yet more concerning them, but being
                     unable to direct the course of his dream, he was unfortunately compelled to
                     follow a melancholy creature who happened just then to cross his dreamy path.
                     True, he had somewhere read or heard that melancholy men were naturally endowed
                     with greater genius than those blessed with more volatile dispositions, and he
                     therefore expected to gain from this new subject what he had missed by losing
                     the other. He was led to a large and splendid establishment, which he regarded
                     as being certainly much better calculated to produce comfort and happiness than
                     melancholy. He had scarcely entered, before he heard a harsh, shrill voice
                     re-echoing through the house, and when the termagant, who seemed to have
                     inherited from nature a perfect right to its possession, made her appearance,
                     he could not help repeating to himself the proverb of Solomon, "<emph>It
                        is</emph> better to dwell in a corner of the house-top, than with a brawling
                     woman in a wide house." "What an excellent Tatianian he would have made,"
                     remarked a pert young lady of the village, who would sometimes honor Peter with
                     a few moments of her attention, and to whom the thought of such unfortunate
                     husbands always afforded matter for merriment. "Why so?" anxiously queried
                     Peter, who<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6407-00000078"/> could not fathom her
                     meaning. "Because they maintained that all, except themselves, were damned
                     through mother Eve, and that women were made by the devil, to the latter of
                     which tenets your henpecked vision could no doubt have sworn with the strictest
                     of the sect." "Notwithstanding such were their origin, we would treasure them,"
                     added another. "Proving," replied she, "that the gifts from that quarter are
                     preferred, and that there is no justice in your complaints when the penalty is
                     to be paid." Peter was naturally somewhat sympathetic, and would gladly have
                     condoled with this melancholy man in his affliction, but the domestic pest kept
                     too strict a watch to permit it. He apprehended the consequences likely to
                     follow, should he presume too much, and therefore wisely concluded not to cause
                     the reigning spirit of the mansion to "pass still more the equilibrium of her
                     balance." He reflected how indiscreet it is to interfere in matters of this
                     kind, and remembering the advice of the old poet, he thought it judicious not
                     to disregard it: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">

                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a spectator, Peter Easy would not have objected to remain in this splendid
                     establishment of domestic misery, with the view of obtaining some practical
                     knowledge of matrimonial life. He had not ventured out of single blessedness
                     himself, for which he never gave any other reason than that he had been
                     predestinated a bachelor. In this he was believed by many of the villagers, but
                     others continued to maintain that his single blessedness was simply owing to
                     his aversion to the trouble necessarily encountered in visiting and courting
                     for a wife. To this he would only reply, that although he could not, like the
                     old Thracians and Assyrians, rise from his bed in the morning, attend the
                     market with his purse, and return in the evening with one of the fairest and
                     most enchanting maids in the kingdom; nor cooly exchange, for a lovely and
                     bewitching partner, "one hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco, cash," the value
                     of the best article, as was the practice of, his good-natured ancestors, he yet
                     lived in an age affording equal if not greater matrimonial facilities. "Now,"
                     he would declare, "no little of the labor of visiting and courting is
                     voluntarily assumed by the ladies themselves, through ten thousand modest
                     expedients which their ingenuity has invented; and should this prove
                     insufficient, why, it is the easiest matter in the world to pick up a wife on
                     any day of the year upon any highway in the country." Concluding his bachelor
                     prejudices to be real, they quite naturally<pb n="156-157"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000079"/> rally induced him to believe that in the
                     domestic affairs of this magnificent mansion, he could see the fruits and
                     consequences of marriage in their true and proper light. Fortune, however, was
                     inclined to deal more favorably with him, and his attention was arrested by a
                     handsome young man who hurried from the building as if anxious to escape the
                     unpleasant sounds of the voice within. Peter followed him as he walked
                     leisurely and contentedly along, until he came to his residence, which was a
                     small, yet handsomely arranged and neatly furnished building. As the young man
                     opened the door, his pretty young wife was the first to meet and welcome him
                     with her cheerful countenance and happy smiles, and then they so lovingly
                     embraced each other, that Peter's heart, though long a stranger to such
                     feelings, impulsively began to respond to theirs. He turned away, perhaps to
                     check its beatings, but now affirms he did so simply to resolve this astounding
                     mystery; for it was his firm conviction, based upon his own extensive
                     observation, that marriages were formed with no other design than that of
                     providing for the parties a proper and convenient person with whom to fight and
                     quarrel whenever inclination prompted. "It was well to turn away," replied the
                     pert young lady before alluded to, "for your eyes should never be permitted to
                     feast upon so holy a scene. Like all of your bachelor kin, you 'are not worthy
                     to see a man first in the morning,' as the saying of the Benjins used to have
                     it. The unhappy Dido, who pronounced you a pack of brutes, spoke only the
                     truth; and you deserve no better fate than that decreed by the Spartan ruler,
                     who ordained that all of your species should be excluded from the sports and
                     dances of the women, and compelled to run up and down the Forum, unclad and
                     freezing, singing songs in dishonor of themselves." "Surely," replied Peter,
                     "rather than endure so rigorous a discipline or punishment, each of us would
                     follow Luther's jest, and carve unto himself an obedient wife out of a block of
                     stone; or if that would not suffice, perhaps profit by the example of Henry
                     VIII., and 'put his neck into the yoke, as the only remedy,' though the spouse
                     provided for him should prove to be nothing but 'a great Flander's mare.'" When
                     Peter again looked upon the young couple, they were comfortably seated
                     together, and both seemed still to enjoy the "tender caress" just as much as
                     they could have done in their wooing days; but this was so contrary to his
                     previous observation, and so conflicted with his theory, that he sadly
                     misinterpreted their conduct. He had forgotten the advice of a friend who had
                     repeatedly warned him against indiscriminately venturing opinions upon matters
                        concerning<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6407-00000080"/> cerning which he was
                     entirely ignorant, lest he might find frequent cause to repent of his errors;
                     for should he happen to be right once in a hundred times, he would certainly be
                     more fortunate than the rest of mankind generally are. He accordingly gives it
                     as his settled opinion, that these two visions of his dream were so addicted to
                     such demonstrations of affection that they could not avoid indulging in them,
                     nor be very particular towards whom they were exhibited. Such practices, Peter
                     declares, are so very common; and he even presumes to account through them for
                     the habits of tenderness which some married people happen to acquire. He could,
                     therefore, not well decide which were the most blessed—this apparently well
                     satisfied couple, or the pair he had seen at the splendid mansion, under the
                     lowering of a domestic storm.</p>
                  <p>When Peter emerged from the cottage, he came into a dreary street, studded with
                     rows of dilapidated houses on either side, each of which seemed to give ample
                     evidence of the wretchedness existing within. Here he encountered three
                     "ministers of mercy," who visited this locality on pretence of relieving the
                     wants and distresses of the people. Their holy mission at once arrested his
                     attention, and claimed his regard. How happy the influence of charity,
                     reflected he, coming like the sweet sympathy of angels to bless this suffering
                     fering community. It was a maxim of Plato, that the "end and aim of all human
                     actions is some good;" and in no other channel can more be accomplished than in
                     the one in which these seemingly worthy men appeared to be engaged. Who can
                     ponder upon the mission of the noble vivandiere, the providence of the French
                     soldier, as he sees her following the camp, extending to the weak and weary,
                     the disabled and fatigued, the hand of help and hospitality, without feeling
                     how small are all things compared with human sympathy and love? Her
                     self-sacrificing and sublime benignity,—attending the rough warrior in his
                     danger, relieving him when in want, aiding him when in distress, ministering to
                     him in sickness, tenderly raising him when he falls upon the field of carnage
                     and providing a place of safety, binding his wounds with her salves, her
                     balsams, and her rolls of soft linen, and freely sharing her delicacies, her
                     smiles, and her good wishes,—gives us a foretaste of that eternity of bliss
                     which shall be the just reward of the good, after a separation from the
                     blighting struggles, and contentions, and jealousies of human life. How well
                     for the world were each a vivandiere, alike in peace and in war! What suffering
                     would be driven from our midst, what misery averted, what wretchedness
                     reclaimed, what happiness dispensed around! Peter imagined he<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000081"/> here saw an imitation of her example, and it
                     acted like a charm upon his easy nature. How sad, then, was the sudden change
                     of his feelings when he discovered his mistake, and ascertained that these were
                     nothing but shrewd pretenders after all, who had succeeded, by cunning and
                     hypocrisy, to secure somewhat of a reputation for honesty and charity.
                     Affecting religiously to help the poor, they were only magnanimously helping
                     themselves, at the expense of the little generosity left in the community. How
                     often, thought he, do people obtain credit for possessing a "big heart" just
                     because they have none at all.</p>
                  <p>Peter was no longer inclined to follow these unworthy administrators of the
                     public bounty, and turning round he beheld a small, hump-backed individual, who
                     at once excited his interest. There was something peculiarly repulsive in this
                     man's countenance, which invariably prompted all who came in contact with him
                     to put their hands into their pockets and their fingers upon their purses.
                     Peter was not long in ascertaining that he was a broker and usurer, who,
                     following his profession in the midst of these poor and humble creatures,
                     seemed to fatten upon their poverty as does the vulture upon its unfortunate
                     prey. Whenever Peter relates this incident of his dream, he declaims with all
                     the vehemence he possesses. These inhuman and unfeeling wretches, he declares,
                     are the most formidable servants of the devil, and always inherit his qualities
                     to so eminent a degree that no stranger could distinguish the servants from the
                     master. As the hawk pounces upon the helpless and trembling little sparrow,
                     they fasten their greedy talons upon the tatters of a ragged dress with
                     inextricable clutch; and as the savage beast licks the gore of its victim, they
                     suck the blood of theirs until crimson to the dewlap and purple to the elbows.
                     Pandora let loose her horde of evils to trouble the world, said the heathens.
                     The Christian acknowledges that God has not so restricted the power of Satan as
                     to prevent him from sending his scourges upon the earth, of which he has
                     liberally availed himself by establishing his agents in the form of usurers and
                     brokers in every section of the world. Of old, they were justly regarded as
                     little better than murderers, and decidedly worse than thieves; for, says Cato
                     in Cicero, "our ancestors enacted in their laws, that a thief should be
                     condemned to pay double, but an usurer quadruple." The Jew has at least bigotry
                     and prejudice, inherited from his fathers for nearly two thousand years, to
                     offer as an excuse when he robs the Gentile, and yet it is a common saying,
                     "that every day he takes an oath to do what he can to cheat the Christians;"
                     but these indiscriminately<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6407-00000082"/> nately
                     plunder heathen and Christian, exhibiting no emotion beyond a satanic chuckle
                     over their success. They are ravenous pests who speculate upon poverty and
                     misfortune, and digest the misery around them with savage glee—knaves who, for
                     want of souls themselves, seek to crush the souls of the unfortunate and
                     distressed, apparently finding happiness in their agonies, and nectar in their
                     tears. Ah! thought Peter, what worthy denizens of the pit they will make, and
                     what amusement they will afford to their master in their efforts to prey upon
                     each other, for doubtlessly they will follow their unrighteous trade, as the
                     only one fit to be pursued in hell!</p>
                  <p>Easy Peter regarded this as truly an afflicted street when he was drawn from
                     the usurer to the rendezvous of the speculators. Amid the wretchedness and
                     poverty of this locality, there was an abundance of illgotten gain, as he had
                     sufficient opportunity to witness. These new visions of his dream had assembled
                     for the purpose of making a renewed effort in their swindling schemes, and were
                     engaged in revolving their plans with evident satisfaction. Brigands have their
                     leaders, pirates their captains, and these, brigands and pirates sanctioned by
                     society, had their master spirit too. The common bands of freebooters generally
                     select as their chiefs the most desperate and daring amongst them—these had
                     elevated the most heartless to equal distinction. Peter watched them framing
                     their lies, and fortifying them with plausibility, and pronounced the loathsome
                     mass a fit dish for public gullibility to digest. Here were schemes for
                     particular purposes and special individuals—there preparations for each,
                     however large or limited his means. Their enterprises had but a single basis: a
                     design to enrich themselves, at whatever cost to their fellows. This one end
                     had swallowed up every principle of integrity, every entity in morals, every
                     sympathetic impulse of the heart. The misery and distress, the tears, and
                     suffering, and despair, necessarily occasioned by their deceptions, and frauds,
                     and robberies, never disturbed their quiet, but were simply regarded as
                     pleasing comicalities to amuse them whilst pocketing the plunder. Homer assures
                     us that the profession of the robber was regarded as glorious by some of the
                     ancients, and Plutarch informs us that amongst the Spaniards his exploits
                     passed for gallant adventures. Though we punish the bold and daring rogue,
                     without making the least allowance for his hair-breadth escapes, the
                     treacherous plunderer in our midst, who does not even possess the redeeming
                     trait of physical courage, receives our countenance and esteem. As Peter was
                        witnessing<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6407-00000083"/> this excellent
                     illustration of selfishness and thievery, which a credulous people first pay
                     dearly for and then honor, their operations were interrupted for a moment by
                     the entrance of the Chief, or President of the band, in company with a
                     well-to-do looking individual, on whose arm he was affectionately leaning. They
                     had been friends for many years. and through the false yet plausible
                     representations of the former, the latter soon fell into the snare.
                     Unsuspectingly he became the victim to their designs, and though he left
                     perfectly content, another revolution of the earth was certain to find him a
                     bankrupt. It is true, reflected Peter, that villany is often disguised under
                     the garb of friendship, and where we most confide suspicion is most
                     required.</p>
                  <p>Peter now heard a great noise in the street, and hurrying to the place from
                     whence it proceeded, he witnessed a grand display of pugilistic skill. What had
                     given origin to the quarrel he was unable to ascertain, yet so bitter was the
                     rage of the antagonists, who numbered some dozen or more, that it had already
                     lasted a considerable time, nor did it seem to be in the least abating. There
                     were but two spectators to the scene, one of whom appeared to be much
                     frightened and concerned, and was using every persuasion to pacify the heated
                     combatants. The other looked calmly on, perfectly composed at what he saw,
                     until unable to contain himself any longer, he approached his friend and very
                     mildly addressed him: "Sir, I crave your pardon for having been amused at your
                     generous but mistaken efforts to quell this foolish quarrel. You must know that
                     there are those in this strange world of ours who have totally blunted every
                     feeling of refinement, and utterly destroyed whatever moral sensibility they
                     may once have possessed. Upon such your honest appeals are always in vain. That
                     they should not be entirely placed beneath mortality, however, God has kindly
                     endowed them with a physical sensibility, through which you may often
                     successfully reach their depraved minds and obdurate hearts. You have appealed
                     to the moral feelings of these rioters to no purpose; and now, to demonstrate
                     what I have said, let me ascertain what impression can be made upon their
                     physical sensibilities." Thus saying, he threw off a portion of his cumbersome
                     apparel, and giving notice that he had watched their proceedings for upwards of
                     an hour, he declared that the battle must now be ended. This proving
                     ineffectual, he entered into their midst, and making several (to use a
                     technical phrase,) "feel the unpleasant weight of his fists," he soon dispersed
                     the boisterous crowd. An odd mode, thought Peter, of making peace, yet in this
                     in stance a very effectual one.</p>
                  <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6407-00000084"/>
                  <p>Immediately after quiet had been restored, the street suddenly became very
                     populous, and Peter's attention was arrested by the occupant of a splendid
                     conveyance, who was industriously engaged in answering the polite recognitions
                     that greeted him from every side. That this was a personage of no little
                     distinction seemed so evident that Peter asked of the first passer-by what
                     place of trust or honor he filled to such general satisfaction. The inquiry
                     simply elicited the information that he was a private gentleman, who had
                     succeeded in amassing great wealth by taking usury from the poor, and selling
                     worthless stocks to all whom he could deceive into a purchase. He was but one
                     of many illustrations of what Juvenal has written, <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"That sins alike unlike rewards have found,</l>
                           <l>And whilst this villain's hang'd, the other's crowned."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q> Though every one knew him to be a rogue and a thief, the good condition in
                     which his practices had placed him, secured public obeisance. What a multitude
                     of sins, thought Peter, can be covered by a coach, and what monstrous respect
                     we extend to the knave when blessed with the smiles of fortune!</p>
                  <p>Turning from the occupant of the coach, Peter beheld a singularly ludicrous,
                     but withal a very distressing spectacle. A poor, poverty-cursed creature was
                     dying of starvation, whilst a wealthy gentleman, who had been pitying him for
                     days, was tenderly bending over him and deploring his great distress, but could
                     not so much open his heart as to reach into his well-filled purse and draw
                     forth a paltry dollar to give relief. Strange, thought Peter, that men will
                     whine, and fret, and lament, over human misery and suffering, and yet so fastly
                     clutch a shilling as not to use it freely in obtaining aid and giving
                     succour.</p>
                  <p>As Peter was gazing upon this unhappy scene, a smiling little gentleman crossed
                     his path, whom he was now compelled to follow. This interesting individual
                     appeared to be the friend of all whom he encountered, being exceedingly social
                     and affable. His friendly greetings were always returned with the same
                     politeness, though frequently with much less affection. He had acquired a great
                     reputation for benevolence, which so elicited Peter's esteem that he was
                     pleased with every mark of attention exhibited towards him. It was a maxim of
                     the Stoics that "men were, for the sake of men, brought into the world, that
                     they might assist and benefit each other," and Peter fancied he here saw one,
                     at least, who lived up to this magnanimous aphorism. This good opinion,
                     however, was suddenly changed upon reaching his residence and discovering that
                     he was the head of a mongrel banking institution, and so well<pb n="168-169"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000085"/> adapted to his business that he experienced
                     little difficulty in defrauding and plundering his customers, even whilst
                     swearing how much he designed to befriend them. He was extremely pleasant to
                     all in front of the counter, and though profusely lavish and exceedingly fair
                     in promises, these were only made to afford him amusement in devising the most
                     ingenious modes in which to break them. He had long robbed the State of its
                     just portion of the dividends, used the funds of the institution in fraudulent
                     transactions, and placed them out secretly at usury. After thus plundering
                     thousands, he very generously gave a little of the booty in charity to the
                     poor. How very easy it is, thought Peter, to win a good name, if you but know
                     how to play the hypocrite behind a fortune.</p>
                  <p>When Peter emerged from the bank, his eyes encountered a character whose odd
                     appearance at once challenged his notice. He seemed to "take the world
                     extremely easy," being quite philosophic in his indifference to passing events,
                     yet prided himself upon always rendering full justice to mankind, and their
                     good and evil practices, their virtues and their vices, their errors and their
                     follies. Peter ascertained that he had been suddenly raised, by some fortunate
                     occurrence, from abject poverty to considerable wealth. The cruel manner in
                     which he had been neglected when poor by many whose flatteries now daily
                     greeted him, had somewhat soured his disposition; and although he was generous
                     to those who had once befriended him, he felt little sympathy for the rest of
                     the species. Peter learned that he had engaged to give to a stranger, who
                     contemplated removing his residence to that place, some knowledge of the
                     people, their character and habits. Nothing could have been more gratifying to
                     Peter Easy, so he kept close to his heels until he arrived at the corner of one
                     of the principal streets, the place appointed for their meeting, where he found
                     the stranger in waiting.</p>
                  <p>There, said he to the stranger, as a poor, though apparently happy individual
                     passed by, is a personation of honesty. With such a man, the old peasants used
                     to say, "one may safely play at mora in the dark." This, however, is a very
                     questionable compliment in our day, and has brought him nothing but poverty as
                     his reward, than which few evils could be greater under our present social
                     organization. Possessed of a good nature, and feeling a proper interest in the
                     welfare of his friends, he never refused to extend his helping hand, until he
                     has been placed in the deplorable condition of being compelled to hunt for aid
                     himself. A task, thought Peter, which Pluto should have devised for human
                     punishment, instead of providing a hades.</p>
                  <p>The short gentleman, continued he, who has<pb n="170-171"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000086"/> just passed, is an honored and skilful follower
                     of a profession which has acquired considerable note in the world, though now
                     it must be practiced secretly. What has occasioned this interdict is not easily
                     discovered. Should you say to that gentleman that an improved moral public
                     opinion caused it, he would merrily take your arm, and by leading you to a
                     number of highly respectable resorts, soon show you how much, at least in
                     practice, the majority is on the other side. It is said of the old Germans,
                     that in their passion for gaming, they often staked their persons upon a die,
                     and if unsuccessful, patiently became slaves. The world has made of human life
                     nothing but an uncertain game, in which the shrewdest cheats frequently obtain
                     the greatest honor. No wonder, then, that many who would not purchase heaven by
                     a little inconvenience, never hesitate to follow in the German's wake,
                     profiting if successful, and enduring if unlucky. That gentleman's skill has
                     thus far saved him. When he first came amongst us, one of his bachelor kin was
                     reputed wealthy, whilst he was designated as the only heir. Notwithstanding his
                     professional practices, which were of course not taken into account, he married
                     a most respectable citizen's daughter, who had long been angling for an heir:
                     but the bargain has proved an unprofitable able one after all. His wealthy kin,
                     becoming intimate with his pretty housekeeper, eventually married her—thus
                     establishing a different order of succession. Ah, thought Peter, "the best laid
                     plans o' men and mice gang aft aglie," and the foolish dreams of fickle maidens
                     often end in a life of good repentance.</p>
                  <p>Yonder, sir, is another professional gentleman, but his profession is of a
                     different cast. He mistook his calling, and without possessing any brain,
                     desired to become a lawyer, but has failed even to make a tolerable
                     pettifogger. I am assured that his teacher, who swore that his skull was so
                     "miserably thick" that scarcely an idea could be battered into it, constantly
                     importuned and urged him to venture upon some learned profession, having been
                     fully persuaded, from observation, that the stupidity which he so eminently
                     possessed, was one of the most essential qualifications for such an
                     undertaking. I have advised him to turn his attention to medicine, as being
                     better suited to his calibre, and in which he might perhaps prove more
                     prosperous, or at least find greater security for his deficiencies. He still
                     clings to his profession, however, and having thus far maintained his dignity
                     by constant calls upon his acquaintances, he is now prepared to cheat them all.
                     A practice, thought Peter, quite common, but no one need expect<pb n="172-173"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000087"/> to pass through the world without contributing
                     his quota towards supporting the drones that are in it.</p>
                  <p>There, sir, you may rest assured you see a moral man. Never mind his rags, for
                     you must know that young men, morality, and fine linen, seldom go together in
                     this world, where fathers invite libertines to their houses, where mothers
                     welcome the attentions paid to their daughters by noted debauchees, and where
                     young maidens themselves prefer a smile from wealthy licentiousness to a nod
                     from virtuous poverty. Though he is neither Godwardly nor manwardly crooked,
                     which should secure him esteem in a world of such great pretence to excellence,
                     he has sufficiently experienced that virtue, when contrasted only with its
                     present social rewards, is but an "empty name, a phantom, an abject slave,
                     exposed to the insults of fortune," as the dying Roman Stoic has declared. He
                     has been tempted enough, but relying upon the self-approval which has never
                     abandoned him, this has only made him a more shining example. I proclaim to
                     you, upon better authority than my own, that there <emph>is</emph> a resting
                     place provided for the troubled, and that men like he will inherit it. Thanks,
                     thought Peter, for the happy prospect of adding another to the names in my
                     little volume. [Here it must be explained that Peter had long kept a small
                     book, in which he had written the names of all whom he personally encountered
                     during his life, and who, he supposed, might stand a respectable chance of
                     profiting by the exchange of worlds to be made at their last gasp; but thus far
                     he had occasion to call it into requisition only on three several occasions.
                     The third time, however, having discovered his own deception, he used it to
                     amend by erasing one of the names previously registered there.]</p>
                  <p>You see yonder group of three: the one is a petty printer, the other an
                     unscrupulous politician, and the third an independent voter. Altogether there
                     is wit enough amongst them to make one tolerable fool, and heart enough to make
                     one paltry villain. The first endeavors to persuade the public that the second
                     is an honest and patriotic citizen, for which he receives the common rewards of
                     the political toady: a pleasant smile and lavish promises to begin,—a bitter
                     curse, worse treachery, and a parting kick, to end; the other has already been
                     in office for a time, and has stolen sufficient for another campaign, whilst
                     the third is just preparing to increase his shouts for the good of the country,
                     for which he demands a greater indulgence to his appetites. The palate is a
                     marvellous channel through which to obtain distinction and preferment, an easy
                     manufactory of good opinion, extorting pledges of eternal friendship with
                     astonishing rapidity, and<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6407-00000088"/> clinching
                     a kind conclusion with emphatic precision. The old maxim has it, that "you may
                     easily pin down a fellow's nose to a full table," and much of the success and
                     distinction in the world has no better basis. The aspirant yonder knows full
                     well how to avail himself of this one of our good-natured imperfections, and
                     having duped the people once, through its aid and the assistance of his
                     companions, this success has emboldened him to make another effort. Beware of
                     them all, for though they may be loud in their declamations and vociferous in
                     their patriotic demonstrations, they still answer Seneca's description,—"their
                     liberty consists principally in stuffing their bellies"—and may yet incur the
                     general ridicule instead of obtaining the public plunder. The most serious
                     public matters, you know, are often made the merest farces, and the frequent
                     promotion of knaves as often incurs no paltry penalties, as you may learn from
                     that red-faced individual approaching this way. "Mankind," says an old
                     philosopher, "are not so happy, as that the best things shall have the most
                     patrons and defenders;" and notwithstanding the habits of that officer, he has
                     been elevated to the chief position of this place, and now sits in judgment
                     upon all offenders. His first morning task is to meet his friends at the
                     "Stag's Head" yonder, his second to feast upon and imbibe the wherewith with to
                     maintain his ruddy hue, and his third to reel to his office, open his judicial
                     council, and dispose of the drunken or offending creatures who may have been
                     taken into custody during the night, not so much for ill behaviour as to
                     provide a paltry fee for the police. Of course, a police whose rewards depend
                     upon the number of unfortunate creatures that may fall into their clutches,
                     cannot be remarkably cautious upon whom they exercise their authority, nor
                     measure personal freedom by any very exact or liberal scale. Nothing beyond the
                     prospect of a few picayunes, thought Peter, is required to make men's vision
                     double, and cause them to discover heinous offences where the disinterested and
                     humane only see matter for merriment or pity.</p>
                  <p>Here comes a peculiar organization of human qualities. Avarice, prodigality,
                     and falsehood, are that man's principal characteristics—a combination of
                     inconsistent vices which make him rather a petty fool than a sensible knave, to
                     which latter distinction he seems to aspire. To day he will clutch a shilling
                     with a grasp so powerful that nothing can extort it, and tomorrow he will
                     contract a debt to gratify the most paltry vice that may move him. Should he
                     happen to get into your debt upon such an occasion, he will not be at a loss
                     for lies to evade your demand. When<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6407-00000089"/>
                     Mareschal de Rochelaure was accused of taking part with the Duke of Mayenne, he
                     answered the king that he "did not follow the duke, but his own money, for his
                     debt would be but in a desperate condition, if he did not stick close to his
                     debtor." Your tenacity in sticking close to that man would only extort from him
                     the same falsehood a thousand times, and if detected and reproached, he would
                     coolly ask you whether you were so cursed a fool as to believe him! He never
                     enjoys a hearty laugh, save when he has duped some unsuspecting individual who
                     may have been induced to confide in him.——You need not be surprised at his
                     quick and sudden disappearance around the corner; for yonder comes his especial
                     friend, the collector, who has caused him to tell more lies than a dozen of
                     satan's imps could register in a year, and make more clumsy dodges than could
                     be chronicled in a volume as large as a quarto Bible. Of all dreaded things in
                     our place, that collector is the most dreaded. He is a clever, sociable, and
                     amusing fellow, who first puts you in a happy humor by his joviality, and then
                     draws the money from your purse before you are aware of it. He was quite a
                     favorite a few years ago, his society being universally courted, but since he
                     has engaged in his present employment every body dodges and runs from him. My
                     dear sir, if you wish to preserve your friendly intercourse with a
                     neighborhood, never become a collector; but should you ever be beset with more
                     friends than you know what to do with, I know of no honorable process by which
                     you can so easily get rid of them as by commencing this troublesome business.
                     However brave a people may be, reflected Peter, they have never yet had the
                     courage boldly to face a bill, and many who had laughed danger in the face,
                     skulked like cowards into the darkest corner upon beholding the simple shadow
                     of a creditor.</p>
                  <p>You observe yonder lynx-eyed individual moving slowly along. He sees all that
                     is passing within vision around him. His two eyes seem to answer the purposes
                     of a hundred, and are constantly in motion. Although everything within their
                     range falls under their quick and penetrating scrutiny, they behold nothing to
                     admire or to make him glad. They might as well gaze upon an utter blank, and
                     certainly he would experience more comfort should they recognise only a wide
                     and dismal waste instead of prosperity and happiness. He is as despicable a
                     victim of envy as the world ever saw, which simply moves him to hate the
                     success of those around him, and repine at their happiness. He can only find
                     gratification in their distress and joy in their calamities. A tinge of envy,
                     however much descried, is sometimes productive of good results,<pb n="178-179"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000090"/> for I have known it to prove an incentive to
                     exertion where all else had failed; but when permanently retained, it becomes
                     the powerful and fertile cause of hypocricies, lies, deceits, treacheries,
                     slanders, annihilating every good quality in nature, and yet unsatisfied, still
                     adding fuel to its evil ones. That man would not hesitate to blast the
                     qualities of your brain, merely because he cannot bear your superiority; nor
                     would he pause to ruin you in your possessions, although he should not derive
                     the least profit from it. Whilst, however, he discovers pleasure in the ruin
                     alike of those above and below him, he finds a vulture in his evil passion,
                     which, "like iron over-run with rust, not only defiles, but destroys himself
                     continually." It is well, reflected Peter, that passions which can only
                     experience delight in the evil fate of others, should likewise make a meal upon
                     their possessor, and that whilst he smiles upon the calamities of the
                     unfortunate, his smile should be but an expression of his inward torture.</p>
                  <p>There you may recognise a bald-pated knave, whose age, instead of preserving
                     him from the snares of the young, only seems to encourage and embolden him the
                     more. He is in company with his son-in-law, to whom he once refused to give his
                     daughter's hand in marriage, for reasons which he did not care to make known
                     either to her or his household. The vigilance and curiosity of those less
                     interested, however, soon succeeded in ascertaining them, and the discovery
                     afforded no little amusement at his perplexity. The chief priests and scribes
                     were not in a greater quandary when they had the choice to say "yea," and be
                     convicted of their baseness, or "nay," and be stoned by the people. He had too
                     often met the aspirant to his daughter's hand at places of resort where none of
                     our community who values his moral character is likely to go. Peter was
                     somewhat at a loss here, yet he could not help reflecting that the father who
                     visits places of crime, is in a very ridiculous dilemma when compelled to make
                     use of his personal knowledge and his own dishonor to preserve the reputation
                     of his family.</p>
                  <p>See there—worthy patterns of a gentleman and lady. He is an honest and faithful
                     husband, and she an affectionate and virtuous wife. They love wisely and well,
                     live happily in each other, and are models to all who know them. Make them your
                     friends, for the very atmosphere in which they move is worth more than all the
                     attention a thousand such as have yet passed us could bestow. The lord who
                     loves his lady truly, and ever keeps unbroken the faith he has plighted to her,
                     becomes as much an example to the world as a joy to his wife; and the lady who
                     never forgets her affection and allegiance to her lord, is so much superior to
                     the common woman<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6407-00000091"/> that to him she
                     always seems an angel out of Paradise. "An honest man," said old Simonides,
                     "can have nothing in this world better than a good wife," and surely an honest
                     woman can ask no higher blessing than a good husband. You see such in those
                     two, and may well seek their friendship and profit by their excellencies of
                     character and correctness of habits. Ah! thought Peter, a happy oasis in the
                     desert of matrimonial life, still inspiring reverence for the institution,
                     though it be made the fickle plaything of the world, its common game of
                     heedless chance and hazard.</p>
                  <p>There, sir, in that old man you see an impersonation of prejudice, a quality
                     not inaptly defined as "the spider of the mind, filling it with cobwebs." His
                     opinion once set, no power on earth can change it, and beware that you press
                     not too closely, lest he adopt the convincing logic of Frederick the Great,
                     who, it is said, when argument failed to enforce his convictions, had recourse
                     to "kicking the shins of his opponent." Guide his thoughts into one channel and
                     they will follow it, though it should lead him to the devil. His prejudices
                     frequently render him as obstinate as a mule, and as often not as wise. He
                     still stands where his fathers stood before him, and joined to the idols and
                     follies of a past age, he has no sympathies with the present. If he thinks at
                     all, he does so simply to fasten upon his mind the more his cherished errors,
                     and your only policy is to "let him alone." Never, reflected Peter, undertake
                     to straighten the crooked nature of the prejudiced man, for to him all your
                     facts are nothing but a stumbling-block, and all your reasons simple
                     foolishness.</p>
                  <p>Yonder lame individual furnishes a story well illustrating the fickleness of
                     the human heart. Though we may appear to be enraptured with a single feeling,
                     the intervention of a trifling circumstance not unfrequently entirely relieves
                     us of it. That gentleman courted a fair young maiden, and eventually his
                     attentions resulted in a betrothal. An unfortunate accident soon after deprived
                     him of a leg, and being thus deformed, his love required little time to
                     extinguish her affection, and accordingly broke her faith. She had bargained
                     more for a solid man than a sound head or heart, and being disabled from
                     complying with the conditions, he was politely rejected. Thus good luck often
                     springs from misfortune, and he gained greatly by the loss of a limb. What a
                     world of cripples, thought Peter, this would suddenly become, could all who
                     desired it be relieved by the loss of a leg of the ills from which his
                     fortunate misfortune preserved him.</p>
                  <p>Turn your eyes to the left, and you may behold a fanciful pair approaching
                     towards us. That pursy and<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6407-00000092"/>
                     apparently very jovial fellow—mine host of yonder inn—keeps a resort for
                     gentility, and under the cover of respectability, sends forth unnumbered evils
                     to infest and afflict the community. The practices of his house flourish
                     admirably under the beauty of a fashionable exterior; yet the pestiferous
                     rottenness within could not withstand the eye of modern justice for a moment if
                     disguised only in rags. Public morality in the case where gold is concerned, is
                     quite a different thing from that wherein simple copper is brought into the
                     scale. Respectable crime easily escapes the keen vigilance of those who guard
                     the public virtue, whilst we are loud in their praises when some poor,
                     abandoned, God-forsaken wretch is hurried to his doom amid the imposing show of
                     a high morality and an even-handed justice. That man may lavishly spread his
                     fearful evils—the only things with which men appear to be truly bountiful—with
                     unchecked freedom; and whenever they press too heavily upon us, a few plaintive
                     groans will soon arouse the slumbering sentinels of the law. Powerful justice
                     will sound its signal, triumphantly make a brutal "descent" upon some paltry
                     hut, and drag its starving inmates to the slaughter. Well, has not Carneades
                     pronounced his definitive sentence that "justice is folly;" and what matters it
                     whether I offend, and some more unfortunate creature pays the penalty, so that
                     justice is appeased? It must have victims, and fate, ill-fortune, and poverty,
                     have not been miserly in providing them. Thus it is never at a loss for the
                     means wherewith to preserve that reputation which Tully thought so essential
                     "that even those who lived by outrage and villany could not subsist without at
                     least its shadow or semblance." That fortunate knave may prosper in his
                     practices, and though their fatal consequences may sometimes arouse our
                     vengeance, there never will be wanting those whose immolation will allay it.
                     His tall, robust companion is a character—a perfect original. He will hug, and
                     pet, and caress you with the tenderness of a captivated maiden, all for a
                     picayune; and when he has thus fondled it out of your possession, having no
                     prospect of realizing more, he would as lovingly kick you out of doors for a
                     ha'penny—thus making you as profitable a customer as the circumstances could
                     possibly admit. Headlong and heedless withal, his actions ever in advance of
                     his thoughts, he is a mass of locomotive matter, tumbling about on the earth,
                     with no idea to accomplish, no purpose to fulfil. This is not the only one,
                     reflected Peter, who has, by some comical dispensation of nature, been placed
                     outside of his orbit, as if it designed to exhibit what a fickle whirligig can
                     be made of man by unhinging his directing power.</p>
                  <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6407-00000093"/>
                  <p>Look to that building yonder. The gentleman who has just entered it is a modern
                     reformer. He railed against the evil habits of men, and the sinful and
                     dishonest practices of the world, until sent to the penitentiary for having
                     attached another man's name to a small piece of bankable paper. The imitation
                     was good, but unfortunately for him history had chronicled the adventures of
                     Saavadra, the famous and somewhat romantic nuncio of Portugal, and having
                     failed, in his mania for improvement, to improve upon this noted forger, he
                     atoned for his unsuccessful attempt by faithfully serving the full period of
                     his sentence. He is now riding his hobby-horse of "Reform" again, with even
                     greater boldness than before. This may be owing to the extra courage acquired,
                     or perhaps to the change effected in the times, during the period which he
                     devoted to solitary meditations. The sledge-hammer mode of reform has since
                     accomplished marvels and become highly fashionable; but it is now greatly
                     feared that many too charitable fellows, in their exceedingly magnanimous
                     efforts to drive the erring back from the brink of perdition, will stand a very
                     excellent chance of tumbling in themselves. He has abandoned the task of
                     persuading for the more exalted one of coercing, which may prove more
                     profitable; but should he branch out a second time upon his own responsibility,
                     it is hoped he may realize his ideas of improvement by choosing some species of
                     roguery wherein he shall leave no historical example unexcelled. It is no
                     uncommon occurrence of the ludicrous in life, reflected Peter, to see those in
                     whom the ordinary thief could not confide, suddenly become reformers, and find
                     patrons for their presumption and fools to regard them as patterns of moral
                     propriety.</p>
                  <p>Note that gentleman and lady opposite. He is her husband. Having seen his wife
                     in dishabille the morning after his wedding, and meeting her upon his return
                     home at noon arrayed for public inspection, it is currently reported, he found
                     her so much improved and beautified that he mistook her for a stranger, and
                     absolutely asked her of the whereabout of his spouse. Nature has been
                     exceedingly kind after all. If it has ordained that youth should fade, it has
                     generously furnished the material whereby a century can be made to assume the
                     appearance of a score. What matters it that old Father Cyprian thought all
                     change the work of satan, and pronounced it running counter to the will of God
                     to paint or black the hair, because he had read, "Thou canst not make one hair
                     white or black?" Who cares for the declaration of Tertullian, that "it is the
                     devil that mounts the actors on their buskins, in order to make Jesus Christ a
                     liar, who has said, that no<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6407-00000094"/> one can
                     add one cubit to his stature?" They were both wofully mistaken, and our ladies
                     have most triumphantly refuted their errors, by silently exhibiting that a
                     hundred Tophets could not supply imps enough to make half the changes and
                     additions which they daily parade before our eyes. It is marvellous, reflected
                     Peter, what artificial charms can be conjured up by those who properly
                     understand the art of beauty; and why should they fret and complain against
                     fate, when, with paint, powder, and cotton, they are constantly proving that
                     their troublesome deficiencies were simply meant as so many kindnesses, by
                     leaving them at liberty to manufacture whatever hue and dimensions that might
                     best please their fancies?</p>
                  <p>The young lady and gentleman who have just passed by, seem to have arrested
                     your attention. They are intimate acquaintances, and it is conjectured they
                     will be something more in due time. You heard her indignant remark upon the
                     dissoluteness of that young man yonder, a distant and ill-starred connexion of
                     hers, and her emphatic wish for an edict providing for the decapitation of all
                     such reckless creatures. Her creed, my dear sir, if impartially carried into
                     effect, would scarcely permit a head to remain solidly upon the shoulders of a
                     single citizen in the country; and her companion, though he does share her
                     virtuous affections, would be one of the first to despair for his own. If
                     shrewder and more cunning, he certainly is no better than the individual who
                     has elicited her censure, though she knows it not. Her ignorance is blissful,
                     however deceptive. Should some superhuman agency, thought Peter, suddenly
                     reveal the truthful characters of Cupid's followers, how many confiding maidens
                     would be startled at having admired the most knavish deceivers, and how many
                     foolish swains would stand aghast with horror at the dishonest treachery of
                     their lady-loves!</p>
                  <p>In that young man approaching this way, you may recognise somewhat of a
                     philosopher. You might as well attempt to scale the mountains of the moon as to
                     persuade him that there was much real virtue in the world. "We are honest," he
                     argues, "from convenience or policy, and apparently moral from a fear of
                     society, which has established certain rules, and is given to certain general
                     opinions, the violations of which are always attended with some difficulties or
                     vexations. The old Romans had their censors, whose chief business it was to
                     inspect the morals of the citizens, and could we, by following some such
                     example, spread out before us the hidden conduct and practices of each
                     individual, the little of real conscience and truth, substantial honesty and
                     morality, we should be able to detect, might tempt us to abandon our moral code
                        entirely<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6407-00000095"/> tirely. Or could we, by
                     a glance, penetrate the past lives and habits, and scrutinize the secret sins
                     of all whom we encounter, what a terrible blushing there would be in the world,
                     and how many would laugh in each other's faces! Many whose apparent honesty now
                     claims your respect, unable any longer to disguise their hypocrisy, would only
                     make merry over the numerous counterparts of themselves with whom they should
                     constantly come in contact. The virtuous Thrasea spoke but the truth in his
                     favorite maxim, that 'he who suffers himself to hate vice will hate mankind;'
                     for, although all must pretend to virtue from a kind of social necessity, it is
                     a garment which they cast aside without a pause when rendered safe from
                     detection, ever faithfully illustrating the saying of Agathias, that 'virtue
                     upon necessity is just as long lived as the fear that occasions it.' The world
                     seems desperately determined to vindicate what its Saviour has affirmed, and no
                     prophecy promises to be more fully realized than his sorrowful declaration that
                     'narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.'"
                     Such is a taste of the young man's opinions, in which he is so firmly rooted,
                     that should you persuade him that the fate of the town depended upon ten
                     righteous men to be found within it, he would at once take to his heels, and
                     never pause until he was far out of danger. Whether ther there is not too much
                     of correctness in his melancholy views, you must determine for yourself.—No
                     very difficult matter, reflected Peter, amid the many unpleasant examples that
                     are destined daily to bring unwelcome aid to your judgment, and exhibit to your
                     gaze so many who seem but to struggle the hardest to obtain the greatest
                     curses.</p>
                  <p>You will pardon the interruption, said the stranger, but my attention has been
                     arrested by the counterfeit manikin suspended by the neck to the branch of
                     yonder tree, and my curiosity excited to know what fickle whim or fancy placed
                     it there. Its import, replied the other, not endeavoring to restrain his
                     merriment, is very significant. The female occupants of the adjoining houses
                     have for some time been engaged in a bitter quarrel. The intolerable scolding
                     propensities of one of them, common report avers, caused her husband to resort
                     to that effective mode of obtaining relief. The cunning of the other, in the
                     progress of the quarrel, has devised that silent but expressive expedient as an
                     annoyance and remembrancer to her enemy, and by replacing it as often as it is
                     destroyed, promises fair to be the conqueror in the end.</p>
                  <p>Here you may recognise one of those silly or knavish creatures, in whom it is
                     difficult to tell whether the mule or the monkey predominates. He knows but
                        of<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6407-00000096"/> one vice in the world, and it
                     is the subject of his constant denunciations. He is ceaseless in his praises of
                     honesty, and as "opportunity makes the thief," according to the proverb, he
                     will probably preserve his reputation as long as he remains amongst those who
                     know him. It is given as a rule, and in case you encounter him it may prove of
                     service, always to mistrust the man who too much prides himself upon possessing
                     a certain quality, and to be suspicious of him who constantly deals in vehement
                     complaints against a particular vice. Such are generally weak in what they
                     boast themselves strong, and their darts are frequently directed against the
                     very fault peculiar to themselves. It is so, thought Peter, even with the great
                     world, which ever descries its own practices, and yet tenaciously continues in
                     them, as if loathe to part with such excellent causes to elicit its censure,
                     and such admirable escape-valves through which its wrath may freely ooze itself
                     away.</p>
                  <p>There is an amusing and withal pitiable victim of a mistake. He was a lodger at
                     a public inn, and rising early one morning, he was mistaken for a burglar, and
                     received a terrible beating from his hasty and suspicious host. To redress this
                     injury, he flew to the law—a very singular power to decide upon a mistake. The
                     landlord, not thus to be outdone, brought a more serious charge against him in
                     retaliation. The blind Goddess, whose determinations were ascertained by two
                     intelligent juries, very magnanimously gave each the benefit of the mistake,
                     and both found comfortable lodgings in the county prison. There, thought Peter,
                     they had leisure at least to cool their sanguine tempers, and reflect upon the
                     frequent tendency of the merest trifles to grow into importance.</p>
                  <p>Opposite, you may see a genuine specimen of what the world calls a "successful
                     fellow." He claims to be a proper person to reside upon this especial sphere of
                     God's creation, and bases his peculiar fitness upon two facts: he is not
                     encumbered with an extra amount of conscience, nor is he restrained by any
                     settled principles of virtue—two things, he avers, not well calculated to
                     promote prosperity in a world where the right and wrong of human actions are so
                     generally estimated by profit and loss. He will never suffer on account of
                     possessing too much of either, both of which be regards as certain roads to
                     poverty, and consequently loss of the world's esteem. To persuade you that he
                     is doing you a service whilst plundering you, he thinks the perfection of skill
                     and ingenuity. Should he ever tempt you to enter into any of his promising
                     schemes, beware of his plausible representations, for you may swear they only
                     conceal a design to pick your pocket with your<pb n="192-193"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000097"/> own consent. No very uncommon occurrence,
                     reflected Peter, in a world where prosperity is made to depend upon a cunning
                     address, and where a shrewd head is so much preferred to an honest heart.</p>
                  <p>Approaching us, you may see a specimen of that sad human depravity so
                     frequently encountered, and whom the good morals of the virtuous public have
                     generally indulged under the plea of necessity. She was unfortunate recently in
                     disturbing the peace of a very respectable locality, and having thus
                     over-stepped the bounds of that necessity which tolerated her, she fell into
                     the meshes of the law, and gave us rather a funny illustration of the
                     melancholy effect misfortune has upon friends. Her most punctual visitors, whom
                     she had always received so very graciously, perhaps having a view to their
                     circumstances and positions in society, now repulsed her the most roughly, and
                     gave free vent to their virtuous indignation when she presumed to solicit
                        <emph>their</emph> aid. After experiencing this ingratitude and baseness,
                     she became seriously ill from the excitement; and despairing of being again
                     restored, her repentant fears set her raving as if mad. Her disconnected
                     revelations were watched with wonderful anxiety, affording great amusement to
                     some, and as greatly exciting the fears of others; but when she expressed it as
                     a Christian duty that a <emph>very</emph> minute account count of her ill-spent
                     life should be given, she caused more genuine consternation than could have
                     followed a siege of the town. The fearful disclosures of a few dozen of her
                     kind, reflected Peter, in each city and town of the country, specifically
                     setting forth the names of their visitors and lovers, could create more
                     confusion than attended the marches of Alexander, and cause a panic perhaps
                     only equalled by that of ancient Rome when invaded by the barbarians.</p>
                  <p>Turn, however, from this unwelcome picture, and behold that fancy young man
                     yonder. He is too ignorant to be of any service in the position of life to
                     which he pretends, and too much inflated with his own conceit to render himself
                     useful in a different calling. Between these not uncommon qualities, he manages
                     to trudge along, cheating his tailor, defrauding his landlord, and swindling
                     all who may be so unfortunate as to mistake his appearance for respectability
                     and his pretensions for honesty. How such palpable fools manage to maintain
                     their stupidity upon the plunder of more sensible knaves, is one of those
                     inexplicable mysteries of life which few have attempted to determine. We have
                     repudiated the rule of Aristotle, that only those employments are to be reputed
                     mean which render either the body or the soul unfit for the practice of virtue;
                     and by making certain pursuits a<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6407-00000098"/>
                     test of social standing, and the neglect of all, a sure index of
                     respectability, we have admirably succeeded in rearing a brood of vagabonds
                     whom it would now be ungenerous to neglect. Thus, perhaps, they owe more to our
                     indulgence and kindness than we are willing to acknowledge, being content to
                     endure an occasional swindle, and in this silent manner atone somewhat for an
                     evil which we have ourselves created. It is so much easier, reflected Peter, to
                     tolerate some errors than to reform them, and we are happily prepared to submit
                     to their inconveniences if they will only do us the kindness a little to tickle
                     our vanity.</p>
                  <p>Look to the windows of yonder houses—two handsome females. You may learn a
                     salutary lesson by carefully contemplating their countenances. The one has led
                     a life of guilt—the other one of innocence and virtue. Look at their smiles:
                     what sadness there is in the one, and what satisfaction there seems to linger
                     around the other! With the guilty, a smile springs only from the lips; with the
                     good, it pleasantly indicates and answers emotions of the heart. See how vexed
                     and restless the manner of the one, and how easy and calm that of the other—a
                     noble contrast between abandonment and graceful dignity. The very bearing of
                     the one indicates a knowledge of her degradation, whilst that of the other
                     firmly yet modestly asserts her equality and her claim to respect. In their
                     loneliness there, you may clearly read the thoughts of each mirrored In her
                     face. What an expression of languor, regret, melancholy, remorse, agony,
                     despair, you see in the one; what quiet repose, comfort, content, pleasure,
                     happiness, joy, is depicted in the other! See in contrast, a spectre of deep,
                     guilty sorrow, peering out from the wrinkles and furrows which tell of fearful
                     tempests and revulsions within, and a calm placid vision beaming forth the life
                     and buoyancy that speak only of the sweet serenity of the soul: dark, dreary,
                     desolate night, filled with treacheries, conspiracies, murders, sprites, and
                     hobgoblins, and bright, mellow sunshine, awakening every impulse and arousing
                     every feeling to chaste delights! The terrors of guilt must indeed be
                     fathomless, if it mixes a remorseful recollection with every smile, and
                     tortures with mental anguish even the moments treasured for repose. Excitement
                     cannot silence or drive thought from the brain, and retirement cannot prevent
                     the soul from shrinking from its own pollution. "All nature is too weak a fence
                     for sin," observes an ancient poet, and "hell itself can find no fiercer
                     torment than a guilty mind," remarks another. Whatever, reflected Peter, may be
                     the evil practices of the world, it cannot avoid the furies which they invoke,
                     nor escape the terrors of their revenge.</p>

                  <p>Ah! see my worthy friend approaching. He is a preacher, and I believe a good
                     man, who loves his fellows, and means all mankind well. His head and heart,
                     however, do not work well together—the one is as empty as the other is full.
                     Well, if the devout Japanese can perform his devotions by machinery, having his
                        <foreign xml:lang="JPN">chu-kor</foreign> constantly fixed in some running
                     stream, where it never ceases praying for the prosperity of his house, why may
                     not we go through ours with equal convenience? We are told that our ceremonies
                     seldom trouble our hearts, and if so, surely there is little reason why they
                     should trouble our tongues or limbs. Some such reflection, no doubt, has
                     induced our people to invent many fashionable and easy modes of getting into
                     heaven, for which they deserve lasting gratitude; but then the ways of the Lord
                     are inscrutable, and he has raised up a brood of stupid, prosey, old-women
                     preachers to pest and afflict them. They may make the sanctuary airy, or shut
                     out the chill, together with their servants, and then snooze away on soft, easy
                     cushions, just as though it was the most paltry trifle to inherit the kingdom;
                     yet the Lord is generous, and will frequently remind them of their error by
                     inflicting upon them the sermons of such stupid though good meaning servants as
                     my friend here. When, therefore, reflected Peter, we rightly understand the
                     uses of "bad preachers," a very common and very equivocal complaint, they
                     reveal a design the wisdom of which it is sinful to censure.</p>
                  <p>The dumpy individual yonder, wearing the badge of authority, is a worthy
                     constable. Like the great number of his class, he is an excellent man for his
                     calling, wanting both heart and brain, and being consequently little troubled
                     with conscience or integrity. Every poor wretch, whom misfortune has dragged
                     beneath our compassion, adds a trifle to his purse, and immeasurably to his
                     glory. Living on the world's depravity, he seeks to deprave it the more, that
                     he may increase the profits of his trade. Under the plea of justice he is
                     constantly outraging its holy decrees, and instead of protecting society, he
                     has become one of the worst of its pests. He will boast for hours of his
                     shrewdness, and gloat with wonderful exultation over the ruin of a victim to
                     his formidable oath. Justice would be fearfully crippled without his excellent
                     eyes, whose vision neither doors nor masonry can shut out, and rendered almost
                     entirely powerless without his ears, which happily possess the sharpness to
                     detect the minutest particulars of a crime carried wonderful distances through
                     the whispers of the wind. Though a score should surround him and witness an
                     event, he would hear more than their forty ears, and surprise them all at
                        the<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6407-00000100"/> absolute worthlessness of
                     their eyes, when he came to narrate his tale in that convenient arena for the
                     exhibition of his talents, a criminal court. Like the pander in Terence, "to
                     have the knack of perjury" he considers a necessary accomplishment, and he
                     never fails to bring down his game when once fairly brought within the range of
                     his oath. Ah, reflected Peter, how many a poor wretch's fate has depended upon
                     so excellent a swearer, and no one pitied him!</p>
                  <p>In that slender young man you behold a miserable victim to his own base
                     passions. He moves along, a loathing disgrace to himself, encountering the
                     contempt of all who have not fallen equally low in general esteem. You will
                     preserve your reputation by following their example, and carefully avoiding
                     him. His evil habits have rendered him so exceedingly infamous that nothing
                     less than the sudden acquisition of about fifty thousand dollars could make him
                     a respectable man in the estimation of our community. Should fortune thus favor
                     him, you may consider the interdict removed, and gain credit by doing obeisance
                     alike to him and his sins. What an excellent badge of character, thought Peter,
                     that can work such marvellous changes in public opinion, and hide more faults
                     and render invisible more defects than the mystic ring of Gyges.</p>
                  <p>There is a poor fellow whose head has been turned by not properly inquiring
                     into the good subject which engrossed his attention. Running wild in his good
                     excitement, he at last fancied he was blessed with extraordinary power, and for
                     a time labored with exceeding great industry in casting out devils! He has now,
                     however, abandoned the excellent work, declaring that he found so many
                     possessed that his efforts were rendered entirely useless, and vowing that the
                     harvest is still as great as it was ages ago, and the laborers equally few. No
                     doubt, thought Peter, he who shall undertake so laborious a task, will have
                     little time for idleness, for to set all things right for eternity, would
                     require nothing short of eternity itself.</p>
                  <p>When nature made that man yonder, it no doubt went outside of itself in search
                     of additional material. He is a compound too singular to have been made up
                     entirely of its own qualities. He practices medicine without being able to
                     read; plays the preacher and sometimes the prophet, and occasionally acts the
                     pettifogger. By the one he pretends to save lives, souls by the other, and
                     property by the third. He prays vociferously and predicts astounding
                     developments, but never pays his debts; he is vehement in his denunciations of
                     falsehood, but takes to lying quite naturally when it promises a fair
                     remuneration; he deplores the errors of the world, and professes infallibly to
                        drive<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6407-00000101"/> away the charms of witches;
                     he denounces credulity, and sees "spooks;" he is a philosopher, and pow-wows
                     until exhausted in breath over all diseases too powerful for his remedies.
                     Never entertaining more than one idea at a time, he must be ruled by it, no
                     matter what it be or to what foolishness it may lead him. To-night he may dream
                     of some impossible event or marvellous discovery, and to-morrow he will
                     proclaim it as a settled fact or superhuman revelation. He is constantly
                     propounding schemes to revolutionize the opinions and change the manners and
                     practices of the world, and yet swears by his faith in predestination. A mass
                     of incongruities, an embodiment of nonsense, he nevertheless finds dupes who,
                     perhaps tired of existence, will swallow his prescriptions, meet their doom
                     through his prophecies, and go to ruin through his counsel. Well, reflected
                     Peter, many a man has prospered just because he was ignorant and stupid, and
                     where wisdom starves foolishness must often grow fat.</p>
                  <p>Here you may behold a poor victim of misfortune, and a melancholy illustration
                     of how much human nature is capable of enduring. From his boyhood he has been
                     forced to encounter the terrors of adversity, and submit to the agonies of
                     poverty and want. The thumps and cuffs, he declares, originally intended for
                     equal distribution amongst several scores, through some sad mistake, have daily
                     been heaped upon his single head, nor could he dodge the most trifling bump.
                     Unable to counteract his evil fate, he eventually sought refuge against it by
                     adopting the life of the soldier. Thus flying into the face of his destiny,
                     with the odds all against him, he only aggravated it the more, adding to his
                     miseries and increasing his privations. He has figured upon many a field of
                     carnage, but fortune has ever refused to send some stray ball to end his
                     career. Abbas, the Persian king, to prevent the indignities of his misfortunes
                     from falling upon his wives, commanded their heads to be cut off in case he
                     lost the battle—certainly an infallible preventative. Not being disposed to
                     apply so rigorous a remedy to obtain relief, that unhappy creature has
                     continued to submit to the fatalities he could not avoid, and perhaps there are
                     few evils in nature which he has not felt. Though he has won the reputation of
                     a brave soldier, it is the only thing he has ever gained from his countrymen,
                     save their ingratitude. He has been to the wars, and returned to beg his bread.
                     He has stood a faithful, sentinel over his country's honor in times of danger,
                     and in its peace and prosperity he has hungered and thirsted, and no one pitied
                     him. He has grappled with the foe, and been victorious: he has fought against
                     his fate, and it conquered him; yet he is the same old patriot still. It is<pb
                        n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6407-00000102"/> said that the enjoyments of life
                     always counterbalance its ills, but he can present a tear for every pleasurable
                     emotion he has ever experienced, and a pang for every impulse of joy that has
                     ever lighted up his soul. There is, reflected Peter, a hardness of heart in the
                     world which sometimes seems directed against a single individual, making his
                     existence a fearful burthen and rendering even his hopes a terror to
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>See there—an excellent humbug. He pretends to science, and under the pretext of
                     enlightening our people, he has visited our town. To instruct the public is
                     certainly an honorable employment, but he is a miserable preceptor. In the
                     science to which he pretends he is a marvellous fool, but as an imposter he is
                     a cunning knave. Knowing his ignorance, he wisely seeks to take advantage of
                     the public curiosity, and by working it into a state of itching excitement, he
                     effects more for himself than the most consummate skill or knowledge could
                     attain. His stupid lectures are nightly greeted by gaping crowds, for which he
                     is solely indebted to the fact, that he has provoked the general
                     inquisitiveness through the common and always effectual expedient—giving
                     private lectures to the ladies! Arouse the morbid tastes of a community, and
                     the silliest mountebank will receive its encouragement. What a happy and
                     convenient thing is science, reflected Peter, not only furnishing a sufficient
                     excuse for all kinds of familiar discourse, but also taking off our hands much
                     unpleasant labor by giving currency to such magnanimous instructors.</p>
                  <p>Here you may recognise an uncongenial creature who could not survive a single
                     day without some object upon which to exercise his malice. Though he may never
                     before have seen you, you may rest assured he will report you a Villain, or
                     something not far removed from one. Of course, it is his especial business to
                     know all concerning you and your possessions, and his imagination will readily
                     account for everything: in such a manner, too, as to leave you little cause for
                     self-esteem. His only true delight appears to be in slander, and he would
                     barter heaven for a bit of scandal; yet it were folly to endeavor to avoid him,
                     for he is not without numerous counterparts whom you could scarcely hope to
                     escape, though you should immediately quit the town. Should we now, reflected
                     Peter, revive the ancient punishment of the Poles, who publicly forced the
                     slanderer beneath a table and there compelled him to bark three several times,
                     declaring that he "had lied like a dog," what a fearful and terrific yelling
                     and howling would suddenly be set up in the world!</p>
                  <p>See yonder—a "clever fellow." He has managed to store his head with an
                     abundance of old jokes and anecdotes<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6407-00000103"/>
                     ecdotes, which, having formed an effectual barrier against anything else
                     entering into it, are ever at his service. His tongue never flags, which may
                     perhaps be owing to the light burthens it is required to bear, for he never
                     troubles it to give expression to a heavy thought or weighty idea. It is said
                     that Tithonus was transformed into a grasshopper on account of his inclination
                     to talk, but the same propensity has only succeeded in converting that man into
                     a liar. He can sing a song, whistle a jig, and although he may have talent to
                     play a tolerable tune, it must be confessed he plays a game at cards with much
                     greater skill. Polite and affable, he has the address to pass for a gentleman,
                     which, together with a readiness to do their little errands and oblige their
                     whims, brought him into great favor with the ladies, as you observe he is
                     kindly recognised by every one who passes by him. He has a happy faculty of
                     adapting himself to the company into which he may be introduced; and by long
                     practice he has become so expert, that he now finds no more difficulty in
                     entertaining a circle of staid, sober, and inquisitive dotards with "old wives'
                     fables," than in directing some licentious carousal. Amongst the gifts with
                     which nature has blessed him, none has proved of more service to him than his
                     excellent stomach, which seems to be perfect proof against the law of "wear and
                     tear." He can keep you company at the table until you become stupid, drink your
                     health until you become drunk, and then coolly furnish you with a lying excuse
                     to avert the threatening frowns or pacify the angry rage of your wife. His
                     opinions and his conscience are alike pliable, which enables him without
                     trouble to suit himself either to your mind or heart, or to both if required.
                     He will defend the prejudices and errors of the one with true friendly zeal,
                     and commend the good of the other with the enthusiasm of a saint, or encourage
                     its wickedness with the skill of a panderer. Whatever pleases you will be
                     certain to delight him, and he will soon be so assimilated to your tastes as to
                     declare you his "second self." A rioting, roistering life, however, best
                     comports with his fancy, and he is constantly leading some of his numerous
                     friends into indecorous exploits or lawless adventures. He swears the world was
                     "made for sport," and why should he be as morose an anchorite, or shut himself
                     up like some sleepy monk, too drowsy to brush a fly from his nose? Then, too,
                     he is so very liberal—not only generously sharing his pleasures with you, but
                     even providing you with excellent reasons why you should partake of them, and
                     reducing your most heinous offences into "common, every-day peccadilloes." Are
                     you young, he will persuade you that few faults or vices are so monstrous as<pb
                        n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6407-00000104"/> to be denied a place amongst
                     youthful follies; and if old, what could be wiser than to employ the little
                     time remaining for you in the pursuit of pleasure and enjoyment? Freely
                     mingling with all, and never finding fault with any, his accomplishments or
                     traits of character have won for him the fine distinction of being a "very
                     clever fellow,"—which to you may mean that he is an excellent and worthy man,
                     inclined to society and familiar colloquies; whilst to another it would simply
                     indicate that he is a silly and amusing clown, or a shrewd and cunning villain.
                     Well, though such distinction may be highly honorable, it has been courted by
                     so many, and is now so promiscuously conferred, that I make it a rule always to
                     look with caution upon him who wears it, and only trust him in proportion to
                     his cleverness.</p>
                  <p>Easy Peter heard nothing more, for his attention was here arrested by a large,
                     overgrown youth, who was leaning against a ponderous tree which had very
                     magnanimously been spared from the axe, in the progress of improvement, for the
                     benefit of weary and sweltering pedestrians. This venerable relic of a past
                     age, still standing erect with its extended branches, as if defying the inroads
                     of time, had long been a great favorite with all the lazy loungers of the
                     place, and its huge trunk, to the height of some five or six feet, presented a
                     surface whose glistening and greasy smoothness could not have been imitated by
                     any tradesman's skill. Many were the changes it had witnessed, both in the old
                     time and in the new, and there was not a loiterer within miles around whose
                     faults and foibles had not been exhibited beneath its sheltering branches. Here
                     the idle personages of the town would congregate in knots and coteries,
                     detailing for the thousandth time their dry anecdotes, stale jokes, and
                     wonderful traditions, in many of which the aged tree itself bore so conspicuous
                     a part that nothing but its constant and inflexible immobility could have
                     satisfied you that it was not a moving, active, and sensible creature. This
                     happy retreat had become so very attractive indeed, that many an unpleasant and
                     unquiet home was abandoned for its more peaceful shades; and numerous were the
                     imprecations uttered against it by the ill-tempered dames of the neighborhood,
                     who, rather than acknowledge a less creditable cause in their own tongues,
                     accused the unconscious tree of enticing away their husbands to the great
                     annoyance and neglect of themselves. If evil wishes could have blasted it, it
                     would not have survived a single hour; and there was never a thunder cloud seen
                     in the distance which was not hailed with many a prayer that the storm might
                     terminate by casting its fragments and splinters to the winds. Though these
                        viragoes<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6407-00000105"/> goes could quickly raise
                     terrific tempests around their husbands' ears which never failed to take
                     effect, the thunderbolts of nature had very wisely been placed beyond their
                     reach; and thus they may renew their vengeful imprecations and malignant
                     wishes, but the venerable tree continues to rear its towering form, and their
                     disobedient husbands still take their ease beneath its shady limbs.</p>
                  <p>It was one of these idle individuals whom Peter now beheld, and his appearance
                     sufficiently indicated that he had inherited a full portion of the rewards
                     usually attending the habits to which he was addicted. His old, weather-beaten
                     hat admirably betokened that it had done good service in its time. Although the
                     many misfortunes it had encountered, and the narrow escapes it had made, left
                     some very visible impressions, they had failed to deprive it of its entire brim
                     and crown, and the shreds that remained still adhered to each other with a
                     tenacity that spoke eloquently of their former harmonious love. His
                     ill-conditioned apparel, like a divided household, evinced a strong disposition
                     to mutiny and separate, and though much had been done to keep it together,
                     evidently by his own unskilful hands, it still obstinately resisted his kind
                     endeavors. Rent pieces of what had once borne a resemblance to cloth dangled
                     loosely about his ankles, his knees and elbows, refusing to be confined, had
                     broken through the tender barriers that had encased them, and many an old patch
                     about his person would flap and flutter as the soft breeze whispered by him.
                     These outward evidences of decay, having penetrated no deeper than his
                     garments, exhibited his healthy and robust proportions in attractive and
                     amusing contrast. A smile of satisfaction, which many of his more fortunate and
                     prosperous neighbors might have envied, only contributed to bring out his
                     prominent lips in bolder relief, and his countenance was radiant with that
                     self-content which admires whatever is presented, and finds no fault with
                     anything but inconvenience and labor. Happily for him, his rulers were more
                     indulgent than Draco, the Athenian law-giver, who punished idleness with death,
                     and the laws under which he lived more lenient than those of the ancient Gauls,
                     which imposed a penalty upon the young for exceeding the measure of their
                     girdles, because "so large a paunch, at such early years, could proceed from
                     nothing else but laziness and gormandizing." Blessed by having been born in
                     more auspicious times, he seemed fully aware of his better destiny. Leaning
                     against the shady side of his venerable friend, in whose mute companionship he
                     so much delighted, he was looking leisurely around, as if engaged in taking the
                     exact measurement of every object that met his vision. His<pb n="210-211"
                        xml:id="VAC6407-00000106"/> easy carelessness appeared to make him oblivious
                     of the busy world, being only occasionally disturbed as he gazed, now upon some
                     blackened chimney, perhaps scenting the delicious odors of a grand Epicurean
                     feast in the ascending smoke, then upon some stately mansion, no doubt
                     pondering upon the tempting yet unattainable luxuries preparing within.</p>
                  <p>The more Peter contemplated this newly discovered subject, the more did the
                     apparent similarity in sympathies and habits to himself, elicit his admiration.
                     There is no one, thought he, so eminently wise and philosophic as the genuine
                     loafer. Whilst the rest of mankind are struggling and grasping, losing
                     to-morrow what they held with tenacious clutch to-day, this idle philosopher
                     looks calmly on and laughs at the butterfly chase. He sees his fellows
                     contending with bitterness and jealousy for a fancied good, and beholds the
                     only pleasure it could afford crushed in their own hands in their eagerness to
                     attain it. In the conflict around him, the passions of men are arrayed against
                     each other, and the good sentiments of their natures compelled to yield before
                     the concussions they encounter. It is a struggle in which he sees the most
                     vicious too often carry off the greatest prizes, whilst none retires from the
                     field without leaving a portion of his soul behind. Others may follow the
                     alluring promises which tempt them, and be carried away by the first surging
                     wave of excitement that sweeps along, he remains unmoved. Let the world go as
                     it will, he betakes himself to the sweet shade of some friendly tree, and
                     calmly, though rudely it may be, philosophises upon the vanities which dazzle
                     other eyes and bedizzen other heads, but never soften the bed of the grave, nor
                     promise repose beyond it. He knows that heaven is not to be purchased by the
                     fleeting things that charm the eye and gratify human vanity, and the harmony of
                     his spirits is never broken up in conflicts to possess them. Happily the dial
                     of time moves on, never too slow nor too fast for him, and his even temper
                     keeps him in a perpetual calm. Unmoved by the discord around him, he remains
                     content in his solitary leisure, or quietly takes his ease with his companions,
                     furnishing a worthy illustration of genuine and perfect freedom. Even Tully
                     himself could not look upon that man as properly free who had not the privilege
                     of sometimes doing nothing—a privilege rightly appreciated and justly exercised
                     only by the loafer.</p>
                  <p>As Peter was indulging in these and like reflections, the vision upon which he
                     gazed, and which had occasioned them, suddenly vanished. The rustling of the
                     leaves had aroused him from his slumber, and behold! all had been but a dream.
                     Rubbing his eyes and col<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6407-00000107"/> lecting his
                     wandering thoughts, the only realities that greeted his returning senses were
                     the hot sun above him, whose burning rays, no longer arrested by the shadow,
                     which had gradually moved in another direction had for some time been
                     illuminating his countenance, and the unpleasant recollection that the village
                     and his home were still several miles distant. To have his dreamy fancies thus
                     dispelled by such a disagreeable transition, at some other time, might have
                     urged him to the exhibition of no little ill-temper; but now he had enough to
                     occupy his mind in reflecting upon the diversified visions of his dream. These
                     he reviewed again and again, until unable to submit any longer to that itching
                     desire which so often disturbs the ease of poor mortals when they imagine they
                     have something interesting to communicate, he arose and slowly commenced the
                     exceeding great labor of walking to the village. He reached it at last, just as
                     the sun was sinking into the far west, and panting from the heat, more than
                     from the exertion, he again seated himself in front of the tavern. He had added
                     greatly to his store, and at once commenced to detail the events of his dream,
                     and from that day to this he has faithfully continued to narrate them to every
                     willing or unwilling listener</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the editor cannot see the least necessity for informing the readers of
                  the "Records" that they have now reached the end of his book, (a fact which they
                  would so certainly have discovered without his aid,) his reverence for
                  well-established precedents would not permit him to consider his volume fully
                  completed without a "Conclusion." Those who have thus far perused it, must have
                  observed that the papers it contains were the products of intervals of time stolen
                  from the regular pursuits of their authors. This, however, though it may be
                  somewhat of an apology for the imperfections of the manuscripts themselves, can
                  afford no excuse for the editor, He fully acknowledges his responsibility for all
                  the faults of the book, well knowing that he cannot be justified in thrusting it
                  before a public already so terribly afflicted with the dregs of literature, unless
                  it shall contain something to amuse or instruct. This reflection, at one time,
                  overcame his determination to send the manuscripts to the publisher. Upon more
                  mature deliberation, however, he blundered upon the conclusion, that if this be
                  not, in fact, the age of literary mediocrity, our people have so much indulged it
                  that it has, in its bold effrontery, risen to a premium and obtained greater
                  "success" (to use a publisher's term,) than over crowned the highest talent. Where
                  brave men had failed, the coward often succeeded, and thus infused<pb n="214"
                     xml:id="VAC6407-00000108"/> a boisterous and overflowing courage into the whole
                  army of little patriots, making them as presumptuous and pugilistic as the saucy
                  cur which thinks the honor lies in attacking its superiors rather than in
                  conquering them. A similar cause, it may be, has produced like effects amongst
                  authors, and the editor is by no means certain that it has not been instrumental
                  in emboldening him to send his volume forth upon its voyage. However this may be,
                  he can now only bespeak for it the treatment which the reader may think it
                  deserves—nothing more. He might perhaps have made better selections from the stock
                  on hand, but he is not certain that this would have added to the attractions of
                  the book. He can only promise, that upon the success of this volume of the
                  Records, depends the fate of the rest—whether they shall be given to the world, or
                  remain in the murky receptacles of the Old Association.</p>
