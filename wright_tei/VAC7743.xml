The mule is lhaf hoss, and haf Jackass, and then kims tu a full stop, natur diskovering her mistake. Tha weigh more, akordin tu their heft, than enny other kreetur, except a crowhar. Tha kant hear enny quicker, nor furtlher than the hoss, yet their ears are big enuff for snow shoes. You kan trust them with enny one whose life aint worthl enny more than the mules. The only wa tu keep them into a paster, is tu turn them into a rmedder jineing, and let them jump out. Tha are reddy for use, just as soon as they will du tu abuse. Tha haint got enny friends, and will live on huckel berry brush, with an ockasional chanse at Kanada thissels. Tha are a modern invenshun, i dont think the Bi- ble deludes tu them at tall. Tha sel for more money than enny other domestik animile.  Yu kant tell their age by looking into their mouth, enny more. than you kould a Mexican cannons.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7743-00000007"/> "       JOSH BILLINGS. Tha never hav no dissease that a good club wont heal. If tha ever die tha must kum rite tu life agin, for i never herd nobody sa " ded mule." Tha are like sum men, very korrupt at harte ; ive known them tu be good mules for 6 months, just tu git a good chanse to kick sumbody. I never owned one, nor never mean to, unless there is a United Staits law passed, requiring it. The only reason why tha are pashunt, is bekause tha are ashamed ov themselfs. I have seen eddikated mules in a sirkus. Tha kould Lick, and bite, tremenjis. I would not sa what I am forced tu sa again the mule, if his birth want an outrage, and man want tu blame for it. Enny man who is willing tu drive a mule, . ought to be exempt by law from running for the legislatur. Tha are the strongest creeturs on earth, and heaviest, ackording tu their sise; I herd tell ov one who fell oph from the tow path, on the Eri kanawl, and sunk as soon as ha touched bottom, but he kept rite on towing the boat tu the nex stashun, breathing thru his ears, which stuck out ov the wa- ter about 2 feet 6 inches; i did'nt see this did, but an auctioneer told mne ov it, and i never knew an auctioneer tu lie unless it was absolutely convenient.   II. JOSH BILLINGS INSURES HS LIFE. I kum to the conclusion lately, that life waz so onsartin that the only wa for me tu stand a fair chance with other folks, was to git my life insured: and so i kalled on the Agent of the Garden Angel life insurance Co.," and answered the following questions, which waz put tu me over the top ov a pair of goold specks, by a slik little fat old feller, with a little round gray head, and az pretty a little belly on him az enny man ever owned:- QUESTIONS. 1st--Are yu mail or femail? if so, Pleze state how long you have been so. 2d-Are yu subjec tu fits, and if so, do yu hav more than one at a time? 3d-What is yure precise fiteing weilght?  4th-Did yu ever have enny ancestors, and if so, how much?  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7743-00000008"/> 160    JOSH BITNGS 5th-What iz yure legal opinion ov the consti- tutionality ov the 10 commandments! 6th-Du yu ever hav enny nite mares? 7th-Are you married and single, or are yu a Bachelor?          - 8th - Do yu beleave in a futer state? if yu du, state it. 9th-What are yure private sentiments about a rush ov rats tu the head; can it be did success- fully? 10th-Hav yu ever committed suiside. and if so, how did it seem to affect yu? Aft6ter answering the above questions, like a man in the confirmatif, the slik little fat old fellow with goold specks on, ced I was insured for life, and proberly would remain so for a term ov years. I thanked him, and smiled one ov my moste pensive smiles. 4 (   "I. REMARKS. Tha tell me that them whlo hav the harte diseaze are liable tu di at enny time, but i hav known thousands tew reach a mean old age with it. Fust appearances are ced tu be everyt ing. I dont put all mi fathe into this saying; i think oysters and klams, for instanze, will bear loo'ing into. It strains a man's philosophee the wust kind tew laff when he gits beat. Love aint one ov the vartues, bekauze it kant be controlled.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. "Ameliaz."- Yure inquiry, about the moste best time tu marry, dus yu grate credit, it iz a sub- ject which i hav swet over a good deal, and i am real glad you spoke about it, mi spase wont allow me tu gro into the thing. cleah up to the hub, az i wud like tu, but in a few  wurds, i will sa, i hav alwus considered cool weather, the moste best time. "Fred.^'-Yu   aint obliged tu ask a gals moth- er, if yu ma go home with her from a partee, git the gals endorsement; and sale in; it iz proper enuff tu ask her tu take yure arm, but you haint got no rite tut put yure arm around her waste, un- less yu meet a Bear on the rode, and then yu are  ; bound tu take yure- arm away, just az soon az the Bear gits safely by.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7743-00000010"/> f    U     20       JOSH BTLLTTNGS.

"Sportsman."-Yure inquiry iz not edzackly in   ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.     21 mi line, but i haste tu repli, as follers, to wit: The rite length tu cut oph a dog's tale haz never yet bin fully diskovered, but iz undoubtedly some- whare bak - ov lliz ears, provided yu git; the dog's consent. N. B.- It aint absolutely necessara the dog's consent should be in riteing. "Kate."-I think Lord Biron waz the author ov the lines yu speke ov; 'twas either him or 'twas Captain Kid, one or .tother.

Iknu ov one old feller who waz very noshunal, he wouldn't hav a hoss only jist so high, he never stabled- him, and let him git - hiz -own fodder, he kept him for 47 years, and the- boss outlived him, the last- time I saw the boss he waz alive, but poor az wood; the old feller called the boss ' saw-buck,' and sed he waz sired bi carpenter, out ov a white ash skantlina, Hoss no- shuns are -well enuff, but -they never ought tew be allowed tew interfere with a man's final salvashun. 4K - v ,        RUM NOSHUNS.

Manifest destiny iz the science ov going tew the devil, or enny other place before yu git thare.

Mani- fest destiny mite perhaps be blocked out agin az the condishun that manh and things find themselfs in with- a ring in their nozes and sumboddy hold ov the ring. I may be rong agin, but if i am, awl i hav got tew sa iz, i don't kno it, and what a man don't kno ain't no damage tew enny boddy else. The tru way that manifess destiny had better be sot down iz, the exact distance that a frog kan jump down hill with a striped snake after him; i dont kno but i may be wrong onst more but if the frog don't git ketcthed the destiny iz jist what' he iz a looking for.                 ,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7743-00000033"/> 60        JOSH BILLINGS.

Standing behind a bull in fly time and gitting kick- ed twice at one time, must feel a good deal like man- ifess destiny. Being about 10 seckunds tew late tew git an express train, and then chasing the train with yure wife, and an umbreller in yure hands, in a hot day, and not getting az near tew the train az you waz. when yu started, looks a leetle like mani-  fess destiny on a rale rode trak. Going into a tem- pranse - house and calling for a little old Bourbon on ice, and  being told in a mild way that "the Bourbon iz jist out, but they hav got sum gin that cost 72 cents a gallon in Paris." sounds tew me like the manifess destiny ovmoste tempranse houses. Mi dear reader, don't beleave in manifess destiny untill yu see it.

If Adam didn't kiss Eve at sight he aint the man i take him tew be; and If Eve didn't relish it, it must hav bin bekause it want well did. Thare iz one thing abodu kissing in the lump, diffrent from the rest ov the fine arts and that iz, it don't require enny eddikashun tew dew it; i hav even thort that the more unedikated it waz did (provided it didn't miss the mark) the more touching it was tew behold. But- kissing is a good deal like eating; thare is not much fun (whenr a person iz hungry) in standing by, and see it did bi anuther fellow, if it iz did ever so well. It is one ov the cheapess and healthyess luxurys ov the season, and don't sho enny disposishun tew go out ov fashion, and will keep sweet in enny climate. Upon the whole, if yu examine kissing in the lump, clussly, yu will be led tew exclaim: Fustly, that it iz as easy tew hav It did, az it is handy tew dew it. Sekundly, that it is like Cowpers tea, it cures a man without corning him; and, Thirdly, it is a frugal, highly consentrated, and reverend luxury.

The Lone Widder iz ginerally sele- brated for her piety, she haz passed the middle ov life, she knows she haz got gra hairs in her bed, she will tell her age, and talks tenderla ov her ded husband. Her grief iz sober, her weeds are rank, if she iz ritch, she is charitable, if she is poor, she is humble. She seldum marrys the sekund time. Her cheerfulness never bekums gayety, and her sorrow never bekums lamentashun. If she has children, she treats them as the partners ov her bereavment, if she has none, she bends down tew those she meets as she wud tew the arly flower in her pathway. Her hole life is a glora tew her sek, and an honour evra da tew him whose good memory amung men she perpetuates.   y ON WIDDERS.        141 The Grass Widder is marrid without enny husband. She keeps house at a hotel, and kalls the servants bi familiar names. She sez that her huiand is a kur- nel in the armee. Her thesis is unkongenial temp- raments, she kan repeat Don Juan, and hides Boc- cassio's tales under her pillow. If she wud ride out she orders a coach, and a gentleman; if she is ritch, she is arrogant if she is poor, she is brasen. She kalls virtue prudery, and sez she wouldn't swop chas- tity with Dianner. If her kurnel is fortunate enuff tew git shot in battle, yu ma meet her and hiz Lu- tenant at Nuport nex summer, marrid -for the season. The Star Spanilgled Widder iz yung, ornamental, and-a fule.

It is a fust rate wa tew court the girl's mother a leetle on the start, for there iz one thing a woman never despizes, and that iz, a leettle good courting, if it is dun strikly on the square. After the fust year yu will begin to be well ackquainted and will begin tew like the bizzness.
