                  <head type="sub">IN THE STREET.</head> 
                  <p>THE earnest-minded people of old time, who found this world of God too vast for them-in its liberties and responsibilities-made an odd mistake, both in their apprehension of life, and in their endeavors to help themselves through it, and out of it. They proved that retirement and solitude are not dependant on isolation; that pride, selfishness, and lust, denounced by them as vices peculiar to the world, are devils not cast out by the assumption of a monk's dress.</p> 
                  <p>The old apple-woman back of her stand on the corner of the street, proves, in her own way, what history has been proving these many hundred years, that solitude, and retirement, and renunciation of the world, do not necessitate a stone-wall, and chains of beads.</p> 
                  <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6043-00000004"/> 
                  <p>Look at that sleep, now. With your doors bolted, and your strong name acting sentinel, do you slumber more securely? Is your solitude more silent? True, her little girl is by her side-little Jess, her grand-daughter-the child of her daughter Jessie, who is dead. And hundreds of carts, carriages, and stages, go up and down before her, hour after hour, and men and women, numberless, pass by, but she is blind, and deaf, and dumb, in the soundness of her slumber.</p> 
                  <p>Even when she is awake she is almost as much alone as now. If addressed, she hears and answers-if any one stops at her stand, she sees-if the price of anything is asked, she hears. If it begins to rain, she raises the big umbrella which protects her goods. If Jess speaks, she answers, but she comes out of her abstractions and returns to them again like one pledged to their service.</p> 
                  <p>The little girl left to her care when an infant, is seven years old. She has grown now to be a help to her grandmother. The old woman used to doze through the afternoon; now, as you see, she sleeps, and Jess takes care of the stand. It is the happiest period of the old creature's life. She and the child are up with the dawn, their table is spread from the market before the noise and stir of the streets begin. They talk together, children both, till the business tide sets in, and after that comes the long time of napping. Not now, as once, are her tired senses kept on the alert; she knows that when she wakens at nightfall Jess will give into her hand the money she has taken; will help her home with the remainder of the goods; will make the fire, if fire is to be made; and wait upon her, proud to be employed as long as she, the grandam, can think of anything she would have done.</p> 
                  <p>The little girl is a trustworthy child. She is such by nature. I know not that any great effort has been made to bring about the good result. But she runs on faithfully through her duties, as a clock strikes through the hours. She never stirs from her place by the stand, except upon some errand. She rests against her grandmother's chair, or sits on the pavement, when she is tired-and when she is hungry she thinks of the supper in the evening-and contents herself therewith. There is an apparent protection in the presence of the old woman; the child may feel it as such, but how real the protection can be, the reader may infer.</p> 
                  <p>The sense of her responsibility, the knowledge of what is expected of her, has quickened every perception that would be called into use by this sort of training. The girl's round eyes have brightened-her small features sharpened-and her little nervous figure grows constantly more definite in the expression of its care.</p> 
                  <p>Time is a faithful artist; our mortal being is as the block of marble in the sculptor's hands. We come at length in ourselves to perfectly express the spirit that is in us. This is one reason why we look with awe upon the dead. Do those features tell no tale? and<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6043-00000005"/> there is no voice to dissipate the judgment of the gazer, none to reverse it. Our spirit in that Day of Judgment, in its inevitable betrayal, meets its just and changeless sentence. Time is explaining little Jess to all that care to see. She is so quick and bright an image as she stands by the side of the dozing old woman, her youth and eagerness contrast so broadly with that age and exhaustion, and the poverty of both unite them so intimately, that of those who stroll idly along the city race-course, some pause, now and then, with curious or inquiring interest, to look at her. She is so small to stand there before hagglers in the market. When hunger looks to make a choice of stalls, it often buys of Jess-perhaps to take advantage of her youth; perhaps, it does one good to think it may be so, for pity's sake; because it is as natural for the poor to pity the poor, as it is for the rich to envy the rich; or, as it is for men of talent to slander men of genius.</p> 
                  <p>Jess is faithful to her trust. Sometimes, on account of this very faithfulness, she is perplexed and troubled. It is pitiful to see the child's face on such occasions. But she rarely, even in the most desperate emergencies, calls on the old woman for advice. She relies on her own resources, and the law of our being serves the little girl as well as it does mightier intellects on their mightier occasions. The generous service of her faculties is rendered in proportion to the confidence with which she makes demands upon them.</p> 
                   
                  <p>But it happened one day, that a youth went sauntering down the street, and seeing the watchful child, and the sleeping old woman, he made a halt before the stand, and began to bargain with young Jess.</p> 
                  <p>"How much are those apples?" said he, looking down at the pile that occupied the most conspicuous portion of the board-the tempting centre of the poor display.</p> 
                  <p>"Two cents apiece," was the prompt answer, given with a quick, bright look of expectancy, so proud was she of those apples. During all that season nothing to compare with them had been seen upon that board.</p> 
                  <p>"Too much-you can buy them anywhere for a cent."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm willing," replied Jess, in a tone the very reverse of that with which she spoke, before. She spoke looking everywhere except into the idle fellow's face. Then followed a silence.</p> 
                  <p>"How much did you say?" asked he again, at length; this time taking up one of the apples, the crown of the pile.</p> 
                  <p>"Two cents," replied Jess, in a louder voice than before. At which the youth laughed. He understood her tone-the vexation-but not the underlying disappointment. More and more distrustful of his purpose, Jess answered the laugh by requesting him to put down the apple, or the money.</p> 
                  <p>He laughed again at that, and said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Don't be in a hurry. You're here to sell your goods, ain't you?"</p> 
                  <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6043-00000006"/> 
                  <p>There was no answer made to this insolent interrogatory; but another long pause followed; it was broken finally by Jess saying:-</p> 
                  <p>"Do you want to buy that apple?"</p> 
                  <p>"It's a fair one," meditated he aloud; "but the difficulty is, it costs too much."</p> 
                  <p>"We paid that for 'em in the market," expostulated she; "we bought 'em because they was so fine. Put that down, and go ask, if you want to," and the worried child lifted her hand as if to take the treasure from him. Vain effort! vain as that of the millions struggling to-day up the Parnassus heights, which poets reach by flight.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, I'm in no such hurry!" said he; making, while he spoke, a circle of finger-prints around the red pride and glory of the table, to the child's increasing dismay. She put out her hand again as if to take it from him. To appeal to her grandmother did not enter her thoughts. She did not consider even the use of so doing-so strong had her habit of self-reliance become.</p> 
                  <p>As she raised her hand the fellow stepped back from the stand; that drew Jess out upon the sidewalk, and if the folly of her strife with him became apparent at that moment, it was not to her own eyes, when she stood so little and so slight, confronting this great bully, not so much brute as wanton in his miserable sport.</p> 
                  <p>Sitting on a box further up the street was an observer of this contest, who, at its present stage of progress, thought proper to draw near and take a part in it. When she saw the little girl come out from behind the stand, and the youth lift his arm, she understood the whole, and ran forward, flourishing her broom, as an Indian might his war-club.</p> 
                  <p>"Begone!" cried she in precisely the tone, but with vastly more emphasis of action than that employed by the queen she saw upon the boards last night.</p> 
                  <p>At the sound, the youth who had not yet seen the speaker, turned on his heel, and beheld.</p> 
                  <p>He looked at the girl a moment as if doubting in himself as to the propriety of yielding at such a bidding-but she repeated the solitary mandate in a way that served to dissipate his doubts on the subject, so he dropped the apple, big coward that he was, and went leisurely away. Swift vengeance pursued him for this act, and it overtook him, I delight in telling. The street-sweeper waited only to snatch the apple from the pavement, and she was on his track; and describing, with her broom, a wild circle above his head, she whirled his hat into the centre of the street, and the wheel of a stage, rolling over it, gave the act a heavy endorsement and underscoring of approval.</p> 
                  <p>The youth turned savagely upon his adversary at this stroke, but she had now turned away from him, and was retracing her steps-not retreating: that slow march toward the applewoman's stand was not like a retreat. He stood, as if with doubtful purpose,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6043-00000007"/> looking after her a moment, and then, bent his steps toward the nearest by-street, and so disappeared: conforming his conduct, no doubt, to the urgent convictions of his judgment. When the girl went back to the stand she stood a moment, making a mute survey of the table, and the old woman, to whose wakened senses Jess was relating what had happened. Jess stopped short in the story as the defender came near; but the defender only said with a laugh:-"You're a little one; don't try to fight with a big boy again; you'll likely come off the worst. But didn't his hat catch it!"</p> 
                  <p>"Take an apple-do, dear," cried the old woman, waked up as she had not been before that day; and in her eagerness to express her gratitude she even got up and hobbled out to the preserver of her rights, and offered an apple with her knotty, cramped, old fingers.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, I don't want it," said Philly, with a bow, and a smile one smiles to think about.</p> 
                  <p>"Do now," pleaded Jess, astonished and delighted at her grandmother's courtesy, lifting up both hands as she spoke in a way that made Philly think she had been educated for a beggar; such an emphasis was in the voice, such pleading in the little, red, scrawny hand. But Jess had never been a beggar; she was to "the manner born," or else her keen observation had seized upon the features of some successful pleader's method, and memory had retained them until this opportunity of exercise.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I don't eat 'em," said Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" they both exclaimed, and they were sincere in the regret the word expressed.</p> 
                  <p>Then Philly-this avenging knight of the broom was called Philly in the streets, and Philly by whomsoever knew her on this earth-she, having no more to say, and plenty to do, took up her broom, and went on down the street.</p> 
                  <p>Thenceforward, each succeeding day, this girl, strong-limbed, clear-eyed, black-haired, a girl of twelve or twenty years, a sweeper of crossings, and therefore in all probability nearer twelve than twenty, every day this Philly took the huckster's stall in her round of observation-sometimes from afar off she watched the little Jess, but oftener she came near, and exchanged some words with her and the old woman. Sometimes, when it rained, she would sit down in the shelter of the big umbrella, and count her earnings, and eat her loaf; so that soon Jess fell into the habit of expecting Philly at the close of day. When Philly found that out, she seldom occasioned disappointment to the child. Often she would take the place of the tired girl at the stand, and, holding her in her arms, she made the best of saleswomen. The old woman was sure to wake up when she came; for she discovered in that presence that there was something more refreshing to wornout age than sleep. So full of kindly helpfulness was Philly toward this couple, this infancy and old age of partnership. She<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6043-00000008"/> swept in upon their silence like a gush of melody; she set all things to rights; she made the days seem prosperous; they forgot if they had been overreached in a bargain, or if they had been robbed out and out, or if the wind had blown from the east-forgot everything in the refreshing satisfaction brought by that strong-hearted, cheerful, and considerate creature, who regarded personal discomfort and fatigue no more than a philosopher.</p> 
                  <p>Her feats of strength were miracles to Jess. With what a grace of hearty good will she slung the old woman's chair over her shoulders, tucked the big umbrella under her arm, and in her hand carried the old basket in which nightly they packed what remained of the apples, and cakes, and candies, they had exposed that day for sale! What an invaluable assistant in those nightly removals was Philly! how she walked off, never bending so much as an inch under the burdens she assumed! and, behind her, with what admiring astonishment, and relieved responsibility, walked the old woman and little Jess; Jess carrying Philly's broom, almost tripping along the pavement, like <emph>any</emph> happy little girl.</p> 
                  <p>It was in this way-human friendship generally admits of explanatory elucidation-in this way that between this old woman, young girl, and little child, a friendship quite beautiful to see, grew strong: grew stronger day by day. There was something real in it; though the circumstances of it did not admit of much refined embellishment. Philly had the feeling that this old age and infancy, helpless as it was, demanded her attention-and so she freely gave it. They received it. Slight facts, and yet, the issue of eternal principles!</p> 
                  <p>The little girl fell ill one day. Drenched by summer rains, scorched by summer suns, frozen with winter frosts, and unable to endure, she disappeared at length from the corner, because she could neither stand nor sit there longer. Because she had exhausted the slender stock of vital strength with which she came into the world. Of course, then, she must die. For death is the exhaustion of vitality. A miracle had revived her-but only a miracle. So she crept into her grandmother's bed for rest and sleep-for rest and sleep, till Death, gentle and loving friend of honest poverty and childhood, should come and waken her. And after she had disappeared from the street; you might have seen Philly taking her place there, day after day, in the afternoon; sitting at that stand; relieving the old woman that she might go home and look after little Jess; doing a neighbor's work indeed.</p> 
                  <p>Here in the outset let me state that I am not writing a tale of poverty to draw any reader's tears. Far from it. I only wish to illustrate a sacred truth that Christ proclaimed. When I go among the Fejees on a mission, I shall send back no report. I have ascertained precisely the value of sensibilities stirred<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6043-00000009"/> up by story-telling. Shall an oyster moving in his shell think thereupon that he has done God service?</p> 
                  <p>The griefs of the old grandmother were peculiar to her lot only as they are to the mortal lot. Many tears she wept, no doubt, beside that wooden box in which her daughter Jessie's little Jess lay tossing, moaning:-now burning up with fever-now shivering in the chill: it was a grievous thing in her case, as it has been proved ten thousand thousand times from palace down to cellar, a grievous thing for age to watch the death of youth. The child had been a care to the old woman in infancy, but since that time an ever-growing comfort. Of late they had been like partners and companions in the business of life. Jess, indeed, had seemed like the senior member of the firm, had learned to rely on herself more and more. Philly, with her deep knowledge of the world, was the child's guide and pattern; and the old woman was content to see her anxieties departing one by one, without inquiring after them, and she forgot the youth of Jess, and trusted to her as she would have trusted to a son.</p> 
                  <p>So it had turned out as any thoughtful person might have predicted. The short race was all run. There had been some enjoyment in it:-a good deal of striving, and anxiety, and pride, and ambition, crowded into the career, and now these were to operate no longer on Jess in this world. She was advanced to another and a higher form, and all that remained for her was to draw a final breath. The old woman would say to Philly, when she came home at night bringing the furniture of the stall, and the money she had taken, say to her night after night, "There's no use-Jess is going."</p> 
                  <p>Then Philly, hopeful always, would cheer up the poor soul with some consolation. Jess would be sure to mend-she was only worn out-she wanted rest; or, some of the medicine Philly had brought for her was going to work a marvel of a cure. But, in spite of all these sayings, the fever raged and raged, and even Philly, who watched the child night after night, failed after a while to interest or amuse her. At last the mind of Jess seemed to vanish among the clouds and mists of a strange delirium, and it never returned again. She died silently, with her eyes fixed on Philly, who had fallen asleep by her bedside; when Philly wakened, the little girl had nothing more to say to her.</p> 
                  <p>So, between them, the old woman and Philly saw the child laid in a grave. And this incident is one of the most recent in the street-sweeper's story at the time of this tale's opening.</p> 
                  <p>The sort of guardianship she had exercised over the young child and old grandmother, operated upon Philly as such a care, thus assumed, could not fail to operate on the thoughts and the affections of the self-constituted protector.</p> 
                  <p>It had not increased her energy nor her courage; in these respects she needed no increase. But by living<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6043-00000010"/> sympathy with the bereft old apple-vender, and that watching over helpless Jess, Philly came into consciousness of her true woman nature; became gentler than she had been; more pitiful; her voice grew kindlier. She meant it, when she said to the old woman:-</p> 
                  <p>"I'll never lose sight of you. I'll help you home every night with your things. I can't be with you allers, as she was-but I'll be round, most like, within call, somewhere, when you want me."</p> 
                  <p>She not only meant these promises-she kept them. But the time soon came when, to remember them, there was no longer need. For the old woman followed little Jess, and Jessie, the child's mother, after a brief separation. Philly's promise, however, had been redeemed. She was "round," "within call," during the last days of the old woman's public service-"round, within call," on the day of the old woman's death-"round, within call," at her time of burial;-and if a tear fell on that coffin which enclosed the poor body that had toiled and endured so long, it fell from the eyes of youth, and hope, and courage-from Philly's eyes.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">IN THE CELLAR.</head> 
                  <p>FRUITS and flowers invariably bear relation to their soil. Sahara has no oak, and Labrador no spicy damask roses. The physical fact has its perfect moral respondent. Fine houses are the index of their region; you will not look for palaces in swamps, nor yet in Little-Water street.</p> 
                  <p>Absolute villany no oftener walks about in rags than in robes-(and saying this we need not be considered as upholding the poor as instructors of the rich in morals);-absolute vice, perfect as its parallel with insanity may be, is generally fed, clothed, and in its right mind.</p> 
                  <p>I am led into these reflections as Alley No. 12 opens before my <unclear>mind,</unclear> and I see old Abraham Black making his way toward it.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham might have been taken for a representative man in that alley-but he was not a sign-board of vice. He was merely a good evidence of what poverty can do for a man who is destitute of special aspiration, or ignorant or careless in respect of his rights, and born without the temperament that seeks somehow, in vice, or virtue, positive expression of itself.<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6043-00000011"/> He had struggled along in a decent way from day to day, and from year to year, and would probably continue to do so eternally, if time did not put a stop to the necessity.</p> 
                  <p>His old, old clothes, were part and parcel of him. They seemed to be his natural, and therefore his most appropriate covering. You would never have thought of offering charity to him. The dingy cellars in which he had lived all his life surrounded him like an atmosphere, and they had wrought perhaps as certain a result. The earth was very solid under him, and probably had he been called upon to take an oath he would have sooner sworn by it than by the heavens above him. Do not regard Abraham as a monster in this. We do not call things monstrous that are common.</p> 
                  <p>The old man has run no race. The prizes of life were never proclaimed in his hearing. He has therefore had no call to struggle for them. He understands himself moderately well, asks no questions, makes no reflections, it would seem. He has never been a drunkard, thief, or in any ways felonious. What has hindered him? He has been able to work and earn his daily bread. Anywhere he would have led a life of abstinence. He would have been anywhere contented, quiet, at ease.</p> 
                  <p>From time to time he has made a change in his habitation-sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. He is equal to almost anything in the way of hardship. Things have gone on with him in a certain fashion from one year's end to another. The days have come and departed, and he has kept his soul and body together, now for forty years. Only forty years; but he looks as if he might have been born almost any time since Noah's flood.</p> 
                  <p>He has achieved the reputation of a patriarch among his kind. While population has continually shifted around him, he is one among the few whom it is possible to identify. He is a veteran of unimpeachable respectability. Many a man younger than himself has he seen rising from the ranks; rising by one doubtful method, or another, from place to place, bettering his fortunes with each remove. If these facts ever commanded his attention-firing him with energy-it was but for a moment, as if he were under some galvanic influence, and he has returned to the old ways, and plodded on.</p> 
                  <p>His trade was not favorable to the spirit of speculation. By day he went about the streets with an iron hook, pursuing discoveries among barrels of refuse, and he followed the course of the sewer, and dragged the city drains for treasure. It was not a very elevating labor. At night he overlooked his stock, and took it to the dealers in such goods, secured his earnings, and went home to bed.</p> 
                  <p>Now in such a life there was no very exhilarating influence. The profession of Abraham could not make, of any man that followed it, a very brilliant character. Events have the disposal of the most of men.<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6043-00000012"/> This is lamentably true. Or how should we see so much that is incompetent, illustrating, by feebleness of action, the greatness of design?</p> 
                  <p>The porter would not, perhaps, drop imbecile into his grave. His life might be wakened yet. There was a chance for him. Perhaps there was something to wake up-and less than the trump of death might do it. He had kept to the wall and skulked along his way. Perhaps he might come out, and stand up, and look into heaven, and say yet, in the pride of his humility, "In the image of God, I am a man." Who would dare prophecy? Where are the prophets? What far-seeing eye beheld the career of Louis Napoleon? or who, in vision, saw Victoria impersonating England at the grave of Bonaparte?</p> 
                  <p>Abraham, strange as it might have seemed to the people who saw him prowling about those barrels and drains, was on the earth for a purpose. Do you count it a small thing, that impulse which led him so often to extend his helping hand to others, him, to whom no hand of helper had ever been extended? He obeyed the impulse, as brutes obey their instinct. Voluntary free-will offerings were his charities! honor to old Abraham!</p> 
                  <p>Good deeds are quite often done for very shame's sake, and for no other reason. You are too proud to receive gifts by every breeze of heaven, and offer nothing in return. Such was not Abraham's charity-his good deeds made the poor old scavenger's whole life honorable, and set a crown of glory on his head; they redeemed what had else been but a dull version of the "poetry of life."</p> 
                  <p>I called Abraham the porter of Alley No. 12; because he lived in the cellar of the first building of the lane; and because, being so thoroughly rooted and grounded in poverty, he seemed fit for the station.</p> 
                  <p>But he was a new-comer to the alley though he had lived in its neighborhood many years. He had now come hither for a lodging, because his old home was to be pulled down to make room for a better building.</p> 
                  <p>It was on the night of his removal that Philly descended the cellar-steps, unaware of the change made in the occupants of the cellar back of which was the dark room where she had slept since she could remember.</p> 
                  <p>Rushing down, according to her custom, with the broom over her shoulders, her head wrapped in her shawl, and her clothes dripping with the pouring rain, she broke in upon Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>He had kindled a fire in his stove, and sat, warming himself, before it, smoking, when she appeared. There was nothing that could happen to either of them that would much startle, or astonish; and so when Philly came down with a laugh-for she had a companion as far as her door-with a laugh and a leap that landed her half way across the cellar, she stood only a moment looking about her in surprise. Then<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6043-00000013"/> she shut the door, and went up to the stove, and put her hands against the pipe, and warmed them; surveying Abraham meanwhile; and he, in turn, sat surveying her.</p> 
                  <p>She was the first to speak. Leaning her broom against the wall, she pushed back her hair, and prepared herself. She had measured him from head to foot, and made her estimate.</p> 
                  <p>"What's this?" said she, speaking with no great deference.</p> 
                  <p>"Sure enough," he remarked coolly, and went on smoking.</p> 
                  <p>"I live here," she explained.</p> 
                  <p>"So do I," said Abraham indifferently, hardly looking at her. He did not like her manners.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you expect me to move? I've lived here this ten year, and more."</p> 
                  <p>"They told me this here room was empty," said Abraham, taking his pipe from his mouth, and instantly replacing it. That was all he knew about it, and consequently all he had to say.</p> 
                  <p>"This here," said Philly explaining, "this here was the old woman's room-mine is yonder. Did you take 'em both?"</p> 
                  <p>"No-you can keep your room, if you want to. The woman's gone, and I'm here. It's mine now as long as I pay for it."</p> 
                  <p>After a contemplative silence, Philly said: "Do you keep this here stove a going here all the time?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Nights, if it's cold."</p> 
                  <p>"May I sit down here?"</p> 
                  <p>"Why not?"</p> 
                  <p>So Philly took off her wet shawl, and spread it on the ground under the stove, and sat herself down on a block of wood, and Abraham went on smoking.</p> 
                  <p>When he had finished the pipe, he shook out the ashes, and put it in his pocket, and leaning forward spread his hands over the stove.</p> 
                  <p>"What sort of a girl be you?" said he, and it is a noteworthy fact that a question of this description had never escaped his lips before.</p> 
                  <p>"Goodish," answered Philly promptly, looking the old man in the face.</p> 
                  <p>"You're a sweeper?" said he musing, looking at her broom.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"How does it go?"</p> 
                  <p>"Easy;" and Philly laughed a laugh that sent half the shadows out of the room, the fire had made her so comfortable.</p> 
                  <p>"You're in allers o'nights?" he questioned seriously.</p> 
                  <p>"When I ain't out," she assured him. But when Philly had said this she looked at the old man, and after that corrected her answer by adding, "I go to the dance: that's the place for lonesome folks who want to keep warm."</p> 
                  <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6043-00000014"/> 
                  <p>"You had better be home," said he soberly but kindly.</p> 
                  <p>"That's the place for fun!" she expostulated.</p> 
                  <p>"We're all there."</p> 
                  <p>"You'd better be asleep," he ventured to say; with some timidity it seemed.</p> 
                  <p>"Work all day, and sleep all night? No, <emph>sir</emph>. I want a little comfort."</p> 
                  <p>"Sit here by my stove, then; 'twixt us both I guess we can keep it going. I allers have a fire in the winter."</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you," said Philly. It sounded like an acceptance of his invitation. And, after the common fashion, she respected the old man so much the more that he was able to afford that luxury and extravagance of fire all the winter.</p> 
                  <p>"Them dancing places ain't fit for you, if you're a good girl," said the old man, speaking with an effort.</p> 
                  <p>"That's because he's old, and can't dance himself," was Philly's private comment. But she spoke out, ready for an argument:-</p> 
                  <p>"There's nothing to hate though."</p> 
                  <p>"You was never about, then, when they got into a muss, I guess-a regular fight." Abraham was calling to mind the solitary occasion of attempt on his part to make a festivity out of life.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I have," said she quickly, not willing that any one should suppose she was not thoroughly acquainted with all that was going on in the world.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"What did you do? Was you in?"</p> 
                  <p>"No: I got out of the way, and come home;" but she was not proud of that fact, for she added: "I oughter stayed, and seen it out."</p> 
                  <p>"When are you going again?"</p> 
                  <p>"To-night, I was."</p> 
                  <p>"You look tired," said Abraham kindly.</p> 
                  <p>"I ain't....</p> 
                  <p>"But I don't mind if I stay," she added voluntarily, since he did not persuade her. "It rains so."</p> 
                  <p>"What have you got to eat?" said he, rousing up, after awhile.</p> 
                  <p>She held up to observation the part of a coarse loaf.</p> 
                  <p>"Sit here and eat it, if you want to."</p> 
                  <p>And then the old man, by a strange mistake, filled his pipe again, and smoked it over; and he enjoyed it better than the first pipe, for it pleased him to see the girl sitting there. Her voice, her gayety, were cheering to him, though he had no clear perception of the fact-for he was not given to the observation of causes and effects.</p> 
                  <p>So Philly ate her bread, and invited the old man to share it with her. At first he declined, out of pure generosity, but she said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Come, don't be offish; if I sit by your stove, you eat my bread."</p> 
                  <p>There was no resisting this voice, so Abraham took the loaf, and broke off a small portion of it, though<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6043-00000015"/> at the same time he assured her that he had supped, and then she received the loaf back, and ate it with great deliberation and composure.</p> 
                  <p>When she had finished her meal, and he his pipe, they fell into a long and easy conversation, which had more novelty for Abraham than Philly, for never before, in his life, had he held so long a talk with one of womankind.</p> 
                  <p>Philly sat opposite him, thawed into excellent humor by the stove-heat, and she talked over her fortunes as she had never felt tempted to do before. The old woman, who had shared the dark basement with her, had always monopolized the interest of the evening conversations Philly held with her. The old man was different; he seemed disposed to hear her talk about herself-and then he was quiet and kind. Her own fortunes having been so long a time pushed into the background, as unworthy of mention, now made the subject of conversation, what wonder if she ran on to the verge of fiction in her narrative? that living in the present as she did, there should be some difficulty in the way to her distinct observation of the past?</p> 
                  <p>It was a barren history at best-even with all her embellishment-meagre as the drapery in Scheffer's pictures, and its coloring was as poor.</p> 
                  <p>But it was a wonderfully interesting tale to Abraham. It kept him awake while she was telling it, that or her fine rich voice, or the fact that some one was really addressing all this long talk to him.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Philly's character came out in the telling of the tale, as Abraham's in the listening. On her mishaps and privations she dwelt with a forgiving spirit-with far more merriment than pathos-for their humorous, rather than their tragic, bearing, had made impression on her mind, and was uppermost in her recollection. She dwelt not on the long, cold winters-on the hunger and the nakedness, the lonely defencelessness of her condition. She, had endured want of every kind that could pertain to her lot-but want had not embittered her. She had seen more good than evil days; the brief hours of the jovial dance stood out more prominent among her memories than all the days of want, or danger, or perplexity, she had endured. More gladness than gloom was in the world for her; and her story, by the telling of it, ran warm, invigorating, like wine, through the soul of Abraham. So he sat and looked at Philly, and smiled on her while she talked. There was something genuine in his laugh, when she brought him once or twice to that extremity. It was low, sweet, and contagious. The first time she heard it Philly stopped short in her story and looked at him, doubting-could it be he?-the second time she joined him in it: softly as he laughed she echoed, and the sound was silvery sweet. Ah, "<foreign xml:lang="ITA">bella voce d'argento,</foreign>" that makes me think of you!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE BALL-ROOM BELLE.</head> 
                  <p>IN the course of the evening Abraham was made still more appreciative of the hours that were passing.</p> 
                  <p>While Philly was in the midst of her story the door unceremoniously opened, and a figure came cautiously down from the darkness of the stormy night, and advanced a step or two into the cellar, as if a certain knowledge of the way were yet attended by some sort of uncertainty. Philly understood it.</p> 
                  <p>She saw and perceived, and said, without moving from the stove-</p> 
                  <p>"Not to-night, Jim."</p> 
                  <p>"We're a waiting for you, ma'am," and the figure that spoke advanced.</p> 
                  <p>"Not to-night," she repeated without stirring. "This here old gentleman's stove keeps me warm, tell 'em, and I'm tired. Don't you hear it rain too? And I've been out all day."</p> 
                  <p>"There'll be no fun then this night. The boys and girls are all there, lots of 'em."</p> 
                  <p>"Cause they hain't got no better place. I have," said Philly with a decision that left no room for argument. But still the boy was urgent. As he came nearer to the stove Abraham perceived that he was as curious a piece of mortal deformity as ever walked alone. From the manner in which his poor head was planted between his shoulders it seemed, in the dim light of the room, as though his long lank arms might be the pendants of his ears-and the bulk of his unfortunate body was drawn into a round ball on his back, that might remind one of a monster of old furniture resting on legs an infant's hands could clasp.</p> 
                  <p>"You've gone out worse nights than this," he persisted.</p> 
                  <p>"'Cause I'd nothing to home. Don't keep 'em waiting, Jim-go tell 'em I'm tired. They won't miss me."</p> 
                  <p>"Devil they won't! Maybe if this here old gentleman knowed about it, he'd gin you leave." The boy may not have been as cunning as these words seem to indicate-but he could have used none that would serve his purpose better. If anything could draw her out, the hint that she was not free to go would do it. Precious as life, was liberty to Philly.</p> 
                  <p>If he calculated, however, on carrying his point, Jim was doomed to disappointment.</p> 
                  <p>"It's no leave I want from man or woman," she said impatiently, rising and speaking as one who would be obeyed. "Get out with you, Jim, and do your errand. I'll dance when I will, and I won't when I won't do you hear?"</p> 
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6043-00000017"/> 
                  <p>"I ain't deaf I guess. That's what I'll tell 'em to the dance"-muttered Jim; he would have threatened her, had he dared.</p> 
                  <p>"It isn't what you'll tell 'em," answered Philly-perfectly assured. "Say I'm tired, Jim. It's the truth." By the change in her voice and manner, she did not one whit derogate from her command, and yet she urged her request in a way that Jim, for the life of him, could not resist. Her final words put further argument out of his mind. "Be a good boy," said she, "and run back, and you'll be my partner next time I come. I won't forget-Philly never forgets. Go-will you?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'm off," said the boy, and he was true to his word while he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"Look out for your stove now, old gentleman," said Philly to Abraham gayly. "If they find out what keeps me they'll be like to let you know. 'Twouldn't be the first smash on my account."</p> 
                  <p>Then she sat down, very likely with a little maiden vanity, and she prepared to go on with the story which had been interrupted.</p> 
                  <p>The old man was ready now to listen as he had not listened before. Her decision in the matter of the evening entertainment gratified the old fellow. He folded his hands with satisfaction while she spoke, and contemplated the warm stove that had detained her; but the stove you will bear in mind was regarded by him as only another self. An expression-a reflection tion of himself. Therefore it was himself that had detained her.</p> 
                  <p>Philly spoke now more slowly, more weightily than she had done before-as if she were drifting toward the point round which her life revolved-so that Abraham felt it. And he was ready for any anticipation when she said, looking at him gravely:-</p> 
                  <p>"Was you ever sick?"</p> 
                  <p>He was not quick enough to perceive that in reality Philly was not curious on that subject-that she was not interrogating for information, but advancing a point from which some personal deductions were to be drawn.</p> 
                  <p>"No," said he, "I've had pretty tolerable health, thank ye. Have you?"</p> 
                  <p>"All but the fever."</p> 
                  <p>"The fever!" as if there were something quite uncommon, quite curious in that.</p> 
                  <p>"Down five weeks with it. Typhus-never lifted my head up."</p> 
                  <p>"In there?" asked Abraham, too honest to make any further demonstration of surprise, for it was really no such astounding piece of news, as Philly seemed to deem it. He had seen scores of people down with fever-had known of scores that died of it. So he made a little diversion from the fact absolute to the facts relative, and asked if it was "in there" that she had the fever.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," and Philly seemed lost in thought as she answered.</p> 
                  <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6043-00000018"/> 
                  <p>Then Abraham made another effort.</p> 
                  <p>"Who took care of you? the old woman?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim-the old woman kind o' kep an eye on me, but it was Ephrim that paid her for't. He did better by her than he oughter. It was his self that did the taking care-a'most."</p> 
                  <p>"Who is Ephrim?" asked the old man.</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim! Don't you know?" Where could Abraham have lived all his days? "He drives a stage. He's the highest man you meet. As high agin as you, may be. And strong, sir, he could shake your life out of you at one grip. He'd no more mind about liftin' me up and bringing me out here for a change when I was getting better, than if I'd been a babe."</p> 
                  <p>"I guess I must have seen him," observed Abraham, meditating.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course you have," said Philly, quite confident. "Everybody knows him. There ain't a man that can look greater. I've seen men turn pale at his fierce looks-but no one ever saw <emph>me</emph> afeard before him. That's what they'll all tell you." Again she mused-and Abraham felt more and more that he could not afford the silence.</p> 
                  <p>"How did he come to be doin' that for you when you'd the fever?" asked Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll tell you," said Philly. "It had been some days-I was feeling miserable. I dragged myself out, and I dragged myself in, but all the work I did wasn't enough to 'arn my bread, if I hadn't lost my liking for it. One night I was a coming home, and just as I got here by the steps I fell-it seemed to me as I'd been a falling all along the street. He was right to my back-and he picked me up. 'What's the matter?" says he. 'I'm going to die, I guess,' says I, and I thought I was, for sure. Where do you live?' says he then. I knew I was just by the steps. But I couldn't speak, I just pointed. And then he picked me up and brung me down. There wasn't a day after that but he was in. He brung me stuff to take, and he made the old woman stay in to look after me. 'For she's worth saving,' says he. When I was getting better he'd come in sometimes with everything that you can think of, to eat. And fresh water from the pump, a pailful at a time-bless your soul-and would rub my hands and face with it, when they was burnt up so." Here she paused a moment to take breath, and then went on, still more rapidly.</p> 
                  <p>"I used to wait for him-and I could tell when he was coming. I knew. It seemed as if I could hear him on the walk before .. What?"</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't say nothing," said Abraham, in a meek voice, that was in perfect contrast with that sharp demand of hers.</p> 
                  <p>"I thought you laughed," she remarked, more mildly.</p> 
                  <p>"I didn't."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, don't. For it's true, I knew if he was a coming, afore he turned the corner to the alley. I<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6043-00000019"/> felt it. Oh, it made up for the long day, when he did come. He told such stories, and made me laugh. And big and strong as he was, he was more like a woman round, than the old woman was. She was allers wide awake when <emph>he</emph> come, but she slept the rest o' the time-a'most of it, poor creetur. Sometimes I'd be a thinking when he come it would be wise to give it up, and be done with living-but he said, 'Hang on, Philly.' So I hung on. I couldn't help it, when he bid me. But if it hadn't been for him I'd a died sure. More's the pity, I think, sometimes."</p> 
                  <p>She sighed, saying this, and looked at the old man. He said nothing; but she saw him lift his hand and draw it across his eyes; and that made her feel very kindly toward him-drawn toward him, as it were.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you a crying?" she asked, to make it all plain. And secretly she hoped he was.</p> 
                  <p>"I dare say the fever did you good in the long run," said he, trying to speak out "like a man."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said she slowly, taking a survey of the advantages, and generous to enumerate them. "I'm stronger-and there's Eph to know about, and it's through him I went to the dances...I hope he ain't there to night. Jim could a' told me. What'll he think if he's there, and me refusin' to come? But if he was there he wouldn't a' sent Jim."</p> 
                  <p>"Why?"</p> 
                  <p>"He'd come hisself."</p> 
                   
                  <p>Abraham would have liked some other ending of her story better. The difference between him and Philly was deep-laid and thorough. He had endured life. She, with no better facilities, had, in spite of fortune, enjoyed it. Her version of the past had its greatest difference from his in the narration. But he was no more given to sighs and lamentations, than was Philly. He merely went plodding on-and she laughed by the way. She was young. He was an old man, though but forty years of age. In his youth he was as grave as now. His despondencies were not occasioned by the gloomy prospect before him; it was not advancing years, possible helplessness, and certain death, that gave the solemnity to his face-the gravity to his speech; but a natural spiritlessness which had been fostered by every circumstance and influence of his lot. That which could have made a different kind of man of him seemed never ready to perform its office. The most of people are not utterly worthless; and though they seem to be, and are rejected by the gods of this world, their Maker knows, who sees.</p> 
                  <p>You may wind the lock of a musical box for ever and ever, and get no tune. If you are not persuaded, blow the organ bellows, pull the stops, move the pedal, where is the sound all the while? beyond your reach, unless you operate in accordance, in sympathy, with the instrument's true law of action.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham's countenance, as he sat looking at Philly while she spoke, had a variety of expression, indicating<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6043-00000020"/> ting that she could not only interest, but move him. What had those tears meant? What did it mean, that he should feel so strangely the glowing description she gave of Eph?</p> 
                  <p>"What makes you live alone?" she asked, now that she was done talking of herself.</p> 
                  <p>"Who should I live with?" said Abraham, surprised.</p> 
                  <p>"Your folks."</p> 
                  <p>Abraham shook his head. He hadn't any folks, he said.</p> 
                  <p>"Dead?" asked Philly.</p> 
                  <p>No-but he never had any, he thought.</p> 
                  <p>What was his business then? Philly was curious to know that. It is surprising to think of all the questioning that goes on in the world-has it no more significance than would appear? If a man sits down beside you in the cars and fails to draw from you all personal concernments, your history, as it is called, does he not straightway take most honorable vengeance and tell you of his own?</p> 
                  <p>I knew a man who built before his house-not fit to stall a beast in-the most astonishing gateway of polished stone and iron.</p> 
                  <p>But if Philly's curiosity was not, under the circumstances, surprising, neither was it quite idle.</p> 
                  <p>When she asked him what was his business, then, without speaking, he lifted an iron rod, with a hook at the end; and showed it her.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"That's the way <emph>you</emph> keep the fire going?" commented she in perfect understanding of the sign.</p> 
                  <p>The remark called Abraham out in an unexpected direction.</p> 
                  <p>"How many nights could that fire keep you from the dance?" said he.</p> 
                  <p>"One, for sure," she answered, laughing.</p> 
                  <p>"Two?"</p> 
                  <p>"Who knows?"</p> 
                  <p>"Who pays for the lights and things at the dance?"</p> 
                  <p>"The boys."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you make an all-night job of it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not quite. Twelve's our time o' day. All the lights go out then-and we go too."</p> 
                  <p>"It's bad for you," said serious Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"What for is it bad?" asked unbelieving Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"You'd better be a bed."</p> 
                  <p>"May be I know best. I don't need so much sleep as some. I wake up at six to a minit. And there ain't a day but I'm on the ground afore anybody else."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you lay up any money?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not much." Philly answered, carelessly-it was a matter of indifference to her.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you?" she asked of him in turn.</p> 
                  <p>"No,"-he was constrained to answer-and he looked around him as if challenging the world's contradiction.</p> 
                  <p>"You oughter," she said, so gravely that the remark<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6043-00000021"/> mark puzzled Abraham. "What are you living for, then? You hain't got any folks. You don't have no fun. You work all the time. You spends nothing. What are you living for?"</p> 
                  <p>"Sure enough!" was Abraham's mental comment.</p> 
                  <p>"You oughter make lots of money. No one to take care of. Never out o' nights. It don't cost such a sight to take care of one."</p> 
                  <p>She did not more than half believe in his poverty.</p> 
                  <p>"I shouldn't wonder," said she, frankly, "if you was full of your riches." She laughed lightly saying this, as if talking of dust, or anything worthless. Was she less honest than she seemed? The old man would like to find her out.</p> 
                  <p>"I ain't worth anything," said he, "but what have you done with all your earnings?"</p> 
                  <p>"Spent 'em. ALL. A mighty sight!"</p> 
                  <p>"'Spose you're took sick again-or anything happens. Is Ephrim going to take care of you allers?"</p> 
                  <p>"Never you mind about that," said Philly, carelessly. But she was red in the face, and moved somewhat, by this question he had asked her. Never till this moment had she asked it of herself. Suddenly she seemed concerned lest he should interpret her silence in some way she would not choose to have him.</p> 
                  <p>"If I'm sick, them I've helped will help me. I ain't afraid of anything happening. Are you? What if <emph>you</emph> get sick, eh?"</p> 
                  <p>"That's what I'm feared of sometimes," said he, coughing slightly; his whole aspect changing with the suggestion.</p> 
                  <p>"Where be your friends?" asked Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"I hain't no friends."</p> 
                  <p>"When did you come to this town?"</p> 
                  <p>"Child, I've lived here allers."</p> 
                  <p>"And hain't no friends to this day!" her unassumed wonder made him haste to say:-</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, as to that-friends, yes. We call 'em so till the time comes when we want 'em. But when you want 'em, it's all up then. I know: I've tried."</p> 
                  <p>"Them ain't my kind," said Philly with spirit. "They're up and doin' when you want 'em. I oughter gone to Tabby's. But it'll be good on some of 'em. They expect me allers. And it don't come right for the rest of the girls. They'll have their share of the fun to-night. They won't have me to fight about."</p> 
                  <p>A notable ball-room belle this! Smiling over her conquests, and yet exulting in the consciousness that her absence would be the occasion of triumph to others.</p> 
                  <p>Dimly the old man, as if from afar, perceived the virtue of this character. Something of the fact she had proclaimed, he was able to perceive. He did not wonder that she should be sought more than others in the dance, and he needed not that she should offer any proof that it was so.</p> 
                  <p>It was not difficult for him to lead her to talk on this subject, and, without his will Abraham was lured<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6043-00000022"/> by her story now and then into such laughter as startled him. He laughed at her pictures as a young man laughs who hears a beauty ridicule his rival. His appreciation seemed to encourage Philly. She was satisfied with even this small audience, and talked on as if the room were filled with admiring listeners. So that when she started up, as it seemed in the midst of her story, her face glowing from the stove-heat, and said, with a flourish full of character, and full of grace too-</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you for your fire," Abraham was shocked that she should go so soon.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold on!" said he, speaking faster than he had ever spoken in his life-without an effort, he was so much in earnest-"the fire ain't out yet. Stay and see it out."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm going to keep better hours," answered she, half-laughing. "Wasn't it that you preached up, just now?"</p> 
                  <p>So Abraham said no more, but sat looking at the door which she closed and bolted behind her-looking full of wonderment.</p> 
                  <p>If Philly had thrown open the doors of his being for Abraham, she had received from him something in return, of which she was thinking when she lay down on her bed and covered herself with the blanket Ephraim bought for her. In spite of the thought he stirred, however, she quickly fell asleep. But, in the morning it was the first that recurred to her mind, "Is Ephrim going to take care of you allers?" and she could not make answer satisfactory to herself by saying, "What's that to you?"</p> 
                  <p>After she left him the old man sat looking at the cellar-door, as if he entertained some forlorn hope or expectation that she would return again. But he was really in no such expectation-he cherished no such hope. He was used to seeing joys and sorrows glide away from him; he held them, loosely in his hands, as one who has never been able to retain anything in his hold, who fully expects all things to pass beyond his reach; that whatever he has, will, in some way, vanish. This has been his experience so long that he has come, it would seem, irretrievably, to the gloomy conclusion that "Not to desire or admire .... were more than to walk all day, like the sultan of old, in a garden of spice."</p> 
                  <p>But now how strangely has this habit of mind been disturbed!</p> 
                  <p>Once in a while, years and years ago, Abraham would go to the theatre. He thought he had lost his taste for that sort of amusement. He fell into this mistake naturally-by going to the play one night when his mind was on the rack, beyond the reach of any diversion. Ever since that day he had set his face against all institutions devoted to the entertainment of the people; to anything that looked like an attempt to embellish or ornament the barren fact of life. Many people wiser than Abraham are guilty, to<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6043-00000023"/> this day of the same sad mistake. Recreation and dissipation are synonyms to their mind.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham had far from exhausted his interest in the pleasant phases of existence. This very evening seemed to return him, or introduce him to a sphere that had allurement, beguilement, fascination, sweet satisfaction. He was thrown into a gentle and very healthful state of excitement when Philly closed the door behind her; even as one feels when a pretty and agreeable actress retires behind the scenes without dispelling the illusion she has wrought; but, not as one thinks when the curtain drops before dead Adrienne, or Camille, before Rachel, immortal Queen of Tragedy, and Artist Absolute for ever.</p> 
                  <p>He wished for the reappearance, and was not satisfied without expression of his wish. Yet he made no expression of it. Long after Philly had fallen asleep he sat by the stove, till the fire had gone out, and the cellar was cold, thinking of her. Even after he had gone to bed, he lay wakeful, recalling her sayings. Not wondering at himself for being so impressed by them, but at her for having thought and spoken them.</p> 
                  <p>Her quick mind in that evening talk had overtaken and passed beyond him, had spoken of things as yet untouched by him, even in his imaginations. He began to wonder why he had been so lonely during his past life. He considered that point without its appropriate, attendant bearings, left out of mind the difficulties ties there might have been in keeping those imaginary beings, with whom he now surrounded himself, in mere bread and water, clothes and shelter. Imagination pays little heed to necessity. He was on this rare night like any other idealist. What painter, what poet is cognizant of earthly conditions, restraints, and discipline, when he cries "Let there be light," and embodies from the splendor that follows his word, the answer to his soul!</p> 
                  <p>Abraham Black-old Abraham-you have known hunger and nakedness, but the home you build and people, is not aware of such things. You are dull and stupid, but your wife is young and gay-like Philly even! As free of care as she; your boys and girls have round and rosy faces, and their blue eyes never weep. They all look like their mother .... what mother? .... what children? Go to sleep, Abraham. Are you not too old to seek a Land of Promise?</p> 
                  <p>With feelings of peculiar security and contentment he fell asleep at length. The little leathern bag that held his earthly all was hid securely under a stone that spread beneath the stove. It, that treasure, had cost him at various times uneasiness and sleeplessness-but now his sense of security was heightened-he had denied before Philly the possession of any worldly goods, but he would as soon have shared the knowledge of his fortune, and shared the fortune itself with her. It was but small-and yet too great to risk by mentioning; but now he could mention it to her, he<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6043-00000024"/> felt, and not lose his sense of security. Yes-she was to be trusted!</p> 
                  <p>When Abraham wakened, Philly's door stood open. Without a thought of what he did, he acted on his impulse in that first moment of wakefulness, and called out "Philly." Glad was he when there came no answer to the call; when, after long and breathless listening, he became convinced that there would be none.</p> 
                  <p>He went out to his day-labor earlier than usual that morning-he walked at a brisk pace. And he thought, as he went, that he might as well have asked her about the locality of the crossings she swept. But he still hoped that he might obtain a glimpse of her. So he hurried on as though it were a real matter of importance that he should. As if the barrels and sewers could not be delayed!</p> 
                  <p>But he did not find her, and after an hour's vain rambling here and there, he began to feel the fatigue and nonsense of his search.</p> 
                  <p>After that he kept steadily at work all day. Yes, with the energy of a man at least ten years younger than the Abraham of yesterday; and he went home at an earlier hour than usual, kindled his fire nimbly, spread his supper on the corner of the box end, which he used for his table, and having done this, he sat down to wait. Wait for what?</p> 
                  <p>There were two herrings instead of one upon the box-a whole loaf instead of half a one!</p> 
                   
                  <p>What was the matter of the old man? Philly did not come. He went often to the cellar-door and looked out into the street-he smoked his pipe. He whistled part of an old tune he used to know-he planted his foot on the stone under his stove-and began to feel the benefit of riches. It was a new thing for him to be waiting for any one; to be expecting any one with desire for the arrival.</p> 
                  <p>After awhile it began to be tedious and fatiguing-all this waiting-the fire burned poorly-Abraham's high glee cooled down to impatience, and was chilled from that into sadness-and he seemed to be saying to himself: "Of course-why did you look for anything different?"</p> 
                  <p>At last he ate his supper: the one herring, the half loaf. Then he looked out again, and for the last time, into the dark street, up to the starry sky-returned, shut the stove-door, and threw himself upon his bed. He would rest till she came, but not sleep. When she came it would be only an instant's work to revive the quenched fire-she could sit down then, and eat her supper. Something kept her. What was it? He did not like to think it was the dance.</p>

                  <head type="sub">GROWING YOUNG.</head> 
                  <p>IN spite of the sleep into which he fell, the gods were kind to Abraham; for he wakened as Philly made her descent into the cellar.</p> 
                  <p>He heard her descend the steps; heard her speak to her companion; heard her close the heavy door, carefully, as if she remembered, and would not disturb, him. And then he saw her go to the stove and sit down beside it.</p> 
                  <p>He felt easy in his mind after that. He was content not to speak to Philly. She was safe within doors, and somehow her safety was the point about which he had been so much disturbed, as if he were responsible for it. She arose at length. He saw as well as heard her. He saw her go across the room, and that did not move him to speak-he was satisfied that she was there. But, when she had reached the door of her-kennel, I had almost said, for the word seems most applicable to that dark den-when she had reached that door, she halted, wheeled about, looked toward Abraham's bed, and went toward it. There she stood without speaking, laboring under some doubt or hesitation which, though unknown to him, was more painful to the old fellow even than to her, for <emph>he</emph> could not keep silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Have you had your supper?" said he. "There's some on the box yonder. I left it for you. I thought you'd come back long ago."</p> 
                  <p>"I had to go to Tabby's party," said Philly. What was this change in her voice that struck no less upon the heart than on the ear of Abraham? as if some excitement or some trouble had swept past her, or through her, and shaken her soul. "I hope you didn't wait for me," she said.</p> 
                  <p>"I did though," answered Abraham quickly, quite eager to impress the fact on her mind, since she seemed desirous to know it.</p> 
                  <p>"I couldn't help it. I'm sorry. It was kind to wait, Abraham. I'll be along another time."</p> 
                  <p>"Will you?" said Abraham; and then as if fearful that he had expressed too much, "I guess not."</p> 
                  <p>"But I will. I'm so tired. And they got into a quarrel that makes me think I'll not be going again. It's not the fun I like, to run a chance of having my head split open to a dance."</p> 
                  <p>"Fun!" exclaimed Abraham; if he could have been contemptuous there would have been contempt in that single exclamation. "What was the fight for?"</p> 
                  <p>"About one of the girls," said Philly, her voice acquiring something of its ordinary free speech. She was not unwilling to talk about what had happened.</p> 
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6043-00000026"/> 
                  <p>"Yourself, I'll bet," said Abraham. "What?" he inquired, for she was silent.</p> 
                  <p>"You was the girl. What d'ye go for? You said last night to keep yourself warm. But didn't you like the stove? And didn't you hear me say there'd be a fire here every night, which you're as welcome to as you're welcome to the cold outside!"</p> 
                  <p>"Don't scold," said Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Scold, 'tain't scolding-it's talking to you."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't talk."</p> 
                  <p>"What did you tell me for?" Could this roused speaker be Abraham Black! "You might as well talk to a post if you don't want an opinion. Maybe I ain't as wise as some. There's your Ephrim-why didn't you tell him 'stead of me?" Then gently he added, "You'll kill yourself keeping such hours, Philly; you had better go to bed."</p> 
                  <p>"What if I should kill myself, Abraham?"</p> 
                  <p>"What if you should? Girl-Philly-what are you talking about? What if you should? Enough, I'd think."</p> 
                  <p>"But what, Abraham? What?"</p> 
                  <p>"Haven't you got any friends?"</p> 
                  <p>"I guess not," said she despondingly. Very likely for the sake of hearing the supposition disputed.</p> 
                  <p>"You talked to another tune last night. What do you go to Tabby's for? Isn't it to oblige your friends? That's what you said."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-yes-it's so."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"If it wa'n't," said he in a lower voice, but Philly distinctly heard him, "you might a better stayed here, to oblige a friend."</p> 
                  <p>"That's so," responded Philly heartily. "Good night, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"But here. Eat your bread and herring first. On the box yonder. Take it with you, do."</p> 
                  <p>"I've had enough," said Philly. "Keep it for your breakfast. Good night."</p> 
                  <p>"Tell me first what they quarrelled for."</p> 
                  <p>"It would take me all night, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"Was't you then?" he yet demanded. But Philly was gone.</p> 
                  <p>It was long before Abraham fell asleep again. Wakeful he lay. His imagination, that newborn faculty within him, was roused by this conversation to thinking of her appearing and disappearing, and to wondering whether she had really no other, no last, no satisfying word to say, that would set his mind at rest. At last from sheer exhaustion he fell asleep-charging himself over and over again to waken before she went out in the morning. He must learn what the quarrel was about-he wanted to see Philly's face by daylight, which he had not yet done, that he might discover what it was that haunted him. Poor old fellow! it was nothing more than a cheerful temper and the elastic voice belonging to it.</p> 
                  <p>There he was, then, early in the morning, by daybreak, sitting by the stove, not quite the <choice>
                        <sic>grimest</sic>
                        <corr>grimmest</corr>
                     </choice>
                     <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6043-00000027"/> shadow there. He had not kindled any fire, but sat smoking, when she came out from that-kennel.</p> 
                  <p>She had her broom in her hand as she came, and she moved cautiously, as if fearful of waking him. She was ready for the street-her straw bonnet resting on the crown of her head, was fastened under her chin by a string and a pin-her head was almost entirely exposed, and looked larger and heavier than it really was, contrasted with the bit of bonnet she wore. The black locks were pushed straight back from her forehead, leaving the face to tell its own story. It was a good face, a perfect oval, of dark, clear complexion-brows slightly arched-a fine forehead-and pleasant brown eyes. The nose and mouth were not small and delicate, but neither was there a coarse line or curve to be detected in them. She stood erect and strong, looking honestly at the world, and expressing wholly a character such as the world can rarely impose upon. She did not look eager and cunning, as children do who have grown up on the pavement, and learned to look at life as a grab game in which cunning is surest to prevail. She looked experienced; and her eye told that she would be swift and resolute, and that she was accustomed to weigh, judge, and pass sentence on all things that came within her observation.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham could but just discern her in the poor light, could only see her person, as he did her character, in outline. She had not yet observed him. But as she came forward he arrested her steps by a sweep of the arm, and rising at the same time, he said, "Wait a minit."</p> 
                  <p>Philly stopped at the sound of his voice-she hesitated-perhaps he needed her. So she said, without advancing a step nearer him, "What'll you have, there?"</p> 
                  <p>"Here's your breakfast waiting," said he, pointing to the bread and fish.</p> 
                  <p>Philly thanked him kindly, but she did not want the bread and fish. She did not eat so early-she earned her breakfast before she ate it, she said.</p> 
                  <p>While she was saying this, Abraham arose. He advanced toward her. It was still almost quite dark in the room, but light enough for him, whose eyes were accustomed to peering through such thick shadows, to perceive that which Philly had endeavored to hide from him.</p> 
                  <p>"What's this? What's happened?" he exclaimed, standing before her.</p> 
                  <p>It was easier for Philly to answer than to go off silent.</p> 
                  <p>"I was in the way, and got a fling," she explained-then she began to move toward the door, averting her face from him as she went, that he might see no more of the black eye than that glimpse he had already obtained.</p> 
                  <p>Seeing her purpose brought Abraham up to the point of resistance again. With an authority that had<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6043-00000028"/> but rarely in his life found an expression, he said, laying his hand on her arm-but it was very gently-</p> 
                  <p>"You're going into the street. You're going to be seen by everybody. I want to see first."</p> 
                  <p>"Nobody sees anything in the street," said she. "Let me go-quick. I'll be late on the ground, and that's worst of all."</p> 
                  <p>She spoke in an excited, distressed sort of way, that Abraham seemed to set himself against with a great deal more than the strength of his own nature, though he said kindly:-</p> 
                  <p>"I'll give you leave in a minit, if you will be so foolish. Tell me, first, if you feel that ere bruise."</p> 
                  <p>"It aches some," admitted Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"It'll ache worse then. Sit down, and I'll tell you what to do. Sit down."</p> 
                  <p>Philly obeyed. It was as new to hear any one speaking to her in that manner, as it was for Abraham so to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"You go out and get a little cold," he continued, "and may be you'll come off as I did-with the sight of one eye instead of two. How did you get that hurt?"</p> 
                  <p>"Trying to stop a fight," answered Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor pay for your trouble. That come of going to the dance."</p> 
                  <p>"It come of it," admitted Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, now, will you hear me this time?"</p> 
                  <p>"Say on."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Stay in the house and keep that eye to yourself, till it gets back its old looks. To-day, any way. I'll take care of you. There's the wood. Make a fire, and fix the things in the room, if you get tired of sitting still. But don't you go out. This sharp wind would cut that eye like a knife. I know. It was the way with me-but I'd no one to say, 'Stay in and take care of yourself."'</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Philly, with sudden and entire relenting, "I'll stay." It was almost as though she were granting a favor. Abraham felt the promise to be the token of the most signal triumph of his life. But he was magnanimous in his victory, and went off with few words after she had given her promise. He did not even commend the bread and fish again to her attention; and he said not a word about his intention of a return at noon.</p> 
                  <p>He went out, but in a moment, as it seemed to Philly, he was back again; he came with a piece of brown paper soaked in water. This he bound around her eye and forehead, speaking but a word or two as he did so, and then he was fairly off.</p> 
                  <p>Ten years younger to-day than yesterday-twenty years swept clean from his shoulders and his face. Blessed old Abraham! how long you've been in learning that it is easier to grow young than old.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE GREAT MAN OF THE ALLEY.</head> 
                  <p>PHILLY had a long day before her. For the first time since the fever, she sat down with the prospect of daylight and repose before her.</p> 
                  <p>In that dismal cellar she caught the sounds of the waking city. She knew that was going on in the streets. How the people were bestirring themselves. How the World was waking up. How the trades and the professions began to walk about in the forms of men and women. How the newsboys began to run and cry. How the carts began to rattle, and the old men like Abraham crawled forth from attic and basement, and began to poke about. She followed herself to the crossings she frequented. She saw herself in the midst of the ever-growing, strengthening tide of life. She sat down at the stall of an old woman, and gave the poor body an afternoon of sleep as she had never failed to do for some fellow-mortal, since the death of little Jess. She made more money in imagination, as she always did in fact, in those few hours' sale, than the woman could do in a week; the world is so much more generous to beauty, strength, and health, than to its weary, weak, and desolate. If no one missed her in the street, tired and longing eyes would wait for her by that apple-stand-and how could the old woman manage with her chair, and basket, and herself, when night should come?</p> 
                  <p>Why, when she had in imagination and memory gone over the occupation of the day, did Philly halt upon the threshold of the evening-standing in hesitancy as it were upon the steps of her cellar, and looking off toward Tabby's? Fresh as she was in her unexhausted strength and spirits as she sat there by the stove, why did she not spring on with her impulse to the dance? Had this ill-fated blow blinded her sense to the amusement she was wont to find there? No-but the kind voice of Abraham was counselling her to restrain her steps from Tabby's. And his voice had a most strange attraction for her ear.</p> 
                  <p>Not for any shame occasioned by the disfigurement of her face, nor from any fear of the effects of an exposure, in spite of Abraham's lost eye, had she consented to remain in the lonesome cellar that day. He had asked her to remain-and it was so rare a thing to hear anything like anxiety expressed in her behalf, so pleasant a thing, free and courageous though she was, to feel that any hand with the impulse of a protector was raised in her behalf, that it pleased her to obey.</p> 
                  <p>But the day was likely to go heavily. When she<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6043-00000030"/> had brushed the ashes from the stove-hearth with her broom, and swept the floor, and kindled a fire, and made up Abraham's bed, and eaten the long-neglected herring and the half loaf, there was nothing for her to do but to sit down and think. Dull work was that for her. It could not keep her awake while she endeavored to pursue it-and so she slept.</p> 
                  <p>Waking, she found that the day had brightened greatly in its growth; through the dingy cellar-windows streamed rays that were almost sunny.</p> 
                  <p>To take a glimpse of out-door life, Philly arose and went toward the door. Just there, as her hand lifted to the latch, her attention was attracted by what she thought at first might be the fragments of Abraham's pipe, but as she stooped to the ground, she saw her mistake. It was a medallion in plaster, Thorwalsden's Morning, broken into fifty pieces.</p> 
                  <p>Philly gathered up these pieces with pleased curiosity, and took them to the window, and thence to the box by the stove, where she sat down to arrange them. The design was as unintelligible to her eyes as a relic of the "lost arts," exhumed from Antiquity, might be to eyes profane. She could make nothing perfect or entire from the fragments, but an image of beauty had started up from the disjointed, imperfect form, and lured her on, so that the time went by unheeded, until noon, when Abraham returned.</p> 
                  <p>He smiled when he saw Philly there; all the morning his convictions had been strengthening that she would really pay no heed to his wish, though she had given her promise.</p> 
                  <p>"This is good," he said, smiling again with a clearer brow, when he felt the trifle of warmth imparted to the atmosphere of the cellar by the fire she had kindled; and he rubbed his hands with all the satisfaction of many a man who stands up before his coal-grate, and looks his wonderment upon some rare work of art that has found its way into his drawing-room. As he stooped down by the box to look at the bits of plaster Philly had been arranging, with sudden dexterity he whisked from a paper the dinner he had brought home, and ranged the provisions with a grave laugh round the medallion. He was ready now to be amused by any device that Philly could invent. He was completely in her hands.</p> 
                  <p>He could not explain the medallion to her when she asked him to explain it. He said that it was pretty; but it had none of the attractions for his eyes that it had for hers. Because it interested her it interested him; but the designer's ideal beauty had no such charm to Abraham as had Philly's living presence. What were expression, effect, and symbolic excellence, to him? Philly, in her rags, with her genial nature bursting through the frost of all surrounding influences, far too large and strong for her threadbare circumstances, was great to him, Thorwalsden nothing. So while Philly bent over the box, and arranged and re-arranged the fragments, wearing<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6043-00000031"/> still, where he had placed it, the bandage of brown paper, to his infinite satisfaction, he sat and observed her.</p> 
                  <p>He came home intending to remain within if the afternoon proved, as it threatened to be, stormy, and now he had already forgotten that he had made the going out to depend upon the weather. If he might take his serene thoughts for a barometer there was no indication of a storm from east to west, from the rising of his sun to its going down. Every power in the world was an abstraction, except Philly sitting there-Philly sharing his bread. She did it with the air of one who does a service; he watched her with the look of a man on whom a service is conferred. It pleased him so much that she would share the bread for which he had toiled.</p> 
                  <p>They were still sitting there, when suddenly, as if by magic, the cellar-door was opened and closed, and a young man stood within the room. He came forward briskly, speaking in the loud rapid voice of one who has no time to spare:-</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, here you be! Your eye done up! What's the matter? What have you been doing?"</p> 
                  <p>He had an authoritative way of speaking which made Abraham's spirit rise up, belligerent. But you never could have suspected it of the old fellow as he sat there so meek-looking, like a mummy, when contrasted with the large-framed, stout-voiced, full-blooded Jehu, before him.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Philly did not keep Ephraim waiting for an answer.</p> 
                  <p>"Last night, you know," said she; she said it in a way that arrested the attention of Abraham. This was not the manner of her speech to him. But he could not define the difference. It was in this: she felt herself to be stronger, more alive than Abraham -more awake to the world, and up to it, as you might say. He might have been her younger brother, or her son, or her servant, from the way she spoke to him. She meant by it no more than kindliness; he received it as not less than that. But when now she spoke to Ephraim, she was addressing her superior perhaps, at the very least, her equal. Such a mighty man of valor-such a giant in height and strength was he.</p> 
                  <p>"What!" he exclaimed and the cellar rang with the sound, "was it you that stood 'twixt Tom and me? Keep out of the way next time. I heerd you wasn't out to-day; is that the reason?"</p> 
                  <p>"This old gentleman thought I'd best stay in, and so I did."</p> 
                  <p>For the first time, apparently, Ephraim observed that Philly was not alone. And he looked at the old man with an offensive questioning that Philly understood better than Abraham, and lost no time in resenting.</p> 
                  <p>"The old gentleman has took the room," said she. "He lives here."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" remarked Ephraim stiffly; and then he condescended<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6043-00000032"/> descended to ask what had become of the old woman: which question Philly could not answer.</p> 
                  <p>There was no need of consulting the oracle in reference to this man. Every word and look betrayed him. He would not sit down when Philly rose and offered him her seat-he would stand, and stand there.</p> 
                  <p>"But sit down," said he to her. And to Abraham's astonishment, Philly complied.</p> 
                  <p>"My advice to you is not to go out till that there bruise is better. You're a beauty now for sure!" he continued, and he laughed.</p> 
                  <p>There was something so unfeeling in this laugh and jest-so different from Abraham's way-that Philly felt the difference, and retorted indignantly:-</p> 
                  <p>"I shouldn't have had it in my own fight. I never got hurt yet in a quarrel of my own. It was to stop you when I might as well have tried to stop a mad dog."</p> 
                  <p>The young man laughed at her speech-good-humoredly it seemed-but there was nothing pleasant in his laugh; when he stopped there was no evidence of merriment on his face, it was darker and more threatening than before.</p> 
                  <p>"There'll be no dance to-night if you can't come," said he. "Shall it be to-morrow, then?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know as ever," answered Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Phil la lu lu! That's the time of day! I'll make you sing a better tune then. Here-I made this clean, this morning. I want to get rid of it. Take care of it for me. You know what that means. Get a new dress with it, you need one." On the great palm he extended toward her, lay a silver dollar.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't want it," said she; and there was no desire for it in the eye that glanced from the money to him.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, ho! why not?" asked Ephraim offended, and drawing himself up now as if confronting an antagonist. And then he looked perplexed from her to Abraham. "It's a new card this. Will it take a trick, ma'am?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't need the money," said Philly, apparently unmoved by his last words, speaking quite firmly, as if her purpose were not to be changed. The old man, looking at her, only admired her courage, and never thought of interference. He was not quick and skilful in hearing, or in sight; and besides he would not be likely to speak in such a presence, for evidently he was "a worm and no man" before Ephraim, and this fact he substantially appreciated, though the fact did not take a humiliating expression to his consciousness.</p> 
                  <p>"You're kind to offer it, Ephrim," said Philly rapidly, for it seemed quite likely now that Ephraim would go off without speaking again-he had put the money in his pocket, and his face darkened. "But I owe you more now than I shall ever pay, I'm feared. This old gentleman who you see, took the<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6043-00000033"/> place of the woman, and he lets me sit by the stove here, and I've had my dinner, Eph. I don't want nothing. If I did, you're the man I'd go to. There's nobody ever been so kind to me as you was. I don't forget. If I ever need the money, I'll let you know it, sure."</p> 
                  <p>Her last words produced an evident effect.</p> 
                  <p>"Be sure you do, Philly," said he, more kindly than it seemed possible for him to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"I will."</p> 
                  <p>"Good day, then;" and so he turned, and left her. At the door he bowed to the old man-and Abraham was brought to his feet by the courtesy. He even started forward after Eph, as if he would say or do something in acknowledgment, but the giant disappeared.</p> 
                  <p>After he had gone, Philly, without a word, sat down the medallion again. She seemed to forget Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>He said something to her about their visiter, but she seemed not to hear him-made no reply; did not even look up. That was sufficient to silence him; he showed no persistance; he never did on any occasion of rebuff, intentional or otherwise; he was merely borne along on the resistless tide like a leaf. So he sat now and wondered in silence. Wondered at the young Goliath-wondered at the change his appearing had produced in Philly.</p> 
                  <p>He was so absorbed in this wonderment that he did not see that Philly's eyes were on him. How she looked up quickly once, and then again, and again, until she quite forgot the medallion, and said at length:-</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim is allers in a hurry. It's short and sweet with him."</p> 
                  <p>"Short and sour I'd think," answered Abraham speaking out his mind with perfect freedom. His words troubled Philly. She was eager to convince him that he had made a mistake here.</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim has so much to do he can't stand talking all day about a thing. When he speaks out his mind you know what he means. A kinder fellow to me never lived. He's short and quick when he has anything to say. And that's a comfort sometimes. It didn't sound ugly to you, what he said?" This was actually an inquiry made for satisfaction. For a doubt, or apprehension, or fear of some sort, some new kind, was in Philly's brain.</p> 
                  <p>"Well," hesitated Abraham, "maybe not what you'd call ugly, but deuced like it."</p> 
                  <p>The hesitation with which Abraham spoke this, assured Philly that her own doubt or apprehension was groundless; but the fact that in spite of the hesitation he did yet pass such judgment, ought rather to have increased her distrust.</p> 
                  <p>"He ain't ugly though," she made haste to say. "'Tis his way."</p> 
                  <p>"You oughter teach him better," modestly suggested<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6043-00000034"/> ed the old man. Philly looked at him in silence. He thought he understood her glance, and here he was not mistaken.</p> 
                  <p>"You could," said he, his head settling forward in earnestness of speech.</p> 
                  <p>Philly laughed to hear him, and the cloud over her spirits seemed to roll away with that outbreak. Her face brightened.</p> 
                  <p>"If anybody could," said she. "But it's best to let well enough alone. You ought to see him when he's up. 'Get out o' the way, Daniel Tucker!"' With this explosion into song the last shadow of the cloud vanished. Philly was herself again.</p> 
                  <p>"He has it all his own way," said she. "But who's like him for a leader?" She had now the confident bearing and tone of one who knows that the argument is all his own. "You'd see the difference when he was away. Things goes to suit themselves then. But let him show his shadow in the room! You'd know why we call him the governor. He makes money enough to buy us all up. He's going to be a rich man, Ephrim is. He'll roll around in his carriage one of the days, he says. I think he might. He can do anything. He is a reader. Sometimes when he feels right, he will tell me what he reads. He can explain anything. Don't you see what eyes he's got?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I see 'em," said the old man in an under tone. Evidently he had not been at all attracted by the sight. Eph was precisely the man, of all men, in whose presence Abraham would be a non-entity.</p> 
                  <p>That the young man was all that Philly asserted, he believed, yet, for his brain had acquired an unusual activity within the few past hours, he could not easily reconcile her first account of "Ephrim" with her behavior toward him when he was actually there, and he asked her by-and-by:-</p> 
                  <p>"Are you afeard of that there young man?"</p> 
                  <p>"Afeard!" exclaimed Philly, it seemed as if in amazement and disdain. But there she stopped. Her face reddened. And it was actually doubt as to whether there were truth in her answer that made her hesitate in saying:-</p> 
                  <p>"No; what made you ask?"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, nothing," and with that Abraham was silent. But she was not content with the reply, and she asked him again presently, why he should suppose that she feared Ephraim.</p> 
                  <p>"You looked different when he come," said he quietly.</p> 
                  <p>"How different?" demanded she.</p> 
                  <p>"Just different-not the same. I don't know how," answered he.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm not afeard," said she deliberately. "There's no man living I'm afeard of. I takes care of myself." And here the sense of her independence seemed to inspire her with indignation that it should be questioned. "I'm not beholden to anybody<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6043-00000035"/> body. I don't want no favors, I don't want your fire, nor bread, nor nothing. Afeard of Ephrim! Do I look as if I'd be afeard!" She opened the stove door as she spoke, and swept the remainder of the dinner, and the fragments of the medallion into the flame, with such a look as made the old man start.</p> 
                  <p>And there was his pipe about to share in the general ruin. Abraham saw, and sprang toward it, but too late-it fell, not into the flame, but to the earthy floor, and there lay broken in a hundred pieces.</p> 
                  <p>It needed just that turn to the catastrophe to bring Philly soberly to herself. Had the pipe gone the way of the medallion, had its ruin been hid from her eyes, she would have closed the stove-door, and stood up still angry, and defiant. But to see the old man's treasure lying on the floor, shattered, to see his consternation, and notice the way in which he controlled himself, that brought her to her senses.</p> 
                  <p>Before he could speak she had gathered up the clay fragments and exhibiting them as they lay on her hand, she said quietly, "I'll get you another."</p> 
                  <p>She need not have said that-need not have spoken so gently. Had she only smiled that smile on him it had been sufficient. Peace with him was easy to obtain. The terms were hers to make.</p> 
                  <p>It was easy for him to say that the pipe ought to have been thrown away long ago. That it was quite burnt out; that she need not trouble herself about anything so worthless. It was just as natural for her that she should insist on replacing it. That she should compel Abraham, to tell her the price of his pipe, and to receive from her the trifle needful for that purpose.</p> 
                  <p>So now they sat and talked. They had made a progress since the morning. Philly's sprightliness seemed evoked for the special consolation of Abraham that afternoon. For his benefit at least; for, as the storm increased and the gloom, her voice became more and more cheerful, her talk more lively. She made old Abraham laugh till the tears rolled down his cheeks, and he forgot the outbreak he had witnessed. In the dismal twilight of the cellar all that rainy afternoon, they chattered like two birds in one tree-like other agreeable bodies, satisfied with their company.</p> 
                  <p>Well-dressed people, in handsome drawing-rooms, through whose windows of plate-glass came the dull light of the dull afternoon, did not amuse themselves more innocently, or enjoy the time more thoroughly than they.</p> 
                  <p>But do not envy them, young lady or old gentleman. They may live in the street, but are not therefore children of the sun. They are as far perhaps, but no farther, above the chances of their lot, than any soul may be. They both are longing; and their desire, it may be, is as far from realization as yours. They walk forward to the future, it may be, with as much expectance of some good unproved to them as<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6043-00000036"/> yet, as you, and their desire may be as vague and uncertain, so that it may be they shall always retain the privilege of being unsatisfied; chasers of illusions without real shape, or Christian name. But-I think not. From Philly's countenance I gather the good hope. She does not look as if unleavened bread and bitter herbs had been her sustenance; nor as if she never would nor could overtake the far-off First Division, in the grand march of life.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE IMAGE-BOY.</head> 
                  <p>"THERE'S no work to be done this day," said Abraham the next morning as he stood by the open door, bailing from the floor, at the foot of the steps, the water which had collected in a pool there over night. He spoke to Philly who was coming from her room just then, and she stood, as she did yesterday when he arrested her steps, with her broom in her hand.</p> 
                  <p>"I must go out though," she said, looking up to the flooded street, and tempestuous sky.</p> 
                  <p>"How much would you be like to earn?" asked Abraham Black, after a momentary pause, during which he dipped the water in a sort of desperate fury.</p> 
                  <p>"It isn't for the earning," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"Where, then?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'm tired of staying in." But she was really already wavering in her purpose. A little entreaty and she would probably remain very contentedly within.</p> 
                  <p>"Go out and get rid of your eye then," said Abraham drawing himself up, desisting from his labor-<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6043-00000037"/> "Go out," and he actually made the counsel more impressive by pointing with his hand upward to the street.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you sure?" asked Philly, taking a step backward not forward, surrendering to him in fact before she acknowledged it.</p> 
                  <p>"No," said he, with seeming indifference, "I ain't sure of nothing," and he went on bailing up the water.</p> 
                  <p>"Let me do that," said Philly, and dropping her broom she took the battered tin basin from his hand, and proceeded with the work in which he had been engaged.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham now stood by in silence, watching her.</p> 
                  <p>"You're good at that," he remarked, when she gave him back the basin-the work done.</p> 
                  <p>"I can do some things," said Philly, with a certain air of complacence, which was not so much vanity as self-exposition, even self-justification.</p> 
                  <p>"But you can't take up with advice?"</p> 
                  <p>"You'll see," answered Philly instantly, and she threw her broom across the cellar; and, straightening herself up, she asked, "What'll I do next?"</p> 
                  <p>"Stay in till the storm is over," said Abraham, more astonished at her compliance with his word, than she; for his gray hair, and wrinkles, and seeming in-difference during the past moments, had produced a very natural effect upon the girl.</p> 
                  <p>"I can do that easy enough," said Philly; "but what I live by, is work."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Just so," said Mr. Black; "what's one day more or less, in or out? You ain't going to starve. Take care of your eye while you've got it. If you went without your dinner 'twouldn't kill you."</p> 
                  <p>"No more it wouldn't," coincided Philly, pleased indeed with his persuasion; and she returned into the cellar.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham left her there to go out to his work.</p> 
                  <p>In the course of the long morning Philly began thinking again of the medallion, and when the sun, to the surprise of the whole city, came out, it lured her forth, as it did a thousand people.</p> 
                  <p>At the same moment that she went out and stood on the upper step, close upon the sidewalk, a youth came down the alley to the stair near by, with a board of plaster images balanced on his head. Her eyes followed him till he had disappeared, and then her steps also followed. She went up the stair faster than he, so that when he threw open the door of the attic he occupied, Philly darted in before he could close it again. Just within the door, leaning against the wall, she stood; and he did not see her till he had removed the board from his head, and placed it on the floor.</p> 
                  <p>Without pausing to look at, or speak to him, or even to glance around the room-direct here, as always, in her movements, pressing on to the point in view-Philly went up to the board, knelt down upon one knee, and commenced examining its contents.</p> 
                  <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6043-00000038"/> 
                  <p>"Eh!" said the bearer in surprise. "Where did you come from?"</p> 
                  <p>"Below," replied Philly, not looking at him.</p> 
                  <p>"Eh! so I'd think," responded the youth with a smile and a shrug, while he busied himself clearing his table.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you want to buy them?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you drop anything yesterday?" said Philly, not replying, but looking up, and for the first time, at the young man's face, for she had just discovered upon his board a medallion, counterpart of that she tried to decipher in the cellar yesterday.</p> 
                  <p>Now and then how beautiful a vision breaks upon our eyes: your eyes and mine I mean. This boy was beautiful as Mario in the Puritani; or, as Raphael in the Hemicycle-and there Raphael is angelic.</p> 
                  <p>What a face it was! and how it flashed on Philly's eyes. But she was not fully equal to and ready for the revelation. So she turned after a momentary glance to the board, and repeated her question: yes, certainly, in a milder voice, and that doubtless meant something.</p> 
                  <p>How did he look? I might tell what Philly saw. A fair, fair face, without a wrinkle, or a blemish; long, brown hair, that fell loosely about it, so shining and so soft that she wondered at the growth. He wore it parted on the middle of his forehead, and his blue, calm eyes, looked out from beneath the brow with a most soothing influence. He was not great nor grand, but he was gracious and lovely. He did not suggest strength or majesty or power, either physical or mental-but childhood and peace and happiness, though his face may have been ordinarily too serious to suggest perfect freedom from all anxiety and care.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you mean a medallion?" asked he with a foreign accent; and perceiving her perplexity he took one from the table and held it before her eyes: "Like this?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," she said in recognition, her face aglow with pleasure; but she did not take the medallion in her hands. "It rolled under our door. It was broke up, but I put it together-a'most as good. What is it?"</p> 
                  <p>In his best way the youth explained the design to her. Philly listened with intelligence, her eyes fixed on the medallion; but, as he went on speaking, they lifted, range by range, from the floor to his face, taking in all that lay between, from the bed rolled up under the table, to the table itself, with its tools, and plaster, and images in different stages of formation, and, last of all, her eyes fixed on his handsome face.</p> 
                  <p>"What did he call his trade?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>He told her that he was a modeller and moulder, and she nodded as if she understood what he meant by that, but she had really only a remote idea.</p> 
                  <p>"Did he have good luck," she asked him, "selling his wares?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," he said, but he said it slowly, almost as one<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6043-00000039"/> who hopes for, rather than as one who is flushed with actual success.</p> 
                  <p>Philly was not surprised to hear him; she only heard the "Yes," she felt certain that people must like such things. "But what did they do with them" -she wanted to know-"were they for anything but to look at?"</p> 
                  <p>"For nothing in the world but to look at," he told her. "To hang on walls, or stand on the shelf, and make the rooms look beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>Philly understood his accent, and his gestures. She bowed her head in token that she did, and thought how a room must look thus decorated. But her fancy was about as far from fact as fancy usually is. No farther. Most likely she would never see a room adorned after her fancy's fashion.</p> 
                  <p>"Now," said the youth, "you ask me so many questions-how do <emph>you</emph> live?"</p> 
                  <p>"I sweep," she answered, with real, though not evident reluctance. For the first time in her life she would have chosen to conceal the fact.</p> 
                  <p>"Where do you live?" he continued.</p> 
                  <p>"Below, I told you."</p> 
                  <p>"Where's that?"</p> 
                  <p>"In the cellar of this here building," she said in a louder voice, looking straight in his face, not as though she would make the best of the truth, but as if she felt the worst of it, and was going to defy the world on that account.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Do you want one of these to put on your wall?"</p> 
                  <p>If he had offered her Venus de Medici, Philly could not have felt more astonishment. Did she express that astonishment? Not she; but merely replied:-</p> 
                  <p>"I will buy one, of you, some day."</p> 
                  <p>The youth said, "Well. But here's one I can not use, and I do not want it lying around here. It is in the way. It broke when I was trying to fix the wire in; but you see the figures are perfect. I can not sell it to anybody. Take it, and keep it if you please." And he put it into her hands. But she held the medallion in a sort of wonder and indecision, that made clear manifestation of itself. He perceived it, and said carelessly, as if he were a prince who had just given away a province: "It often happens I can make such a present, if I can only find any one to take it. Such things lumber up my room. They're in the way when I move."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll keep it," said Philly. And then, after a thoughtful silence, "I must go. I hope you won't move yet."</p> 
                  <p>"Not this quarter any way," said the boy, taking her friendly expression with entire good nature. "Come up again," he added; "maybe I'll have something new."</p> 
                  <p>By this time he had on his apron, his tools were in his hands, his arms bared to his elbows, and his countenance yet more composed in that beautiful seriousnes<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6043-00000040"/> ousness which seemed if not its most natural, its habitual, as also its most holy expression.</p> 
                  <p>But Philly did not go, though these civil parting words had now been exchanged. She stood by the door she had opened, moving it gently to and fro, and looking at the youth. She had learned that art of taking an observation in the streets, and acted on her impulse now quite unconsciously. The youth may or may not have been accustomed to such a survey-he bore it with perfect composure. Did not ask her why she lingered, either by word or look. He was already thinking of weightier matters: of his work, in which he was now busied-of to-morrow, hoping that it would prove fair, that he might try his fortune in the streets in earnest. Calculating on his profits, and cautious, meanwhile, in the execution of his work. Philly was dismissed from his thoughts. She was only a street beggar-or what amounted to the same thing-yet, she seemed to appreciate his work; this thought flashed upon him as he chanced to direct his glance toward her. The thought made him look at her again, and with interest, and kindliness. The gentle consideration, the complacent appreciation of others makes us so amiable toward them in turn!</p> 
                  <p>"How did you happen to come up?" inquired he.</p> 
                  <p>She told him again that she had labored to patch together the fragments of the medallion; and that when she saw him with the board on his head, she felt sure he was the man that made it. And then she asked him if he liked his work. She needed no other answer than she had by glancing at his face.</p> 
                  <p>Would he work then at it always? At that he shook his head. He could not tell. It all depended on his luck.</p> 
                  <p>But there was something more than he expressed, thought Philly. This was the truth: it came from him in a sudden burst of confidence, or impulse of communicativeness; first, in a still milder, gentler expression of countenance, and then in words.</p> 
                  <p>"A great deal depends on luck. When I'm certain of it, then my mother and sister are coming. We shall all be together again. I ought to succeed. I can do anything in my line," said he proudly.</p> 
                  <p>He returned then to his work. He had not to his own mind spoken foolishly. He need not disturb himself in any after thought at the exposure of his holiest hopes, even in such a hearing, in the midst of his uncertainties. Patient and hopeful he went on with his work.</p> 
                  <p>Without a word of comment, on what he had told her, Philly passed through the doorway she had kept open for herself during the last five minutes. Closing the door behind her softly, she went down to the cellar, with the medallion. But that was far from being the most prized result of the visit.</p> 
                  <p>It was, above all things, to have seen that face, and to have heard that voice. To know about that work; to hear the young man speak of his mother and his<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6043-00000041"/> sister; and to know how a loving man could look when speaking of them. Never before had she heard or seen those words so taken on the lips of man. It was a revelation.</p> 
                  <p>At the foot of the first landing she paused. She heard him singing. How distinctly, as she listened, she could see him standing by his table, so erect, strong, though slightly built-and his face with a smile on it, yet so grave-working for his mother and his sister. It was a thought more beautiful than that on the medallion-but she held that not loosely as she went her way.</p> 
                  <p>The young man resumed his work as if nothing had happened. While he sang at his work, his thoughts tool a wide circuit-a circuit that may have enclosed the girl who was but now in the room, but not as a distinct object of immediate consciousness. No doubt she did influence him in the labors of that day. Since it is commonly true that contact with those in worse condition than ourselves does not hinder or impede us in our labors, but sends us on with some increased exhilaration.</p> 
                  <p>Old Nacky, from creeping through the streets at a pace that makes her poverty impressive, will start off on a run in spite of the eighty years she must carry, to tell her neighbor that the sexton's child is dead.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">EPHRAIM ON EXHIBITION.</head> 
                  <p>ABRAHAM had returned to the cellar and was waiting there for Philly, when she went in. Her eyes fell on him as she opened the door, and I record it as a marvel, that, coming from the attic, and from looking at Wilhelm, the youth, old Abraham looked no older, no darker, no more withered and forlorn to Philly's eyes, than he had looked before. The pleased expression of Philly's face as she went up to him, was real and natural. With expectation she held the medallion before his eyes.</p> 
                  <p>"There! see that!" said she, proclaiming her own estimate in the words.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham took the medallion in his hands, and rubbed his eye, and looked at it near and far off. Philly watched him eagerly; and when he smiled, it was so great a satisfaction, that she laughed aloud- a true, sweet laugh. But he soon gave it back to her; after a very brief inspection. The figures entire, were no better than those broken into fragments, when it came to a choice between them and Philly.</p> 
                  <p>Still, he had the wisdom, or the instinct, to dwell<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6043-00000042"/> upon the subject that interested her. So while she sat down opposite him on the edge of the box, he began to question her about it. He did not need to push his interrogatory far-there was no reason why she should not voluntarily tell him her adventure.</p> 
                  <p>That, or any subject on which she chose to dwell, could interest Abraham. If she would only talk. For she was verily become the feature of that old man's thoughts, as also of his home, to whom heretofore home had been merely a cover from the night. He looked at Philly with a countenance whose every feature hearkened, and was pleased that she was pleased; and he took up the medallion, and praised it, because she admired it; and listened, while she explained its meaning, with an absorbed interest as we all listen to the speaking of those we love. For the cheerless heart of the old man was enlivened by the flame kindled there.</p> 
                  <p>His satisfaction, so plainly evident, pleased Philly; she attributed it all to his admiring regard for the medallion. And, encouraged by his manner, when, presently Ephraim came in, while they yet sat discussing its points, she gave him the medallion to look at.</p> 
                  <p>Eph's first question, as he just glanced at the figures, was the same as Abraham's, Where did she get it? But he did not let the matter drop when she had told him, as the old man seemed willing to do.</p> 
                  <p>Instead, he gave her back the bit of printed plaster, and proceeded to question her in his authoritative tive way-for he seemed to regard the girl as belonging to him-and had thus regarded her, until apparently she had yielded to, if she did not actually agree with, his way of thinking.</p> 
                  <p>What was she doing up the stair? If she was able to go out anywhere, she might as well have been in the street. What was the young man like? What did he say to her?</p> 
                  <p>As Eph proceeded with this questioning, Philly's manner changed toward him. The influence the old man had observed him exercise over her before, was exercised again. Her freedom and readiness of speech disappeared. She seemed unwilling to proceed, as she went on: unwilling to communicate the little she had to say of the young man up-stairs. She assigned no reason to herself why this was so. Ephraim thought it was her obstinacy; because she liked to set herself against him, and have a sort of conflict with him in the presence of another.</p> 
                  <p>His own love of authority, and desire for its display, rose with the supposed occasion. Self-government he would have felt to be a trespass on his rights, and their infringement was what he never could allow. Before this spectator, Abraham, he would exhibit his control over the girl.</p> 
                  <p>It was therefore no act of real self-control, but a mere disguising of his will, and so pursuance in secret of his desire, that led him into some mild talk about the work that he had done that day. Ere long he<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6043-00000043"/> had surprised Abraham into some expressions of amazement, and admiration, genuine and gratuitous, apparently, as he related various feats of strength which he had himself performed. Then he went off into a long braggadocial relation of the great deeds of valor which had distinguished his career from his youth up.</p> 
                  <p>Philly listened, as one who is accustomed to the tale, but never weary of it. If the impression she had brought down with her from the attic had indisposed her for such talk as this, the impression was gone or obscured for the moment; and she was anxious that Abraham should appreciate Ephraim. Her own comments proved that she had forgotten everything except his glory, now when that glory was being revealed. At the conclusion of each of his astounding paragraphs, she was ready with a note of exclamation, which Abraham echoed; or of interrogation, which she uttered, not for her own benefit, but for the old man's further enlightenment. She knew how to exhibit her friend.</p> 
                  <p>In all this, Ephraim forgot his own endeavor; in the rewards his vanity sought and found, he lost sight of the purpose at which, in the beginning of his narration, he had aimed. He had been seriously aggrieved as he thought, by Philly's admiration of the youth upstairs: admiration betrayed so honestly. He knew that up to this time he had been to her the great man of the world. And no man likes to be supplanted. There is a perceptible difference which the whole world understands between resigning a position, and being ejected from it. She was his charge besides-she invariably consulted him in affairs of any moment-he felt some pride in looking after such a girl, and in knowing that she relied on him; but here she had broken into a new path, and was indulging in a new enjoyment of which indeed she freely told him, but which he could not enter into, appreciate, or comprehend, and which she had discovered for herself.</p> 
                  <p>But he seemed now to have forgotten this cause of his displeasure. Philly's manner toward him in the present instance was as true an expression of her real thought as it had been when her speech was an offence. This physical strength, this power of bone and muscle which he magnified, was the very strength and power which made his greatness in her eyes. It expressed capabilities that were irresistible and imposing to her mind. Abraham, thin and feeble, had wakened Philly's pitying sympathy. She was his equal; perhaps his superior. She could sit down and talk with him cozily as with the old woman who had preceded him; or as she used to talk with little Jess, her protg. They were sure to be good friends. But "Ephrim" towered aloft. He was the giant that filled the whole sphere, when she, in accordance with the divine law, looked up. For strength and for valor, there was none like "Ephrim." He had his own renown. He was the autocrat among his class. His word, his look, was law. To Philly there was an irresistible fascination<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6043-00000044"/> tion in the physical force of this man. She yielded to its influence as she would have given way to any irresistible power of nature. It awed, while it excited her. It imposed upon her too. It never subdued her as one is subdued by fear, or consciousness of helplessness. For this reason, in their circle, Philly was a central figure with Ephraim. She had been known to stand out at times in open opposition to him, when no man or woman beside had dared to do it. She had come between him, and some object of his wrath, as a protector of weakness; she had spoken out against his decrees at times in the capacity of a peacemaker; and though occasionally she had received upon herself the storm of his rage, they had still been true friends always.</p> 
                  <p>The part she had taken in these encounters, at various times, had made Philly hardly less a person of note than was Eph, among those people. Some said they would be married yet. It seemed at times as if it might be so. For though occasionally she opposed his actions and decrees, it became ever constantly more evident that Philly was on the side of Eph. She might dissent from him, but he was still the greatest man she knew. She would choose him for her defender sooner than another. She felt secure while he was in the world. Christianity would make the philosopher of her-only, more profoundly-that without the Gospel, Eph made. In her extremity he had come forward and generously cared for her. While anything so strong as he was in the world, she might well be courageous, fearless, all-enduring. By his courage, all the courage of her own nature was elicited. If it proved in the end to be a moral courage of which he knew nothing, it was because their natures were so. The hardships he encountered strengthened Eph in bone and sinew. It might be that those of Philly would make her strong in spirit and in life.</p> 
                  <p>Admiringly she looked at Ephraim while he talked to Abraham, and she was even more desirous than the speaker that the old man should receive a true impression of the greatness that spoke. And as she looked from one to the other, her spirit and her heart were both drawn out, and her face brightened constantly with the pleasure she felt. So that when, warmed by the story of his own doings, and by her smile, for Philly was just now the greatest girl that lived, according to Eph's notion, he asked her to go down to Tabby's dancing-room with him, she gave her consent, without pausing to reflect upon it; and Abraham was amiable enough to express his willingness, though that demonstration was gratuitous. Ephraim did not set the old man to the difficult task of conning the fact. But caught by a view of the case which had escaped him, he turned his eyes upon Philly as she stood up ready to go with him, and exclaimed-</p> 
                  <p>"No; that's agin my nature to impose on yourn.<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6043-00000045"/> That eye, you know. It ain't fit to go out with. Getting hot with the dancing might be the end on it. Wait till to-morrow. I'll be round then."</p> 
                  <p>"I ain't afeard though, Eph. I'll go," said Philly; she would like nothing better than a stirring dance to-night.</p> 
                  <p>"No you won't," said he, laying his hand on her shoulder, and looking down upon her, really with admiration. "Afeard! I guess not. But it's Eph that's afeard this time-on your account, I never was that on my own. You'll need both of your eyes, sharp as they be, to get through this world."</p> 
                  <p>Philly's face grew red beneath his fixed look. He lifted his hand at length from her shoulder and let it fall to his side, and it swung heavily to and fro.</p> 
                  <p>"Won't she, old fellow?" he asked, turning to Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay," said he, "she will."</p> 
                  <p>"Then I'll keep 'em," said Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll stay in," said Eph, with a moderated authority, that had an almost amiable sound.</p> 
                  <p>"You won't go to climbing those cussed stairs again?"</p> 
                  <p>Philly laughed.</p> 
                  <p>"What?" asked he quickly.</p> 
                  <p>"No," she answered in good time, so well she understood the man.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll be going then," said he, turning himself about, and he went off.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Great fellow," said Abraham to Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"There's nobody like Eph," answered she.</p> 
                  <p>"I should think not."</p> 
                  <p>Then the old man and maiden began to reflect upon their words, musing in silence.</p> 
                  <p>At length Philly spoke; but not about Ephraim who was still the subject of Abraham's meditations.</p> 
                  <p>"I wish you could see those figgers and things the young man makes up-stairs," said she.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll go up and see 'em," promised Abraham, obligingly.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you, though - when?"</p> 
                  <p>"Any time. I'd go to-night, but for fear of breaking my neck in the dark. I dunno the way: - these fellows are so crusty - is he?"-</p> 
                  <p>"He? No!"</p> 
                  <p>"Not like Ephrim?"</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>Philly looked at the old man while she answered, as if she wondered at the question. But it was not the question, it was the thought suggested by it, that held her. How unlike Ephraim was that image-maker! How different in every way! How different also was the youth from Abraham-they were as unlike in their kindliness, as Ephraim and Wilhelm. The boys of her acquaintance were either vicious and weak, or cruel and strong. There was not one of them that could be compared with Eph. Wilhelm was all unlike him; yet he did not seem weak. She<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6043-00000046"/> remembered the ease with which he had lifted the board of images, from his head. How strong he looked, how resolute, and yet how quiet in his ways; how mild his voice was; how calm were his blue eyes.</p> 
                  <p>Eph excited her always to action-roused her to do her best-wakened her pride-called on her vanity. This youth, this image-maker, stirred her soul likewise, but not to make an exhibition of herself. She felt the influence in her spirit; it soothed and calmed her, while it inspired her to fresh exertion. What a sound it had, as she recalled the words, that he was working for his mother and his sister! To prepare a home for them, to bring them to it. This thought did what none of Ephraim's acts of prowess had ever done-did what they could never do-brought tears to her eyes.</p> 
                  <p>Her imagination, busied never before with scenes or thoughts of this kind which he had called up, and suggested, acted with the rapidity and vigor of a vital faculty, unused hitherto. Irregularly, extravagantly, in the novelty of its freedom, in the strangeness of its course, but powerfully, and it held her in its working.</p> 
                  <p>Philly did not place him on a level with herself-with Ephraim and Abraham, and the rest. Though he was poorly dressed, and everything around him told his poverty, yet he had the speech of a gentleman. Philly thought of his mother and sister not as beings to be compared with the like of her. She placed them on a higher range, and stood humbly in her place beneath-but she did this with a longing which sufficiently attested her fitness for an equal elevation, as all true longing is expressive of capacity.</p> 
                  <p>She restrained herself in good time, and gave herself none of her rightful liberty of meditation on that theme; but fell again to thinking, to wondering, what the young man's success would be. He seemed to entertain some doubts about it she knew; it pleased her to make his whole path straight. How could it be otherwise when he had so great a purpose always in his mind, and worked on so diligently to one end?</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim's charity had seemed to her one of those great acts of which a great nature alone is capable. It did not seem less to her now, but here was an act to mate with it. The German lad had not spoken of his enterprise as if it were a great one. But it was great. It was as much as she could manage to do to earn her bread, and the rags she wore, and pay for the cellar where she slept. It had taxed her to the utmost when she had endeavored to procure a few comforts for little Jess, during her last sickness. How was it possible that he should succeed in his great undertaking? yet he would certainly succeed she knew.</p> 
                  <p>These thoughts led suddenly out into a direction which Philly had not contemplated.</p> 
                  <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6043-00000047"/> 
                  <p>Why could she not learn to manage those tools with which he worked, as well as the boy Wilhelm? He had said it was easy work to do. And if she could not learn at present, why could she not carry that board about the streets for him, and sell the images? That would help him-he would thus save his time-and it might be that she could learn at length to do the same beautiful work. She would go up in the morning and ask him about it.</p> 
                  <p>She had given a promise that she would not go; just here, in the midst of the excitement of the new resolution she remembered that she had, and thereupon she counselled with herself, Ephraim would not wonder when she had explained all to him. He might feel offended, but she could certainly make good her cause-she should pacify him in good time. She had not promised him with the intention to deceive-she was not deceiving him. If she could find for herself some profitable business, he would reap the benefit as well as she. She should be able to pay so much the sooner the great debt she owed him. For that debt-though he declared that none existed-weighed upon her mind. She had felt it to be a heavy weight when he had now and then led her to remember that she owed her life to him. And at such times the obligation had lain upon her like a bond. The bare thought now that there might be a possibility of freeing herself from it, though she did not let the thought take this form precisely, filled her with valiant resolutions lutions, and firm purposes of success. The street-sweeping was not profitable. She had managed to live by it-but no more. It would never do for her to enter into competition with the old women who kept the stalls. She had outgrown her occupation as sweeper-it was time she undertook other labors.</p> 
                  <p>Twice Philly turned to Abraham to share with him these, her new convictions-to ask some counsel:-but the first time she did so her own impulse restrained her, and the second, when it seemed to her that she must speak her thoughts aloud, his heavy breathing told her that he was asleep.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">PHILLY AN ICONOCLAST.</head> 
                  <p>BEFORE the close of the next day, Philly found herself, sole possessor of her purpose, seeking an admission at the door of the attic chamber-seeking it in vain. The door was fast secured. She turned away disappointed, and went slowly down the stairs, more and more slowly descending with each step she took, until she had reached the last step; then without pausing there, instead of going forth into the street, she turned about, went up again, and sat down on the top stair, just by Wilhelm's door, to wait for his return.</p> 
                  <p>It grew darker and darker up the stairway, for there was no window in the passage, and the dusky light that came in at the door two flights below, faded and was quite overcome of darkness before it had passed half the upward distance.</p> 
                  <p>Tired out with her labor, and influenced by the sudden change from the noisy street to this dead quiet, from listening with a strained ear for his step, poor Philly fell asleep.</p> 
                  <p>The German boy came home at length-came whistling up the stairs-but Philly was asleep. Nearer and nearer he came, whistling still-but still she slept. Whistling to the last he came, until he stumbled against her, and the board which he was carrying on his head was thrown to the floor.</p> 
                  <p>Philly started up with a cry at the sound of the crash of the broken images; but the astounded youth uttered no echo-in silence he unlocked and threw open his door. Something he had said, a solitary word he had uttered-she heard his voice as she wakened, but what that word was she knew not-and was never like to know it seemed, when she looked at him, and perceived the consternation which his face could not conceal.</p> 
                  <p>But, looking at him in her amazement and affright, Philly saw no wrath upon his countenance. And that was what she looked for, conscious of deserving, when she saw him lift the board, and gather up <choice>
                        <sic>the the</sic>
                        <corr>the</corr>
                     </choice> fragments of the demolished images.</p> 
                  <p>She saw more than this explanation of what it was that had happened out there in the dark, while she was sleeping, when he came up into his room within the door of which she, apprehensive of she knew not what, had taken shelter. She saw a tear upon his cheek, and a sudden and strange flashing of his eyes, as they glanced for an instant toward her, and recognised her in that look. It was not such a glance as sometimes preceded Eph's terrific bursts of passion. It was a more intense-a purer fire. He did not<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6043-00000049"/> speak to her. He went on picking up the fragments of the images laying them in heaps on his table-Philly watched the process, and felt that it was heaping coals of fire on her head, but she found not a word to say, and dared not assist him.</p> 
                  <p>When he had gathered up the pieces he turned himself decidedly, as with a purpose, toward Philly, and with one hand on the door-latch, pointed down the stairway. But he spoke not a word.</p> 
                  <p>It was now or never with poor Philly. Instead of leaving his room, as he plainly, by his gesture, and the severity of his look, bade her do, she retreated farther into the attic, and said, with the voice of one who has some act of personal justice yet to perform:-</p> 
                  <p>"Did you fall over me?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," answered the youth, and evidently he would exact no further speech from himself. His voice faltered even in the utterance of that word. Then said Philly:-</p> 
                  <p>"I come up here to see you. That was what I come for. I had something I wanted for to say. But I can't say it now, after this." Here she paused and drew a long breath; and though he did not encourage her to continue in her speech, she went on: "I waited so long, and I was so tired that I went to sleep. I didn't hear you coming. I'm dreadful, dreadful sorry. I had rather have fallen down to break my neck, than have you tip them things over to get them broke up so as you have. Here's what I've got to-day by my work. Take it. I'll have more to-morrow, you shall have that too. I wish it was as much agin, ten times and twenty times as much." Here she advanced to the table and laid the pieces of money-very small the bits of silver were that shone among the copper-laid them on the table.</p> 
                  <p>She did it with a noble grace, with a freedom of gesture that of itself almost won her pardon of the youth. She was already forgiven by the apology she made-by her genuine sorrow, and by the amends she offered.</p> 
                  <p>"No," said he, shaking his head, and waving his hand toward the table in rejection of the money. Though he said merely this word, there was that in the voice, that in the look accompanying it, that restored Philly's self-possession and her courage, in some degree.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," she said with decision, "you'll take it before I stir from this. It's all I've got. I wish it was ten times as much. But you'll take that."</p> 
                  <p>"I will not," said he. "It was an accident-no fault of you. I was a bungle to come up with the board on my head-I won't again, I promise you. What is it you say?"</p> 
                  <p>"Put that money in your pocket," said Philly with authority.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want?" asked he. His face lightened<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6043-00000050"/> ened, the cloud had almost vanished-behind it shone the sun.</p> 
                  <p>"I want you to be paid. I want to buy some information. Will you take the money?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well," said he.</p> 
                  <p>Without questioning whether that might mean anything beside compliance with her wish, Philly, who had carefully observed the changing face before her, went on.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm tired of sweeping streets, and tending stalls. In your country, do women work at your trade?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not often," Wilhelm gravely answered.</p> 
                  <p>"I want to work at it," said she.</p> 
                  <p>"What for?"</p> 
                  <p>"I would like to."</p> 
                  <p>"Who could you work for?"</p> 
                  <p>"You." The youth smiled. But though Philly observed the smile it did not confuse her. "I'd carry the figgers about on the board, and pay you for showing me. I'm sure-footed. I'm used to pavements. <emph>I</emph> never should fall."</p> 
                  <p>"You get hurt sometimes."</p> 
                  <p>When he said that it seemed as if Philly's eyes were for the first time opened. Her face became scarlet-she trembled with her sorrow and her shame.</p> 
                  <p>She attempted to speak, but no words came. During moments of effort she struggled to no purpose. At last in the energy of her determination, the words came forth as if rent from her.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I'll not be hurt in the same way agin, I won't, I promise you. Can I learn that trade?"</p> 
                  <p>The youth was silent and perplexed when she demanded an answer to this question, for her words were full of urgency.</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe you might," he said slowly. And for very pity's sake he added: "when I get some more images made, you may try the streets, and see your luck, and then-"</p> 
                  <p>Philly sprang across the floor toward him-had it been Ephraim who inspired that feeling she would have thrown her arms about him, and embraced him forthwith, but she merely brought herself to a sudden stand-still, and partial composure, as she stood in that near presence, and said:-</p> 
                  <p>"You'll trust me then?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'd be willing with every cent I had, if there was need, and I had the money," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"You would?" she asked, with manifest rejoicing.</p> 
                  <p>"You are honest," he explained. "A good girl."</p> 
                  <p>She bowed and smiled at that, with a grace and dignity which expressed her nature truly.</p> 
                  <p>"I am," said she. And she laid her hand upon her breast, and her face bore witness to the truth. She needed no avoucher, none.</p> 
                  <p>"Now take that money," said she. "I'll never go till you do. Do by me as you'd have your sister done by."</p> 
                  <p>The young fellow started at these words, he looked<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6043-00000051"/> hastily at Philly as if doubting whether he heard aright. She stood there firm and quiet, waiting for him to do her bidding. The appeal was ultimate. As he would have his sister done by!</p> 
                  <p>He went up to the table, swept the money into his hand, bowed, looking at her-and then she was off.</p> 
                  <p>When she had left the room, Wilhelm laid the money down again on the table, and took up his tools, but before he went on with his work he surveyed the ruin that had fallen on a whole week's labor. Afterward, apparently not altogether cast down by the observation, he brought a bit of paper, wrapped Philly's money in it, and put it away in his pocket-then he resumed his toil. But he did not whistle or sing-and once he lifted his hand as if to brush away a tear, but the hand was arrested, and the tear fell. He saw it lying on the table-and gazed at it, pitying himself, until the thought of Philly swept over him like a fresh, reviving breeze; and the cause of his trouble became, by a strange process, simple enough, his consolation in it.</p> 
                  <p>Yet on the whole it was a night of gloom that descended upon him. In spite of his accustomed cheerfulness he could not shake off the depression that now fell upon him. He was by no means elated in view of the aid Philly had promised. Though he admired her words and conduct that night, though his eyes, which loved beauty, discovered something fair, something noble in her face, he would greatly have preferred to think that he had now said all that he should need say to the girl.</p> 
                  <p>Philly went slowly down the stairs, as if she were in no haste to remove herself from the neighborhood of that attic. But she said to herself as she descended the last flight, "It must be late. Eph will be in;" and that reflection hastened her steps. Not that she was impatient to make known to him the event of the last hour, but there might be a chance of preceding him in the cellar.</p> 
                  <p>Her premonition was a true one. Ephraim was there. But, contrary to her expectation, he did not call her to an account for her absence, immediately on her appearing. Neither asked where she had been, nor what she had been doing. He was busy, talking with Abraham; recording the remainder of the marvellous story begun on the previous evening-and Abraham's wonder was not yet exhausted. His astonishment, his exclamations, had once more brought the story-teller into his most amiable mood, so that when Philly came in he rose up, drew in a long breath, and stretched himself to his full height, as if her coming were all he waited for-as if he had merely entertained the old man because he must be doing something to pass away the time. And what he had said could only be wonderful to a mind as simple as Abraham Black's.</p> 
                  <p>Nevertheless, Abraham Black's eye followed him as he arose and went toward Philly, with that strange<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6043-00000052"/> human look that is always in the eyes of the multitude when they are in the presence of a hero.</p> 
                  <p>From his coat-pocket Ephraim now produced a small paper roll, which he bade Philly open. She, congratulating herself on finding him in this mood, obeyed, and unfolded to view a gay-colored riband, rich and fine.</p> 
                  <p>"There," said Ephraim, "fix yourself off pretty with that, and come down with me to Tabby's. There'll be <choice>
                        <sic>some some</sic>
                        <corr>some</corr>
                     </choice> firstrate music to-night."</p> 
                  <p>Philly was quite ready to go. Ephraim, in his gracious moods, never found her ungracious. Relieved that he asked no questions, and grateful for his remembrance, she was now all the more ready to accept his invitation. For a moment she stood holding the riband daintily on one finger up to view, as a belle might have done in her own sacred dressing-room, and in the dim light of the cellar the two men saw her and it.</p> 
                  <p>She smoothed her hair; she bound the riband round her wounded eye-she let the ends of the gay bandage hang down her back. So she was dressed for the evening. A gay young girl-a belle-going out to dance part of the night away. She might have been better dressed-she might have been more gallantly attended.</p> 
                  <p>The old man would have had them share his loaf before they went, but Ephraim said they should find entertainment elsewhere, and so he hurried Philly off. And, though the night was dark, he did not offer Philly his arm, nor yet his hand, but let her follow on.</p> 
                  <p>No sooner had they emerged into the street than he asked, "Where have you been, Philly?"</p> 
                  <p>The unexpectedness of the question disconcerted her, and Ephraim saw that it did, and with an expression one might suppose peculiar to the countenances of those who presided in the old time at the rack, he held her to the question-repeating it. Philly's answer, ready now, and unconcerned, was sufficient to disarm him.</p> 
                  <p>"I went up," said she.</p> 
                  <p>"Up where?"</p> 
                  <p>"To the figger-boy's room, much to his cost, poor dear."</p> 
                  <p>"What do you call him poor dear for?" asked Ephraim, seizing upon that word, as Philly no doubt intended he should.</p> 
                  <p>"He has such a beautiful, sweet face," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"You're a fool," said Ephraim. "What do you mean by saying it's to his cost?"</p> 
                  <p>"I sat down on the stairs to wait, and he fell over me coming up, and all the figgers went to smash."</p> 
                  <p>Eph laughed at this in earnest. Philly had calculated well on the effect that would be produced by the intelligence. Ill-nature is never put into good humor so speedily as by the hearing of some accident or misfortune that has befallen his neighbor. Philly was as<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6043-00000053"/> shrewd as the most of women. She had succeeded thus in diverting Ephraim's attention from the main point. But presently he returned to it.</p> 
                  <p>"What did you want up there? You said you'd keep away."</p> 
                  <p>"I wanted to look at them figgers again. But I stood a poor chance, with 'em all broke up so."</p> 
                  <p>"Served you right," said Eph; "you'll keep your word another time, may be."</p> 
                  <p>He spoke pleasantly, and Philly was content that he should rest with the information he had now received. She would prefer to take Abraham into her confidence and consult with him in respect to her future plans, rather than Eph.</p> 
                  <p>He would be sure to bluster and swear, and forbid her acting her own pleasure, as he always did, though it would be hard to tell on what authority; but in the end she would be likely to pursue her own course, and accomplish her original purpose. Such a contest, though it would result in her doing as she chose, Philly would not like now to encounter.</p> 
                  <p>"You're cold and stiff," said Ephraim, as they went on their way for some distance in silence. "We'll get something to warm you up and loosen your tongue in a minit."</p> 
                  <p>Unresisting Philly went with him into the beer-shop over the "hall," where they met for their evening entertainment. Eph tossed down his money for the glasses he ordered, with the manner of a lord, and led Philly out by the arm when they had drank the same.</p> 
                  <p>But the beer seemed to fail of its proper effect, Philly's mind was distracted by a multitude of thoughts. She would have chosen to talk with Abraham about her prospects in following the new trade-to hear his advice-she would have chosen to sit alone and think about it, though solitude and meditation were not her frequent choice; but here was Ephraim reproaching her for her stupidity, observing her with jealous eyes; and a company of dancers, each of whom had a demand to make on her.</p> 
                  <p>She rose with this reflection, and answered the occasion. It would soon be all over, and she should be alone. These young people, boys and girls, were kind to her, she must be kind to them. So Philly argued with herself, and went out of herself, and was a queen that night.</p> 
                  <p>The room seemed as if under some potent influence when her spirits began to rise. Her laughter unrestrained, free, but not harsh, nor coarse even, was like the key-note for the other voices: her face was as potent in the influence of its expression. The very fiddler seemed inspired by her spirits and energy, and drew his bow with many a vigorous flourish of which he had been hitherto incapable.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim perceived this change in the atmosphere of the room, and traced the result directly to its cause.</p> 
                  <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6043-00000054"/> 
                  <p>"You see how it is," said he to Philly. "You give them the card, and they all follow suit. Keep up the game. You're enjoying of it now yourself."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Philly, and her face did not belie her word. But neither the desires of those around her, nor the music, nor the wish of Eph, was her leading inspiration. Her hope had become her certainty. She had ceased to count the chances of future success; was willing to take this present triumph as an earnest of that which should come. She was thinking of the time when she should make beautiful figures in a quiet room above ground-when she should sell them to admiring purchasers to be put in the parlors of handsome houses. Thinking of the time when she should have money to pay Eph with-and after that, they would be different toward each other. He would not speak to her then as he did now, and drive her to her wit's end in the endeavor to manage him, because she was afraid that he would actually manage her, as indeed he seemed to do, and really believed he did.</p> 
                  <p>These two persons were the prominent characters of the company that gathered in this dancing-room of Tabby's, night after night. The sort of deference generally paid them by their surroundings told their standing and position. Ephraim, or Eph, as they called him through their ranks, was regarded as the master of all the ceremonies conducted there, and Philly was looked upon as his mate. He rarely danced except with her, and with her but once or twice during the evening. He chose to walk about and take the general management, or lounge upon the benches, as a king might on his throne, while the dancers danced before him.</p> 
                  <p>Philly's example among those girls had its influence and real weight; though but for Eph's patronage there were many others, older than she, and following more desirable trades, who might have seemed better adapted to fill the place, though not to fill its conspicuity. She had the popular manners, the obliging nature, which will not admit an imitation; but they all studied her to learn her charm-just as is done in other circles-but just as happens there, did happen here. The imitators stopped short of the acts which made the charm of Philly's character: they might imitate her words and looks, but they were too slothful, or too selfish, to do her deeds. Which one of them would ever have thought of inviting hunchback Jim, Tabby's waiter in general, to join in the dance? which one of them but Philly? The management might seem to be on Ephraim's hands, but it was still more on Philly's. It was she who saw if any poor girl were neglected in a corner. If any old man went to sleep behind the stove, incurring the danger of burning his brains out there.</p> 
                  <p>Philly was at the same time wiser and better than her surroundings. Her wisdom then, it may be said, should have kept her altogether from such scenes and influences as she shared in, and received here. She<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6043-00000055"/> was in the condition to which she had been born. The same virtue of character that would deliver her from it, would make of you a seraph.</p> 
                  <p>With a vision that seldom erred, she saw the natures around her; and she was growing every day. Eph, as has been said before, was the strongest character she knew. But she was beginning to wonder at his bluster, and to weary of his conceit.</p> 
                  <p>She was bound to him by gratitude, and by an appreciation of his character. She could forgive, or rather overlook much that displeased her, for the sake of much that gave him precedence over others whom she knew. She was imposed upon, moreover, by the seeming generosity with which he spent his money. It was no lavish expenditure that he ever really made, but it seemed such to Philly, who was compelled to make so much of the paltry pence she earned. He had never refused to aid her when she went to him with the story of some extreme necessity that had come to her knowledge. These things had conspired in her mind to the formation of that high opinion which would cover a multitude of sins. She was ever swift to remember all the good of him she knew, when he became violent and terrible in his conduct toward others. No one ever attempted toward him what she attempted. She was the only peace-maker, the only really courageous soul among those wild natures. Ephraim himself was not ashamed to be brought back to his senses by her interpositions. True, he would thrust her aside, and curse her, when she interfered, in his moments of passionate dispute with others. But it was generally felt throughout the company that when she had spoken, pacific results would speedily appear.</p> 
                  <p>So she was treated with general respect on this account-as a lion-tamer;-and when she appeared this night with her eye bandaged by the riband, she was received as one who has been wounded in an honorable cause-though wounds and scars were not rare among those faces.</p> 
                  <p>Many were the inquiries made for her on the two evenings of her absence; and it was on account of them, and to restore himself to favor, which had somewhat waned, though his authority had not one jot abated, that Ephraim had been solicitous for her reappearing, and had indulged in the riband extravagance.</p> 
                  <p>"Was it dull here last night?" asked Philly of him as they stood together watching the dancers.</p> 
                  <p>"Dull-nothing doing," he answered.</p> 
                  <p>"What if I shouldn't come here again-never?" asked Philly; serious enough in the question, though the archness of her look cast a doubt upon the fact.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim looked at her, but did not reply, as if the question were too idle.</p> 
                  <p>"They are such a dull set," explained Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm here," said he drily.</p> 
                  <p>"You're a good fellow, Ephrim."</p> 
                  <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6043-00000056"/> 
                  <p>He looked at her as a lion surveys the courage that dares to stroke his name. She met the look without betraying the slightest disturbance on its account.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you mean?" said he; for he anticipated a lair or lure of some sort. He was always on the alert to meet her woman-craft: too swift commonly. She was so much greater, so much better than he could apprehend, he required of her continual explanation.</p> 
                  <p>"I mean you are my friend," she said, and that satisfied him.</p> 
                  <p>All the cunning which Philly's way of life had provoked from her nature, was such cunning as a good nature could make use of, even under full conviction of the truth that honesty is the best policy. If ever the worst passions of our nature were excited in her, it was the best feature of such passions that became apparent. She was incapable of vicious trickery, but self-preservation was the instinct earliest and most frequently called into action, during the course of her life. It was but natural that she should be adroit, and capable of management, equal to a skilful conduct of her affairs. It was on this account also that she was so highly esteemed among her companions. She was so admirably capable of taking care of herself: so nobly independent.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim indeed, to come to the fact of the case, regarded her as a young peer, a younger brother. Observers looked at one another and smiled when they saw these two together. But Eph was not Philly's lover.</p> 
                  <p>It is true he had sometimes thought of marrying her. She was wholly on his hands he seemed to think-to dispose of as he would-and this notion was merely in keeping with his habits of thought. Philly herself offered no obstruction to the free course of the notion. Though she was ever in various ways asserting her independence of him, still, the general impression of her dependence seemed to remain. If ever he had felt the need of consulting with any person, on any subject, he would no doubt have consulted with Philly; for he considered her about his equal in judgment. But, as for himself, he never needed the counsel of any one. He would have had no hesitation in asking her aid, if he needed any help ever. But he never needed any help. She exercised over him a certain measure of restraint, such as the younger members of a family sometimes exert over the elder. And there was the fact that their names had often been coupled together in his hearing, and the fact that he was generally looked upon as her escort, so that no other person ever came in his way. He would not let her go out when her wound was yet fresh. When she was sick he looked after her. The thought of her seemed at times to lift him out of himself; to come between him and his raging thoughts, with an influence wonderfully soothing. He watched her, sometimes, when she was talking with<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6043-00000057"/> other lads, and if he could not get at the secret of her influence over others and himself, he could perceive the working of that influence, could discern too, as he could not in others, that this nature, so frank, so open, so innocent-for thus they all styled her-had a depth of which none of those around her gave an indication.</p> 
                  <p>Eph and Philly had frequented the theatre together, but no one of their stage-queens was her model. He had never seen her attempt to ape the graces of either comedian or tragedian-her own grace was more positive and more remarkable than their art. It was to emerge into the region of the ideal, though he knew it not, to sit in some dark corner, and watch her face's changing expressions; to watch her in animation or repose.</p> 
                  <p>He had thought at times, that, as a matter of course, he should, if ever so disposed, marry Philly. But an intelligent observer would hardly have arrived at the same conclusion.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE LADY.</head> 
                  <p>AND in truth, very recently another influence has been operating silently, and unperceived by Ephraim-operating in, and over him.</p> 
                  <p>It is indicated-though he is not on the alert to detect the meaning-nor does any one perceive it-indicated by the approach, which he perceives, toward the bench whereon he reposes at full length, his head resting against a corner of the wall, a position he has taken for the better observation of the dancers-by the approach to this corner of a girl not so youthful as Philly. In height and shape they may not be unlike, but the spirit that informs the two lives is very different. They call the girl "the Lady," and the appellation has not the sound of a misnomer-Charlotte, her name is. She has a pretty and pleasing face. Simple and doll-like in its pink and white-but for the eyes, a very simple face; but there is something in them that might be called sharpness, or craft and cunning, according to the perception of the observer.</p> 
                  <p>Her self-possession equals Philly's-but it has another source and demonstration. She is unconscious<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6043-00000058"/> in her own being of all that gives to Philly the intensity of life. She does her work and her dancing with equal equanimity. She is never witty, never bright-never stupid, never dull. If Philly has a rival this, her very opposite, is she.</p> 
                  <p>Latterly the Lady has been exerting an influence after her own noiseless, undemonstrative fashion, for whose result she alone is anxious and prepared. It is over Ephraim that it is designed to operate-and over him it has been acting. But it has never moved him yet. The hero is indeed a ponderous body to attack-one would think that a sledge-hammer or a broad axe were the proper instruments; but Charlotte's instinct teaches better.</p> 
                  <p>As she comes near, most noticeable fact, Ephraim starts from his reclining attitude, rises, stands up, and is not conscious that this is an unwonted act of courtesy on his part. The pink and white, and the quiet manner move him to this courtesy.</p> 
                  <p>She sits upon the bench-he takes his place beside her. But now Ephraim does not fall to talking of himself. It is of anything, everything. Seeking to amuse her-with all his confidence now so little confident! And he fears, she is so quiet, that he shall not be successful, and he strikes out again and again into new effort. This is all unwonted doing on the part of Ephraim. He persists in this course when at a loss to know whether he succeeds in interesting her or not. How anxious he is as to the result. He is never so anxious about anything between himself and Philly. Even when words run high between them, and there is much misunderstanding, he always takes it for granted that affairs will arrange themselves between them. But now he is anxious that all shall be straight and clear.</p> 
                  <p>In an emergency he would call on Philly to serve him as a champion-but in every case the Lady would need a defender. It will be perceived that if she aroused Ephraim's interest in the least, her influence over him would be quite the reverse of Philly's.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim had a print upon his garret wall-no recent purchase-a red and white face with black eyebrows, and long black hair, loosely hanging. He thought the other day that it bore a singular resemblance to Charlotte, and took Philly up to see if it were not so. It satisfied him on the whole that she could not perceive the likeness-it gave him a sense of possession that he could call this the Lady's face, and remain alone in the secret possession of the resemblance.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte had a low voice-whatever she said was musical in its sound-when she laughed it was precisely as though she had learned in a drawing-room.</p> 
                  <p>It seemed strange that she should find any attractive power in Eph. He had never rendered her any special service-nor devoted himself to her, even in any general way. They had met and parted-and were becoming more and more the subjects of each<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6043-00000059"/> other's influence. How quietly, how secretly, how gradually, the fact that their acquaintance was of more than a year's standing, testifies.</p> 
                  <p>But the time was coming, or had come, when one of them had quickened to the fact that concerned her. Charlotte had become quite conscious of her admiration for the man. She merely knew the fact, however; it was not for her to understand, or to account for it.</p> 
                  <p>He acts on her not as on Philly. That were impossible. Philly is more than Ephraim's rival in all heroism, his equal in valor. The lady is merely an observer. It is ever his aim to stand well with such as are merely observers.</p> 
                  <p>It is beside an unknown ground he occupies-that fact invites him. The path is strange, and the prospect vague enough to be alluring. He can understand Philly by himself. She is, he thinks, so like him in many respects. But this other character is open to discovery.</p> 
                  <p>But now, as to this straight-browed, black-eyed, black-haired, fair-faced Charlotte, "the Lady," she was not in reality so calm a lady as she looked. She did not sail along the current so smoothly as she seemed to do. Impressions were made slowly on her mind-but, they were indelible when made. She was as passionate and jealous in her newly-developed love for Ephraim, as Cleopatra, and about as merciful. Philly she looked upon as her rival. Philly was therefore the subject of her constant observation.</p> 
                  <p>Her companions said among themselves, that Ephraim and Philly would be married, sooner or later. Eph always came and went with Philly. If he danced, he danced with her. The perfect understanding existing, apparently, between them, countenanced the rumor, bore it out. And so it was that Philly, bright and cheerful-brave-a light to all around her, became a darkness and a snare to Charlotte. She stirred up wicked and cruel thoughts in the Lady's brain. Under that fair exterior stood the proper form, the spirit of the girl-not fair, not red and white, not quiet;-black, deformed-never at rest, jealous, designing.</p> 
                  <p>A spirit watching with strained ear and eager eye, with attention which nothing eluded, the whole life of Philly. That life came under her entire inspection. Nothing that concerned Philly escaped her knowledge. Charlotte's nature seemed to undergo a total change with this love, and this jealousy. Not to observation, but to her own consciousness. It was, however, not a change but a developed nature. A nature excited to its most powerful and effective illustration. She was timid and dependent, Ephraim imagined; so in truth, after her own manner, but not as he supposed. There was no deed that she would have feared to attempt, might she but stand in the place that Philly held. She could not perceive that she<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6043-00000060"/> had already found a passage nearer to the heart of Ephraim than Philly might discover.</p> 
                  <p>She lived among lawless people, and her lot from her birth had been among such. The liberty and range she gave to her feeling in regard to her fancied rival would not be likely to strike her conscience as an unlawful liberty. And it did not.</p> 
                  <p>She sat now with Ephraim upon the bench, observing, with him, all that passed before them.</p> 
                  <p>"I remember the first time Philly did that thing," said Eph, as Philly and the hunchback danced together. His eyes were full of approval as he spoke; Charlotte fancied she saw far more in them, and did not by any comment express her thoughts, either of admiration or dissent.</p> 
                  <p>She looked on in silence; and Ephraim, not understanding the silence, continued:-</p> 
                  <p>"Not one of 'em would a' thought of such a thing but her. Look at Jim! She does him proud. No wonder."</p> 
                  <p>"They all think so when their turn comes," said Charlotte.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, they do," assented Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"What makes 'em?" asked she.</p> 
                  <p>"What makes 'em?" pondered Eph; "why, you know best, being of the same sort."</p> 
                  <p>"I? Who says I'm the first bit like Philly?"</p> 
                  <p>"I say so," maintained Eph, stoutly. "Who can hold a candle to either of you two girls?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>Charlotte was silent-she was yet in doubt as to the real value to be attached to this sort of compliment. Eph was silent also. Was he thinking of Philly? his eyes were upon her. Nothing that concerned him escaped Charlotte's observation; to divert his seemingly absorbed attention, she said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Whenever I come here I'm not sorry for it. But it would be dull if it warn't for her."</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim felt that he blushed as he heard these words-so like in sentiment the words he had himself but now spoken to Philly. His eyes dropped in the momentary confusion; but he instantly lifted them again, and fixed them on the Lady.</p> 
                  <p>"Dull, if what you want is noise," said he. "If you can't get enough of that out in the streets with the carts and omnibuses."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you call Philly's fun like that noise?" asked Charlotte, as if she resented the notion. But it was only to assure herself that her ears had not deceived her.</p> 
                  <p>"It is a comfort to be where it's still," said he, evasively. She seemed so amiable in her praise of Philly, that he felt the contrast of his meanness, and was ashamed of it.</p> 
                  <p>"You think so 'cause you can be out where there's something going on. If you was a poor girl, like me, shut up in a lonesome room all day-driv with work-no one to speak to, no time to think of anything cheerful and lively, till I come here for a minute to<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6043-00000061"/> look on and see the rest enjoy! I like to hear the music, and see the dancing. It isn't noise to me-it's pleasant."</p> 
                  <p>Poor Eph! his great face shone like the sun with satisfaction, and the cloud that was in sight was glowing with sympathetic lustre.</p> 
                  <p>"Is it such a quiet place you live in ?" said he.</p> 
                  <p>"There's nothing there but me, and work, and thinking," sighed she.</p> 
                  <p>"Thinking ... What about, I wonder?"</p> 
                  <p>The lady hesitated. She looked at Eph; his eyes were fastened on her. Her own dropped to the floor then-her cheek flushed, her lip quivered. With an unsteady voice she answered:-</p> 
                  <p>"What should a girls like me be thinking of? Work, to be sure-till the time shall come to quit."</p> 
                  <p>"When does that come?" asked Eph, with increasing interest and sympathy.</p> 
                  <p>"When I'm worked out," replied she. "And when the time comes to quit, I shall be dead. That's what I meant. I must be off now. I've got work yet to do. Good night. I wish I were a man, I'd know then when my work was done. You can fight your way. I might too if I was different; if I was even like your Philly."</p> 
                  <p>"My Philly!" said Eph. He had a thousand things to say-he could express himself most readily with Philly's name upon his lips. "What makes you say that?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Oh, nothing. Only what everybody means. I wish I was like her."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't," exclaimed he. "Hold on. I'll see you home."</p> 
                  <p>"I always go alone," said she, going out.</p> 
                  <p>But he followed close behind her; and he made her take his arm. He would fain have borne her in his arms to have saved her the fatigue of that walk home, his pity for her was so much aroused. This feeling, this pity, he had never felt for Philly: as if where she was weak, just there he was most strong; but he felt all the chivalry of a protector walking by this girl's side-nothing would have pleased him better than to proclaim hostilities against her adverse fortune.</p> 
                  <p>"What does everybody mean that talks about my Philly? What did <emph>you</emph> mean yourself?" said he, as they neared the Lady's lodgings.</p> 
                  <p>"The same that you mean," she answered, "that she belongs to you."</p> 
                  <p>"She don't," said Eph.</p> 
                  <p>The Lady laughed a doubt that made him swear he spoke the truth.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, it makes no difference," she commented, with a sigh-a sigh, be it observed, that went straight into Eph's heart.</p> 
                  <p>In the hall where they had left her, Philly went through the dance with Jim. But it was not without an effort, even a violent one, that she saw, as though<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6043-00000062"/> she saw not, while Ephraim and the Lady stood and talked together. When they left the room her eyes followed till Eph closed the door behind him-her thought went on with them when she could see no longer.</p> 
                  <p>Still the violin sounded-still she moved through the figures with spirit, as she had moved, and Jim bore her company. He could not read her thoughts. Her face had lost none of its brightness to his eyes. When he spoke to her she answered with a voice still kind-the kindest voice it was to him he ever heard; the violin gave never forth, at whatsoever touch, so sweet a sound as that. You would not call it sweet-but rich in heartiness-and that was melody to Jim.</p> 
                  <p>No. Wondering and sad she may have felt; but no one was the wiser for her wonder and her sadness. Many times while he stood talking with the Lady looking at him, Philly failed to meet his glance. Now she believed he had intentionally avoided her. For the first time since they frequented that hall together, he had left her. ... yet, she did not believe that he had left her now. He would certainly return. She had no curious pride, no wounded pride to satisfy-she did not make haste to leave the hall before he should return, if return was his intention, that he might wonder and experience some displeasure on that account and follow her to make apology for his neglect. To do this did not occur to her. She sat down instead, and waited. She would dance no more that night So she said to the young men who sought her. With her eyes wandering almost constantly toward the door, she sat waiting till Ephraim should appear.</p> 
                  <p>Philly, it will be presumed, had fallen into the general habit of regarding Ephraim as pre-eminently, exclusively, her companion attendant. In some way, as he certainly had been accustomed to assert, in one manner and another, she had felt that she belonged to him. She felt so still. At some intervals, when glimpses of a higher and a better life than hers, broke in upon her mind, she felt it in the form of an uncomfortable conviction. As a bird might sit within its nest and contemplate a flight-but if the tree were struck down by a sudden hurricane!</p> 
                  <p>It was much the same with Philly that it is with any other young girl, whose heart is opened to forebodings of a lost security...</p> 
                  <p>Though a fortune be a trouble to one, how many are there but find joy in groaning on under that weighty burden!</p> 
                  <p>How many kings in all the ages have laid aside their crown and sceptre for the robes of men of prayer?</p> 
                  <p>Eph's peculiar influence and power had been the occasion of frequent disturbance, had occasioned much unrest in Philly's mind from time to time. But she had never until now found occasion to contemplate the probability of a dissolution of their partnership.</p> 
                  <p>Of this same partnership Ephraim was thinking as<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6043-00000063"/> he walked back to Tabby's. He thought of it standing on the sidewalk before the steps that led down to the basement where the dancing was still going on. He hesitated, standing there and thinking; hesitated whether he should go in for Philly that night. Whether he should not show to her and others that she did not belong to him, nor he to her. He descended the steps, still deliberating. He looked in, while he stood there, through the parted curtain, doubting not that she was still the leader of the merriment that was going on.</p> 
                  <p>But-he saw her sitting, a looker-on-alone. Apparently not observing the dancers-but waiting and watching-and he doubted not it was for him. He deliberated then no longer. Their friendship was too real to admit of further hesitation now. He liked not to see her sitting there so grave-alone. He had never seen her thus before in any scene of festivity. Reproaching himself for that seeming sadness, he entered the room again, and went up to her at a more rapid pace than his usual slow stride.</p> 
                  <p>It was to her that he returned! She saw him pause an instant when he closed the door behind him, saw the glance he cast around the room, and then the directness with which he came instantly toward her. Nothing of all this was lost on Philly. She was strong and brave-she was herself again.</p> 
                  <p>Still-she had been thinking during his absence-that if he did return, if he did go home with her, as he invariably did, she would ask him the question that was agitating her mind. She would consult with him about her future course. She felt now, when he was actually returned, that it would be easy to do this. A moment ago, while all was doubt respecting that return, she had feared it would be impossible.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you say one jig more?" asked Ephraim, throwing himself upon the bench where she was seated.</p> 
                  <p>"No-I'm going now," answered Philly, in her usual friendly way.</p> 
                  <p>"I was thinking of joining in the fun myself,"said he.</p> 
                  <p>"Why not?" asked Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"It all depends on you," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh no, Ephrim, it don't. You need not go."</p> 
                  <p>"You'll dance then?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not to-night."</p> 
                  <p>"Come away then. I'm ready."</p> 
                  <p>"But if you want to dance-I'm not so very tired, Ephrim."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes you be," said Eph, hastily, "I see that. You've done your share here to-night, like a good girl as you be. So now I'll see you home."</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim had seldom spoken in a voice or strain like this. He seemed to recognise her womanhood now; to feel that she could weary, and that she needed protection. That which the Lady had wakened, or stirred in his nature, made him both gener-<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6043-00000064"/> ous and gentle. He could not interpret his own feeling; Philly could not interpret it-though she may have instinctively perceived it. It was the feeling that glorifies the meanest natures that can retain it, and makes royal spirits even more royal still.</p> 
                  <p>Philly had more confidence in speaking with him, as they went down the street toward the alley, and the cellar in the alley-more confidence than she had ever felt before. She had more to say to him of serious speech than she had ever found to say. So had her mind opened-so had her thoughts quickened-in their working, during the few past hours, and more especially during the last hour.</p> 
                  <p>"Eph," she began when the moment came for her to speak, "Ephrim, what do you think? Am I too big to be a sweeping of crossings now? That's what I was told in the streets."</p> 
                  <p>"I think you be," said Eph. "Yes, you be," he continued with emphasis, endorsing his own words. He never at any time kept one waiting long for his opinion: it was at all times, and on all occasions, ready. He concluded now that Philly had contemplated some new business for herself, and was curious in regard to it. The greater independence she should evince in the choice and the pursuit, the better pleased would he be. But he did not think it was so with himself.</p> 
                  <p>"What can I do best, Ephrim?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>These were not the words he had anticipated, and dark suspicion of some trap laid somewhere for his unwary feet, crossed the strong man's mind. He liked not the consultation. Still he said, without betraying his real feeling, said with spirit and honesty-</p> 
                  <p>"Play in the theatre, Phil."</p> 
                  <p>"You've said that before, Ephrim. You said it in fun then. But I'm in earnest now."</p> 
                  <p>"So'm I. I said it, and I say it agin, for the lots of money you'll make. You'll draw, Phil-you'll draw: no mistake."</p> 
                  <p>"No," answered Philly, "I shan't."</p> 
                  <p>"You allers liked the play," remonstrated Eph; for he was in earnest still.</p> 
                  <p>"But lookin' on aint doin' it, Ephrim. I couldn't do it. I liked the lookin' on. That's all. It's hard work, they say. Don't the women look as if it was? You can see it through the paint."</p> 
                  <p>"Now that's the way you'd come it!" muttered Eph with a thoroughly skeptical sneer, in which however there was no ill nature or severity. "To be talking about hard work! You know, Phil, nothing ever come hard to you in the world. You'd take the lead of all of 'em. You'd be the first-best of a play-actor."</p> 
                  <p>"How would I go to work, Eph?" she asked. It would not do to dispute with him further here. Therefore she asked the question.</p> 
                  <p>"You'd go to the manager, Phil, and says you, I've come to learn the play.' And a man with two eyes<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6043-00000065"/> wouldn't have to look at a girl like you, Phil, more than once to know what card he'd throw next."</p> 
                  <p>"He'll look a many times afore he gets the chance to say the word," said she. "Ephrim, what do you advise me for that way?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well-what'll ye do?-what'll ye do?" asked Ephraim.</p> 
                  <p>Yesterday-any other day of their life-he would not have spoken in this tone upon this question. But she seemed to be taking her fortune into her own hands, and he appeared to feel more curiosity than concern in her manner of management.</p> 
                  <p>Philly felt his words. They had in them just the interest of a partial indifference, of a perfect irresponsibility. As if he had shaken her off his hands. She knew this was the truth. Instinctively she felt it-and more and more distinctly. With a double purpose of inquiry, she asked-</p> 
                  <p>"What business is the Lady in now, Eph?"</p> 
                  <p>"She sews," said he, disagreeably impressed by the question. It seemed to involve much more than appeared.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" was her only comment.</p> 
                  <p>"Can you do that?" he asked. He knew she could not.</p> 
                  <p>"I never had time to learn," she answered thoughtfully.</p> 
                  <p>"If you had you couldn't make it go, no more than I could. Look at your hands. Be they like hers? You must be stirring about. She could sit from morning till night and never feel it-she's so deuced still. But you're up to something else, Phil. You'd make a good hack-driver: never 'ud nothing be ahead of you.'</p> 
                  <p>Philly felt, if she did not know how to express, her indignant sense of this summary expulsion from the field of womanly labors, into the midst of the thoroughfare's confusion, and the driver's ambition.</p> 
                  <p>She shook her hand free from Eph's that held it: it was easy to do so now. With every word recently spoken the distance had been widening between them. If their walk continued much further they would part without regret-for both of them were thinking of each other calmly now.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm not going to the theatre," said Philly; "and you say I can't sit still and sew things: what can I do then? Tell me if you can. You know all the works folks do to live by. Tell me what I can do, if you know."</p> 
                  <p>It was the last time that Philly would ever ask that question of him. But neither he nor she caught all that was betrayed in the low-speaking, rapid voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Learn to make them figgers," answered Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you think I could make it go?" asked Philly and it seemed as if she spoke with indifference; but it was, instead, a desperate sort of calmness that appeared in her composure.</p> 
                  <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6043-00000066"/> 
                  <p>"There's nothing like trying," answered Ephraim abstractedly.</p> 
                  <p>"Would you be willing, Eph?" How far she ventured saying this!</p> 
                  <p>"I!" It would not have greatly startled Philly, had a yes followed that brief, single utterance.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course you would. Who knows? It's queer though you'd say it, Ephrim."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE WOMEN.</head> 
                  <p>THAT ended their conversation, for with it, they came to the cellar-steps.</p> 
                  <p>When Ephraim left Philly, unawares it might be, he made his way around the square into the lane where the Lady lived, and found himself again before the house where he had but now left her.</p> 
                  <p>But the house-front was darkness-no sign or sound of life proceeded through any door or window.</p> 
                  <p>Eph could have given no satisfactory answer, had the privileged watchman, passing by, questioned him as to why he stood there leaning against a lamp-post; for he would not have confessed, this great, stout fellow, famous for his prowess, that he was in a revery, dreaming of a pair of black eyes, and a pink and white face, a woman very different from Philly.</p> 
                  <p>While he stood there, a light was struck in the room directly fronting him, and he saw Charlotte standing with a lamp in her hand. He started forward when he saw her, but checked his impulse with surprising self-control, and stood hesitating there upon the pavement with his eyes fixed on the window.</p> 
                  <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6043-00000067"/> 
                  <p>She placed the lamp upon the table, and sat down beside it; and her head bent to her work. She did not look up again, but seemed absorbed in her task, whatever it might be. Eph remembered how she had spoken of the lonely, quiet life she led. He had here an exhibition of one of that life's features. Very attractive did it seem to him. He could not resist its fascination. He would go in and visit her, instead of searching elsewhere for amusement; for it was not yet midnight, and sleep was the least prized of Ephraim's luxuries.</p> 
                  <p>Inside the Lady's room he had never yet adventured-until now, he had never felt the desire to do so. But now the desire possessed him, and he hurried in toward the house, drawn by that impulse.</p> 
                  <p>When he knocked, with a most strange gentleness, upon the door, the Lady within started. Just then Charlotte was thinking of him. Could it be he? She hoped, and she feared-though it was but a gentle knock-and she was not a timid woman.</p> 
                  <p>She arose from her table and opened the door, and seeing Ephraim indeed there, her cheek flushed, her eye flashed.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you come in?" said she.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim had no excuse to offer for having come-and he was too much confused to devise excuse had he been persuaded of the necessity-and so he said that he saw her at work as he was passing, and, as it was yet early, he came in.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Charlotte had sat down again at once to her work. Eph now dropped into the remaining chair, and drew it up to the table.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte's room was a part of her. Of all the rooms along the alley it belonged to her. There was nothing in it but the table that held her lamp, and the bed in a corner, the two chairs, and a tiny stove, that you might have carried on your hand. These were the contents of the room-but it was a different place from Philly's cellar, or Eph's own attic chamber: Ephraim was now in high life, and he felt the contrast. He took up Charlotte's work which lay upon the floor beside her. She was making, of fine colored tissue papers, fire-screens and lamp-shades, and other fanciful ornaments for shops, and illuminated rooms.</p> 
                  <p>She explained it all to Eph, and showed him the lovely effect by taking a lamp-shade and holding it over the light. And the enchanted Ephraim forgot that Philly was seeking for some woman's work-he had quite lost sight of her.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't let me hinder you," said Eph; and Charlotte thanked him, but she added, as she took up her task where she had left it the minute before-</p> 
                  <p>"This is the way a poor girl like me makes up for a little pleasure. I think I'll keep away from Tabby's now."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't go to threatening that," said Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"Why not?" asked she, with charming innocence.</p> 
                  <p>"It takes up too much time to be fooling in that way.<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6043-00000068"/> If I had stayed home I should have done my work by this time to-night."</p> 
                  <p>"If you stayed home you wouldn't ever been there,"</p> 
                  <p>"That's so; and you'd pleased the rest better than you did talk talking with me, I guess," responded she.</p> 
                  <p>Eph denied that, and said he went only as a looker-on, and overseer, to see that all was done up quietly, in order.</p> 
                  <p>"You don't always manage that," said Charlotte, working on, not looking at him. But his eyes never for a moment were removed from her. "May be you wa'n't there though, when Philly got her hurt."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said he, not quite knowing how to take these words, the lady was so serious, speaking them. "I was there. But these girls that come from the street are so devilish bold and noisy. It's more than one man can do to keep 'em in order."</p> 
                  <p>Eph uttered this slanderous implication and falsehood, looking straight at the girl's face.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte laid down her work when he had spoken it, and surveyed him as if perplexed by his words; then, having come to some conclusion, she smiled, and returned to her work without speaking.</p> 
                  <p>Though her smile said that she knew the facts of the case very well, her forbearance in not bringing the charge home upon him as she might have, gave Eph great satisfaction, and he said, in his way-</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Folks sometimes get the worst of it to pay for meddling. Philly will know better next time."</p> 
                  <p>"She did it for you," said Charlotte.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll fight my own battles; Philly knows that."</p> 
                  <p>The way in which he now spoke seemed to set the Lady's heart at rest. The effect became apparent. She did not bring herself down to his level-for there was given to her, by nature, a range that was above his-but she assured him to rise to hers. In her quietness, in her repose, she had a wonderful advantage over him. Her manners were a perfect wall of defence around her. Evil could not penetrate it-whatever her career might be, the controlling influence must come from within her nature.</p> 
                  <p>To her the boisterous Eph deferred in his heart-a crowned queen might have been his unchanging wonder-might have won his loyalty-but she would have failed to move, to influence him, as this girl did move and influence.</p> 
                  <p>While he walked cautiously upon this ground, feeling the uncertainties of the way, guided only by his impulse, and that controlling him in a manner impulse had never before controlled him, he lost sight of himself-his mighty, self-sufficient self-his vanity and courage did not sustain him. He was not a propounder nor an expounder of any law, or fact, or purpose now: nothing that concerned him had utterance of his lips. It was of herself only that he wished to hear and speak. Here was a continent to be explored<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6043-00000069"/> plored. He had touched upon the shore, and stood spell-bound, invited on by every breath and aspect, yet restrained from an advance in spite of all his courage, for this was unknown ground. He thought he heard her calling to him through the enchanted wood; but <emph>did</emph> he hear? and was there a hand beckoning him on.</p> 
                  <p>Thoughts as like these as Ephraim could think, puzzled him while in Charlotte's room, and when he went away to his own garret, and sat down opposite that picture hanging from a rafter against the wall-the picture which, to his fancy, bore so close a likeness to herself.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>When Philly returned to her cellar, the old man was there before her. He was waiting, wide awake. She sat down by the stove-needing no invitation-so far was sleep from her eyelids, and without waiting for her to speak, he said:-</p> 
                  <p>"How's the eye?"</p> 
                  <p>"I forgot about it. Well, I guess," answered Philly, looking at Abraham, and thanking him in that glance for the kindly inquiry.</p> 
                  <p>"It's that I've been a sitting here and thinking on," said he. "I was dreadful feard some harm would come to it after you went."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, no," said Philly, "no danger. I wish you'd gone to sleep, Abraham. You have to work so hard, Abraham."</p> 
                   
                  <p>Before she spoke his name the second time she paused in her speaking, and during that pause the old fellow had very nearly uttered an eloquent disclaimer to her remark about his hard working. He felt of late so young and strong-so equal to anything-he did not like to think that she looked upon him as worn out and miserable. During the past days his spirits had risen to a height they had never attained before in the course of his forty years. He was so happy and so cheerful, so contented, that he indulged no apprehensions of this mood so strange to him. Why should it not continue? Through the whole of that long evening he had sat smiling at his stove-many a time he had risen, and for a moment listened at his door-listened for footsteps and a voice; but at each fresh conviction of mistake in his hearing, he had returned to his seat with a light step and placid countenance-no heaviness there-no weariness.</p> 
                  <p>When she pronounced his name he looked at her in a startled, anxious way. She had something to say to him that by anticipation perplexed him-for evidently she was perplexed-there came one or two of those old wrinkles which had disappeared, back to his face; but he prepared himself to give to her what she had given to him, some cheerfulness. So he hitched his chair still nearer to the stove, and looked at her, and when she repeated "Abraham," he asked, with something like authority, though<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6043-00000070"/> kindlier voice was never heard speaking from age to youth-</p> 
                  <p>"Philly, what is it you're a going to say?"</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, what sort of girl be I?"</p> 
                  <p>"Goodish," answered the old fellow, half smiling, as he replied, with that word which she had formerly used in explaining herself to him.</p> 
                  <p>"Be I worse than others?" asked she, not answering his smile, apparently not observing it.</p> 
                  <p>"Wuss? What makes you think so?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't think so. But I don't know what I do think, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"There's many more in that same boat," answered he.</p> 
                  <p>"But, Abraham, be I bolder than the rest?"</p> 
                  <p>"Bolder?" said Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes; you know what I mean."</p> 
                  <p>"No, I don't; I don't know the first bit what you mean."</p> 
                  <p>"It's working in the street I expect so long. And getting in a way of talking loud. The young man upstairs don't talk so; and Charlotte don't; even you don't, Abraham. I want to do something else beside stay out in the streets. I want to be different. You know."</p> 
                  <p>"Why don't you ask Ephrim?" said he. The appeal she made to him drove the poor old fellow to his wit's end. And it was not from jealousy, nor any other unkind motive, nor from a desire to learn if his suspicions were well-grounded, but simply because he knew not what better counsel to give, that Abraham thus spoke. Yet his heart warmed, not with evil rejoicing over her trouble, but with some hope, he knew not what, when she answered-</p> 
                  <p>"I have spoke to Ephrim." For now, if Eph had failed her, did not her question prove himself her next best friend, according to her thinking?</p> 
                  <p>"What does he say?" he asked timidly; not daring to rejoice, even when he believed that there was cause.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing. I can go and learn the figger-making for all him. He don't care. But Abraham I want to do something what'll make me different."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't want you to be different. What for? I'm sure," said Abraham confusedly, expressing his opinion as it came, but not all his thoughts. That he dared not do.</p> 
                  <p>"But I must be different. I want to know what folks do. I want to think. But I can't think. I know how the ladies walk in the streets. Charlotte is as nice as any in her looks; but she has different work. She does different from me."</p> 
                  <p>"Go and ask her how she does it," said Abraham quickly.</p> 
                  <p>Philly looked at his brightening face, and her own countenance seemed to catch the reflection. His perplexity had disappeared, hers seemed about to follow.</p> 
                  <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6043-00000071"/> 
                  <p>"Go and ask her what to do," said Abraham again. "She's a woman. 'Taint Eph and I that knows."</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe I will," answered Philly, speaking more slowly, more thoughtfully, than Abraham, and with less hope than he.</p> 
                  <p>"Of course," said he, "it's the way. How does she look?"</p> 
                  <p>"Like a lady," said Philly, "that's what we call her."</p> 
                  <p>"She's the one to tell you. Go and ask her," repeated Abraham, more and more persuaded of the wisdom of his counsel.</p> 
                  <p>"It's by sewing, and making things she gets along. I seen her in the street a carrying of a box sometimes. I helped her once. She was acrossing 'mongst the wagons and carts, she dropped her box, and couldn't get at it agin, I ran in and got it out for her. The cover had flewed off: and beautiful things was in there. Them's what she makes, I expect. Look at my hands, Abraham, do you think I could do anything but sweep?"</p> 
                  <p>"Go and see her; tell her about that ere risking of your life and limb, to get her box out from under the wheels, if she don't gin you her advice!" For such features as Abraham had that was a very threatening aspect his face now wore.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-yes! she will, I expect, Abraham. I'll try her," said Philly, even as though she had him to conciliate.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Do," said Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"When?" asked he, half doubting, looking up at her after a long silence.</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow," she promised.</p> 
                  <p>"Tell her about that ere box, be sure you do that," said he. "'Taint to be expected she'd forget that."</p> 
                  <p>"She might," hesitated Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Then let her, and be darned! If she's forgot, what you do is, turn about, and quit. She can't tell you anything. But if she don't disremember, she'll likely put you in some good way, being a woman that gets a living for herself. If she can't tell you, I will. So come back to me, and don't be feared."</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, I never was feared but once. No matter about it. I'm not feared now a bit," said Philly, taking courage from the kind look of the scavenger. "There ain't nothing to be feared about, is there, Mr. Black?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," he answered slowly, but not quite with hesitation. And he looked with thoughtful eyes upon the floor, as if taking calm cognizance of all the evil there was in the world, at least of all that had come under his observation.</p> 
                  <p>"Nothing," observed Philly, "nothing but losing them you didn't expect to lose. Do you know what that is, Mr. Black?"</p> 
                  <p>"I've lost some," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"Was it ever made up?" she asked with evident great interest.</p> 
                  <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6043-00000072"/> 
                  <p>"Everything I ever lost is made up complete," answered he. He made the reply with an energy and spirit that startled himself, and made Philly smile and say from her heart-</p> 
                  <p>"I'm glad for you, Mr. Black."</p> 
                  <p>Abraham sat back in his chair contentedly, complacently, when she said this. He fell forthwith into an amiable, musing mood, which Philly did not disturb again. He seemed hardly to notice, and did not look at her, nor speak, when she left him; but, it was of a shape, and face, and voice, and being like hers, that he was thinking. For what that he had lost, was her life not a compensation? If Ephraim is far off-Abraham is near.</p> 
                  <p>If she knew it, would the knowledge be anything to her?</p> 
                  <p>Philly returned to her street-sweeping and stall-tending the next day. She worked, as she had never done before, with quickened energy of will and faculties, extorting from the hours, as they passed, more than they had ever given her.</p> 
                  <p>Late in the afternoon she went shopping. A great purchase was in her mind when she made her way among the slop-shops, and entered one where she had sometimes made purchases before, Abraham would have recognised her when she again emerged from that place of traffic in her changed attire-but he would have looked his entire admiration through his recognising eyes.</p> 
                   
                  <p>She did not return to the cellar, but stopping at a pump in the street she cleansed her face and hands, and went down the alley where Charlotte lived.</p> 
                  <p>She knew the place. The house had been pointed out to her-she had seen "the Lady" sometimes, had watched her from afar, as she entered that house-door-and toward it, directly she went. There was no hesitating here; she rapped and entered at the bidding of the tenant within, and crossing the threshold of the little room, stood looking down at the worker who sat beside the table.</p> 
                  <p>The Lady rose up in seeming astonishment. Philly's appearance, as well as her appearing, surprised her. As they stood opposite each other it was apparent that all the grace, and refinement, and goodness of the two, was not absorbed in one character; but there was no one to perceive-no one to assure Philly. She however had within her own noble soul, if not assurance, strength.- It was not of disparity between them that Philly thought now-nor of any grace of nature, or of art, in which the Lady was arrayed, was she now thinking. By one great effort, or through much painstaking, Philly would come to an expression of the purpose of her appearing there.</p> 
                  <p>She had not prepared the speech that she would make, and seemed for a moment at a loss with that quiet, inquiring gaze upon her.</p> 
                  <p>"I am Philly," said she; something she must say.<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6043-00000073"/> There was no pretence in this announcement-it was simply said. She hoped she should be recognised, and, if "the Lady" would know her at all, that was her name.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte anticipated nothing less from Philly than some charge of a jealous rival. In a contest of words what would she do with one so courageous and fiery, so quick in thought, and swift in speech, as Philly ? She entirely mistook the girl's errand, and resorted to her craft; for if Philly's doubt was great as to how this interview would be conducted, and where it would end, Charlotte's was still greater.</p> 
                  <p>There was nothing for her, there never is for a mind like hers, but resort to craft; and she said-</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Ephraim's Philly."</p> 
                  <p>"Nobody's Philly. But that is my name. Do you live here in this room?"</p> 
                  <p>The Lady bowed her answer.</p> 
                  <p>"It must be pleasant to live here," inquiringly, and yet with confidence, she then remarked; to which also Charlotte assented.</p> 
                  <p>"What I wanted to know most," said Philly, advancing at a slow pace on this ground, her voice expressing the constraint she felt, while her countenance betrayed her longing for some assurance from the Lady that her request would be favorably received, "can you make a living by your work?"</p> 
                  <p>There was no sympathy in Charlotte's face when she heard this question. She could not or did not perceive ceive that there was something deserving of attention behind this fact that a street-girl, like Philly, came in those decent garments and asked, not boldly, not confidently, nor even as friend might ask of friend, for information on this topic.</p> 
                  <p>She had forgotten that difficult way her own feet had trod before they came to this path of comparative ease and security. She had no time, no heart, no counsel, for another, and she fancied that Philly was only deceiving her. Earnest she seemed indeed, in her desire for knowledge on the subject, but it was probably to serve some other purpose than that which was most obvious.</p> 
                  <p>"I make a living," she answered, "but I'm killing myself to do it."</p> 
                  <p>"You'll die in your bed, and not drop on the stones to be run over by a cart, that's a comfort," said Philly. "I want to quit the streets, Charlotte."</p> 
                  <p>"You do," said she.</p> 
                  <p>"I want to have such a room as this, and work like you, and live like folks-that's what I want."</p> 
                  <p>"I would rather sweep the crossings."</p> 
                  <p>"No you wouldn't if you ever tried. See my hands, are they too big and coarse for such work as that? I want to learn."</p> 
                  <p>The Lady shook her head. "Not this kind," said she, "you couldn't."</p> 
                  <p>"Why?"</p> 
                  <p>"I learnt when I was small. It's took me till now<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6043-00000074"/> to get learnt. And it takes me day and night to keep a shilling between me and death. Have you got anybody to take care of you while you learn?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," answered Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Then it ain't the business for you," said Charlotte relieved, and yet evidently suspicious still. "The streets is surer."</p> 
                  <p>"Is that so ?" asked Philly seriously. "You never tried that work."</p> 
                  <p>"But it's surer, I know."</p> 
                  <p>"I'd be willing to do anything for you, if you'd show me how to make them things," said Philly, ignoring all that had been spoken, in her strong desire to learn; but she did not call to Charlotte's mind, as Abraham bade her, that service she had rendered her in the streets long ago.</p> 
                  <p>"You!" exclaimed the Lady, calmly surveying Philly while she spoke. Then she took up her work carefully, and busied herself about it. "I haven't got the time to breathe. How'd I learn you? If I go out for an hour, I've got to sit up all night to pay for it. Did you know that?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'd be willing to work just as hard. I'd be willinger than you. I'm stronger than you be: it wouldn't come so hard. I'd never be a trouble to you. I know my place: I'd keep it. You needn't quit your working to show me how; I could sit and look on." Thus did Philly plead, with eyes and voice and heart. "Things was ne'er learnt in that way. It's took me year in and year out, this ten year, to learn. You couldn't do anything with them hands now, I know. Besides, I'm going to move away from this, I expect."</p> 
                  <p>"Why didn't you tell me that before?" asked Philly, looking at Charlotte with an evident doubt of her truth.</p> 
                  <p>"Because, it was my own concern," said Charlotte, laying down her work a moment, speaking very slowly while she looked at Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"I hope it's what you'll know how to do allers, to mind those concerns of yours," said Philly turning away from the table. "I hope no one will ever ask you agin, in all your life, to help 'em. <emph>I</emph> haven't asked you as if I was a beggar. For I ain't that. And I'm sorrier for you than I be for myself." Saying that, she went away.</p> 
                  <p>When she had gone, the Lady's work dropped from her hands-for one other moment. She had at least spoken the truth in regard to the necessity of her continual labor. But while she sat and worked she meditated:-</p> 
                  <p>"She's found out what Eph likes in a girl. Maybe he's told her. That's what she wants to learn of me." Then, for her vanity was flattered by that thought, and a little kindliness toward Philly found its way through her heart-"She never could have learnt, it was best to tell her so. She couldn't<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6043-00000075"/> hold the shears to cut a point. You might as well put a cart-horse afore a carriage."</p> 
                  <p>And then, gradually, the remembrance of Philly vanished away from Charlotte's mind, and the most abiding thought her visiter had suggested was the thought of Ephraim.</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">A DOOR OPENED.</head> 
                  <p>PHILLY walked slowly home. No words of mine can express her disappointment. Hitherto, in whatever she attempted she had been successful. If it was in righting a wrong, in aiding another, in cheering and comforting a disconsolate, unhappy soul, she had failed in none of her enterprises; so she had come to regard all things as possible with her. Her hope had risen higher and higher from the moment when, like an inspiration, the thought of Charlotte, and the occupation of her life, came before her. As she went down the alley to that room she had not entertained a doubt of her success, she rejoiced already in it. How she should make her want known-that perplexed her for a moment-but she was confident of all that would follow. And nothing of that had followed!</p> 
                  <p>But, if her disappointment at the result of her endeavor was great, she allowed it no far range. She did not descend into the cellar when she had arrived at her home; went not down there seeking Abraham's consolation, nor to hide her chagrin among the shadows.</p> 
                  <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6043-00000076"/> 
                  <p>Instead, without an instant's hesitation she began to ascend the staircase that led up to the room of the image-boy. His door stood partly open as she went up, and Wilhelm heard her, and recognised her step before she came in sight. When she did come he greeted her with a smile, for he observed instantly the change in her appearance, and he liked the looks of the clean dress and comely person.</p> 
                  <p>"Come in," said he, in his frank, cordial voice.</p> 
                  <p>"Come in and see what I've done to-day."</p> 
                  <p>The cheery words, and the welcome, did what a lifetime of greetings like those of Charlotte could never have done: it pained her heart, and humiliated her, as praise humiliates genius. Did he know to whom he spoke? What was there in this voice that it should call forth her tears now, at a moment when she had felt strongest-and-saddest? But she made no account of the sadness.</p> 
                  <p>She was astonished at herself when she felt those tears gathering in her eyes, she turned with a smile that pained Wilhelm, for he saw not only it but the tears also, turned to the work he had completed this day-the fresh medallions, and little statuettes-how fair and fresh! She did not touch them with her hands: with her hands she brushed away her tears.</p> 
                  <p>"What are you thinking of?" asked he, for her tears were falling faster than she could hide.</p> 
                  <p>Philly looked at him, and shook her head.</p> 
                  <p>"Eh-what is it?" said he.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"How long was you learning?" asked Philly with a great effort, controlling herself.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, not a great while," answered he. "Here-take this plaster, put it in this mould-make it smooth, and put on the form. Let me see what you can do."</p> 
                  <p>It was now all accomplished! And by his own words! With an alacrity that told her joy, Philly obeyed him. He kept her at work thus, full an hour.</p> 
                  <p>They said little to each other in that time. Philly was anxious, careful, exact-and Wilhelm absorbed. Sometimes he sang, and sometimes he whistled at his work, and seemed utterly forgetful of her presence. But he was not forgetful. He lifted his calm eyes now and then to her face, and ever after sang a merrier strain: not that he felt himself so much better off in this world than she, but because her presence was like a ray of the sun to the heart of the lad.</p> 
                  <p>Yet he was anxious about a hundred things-by nature silent-and working with a great object weighing on his otherwise free spirit. Philly, there in the room, at work with him, seemed like an accession of strength both to his mind and body. Abraham might have said the same thing in relation to himself-and so might the old apple-woman on the sidewalk.</p> 
                  <p>Philly inspired them all.</p> 
                  <p>But she took no credit to herself for this. She never took credit to herself on any account. Until of late she had rejoiced with a pride that had something<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6043-00000077"/> thing of vanity in it, in that great physical strength of hers. It had been her glory in the eyes of her associates-especially in the eyes of Ephraim. But even he preferred the dependence and weakness of the Lady.</p> 
                  <p>From looking at her now and then, and observing the expression that predominated in her face, as she became more and more absorbed in her work, Wilhelm at length put down his tools and went off toward a shelf just under the sky-light, whereon stood a box. Its cover was secured with a key: unfastening it, he took out a small medallion, that had a pure blue ground, and white alabaster figures, and this, after a momentary inspection bestowed upon it, with a straightened figure and compressed lips and resolute aspect, he laid, without speaking, on the table before Philly.</p> 
                  <p>From it she turned her wondering eyes to him. Bewildered she looked at him. What "sweet miracle" could he not have performed? There was that in her glance of amazement and expectancy that betokened no possibility of doubt in her heart concerning him. But she said nothing. It was for him to speak.</p> 
                  <p>"Those I'll make money of," said he; "nobody makes such here. What do you think?"</p> 
                  <p>Philly's eyes could not have held a smile more than they held when she looked at Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"That's the kind," said she; and she said it with such confidence that Wilhelm's fortune, to his own mind, was as good as made.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Was it for riches you come here? Was you poor?" asked Philly, as if the thought were incredible.</p> 
                  <p>"Poor," answered he, "but comfortable. We were all moulders and modellers a long time. But then my father died, and my brother. So I took the tools and come. They said I should find gold growing on the bushes out here. Do you know where?" He smiled a rueful smile, and with a gravity not all-assumed he spoke.</p> 
                  <p>"I never saw any growing," said Philly, shaking her head.</p> 
                  <p>"It's not so very thick to be picked up either," he went on. "But keep a-working, and who knows?"</p> 
                  <p>He whistled a lively strain.</p> 
                  <p>"Keep a-working!" echoed Philly, cheerfully; and then seriously, "Do you mean me too?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-of course."</p> 
                  <p>"At this work?"</p> 
                  <p>"Anything to live by."</p> 
                  <p>"Sweeping streets?"</p> 
                  <p>He looked at her with inquiring scrutiny.</p> 
                  <p>"Anything honest to live by," he repeated.</p> 
                  <p>Then there was a pause.</p> 
                  <p>"Is your sister like me?" said Philly.</p> 
                  <p>He surveyed her from head to foot before he answered, then he said:-</p> 
                  <p>"About like you." But this was evidently not the answer readiest from his lips.</p> 
                  <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6043-00000078"/> 
                  <p>"Did she make figgers too?" asked Philly, in great hope.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. She was good at it. She's doing the same thing now. They would have come here with me-but they will be here soon."</p> 
                  <p>Philly's face became crimson hearing this. Joyously she went on-every scruple from her was now gone. If one woman could succeed in learning this art, another woman could-and she would be that other woman.</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow," said she, speaking with more confidence than she had spoken-"I'll take the board about to-morrow. I'll go every day. I'll make money at that for you. You needn't pay me nothing. I can get enough to pay the rent, and what I eat. And you see this here new dress I've got and paid for! I'll be decent to carry the board about. You'll show me how to make the figgers, and that'll be pay for me. If your sister can do it, I can."</p> 
                  <p>"You shall, then," said Wilhelm. Her words had burst from her with a force of resolution that he could not resist. Indeed, it had been a cruel or a jealous heart, like that of "the Lady" Charlotte, and such a one alone, that could resist such pleading as was underneath the straightforwardness of Philly.</p> 
                  <p>He might feel somewhat troubled, and wish that nothing of this had happened, when she was actually gone from his attic. She was not the person with whom a partnership would seem desirable. Even the sale of his wares, which he believed she might accomplish, was a questionable kind of favor. She was not like his sister. And yet, when he had told her that she was not all unlike Helen, he had not spoken falsely; and now, at this stage of his reflections, the picture and prospect began to brighten. She was, indeed, a street-sweeper, and the tenant of a cellar-a more unpromising subject than she his eyes had rarely seen, if he regarded her merely as she seemed on her first appearing-but he could not leave out of mind the change that had taken place in her since then. Since the disfigurement of her face had been removed-since she had procured the dress to which she drew his attention with such undisguised satisfaction. Since he had seen her when she looked upon that treasured secret of his art; since he had watched while she labored in that work, so beautiful to her.</p> 
                  <p>When Philly went down the stairs that night, and found Abraham walking about the cellar, she did not sit down to chat with him, according to her custom.</p> 
                  <p>As he came toward her, not intentionally, but in the course of his walk, while she closed the door behind her, she had another purpose in her mind than that which found immediate expression. He looked at her with such a welcome that she could not pass on at once to her den; she must stop and share her news-her good news-with him.</p> 
                  <p>So she waited till he came up to her, and she laid<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6043-00000079"/> her hand upon his shoulder as if to arrest him; but she knew there was no necessity-that he would stop to listen of his own will.</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, I've got something to tell you."</p> 
                  <p>"You are dressed up," said he, surveying her from head to foot.</p> 
                  <p>"How do you like my dress?" She looked down upon herself with a maiden vanity that was as satisfied as any eyes that ever looked down on brocade. She was happy as she could be. Who is happier?</p> 
                  <p>"That depends on how you got it," answered Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>There was a little flashing of fire in Philly's eyes at this, she looked at Abraham without speaking-her hand relaxed the grasp of his shoulder, and then tightened again, as if she meant to shake him; the old fellow seemed apprehensive of this, though not in the least fearful of the chastisement. But he made haste to explain his words, which he did by asking-</p> 
                  <p>"Was it Eph that give you the dress too?"</p> 
                  <p>"Eph!" exclaimed Philly, and her voice had unmistakably a scornful sound. "I bought it for myself."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" said Abraham, in a subdued tone.</p> 
                  <p>Then Philly laughed, and shook him to the tune of her laughter, and asked him if he thought she would be able to breathe if Eph did not give her the liberty to do so-at which Abraham's courage revived, and he seemed to think that if Philly did not need to be conciliated, she at least deserved to hear what he had to say by way of explanation.</p> 
                  <p>"I had rather buy it for you myself than have him doing it all for you," said he. "I'd like a chance to help you myself."</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, Abraham, but I would not have you spend your money so." In a low voice Philly, said this; she could summon no stronger for speech; he would have heard then both trembling and tears in the sound: for while Philly would have held it a small service to pass herself through the fiery furnace in behalf of another, the least deed done for her became great in the reception. To think of Abraham's desiring to buy a dress for her, when he let her sit by his stove in the evenings! "I could buy it cheap," said she, speaking now more strongly, for her whole happy fortune was recalled to her mind the next moment. "I wanted to make myself clean, for I'm going to-going to-do you want to know what I'm going to do, old Abraham?" She shook him again with that hand upon his shoulder, but more gently, as she spoke now; not with laughter as before, but looking at him with a happy, serious look, that told the blessedness and greatness of the vision opening before her eyes.</p> 
                  <p>Abraham did not at once answer her; when he did speak-she waited till he should-he said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Not if it's going to take you off from this."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh no, it won't."</p> 
                  <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6043-00000080"/> 
                  <p>"Then tell me;" and Abraham's face brightened. But that brightness was not of Philly's inspiring, though she hailed it with a greeting.</p> 
                  <p>"Figgers!" said she, looking at him expectantly, as if he were to solve the problem she propounded. But he looked at her and gave no sign.</p> 
                  <p>"A board of figgers!" she vouchsafed; her hand dropped from his shoulder, and with both arms outstretched, she seemed by her gesture to indicate that the whole world was now at her command. And still the old man gave no sign.</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham," said she, "did you hear?"</p> 
                  <p>He bowed merely.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm a going to have a board of figgers, Abraham; going to walk about the streets and sell 'em. Other days I'll be up there helping to make. When I get learnt I'll find work, you know, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>The joy of her heart ran through all these words; the last came slowly from her lips, as if so burdened with delight and triumph as to find difficulty in expression.</p> 
                  <p>"Them's um!" said Abraham, receiving the words in all their fulness, and evidently coming up to an appreciation of them.</p> 
                  <p>"I knowed what <emph>you'd</emph> say," responded Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"I knowed you'd be glad."</p> 
                  <p>"You won't be a going off, then? What if the boy up there should move?"</p> 
                  <p>"He won't," said Philly, with confidence.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"You'll go if he goes, I expect."</p> 
                  <p>"Why, no, Mr. Black, I don't see that."</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Sure?</emph>" He was looking down into her face with that manner of authority with which, but now, she had looked up to his.</p> 
                  <p>"Sure, Abraham," said she promptly. "But I'll be out sometimes a sweeping I expect. To pay the rent, you know. I'll get no pay up there yet. But I'm to learn; and that's for carrying the board around."</p> 
                  <p>Said Abraham, "Sit down."</p> 
                  <p>"Not to-night," answered Philly; and she took a step that indicated her intention to go presently to her own room.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll pay that rent of yourn," said he then, proceeding to the point directly.</p> 
                  <p>She looked at him surprised, doubtful, could he be in earnest?</p> 
                  <p>"No, you won't," she answered. "You! What for? I'm going to be beholden to no man," she continued with more energy, as if she would maintain that point against the world. "I owe Eph. I'll pay him sure's I live. I don't want no help, Abraham. So let that stand."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't be mad," said Abraham in a soft tone meant to persuade her.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll never be mad at you; but let me alone. I'm a girl that takes care of myself. That's what I've allers done: allers till I got sick. But Abraham," she turned herself fully toward him with the thought that<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6043-00000081"/> these words aroused, "if I have another fever-and I sha'n't have, but if I should-don't let Eph do anything about it. You may go off and leave me alone; but lock the door to your back, and keep him away."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll do that!" exclaimed Abraham, with wonderful readiness.</p> 
                  <p>"If I think I'll starve to death, then I'll let you know first of all," she promised-and that too satisfied him.</p> 
                  <p>Do you think that any mortal on the face of the wide earth went to rest that night with profounder satisfaction than our Philly? She had brought herself into harmony with life. The future looked promising before her-the present was full of its fair certainties-what more did she need? But that horrid den to sleep in! The earth under her feet; that damp and cold stone wall, the foundation of the house, around her-darkness, all cheerlessness. Oh! friend, what are these circumstances, conditions, phenomena? Has our Creator placed his children under the <emph>dominion</emph> of things that are temporal; of stocks, and stones, and "worse than senseless things;" or made us free of all surroundings, but the Love that feeds the raven, decks the lily, heeds the sparrow? Has Christ redeemed the world that men and women should walk through it mournfully, and call it with sighing breath, a "Vale of Tears?" Philly knew better. Her instinct taught her better; and she had the wisdom to rejoice. And Abraham's bed was soft and warm that night; he dreamed of Philly-and it was as though an angel ascending and descending ministered to him.</p> 
                  <p>I speak not of their joy that any soul may envy it, as though it were a rare, almost incredible possession. But I make mention of it that every mortal tempted to the belief that mortal joy is a dependent blessedness, might stand reproved before the face of this fact, which is not isolated in itself, but world-wide in its significance. For a good many generations the fashion has prevailed of giving large indulgence to "suffering, sad humanity," and the world, like a spoiled child, neglects its privileges, crying for-the unattainable, the useless, the unknown. Glory be to God on High for the good hope! the last poet of dirges shall presently cease wailing, and the strong voices of thanksgiving shall be heard. The sick world shall go, finally, to its physician; the risen sun of righteousness break through the exhalations of lamentation with which ungodly unbelief dares profane the purity of heaven. We shall cease to cherish the foul fallacy that makes of this life a mystery of providence, which, without the adjustments of the future, would be both "inexplicable," and "intolerable." Man shall not dare preach, woman shall not dare believe it.</p> 
                  <p>We shall understand that though most true of the Apostle's time, it is <emph>not</emph> true of ours that, "if in this life only we had hope in Christ, we were of all men<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6043-00000082"/> most miserable;" for the world has proved now, and knows, that in Christ's teaching is the fulness, the richness, and glory of all philosophy; even the JOY that none can take from the possessor.</p> 
                  <p>But Philly was no Christian, for she had never stood within a church-door, nor been taught Christianity. Was not the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world? Have not the heathen a law unto themselves?</p> 
                  <p>Sleep sound, Philly, on your earthy bed; dream on, old Abraham; let no one dare to pity you-but all the world may laugh. Verily, I wish it would, were there no mockery in it. For there is no sight on this earth so cheering, so enlivening, as a contented being-I do not say contented animal!</p> 
                  <p>There is no beauty in torpidity-small hope for sluggishness: let no one confound contentment with these. There is a life that springs from the seed of godliness and bears the fruit of faith-does it cast no pleasant shade? Does it not <emph>grow</emph> up to Heaven? And what shall hinder the freedom of its out-spreading branches? or the Holy Dove's Descent?</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE GREAT SPECULATION.</head> 
                  <p>SEVEN days the sun had set and risen. What was Philly doing? When the days were fine she was making long excursions through the streets selling Wilhelm's medallions and images; and when the days were stormy-and during the evenings-she was in Wilhelm's attic, perfecting herself in that work, "whereto she was called."</p> 
                  <p>She had seen nothing of Charlotte since she made the vain application for her assistance; she had seen nothing of Ephraim since the night when he escorted her disconsolate self from Tabby's to the cellar.</p> 
                  <p>But "the Lady" had seen Philly on one of her excursions, when she went about with the board of images; and Ephraim had seen her. Charlotte was compassionately glad that the girl had found something to do; Eph watched her from his stage-box, and imagined a scene of collision with Philly, and the consequence of a sudden demolition of her wares, and laughed as maliciously at the imagining as though it were not a positive impossibility. Those feet of hers would never slide on any of these pilgrimages. Ephraim<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6043-00000083"/> had wronged Philly in many of his thoughts of late-he had become more and more involved in his affections toward Charlotte, and his conscience, not wholly at ease concerning Philly, and the part that he had taken in respect to her, set him even more firmly against the girl.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte spoke of Philly to him the day she met her in the street, and questioned him concerning her, as though he, of all others, were prepared and furnished with all needed information. But he resented this charge as it had been a personal affront. Why should he be supposed to know about the girl? What business was it of his that he should know how she employed herself? But it was supposed-Charlotte ventured now to say-it was supposed that it did make a difference to him. They all understood it so. Upon which Eph swore some tremendous oaths. Whatever was thought or said, it was nothing to him what the girl did-and he gave way to some angry reflections subsequently-when he was driving through the streets, and when he was in the solitude of his own garret looking at the pink and white face on the wall-as though he had been wronged in some way by the bare supposition;-which was all very unfortunate for poor Ephraim, for it was certainly the best fact concerning him that he knew what he did know of Philly.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte did, it is true, appear in the capacity of peacemaker, but not till bitterness was in Eph's heart, and passion on his tongue. Her gentleness and graciousness were real when they appeared; and precious beyond price in every manifestation to the shorn Goliath; but, notwithstanding, he was thinking perpetually that he must be quite free of Philly, and puzzling his brain to know how that was to be accomplished. She must not be permitted to attach in any, the slightest degree, as a drag to his fortunes. He must just cast her off. Now there was no need of his indulging in this train of thought; it was all idle that he felt the life of Philly to be the cross to his own fortunes. There was room enough for both of them in this great world; but passion is always throwing out its arms, and complaining of suffocation: it needs more room and air than God provides for any creature's use.</p> 
                  <p>He must cast her off. He!</p> 
                  <p>Accordingly Ephraim went down to the cellar twice, with the intention of bringing matters to a crisis, as they say; but Philly was not there, neither was the old man.</p> 
                  <p>The third night he sought her, Abraham was at home-and guileless in the joy of his honest old heart, for Philly's success in her new calling, and her delight in it, was a more than individual delight to him-he was drawn out to expatiate, in the hearing of Eph, and for his sole enlightenment, on the subject of her recent and new labors.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim's mind was not open to, or capable of, Abraham's<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6043-00000084"/> ham's view of this subject. He felt some relief in hearing how much absorbed Philly was in her new occupation; he thought, besides, it was a favorable time to bring matters to a conclusion between her and himself. There might as well be a settlement at once. But in justice to him it must be said that he did not ascend the stairs with his purpose quite fixed in his mind.</p> 
                  <p>As the old man had directed him, but declining his offers of guidance, Ephraim ascended to the German youth's attic.</p> 
                  <p>At the door of that apartment the young man paused, and listened, before he tried the latch. He heard voices talking-Philly's voice, then Wilhelm's, and then the image-boy began to sing. It was a song of several verses. Eph waited on the landing while it was being sung-a sense of injury prevailing during the first moments of listening. But in the quietness compelled by that act of listening, the recollection of Charlotte came to him accompanied by a remorseless resolution. The wrong doer, not the wronged man, stood there in his person.</p> 
                  <p>He went into the room when the song ended. Philly and Wilhelm were both by the table diligently at work, and there was the wooden tray with its colored birds, medallions, and grand central figure of a knight in armor, arranged for a new venture through the streets.</p> 
                  <p>When Philly saw Ephraim coming in, in that same instant her eyes flashed from him to the laden table-not with the purpose of directing his attention thither, but to observe the effect on him. He merely followed the glance-and saw nothing more than he had seen a hundred times, and never heeded.</p> 
                  <p>"You're here, then," said he to Philly, advancing toward the table as he spoke. "What doing?"</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm looked at the gigantic intruder without speaking; perceiving that he was not a customer he went on with his work, not in any way impressed, it seemed to Philly, who was relieved by his conduct and bearing; she had been somewhat concerned herself at the entrance of Eph.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim, when he spoke, took up a bit of finished work, and looked at it.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm a-working here," said she.</p> 
                  <p>"What for?" asked Ephraim, with something of his old, authoritative manner.</p> 
                  <p>At this Wilhelm looked up quickly and surveyed the two. Ephraim fancied that he understood the meaning of that glance. His personal experience during the last few days, had given him some deeper knowledge of the human heart than he ever had before.</p> 
                  <p>"What for?" repeated Philly. "For a living. For the same thing I worked in the streets, year in and year out, so long. I told you, I must quit that, you know."</p> 
                  <p>"It's street-life yet, ain't it, when you turn out<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6043-00000085"/> there, and peddle the crockery things up and down on a board?"</p> 
                  <p>"No, it's different," said Philly quietly. "It's very different, Ephrim."</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim laughed a disagreeable short laugh, which made the image-maker look up again, quickly, at him; and which brought the blood to Philly's face, crimsoning it.</p> 
                  <p>But Eph could no more understand the real feeling that was in their minds than he could have translated a seraph's message, had one been delivered there that day. So striding up to Wilhelm he brought down his great hand heavily upon his shoulder-they were both such mere children, to his notion, as might be dealt with according to his pleasure: and his pleasure now-a-days, was to compel all things within his reach to yield to him. For a woman's sake he had grown covetous;-treasure-gifts-to lay at Charlotte's feet!</p> 
                  <p>"How much will you give me for her?" he demanded of Wilhelm. "She belongs to me, you know."</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm recoiled from the touch of Ephraim-he looked to Philly for an explanation, did not even ask it of Eph.</p> 
                  <p>Philly had both heard and comprehended. But she was struck dumb. The meaning of those words had struck through her like a flash, and hearing them she could neither speak nor move, she stood like one paralyzed, with her eyes glaring upon Eph.</p> 
                  <p>He did not understand these varied indications, but took Wilhelm's silence for deliberation, and Philly's wrath for woman-rage-a feeble thing to his mind. He had never seen but one woman whom he could not master. Philly was this sole exception, and her temper had been his plaything and sport these five years.</p> 
                  <p>"How much will you give for her?" he said again, addressing the youth. "You two seem to be getting on so first-rate. I'm willing to sell out any minute."</p> 
                  <p>All doubting, and bewilderment passed now from the face of the image-boy; he looked at Eph from head to foot, and then he looked at Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked, lifting his head proudly, and folding his arms, for he had dropped the tool he held the moment before. He was ready to give his whole attention to this speaker.</p> 
                  <p>"I want to sell out my right to marry her," said Eph, turning his back on Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"How much?" asked Philly. Taken aback by this business-like tone and aspect, and deceived by it, Ephraim paused and deliberated within himself.</p> 
                  <p>"How much?" asked Wilhelm again.</p> 
                  <p>"Five dollars," said Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll let you know, when I make up my mind."</p> 
                  <p>"It's dirt cheap."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know," deliberated the boy. "What do you sell her for?"</p> 
                  <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6043-00000086"/> 
                  <p>"For five dollars:-what for? oh! because, darn it, because she seems so well suited up here."</p> 
                  <p>"I will think about it," said the youth again, courteously, and then going to the door of the attic he opened it wide, and looked Eph's liberty to depart.</p> 
                  <p>Eph saw and understood the movement, and the look accompanying it, but he did not choose to heed it; he therefore delayed his departure, and then, sauntering through the room, examining the specimens of handicraft, again he said-</p> 
                  <p>"I'll be in maybe to-morrow, and hear what you make up your mind to: I'm in a hurry to-night."</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim!" exclaimed Philly, making a desperate effort to speak as she saw the opportunity departing. She had endeavored, but vainly, to speak before; so violently was she moved, so did she feel this insult.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim turned himself about, he was not in such haste but he could spare a moment to hear what she had to say.</p> 
                  <p>The spirit of an outraged woman was roused within her; she had never looked upon herself as a dependant upon him, and had in fact never been so except in her sickness, and he had flung her off like a weed, not to the ground, that had been nothing, but to another man for his protection.</p> 
                  <p>"Eph, you devil you, come back here-come back here!"</p> 
                  <p>She advanced toward him as she spoke, and there was an authority in her voice and gesture that he had found it difficult to withstand.</p> 
                  <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded. "Say it out. When did you ever own me, that you offer me to any man?-you coward."</p> 
                  <p>"I meant to let you off cheap," said Eph softly. Philly was Philly after all-he had no wish to hurt her feelings-he only desired, as he said, to get her off his hands, and make sure of what she owed him. When he had incurred those expenses to the saving of her life, he had never looked upon them as a debt that she must pay again; but had she not many a time assured him that to her mind it was a debt, and should be paid? And if that was the case, the money would not go to his own enrichment, but to Charlotte-of whom alone, in these days, he was thinking. So he said, "I meant to let you off cheap. You never was wise, looking after your own matters. Don't fly out,' cause I want to help you on."</p> 
                  <p>These words Philly heard as though she heard them not, when they were spoken she said-</p> 
                  <p>"Am I a decent girl, as far as you know, Ephrim?"</p> 
                  <p>"Curse the brute that says anything agin you, Philly!"</p> 
                  <p>This answer satisfied her as far as it went-but not on account of the emphasis with which it was uttered. <emph>His</emph> utterance was nothing; but he had owned the truth, and that was all she cared to elicit.</p> 
                  <p>"I owe you some money, Ephrim," she continued,<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6043-00000087"/> with a deep, tragic emphasis; every trace of anger had disappeared from both her face and voice; she was calm as hate-but hate had not calmed her voice-and firm as vengeance, though no purpose of vengeance had stirred her will "Was it five dollars, did you say?"</p> 
                  <p>"That's what I said; it's letting you off dirt-cheap, but I wanted to do well by you."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't want to be let off cheap. I'll pay you all. What did I owe it to you for, Ephrim?" she pursued this questioning as one who has a purpose to accomplish while yet he is alive.</p> 
                  <p>"You was sick-don't you remember?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I remember. And you wouldn't let me die."</p> 
                  <p>"And what I paid the money out for," said he, evidently glorying a little in the deed as he looked at Wilhelm-who, it happened, stood with his back to them, gazing down through the low window-"I had the physicker in that saved your life: and he done it. It was a life worth saving. What I thought of when you flew out so, Philly, was, I'd hurry on matters a little twixt you and this here nice young man. I know'd you'd be glad enough to pay your little debt. Just as if I was your brother, I wanted to look after you. The girl I'd knowed this five year, and never a better. That's all."</p> 
                  <p>Eph evidently was desirous of self-justification through all this speaking.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll have your money, Ephrim," answered Philly. "That's all," and then she turned herself away from him, went up to the table, took up her tool as if to go on with her work. Wilhelm did the same thing, and Ephraim, moved by her words, said in a loud voice that contrasted strangely with the deep tone in which Philly's last words were spoken-</p> 
                  <p>"Well, good-by-good-by-I ain't alarmed about the money-no hurry, you know. I was only looking out for you, as I allers have, and allers will."</p> 
                  <p>Three times, after he had disappeared, Philly walked up and down that attic chamber, pausing, with each approach to the door, that she might listen. She heard him as he clambered down the stairway, and when the sound ceased she followed after him, without looking at Wilhelm, without speaking to him. He stood where she had stood, when she was gone: as she had listened, so did he.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">MR. BLACK'S OPINION-AND THE CONSEQUENCES.</head> 
                  <p>IN the cellar sits Philly with her head upon her knees; she does not shed a tear. Nor shall the humiliation, passion, grief, she feels, find any expression. She is stunned by what has happened-whether Abraham is at home or not, she can not tell. She came in five minutes since, and threw herself upon the floor beside the stove: there she still sits.</p> 
                  <p>"Tired, Philly?" It is a question the old fellow asks when he has endured the silence and suspense as long as he deems profitable-for it is waxing late he thinks, and he was never brilliant at night, and this fact has not materially abated in its force since the brightening, the general brightening of his faculties brought about by the dawning of Philly's life upon his own.</p> 
                  <p>"No," she said after a pause, she was not tired.</p> 
                  <p>A long silence then.</p> 
                  <p>"Wouldn't she talk with him a bit, and tell him how she liked the work up-stairs, and how she was getting on, anyhow?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Not very fast," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>But she liked it just the same didn't she? or, if anything, better and better?</p> 
                  <p>She didn't know. Philly answered by sudden starts after long pauses, compelling herself to reply because she felt that his kindness deserved it, but really hardly knowing what she said.</p> 
                  <p>Of all the nights of his life, Abraham, as he sat in the cellar waiting for her according to his custom, had felt impatient for her coming. He had something to say to her that must be said. But now when an opportunity was opened for him, and seemed most favorable, for her face she kept hidden from him, and those bright eyes would not confuse his speech, and her whole manner was subdued far beyond its usual pitch and tone, now how could he speak? what say? If he feared less and less on account of Eph's probable dominion over her affections, who could tell what would come of all that work in the garret with the beautiful youth, who was so kind?</p> 
                  <p>"Philly," said he making a sudden and desperate effort, delaying no longer in the hope of smoothing the way-"Philly, two is better than one: if you think the same, say so."</p> 
                  <p>"What do you mean?" asked Philly, lifting up her head and looking at Abraham as Israel might have looked at the opening Red sea. For she saw in him already not a mortal man, but a deliverer, and she paused for no more.</p> 
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6043-00000089"/> 
                  <p>"I want you for to marry," said he, encouraged and emboldened, not embarrassed by her look.</p> 
                  <p>"To marry-who?"</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, Philly."</p> 
                  <p>"What for, Abraham?"</p> 
                  <p>"Because you're the only girl I ever wanted, and I want you," he explained.</p> 
                  <p>"What then?" she said thoughtfully.</p> 
                  <p>"We'll work together," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"How?" she asked, evidently still more interested.</p> 
                  <p>"You can go on a learning of that trade up-stairs, if you like it. And we can be comfortable anyway. I can take the care of two. Anyhow till you get learnt."</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham," said Philly quickly. Then she paused-she reconsidered: "Abraham," she began again, "I'll do it."</p> 
                  <p>She arose from the floor so speaking, and went up to him. She gave him her hand. She was a girl whose word was better than many a man's oath. And Abraham just put his arms around her, and for the first time in his life a woman's face bent over him and kissed him.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll be true to you," said Philly in a firm voice; "be true to me."</p> 
                  <p>"I will, Philly, I will," said he crying. But Philly shed no tear.</p> 
                  <p>Not she. She had to tell Abraham of that debt yet. She had told him already of it-she remembered bered. But now it was to be told again, and differently. The obligation had changed in its nature; it was not what it had been. It had once a charm about it-it had now become a galling necessity.</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham," she said, still standing by him, "p'raps you'll repent it. Maybe you'll want to take back what you've said, and if you must you must. But you shall know it aforehand. There's five dollars I owe to Ephrim. I don't know when I'll ever pay that money. And I don't know-Eph seems changed from what he used to be-he may come round bothering you about that money."</p> 
                  <p>"Never mind," said happy Abraham. You might have thought he owned a diamond mine from the way he bade her put that trouble far from her thoughts. "I'll take good care of him." How courageous his happiness did make him! He would have dared defy the whole world then, did that world set its face against his darling Philly.</p> 
                  <p>Looking at him thus-the glorious old fellow who had relieved her mind of a most distressing burden, who had restored all her courage as to the future-Philly began to waver; her stout heart which had fortified itself in the past hour, became like the heart of a child. The weapons of warfare she had held in her hands since the infant palms could grasp them, dropped now, the mask fell down from her face, she stood there in the cellar fronting Abraham a girl of<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6043-00000090"/> fifteen summers, not fifteen winters yet, a protector-a deliverer-by her side.</p> 
                  <p>Yes, he could only open for the child-the dear and only love he cherished-could only open a heavy cellar-door, and bid her welcome to a home like that to which she had been all her life accustomed. He could only bring to her the husks which even gleaners had rejected, for their bridal banquet; but joy is joy, wherever you may find it-and the God of heaven is the God of earth.</p> 
                  <p>So let white hands gather orange-flowers, and loving providence prepare the satin and the lace, the slipper, glove, and ring, and fan-bright-eyed young beauty that weds with poor old Crsus can not smile more kindly on her lord than Philly, as she turns her eyes, arch and wondering in expression, on the valiant knight who will dare to defy Eph; will not ask more innocently about the settlements than Philly, who says, questioning, yet confident-</p> 
                  <p>"How will you do it, Abraham?" for she dares not believe that what he promises is possible.</p> 
                  <p>"Do it! I'll pay the money down. What'll he want more? He shall have what's right, and after that he'll go his own ways and let you alone. I'll bet my eye on that."</p> 
                  <p>"He only wants the money," said Philly soothingly, for she saw that Abraham had made her quarrel much more his own. "That's all. He waited a long time for getting it. He was hard-up, p'raps. Never mind, Abraham." Manifestly she was in earnest, thus thrusting the subject far away from her. "But Abraham, are you sure you can afford it? Won't you be for thinking-"</p> 
                  <p>With one hand Abraham hindered her from further speaking; with the other he drew her nearer toward him. But though he tried now to speak he could not. He could give no utterance to his joy. So he desisted from the vain attempt he was making; when he could speak again he launched out on another theme, partly setting her free.</p> 
                  <p>"You won't be a-going to the sweeping agin; we'll make a clean sweep of that business. Bring me the broom."</p> 
                  <p>Philly brought it from the corner. Abraham took it, held it up in his hands, surveyed it well, then he snapped the stick, and thrust it in the stove.</p> 
                  <p>"That's what it's good for!" said he, laughing such a laugh, short and low-toned that it was, as never before broke from him.</p> 
                  <p>Philly's echo of that outbreak was quite as full of meaning. It was not merriment but the deep emotion of their joy, that was so expressed. She drew the box up nearer to the stove, and they sat down opposite each other, and with serious eyes watched the red blaze shining through the broad crack in the old iron.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you really like that business up-stairs?" asked Abraham.</p> 
                  <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6043-00000091"/> 
                  <p>"It's beautiful," Philly answered.</p> 
                  <p>"You'd like to keep to that maybe," said he; "you said you would."</p> 
                  <p>"Better than anything," she answered frankly. "If you say so," she added: "just as you say, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"Then I say, Yes," exclaimed he; all the manliness of the man roused within him. He was also in turn the dispenser of satisfaction, contentment, enjoyment.</p> 
                  <p>Sitting there, so at rest as she had never been before-alone, alone no longer-anxiety all gone-peace present, only now the tears began to gather, flowing out from Philly's heart softly, without turbulence. No grieving tears, no bitter tears were among them-but the full cloud drawn up by the sun, had proved too heavy for the atmosphere, and nothing could hinder its descent; it came down warm and grateful.</p> 
                  <p>But the falling of those tears disturbed and distressed Abraham. He looked at Philly uneasily, while she tried in vain to hide them, talking meanwhile about neither he nor she exactly knew what, essaying in his rude way to divert and comfort her; and he was getting desperate on account of his seeming ill success, when Philly rose up and gave him her hand-</p> 
                  <p>"Good night, Abraham," said she.</p> 
                  <p>He held the hand she gave him fast in his, and looked up at her wistfully-</p> 
                  <p>"You ain't repenting so quick?" he asked, and she could well see with what painful apprehensiveness.</p> 
                  <p>"Repenting! it's the best thing that ever happened to me, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"When shall it be, then?" he asked; believing indeed-but he would make all doubly sure.</p> 
                  <p>"Any time, Abraham," she answered.</p> 
                  <p>"To-morrow, then," asked he.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, if you say so: good-night."</p> 
                  <p>"Good-night, Philly."</p> 
                  <p>Abraham's eyes followed her until she had closed her door behind her, then his face dropped within his palms, and he sat peering at the black stove, smiling here and there in the midst of his reflections, as, now and then, opening upon him, they revealed the future in some new light, full of good cheer.</p> 
                  <p>He counted again the money laid away for security in the leathern rag under the stone, beneath the stove. The time toward which he had been laboring for years, was here. He knew where every cent had come from, how it had come, as he counted the silver and the pence, and laid aside, after thrice counting, the five dollars which should secure Philly's deliverance; no miser covetousness was in his heart: only deep thankfulness. Was there no compensation in this night's joy as he remembered the years of destitution through which he had grubbed? Was he not young enough to learn? And could he learn from a better than Philly, that cheerful-heartedness which<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6043-00000092"/> finds for itself an utterance upon the human face as surely acceptable to the Father as an anthem on holyday? He was young enough to learn-he was in a fair way for learning. Or, what meant that satisfaction of his countenance visible, when he counted the money? when he laid away the sum from which he had taken those five dollars? when he secured upon his person the price of Philly? Well he knew now why that treasure had been gathered, hoarded. Not for its own sake-not for his sake-for no one but herself.</p> 
                  <p>Many a mortal might call this a marriage of convenience. Assert that Philly, in her pride, refusing to be sold to youth and beauty for five dollars, did herself consent to a sale differing in no essential respect, when she accepted old Abraham. Argue that she took advantage of the old man's very obvious affection for her, and of his ignorance; and that the fact that her pride was not stung in this operation, as by the other proposition, is one not recorded to her honor. If it seems so to any reader, then it must: argument will not avail here. No soul was ever argued into a perception of the truth. Philly went to sleep happy: happier than she had been in fifteen years. And Abraham's meditations were such as never found lodgment in the breast or brain of a good-natured man, who has been imposed upon; or of one who is willing to take advantage of the desperate fortunes of another.</p> 
                   
                  <p>In the old writing-books an exercise ran thus: "All men would be happy if they knew how." I aver that this old Abraham and this girl knew how; and that both, one in her dreams and the other waking, for Abraham never slept a wink that night, looked forward to the morrow with joyful anticipations. The question of a bargain was not the fact between them. In its details the transaction had assumed a business-like aspect; but it was an arrangement that had still more to do with the heart. Abraham's disquiet was at an end. This feeling of dominion and authority of which he was now conscious, was new to him. He would have dared to stand up single-handed to a fight with Eph, should Ephraim presume to prevent the marriage. He thought of his fortune, and of all that he would do to make that young life happy-he felt like a prince, like a king, in view of what he was about to do for Philly.</p> 
                  <p>But in the attic was one still more wakeful than Abraham in the cellar. Wilhelm had recovered from the astonishment into which Ephraim's words had thrown him. But he was still thinking of them.</p> 
                  <p>When Philly went away, following in Eph's steps, he did not by one movement express a desire to follow her. He thought he would see Philly in the morning; he understood her so far at least as to trust in her. But would she come up of her own will again, and resume her labors? He thought not.<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6043-00000093"/> Wilhelm thought not as he recalled the voice that had spoken, and the eyes that had flashed in answer to Eph.</p> 
                  <p>Would he let her go then, and so be clear of her? Wilhelm was generous, chivalrous, full of sympathy; and Philly was poor and needy. Alas! and so was he! But she was a woman, and a young girl at that; and the world, as a general thing, he could but remember, deals less kindly with the daughters than she deals with the sons of toil. Philly was accustomed to hardship; she had given her promise to Ephraim that his debt should be paid; doubtless she knew a way by which she should be able to redeem that word. He had his mother and his sister to look after; she had neither glanced at him, nor spoken to him as though she anticipated help from him. If he were to spend his earnings in this way what purpose of his own should he ever accomplish? And the world so full of impostors!</p> 
                  <p>But she was not an impostor. His heart gave him an assurance that she was honest and true. His <emph>heart</emph> acquitted and justified her on every ground. Philly was no impostor.</p> 
                  <p>Thus for a time, while he went on with his work, Wilhelm argued. He arrived at no conclusion in that clash of thoughts-that conflict of sentiment. Every conclusion, so far from satisfying him, stirred him to a fresh necessity of decision, until at length, from the multitude of thoughts within him, he put down his tools and betook himself to the composure of sleep. He brought out the bed rolled up under his table-spread and smoothed it upon the floor, and threw himself down to rest, but not to sleep; no more than Abraham; but vast was the difference between them in their waking thoughts-three flights of stairs is a miserable illustration of the fact of difference.</p> 
                  <p>He could only quiet himself, and this he did at length, by promising that in the morning he would go down and discover what it was that the giant had really meant, and actually intended. And if Philly was really in his power, and if he was a tyrant, and if it was true that this money must be paid to free her, then Ephraim must be paid. For the girl must be set free. When Wilhelm had arrived at this conclusion, he sunk into a slumber that was unbroken till the daylight. Unbroken, undisturbed; no questioning parent or sister rose up in his dream to reproach him for the resolution he had made; for the generous deed he contemplated. And, as he had promised himself, Wilhelm went down in search of Philly early the next morning.</p> 
                  <p>But the cellar-door, he found, was fastened, and no answer was made to his repeated knocks and calls; after continued unsuccessful efforts he ascended to the street again, and stood there lost in disquieted reflections, looking up and down the alley; but no one near or far was to be seen, of whom he could make inquiry respecting the tenant of that cellar.</p>

                  <p>"I will pay the debt though," he said as he went up the stairs at length. "She is a good girl. It is what I would expect a man who had the money to do for Helen."</p> 
                  <p>And whether he should ever be rewarded for his trouble and self-sacrifice, was not a question in the mind of Wilhelm. It was sufficient for him at that time to have come to his generous conclusion.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE PAYMENT OF THE DEBT.</head> 
                  <p>IT was perhaps an hour later before Wilhelm heard the steps of Philly on the stair. As he listened-for he left his work at the sound and went to open his door-he heard the steps of two ascending-the voices of two-of Philly and a companion; and his face flushed with a sudden misgiving which he might not have been able to account for to either you or me, but which we doubtless can very well understand.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Black it was that came with Philly. Whatever fear or misgiving Wilhelm may have cherished for a moment, disappeared when the old man came in sight. No one suspected Abraham of anything, or was ever jealous, or afraid of him.</p> 
                  <p>So they came on together.</p> 
                  <p>Followed by Abraham Philly walked straight up to Wilhelm, her face radiant with joy, and she spread upon the table, before his inquiring eyes, a strip of paper, which she bade him read. But he could not read the language. Then Philly, with a look of affectionate pride, turned from him, to the bridegroom behind her, for Philly could not read. Already twice<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6043-00000095"/> that morning, in the house of the minister, and in their cellar she had heard that certificate, but her face was joyful and triumphant now as on the first reading.</p> 
                  <p>When Abraham had gone through the document the image-maker bowed gravely to the bridegroom and the bride, and with a partial smile; but he was slow in speaking his congratulations, all this was so sudden.</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham is going to pay Ephrim the money," said Philly, speaking out with an honorable pride, and a gladness of which she was not in the least ashamed.</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm did not say that it had been his purpose to have done the same. For two reasons it was well he did not-on his account, and on Philly's. What hindered him? Diffidence, perhaps you say-but I suppose the results involved, which were never developed, were momentous enough to justify our calling the suppression of the words, a providential interference.</p> 
                  <p>"Won't I have you up here any more then?" asked he. For Philly's smiling face was turned full upon him, she was waiting till he should speak-something he must say.</p> 
                  <p>"Just the same," she answered kindly; not knowing, far from suspecting, what there was in that kindliness for him. "Just the same, but more so. I'm to be at this work all the time, now. In the house or out, just as you say. You and Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"She likes that business," said Abraham, speaking out like a man-a lawful protector. There was nothing to restrain, or to subdue him here. Was not Philly on the side of Abraham Black! "What can she make of it?" he asked of Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"Dear knows," answered Wilhelm. "She can help me a deal. And I'll pay her for it. I needed a boy; she'll do, if she wants to come. I'll pay her as much as I'd pay anybody. She can tend the moulds and so on. And I'll carry them about the streets myself-if you both say so." He was compelled to say this, thinking in spite of her marriage-nay, on account of the marriage, for it seemed a desperate act on her part-of the chance he had neglected last night to aid her.</p> 
                  <p>"That'll do," said the old man with deep satisfaction; then he remembered himself, and asked-</p> 
                  <p>"Won't it, Philly?"</p> 
                  <p>"It'll do, Abraham," she assured him. "Things happen so strange now. There's no knowing what'll happen next."</p> 
                  <p>In those clear, untroubled eyes, there was at least no warrant of Wilhelm's suspicion and fear. He began to feel more at ease, in view of the circumstances, than he had felt. Abraham now seemed to recollect that the duty devolving on him this morning was, with the announcement in the attic, only half performed.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll go now and find Ephrim," said he to Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-do-and tell him," she answered.</p> 
                  <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6043-00000096"/> 
                  <p>"Will I show him the paper?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes! show him the paper! But don't lose it, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"You wouldn't like to go along, and tell him your own self about this little chore we've done?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," she answered, and a tone of sadness ran through the succeeding words. "I haven't got nothing to say to Ephrim now. You may tell him so, if you think's best, Mr. Black."</p> 
                  <p>"What'll I do with you then?" asked Abraham, apparently perplexed.</p> 
                  <p>Philly looked at him with questioning.</p> 
                  <p>"Will you stay up here?" he asked timidly, embarrassed by the necessity of so much of explanation as even these words conveyed. A bright broad smile flashed over Philly's face. She had indeed some one to care for her!</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-I'll go to work," she said.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Down the alley went the bridegroom-in the attic stayed the bride.</p> 
                  <p>"I ought to go to work," said Philly when Abraham was gone. But instead of taking any tool into her hand, instead of asking Wilhelm for any work, she went and stood before the low, half-windows of the attic, and looked down into the alley. She was in no mood for work indeed. And Wilhelm perceived this-but instead of abandoning his own labor he continued it, knowing that she would indulge her own idle mood with a free conscience so long as he was not infected by the same spirit.</p> 
                  <p>"How did it happen?" he asked at length. It was as much kindness as curiosity that led him to indulge her in the direction her thoughts, of their own necessity, had found. The question was likewise generously calculated to countenance her idleness. Why should she work upon her wedding-day?</p> 
                  <p>"He has thought about it this long time he says," replied Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Had you too?"</p> 
                  <p>"Not so long, quite!" Wilhelm looked at her-she was open and honest as the day. There was no regret in this admission.</p> 
                  <p>"I'm glad you are married," he said, persuaded in his heart that she had not merely sold herself on Ephraim's account-but rather that she had given herself away, and would not repent the giving.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes! so am I. He is a good man. So kind. I shall try to be a good wife to Abraham, as the man told me to, that married us."</p> 
                  <p>"I am sure you will," said Wilhelm from his heart. He was quite sure, as he had said. She would be a good wife to Abraham. How much had Abraham done for her to change the last night's darkness to this day's happy light! <emph>He</emph> might have done the same-he might have done the same. Yes-but Abraham loved her. He wanted to marry her. So she was married now. She belonged to another-<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6043-00000097"/> there was one that had a claim upon her which no other on the earth had right to dispute! Would he have had all this otherwise-even if he could? Musing the young man looked at her. For a while he did not speak, but at length he thought to say, even as he believed, "You will always make it pleasant for Abraham, I know that."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-I will," said Philly. "Ephrim used to say it was brighter down there than it was in the street the brightest day. But he found out his mistake-in good time."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm glad you are married," said Wilhelm again.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-so am I," she repeated. "He never gin me the cross word yet. We sha'n't have no quarrels, <emph>never</emph>. To think of that makes me feel rested so. I sha'n't get any more black eye now."</p> 
                  <p>"I guess not," said Wilhelm with tears in his eyes-she spoke with such touching seriousness-and her voice moved him so much.</p> 
                  <p>"I ought to go to work," said she. But still she did not move a step from the window. She merely turned round and looked at the table.</p> 
                  <p>"I've got nothing ready for you yet," said Wilhelm, bethinking himself of weddings and bridal merry-makings of which his memory was retentive-contrasting with their brightness, laughter, feasting, dancing, song, the utter barrenness of this occasion, and the constant conviction of the bride that she had already enjoyed all of the time, all of the occasion, that she had a right to enjoy.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll give you a present for your marriage," said he speaking out suddenly, inspired by his impulse. "That's what we always do at home."</p> 
                  <p>Philly stood looking at him as he turned quickly toward the box upon the shelf with that swiftly conceived and expressed thought. She watched him while he unfastened the little box, but it was past belief when he took out two medallions-the Night and Morning-blue ground-alabaster face-and brought them to her, and said, "These are for your room to hang up on the wall."</p> 
                  <p>From them to Wilhelm's face, and from that face to them, Philly looked, astonished, grateful, beyond language delighted. She did not say it was too great a gift for him to make, for her to receive-that the cellar wall was no place for such hangings. She was not even profuse in thanks, but Wilhelm looking upon her did not question her appreciation, nor repent him of the gift-but said, rubbing his hands together in a pleased, satisfied way-"I knew you would like them. Don't forget the giver."</p> 
                  <p>"I never in all my life forgot anything that made me happy," said she. "Mr. Black will like 'em too, and thank you. They are so beautiful."</p> 
                  <p>And now, though he had no said he had no work for her to do to-day, the conviction of habit that she must be at work prevailed over his disinclination to furnish<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6043-00000098"/> her with the opportunity, and Philly went back to the table.</p> 
                  <p>"Give me something to do," said she, "I must help Abraham"-and then Wilhelm seemed all at once to discover an occupation for her hands; and gave tools and directions to her, enough to last all the day.</p> 
                  <p>So Philly began life again.</p> 
                  <p>Mr. Black, in search of Eph, was a spectacle. In various places where he imagined the young man might be found, Abraham sought him-but in vain.</p> 
                  <p>But at length going down the alley he saw Ephraim entering a house; before its window Abraham beheld him standing, when, a few moments after, he passed by.</p> 
                  <p>At the door of that room knocked Mr. Black. It was opened by the Lady-a stranger to the bridegroom.</p> 
                  <p>"Is Ephrim in?" asked Abraham mildly.</p> 
                  <p>Mildly, I repeat-though he had gone out with so brave and bold a purpose, resolutely determined to retrieve his honor; for he felt the offence against Philly to be a double wrong upon himself. No one would ever have suspected the defiant mood he cherished and encouraged, while walking about in search of Eph; least of all, did "the Lady" he addressed.</p> 
                  <p>She barely answered, if at all. But a sufficient reply was given in the way she flung wide open the door, which revealed the entire room to Abraham's eyes; and by the window still stood Ephraim. He stepped forward toward the door as the old man, holding on to his hat with both hands, his little body, not straightened up to its full height, but inclining to the opposite direction, moved across the threshold, with a slight hesitation, which would have taken the form of a sudden fit of coughing, had he been less honestly timid, but he was too really concerned and moved by his mission, and his doubts as to its event, to be able to bluff off the manifestation.</p> 
                  <p>"Well, Abraham," said Eph, not at all in his usual loud, blustering way, but quite gently, "What do you want of me?"</p> 
                  <p>This manner of address, instead of disconcerting Abraham, as it might have done, so unlike anything he would be likely to anticipate was it, calmed him almost instantly. He could get on with anything short of a blusterer. His sensitive physical man took instant fright at noise, sound, and commotion-for though he had lived in the midst of it, his own life had passed in silence. When at times he lifted his eyes to see what was going on in the external world of jostle, and riot, and hurry, it was almost with the wonderment and the vagueness of apprehension with which children wait the panorama's revelations.</p> 
                  <p>Instead of answering Ephraim, he lifted his hand and beckoned, and at the same time stepped backward into the entry.</p> 
                  <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6043-00000099"/> 
                  <p>But Ephraim did not choose to understand.</p> 
                  <p>"I've got a little business to settle, if you please," said Abraham then. To this announcement Ephraim, glancing significantly at Charlotte, said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! come in, let's hear. What is it?"</p> 
                  <p>At that the old man came forward. He stood as erect now as when he went with Philly searching for a minister.</p> 
                  <p>"It's about what you was saying to Philly last night I come to see you."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, yes!" said Ephraim surveying the old man in his own way. "What then?"</p> 
                  <p>"What was the sum you wanted?"</p> 
                  <p>"Wanted for what?" asked the Lady looking from one man to the other, and speaking as though she had a right to know.</p> 
                  <p>"For what she owed me," said Ephraim explaining-he said it as if her question found its full answer in these words. "I said five dollars." This statement was made with an emphasis and look that said he was willing to stand by that claim against the world, or any mortal in it, who was so great a fool as to imagine otherwise.</p> 
                  <p>The old man made no reply. But he drew out from his pocket a quantity of silver.</p> 
                  <p>"Five dollars," he murmured, in a voice entirely distinct however, and, advancing still nearer to Ephraim, he began to count the money.</p> 
                  <p>"Come here," said he to Charlotte, and "the Lady," curious, came. He wanted her for a witness-simple, old fellow.</p> 
                  <p>They counted the money from palm to palm, three times over. Then Ephraim poured the silver treasure into Charlotte's hand, and plunging both his own deep into his pockets, as though he had nothing to do with it, and intended to have nothing, he seemed disposed to question Abraham in the matter.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is Philly?"</p> 
                  <p>"Home," said the old man, grown now very laconic, in purpose as well as speech; his manner, still more than his voice, said for him that his business there was at an end, and he began to back out of the room.</p> 
                  <p>"But how came you to have anything to do with it?" persisted Ephraim, whose curiosity rose with Abraham's apparent indisposition to make any further revelation.</p> 
                  <p>"Ne'er a better right had any man," answered Abraham, his heart swelling with pride; and with that quick uplifting of his head he looked, like a freeman, at the face of his questioner.</p> 
                  <p>"What's that to mean?" asked Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"It means she's my wife, Philly is," exclaimed Abraham, "and I'm the man to take care of her".</p> 
                  <p>Eph whistled a long, shrill note through his teeth, looked at the Lady, and would have laughed, but there was something further that he wished to learn-a moment more and Abraham would be gone-and<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6043-00000100"/> so without the merriment he followed the bridegroom toward the door, quite at his leisure it seemed.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, you have bought her then!" he said with a sneer.</p> 
                  <p>The words arrested Abraham's departing progress as a shot whizzing past him might have done.</p> 
                  <p>"Bought her!" laughed Charlotte, and that brought on the climax of Abraham's exasperation. "Five dollars! that's cheap-too cheap!" and she laughed again, and turned the silver pieces from one hand to the other.</p> 
                  <p>"I've paid an honest debt," said Abraham; "if you're an honest man and told the truth about it. You stood by her when she had the fever, and you paid her way. That's what you asked for doing it: I've paid you. Don't be saying agin that I bought my wife-or-or-" no words were adequate-no threat seemed equal to the occasion. Abraham's passion got the better of him; he had lost control of himself, and tremulous he hurried from the room, and went tottering, rather than running down the street. Ephraim and Charlotte returned merrily from watching him-it was such a capital joke. Ha! ha!</p>

               <div type="chapter"> 
                   
                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE WAGES OF SIN.</head> 
                  <p>"SO she's married," said the Lady as she sat down again at the table to her work.</p> 
                  <p>"A reg'lar innocent," remarked Ephraim joining, but not heartily, in the laugh.</p> 
                  <p>"An old trump," she suggested; and she held out her hand to young Goliath that he should take the money he had given her.</p> 
                  <p>But instead of heeding the act, or rather because he did heed it, Ephraim walked off to the window, looked out, and then again toward her.</p> 
                  <p>"Take it," said she, and her palm was still outstretched, bearing the heap of coin.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't what belongs to me belong to you?" asked he steadying himself against the window-frame, and endeavoring to conceal the agitation with which he propounded that great question.</p> 
                  <p>"Does it?" she asked.</p> 
                  <p>She was deceiving him, and he knew it not-but he would even have chosen to be deceived by anything so beautiful as she was in his eyes, rather than<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6043-00000101"/> live in the clear persuasion that to her he was nothing. She was deceiving him, because she would have had it appear that his money was nothing to her-she hoarded and prized those offerings he brought-for his sake, do you think? Possibly she told him so, and he believed that she spoke the truth; but she hoarded it and prized it for its own sake, as though she were an Hebrew of the Hebrews.</p> 
                  <p>To Ephraim, money that came so easily as this had no value. He was barbarian so far as to set a low value and price on things that cost him nothing. He did not for his part look at the money as valuable, or eminently worthy as a gift. But Charlotte knew exactly the worth of five dollars. He would have estimated higher the riband that he selected and bought her for a shilling, than the whole handful of silver; but she understood quite well that with the money she could buy not one, but forty, such ribands!</p> 
                  <p>"Does it?" she asked, in answer to his question.</p> 
                  <p>"Does it?" he asked her in turn, his strong voice more urgent, more earnest, than hers.</p> 
                  <p>"I suppose so," she answered, speaking carelessly. But that was not a careless glance she cast on Ephraim. She was pondering a great question while she spoke and glanced. As she was able, she was reading him; and halting, while she read, between two opinions, momentous to her and to him.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim looked at her as if he would fain read her entire meaning, but he was far too short-sighted for that. What did he suspect? there was suspicion-or fear of a suspicion in his exclamation-</p> 
                  <p>"The girl that cheats me!"-There he stopped, he could not utter a threat, or a doubt, in that hearing.</p> 
                  <p>"What of her?" said Charlotte, concealing well the real concern with which she asked the question.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim had mastered himself; was shamed by her coolness, and vexed at his own thought's betrayal. He did not answer, but a dejected expression flitted over his great features, as if he were aware of, and deplored, but could not resist that sort of bondage which held him against his pleasure. His combativeness, generally active, was sunken into a strange somnolency-as always when in her presence. It was strange that she should have this powerful control over him. No-he loved her.</p> 
                  <p>"She gin you the slip, and you're thinking all woman-folks must be like her." She looked up from her work thus speaking, not in an open, honest way, but slyly, cunningly, from the corners of her eyes-those eyes so beautiful to him-so beautiful and dear.</p> 
                  <p>"Who?" asked Eph, choosing not to understand.</p> 
                  <p>"You know. Philly, to be sure."</p> 
                  <p>"Put up your work," said he, coaxingly. "I've gin you as much money as you'd make in a week-enough sight more. Rest you a bit."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm better off working," said she.</p> 
                  <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6043-00000102"/> 
                  <p>Then Ephraim, dropping that argument, went back to Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"Give me the slip"-said he-"what's that?"</p> 
                  <p>"Married another fellow."</p> 
                  <p>"Did I want her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Everybody said so. You know best."</p> 
                  <p>"Everybody lied. I didn't want her. How many times have I told you that same thing?"</p> 
                  <p>"You might go farther, and fare worse," was her comment.</p> 
                  <p>"I ain't a-going no further than I've gone," exclaimed Eph, in a loud, strong voice.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte kept her eyes on her work, she was silent.</p> 
                  <p>There was so much meaning concentrated in the voice, and in those few words of Ephraim, that she had not the courage to look up. She had subdued a giant-that she felt; he was glorious in her sight, and that she also felt. She only feared him because she was deceiving him.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't want no girl but you," he went on to say. "I never did. Philly is good enough. But she was never nothing to me. I speak the truth. You was-and you be. I've attended you now, off and on, a good many weeks. What do you think about it?"</p> 
                  <p>"Think," said she; there was that in her voice and look which she intended as a satisfaction; but he wanted to hear her words as well.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you willing to go in search of a priest with me as Philly did with that old codger, Abraham?"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, there's no hurry about that!" said Charlotte slowly, biting the thread with which she sewed, and beginning to work again.</p> 
                  <p>"There is," said he, with impassioned decision. "Give me a promise, or something. I'm all off my moorings. You've never gin me promise, or word, yet. It's time you did."</p> 
                  <p>"What sort of word?" said she.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim was tormented by this way of holding him, she had. Her coolness alarmed him. He took her hand that held her work, "Look up," said he; pleading and command both were in his voice. "It's time to stop work when I want an answer."</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want me to say?" asked she in real or feigned alarm.</p> 
                  <p>"I want you to say yes."</p> 
                  <p>"It's not much of a word to say. Easy enough. Yes. What for though, Eph?"</p> 
                  <p>"To marry me."</p> 
                  <p>"I'll think of that."</p> 
                  <p>"Think of it! What have you been doing all this time?"</p> 
                  <p>"Working."</p> 
                  <p>"Curse your coolness! You'll do up your thinking now, this very day, of a sudden. Yes-or no-this very minute."</p> 
                  <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6043-00000103"/> 
                  <p>"No, then. I won't be driv'. Here's your five dollars."</p> 
                  <p>"Let 'em rot! Did you say no?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes."</p> 
                  <p>"You never meant it."</p> 
                  <p>She bowed her answer.</p> 
                  <p>Whether Ephraim would now have resorted to entreaties, or complaints, or commands, seemed doubtful-his countenance would have borne out either expression-but before he could speak a knock at the door stayed him. He looked at Charlotte, doubting what he should do; but she did not look at him, she was still bending over her work, apparently unmoved by his violent speaking.</p> 
                  <p>Quietly she said, "Come in." And Eph walked away to the window.</p> 
                  <p>There came into the room at that bidding a small man-a man not larger than Abraham, but one who, unlike him, was not accustomed to creep along the pavements, and get out of everybody's way. He walked into the room with an important air, head up, hat on, covered with gloss from the sole of his shoes to the crown of his bald head-and under his arm he carried a scroll.</p> 
                  <p>Up to the Lady's work-table he went gliding, direct, and without perceiving that the room had another occupant, said:-</p> 
                  <p>"I was coming this way, and brought your work for you, to save you a walk. You've got pretty comfortable quarters here."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Charlotte, in her usual gentle way. But Eph started to hear her. He thought that it was <emph>not</emph> her usual tone.</p> 
                  <p>"Here's a present for you. You did up the last work for us so nice. We mean to do the fair thing by you. If you ain't in comfortable quarters here, just let me know."</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you, sir," said Charlotte, in the same voice, but again it startled Eph. He turned from the window hastily, and looked at the two; just then the merchant for the first time perceived him, and stared at him while he went on unconcernedly repeating his words, and assurances; receiving again those thanks of voice and eyes, and then presently he went out.</p> 
                  <p>"Who's that man?" asked Eph, advancing from the window, the instant the door closed behind him; speaking in a voice full of authority-but his soul was full of fear.</p> 
                  <p>"The man I work for," answered Charlotte quietly.</p> 
                  <p>"What did he bring you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Look and see, if you're curious, Eph."</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim, insensible to the tone in which this was spoken, too furiously jealous to heed anything but the satisfaction of his fear-tore open the package, and throwing the wrapping aside, held up a fine red shawl.</p> 
                  <p>"That is pretty," said she, coolly looking at it.</p> 
                  <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6043-00000104"/> 
                  <p>He crushed it in his hand, and threw it down upon the table. She took up the shawl and folded it again in its own proper folds.</p> 
                  <p>Oh! as she did so, how Ephraim feared and trembled, before the smoothness of this handsome face-so fearful of treachery at the hands of her whose love he doted on!</p> 
                  <p>"What are you going to do with it?" asked he, when he could keep silence no longer. It was but a moment since she had spoken-but he could not compute the time.</p> 
                  <p>"What do women do with shawls?" asked she.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll wear it to his shop, I reckon."</p> 
                  <p>"Like as not."</p> 
                  <p>"If you want money you'll let him know as he told you, I s'pose."</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe."</p> 
                  <p>"Once for all! what do you mean? Do you belong to me or not?"</p> 
                  <p>"I should think not."</p> 
                  <p>"Who to?"</p> 
                  <p>"Myself."</p> 
                  <p>With a rapid movement the tantalized lover swept his great hand over his massive face. His face that betrayed to her, if she would see it, all the excitement, and fear, and agitation, under which he was laboring.</p> 
                  <p>She did not understand all these fears under which he was laboring-but enough of them-and every moment she was fastening new chains upon him. She did not understand him, for, brute though he was, his claim on humanity might have been substantiated in many ways hers could not been. Over much of the lion and the tiger in him, perhaps-but in her too much of the serpent, too little of the dove.</p> 
                  <p>Her answer had a certain greatness to Eph's hearing. He liked to hear her say that she belonged to herself; and never suspected that there was more pride in her words than in her impulse saying them. And besides, he felt that the ground he was treading was, after all, not so uncertain as he feared.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know how it is," said he, speaking with deliberation, for he began to see the advantage she had over him by her coolness, and he was determined to confess himself wholly to her-and appeal to her mercy if he could win her in no other way. He remembered Philly's kindness, and, in his extremity, was glad to take her for the type of all womankind. "I don't know how it is-maybe you do. Ever since I seen you I haven't been the same man. I'm thinking on you allers. You seem to foller me about."</p> 
                  <p>"I never follered any man," said she abruptly, as in proud disdain.</p> 
                  <p>"I know," said he, deprecatingly, appealingly, afraid of this unlooked-for manifestation. "It's what I've felt. I mean as if you was with me allers. Constantly. And I've loved to think it was so.<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6043-00000105"/> That pictur on my wall is like having you there-a'most-not quite, Charlotte. It done me good. But I can't tell you how-I'm feared. Don't you know it? Can't you feel it? If you was to put me off and take to deceiving me, I don't know that I'd-do as they do sometimes in the play. But I'd never believe in woman more. I'll work for you-I will. I'll never stop working. I can make lots of money when I set about it. You shall live comfortable allers. I want you. You're are the only creetur on earth I do want. I never knew what truth was, if I ain't speaking of it now. You've growed on me since I first see you, till I think of you all day, and all night. I want to be set to rest. You have only got a word to say. It ain't but a little word. But I wouldn't be having you say it, if you didn't mean it. Only do mean it, if you can. And say it, quick-there's no word could be said like that to me." He went on after an instant's pause, as if fearing to drop the argument, and hear her answer. "I know it would make me all over new. I expect to make a good deal of money. I'm a working my way up. I'll do everything for you that I can do. I'll-I'll-" here at last he stopped. He could say no more-and the Lady, who had not been unmoved by the increasing solemnity of his appeal, said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Eph you make too much of it. But I'll say yes-to satisfy you. Now go to work. Go home. I'm tired. It won't be this year that we're married-so don't talk about it. No matter about Philly. What she did. We ain't driv as she was. You haven't got any debts of mine to pay. So now be quiet."</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte's eyes were lifted toward Ephraim, who, during her gracious speech had drawn ever nearer to her. He was satisfied-satisfied with what she looked, and what she said. He would reject no evidence, not the lightest, that she loved him. She could understand that he was satisfied-but of the emotion that swept his features, as a musician's hand the harp-strings, of that she knew nothing, for of it she felt nothing.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll do as you bid," said he brokenly. "It shall be as you say. I won't bother you. But you're mine. It's true! Say it again! once more. Think how I've waited to hear it. Oh!"</p> 
                  <p>"I'll say it again," said she. She felt it was not much to say. She was more worthless in her own eyes at that moment than she could ever be in his. For though as she could love, she loved Ephraim-mightier passions than such love as she could feel, had been stirred in her nature-ambition-cupidity. If no temptations came she might be true to him-but alas for the hope built on such foundation! She even now wished that Ephraim was not so much in earnest. Calm and cold as she had seemed through all his speaking, his words had dismayed as well as amazed her.</p> 
                  <p>"Give me your hand on it," said he.</p> 
                  <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6043-00000106"/> 
                  <p>She gave her hand to him at once. He held it as one who has looked for a death-warrant, holds the pardon that sets him at liberty-he held the hand as if he would never again release it.</p> 
                  <p>But it was his life that was in her keeping-not hers that was in his. It was he, not she, whom love had blinded. The passion that had made him captive had power to work in him as it would. But Charlotte's love for him had been disturbed. Not long ago it was the great possession, coveted beyond all others; but now, when it was secured, its value was depreciated; not by the security of possession, but by the sudden opening of a prospect more alluring, which, far off, and yet within her range of vision, shone.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim's weight upon the scales told the story of his almost incredible strength. He could have crushed the life of that frail being to whose keeping he had given his peace, could have crushed the life from her with a solitary stroke; as the fly perishes under the tramp of the steam-engine, so might she have perished in the breath of his anger; but how potent, how sacred, was she in his eyes! His thoughts turned to her evermore while he pursued his daily ways, as the eyes of the devotee seek the praying machines. That he, with all his great physical power, became so weak as even to hang tremulously on her words, is a fact whose exposure should not subject him to, but secure him from, the scorn of fellow-mortals. He loved much.</p> 
                   
                  <p>As to Charlotte-think upon her case with careful consideration. Philly could not have stood in her place, or acted her part. She might have been staggered by the force of that temptation which assaulted the Lady-but never, never would have fallen before it. <emph>Might</emph> have been staggered by it. Prosperity has a great charm to poverty. A cheerful home, secure from all the encroachments of want, from hunger, and nakedness, and cold, is, to the senses deprived of these provisions of comfort, like fairy land to childhood. Who of us never coveted Aladdin's wonderful lamp? The hand that should open a way of deliverance, and the voice that should speak an invitation from the dreariness and uncertainty of want, might have been mistaken, even by the integrity and purity of Philly, for the hand of benefaction, and for the voice of benediction. She might have been ensnared and destroyed to all human judgment, as thousands of the innocent and pure have been disabled (for this life's noblest uses-not for eternity's), but her fall would not have been like that which threatened Charlotte. For the fortune which seemed opening to <emph>her</emph>, if she accepted it, there was no repentance; from its degradation no recovery. For the portion of this world's goods it was, that allured her. She was wavering between surrendering and sacrificing a life she really loved, for the vain show that glittered before her eyes. Alas for her! Poor, weak, vain, pretty-and doomed to a life of labor!<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6043-00000107"/> But, as for Ephraim's rival-let him go his way-prosperously. Is there no millstone fastened to his neck? A million curses follow him.</p> 
                  <p>Ah, gods of this world, crown him with your gifts! Give wealth and honor to him-place by the side of Dives at the feasts-and the smiles of radiant women! Deprive him of no good that you can give. Wherefore should <emph>you</emph> frustrate his ambition, or stint the measure of reward? He asks nothing of the future, nothing of the unseen, nothing of the Infinite, NOTHING OF THE PRESENT THAT THE PRESENT HAS TO GIVE; before you only he bows down-Oh, gods of this world, keep not back your benediction! Bless him as you alone can bless. The man is worthy of you.</p>

                  <head type="sub">A GOSPEL OF LIFE.</head> 
                  <p>IN the attic and the cellar life went on smoothly and well. The body and the spirit had their daily food. The present was happiness to Abraham and Philly. They rejoiced in the hours as they came and went-it was good to breathe through this new social atmosphere-good to see the sun-to go out to labors, and come back again to rest. But the tenants of attic and cellar did not live solely in the present. In the future they saw the promises, not all fulfilled in the present-answered incompleteness.</p> 
                  <p>Day after day Abraham Black went out, according to his custom, to the street-his old iron hook in his hand. The husband's step was lighter than the solitary, friendless bachelor's used to be-his face was enlivened with his heart's delight.</p> 
                  <p>Day after day Philly went up to Wilhelm's attic, and worked there in the labors she loved. On all dark days, when he could not hawk his wares in the streets, the German youth was with her in her work-and there were few thoughts cherished by either of them in secret. If Wilhelm's mind was beyond the sea in his old home, he spoke to her of all the scenes with which his heart was so familiar. He<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6043-00000108"/> could have desired no better sympathy and encouragement in his labor than Philly gave to him-nor more generous and ready co-operation, than she manifested in all his designs. And she was not merely a listener-she had her own thoughts to utter-something very often to say about Abraham, of what he had done, or was doing, or would do. Pleasant was the sound of her voice to the ear of the lad. And Mr. Black, as day by day went on, became as much the object of his veneration as he was of Philly's. How the respect and love of Philly fell on the scavenger's heart! What flowers sprung up and bloomed under that heavenly influence! Abraham's time had come at last. In pure, sweet, calm satisfaction, no man on earth was richer than he. Philly, in her home, brought honor on the name and offices of woman.</p> 
                  <p>Sometimes Wilhelm would come down from his attic in the evening, and visit in the cellar with Abraham and Philly. Sometimes they went up to the attic to hold domestic conference, or engage in social diversions there. Philly, had long deserted Tabby's and no solicitations could draw her back again. Those plaster casts which lovers of high art might possibly afford to disdain-as great people sometimes disdain smaller, forgetful of Adam-had a refining influence upon her strong character, wonderful to note. She needed now none of Eph's commendations, nor the applause at Tabby's, nor even the inspiration of those pictures of the stage. Her lover and her work filled her thoughts and her affections; she needed nothing more on earth. Ah, if I could induce any dissatisfied soul to believe that! But the most of us are waiting, with such melancholy hope, "for something to turn up!" SOMETHING which, almost beyond peradventure will turn out NOTHING in the end. We have contracted such a fatal habit, through the past generations, SINCE Christ's coming, even as before it, alas! of nursing our griefs and troubles to keep them alive, when we do so, and can do so, only by cheating ourselves out of all provision for the free children, choosing rather to maintain the bond! always the ingrate, always malformations. Philly was above that.</p> 
                  <p>The world will not hold its breath for the hearing of this truth. It did not when the Deliverer prayed that his joy might be fulfilled in the souls of the delivered. It thought perhaps that was a prayer not likely to be answered!</p> 
                  <p>If any one is looking for great workings of either Wilhelm or Philly-let him pause here at this page. I like not to occasion so shallow a disappointment as his must be. I have not chosen sombre colors, that the contrast of termination may be brilliant. Neither Wilhelm nor Philly have the endowments of genius wherewith to work miracles. They have not the knowledge that aspires to eminence-they can not perceive that anything besides their moderate desires are within their attainment. They must pass through many a cycle before they will behold the Glory of the Father, and THANK HIM FOR HIS GLORY, as the<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6043-00000109"/> clear intelligence can do. They have no genius to be delivered, else a deliverer doubtless would, at this stage of their career, become apparent. GIOTTO, drawing on the rock while his flock grazed near by, was seen of CIMABUE. There was an ear for JENNY LIND-an eye for RACHEL. Did the ear and eye hearken and see by accident? If any son of God, heir of ages, ever lived without expression of his best self <emph>in some form</emph>, the world and circumstances shall not be arraigned for judgment. But to him shall it doubtless be said, "Thou wicked and unprofitable servant!"</p> 
                  <p>They lived an ordinary human life-unpolluted by vice-poor, contented. An old theme, truly, this same story of existence; but greatly glorious and worthy of sustaining. If any were but willing to receive life merely as LIFE; making the best of it-enlarging so the borders of the heavenly kingdom!</p> 
                  <p>It is a notable fact, however, and worthy of the new generation's thought, that seats in the parquette have risen and are rising in the estimation of the people, while the tiers and boxes are not sought, as once, and the price put upon the parquette consequently rises. And let it be observed that prices are graduated, in this instance, by the positive value of the thing! It will one day be ascertained, by another class of persons than such as live to eat and drink and call their lands after their name, that life is a positive gift, worth the having, using, keeping-the keeping, since Death is but an opened corridor. The keeping-since the present stands commissioned to bestow, of its fulness, on whosoever will receive, all things richly. Imagination brings no promise for the future that exceeds those gifts the present has in keeping for such as can receive them. The preacher shall not preach for ever that "All is vanity under the sun," as he might do before that advent which all the churches celebrate-and holy men will refrain, as from arraigning their Creator, from mourning and bewailing "such a world as this." The time is coming-it shall come. And every pure and willing heart, every rejoicing spirit, is a hastener of the day. While the souls that sit in sack-cloth, bewailing personal losses, and individual griefs, clamorous for "consolation," are like heathen worshippers of gods who may be distant on a journey; surely not believers, whatever be their creed and their profession, in a present God. The doctrines that pander to the "luxury of woe," to sighs and tears, and an exemption from diligent human serving, are false as those which would incite to this day's sensuality, because to-morrow you may die.</p> 
                  <p>But the teachers, for the most part, have not yet saved Daniel in the lion's den-rescued the three heroes from the fiery trial-nor brought Israel through the Sea, and Wilderness, and River, into the Promised Land. And the humiliation of the manger, the agony of the mountain, overshadow the descending of the Holy Ghost! The darkness comprehends not.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE FIRE-AND THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT.</head> 
                  <p>ONE day that happened in the alley which sometimes happens in avenues of houses built of stone and iron, a fire broke out among those old dilapidated buildings, and in its sweep it took the house in whose attic lived Wilhelm, in whose cellar dwelt Philly. The whole row of buildings was consumed. And it was in the night.</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm was wakened by no alarming voice or hand, but by the suffocating smoke that compassed him, and by the roar of flames. He never knew how he escaped. Nor did Philly and Abraham, when, searching the next morning among the ruins if they might discover some trace of him, they found him in the place where he had crept for safety.</p> 
                  <p>Bruised, burnt, maimed, they found him. Led on by Philly, Abraham had crossed the smouldering ruin once occupied by the building; long had they searched and vainly, but that was a search she would never have abandoned willingly; she sought for Wilhelm as she would have done for Abraham-or-for Eph:-amidst piles of broken brick, and burning timber ber, they found him at last, senseless; black with smoke; wounded; bleeding.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Abraham!" exclaimed Philly, for it was she, pioneer of the search, that discovered him; no words followed this agonized outbreak, but she lifted the youth in her arms, and held him, while Abraham hurried up to her aid.</p> 
                  <p>"Water!" cried Abraham; "the pump!" and with instant comprehension, Philly started with the burden in her arms across the ruin. Abraham now assisting her.</p> 
                  <p>At the pump in the alley they cleansed his face from the blackening smoke-but still he gave no indication of returning consciousness. There was now a crowd of idle, curious, excited people, gathering round, busy with offers and suggestions; none of them did Philly hear. As she sat upon the platform of the pump holding that head-bathing its forehead-silent herself, as if dumb, she only of the talking crowd, Abraham, who shared with her in her grief, and thought no hard thought, but felt only the naturalness of her sorrow, and entered into it with all sympathy, Abraham came nearer than the others came, and said:-</p> 
                  <p>"We must take him to the hospital, Philly. We've got no place."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm ready," said Philly, and she instantly was ready to assist in the removal. There were others who would have fain borne their part of the burden,<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6043-00000111"/> but none except Abraham and herself should care for Wilhelm; and so the two together went on to the hospital.</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm did not perish of his wounds and exposure. He walked out of the hospital's gate one bright morning, leaning on Abraham's arm, and Philly was by his side. Many weeks had passed away, since they carried him in, helpless. It was now in the spring, when he again came forth, and it was the Sabbath-day. They went down the silent street, the sun was shining on them all, and though they spoke in subdued tones, all was so still around them, in their hearts they were joyous and thankful.</p> 
                  <p>They were going to the little room above ground, in which Abraham and Philly had lived since the fire. Wilhelm's broken arm was now growing strong again, his wounds were healed. But, he was troubled in his soul-he alone was sad. This trouble and sadness he did not permit to escape him by any word. He had in mind the watchful care with which Philly, day after day, had watched to hear of his recovery-never allowing the sun to rise and set without coming to tell him of her fortune, and to ask after his.</p> 
                  <p>Very impatient had she been during the past week, waiting till the day should come when the physician would allow the patient to pass from his hands. So eager to bring him to that new home of theirs, that home made beautiful by the medallions hanging on the wall-which, her sole possession and treasure, she had saved from the fire.</p> 
                  <p>To this room, this home, they-Mr. Black and Mrs.-were conveying Wilhelm; there he was to live with them until he should be able to go to work again for himself.</p> 
                  <p>But, cheerful, happy, as Philly and Abraham were over this prospect, it was not, as I said, joyous to Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>Thought of his mother and his sister had made the days of his helplessness inexpressibly wearisome; and when the satisfaction he had shared with his friends disappeared, and he was no longer able to reflect the brightness of Philly's smiles, he began to give utterance to many troubled thoughts, which were heavier than he could bear alone.</p> 
                  <p>There was a little fire kindled in the old stove, which Abraham, unaided, had saved from the ruins-the precious old stove! Philly had lighted it before they set out for Wilhelm, for within doors it was colder than without, and by their window they got no sunbeam ever. Before this venerable and revered stove Wilhelm was placed in an old easy-chair, which Abraham bought for his wife not long ago. There he sat and listened, while Philly told him in detail of what she had been doing since the fire; there he sat and looked-at her, at Abraham, at the cold bright sky seen through the window, at the comfortable stove-at the medallions shining out from the old,<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6043-00000112"/> broken and discolored wall, desponding and sad. His eyes were on those medallions when he said, not concealing his sense of the loss, but tearfully and troubled he spoke-</p> 
                  <p>"I have lost my tools."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" said Philly, "such a loss!" and she folded her hands upon her knee, and looked up seriously at him from the box on which she sat close by Abraham. And Abraham's face also was full of sympathy.</p> 
                  <p>Then Wilhelm stretched out his right arm and moved it slowly to and fro.</p> 
                  <p>"Stiff yet," said he, and he shook his head doubtfully, and, but for Philly, it had been hopelessly.</p> 
                  <p>"But it'll be limberer-the man said so-pretty quick, if you're careful." Philly who was startled by what she saw in his face, was swift to come with this assuring promise.</p> 
                  <p>Instead of answering, Wilhelm was more concerned to hide the emotion that was shaking his soul. But that he could not hide-his tears began to fall; fast they fell, and faster, until he hid his face in his hands, and abandoned himself to the storm which had risen beyond his control.</p> 
                  <p>"It will," said Philly, "it will, truly. Won't it, Abraham?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, for sure," chimed in Mr. Black. But Wilhelm heard his comforters as though he heard them not.</p> 
                  <p>"And I've got something to tell you now. I have truly. Will you hear?" Philly only paused a second for some response, and as that did not come, she went on, nothing dismayed, "I've got a place I work in; I went to a man that makes the figgers, and he had lost his boy that helped him. Abraham went with me. So I showed him what I could do, and he liked it; and you're to go and take my place, just as soon as ever you are ready. And the man don't know how to make the blue-and-white ones-I've tried him on it-and I've looked about in the other places: they don't, none of 'em, know how! So that's what you'll do. And the man has got lots of tools, and just as soon as you'll be ready he will take you in, sure's my name is Philly."</p> 
                  <p>Her voice which had been troubled and low at first rose higher and higher, as she spoke these sustaining words, till, at the close of her speech, it was evident Philly's own fears, of whatever character, were all gone. Before she had finished speaking Wilhelm had lifted his head, and his face was bare before her. Sad even to severity it was.</p> 
                  <p>"There's my mother and sister," he said. As if to remind her of what she seemed to have forgotten; it was for their sake that he had taken his misfortunes so much to heart-not for his own. Why did she not of herself perceive the fact?</p> 
                  <p>"Yes! I know it," she said; how marvellously rich in comfort that voice! how it rose and fell in its appreciation of his sorrow and trial-in its hope of<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6043-00000113"/> his triumph. "But you'll get the more work and pay. It won't be so very much longer. Abraham and I are going to help you-ain't we, Abraham?"</p> 
                  <p>"We be."</p> 
                  <p>"So you mustn't complain. It'll all be the same. You'll have to stay here and keep it comfortable for us when we come home, till you're well yourself-and then you'll see."</p> 
                  <p>The affair was now all talked over, each point discussed, so far as the present necessity demanded, and now Wilhelm must be amused and comforted. He could not have been in better hands.</p> 
                  <p>According to Philly's prophecy, which was nothing more than an expression of her will as to what should be done, it was but a short time before Wilhelm's arm was capable of entering upon its labors. There was a small room, next to theirs, rented for him by Abraham Black, which he occupied; and when he was able to return to his work Philly went with him to the workshop of her employer and introduced him there. And there they worked together, as they had worked before.</p> 
                  <p>Not a prediction that she had made but was fulfilled.</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm was more skilful than his master; and that new device in medallion-making, of which he possessed the secret, opened upon the employer's vision like a mine of wealth. He and Wilhelm had the same fatherland, and came from the same region; the bond that united them became a strong one therefore; and a bright prospect of bettered fortune smoothed away the fears and calmed the heart of Wilhelm-so that even after the first day of his service in the employ of this man, he had the courage to write home to his mother, on one page all the misfortunes he had suffered, and on another all the anticipations he dared entertain.</p> 
                  <p>Let us also turn another page. What are these characters? some dark, some light-and some, to skeptic-eyes, not quite intelligible. Yet all is surely well.</p> 
                  <p>Old Abraham lost twenty years not long ago-but he found them again-they all fell on him with their weight again. He had grown young so fast-but now he grew old faster. Not for any trouble's sake-not for any returned or new care, or tribulation. Philly did not fail him, but life did. He had lived out his day-she had merely brightened all its closing months and hours. The fire did more evil work for him than it did for Wilhelm, though there was no instant evidence given; he never saw a strong day after it. But he had never complained through all his career, and he uttered now no complaining. It was no time to begin now, though that which made life glorious had so recently come within his reach. He would not heed the warnings nature gave him, but kept on in his labor-it was all for Philly's sake. He should be better-it was not worth while to trouble<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6043-00000114"/> ble her, dear child! Was Philly blind? or, was there no indication given of his departing strength, his failing powers? The indications were but slight, not such as would seem likely to arrest her thoughts and attention. But sometimes, Philly, looking at him with strange, sharp, startled scrutiny, would say: "Abraham, you are sick," but he never allowed that it was so. Why should he disturb her-or alarm her? So it was only a little cold he had taken-or perhaps he may have been overdone; or, indulging in a little pleasantry, he was certain that she was getting old and could not see, for he was certainly unchanged.</p> 
                  <p>But, very often it was, in spite of all these assurances, Philly would say to Wilhelm, or to her heart, "I am so feared and worried about Mr. Black. He looks changed, and he acts changed. If it wa'n't for his word, I wouldn't think he could git about so spry as he does." If it was to Wilhelm that she said it, he would manage in some way to divert her attention from the subject without expressing his opinion very freely; but his own eyes were sure to fix on Abraham more seriously afterward, and he seemed to find some confirmation of her fears in his pale, wrinkled countenance, in the increasing feebleness of the old man's slender frame, and in his almost constant hacking cough.</p> 
                  <p>To neither of them was there any real assurance or confidence given in the fact, that Abraham, apparently divining the fears felt for him, came out, now and then, with some expression of his intentions as affecting ing and concerning the distant future; or with the utterance of hopes of cheerful heartedness, satisfaction, in all things concerning him, or with some clear and concise statement as to his personal feelings of strength and capability.</p> 
                  <p>The very look accompanying these expressions said to rightly-interpreting observation: "Will you believe this-will you make yourself happy in it, Philly?" For the old man's heart was anxious for the peace of his young wife, and when the truth should make itself known to her at length-then he had other words to speak to her and Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>One evening Philly had gone out to make some little purchase, which he allowed her, after a good deal of solicitation, to make for him. He had been poorly all day-had not gone out to his work. More than once the same thing had been true of him during the past weeks.</p> 
                  <p>When Philly had gone out Abraham said, in a quick, eager voice, not natural to him, which betrayed the anxiety with which he had waited for this opportunity:-</p> 
                  <p>"If it wasn't for her I shouldn't be so worried. But it's to think of her."</p> 
                  <p>"What is that?" asked Wilhelm, quickly; by his voice he was greatly startled as if with some sudden fear; or, as with the conviction that certain secret fears were about to receive their confirmation.</p> 
                  <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6043-00000115"/> 
                  <p>"She can take care of herself as well as anybody I know. I'll leave her all I've got-but she'll be alone-she's fond of me. It'll grieve her-I know it will." Abraham said this as if in soliloquy, but his eyes were all the while fixed anxiously on Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"What will grieve her? Who is going to leave her?" asked the youth again.</p> 
                  <p>"When I'm off," said Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"Off where?"</p> 
                  <p>"Dead," answered he, making a painful effort to speak courageously, and even cheerfully.</p> 
                  <p>"Dead-what would you die for?" Nothing but this could Wilhelm think to say.</p> 
                  <p>"Ay! what but 'cause I've had my notice to quit. Plenty of notices. But it'll be sudden like. All the better. But I thought to stay longer. Young man, you see her, what she is. How happy she can make us-how happy she's made me, and this here room. What'll you be doing, sir, when I'm gone?"</p> 
                  <p>"Working, I expect," answered Wilhelm. "But you are not so bad. You will be better. This is nothing."</p> 
                  <p>"There's been days," said the old man, with solemnity, and with a conviction that rebuked the encouraging words of Wilhelm. "There's been days when I didn't know but I'd fall down dead on the sidewalk; but I'd drag myself back here, and she'd make me all over again-it seemed so-with her talk and pleasant ant face-and fun. I'd a been dead afore this long enough, but it's she has kept me alive. She's worth living for-but I haven't nothing to say. It's more than I'd ever expected to have a girl of my own at all-and such a girl as she is!" He paused musing, and then started up quickly, from a meditation very pleasant to him, by the softening of his voice and features it was surely so-and he said, anxiously, "I've got another little chore to do, afore I go. It's to ask you why wont you look after her, Wilhelm?"</p> 
                  <p>"I will," was the instant answer-"I will, Abraham, I owe that to her and more-more than I can ever pay!"</p> 
                  <p>"Marry her!" exclaimed Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>But to that Wilhelm was silent. It seemed to be amazement that prevented his speech.</p> 
                  <p>"You don't like that," said Abraham, evidently disappointed.</p> 
                  <p>"Mr. Black," answered Wilhelm, "there ain't another girl on this earth like your Philly."</p> 
                  <p>"I know it. That's the reason I wanted you to have her. The very reason," said Abraham, slowly, despondingly-as he looked on the young fellow's face, it did not seem that he would argue the point further; but his disappointment was manifestly great.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't forget," said Wilhelm, speaking with difficulty, "I don't forget what she has done, how she's looked after me and kept my courage up-I never can pay her."</p> 
                  <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6043-00000116"/> 
                  <p>Here old Abraham interrupted him:-</p> 
                  <p>"It isn't the pay I'm talking about. You don't owe her nothing but good feelings. You owe her them-more'n you could pay, or I could, or anybody. I ain't making a bargain. If you don't want her, you sha'n't have her-I say that, I'd say that anywhere. It ain't many men I'd speak to in this here way. Nobody that I knows on but you. And now I haven't spoke-I take it all back-every word-do you hear? I haven't said nothing. Not a word."</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham," said Wilhelm, in a voice that was meant to pacify him, and the voice or the words had that instant effect, for Abraham's heart was an easy one to reach,-"Abraham, it sounded strange what you said-you a living man, and talking that way to me."</p> 
                  <p>"Could I talk if I was dead? and I shall be dead afore long-any time, who knows? It's what I wanted to say-what I've wanted to say. And now I've said it. But it's as if I hadn't told ne'er a word to any, I won't be kept to it," and, speaking so, Abraham turned his face toward the wall, away from the serious eyes that fixed upon him, now without embarrassment, without wavering, with solemn determination.</p> 
                  <p>"Will she take me, Abraham?" asked the youth.</p> 
                  <p>Quickly the old man turned to Wilhelm, his face was glowing with his hope:-a moment's scrutiny of the face steadfastly turned toward his:-</p> 
                   
                  <p>"That's enough, boy," said he, "that shake in your voice sounds right. You needn't give me any promises. I'm easy in my mind now. All's right. Go off now, will you-a minute-maybe."-</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm, without speaking, turned away from the bed; but he had not gone half across the room when Abraham called to him:-</p> 
                  <p>"Come here."</p> 
                  <p>And again he was obedient.</p> 
                  <p>"Think now," said Abraham, "have I done right by her allers?"</p> 
                  <p>"You have," said Wilhelm, promptly.</p> 
                  <p>"But think," urged Abraham, not quite satisfied with the immediateness of the response.</p> 
                  <p>"I know," said Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"Thank you. That was 'cause I loved her. Would you do the same? To go away and leave her-that's the worst of all. I aint afeard for nothing else. And I aint afeard for that, for you'll look after her."</p> 
                  <p>"I will," promised Wilhelm, solemnly.</p> 
                  <p>"You'll love her?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I will."</p> 
                  <p>"You do, maybe."</p> 
                  <p>"I do."</p> 
                  <p>"That's all. I'd get well if I could. But it will never be-I knew it since the fire. But I've give her away. Only may I speak to her about it?"</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm did not for an instant deliberate.</p> 
                  <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6043-00000117"/> 
                  <p>"Speak," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"Perhaps I will," said Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>It was dark when Philly came in. Abraham had sunk into a slumber. Wilhelm was watching in the room till she should return. It was a new position for any one to occupy in Abraham's behalf-no one had suspected his need of a watcher. Even Philly, thoughtful though she was, and thoughtful of him continually, did not think of him as <emph>requiring</emph>, moment by moment, a watcher.</p> 
                  <p>"Something for Wilhelm," said Philly, as she opened the door and saw him standing by that window, which, on the brightest days, gave no glimpse of the sky, and now only the confused outlines of roofs and chimneys.</p> 
                  <p>The voice of her who came drew Wilhelm from the window, he went toward Philly, and, without speaking, took from her hands the letter she extended to him, and Philly hurried to bring a light.</p> 
                  <p>"A letter from home," said Wilhelm. Philly smiled to hear him, thinking of the rich, deep fulness of meaning in these words-of Wilhelm's present and coming delight. She did not see that anxiety which he could not all conceal; nor hear in his words anything but gladness. She brought the light near to him while he stood to read the letter, would have held it for him but he took it into his own hand, and she still continued standing there to share the good tidings with him, as he should be willing to communicate. No act could better illustrate the simplicity and guilelessness of her own heart. It was thus that Abraham saw them standing when he wakened from the light slumber into which he had fallen. A moment he looked at them in silence, then his eyes caught the letter, and the sense of loss that swept over him was gone.</p> 
                  <p>"Who've you heerd from?" he asked.</p> 
                  <p>Twice Wilhelm had gone through the letter, and had not stirred, nor looked at Philly, nor spoken a word; now he gave her the candle, and went toward Abraham-</p> 
                  <p>"From home," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"What news?" asked the old man, with an unusual eagerness, almost with apprehensiveness it seemed.</p> 
                  <p>"Good news," answered Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"What is't?"</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm hesitated. Philly also, as well as himself, had drawn near Abraham's bed; she leaned against it, and smoothed away the hair from Abraham's forehead, and kissed that forehead as she did not often, but her heart was full of tenderness tonight-joy and sorrow both were subduing it-she was so glad for Wilhelm, and so concerned for Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>"Why don't you tell it out?" asked the sick man, it almost seemed with asperity, for the young man's<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6043-00000118"/> hesitation alarmed him. It might be that Wilhelm already repented the promise he had given.</p> 
                  <p>"My sister is married," said he then, but still with hesitation.</p> 
                  <p>"And coming!" exclaimed Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"No."</p> 
                  <p>"What then?" asked Abraham sharply.</p> 
                  <p>"Not coming at all; but they want me back."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" said Philly joyfully, and yet with regret.</p> 
                  <p>"She's well off, then?" said the old man.</p> 
                  <p>"Rich," almost sighed Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"What do they say?" asked Abraham; or, rather demanded he, as a man having authority might do.</p> 
                  <p>"To come back and live with them, all together again," answered Wilhelm, hesitating, as if confessing some wrong he had wrought.</p> 
                  <p>"That would be so pleasant," said Philly-she who had Abraham, did she not <emph>know</emph> it would indeed be pleasant could he return to his own! Still in the saying was a sigh. It was something to lose Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>Whether Wilhelm caught that tone I can not say, but now he stepped up close to Abraham Black's bedside, and for his advance, even Philly must stand aside. There was something between these two, of which she knew nothing-something that had been said, and something to be spoken.</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, shall I go?" asked he.</p> 
                  <p>But Abraham did not answer.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Then there was another pause, so momentous, so full of meaning, even to Philly's observation, though not to her comprehension, that she restrained herself from speaking; had she spoken it would have been to say-</p> 
                  <p>"Go back to your mother," but she was still.</p> 
                  <p>Then said Wilhelm, tremulously-</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham, tell Philly why I can not go back to my own land. Why I can never go; never."</p> 
                  <p>"There's ne'er a reason why," said Abraham quickly, turning toward him; but his eyes were full of hopeful light, in spite of his words.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes. There is. My home is here. Remember what you said, Abraham."</p> 
                  <p>"I-I said nothing. You'll go back to your home, and riches; of course you will."</p> 
                  <p>"Never till you drive me."</p> 
                  <p>"Comfort and riches," mused the old man gravely, "they be great things-great things for old or young."</p> 
                  <p>"It's comfort and riches to stay here," said Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>"Bring the candle!" Abraham said this turning quickly toward Philly.</p> 
                  <p>She brought the light.</p> 
                  <p>"Hold it up so I can see you both. Hold it quiet, Philly. Let me see his face." Wondering, Philly obeyed him. "Wife," said Abraham, "have I been kind to you? Have I treated you allers the best I knowed how? Have I made you pretty comfortable, dear?"</p> 
                  <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6043-00000119"/> 
                  <p>"Oh, Abraham!" cried Philly, startled and alarmed by his words, "you've done everything." Abraham grasped her hand, he placed it in the hand of Wilhelm, which he also held.</p> 
                  <p>"I want to keep a-doing it for allers-everything," said he. "But I'm going off. What'll I do then? Nothing. I've got to do it afore I go. Here's Wilhelm: he's young-he's strong-he'll do the same thing; but better-same trade; good and kind. He ain't a-going back to the old country. It's for you that he won't, Philly. You're better for him than mother, or sister, or fortin. Isn't that enough for you to hear to-day? I'm going off. He knows all about it. But you won't forget old Abraham-no you won't do that, Philly. He won't ask that. I'll leave you all my money. You'll work to one trade. I'm glad. It's all right. Both of you hears. It's my doing-it's all right."</p> 
                  <p>Having said these words Abraham looked at them and smiled-his look was full of benediction. Full of satisfaction. He was ready now for anything that might come upon him-quite prepared. His "little chore" was well performed, and Philly safe.</p> 
                  <p>What did those hearers? The young wife crept upon the bed, and laid her head on Abraham's pillow, and wept in those old arms that encircled her so tenderly.</p> 
                  <p>Wilhelm walked away-to the stove-to the window, and finally out from the room.</p> 
                   
                  <p>What he went for was a doctor.</p> 
                  <p>A doctor he found, and brought home with him; but the man of medicine knew no method of vitalizing that worn-out frame of Abraham's-its life was dying-and he said so on that first and only attendance; for there was no occasion here for restoring, or even preserving hope. Abraham must die.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">WALKING IN SLIPPERY PLACES.</head> 
                  <p>THERE are times in the life of a hard-hearted, prosperous sinner, who has given himself over to the world, flesh, or devil, to a strife in their behalf in which he must inevitably be vanquished, for SHALL he not go out of the world naked as he entered it? there are times when the very greatness of his success staggers, astounds him. He knows not what to do with his superabounding luck. In the course of time he becomes accustomed to this sort of novelty, and takes precautions to build his barns large enough for his harvests.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte, "the Lady," was not yet beyond the point of surprise. Now and then Ephraim astonished her by his lavish gifts; by the eloquence of speech in which he expressed himself. And though neither words nor gifts were ever rejected, though both had their own peculiar charm and value to her, she was becoming less and less certain of herself in the reception, though more sure of him in the acceptance. She contemplated no great wrong to Ephraim, deliberately-no wrong! She admired him, and liked him better ter than any other person on earth-man, woman, or child; but, since the merchant's gift of the red shawl, and the words to which afterward it led, she had never been quite certain of herself, nor felt at ease in view of the reliance with which her lover relied on her.</p> 
                  <p>She did not feel so certain of herself as he evidently felt. She had enough of ease and comfort in the world to be allured by the prospect of greater. And the merchant .... But it was rarely that she allowed herself to carry out that thought, imagination, or desire, to its full extent.</p> 
                  <p>She had the large, unselfish, courageous heart of Ephraim, at her disposal. What more did she want or need? But there was constantly a voice, not Ephraim's voice, calling her out amid far other scenes than those in which she mingled. Was it indeed a voice-or a fancy of her own? Could her woman heart not hear, though no words were in her ear? If the merchant.... Wo to Eph if the merchant ever uttered with his lips what his eyes said, what the shawl, and not that only, but the dress, the bonnet, rings, gloves, said to her.</p> 
                  <p>It astonished Charlotte when, from time to time, nay, even constantly, Ephraim proved his knowledge of her wishes, by his anticipation of them in such manner as he could anticipate them. How carelessly soever those wishes may have been expressed-he remembered them. He treasured the recollection.<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6043-00000121"/> He worked with but one motive in the world-he had but one study, it had reference to all his working-that he might make Charlotte happy.</p> 
                  <p>More and more as she, in view of the merchant's words and acts, became suspicious of her own constancy, for she had a perpetual apprehension of the time when that constancy should be put to the trial, she became afraid of Eph.</p> 
                  <p>She betrayed all the weakness of the coward in the guilty inconstancy of her heart.</p> 
                  <p>All transformations, all transfigurations, are indeed within the power of love. But I have erred in giving for a moment that dignifying name to Charlotte's sentiment. She never loved Ephraim as he deserved to be loved. And she could not love him so, because within the range of things, was that she valued higher. Something better than love for a woman's heart! The merchant had that in his keeping.</p> 
                  <p>Strangely had he changed, this giant, young Goliath, with his frequent coming to that chamber where the quiet girl went on through daily life with perpetual daily toil. In his manners, his voice, his look, his whole aspect, his habits-in all these he was changed. The "old man" was quieted, subdued <choice>
                        <sic>in in</sic>
                        <corr>in</corr>
                     </choice> him-none need tremble before him now-he had a gentler speech, a gentler sympathy-his heart was warmed throughout.</p> 
                  <p>And yet, incapable as he was of actual suspicion of her truth, though he adored the girl, Ephraim never felt quite at his ease, secure, happy, with her. No reiteration of assurances could bring him with perfect freedom to her presence. He always came doubting his reception, though not in the acknowledgment, even to himself, of such a doubt. He always left her more a captive than he had been before. And never thought to wish that all this might be different with him. If he was disquieted, restless, fearful, it was himself he blamed, not her. He was impatient of poverty, and all his worldly circumstances, on her account, not his own. If ever disagreement rose between them in after reflection he put upon himself all blame, and blushingly acquitted her. For Eph's ideal was not what it once was. She was his ideal.</p> 
                  <p>One night Ephraim went to Charlotte with a gift which he had purchased for her. At last had purchased! for to secure it he had toiled through many a day. It was an ornament of gold and colored stones, which had attracted Charlotte's notice as it blazed from a shop-window one night when they passed by. When she expressed her admiration of it, and stopped to gaze at the glittering trifle, Ephraim vowed in his heart that it should be hers.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte's surprise was real when Ephraim, unfolding the tissue wrappages, laid the bauble before her. She was unfeignedly astonished that he should have procured so costly a proof of his devotion to her. For gifts like this she did not look to him.</p> 
                  <p>Whatever earnestness and sincerity there might<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6043-00000122"/> once have been in such expressions of regret as she now made, the sincerity was at least as now expressed, unfeigned. True, she had admired-true she had coveted. But very recently, yesterday perhaps, some one had talked to her of bracelets and brooches, ear-rings, and finger-rings; bonnets, veils, shawls, and silks; a fine room-nothing to do-maybe a carriage; and had asked her, Would she have it all? These things were hers for the taking!</p> 
                  <p>And so, Ephraim's gift came late. Ephraim's gift, vast in the comparison, vast for him to make, was nevertheless, small.</p> 
                  <p>But-this gift was not "without the giver."</p> 
                  <p>How tremulous was Ephraim's voice when he spoke! It never trembled so in the days when he came with his trifling, but prized, offerings, to Philly! How his hand trembled too, when he removed the wrappings, how it shook, that great brawny hand, when it extended to her the delicate offering to vanity. How he blushed and stammered, the stalwart fellow, thinking she would wear it-because he had at last, by denying himself in every way, managed to purchase it for her!</p> 
                  <p>"It's too much for me," said the Lady. Her cheek paled speaking this. This was no play. So terribly earnest was Eph in his devotion.</p> 
                  <p>But Ephraim laughed at her words. How proud that laugh and look-that she should attach such great value to his gift! In truth it was a costly affair fair; he was willing to admit that; but it was none too good for her.</p> 
                  <p>He said so.</p> 
                  <p>"There's nothing too good for you, Charlotte. I'm a strong fellow; who knows-maybe them that walks afoot shall ride some day. Maybe some that ben't so very fine now, shall be dressed like any that shines some day. There's a good many carriages in the world to be bought, and a good many people waiting to ride; a good deal of money, if you could get at it-and here's a pair of hands, for sure, that'll have their share some day. Here!" and with his great hands Eph fastened the brooch on Charlotte's bosom. He who performed that feat of daring was equal to any deed of valor. He stood off and surveyed the picture to which he had added the completing stroke by this act-contemplated it admiringly:-</p> 
                  <p>"Don't take it off. Wear it allers," said he, for her hand raised as if to remove the pin.</p> 
                  <p>At his word the hand dropped-the brooch remained secure in its place.</p> 
                  <p>But, though Charlotte smiled, as she obeyed Eph's word, still she looked at him and around her, and then at her work, with a nervous apprehension that would fain have found a more explicit utterance.</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim in his speaking had not commanded, but humbly entreated her. She dared not, could not withstand him. This mood of his, which was now become habitual, she could not manage as those other<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6043-00000123"/> moods, when jealousy and uncertainty in respect to his own position in regard to her, troubled him. His commands she would have set at naught; his request she would not have heeded; but in his entreaty was something which she dared not deny.</p> 
                  <p>"Wear it, for my sake, won't you?" that entreaty ran.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," she said; but her voice had gentler tones than those used here. But that word satisfied him.</p> 
                  <p>Though, even in her saying of that little word, spoken so promptly, so openly, said with eyes drooping, so that he could not discern their expression, there was something heard by the listening heart of Eph, that made him question her sincerity of purpose. His doubt might have risen from a consciousness that he was all unworthy to receive so great a good as he had here-from the timorousness of his passion-but it did arise, from whatever cause, and only to trouble him.</p> 
                  <p>Nevertheless, as the evening wore away, and he sat in the light of the flashing jewel, and the shining gold, listening to the sweet voice of the Lady, as she sang this and that, the favorites of all the songs he liked, the spirits of Ephraim rose high. Fast the evening went; so that, but for her glance, which arrested him in the midst of his rejoicing, he could not have been convinced that the hour had struck. After this hour she must be left alone. He always departed with its coming; but now, while they both heard and counted, and said "How soon!" he looked expectant, for some other word that should invite him to remain. But no such word was spoken, and so Ephraim arose, and kissed her, and spoke some gentle farewell word, and went away.</p> 
                  <p>It was not half an hour later when the little merchant, glossed from head to foot, shining in his polish, crossed the same threshold over which the dreaming Ephraim passed out.</p> 
                  <p>Wonderful power of adaptation which Charlotte possessed! If she was quiet in Ephraim's presence, and subdued him, she was quick-witted and gay before the new-comer, and fairly enchanted him.</p> 
                  <p>But when she first heard his footstep, announcing his approach, a sudden new sense of the game that she was playing seemed to possess her. Uncertain, perplexed she seemed-agitated, now relenting, now cruel. When the merchant had entered there were no traces of these doubts upon her quiet face. She had taken off the breast-pin, and was looking at it; she seemed however disposed to put it out of sight as he came; but then, becoming suddenly very bold, and reckless, as her fair face indicated, but not to the eyes of the man that entered-he, as well as Eph, saw only pink and white, and the black eyes, and long black hair-a fair face only, she made as though she would hide the ornament she held; he saw; but perceived not all of her intent.</p> 
                  <p>"What have you there?" asked he, with a different<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6043-00000124"/> ent kind of authority from Eph's, but still quite as commanding, as urgent; more difficult to escape; for the merchant was a rich man in the goods of this world.</p> 
                  <p>"A pretty thing," said she, indifferently. But he held his hand out for it. It was not such a trifle as to be unworthy a nearer look. The merchant, too, could be jealous.</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte had trained herself-in her range she was faultless. When he held his hand to take the trinket she hesitated long enough for him to demand it of her, in, as she fancied, an imperial manner. Then she gave it him.</p> 
                  <p>And when he asked, "Where did you get this?" she was silent till he repeated the question.</p> 
                  <p>"It was left here," she then replied.</p> 
                  <p>"It's going to be left here too," he commented, with a disdainful toss of the ornament.</p> 
                  <p>It fell to the floor-poor Ephraim!</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte picked it up, and held it in her hand, and if without indignation, there was that in her manner that hurried the visiter into an explanation of his words.</p> 
                  <p>"My carriage will be here for us presently. Are you ready to move?</p> 
                  <p>"So soon," said Charlotte, her consternation was not all assumed; but the carriage! oh, a vehicle rolling upon wheels and drawn by horses is such a marvellous affair! Charlotte, poor "Lady," could not walk fast enough down to her destruction-she too must ride!</p> 
                  <p>"So soon!" the man laughed. "How long a notice do you need?" asked he. "Have you so much to do before you can move? Don't trouble yourself. There's nothing I want out of the room but yourself. The rest you can leave behind for whoever comes after-brooch and all."</p> 
                  <p>There was nothing assumed or feigned in this speech, at least. Charlotte looked around her while he was speaking. There was in truth little to leave; but she had passed many years in that room-it was home to her.</p> 
                  <p>"Pooh!" continued the merchant, after waiting a moment for an answer, which did not come, "you're not making count of what this stuff is worth, are you? Wait a day. It will be time enough to take an inventory then."</p> 
                  <p>"No," said Charlotte in a lamentable tone of melancholy. "I've lived here a good while, though."</p> 
                  <p>"And high time you changed your quarters-another year here would make a finish of you. You are going to live now."</p> 
                  <p>"Haven't I been living?" she asked innocently.</p> 
                  <p>"You shall tell me in a day or two what you think about that," said the merchant, quite content to wait till she should make her after conclusions in regard to that point.</p> 
                  <p>"I know," said Charlotte, taking up the brooch and<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6043-00000125"/> looking at it, not as if it absorbed her, though her eyes were fixed on it intently, "this stuff has been worth something to me, but of course it ain't worth nothing, either. I'll leave it as you say, of course. But this-let me take this. Not to wear; of course not. And I don't care much about it. Only, I must take it."</p> 
                  <p>"You must?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I must."</p> 
                  <p>"I say, you must not. Who gave it to you?"</p> 
                  <p>"Ephraim did."</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ever hear that a fool and his money are soon parted?"</p> 
                  <p>"I want to take it."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't intend you shall."</p> 
                  <p>Charlotte looked up with a quick, angry gesture; but the merchant met her with a smile of infinite good nature, that was fairly puzzled to know if she could indeed be earnest in her foolishness. She blushed before that glance-her hand relaxed its hold on Ephraim's gift-she laid it on the table. At that moment the sound of carriage-wheels was heard-nearer and nearer the sound, then a sudden ceasing of the rattle.</p> 
                  <p>"Come," said the glistening merchant. He started up. Without a word Charlotte also rose-without a word put on her shawl and bonnet-and went out following him.</p> 
                  <p>Went off in the carriage with him, and in the darkness lost her way.</p>

                  <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head> 
                  <p>SOMEWHERE in the ground there is a body lying that once walked round the streets bearing the name of Abraham Black. He lies in a long, narrow box, and the earth and the sod cover him from sight, as they hide other millions. His hand is as silent now as the hands of the old Egyptian kings which wielded sceptres once. His lips are as mute as the lips of the chief singer of all Israel, whose royal sepulture took place so many centuries ago. He has gone to the rest of Lazarus. Child that he was when he went forth, he shall grow in the kingdom of Heaven to the estate of angel.</p> 
                  <p>God bless you, Abraham! for you were kind to Philly.</p> 
                  <p>Yes-and dear. When she stood by your side on your dying-day, and promised and vowed to Wilhelm, even according to your bidding, the promise and vow were for your sake, not for her own. Every wrinkle of that old face of yours, lying now hidden by plank and dust from every human eye-every wrinkle was dear to her-dearer than the smooth young brow of<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6043-00000126"/> Wilhelm; the coarse, scant hairs turning gray upon your head won a gentle touch from her dear hand, unknown to Wilhelm. She kissed you when you were passing away. She would have held you, and kept you for ever. You know how faithful she was-how day and night she watched over you, sleepless-how she sent Wilhelm away till your last hour had come-because she would be alone with you. Man! thou art born again! grow in the heavenly kingdom; the hour has come at last! of deliverance? I call it not escape, but progress, this death of Abraham.</p> 
                  <p>How still it is in that room where Abraham died. The night is coming on. Neither Philly nor Wilhelm there. One is away at his labor; and Philly has slipped out for a moment. She will not be long away.</p> 
                  <p>Still the room is not vacant. On the bed there is some one lying.</p> 
                  <p>It is Ephraim! Not sleeping. He wakened an hour ago, but Philly thought that he slept when she went out; that was only her mistake.</p> 
                  <p>Follow the course of his thoughts. They lead you back many weeks; to the days before Abraham's death, before Philly was married to Wilhelm.</p> 
                  <p>To the morning when he went down the alley, presuming on that last great gift of his-only to look at Charlotte-perhaps no more than through the window as he passed by-to take one glance on with him as he went to his daily labor. To the moment when he crossed her threshold-only for a word-and found his gift lying there-and the work upon the floor, as when she sat with it around her-the candle burned out-the bed undisturbed-the bonnet and shawl gone, and she!</p> 
                  <p>To that day's waiting, watching, questioning, and searching.</p> 
                  <p>And to all that followed of vain inquiry, continued through many a day, until he saw her again at last; she, beyond question, beyond fear, beyond hope, in spite of crimson shawl, and robe of silk, and bonnet gay with plume and riband, she, Charlotte, flaunting in that carriage, driven here and there, according to her will.</p> 
                  <p>Had he been mad since then? He could only recall the mad thoughts of dissevered moments. How he had followed and lost her again and again; never succeeding in winning a word, or a glance of recognition. How he had been drawn, as one is drawn into the whirlpool, by the frenzy of his desperation; drinking, fighting, cherishing more and more a dark design of self-destruction, but hindered as often as he sought that remedy for the ruin that had overtaken his love.</p> 
                  <p>Philly had brought him here. He had fallen somewhere-in some conflict-before some blow; he remembered how he fell, and that the crowd closed upon him; and that then a sudden cry of "Philly!" had risen from the lips of hunchback Jim-no one ever could mistake that voice of Jim-and he had felt himself lifted, by whom he knew not, and carried<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6043-00000127"/> away, he knew not where. And now he was lying in this chamber, from which Philly had gone out a moment or two since.</p> 
                  <p>To this place, then, he had been borne. Here, how many days he knew not, he had been sheltered, nursed, and fed! By whom but Philly!</p> 
                  <p>Shame and self-contempt strove with the physical weakness under which he was laboring, for fever and delirium had held him there in chains many a weary day; shame, and self-contempt, distracting doubt, and changing purpose strove with him: he knew not what to do, dare, or believe.</p> 
                  <p>Philly had never deceived him. But Charlotte!-And he was lying there like a girl-cast down by a disappointment! This was not true, but it was the thought of which he was persuaded, as he lay there. It was not fever, but Charlotte. And he attempted to rise in the maddening impulse of his thoughts! Strong for the exertion he deemed himself to be; and still he delayed it till the sudden apprehension of Philly's return roused him. He would rise and go his way.</p> 
                  <p>He had but drawn himself from the bed, and stood leaning against it, when Philly came in. She, through the gathering darkness of the room, beheld him, and crossed the floor silently, quietly, but in great alarm, till she came close beside him; and he, beholding her, and convicted of his own helplessness as he stood there seeking in vain to move-burst into weeping.</p> 
                  <p>"Now Ephrim, don't," said Philly. "Don't," she repeated, still more urgent in her gentle entreaty, and she laid her hand pleading, even in its touch, upon his arm.</p> 
                  <p>"Philly," said Ephraim, "I'd rather a been took to the Toombs than here."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! that isn't kind to say. What would you go to the Toombs for? Sure this is pleasanter. Lie down, Ephrim. Do, dear. Do-you must;" and with gentle firmness Philly would have constrained him.</p> 
                  <p>But Ephraim, though he sat down on the bedside, spoke up like one who has not yielded so much as an inch of his ground. As if demanding a reckoning he asked-</p> 
                  <p>"How long have I been here? How many nights?"</p> 
                  <p>"Six: twelve, maybe."</p> 
                  <p>"Where did you sleep?"</p> 
                  <p>"Me and Wilhelm made us up a bed comfortable, close by. So we could keep an eye on you," answered Philly in her own honest, kindly way.</p> 
                  <p>But even her kindliness, disposed to regard as the simplest exercise of duty, this, her care of him, Ephraim seemed inclined to resent.</p> 
                  <p>Yes," said he, "a nice time I've made of it."</p> 
                  <p>"Out of your head you was, some, I think," admitted Philly. "But if you will only keep quiet awhile now, dear, you'll be well. If you don't it's more'n I can tell what'll happen."</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe I'll die," said Ephraim, in a despondency<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6043-00000128"/> dreadful for Philly to hear and see. "I would but for putting you to the trouble of seeing me underground. You've got better business in hand. I'll not lie down. I'm a-going back, somewhere, pretty soon, afore night, if you'll only let me stay a little longer, till I get rested a bit."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Ephrim! Ephrim!" sobbed Philly, despairingly, and she sat down on the bed beside him and wept aloud.</p> 
                  <p>"What's the matter?" asked he quickly, as if he were alarmed at this demonstration.</p> 
                  <p>"To see you so hard-so hard on me."</p> 
                  <p>"Hard! the devil! Quit, won't you? I ain't hard. I ain't hard on nobody. But I'd like to-to Philly! no matter. What be you crying for, girl?"</p> 
                  <p>"You forget what you did for me," sobbed Philly, "but I never forget: never. Ephrim, I took your kindness when you kept me alive nussing me through the fever. But you won't let me be doing you the same good turn when I've a chance. You break my heart, you do."</p> 
                  <p>"What do you want?" said Ephraim, turning from his miserable convictions to that recollection she had revived, with some evident satisfaction.</p> 
                  <p>"I want you to be good, and go to bed, and let us take care of you, me and Wilhelm, till you get better, Ephrim."</p> 
                  <p>"What'll I get better for?" said he almost savagely, returning on himself.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"So-why-so-why, what should anybody get better for, you dear old goose?"</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim looked at Philly. He stood under the cloud, she was far above him and saw it's upper radiance; far above him as Beatrice was above Dante. But some reflection of the brightness of her atmosphere was falling upon him-and moment by moment the power of reflecting seemed to increase in him. Still he said-</p> 
                  <p>"I don't want to get better. Why should I? I'd be glad to drop off any minute. But I'd rather have it happen in the street than up here. I'd be carried off by somebody. What's the odds, who? And no trouble except to the 'thorities. What did you pick me up for?"</p> 
                  <p>"What did you pick <emph>me</emph> up for, Eph, in the street once where I fell, and no one to see if I was dead or not, but you? What for, Ephrim?"</p> 
                  <p>This simple question had in it a world of consolatory thought for Ephraim. He forgot that he was a man, and a giant at that. He and Philly were equal in the favor they had conferred. The obligation was not after all so very enormous. But he had let Abraham pay for what he did for Philly! Well, then! there was something to live for, yet. There was honor in him yet-something to live for-the payment of a debt! But he said-</p> 
                  <p>"I'm used up and done for, Philly," though he began to be ashamed of the weakness of his murmurs.</p> 
                  <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6043-00000129"/> 
                  <p>Then said Philly, with great solemnity-</p> 
                  <p>"Ephrim, it's dreadful to hear you a-taking on so. It's you I used to think was the strongest man in the world."</p> 
                  <p>"I'm nothing but a great baby," said he.</p> 
                  <p>"How long will it take to grow up then?" asked she, "for you've got to be growed up agin, you know."</p> 
                  <p>"What for?" asked he, but as it seemed with no interest in the question, or in the answer that should come.</p> 
                  <p>"For-for everything."</p> 
                  <p>"Everything!"</p> 
                  <p>"For me and Wilhelm, and yourself-us three," she suggested seriously.</p> 
                  <p>"How do you know that?" Did not Philly see that ray of light that flashed through his heart! Her instinctive perception of that which was passing in his heart, was the perception which loving souls, and they only, have in perfection. Philly had not acquired her wisdom-and such wisdom as hers never is acquired. It is the gift of God.</p> 
                  <p>"How do I know it?" she mused. Then she brightened, and her spirit glowed through her words. "Do you think you can keep anything from Philly, Ephrim? I see it in your face-I see it in your face! Abraham used to say that I was great for that."</p> 
                  <p>This was true-she did see it, for he began to feel it. And the spirit of the strong man who had been overpowered, rose up to rebuke his weakness.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Philly," said he-and souls like that of the penitent thief upon the cross who said "Lord, remember me!" can understand how much the words cost him-"Philly, maybe I've been wasting time."</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe you have," she concurred with all her heart, "that's what I think about it myself."</p> 
                  <p>"There ain't nothing that I want on this earth," said he after a long pause, during which he had submitted to her assistance, and was now lying on the bed again. The thought of Charlotte had come upon him while Philly smoothed his pillow, and drew up the old coverlet over him-and it was that thought that made him denounce all things of earth.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, there is," she answered firmly. She knew; for she was happy.</p> 
                  <p>"What, then?" asked he; there was an earnestness in the question, in spite of the faintness of it, that inspired Philly with yet further confidence. Very boldly she spoke-</p> 
                  <p>"You want the little room next to ourn-and some work to do."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't. Why should I?" but the obstinacy of his words was all assumed-assumed with difficulty too.</p> 
                  <p>"That's a question! You want it to make it pleasanter-life, you know. Oh, Ephrim, many's the thing you've told me, and taught me! It's fair I'd give 'em back. But it's strange, too."</p> 
                  <p>She cheated me .... she did ...." said Eph-<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6043-00000130"/> raim, in a deep, low tone. "Maybe you're doing the same."</p> 
                  <p>"I, Ephrim!" exclaimed Philly in a voice that might have defied every charge of falsehood that the world could bring, so unquestionably honest, and so fearless.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know-<emph>she</emph> did," murmured Eph.</p> 
                  <p>"Where is she?" asked Philly.</p> 
                  <p>"The devil can tell you first. She's gone to the devil, Phil."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know him."</p> 
                  <p>"That's where. I see her once. I've follered around; I haven't done nothing else this six weeks but hunt for her."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Eph! what for?"</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know. For nothing."</p> 
                  <p>"Twouldn't have done no good-if she wanted to get away. If she's cheated you and gone, Ephrim, let her go."</p> 
                  <p>"I can't do anything else."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, you can."</p> 
                  <p>"What?"</p> 
                  <p>"Spend your time-and make us all fit for nothing but to cry-when she ain't worth the first drop of a tear."</p> 
                  <p>"Don't .... don't say that."</p> 
                  <p>"I won't then-but it's true."</p> 
                  <p>"Maybe it is .... but.... Philly. You love Wilhelm, I expect."</p> 
                   
                  <p>"He'll tell you that, Ephrim."</p> 
                  <p>"And Abraham-I expect you'd a said the same of him."</p> 
                  <p>"Abraham was the making on me. I never would a thought of Wilhelm most likely, but for him."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh!" said Ephraim, as if that were not in the least clear to him.</p> 
                  <p>"Never-for a long time yet"-she repeated. "It was all his doing. He was old, and you wouldn't expected it, but so good to me, and such a great man, though so little. When I lay there on that bed beside him, and heard his breath come shorter and shorter, I held him so in my arms, as if that could keep him: Willy knows all about it. Oh, Eph, it was dreadful! Worse than for you to lose Charlotte."</p> 
                  <p>"Worse and better," said he; believing, and gently he spoke, with sympathy-even with tears. Through her tears Philly then, with an effort at cheerful speaking by no means unsuccessful, said-</p> 
                  <p>"But I'm living right along. And Wilhelm and me are kind to each other; and we love each other, and work together, and I'm happy. So is he, Ephrim. He would rather stay here with me when he might a-gone, and good luck with him."</p> 
                  <p>Ephraim turned away his face from Philly-he closed his eyes. An angel had ministered to him: and he let Charlotte go.</p> 
                  <p>But still Philly kept her watch beside him-she was busying herself for his comfort when Wilhelm<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6043-00000131"/> came in. Quietly he came, for he was thoughtful as Philly, and for her sake thoughtful, in the sick man's behalf. Ephraim was waking in the twilight and the silence from a peaceful, tranquil slumber, when he heard Philly say-</p> 
                  <p>"He is better. He is going to get well. And he's going to have the little room to the front; won't that be pleasant, Wilhelm? See! he is awake; don't he look better?"</p> 
                  <p>"Old fellow, I'm glad to hear that," said Wilhelm, going up to the bed, and cordially grasping Ephraim's hand.</p> 
                  <p>And Eph cried out-because he could no more control his heart, than that mighty voice, which was now indeed beyond his control-"Hurrah! I'm alive yet. I ain't a fool quite, Philly."</p> 
                  <p>So! let them go. Their life's purpose is all answered.</p> 
                  <p>Never shall Ephraim mount higher in this world than to the box of an omnibus. Philly and Wilhelm doubtless must persevere in moulding images, and printing medallions through all their mortal days. So let them go their way ...</p> 
                  <p>How tame and flat the ending!</p> 
                  <p>But then has Eph's omnibus-box no higher elevation than the seat of Charlotte's carriage? What! had not Philly, moulding images, a freedom which image-worshippers have never!</p> 
                   
                  <p>Ah! you would like to hear that Ephraim built a palace in his declining years, and worried through a mockery of splendors he could never understand, or really possess, and so into his pyramid. And that Philly put on fine raiment and sat down to feasts.</p> 
                  <p>I am glad to say they never did either. I am happy to record that their life was indeed absolutely independent of these circumstances which enchant the souls of infidels. I exceedingly rejoice in writing down the fact that these persons unconsciously gave in their lives the testimony that the splendid dream philosophers have dreamed is veritably possible. That the Truth Christ Jesus taught is veritably True! That a man's LIFE consisteth not in the abundance of the things he possesseth.</p> 
                  <p>Philly! there are image-makers in the world who adore the gods they fashion. You are wiser than they.</p> 
                  <p>There are people who sit down to eat and drink, and rise up to dance and play: you are better fed, and better clad, and you are happier than they. There are young girls, Philly, who will read this tale, and never think to look up with longing, and say, "Oh, Sacred Truth teach us, that <emph>we</emph> may LIVE!" Daughter of a Royal Line! they will even grieve for you, who might wisely bemoan their own exceeding poverty and ignorance and blindness. Mothers, there are, who dare bring children to the light of day, but fail even to the uttermost, of their high calling; who<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6043-00000132"/> never taught their children how the world, and flesh and devil, can be renounced, for they never learned the lesson.</p> 
                  <p>There is a great world, Philly, very fair to you, which is the hell of thousands-a hell of their own making. For the earth has been redeemed! Envying and strife, malice and evil speaking, all uncharitableness, are that hell's elements. But of these things you know nothing. Your world has been redeemed-and there is nothing that may hurt, nothing that can destroy. Nevertheless, for this rejoice not that power over the spirits is given unto you, but that your Name is written in Heaven! But-say you, reader-in the satisfaction of her heart, Philly, being woman, was satisfied? FRIEND, IS IT NOT ALL, WHEN ONE HAS THE HEART TO BE SATISFIED?</p>

                  <head type="sub">BORN BLIND.</head> 
                  <p>TWO girls grew up from infancy to maidenhood in Alley No. 10.</p> 
                  <p>It seemed as if the younger of the two had "growed"-for she had not a discoverable relation in the world. Who her parents were, no mortal man could tell. She first came to herself in Alley No. 10, and her personal associations were entirely confined to such people as could endure to tenant the hovels of this row. And not only was she alone, a solitary, because homeless. Awful calamity heightened the misery of her condition into helplessness. She was born blind. On the sidewalk she spent her infancy; uncared for, unprotected. In that desperate neighborhood she lived defenceless; unguarded; unless the heavenly angels of love and mercy had charge concerning her.</p> 
                  <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6043-00000134"/> 
                  <p>All other tenants of the house, in the attic passage-way of which she slept, were of the migratory order: an order never stationary except in its wretchedness. In that self-same corner whither she had crept in the footsteps of an ascending lodger, there where in her desolate infancy she had lain down to sleep, becoming from that night attached to the place because of the security she felt in its quiet; there, for years, night by night, through winter and through summer, she had found her place of shelter and of rest.</p> 
                  <p>How she contrived to live it is a grievous thing to tell. Food a slave had spurned had been her sustenance. She had never known a luxury, and scanty were the husks that fell to her from the baskets of the beggars. The beggars had themselves to feed-and hunger! why it can make cannibals of Christians.</p> 
                  <p>The girl had none to take upon themselves the clothing of her nakedness for the "sweet sake" of charity-she paid for every breath she drew, down in that noxious alley. She was gentle in her ways-and to be trusted-and thus it had come to pass that she was looked upon as, in some sort, the guardian of those children of the neighborhood whose parents went out to daily labor, even when she was herself hardly beyond the stage of infancy.</p> 
                  <p>She had grown into the occupation of this office, and was not only the guardian, but was regarded as such by the mothers in her vicinity. In the courtyard, or upon the door-step, or, on stormy days, upon the stair, she gathered depravity and raggedness around her, and it was wonderful to see her management of the vile horde-how she contrived to hold them by her talk or song; how she settled their disputes-how she soothed and entertained them. I say it was most wonderful to see the control she exercised over the wild elements that raged around her the moment they came into such contact with her as to feel her influence. Untaught of others, she could only impart the instincts of her nature. The notion that there was something in her authority which it was quite impossible to withstand, or disregard, seemed to prevail among the children generally. When she sang, silence reigned throughout the circle of listeners-clamorous voices became strangely mild when they addressed each other in her hearing. Her blindness seemed indeed to have made room for the large endowment of a commanding sense unknown to them, which of right ruled them.</p> 
                  <p>She was the general depository of the troubles of the elder children; and certainly the wisest counsellor they could have found, for she shared and sympathize with them in their afflictions, and though she could not aid them to escape, nor knew if such a thing were possible, she could show them how they might best endure, their fortune.</p> 
                  <p>Nor was her influence confined to this circle of infancy<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6043-00000135"/> fancy. Tired and unhappy wretches found a refreshment in her presence which they could not account for, neither comprehend. They had compassion for her, pity for her-and thus a humanizing influence, however slight, was exercised in turn upon themselves. Rarely were their own griefs, or wrongs, or degradation, the subject of deliberate contemplation among them; but the blind girl's helplessness was a thought over which the most hardened sometimes lingered, and salutary, if evanescent, was the impulse thus aroused.</p> 
                  <p>What the blindness actually was to Jenny, of this they never pondered. Whether the fair inward vision which was unquestionably hers, compensated for the loss of outward sight, was a question unraised in their minds. Among those who, like her, had always inhabited quarters like this Alley No. 10, there were not a few who had never seen the sunrise, nor gazed upon the splendid sunset heavens, nor watched the changing seasons midst woods, and fields, on river banks, and mountain heights. And yet, they pitied her!</p> 
                  <p>They pitied her; they who could behold the squalor around them, and the ruin in each other! They who had looked on the hideous disguises of life, who had gone hand in hand with famine, and endured the caresses of pestilence-who had looked at death, and into living faces far more cruel and relentless-who had been thrown to the wall when Fashion and Pride went by-who had been tempted to ruin by the splendors of Folly, who had been maimed by the idol's car, under whose wheels they had fallen, struck down by the wanton and insolent hand of "brief authority"-they who had gazed at life from the beggar's side and grown desperate and infidel with gazing, they had pity for this girl who could not see, she who sat on the door-step, or walked in the court, singing the songs her quick ear had caught of the street-organists, telling the children tales of life, as it went on in her imagination, to her isolated fancy.</p> 
                  <p>Tales of Life!</p> 
                  <p>Jenny had no prettiness, no beauty; but she had a statue's calmness. Calamity had tended to produce in the development of years, her startling countenance. It was a face that had known greater changes than years alone could make. Once it had worn an intense, imploring, anxious expression. An expression that overspread her childish features as the greatness of the idea of her loss was forced upon her; but this had disappeared again; resignation took its place then-and the repose of her countenance was a sad thoughtfulness-the calmness of knowledge. The baffled spirit, once constantly on the alert to make its escape into the light of day, and the presence of human beings, the activity of an unobstructed life, had in some manner yielded its obedience to her Savior's "Peace! be still." It looked now, this young<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6043-00000136"/> face, like peace itself-and this was the reason that turbulent spirits felt her presence, and contrived to keep away from her if the evil in them was uppermost. The most profane reserved their oaths, and the most quarrelsome their wrath, as often as they came within the circle of her influence.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">KIT.</head> 
                  <p>IT was after the knowledge of her blindness had possessed itself of Jenny's mind, and wrought its work there, that an Irish girl named Kit, came to be her friend.</p> 
                  <p>Kit was a street-beggar, an impulsive, passionate child, always in difficulty, quarrelsome, ugly, unmanageable. Her heart and home were full of misery. To scenes of fighting and bloodshed were her young eyes most familiar; and by her parents' fireside the worst qualities of her nature were those called oftenest into exercise.</p> 
                  <p>Only when her tired feet climbed up to Jenny's corner, and she sat down in that quiet place beside the blind girl, and shared her crust with her, only in such moments did she experience the blessedness of peace, the comfort of security.</p> 
                  <p>In the streets she was bold and dauntless; there she was ready to fight her way through whatever obstructions should arise, but here, and here only, when night came down on avenue and alley, resting by her<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6043-00000137"/> blind friend's side, listening to her song, or story, here only did she find the trustful love and confident repose which the young child of better fortunes seeks in his mother's arms, when night finds him tired of play.</p> 
                  <p>The friendship had begun without prospect of continuance or progress.</p> 
                  <p>The singing voice of Jenny attracted Kit, a stranger in the alley, and she stopped to listen while on her way to the place where her father and mother lived. The influence of the blind singer's face was deeper, more abiding, than her song. It haunted Kit, as the face of Madonna haunts the mind of the young artist. Day after day she stopped to look at it; sometimes without exchanging a word with Jenny, but oftener to lay in her hand some token of the fruits of her day's labor. So Jenny came to listen for, and know Kit's step. From the first time that her smiling and expectant face assured Kit of the fact, she loved the blind girl, and in her heart adopted her.</p> 
                  <p>But Jenny was not the sole recipient of the good influences of this friendship. Physically, Kit was stronger than her sister in misfortune; in spite of exposure to the season, and to every want, she was developing, year by year, in strength, and in resources of defence. But Jenny, notwithstanding this disparity, became in some sense the protector, in turn, of her companion. She was the counsellor, while she derived from the contagious influence of Kit's free speech and doing, her bravery and decision, fresh courage, and activity, both of brain and body.</p> 
                  <p>Love is the centre of the Universe: God, the centre of all real human life. Around this point revolves all human harmony and joy. And the sympathy of brotherhood is the divine attestation of the world's redemption. Some evidence of this fact was given by these poor tenants of the alley in their unguided lives. Genuine, however slight-reliable, however unpretending! They clung to one another. The strength, the tenderness of their natures was exercised for the enrichment of each other. Kit grew more human, Jenny more hopeful and light-hearted, and they understood each other as only lovers do. As by instinct they understood, and sought, each, to lessen the care that pressed with peculiar weight on the heart of the other. From the chaos of their lives, something herein appeared, something on which hope and affection might rely.</p> 
                  <p>Here was society to which, through the day's discomfort, and weariness, and rebellious discontent, poor Kit could, and did, look forward, with more and more of certainty and trustfulness, as time went on... Through the loneliness of unshared thoughts, and the gloom of solitude, the prospect of evening and Kit came to the blind girl, the sweetest of her prospects, the cherished of her heart. These girls supplied to each other every human relation. The Leaven was not wanting even here.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">DOGS AT THE BEGGARS' BANQUET.</head> 
                  <p>KIT had pursued the calling of a beggar from the day that she was able to guide her own steps and tongue; no friendly counsel, no helping, mortal hand had ever offered to lead her faculties in any other direction. And in real life fairies do not come to do the work of Christians; so let no one look to see an angel in this Kit. Accident, as it would seem, alone diverted her attention from her calling.</p> 
                  <p>Returning one night from her usual round, she dropped the bundle of scraps which she had gathered from door to door, and from barrels and troughs of refuse which stood just beyond the pavement, inviting the attention of inspectors such as she.</p> 
                  <p>As the food fell to the ground, two dogs darted toward it, and for a moment seemed disposed to contend with her for possession of the broken fragments; but after snuffing the unsavory mess a moment they contemptuously tossed their heads, and trotted away, leaving the owner in undisputed possession.</p> 
                  <p>Kit watched that movement, doubting if she understood. Then, to give her dark suspicion trial, she rose in bewildered amazement from the position into which she had thrown herself while thinking to defend her property, and she whistled and called to the curs-and presently, though with wonderful deliberation, they paid heed to her call, walking slowly back. With an air and an effect that would have put an attitudinarian, or a stage-ranter to the blush, she pointed to the banquet-to the "beggar's banquet of unsavory things"-"Eat!" was the solitary, the authoritative exclamation that issued from her lips.</p> 
                  <p>She was not mistaken in her suspicion-suspicion so cruel and wrathful that she dared not entertain it, until she had put it to the test. Alas! after eying the food with a curious scorn, and smelling it with a disgust that proved the charity to be abomination, one of the dogs picked a bone out of the medley-but the next instant he dropped it again, and followed on after his companion.</p> 
                  <p>She was not more brute than they. Not less disdainful than the dogs, she turned herself from that painfully gathered refuse, left the evening meal for which hunger waited at home, left it to be trodden underfoot, or brushed aside, or else to be devoured by want such as the street dogs knew not.</p> 
                  <p>Kit went home with empty hands. She anticipated the reception she should meet, but she was prepared to say, and to abide by the saying, that she would starve before she would go out again to beg. She anticipated<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6043-00000139"/> ticipated the reception of that rebellious declaration, but not the consequences of her words, or she would have gone with greater rejoicing, for when she was driven from the miserable den to find a shelter for herself, never went more willing exile forth. There was but one to whom she could go now-and to Jenny she went.</p> 
                  <p>Jenny was asleep when Kit climbed the dark stair; she did not waken when Kit threw herself beside her on the heap of straw.</p> 
                  <p>With difficulty did the young outcast restrain the indignant words that crowded on her lips, and yet she did restrain them, and by-and-by the sleeper's tranquil breathing brought gentler and more tranquil thoughts to her.</p> 
                  <p>Faint with long fasting, she had eaten nothing all the day, and weary, for she had not rested from her tramp since morning, Kit closed her eyes, but not to sleep, not to forget. Life opened to her as it never had before. Wide became the prospect, but not bright, not fair. The waters of the river she was crossing, blackened as they rose; it was a bitter, angry flood; evil to drink of-dangerous to ford; and Canaan did not lie beyond.</p> 
                  <p>It is always a moment momentous when the eyes of youth are for the first time wakened to life. Oftener the inexperienced eyes close suddenly, in momentary heart-sinking, dark foreboding fear, than strain wide with delight at the prospect. In the midst of a path stretching darkly among shadows, a shadow darker, more mysterious than she had yet seen, rose before the eyes of Kit.</p> 
                  <p>The pampered children and magnificently dressed women that crowded the city streets by day, swept in unending procession before her eyes, and accustomed though they had been to such scenes from their first opening, it was as if they had never, until now, gazed on them. She beheld herself, ragged, filthy, hungering, fed with stuff the dogs loathed, making her way through that crowd, of less moment to those women than the bits of lace and broidery that hung in the shop-windows-of far less moment than the coal-dust trailed along the pavement by their splendid brocades. And now the everlasting WHY sprung up malignantly, asking for an answer she might never make. The scales were not in her hands, she might never adjust the balance, nor, perhaps, apprehend the compensations of her lot. She could only feel her degradation and want in this extremity.</p> 
                  <p>In that wakeful night the steam of tempting delicacies rose before her from marble tables on which they were spread-she saw the feasting that went on in those saloons across whose threshold such as she were never bidden-the fragrance wafted past her half-starved sense, was more delicious than the perfume that steals up to poets from the Persian gardens. She stood, as she had stood a thousand times, and gazed on the heaps of fruits from every<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6043-00000140"/> climate, golden and purple, and scarlet pyramids; their names and origin she knew not; their taste was unknown; these fruits of the ground ripened not, nor were gathered for such children of the earth as she.</p> 
                  <p>It was her outraged moral sense that proclaimed itself in such ways to Kit's hearing. And trifling as these thoughts and questionings may appear, they were not trifling to her; they had a distinct place, and a strange significance. The old tragic result was pending in the young girl's mind.</p> 
                  <p>The grief, the indignation, and the wonderment, were not more easily borne because of the magnanimity with which Kit restrained her tongue, and endured her thoughts alone. No weak and selfish mind was that which, in the struggle between will and necessity, chose, in its loving consideration for another, to fight the battle without a witness; to receive, without a witness, the conviction of her helplessness, and of the vanity of conflict.</p> 
                  <p>It was an awful experience to know. It was a crisis in which Kit's nature seemed to undergo a radical change. Had she lifted her head that night when she fought, with thoughts all driving earthward, when she fought with the beasts of earth, she would have seen and known that the battle was not unwatched ... But, though the stars were in the heavens, they looked down silent through the sky-light, sending no reflection, no enlivenment into the darkness beneath. He who fashioned them, could He see less than they?</p> 
                   
                  <p>In that single night Kit's gayety and cheerfulness seemed to have vanished for ever. Darkness, found her a passionate, grieving, over-laden child. The light of dawn looked down on the pale face of a weary and fainting woman who waited only for the day that she might go forth to enter on the career she had marked out for herself, knowing not that for her The Day would surely come.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">"THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE."</head> 
                  <p>BEFORE Jenny had wakened Kit went out. She made great haste to go-she would accomplish some what before Jenny should know what had happened. She would endeavor and do, that she might claim the blind girl's confidence, before she told her that henceforth one home and destiny was theirs.</p> 
                  <p>Of the woman that lived on the first floor, whose children were frequently in Jenny's keeping, she borrowed an old fragment of a broom, and armed with that she went down the alley toward the street.</p> 
                  <p>The city had not drawn its waking breath as yet. The struggle was as yet a full hour distant. But Kit was impatient of solitude and quiet; and time and rest had not any special value in her eyes. Shivering she went along the street toward the park. A dense fog was creeping up from the sea; already it had settled over that part of the town from which she was emerging. As she hurried along in advance of it, trailing her broom over the pavement, to the eyes of such as wandered about in bewilderment and unsteadiness searching for their lodgings, she might have passed for the embodied spirit of the fog; so wan her face was, so wildly her black hair fell about her ears and forehead, so unearthly she looked in the gray morning, walking there in the degradation and squalor of her poverty.</p> 
                  <p>Kit had nearly perished of the small-pox in her infancy-and her scarred face gave evidence of its ravages. But it bore traces of other severities than of merciless disease. Wounds which no more gentler care than that of time had soothed, marked both cheek and forehead! she was, indeed, a young "soldier of fortune"-and rarely had she come off a conqueror from her conflicts. Yet her dark eyes, as she now went up the, silent street, had not the look of a spirit that readily surrenders: they seemed hopeful, and yet, in truth, not confident of victory. There was no hiding-place for her-she was aware. No pathway of escape for her was open. She knew no passage of retreat. She was here courageously to do her best; to beg no more, but valiantly to labor.</p> 
                  <p>Thus it was that Kit had risen to a new, strange sense of dignity, and of capacity; even in the hour when she found herself an outcast, she had assumed the post and duty of a protector of one more helpless than herself-had found for herself a home and an occupation.</p> 
                  <p>Her sturdy figure was the first in the park that morning. There all day, till the evening lamps were lighted, she worked. And with good success. Until<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6043-00000142"/> noon the fog prevailed, and then a dismal rain set in-the best thing that could happen to the sweepers, especially to one like Kit. She was commander-in-chief of all the forces there that day. So active, so untiring, as if her heart were in her work, and that indeed it was. She had her bread to get, and Jenny at home to share it. How she managed! Street children know their masters. She never held out her hand to the body who would pay her without it; she never contrived to find her way into the pool of water that the gentleman might have free room to pass, if his countenance indicated insensibility, or abstraction, or unconsciousness of anything like poverty and need in all the world. She was an actress on the stage that day, and well she played her part. It had its moral-and-reward.</p> 
                  <p>For, when night drew on, and the lamp-lighters came round, Kit found herself rich enough to go home. She could buy a supper for Jenny and herself. Oh, "the sweet sense of providing!" With the meal that she had purchased, she set out for the alley, and the thought of her drenched garments, and mud-bound feet and limbs, you may be sure, did not much trouble her. Those coppers tied up securely in the corner of her shawl, and tucked away in the bosom of her dress, were not they earnings voluntarily paid her? for not once that day had she asked charity. She had worked, this was her pay.</p> 
                  <p>But, not to the lodging on the stairway, not to Jenny, did Kit return that night. Before she reached the house her fleet steps were arrested by a crowd of quarrelling men and women, who had taken possession of Alley No. 10, with the purpose of settling some difficulty which had risen among the ring-leaders in a cellar near by. Kit paused on the outer-circle of the crowd, not curious to learn what was going on, as no doubt at another time she would have been. For, strange as it may seem to order-loving people, what goes on in the streets has a peculiar interest to street-folk. She halted there because it was impossible for her to proceed. But presently she found herself borne, as she had been a hundred times before in her short life, within the circle of the whirlpool of passion, and fighting with the rest, but-only for the preservation of that precious supper she was carrying home.</p> 
                  <p>From this position she was presently extricated-not by her own efforts-but, by the aid of the police. The blow she had accidentally received on her forehead, was considered substantial proof of her criminality in the case, and on the examination, in spite of her asseverations, she was sentenced to three months' imprisonment in the penitentiary-and all that remained for her to do, was to yield to the sentence. The more quietly the better. Quietly it was-so quietly indeed, that some who saw her made account of her as a desperate old offender; but, she was only crushed into silence by conscious helplessness, and bitter disappointment.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">KIT IN THE COUNTRY.</head> 
                  <p>DURING her imprisonment the Irish girl was thrown among desperate characters. Even into closer connection with them than heretofore-for when at large she never sought such companionship as she found here.</p> 
                  <p>She had no friends in the alley except Jenny, and of her she thought now night and day. The thought softened her heart; often it stayed the angry word and oath; it bowed her in submission and repentance; and oh! it roused her from her stubborn despair to new, strange courage, hope, and valorous determination. Was there no virtue here ? This was, perhaps, the best of all ordeals through which Kit could be made to pass. The imprisonment was unjust: and the fact that she was now punished for an offence of which she was guiltless, though of similar offences she had oftentimes been guilty, placed her in precisely the position toward those surrounding her, that enabled her to perceive them as they were; and to see the living contrast between these people and blind Jenny!</p> 
                   
                  <p>As she sat in judgment on herself, more akin to her own nature's wickedness, its pravity, seemed the defiance and boldness of these women, than did the patience, and composure, the loving-kindness of the blind girl.</p> 
                  <p>A stranger pausing on the threshold of the room in which she with scores of prisoners sat, would not, could not have distinguished between her and the rest; would not have pronounced her far above them in sentiment, in virtues, or in capacity;-might even have discovered in the crowd of convicts milder faces than poor Kit's, gentler manners, but not a heart more accessible, not a soul more conscious of the greatness of its wants.</p> 
                  <p>She had, from the beginning, little to say to those by whom she was surrounded, and less and less as time went on. There was, at first, some spirited declamation, in reference to the position in which she found herself-some strong mental resistance to the restrictions put upon her; but the coarse sympathy and profane utterance which the statement of her case excited, yielded no great consolation, and presently it was not only undesired, but positively unwelcome. It was a well-intended sympathy, such as the giver could give, but it was another sort of comfort than the blind girl would have imparted, and Kit yearned for the embracing arms, and the soft words of Jenny. Indignant words of self-justification died on her lips, and found no further life even in her thoughts. Day and<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6043-00000144"/> night she felt those eyes, which never had beheld her, those blinded eyes, fixed on her soul, and before their miraculous insight she shrank, aware of guilt, and of ill-deserving, as before no other gaze. The pity that was in them did not insult her soul's integrity. Even their condemnation was the condemnation of love, life-giving, though destroying. For before the eyes of love sin perishes.</p> 
                  <p>But not chance alone was influencing Kit in these days. Until she came to the penitentiary she had never been even so short a distance as this from the turmoil and crowd of the city's streets. The effect of the tranquillity and beauty of the prospect now before her was deep and abiding; for her the lovely river did not flow in vain-not in vain did the unobstructed, unbroken arch of heaven spread before her sight. Day and night opened upon her in all their wonderful beauty, with a charm as new and strange as if she had been born without the power of seeing.</p> 
                  <p>She was, moreover, clothed and fed, and the labor required of her relieved the quiet of its monotony. For <emph>her</emph> the sun now shone, for her it rose and set in splendor; for her the moon-beams fell upon the river, on distant towns and villas, on gardens, on the great city whose myriad spires reflected their silver light. For her the trees of June were full of leaves, and birds, and melody. She had come hither as a prisoner; but the prison was fairy-land, was Eden, to poor Kit.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Not uneventful had her brief journey to the island lying in the midst of the river, been. As she went up to the boat, in the same car with herself, opposite her, sat a blind old woman, attended by a lad who had in his charge a hand-organ, and Kit overheard one of the passengers saying to another, that the old body was born blind, and that the boy was her son, and that the woman had supported herself through many a year by her music.</p> 
                  <p>Kit recollected this, and it was of use to her. When she heard it she began to wish, and long before the time of her sentence had expired her plans for future conduct were all made. She would return to the alley-she would resume her interrupted labors: her one day's success assured her that she should again succeed, and when, by street-sweeping she had earned sufficient to procure an organ, she and Jenny would set out together in search of their fortune: they would go away into the beautiful country, and in its quiet and refreshment would forget all that they had learned in the dreary city streets.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE RETURN.</head> 
                  <p>THUS it was, and for this purpose alone, that Kit returned to the alley where she had spent her wretched childhood. Changed, and greatly for the better, she returned-changed, and not by the discipline to which she had been subjected so much as by the peace and comfort that encompassed her in that place of her sojourning; and the new aspect under which life and nature had appeared to her.</p> 
                  <p>Her own family had disappeared from No. 10; it was not their residence she sought, nor yet that of Jenny. Farther down the lane she found a shelter, and now, night and morning, as she went to and fro, she was compelled to pass the place where Jenny lived, and never did she pass it without first stopping to inquire after her friend, or without climbing the stairway to see, with her own eyes, how life went on with her charge. But she never made herself known in these visits. She had yet somewhat to accomplish.</p> 
                  <p>Thus week after week Kit came and went, and by the end of summer, so had she labored, so had she husbanded her earnings, she was prepared to carry one part of her stout-hearted plan into execution: to procure the organ with whose virtues and defects she had made herself familiar by continual examinations, the organ and a tambourine, of the Italian who kept on hand a stock of such things which he rented at certain rates to such musicians as could not afford to purchase them.</p> 
                  <p>Rich in these possessions, one night Kit toiled with them up the stairway, from which she had now for several days exiled herself.</p> 
                  <p>Jenny was asleep when she went up, and instead of waking her, according to her first impulse, Kit's face broke from its momentary expression of disappointment into a gay smile, and she threw herself upon the straw and sunk into a slumber. She was at home once more!</p> 
                  <p>With her first waking motion Jenny's arms took Kit in their embrace, and Kit was roused from her sleep by that dear voice whose reproach was vainly endeavoring to stifle the joy of her heart, saying:-</p> 
                  <p>"Oh Kit, where have you been? How could you stay away so long? I thought you would never come again."</p> 
                  <p>"I've come from not fur away," answered the delighted Kit; rising and freeing herself from Jenny's embrace only to fold the child to her own heart, assuming then and for ever the protectorate, as in her own<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6043-00000146"/> heart and conscience she had done long ago. "I've come from a-thinking and a-thinking of ye, me own darling, to be with ye all the time. Faith! did ye miss me, Jenny, sure?"</p> 
                  <p>"Every morning-every morning here I waited for you. Many's the time I listened, many, many, thinking that I heerd you a-going down the stairs, or a-coming up 'em. Was it you, Kit? Sometimes I called, but ne'er an answer came. I wanted you so bad. I was all gone when you went off. Oh dear.... But it's all over."</p> 
                  <p>Silently Kit brushed away the tears that gathered fast in her eyes; choking down the utterance which her emotion sought, she asked, as if her guardian care had ever been remitted, night or day, since her return from the island-</p> 
                  <p>"You've been a-living on here just the same?"</p> 
                  <p>"Just the same Kit....Just."</p> 
                  <p>"And no one ... well. I've come to take the care now.-Been a-learnin' any new songs, dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh Kit, I've been yonder to the church since-and heard such beautiful music."</p> 
                  <p>"To the church? .... That's right," said Kit in grave approval. Then she seemed to deliberate; finally she asked-"Can you sing it? Sing away, dear, anything." And she sat up to listen, full of expectation and decision.</p> 
                  <p>"I did sing it for the children. But do <emph>you</emph> want to hear it, Kit?"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Get along wid you, Jenny. Fire away."</p> 
                  <p>Thus bidden, in the dim, dull daybreak, amidst the dilapidation and discomfort of that uppermost landing, the sweet, and not unskilful, voice of Jenny echoed the hymn that had praised God in the sanctuary. Kit listened with profound attention.</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know nothing about the church," she said thoughtfully. "I wasn't never there. But ne'er a song did I hear finer. Ye'll do. Yes ye can do it, Jenny. Who's afeared? Look a-here now, I've got something to tell ye. I can't sing, ye know, <emph>but</emph>"-here Kit in great excitement produced the hand-organ, and while with one hand she ground a tune from its mysterious recesses, with the other she flourished the tambourine. "Do you understand?" she presently stopped to ask, "I've been a-buying ye now-and you belongs to me."</p> 
                  <p>"I don't know what you mean, Kit-I can't begin to think." Jenny said this, but the face on which Kit looked was bright with confidence and gladness, And Kit seemed to enjoy her perplexity, and before she answered, she played another tune-a merrier than the first.</p> 
                  <p>"Me to carry the organ, and you to shake the tambourine, a keeping time, and a passing of it round to the audience for the pay. Me a-leading you, honey, and you doing astonishin' things with that voice of yourn, and we a getting rich and walking off when<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6043-00000147"/> we git ready, no one to hinder or push-to the counthry, and <emph>then</emph> won't ye find out!"</p> 
                  <p>And having made this boastful prelude, Kit explained and narrated all she had to tell; but the hurried story was brought to an abrupt conclusion, for the rising and uncontrollable storm of emotion before which Jenny bent down, quivering in every limb, swept away all the defences of the heroic speaker's heart.</p> 
                  <p>Still struggling, but vainly, against the rising torrent, she exclaimed:-</p> 
                  <p>"There! there, take that," and she thrust a whole loaf into Jenny's hands. "I brought it for yer supper last night, but ye was asleep when I came in. Yer won't be eating crusts and bones and sich like agin. Not while there's a breath left in my body. Eat! you haven't had a loaf like that in one time, have ye now, me dear?"</p> 
                  <p>Jenny took the food, not the loaf only, but the cake, and the apple, for she could not help herself-they were thrust into her hands and arms by Kit-but the gift and the declaration, instead of distracting her thoughts from their drift, impelled them onward more impetuously into expression.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh Kit! Kit! if I could only see your face once. Only for a minit. I know what it's like, but oh, to see it! It's like what the gentleman talked about in the church, I know. And you to be a-thinking of me all this time!"</p> 
                   
                  <p>At this outburst Kit's face became as violently red and confused, as if she had been guilty of some gross imposture. She had intended to keep the secret of her imprisonment to herself, but now Jenny must know all. She could better endure blame and abuse, than praise. And so she said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Where do ye think I've been now, all this while?"</p> 
                  <p>Jenny could not guess.</p> 
                  <p>"To the island," said Kit bravely.</p> 
                  <p>But Jenny was still in the dark.</p> 
                  <p>"Ye know," said Kit hurriedly, "don't yer?"</p> 
                  <p>"Whereabouts may that be?" asked Jenny timidly, feeling that she ought to know.</p> 
                  <p>"I went in a boat to get there, you know," said Kit.</p> 
                  <p>"That must a' been delightful!"</p> 
                  <p>"To a big house-big enough to hold a thousand. Big as a hotel!"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh Kit-but that was elegant!"</p> 
                  <p>"No it wa'n't, Jenny. It wa'n't-it broke me heart. The disgrace of it!"</p> 
                  <p>Jenny was dumb.</p> 
                  <p>"But if I hadn't a' gone, there'd a been no organ, faith; no morning like this waking up so happy. It made our fortin, it did, going off to the island-so never mind now, Jenny, it's all over. And I'm glad, I am."</p> 
                  <p>"What took you off, Kit? Was you nabbed, Kit?"</p> 
                  <p>"They jist took me by the arm, and led me off, ye<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6043-00000148"/> know. I might a' screamed bloody murther, divil a bit they'd care. I was in the midst of the row, ye know, with a black eye to me head. And so they sent me along wid the rest. Oh thin, but there was the same as a thousand divils let loose in me breast, and distracting thoughts of yees, what would become of yees, me child.-But here I am, faith! and I'd like the officerman to present hisself afore me that could separate us agin, me dear. Och, Jenny. I'd be shameder to look at yees if I went in me own quarrel. But it was all horrid jist, and none of mine. We'll have another air now-here's the tambourine. Shake away, me hearty." Never was that old organ, even in its best days, given over to more vigorous grinding than now, when Kit had spoken her confession. Jenny took the tambourine, and shook it with an emphasis; tears were upon her cheeks-her pale, thin cheeks.</p> 
                  <p>Her share in the music was the best expression she could give just then to the admiration Kit's story had excited. To the admiration and the indignation-for in spite of Kit's recognition of the good results of the injustice of her imprisonment, Jenny was disposed to resent the fact that Kit had been suspected, and accused, and convicted of a wrong. But Kit talked her into a quiet acceptation of the fact at length, the task was not so difficult: and then they practised all the organ tunes, and conquered the tambourine, and went out into the world.</p> 
                   
                  <p>Thus it was that Kit assumed openly her charge, and her responsibilities. Thus these two lives emerged together from the dark waves of the sea of obscurity, and joined themselves to the army of poverty that lives by its wits in the streets.</p> 
                  <p>Brave in the conscious integrity of irrreproachable virtue, strong in the strength which a single victory inspires in the heart of the soldier, Kit led Jenny forth to their new field.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE NEW JERUSALEM.</head> 
                  <p>SOME persons, gracious in sympathies, might suppose that here was a fact presented in the lives of these two girls, which no charitable eye beholding could overlook, or misapprehend. Other some might arraign society, or providence, for the peculiarities of their condition. To such-<emph>the poor you have with you always:</emph> this tale is not a treatise on political economy-neither an exhibition, in particulars, of the world's selfishness.</p> 
                  <p>The girls were there in the street-that is our present fact-look at it, and call it, if you must, a superficial view.</p> 
                  <p>The crowd that rushed along the streets could not be supposed to know anything of the heroism, the virtue, and the purpose of the elder ill-dressed hard-featured girl-nor did it understand that the younger of the two was blind. If it glanced at them, quite probably it thought the one brazen and the other a sneak. To those that stumbled past them, eager to get on, oppressed with cares, driven by inward convictions victions which have their ample attestations in hourly events, that a moment's rest, an instant's slacking of the hand, or staying of the foot, might insure ruin to themselves, to such, and to the remainder of the crowd who bent on their mission of vanity and sin, to all these the young street-singers were but common vagrants, into whose present or future they had no need, or time, or power, or "call," to look. THE BOOK enjoins on men and women that they bear each other's burdens-and they do so; but, by compulsion commonly! If it were done in loving obedience the THOUSAND YEARS were come. This is really a fact worth a consideration. God's laws will have acceptance of joyous love, or else, of miserable, whining helplessness. The world shall not escape them.</p> 
                  <p>Moderate as their success was, Kit and Jenny nevertheless looked upon their fortune as made from the first night that they counted their earnings. Some good ground they had for their belief. Was it not in themselves, and of themselves? They were better fed and better clad from the proceeds of their labor than they had ever been before; and by-and-by they were able to remove from their attic stair to a little room in a better neighborhood. Now think of that; how they were prospering! they had attained unto a room that had a door to it.</p> 
                  <p>The noisiest and busiest thoroughfares of the city were not those taken in their round; for Kit had marked out their beat; it was as clearly defined to<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6043-00000150"/> her as the way of the new rail is to the speculator. According to her expectation it happened to her. They became ere long familiar objects in the streets they frequented-at certain hours, on certain days, children were on the lookout for them. So was an old woman who seemed to live alone in the uppermost story of a high house, and she was always by the window. Kit knew her, and the children, and the shopkeepers, by heart. Nothing escaped her notice. How wise she was in management of the field and forces!</p> 
                  <p>Never did a kind soul express sympathy for their condition, and Kit forgot the face or voice; from no window did tribute ever drop, and she forgot the number. She knew when to laugh and joke with her audience-where coquetry would tell; where dignity was best.</p> 
                  <p>And while they labored thus, and reaped labor's rewards, Kit never reposed an instant in the prosperity of the present; one prospect was ever brightening before her eyes-the glorious country, and the tramp through it, reserved for the spring-time and summer.</p> 
                  <p>Sometimes when this thought became too great for her, she spoke of it in by-ways to Jenny; but it was never the direct theme of their conversations; she kept it in reserve, it seemed, for high occasions: as the fine lady reserves her smiles and diamonds-as my lady's maid her ribands-as the rising man the insults folks in general conspire to fling upon him-as the worldly man his conscience; nay, better, as the lover keeps the royal secret that breaks from him, now in hopes, and now in fears, in much speech, or in little, in gifts, sometimes in sacrifices-but at last in full confession.</p> 
                  <p>One morning they sat on the stone step of a church-it was Sunday-and they listened to the music as it rose from the organ and voices within.</p> 
                  <p>As Kit looked round her on the bright winter morning, on the tree-branches festooned with snow wreaths, and felt the sunlight which was fast dispelling them, her heart filled with rapture, and forgetful of the impediment that hindered Jenny from sharing it, she said, softly, as if to subdue feelings which needed no subduing to a more moderate degree, in order to bring them within the bounds of reasonable comfort:-</p> 
                  <p>"Wait, just wait till you see the country, me dear." And then as she turned her vision-laden eyes to Jenny, pierced to the heart by her thoughtlessness, she added:-</p> 
                  <p>"Do you know now, what I mean by the country, dear?"</p> 
                  <p>Jenny shook her head and answered, "No."</p> 
                  <p>Kit was silent a moment; but in that moment she gathered up herself for speech, wide she flung her arms, and the speaker within who told his sleeping congregation about the love of God, and the heavenliness<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6043-00000151"/> liness of Heaven, had in his face, just then and there, no more glowing witness of his faith and joy, than had the face of Kit, who preached outside to Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"It's to go and sit in the grass, softer nor that in the park; and not the first sound of a wagon to distract ye. Still-still-still as it's here-only beautifuller. It's to look up, and up, and up, and ne'er the sign of a house-top, nor nothing to come between ye. It's to be like a saint all the while, like what you are, Jenny! to be that outside and inside, allers. Now you know what it is; it could make me like yees-for I know, dear, I should be good there. I was gooder over the river-beyant-than I ever was here." Then she patted her listener on the back, and rose above her emotion. "Don't you ever be a-thinking Kit stingy agin: she's savin' the money to take us away into the country, the spring-that's why, me dear."</p> 
                  <p>"Kit," broke in Jenny, determined to be heard, fearful lest something should prevent her, by the rapid way she spoke: "I never thought you was stingy."</p> 
                  <p>"Didn't ye, dear?" said Kit soothingly; for Jenny took Kit's implied self-slander as a personal affront. "Well, don't. Ye might have. I'm allers for getting ye things ye know, and allers not doin' it-ye might have. <emph>I'll</emph> make ye see the country! How you'll love it though, when we get there. You'll see it by feeling. As ye feel that ere singing in there. As ye feel when we go through the park-by the fountain, wid the trees all round, and the grass, and the sun. But it'll be stiller, nor when we sit down beyant on the bench by the fountain. Oh! it's worth living, to live in the country, it is!"</p> 
                  <p>"Kit," said the blind girl in a whisper, and she crept nearer to Kit, who passed her arm gently and protectingly round the slight figure, and asked-</p> 
                  <p>"Are ye cold, honey?"</p> 
                  <p>"No; but Kit, what you said about the country-is that what the gentleman meant about New Jerusalem?"</p> 
                  <p>"What gentleman?"</p> 
                  <p>"The one that talked when I went to the church."</p> 
                  <p>"What did he say, dear?"</p> 
                  <p>"It was about gold streets, and people walking about in 'em in beautiful white dresses-and no night there-but all daytime."</p> 
                  <p>"We had nights out there where I was. I've reason to remember by the good bed, faith," laughed Kit. "I didn't see no white dress though-yees one. Yees it was beautiful. There wasn't no streets-walks about. But I've walked through Gold street meself, dear; it wasn't so terrible grand. Where did he tell that ere place was?"</p> 
                  <p>"New Jerusalem, he said. I remembered it-I used to say it over and over when you was away; I<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6043-00000152"/> thought you'd come back, and maybe we'd go there some day. But then I forgot till you told about the country just now."</p> 
                  <p>"You're a witch for sure," said Kit, laughing. "I was a-thinking of the country when ye tried to remember; the same minit, I'll bet. Don't forget the name, I'd as lief go there as anywhere, when we start."</p> 
                  <p>"They be all good people there," said Jenny musing.</p> 
                  <p>"Be they, though?" asked Kit, evidently in some doubt.</p> 
                  <p>"That's what he said," said Jenny thoughtfully.</p> 
                  <p>"He did! maybe he didn't know everything."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, but he said it was so! and I think he must know, Kit; he said he knew."</p> 
                  <p>"Did he say he'd been there?" asked Kit, really for information.</p> 
                  <p>"He said he knew."</p> 
                  <p>"Well, we'll see for ourselves, Jenny: now we'll be off. They are a-coming out. Them streets of gold must shine though-if they ain't bogus like that gold street down there."</p> 
                  <p>"What's bogus?" asked Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Bogus? it's that pewter shilling the fellow gave us," said Kit. "It's all bogus round here-maybe; but the country's the place, Jenny; there ain't no picking of crumbs out o' slop-troughs there. And when you breathe you'll feel as if you wasn't good enough, but it'll come natural after a while, and by that token you'll know you're getting gooder, me dear. Come! we must get along out of the way."</p> 
                  <p>Did not Kit "know her place?" she took herself out of your way.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE WEAVERS.</head> 
                  <p>LATE in the winter, when the snow had disappeared, and occasional mild days reminded that the spring approached, the summer prospect began to brighten in Kit's and Jenny's thoughts. The people in the country saw as yet brown fields, and frozen brooks, and leaden skies; but before the eyes of the wandering street-singers were constant visions, deepening evermore in radiance, and verdure, which tropical reality might scarcely realize. Day by day the orphans hailed the coming day of their departure-and their talk generally ran in the direction of their hope.</p> 
                  <p>One dark, rainy afternoon when they were playing their liveliest tunes, for it was Kit's policy to reserve such for the darkest days, and so win the thanks and gratitude of people, as well as their money, as they went toward a window which was usually filled with children's faces smiling welcome on them, their progress was arrested by the appearance of an old man who came up a flight of basement steps, and beckoned, and called to them.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"It's my daughter that wants you," he said, answering the questioning look of Kit's bright eyes; so she followed him down the steps, leading Jenny, and taking with her the smile she had ready to throw up to the children.</p> 
                  <p>When they had all gone into the room, and the door was closed the basement seemed quite crowded. For there was the stove, which gave forth a stifling heat, and evil odor; a cot-bed, and another that was made of boxes, old bits of carpet, and a heap of straw, these, with the little table, quite filled the room-one could not make much of himself who lived there-and the tenants and musicians, as we know, were fortunate in being able to make of themselves so little.</p> 
                  <p>She for whom the old man called the singers in, was a young girl-younger than either Kit or Jenny. She was the old fellow's grand-daughter, and her youth was nearer to the grave than his age.</p> 
                  <p>Her figure was so tall, and so emaciated, that it looked above the ordinary height of women; while the childish features seemed, as the body did, unequal to the burden put on them-for they were laden with anxiety, and pain, and care.</p> 
                  <p>But she was at work. Her lap, and hands, and arms, were full. Weaving, and coughing, and dying, there she was-born, one would think, to endure suffering, and want-and dying, who could tell for what? For myself I have sometimes laughed to<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6043-00000154"/> think of that old body to whom heaven was a clean check apron, and a hymn-book. But I can laugh no more. God be thanked for that beautiful vision of Rest that won the faith of the poor child of poverty and pain!</p> 
                  <p>The girl half rose when Kit entered the room, but she instantly sat again, and the smile that greeted the singers was so fleeting and sad, one never could have been quite sure that it was a smile. She sat down coughing violently, so that, for a few minutes, she could neither speak, nor, which seemed to be the more important thing of the two, go on with her work.</p> 
                  <p>Meanwhile the old man perceiving this, for nothing concerning his grand-child escaped the notice of his poor old eyes, drew a box near the stove, and bade Kit and Jenny sit and warm themselves.</p> 
                  <p>"She's poorly to-day," said he, looking anxiously toward his child, while with his trembling hands he stirred the fire. "She's heard you sing in the streets, Jane has. She likes your tunes. I called after you the last time you was our way, but you didn't hear. Sing up cheery now, for Jane. Make her lively if you can, girls. I'll pay you for it."</p> 
                  <p>Kit, to whom he looked while he was speaking, rose without a word, and took her stand beside the organ: "'Old folks at home' first," said she to Jenny-and they sang.</p> 
                  <p>The sick girl listened and forgot her pain, and her work, both; the old man watchful of her, saw the pleased and cheerful expression of her wasted face, and smiled in his own delight.</p> 
                  <p>"But hear her sing without me," said Kit, perceiving the hearty appreciation, "the organ is too loud for the room. Sing alone, Jenny;" and oh, the loving pride, the deep satisfaction with which Kit listened, and noticed the effect of Jenny's song!</p> 
                  <p>"Blind?" asked the old man.</p> 
                  <p>Kit bowed.</p> 
                  <p>"That's life too," returned he in another tone, as if talking by himself, and he rubbed his withered hands together; then he took up the mat that he was weaving, again, and busied himself with it.</p> 
                  <p>Kit looked at his furrowed face, white hair, and wretched garments; and she said to herself sadly, "Poor old man!" and she felt all the weight of his heavy burden? but her attention was drawn away from him by the voice of Jane, who was trying to express her thanks to Jenny for her songs. Perhaps you have a friend whose friendship does you honor. We will appreciate Kit's joy together then. I see the people crowning the woman whom I love.</p> 
                  <p>When they were about to go the old man offered them money. He was afraid she would not take it, they were so very poor; it was this that made him look so anxious when he offered it; but Kit did not understand the fear in his face-she mistook it-and she promptly declined the pay. She thought she<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6043-00000155"/> could better afford the time they had given, than he his pence. But he said, expostulating-</p> 
                  <p>"I want you to come every day; and you live by your trade, don't you? I've got money to spare-lots of it-and it pleases Jane to hear you. Lots of cash, but I ain't afeard of robbers. He! he! what are you standing off for? Come! take your pay, or I'll be getting somebody else to sing for Jane."</p> 
                  <p>Kit looked at Jenny; she thought of the country, and she took the money.</p> 
                  <p>"Every day, remember," the old man called after them.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," they answered together; and so departed.</p> 
                  <p>"Was it a poor place?" asked Jenny of Kit when they walked again along the pavement.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Kit, and then they both sighed, and doubtless the children in the window felt the disheartening effect of this underground visit the singers had made; but if they did, it was explained to them that Kit and Jenny could not <emph>always</emph> be expected to live down the influences of cloudy weather, more than other folks; and this explanation will account for the fact that as Kit took up her organ to go from the window, a shower of pence rewarded them such as had never descended before, from that, or any other window, on them.</p> 
                  <p>And now, every day, through storm and sunshine, the two girls found their way into the weaver's room. If the weather was fine, they took their stand on the sidewalk above, and played and sang together, but besides this, they generally went in, and then Jenny invariably sang alone for Jane.</p> 
                  <p>Often, so often that it could not have been accidentally on the part of the entertainers, the singers found them at a late dinner, or an early tea, and when this was the case, there was no escaping their solicitations to sit down and share the meal.</p> 
                  <p>The failing health of Jane was matter of open comment. It was not, as in better homes, where fond hearts cheat each other, and strive together against Death, as against a mighty foe, but never name his name. The old man talked about it-so did Kit and Jenny-so did Jane. Yet, even so far through the disease as to that stage where the singers found her, both Jane and the old man had entertained some hope of her recovery. And when Kit revealed to them her country project, they talked about the possibility of joining her and Jenny in their rambles.</p> 
                  <p>The country was not so strange to them. The old man spent the first half of his life there; and Jane remembered the year when they came up to the city. It had never crossed her thoughts that return from thence was possible. Of herself she never might have wished it; for in the first home, even as in the last, utter poverty had been her portion; she knew no other lot. She had no imaginations-she had no anticipations-life was only to work, and eat, and sleep a little, and the less the better. Do you estimate the<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6043-00000156"/> difference between a voluntary and necessitated self-denial? Can you appreciate the distinction?</p> 
                  <p>But when Kit came with her fancies and her hopes, it was different with Jane. She too began to look back with longing eyes-to think of the sweet air, the warm and pleasant sunlight-the great heaven, and green earth, the birds, and flowers-the running streams-the quiet, and the rest, the blessed rest.</p> 
                  <p>But the winter hung on long; it seemed as if the cold winds never would have done, nor the rain; they waited, and looked, and listened, and longed-would she never come? How could the Spring trifle so, raising expectations only to destroy them?</p> 
                  <p>Alas! when she did actually come at last, with bud, and blossom, and warm smiles, and gentle breath, rich as an Indian bride, Jane was in no condition to travel with her into the land of poor Kit's dreams.</p>

                  <head type="sub">JENNY'S PRAYER.</head> 
                  <p>DURING the spring some change had taken place in the singers' way of life.</p> 
                  <p>They had made a removal from the little room they occupied, to another next the basement occupied by the old man and Jane. They did not now, as formerly, go out into the streets on all days, in all weather. Jenny learned to weave, and in the evenings she and Kit worked on the mats with Jane and her grandfather; they did so likewise on stormy days when they stayed under shelter. Even in fine weather Kit not unfrequently went out alone, or accompanied the old man in his rounds, leaving Jane and Jenny together in the basement.</p> 
                  <p>Strange were the themes of conversation, on which these young girls sometimes ventured, when thus left to themselves-the dying, and the blind girl. Almost as wonderful to Jenny was the project which she and Kit kept ever before them-frequent discussion could not make it familiar-as that to which the consumptive looked forward.</p> 
                  <p>One day when they were alone Jenny said to the<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6043-00000157"/> invalid suddenly, after long pondering on a remark dropped by her as she wearily continued her labor:-</p> 
                  <p>"You say you are going away soon. Going to die-what is that, Jane? I know some children once who used to play with me. They stopped coming to the stair after awhile, and I heard that they were dead. They went away somewhere, and after that we never heard of them. Where did they go, Jane?"</p> 
                  <p>It was some time before Jane answered this question.</p> 
                  <p>"I'll tell you all I know about it," she said slowly at length. "Everybody goes away, as you call it-gets dead. One thing and another carries 'em off. Fever, or a hurt, or a cough, or something. I used to be a strong girl-you wouldn't believe it-but you could no more have carried me in your arms, than you could a lamp-post. But you could do it now, easy-and you ain't so very strong. It's the cough. We've tried our best to stop it; but bless you there's no such thing. Grandfather has paid oceans of money for it. He's almost killed himself of sitting up nights and working, and tramping about days to sell, for to get money for medicines. It come awful hard; but I was willing, for I thought I'd pay him back for it, over and over. Everything we tried seemed to do good for a little while, though I've been getting worse, all the time. I've stopped taking anything now. Where's the good? He puts the bottles here by me when he goes out, I expect he thinks I take 'em; but if I took the stuff, he'd buy more, you know; and it's nothing but throwing money in the street. I'm a dying-that's what they call it-every day more and more so. Pretty soon it will all be over-and when you speak to me there won't be no answer-then I'll be buried.... And what'll become of <emph>him</emph> then, if you and Kit forsake him? It's what I'd work my fingers to the bone for, to keep him from the poor-house.... What do you suppose sent you here, you two, so cheerful and pleasant, to such a dismal hole as this? Though, to be sure, for the fortune, you may be poor enough."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh! we came in first, you know, because he called us back," said Jenny, answering the question that was asked, but not the thought in the head of the questioner.</p> 
                  <p>"Are you going to leave my father, then? that's what I want to know?" asked Jane.</p> 
                  <p>"Kit never will if you speak the word," said Jenny confidently. "'Tisn't in her. She.... Where is it you are going to? Can you see? Does anybody know? Oh, if I could open my eyes for a minute!" Jenny was more eager in this questioning than Jane had been in hers. Somewhat soothed by the answer given to her fear, Jane answered:-</p> 
                  <p>"What good would that do? it's as though we shut our eyes and jumped. Nobody knows."</p> 
                  <p>"Ain't you afraid?" asked Jenny in a low, awed whisper.</p> 
                  <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6043-00000158"/> 
                  <p>"Afraid of what?" said Jane.</p> 
                  <p>But though her words seemed to assert her courage, she drew her chair nearer to the box on which Jenny sat, and leaned forward, spreading her thin hands above the stove, looking down with solemn face upon the blind girl.</p> 
                  <p>"It's only what goes on every day," she continued. "I don't know as I am. I saw my brother; he died here on that bed, he was asleep-had never waked up: it seemed pleasant for him, and he looked comfortable."</p> 
                  <p>"Here, after he was gone?" asked Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Jane. And this question of Jenny seemed to place the matter in some new light before her mind. "We buried him out to Greenwood-in the green wood, think of that! I wish you could see it-father and I have been there twice; it's a long way off: I was dreadful tired the last time. Oh, it's so beautiful and still. To think of <emph>my</emph> lying down there to rest, in such a place as that!"</p> 
                  <p>"Is it there always that you stay? Don't you wake up? What happens? or don't nothing happen? What was it that I heard?"</p> 
                  <p>A long silence followed the question, but at length reluctantly, though with awful solemnity, Jane spoke the answer she had found for herself in her own silent questioning upon these things.</p> 
                  <p>"After my brother died I used to go sometimes to a church not far off, and I heard there what becomes of us. I tried to believe it. It seemed worth believing; and there ain't nothing else for us. They say that people, good people, go, after they're dead, from this world to another, and there we have another father to take care of us, if we're good, you know."</p> 
                  <p>"And he's the one they ask for things," broke in Jenny eagerly.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Jane with increasing confidence; for in the glowing face of Jenny she seemed to read an assurance which no words of the blind girl could give.</p> 
                  <p>"And it's there we shall be angels and with the angels, and have wings. Oh, Jenny! sometimes but for the poor old man I would have cried out to be took, I've suffered so. He was always kind-but, if I'd had a mother to take care of me-but no matter, now I'm going; maybe it's what you are here for. If he is our Father, as they say, perhaps He sent you here." Jenny heard this troubled, this impassioned voice, but she could not see the agony of earnestness with which Jane watched her face.</p> 
                  <p>"They said to the church that day I was in, that if anybody asked Him, they'd get their wish," said Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you ever ask?" said Jane.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," answered Jenny softly.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you get your wish? I know you did!"</p> 
                  <p>"That's the truth, Jane; I did so."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you keep on asking then?"</p> 
                  <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6043-00000159"/> 
                  <p>"No indeed, Jane. Kit and I don't live by begging now; we work." Jenny drew up her slight figure, and her cheek flushed, as she made this proud reply.</p> 
                  <p>"What was it that you asked?"</p> 
                  <p>"I'll tell you, but I never told afore," said Jenny with generous confidence. "It was afore Kit came back. I prayed she might be kept from harm; and so she was. I prayed she might come back; and so she did. That He'd help us-and hasn't He? I believe in the Father Almighty-that's what they said in the church out loud together; I never shall forget; and so I've said to myself, often and often I've said this here to myself, Jane, if I had a father, like some of the children I've heard talking to the gentlemen when we've played for 'em at the door, he'd gin me what I asked for, just as they do-and <emph>that's</emph> the way I come to ask."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Jenny!" cried Jane, "if you're so sure of it, ask Him for me-ask Him to make me ready to go, for maybe I ain't ready-ask Him to take me. Beg, Jenny, beg; I ain't too proud to be begged for."</p> 
                  <p>"Do you see anything with <emph>your</emph> eyes?" asked Jenny in a whisper, reaching forth her hands, her face brightening, and uplifting. "Is the room as it was? for I think He is here; wait, I'll ask Him," and the blind girl bowed her head in the homage of adoration, and besought the Present God for Jane.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE GREENWOOD.</head> 
                  <p>SOONER than they anticipated the prayer was heard and answered.</p> 
                  <p>Even while it was ascending, the long suffering one for whom it was offered, sunk into a slumber that had no conscious waking. Jenny was still sitting on the box, in the place where they left her, when the old man and Kit came home. Her work had fallen from her hands, her head bent resting on her knee.</p> 
                  <p>It was dark in the basement-profoundly silent there. The fire in the stove had gone out; dark, silent, and cold. Kit lighted the fire and the candle, while the old man laid aside his dripping coat, for the rain was falling heavily, and they walked about quietly, and spoke in whispers to each other, that the sleep of Jane and Jenny might not be broken. But presently, with some misgiving, sleep at this hour is to his thinking an event so very strange, the old man bends over the child, so long the object of his anxious care-and then he calls in a loud voice for Kit to bring a light, and he lifts the poor unconscious head, and sees her bosom wet and stained with her life-blood<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6043-00000160"/> blood-and he staggers with the weight of the body which he bears to the bed, so that he himself falls upon it, when he would lay her gently there. But she stirs not.</p> 
                  <p>Once or twice there is a heavily-drawn breath that breaks upon his ear, but nothing more. The old man has lost his child then. Yes. His dim and bloodshot eyes look down upon her youthful face, and he is slow to lay to heart the pleasant thought that she is free now-free for ever from discomfort, toil, and pain.</p> 
                  <p>Kit stands near him with the candle-nerved as if for some great struggle-but what's the service she can render here? She meditates on death as a young warrior might confront his foe-eyes fixed, lips firm, and face unblenching; but there's nothing she can do, even Kit, whom no difficulty daunts, nothing-nothing here.</p> 
                  <p>Jenny, with her hand on the cold hand of Jane, beholds a winged spirit in the place filled to those other watchers by a slender form of clay, and she arrays the angel with that smile, that grace and beauty, with which poor Kit stands evermore adorned before her loving heart.</p> 
                  <p>One day later Kit made her second journey to the country. The little family went out to bury Jane.</p> 
                  <p>It was a mild and quiet afternoon; not bright, but lifeless, full of gloom. The old man had determined to go on foot and alone to the burial, or, in case the weather did not allow, to take his place in the wagon of the person he had engaged to carry the body of Jane; but when Kit went into the basement, and saw his trembling hands fastening the coffin-lid, making the few preparations needful for burying his treasure, she said-</p> 
                  <p>"I thought maybe you'd wait till the day cleared up some."</p> 
                  <p>"Won't be any clearer till it rains," he answered, without lifting his eyes to her.</p> 
                  <p>"Then I'll have Jenny ready in a minute," said Kit, quite cheerfully.</p> 
                  <p>The old man laid the hammer down, and looked at Kit.</p> 
                  <p>"What for?" said he.</p> 
                  <p>"To go in the carriage."</p> 
                  <p>"What carriage?" he repeated in dismay.</p> 
                  <p>"To Jane's funeral," she explained.</p> 
                  <p>The old man surveyed her a moment in silence.</p> 
                  <p>"Kit," said he, "I haven't got a cent in the world for a carriage; I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I haven't."</p> 
                  <p>"But I have," said Kit, "and Jenny's heart is set on going. Wouldn't it be a shame now, you to be refusin'? Wait till I get her ready, grandpa, and I'll take care o' things."</p> 
                  <p>These words were not fairly spoken when Kit darted from the room; it seemed but a moment when she came again leading Jenny, and bearing in her hand,<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6043-00000161"/> open as the day, the better part of that silver treasure gathered for the summer journey. As she came into the room and hastened to the outer door of the basement, the old man followed her and arrested her swift steps.</p> 
                  <p>"It isn't so terrible far," said he. "<emph>You</emph> could walk it with me, but <emph>she</emph> couldn't. I'll mark the spot some way, and you can find it afterward. Don't mind about the carriage to-day; we'll go up when the times ain't so hard-after I've picked up a little. I wouldn't object, but these drivers won't wait; they want the money down for funerals."</p> 
                  <p>"We want to go, grandpa; I do, and so does Jenny," persisted Kit, "and we can't walk. We've got to ride. See here, now, ain't my money your money, and your'n mine? We're going to be what Jane was, so let me go."</p> 
                  <p>Slowly the old man withdrew his hand; Kit did not wait to hear the consenting words on his lips, but hurried out, and away, breathless, to a carriage-stand, and she hired a carriage and a hearse. Kit had many a time seen that funereal car going down the street, toward the various places of sepulture-and though securing it made her a bankrupt, Jane should be buried decently. Poor Jane! there has been many another greater, as we say, than she, honored, for the first time, in death and burial.</p> 
                  <p>It was not an hour later that these vehicles were added to the number that jostled over the crowded pavement. It was the poorest, craziest carriage to be found on any stand-that carriage in which they rode:-Kit gave the driver the contents of the rag in which she tied her treasure, for his services, and he promised to take the company of mourners to the cemetery for it-they would walk home.</p> 
                  <p>Opposite the old man, to whom, in deference to his bereavement, the girls gave up the whole of the back seat, opposite him Kit and Jenny sat side by side, and hand in hand. For once lifted above the rushing tide of life, and sheltered from though borne along with it. And the hearse went before them. A little while Kit's attention was distracted by the novelty of her position; it was strange, from this new point of view, to see the people on the sidewalk, the hurrying men crazed with calculations, and handsome women mad with vanity; the old creatures at their various stands, old women and old men; the beggars, and street-sweepers, and newsboys: then the stages, and the carts, the carriages, and drays, the horsemen, filling the pavement to overflowing; foot-passengers darting to and fro among the horses' heads; the noise, and the activity; these things were daily sights to Kit, but from the carriage they presented a picture to her eyes such as she had never seen before. She forgot Jane in the hearse, and the old man opposite her, and Jenny by her side, and leaned against the window, and gazed, and gazed, and gazed. But, as at length she started from one side of the carriage to<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6043-00000162"/> the other, to watch the people in the park, her eyes fell on the old mourner opposite, and she sat down suddenly, confounded at herself, and overwhelmed with shame. Along the wrinkles of his face broken tears were glistening; they had fallen and broken unheeded by him.</p> 
                  <p>Struck with sudden remorse she sat down and closed her eyes; endured the silence as long as it was possible; then she threw herself forward, it was time that she should speak, because she could not now be still.</p> 
                  <p>"Don't feel so-don't-you've got two left-you have, me and Jenny," she said to the mourner.</p> 
                  <p>Though the old man did not look at her, and gave no intimation that he heard, Kit, having so spoken, returned to her place beside Jenny, firm in the purpose she had declared, and in the conviction that he would be consoled by her assurance. She held Jenny's hand in hers, and the excitement she had felt, gradually disappeared-the fantastic and pictorial effect of all she looked at had quite vanished from the scenes through which they passed-she returned to her cares, and calculations, and to solemn thoughts of Jane.</p> 
                  <p>Her imagination rallied, however, when they drove down to the boat, and in upon its gangway; nothing that her eyes met escaped her there, and she said in a whisper to Jenny, as the bell of the ferry-boat rang, and the steamer moved off slowly from the wharf-</p> 
                   
                  <p>"Now, me dear, ye may think ye're out on the great say-sailing off in the vessel to foreign parts across the mighty ocean." And Jenny whispered in answer:-</p> 
                  <p>"Yes, I will, Kit. It's beautiful! Is Jane here with us, too?"</p> 
                  <p>"All aboard!" said Kit, "to the fore, she is;" and she looked from the carriage-window, taking a long survey of her surroundings, as she did so, but she thought she was only looking for Jane.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you see her?" asked Jenny, as if in some way aware that Kit had been making an observation.</p> 
                  <p>"No, but she's around; she's somewhere," answered Kit.</p> 
                  <p>"In a carriage like us? Why didn't we bring her? wasn't there room here, Kit?"</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-room, lots of it. But-but-it's best she should ride alone, you know-that's the way they allers do it. She's in a carriage like us-it's not quite like though. Hern is all fixed off wid black, and looks solemn-so you feel queer to look at it."</p> 
                  <p>Jenny folded her hands as she listened, and seemed quite content with this description; "solemn" and "queer" she felt, though blind, for Kit's eyes were like eyes to her.</p> 
                  <p>In the city of graves that overlooks the sea, grave place so magnificent that Jane's wondering reception of the thought, that such as she should sleep there, is no occasion of surprise to us, who know the scenery<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6043-00000163"/> on which she, through her life, had gazed, there, though not near the spot where her brother slept, for that space had long ago been filled, they laid her.</p> 
                  <p>We're in the country now," said Kit to Jenny, as they stepped from the carriage to the ground.</p> 
                  <p>"I know it," was the soft and reverent answer, and for the first time the blind girl walked upon the green sward of the country.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you see how still it is? There's a bird up in the tree there, a building of her nest." More delight than sorrow was in the heart of Kit just now-her heart betrayed her-although it was to Jane's burial they had come. They stood just on the spot of ground their feet had pressed when they stepped from the carriage: chained to the spot, it seemed, by the force of new and strange emotions. But the old man was with the grave-digger, standing by Jane's coffin, and the carriage had been driven away.</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Kit!" said Jenny, "is this the country, true? What is it, then-what is it?" Almost distress was in her voice; they were Here at last, and she could neither understand the excited self within, nor the new world without.</p> 
                  <p>"Hush, dear, and I'll tell you," answered Kit in a low tone; but though she spoke with confidence, she was perplexed; how to describe all this glory she beheld, all this which she had trusted Jenny would for herself feel, she knew not.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"What is it?" repeated Jenny, in a lower, but still more eager tone.</p> 
                  <p>"It's the blue sky, away up above us," began Kit-in some trepidation, as she launched upon this theme, yet in reality equal to the occasion as she always was-"blue, but cloudy some; rain to-morrow, maybe; and the trees all around us, everywhere. And hills! and white stones, lots of 'em-some high and elegant-and these are for the gentlemen and ladies; it's the flowers and the grass; and the water over yonder, with vessels sailing up and down, and over."</p> 
                  <p>"Yes," said Jenny quietly, as if altogether satisfied with the account. "What is it we are going to do with Jane?"</p> 
                  <p>"What they do with the great folks-big and little-ah, Jenny! jist the same!" answered Kit, her voice rising, as she hit upon this thought, rising almost to the note of triumph, "put her in the ground, and shut the door up."</p> 
                  <p>"As if it was our house," said Jenny, lifting her head and smiling.</p> 
                  <p>"Jist the same," said Kit; "it <emph>is</emph> ourn."</p> 
                  <p>"She'll be over here, and we'll be over there-two homes."</p> 
                  <p>"That's it!" said Kit. "You hit it, allers. The right nail on the head allers, Jenny."</p> 
                  <p>"She'll be alone mostly-but when we come over," mused Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Yes-no-there's hundreds of 'em here besides<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6043-00000164"/> her; she ain't alone-none of 'em ain't. She's a-going to have a good still time of it."</p> 
                  <p>"She is.... what's that? What was it that fell, Kit?"</p> 
                  <p>"Where, Jenny?"</p> 
                  <p>"There on my foot."</p> 
                  <p>"That! it's only an old leaf blowed along by the wind, dear."</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, Kit! if we could stay here always. Kit"-</p> 
                  <p>"What darling?"</p> 
                  <p>"If I should die-"</p> 
                  <p>"Die! Come on-grandfather is waiting for us-take my hand; we'll go and see about Jane."</p> 
                  <p>"But Kit, if I should-"</p> 
                  <p>"You ain't a-going to die. What would <emph>I</emph> do then?"</p> 
                  <p>"If I <emph>should</emph>, before you, Kit, it's here-"</p> 
                  <p>"I know all about that," said Kit, hurrying her on.</p> 
                  <p>"If you should die first," persisted Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"I sha'n't," returned Kit resolutely. Such a thought had never crossed her mind till now; and now she would not bear it. But from it she could not free herself; with her red, rough hand she dashed away the tears that gathered in her eyes as she looked at Jenny and thought upon herself in that new light: a creature liable to disease and death.</p> 
                  <p>"You might, Kit"-came up from Jenny's voice, like a death-warrant signed and sealed. But again Kit defied it.</p> 
                   
                  <p>"You'll have me by you as long as you have yourself, you will," she said with passionate energy. "Don't be a-saying such things now, dear," she continued, her voice hushed by the rebuke with which the silent place seemed to receive her first words-hushed, to entreaty. "Don't be a saying such things to make me mad; and you mustn't be a-thinking of 'em either."</p>

                  <p>THEY walked back to the city when the burial was over. Notwithstanding Kit's injunction and warning to Jenny, she herself could only think of that awful possibility the blind girl's reflections had brought before her mind. As they went down from the Greenwood she recalled to thought the many of whom she had heard, and those known to her, who had been taken suddenly out of the world by accident, or pestilence. Strength was in her limbs, and she felt equal to any amount of labor, and yet-yet!-she might die at any moment! And what would become of Jenny then? who would take care of the old man? The thought cast a dark gloom over this, Kit's second festival. Jenny could not see it; the old man would think it was on Jane's account, if he observed anything in her face, strange and new; she might let her tears fall, if she would, but she would not. Oh, Loving Heart of the Great Universe! Thou that seest all! didst Thou see poor Kit, didst Thou send an angel to her? for as she went along, leading her child, her Jenny, her courage rose again, the phantom vanished from her sight, the cloud departed without breaking, leaving the heavens clear, and she thought of Life once more, delivered from the bondage of the fear of death.</p> 
                  <p>The expenses of Jane's sickness and funeral, quite exhausted the funds of the old man and Kit. Of the money she had contrived to save during the past months, but a few pence remained after the carriage-hire was paid. No more was now said of the projected country tour. But Kit resolved on an indulgence that should take the place of this-they would buy a plaster cast for the grave of Jane! a monument, the like of those she saw over the graves of many in that cemetery of the poor-that Potter's Field.</p> 
                  <p>This, she said to Jenny, they would take up to Jane some pleasant day; and Kit was paid for all the cost when she saw Jenny's smile in view of the sweet prospect!</p> 
                  <p>And now Kit gave herself no rest. She grew old fast. Early and late she was ever at her work; unawares her mirthfulness was gone. She became wise and sad. Early and late at work, there was no other way for her. The old man's constitution was much broken before his grandchild's death-his life now became constantly more and more a burden to him. As long as she remained he had an object in view that made him unmindful of his own infirmities-her comfort was to be provided for-but when she<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6043-00000166"/> was gone, both motive and strength for exertion were gone also.</p> 
                  <p>He went now but rarely into the streets; and little could he do at home.</p> 
                  <p>So it fell on Kit to stand alone confronting the dark future. And she had not only the courage, but the strength to rise triumphant in, and through, her labors, and make the burden that she bore seem to others trifling and agreeable.</p> 
                  <p>She had thought once of buying the organ and tambourine, but now the prospect was abandoned; she returned the instruments to the Italian, and her heart was heavier than it was that night when she first took them to the stair. The loss of the music was a great loss to her. But Jenny was skilful with her weaving, and the old man was sure that she could make a better living, and an easier, by working in the basement than by roving in the streets. So Kit yielded to his judgment, and in the night herself worked on the mats, and by day she hawked them through the thoroughfares, seeking at door-ways, and in humble by-shops, a market for her wares; and ever she became more diligent-more wise and sad-more wise and sad, poor Kit.</p> 
                  <p>Thus, through the long, hot summer, did they live and labor. But in the midst of the sultriness, and dust, and weariness, they had their glorious high festival even as they dreamed. They bought the plaster image, and walked away with it one morning, to place it on Jane's grave. Do you ask how, amid the multitude of mounds, they recognised the one that belonged to them? Perhaps they did not recognise it; but the image, nevertheless, became the headstone of a grave-and what though another than Jane slept under it? It was still Jane's monument-a pillar to her memory.</p> 
                  <p>For hours they lingered in the lovely place; they spent the hot noontide, and later hours, in that cool and green retreat! It was a garden of delight to them. Sitting to rest on the grassy banks beneath the willow trees; wandering along the margin of the pond where the fountain played, or walking up and down the shady paths, or pausing before some fine monument, breathless with delight, the hours went on. There, under a cloudless sky, they strayed; through the balmy green avenues, beggars both-blind both, as you might say. Amid the many monuments of art they stood, amid the sweetness of the solitude, which still were solitude, although the city's stream of life poured through its paths-and not the splendor of the day gave truer evidence of love, than the watchful care those sisters of want bestowed, by act and thought, upon each other: not an elaborate monument of all in the Greenwood, gave better evidence of true faithfulness and hope, mid want and grief, than the heart of Kit gave to Him who sees the Heart.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
                  <head type="sub">THE GOSPEL AND THE POOR.</head> 
                  <p>THERE are some people who scoff when you talk of the laws of Nature-they merely rail at Providence. Kit was not of these; but she was ignorant; there was no one to warn her, and tell her that certain causes must produce certain effects. No one to say to her that the damp basement in which they lived would finally prove a fatal dwelling-place, to, at least, one of them; no one to open for them the door of another home-to tell her that labor, day after day, in the dark, dismal cellar, was acting ruinously on Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>Kit did perceive that Jenny grew thin as she grew tall, and that her face, always pale, was changing in its hue; that labor wearied her as it did not once. She saw this, and asked herself why it was so, and what was to be done? With many a foreboding she asked it, taking counsel of herself, and trying to find an answer that would rebuke her fears. If it were not for the old man .... but, there he was, and their fortune was his, and Kit felt guilty of a shameful sin that she should dare to speculate on the good that might result if he were but out of the way. But, if Jenny could only be with her again, as she was once-night and day with her!-perhaps it was the stir of the streets the poor child missed-the hurry and noise and excitement; it might be that living so much alone with the old man made Jenny sad and silent-and if he were not there! But when Kit desperately resorted to the remedy, the sole remedy of which she knew, its futility appeared; not only did the old man's complaint, on being left alone, put a stop to these new wanderings-Jenny's strength was not long equal to them.</p> 
                  <p>The last time the experiment was made, Kit returned with Jenny before noon to the basement. It was the only time her tears had fallen since her first startled observation of the change that was taking place in her child. Bitterly, passionately those tears now fell.</p> 
                  <p>A care, of which she had not endured to think, was now upon her, demanding more than watchfulness and toil; even the heavier sacrifice of love and fear and grief. But she was also equal to this new demand; and fear and grief gave to Jenny only their tenderest tokens, the continual evidences of faithful love. Brain and heart, as well as hands, were taxed to their uttermost to bring the blind girl ease of body, and cheerfulness of mind. And the old man's garrulity and childishness served our hero here; since the death of Jane he had lived almost entirely in the past-his youth had know some sport and happiness<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6043-00000168"/> -a brighter sky hung over it, and to hear of it was to listen, Jenny thought, to a sweet fairy tale. So she went often with the old man into the woods of youth; the squirrels and the birds were there; brooks, long grass, wild flowers, and mandrakes, that were fragrant and golden. She climbed with him the autumn trees, and gathered nuts and apples. She rode on his swift sled down the steep hills of snow, and dashed among the skaters over fields of ice. She went into the country, with an old, childish man, through whose gray hairs the winter wind sighed, freezing; and Kit sometimes listened with her, if the old man chanced to be wakeful by night; and she could so far forget the anguish of the present, as to laugh when Jenny laughed, and say, with her, that it was beautiful, and very strange, to be sure. But oh, that laughter!</p> 
                  <p>Sunday had always been the girls' holyday; but it ceased to be so long before the summer ended. Kit had no time for rest; day after day, day after day, from morning until night, and sometimes from night nearly till morning, her labors went on, and Jenny was ever growing feebler, so that had Kit found the time for leisure, her darling had not now the strength for its enjoyment.</p> 
                  <p>The disease which had been years in undermining Jane's strong constitution, carried Jenny away in fewer months. But the consumption wasted without' a cough, by its fearful fever, and that was one reason why poor Kit was, in spite of all her fears and forebodings, never actually prepared for that which came.</p> 
                  <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/> 
                  <p>Only a short time before Jenny's death Kit's heart glowed for a moment with the greatest hope that it had ever known.</p> 
                  <p>One Sabbath-day they had strolled into one of the streets as far as the door of the church to which they had at other times been attracted by the music. They went farther than the door this day, for when Kit looked within, and saw there was no crowd there, she led Jenny along noiselessly across the porch, and they sat down together on a bench just within the door.</p> 
                  <p>There, when the singing was ended, they still remained. To rest, rather than listen. Yet what listeners did they prove! The text from which the minister spoke was this: "<emph>Whereas I was blind, now I see</emph>." It was a theme on which the dullest of speakers, occupying that stand, could not have spoken without finding at least two rapt listeners. And this speaker was not dull. Kit, it is true, hardly looked at him once while he delivered his discourse; but not a word he uttered escaped her hearing, as she sat and gazed with ever-strengthening resolution on Jenny's changeful face.</p> 
                  <p>When the people were dismissed with the benediction, this resolution struggled to make an exhibition<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6043-00000169"/> of itself. And it made good its opportunity; but, alas, for the opportunity-a barren thing it was!</p> 
                  <p>Withdrawing with Jenny into the corner of the church farthest from the aisle, she waited there until the congregation had passed out, then leading the blind girl into the sun she said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Kit's going to leave ye here for a minute, dear. Will ye wait?"</p> 
                  <p>"Go on," said Jenny; and Kit was off like a flash.</p> 
                  <p>With hurried step she darted into the broad aisle of the church down which the people had just passed. Up to the chancel, within it, beyond it. She had, during the sermon, made sure, by her attentive observation, of the door through which the clergyman had come into the church, by which he had passed out again; him she followed, for she would know if he had spoken truth that day-if indeed the blind received their sight, and where, and of whom she might seek this priceless boon for Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>But the clergyman had gone.</p> 
                  <p>For a moment after Kit had assured herself of this fact she walked about the room, and spoke aloud, thinking, maybe, if he were near he would hear her, and come. All she had to say was ready on her lip-she should not be afraid to ask him-he looked kind, and then his voice had something in it, when he read the prayers, that made her confident. But, he did not hear, he did not come; and Kit-convinced only after repeated endeavors that he did not and could not hear, that he was gone-went out through the church, into the porch again, with a slower step and heavier.</p> 
                  <p>Hearing that well-known and beloved step, the blind girl rose, and smiled, and stretched her hand out to Kit who, taking it, commended her in her own rough, kind way, for patient waiting; but the smile faded again in an instant from Jenny's face, and she said:-</p> 
                  <p>"Kit, they sing better in there, than we used to in the streets."</p> 
                  <p>"<emph>Some</emph>," said Kit emphatically.</p> 
                  <p>"Did you hear what it was about, Kit?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," answered she impatiently; "how could I? all jumbled up so, faith! till they wasn't no words-but jist a confushion. When we singed, folks knew what we were afther saying."</p> 
                  <p>"There was one bit I got though, Kit-my ears was always better than yours," said Jenny smiling-but the smile was sad.</p> 
                  <p>"What did you git?"</p> 
                  <p>"Something about 'rest to your souls,' and 'come unto me,' didn't you get that now?"</p> 
                  <p>"Well, maybe," acknowledged Kit reluctantly-she was giving way at that moment, and but for that moment, to some bitter thoughts-the disappointment of the great momentary hope she cherished was so<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6043-00000170"/> deep a grief to her. "What of it?" said she quickly, repenting her peevishness.</p> 
                  <p>"It had a dear sound," said Jenny.</p> 
                  <p>"Why?" asked Kit in sudden and jealous fear.</p> 
                  <p>Jenny did not answer that question directly, but presently she asked another.</p> 
                  <p>"Kit," said she, "did you hear what the gentleman said?"</p> 
                  <p>"Some of it," answered Kit carelessly, yawning.</p> 
                  <p>"About the blind getting their sight; receiving it; having it given to 'em," Jenny resumed, timidly, after a short pause; Kit seemed so little interested; and yet it was so great a thought to her she could not choose but utter it.</p> 
                  <p>"Read you mean; he read it out of a big book," returned Kit, still pretending indifference.</p> 
                  <p>"Do you believe it's all true?"</p> 
                  <p>"Oh, maybe so! Maybe 'tis; maybe not. It happened a long while ago, anyway; as all the wonderful things did. Nothing happens now surprising dear."</p> 
                  <p>"It sounded true-like, to me," said Jenny-laughing a little as she acknowledged this-laughing at her own foolishness. "'Cause I'd like to have it true, I expect." But so untrue to herself as she was in this speaking, she could no longer than a moment be. "Oh, Kit!" she cried, "if there was somebody <emph>I</emph> could go to, like those folks he told of!"</p> 
                   
                  <p>"I've thought ye better off, many and many's the time," exclaimed Kit in a well-sustained tone of passionate reproach. "Better off I say, 'cause ye couldn't see! It isn't nothing that ye've lost. Ye're enough sight better off than folks that can see. Don't go to fretting, don't distract me."</p> 
                  <p>"But Kit, I'd be off your hands then. I ain't fretting for myself. Wouldn't you be willing to be at liberty? Couldn't the old man and I go over to the river, and stay to the big house you talked about, so pleasant? We'd be together, and you could take a journey to see us in the country, every Sunday. We should expect you every Sunday, Kit. He wouldn't mind about going, if I went with him. Kit you're not as happy as you was. You don't sing now-you have to work so hard; and strangers on your hands to work for, so-not the first bit of-"</p> 
                  <p>Here Kit closed the speaker's mouth with her broad hand. For a moment she struggled in vain to speak, and when her voice came the words rushed out like a torrent, "Ye're me child, faith, and he's me father-will ye take me all away? What is't ye're driving at? I'll throw meself into the river the day it runs 'twixt you and me-the day you go up to the island I'll go down wid the dead. D'ye hear? Ain't it enough to break me heart-wid you a-trying to git away from me so? Now stop that! I'll do me best for yees-in faith I will-but now, <emph>don't</emph> be afflictin' me"-Kit broke down completely here. Her usually<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6043-00000171"/> loud, cheery voice sunk to a husky whisper before she had half finished what she had to say.</p> 
                  <p>"Kit, tell me then, you know. When I am gone as Jane did"-Jenny did not pause with this, though aware of Kit's conclusive start-" I must go some time, you know. You said that everybody must." Well she understood the meaning of the grasp Kit made at her hand-it was as much as to say that while she could keep her, Jenny should not go. "Do you think I'll be blind <emph>then?</emph> blind always, Kit?"</p> 
                  <p>"No," almost shouted Kit, "ye'll see! ye will, dear."</p> 
                  <p>Jenny said no more; but looking into the meek, and now tranquil face of the child, Kit was not mistaken when she thought she could discover a new joy there; a new desire; even for that release which should bring her to sight of all the beauty which, with the unfolding inward vision, had grown upon her imagination, called into life by the ministry of Kit.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE INFINITE CONSOLATION.</head> 
                  <p>THIS hope never faded; it brightened in Jenny's soul; day by day her face bore witness to its radiance; and poor Kit beheld the brightening, and watched and labored on, until in December the Day broke on her child.</p> 
                  <p>That December found the Irish girl alone-for the old man died before Jenny, and Kit's labors for her household were then at an end. The country-the Greenwood, full of graves, to her. Her childhood, her girlhood, had ended long before.</p> 
                  <p>Who can tell the womanhood on which she has entered? What shall be Kit's fate? fate? To die maybe of starvation and lingering disease, in one of those dark cellars where thousands die unheeded victims, martyrs, slaves-to-day it maybe, or to-morrow, or the day after. To be swept down by pestilence, perhaps, in the street, or, on her bed, as it may happen- <q>

She SHALL dwell in THE COUNTRY when the city has done all it can for her; and then she shall not find it the place of graves-or-convicts. Cloudless the sky shall spread above her head, and her forehead shall be lustrous with the beauty of eternal youth and peace; and beneath her feet the way shall be smooth and easy: without taint shall the fair River of Life flow, and drinking of it she shall thirst no more for ever.</p> 
                  <p>The garden bloom and fragrance shall not always be withheld. She, the weary-but never with ill-doing-shall come finally to Him, who calls the heavy laden, and will give Rest to them. Soiled her mean garments may be, but they shall be whitened as no fuller on earth could white them-and her eyes shall be opened, as Jenny's eyes have been, and God himself shall wipe away her tears.</p> 
                  <p>Kit! I have called <emph>you</emph> poor! false speaking-false and foolish. Your path of earth leads up mid the eternal hills-the sun that never sets is shining on them, and around you.
